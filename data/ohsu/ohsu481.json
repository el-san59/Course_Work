Mean operative mortality in the 14 reports was 3.7% (1.2-8.5%). The mean incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction was 9.9% (3.8-17%). The mean incidence of postoperative low cardiac output was 16% (8-35%). No risk factors for morbidity or mortality different from those observed in patients with chronic stable angina were identified. Clinical subgroups of the heterogeneous group of patients with unstable angina pectoris are associated with different prognoses and treatment results. Variable pathological changes are associated with these subgroups. Reductions in morbidity and mortality of those patients undergoing CABG may require better preoperative management of the underlying pathological process and improved myocardial preservation at the time of CABG. Angina relief, improved survival, and reduction in late nonfatal myocardial infarction is similar to that observed in patients with chronic stable angina after CABG.\r"

Over 90% of patients survive 5 years, and approximately 80% survive 10 years. Some of the incremental risk factors for early death after operation include older age; degree of left ventricular dysfunction; hemodynamic instability at the time of operation; recent myocardial infarction; number of diseased coronary vessels; associated mitral incompetence, ventricular aneurysm, or ventricular tachycardia; longer aortic cross-clamp time; and non-use of the internal mammary artery for revascularization. The number of diseased coronary arteries and the aggressiveness of the atherosclerotic process, degree of left ventricular dysfunction, older age, and non-use of the internal mammary artery are risk factors for reduced long-term survival.\r"

The local recurrence rate in the tumors that metastasized was 63%, suggesting that GCTs that metastasize may be an aggressive form of the tumor. The overall mortality rate was 16%. Persistent pulmonary disease does not carry a poor prognosis; surgical resection of accessible pulmonary nodules is recommended to provide histologic confirmation of the diagnosis, and prevent future complications secondary to local growth of the implants, as well as provide a potential cure. Chemotherapy has not improved survival and is associated with significant morbidity and is thus not recommended. Adjuvant radiation is recommended only for control of surgically unresectable lesions because of its potential association with sarcomatous degeneration in GCT.\r"

The temporary systemic immunosuppressant regimens investigated were cyclophosphamide, azathioprine and prednisolone, cyclosporine A, and total lymphoid irradiation. The most successful appeared to be cyclosporine A, but significant side effects were observed. To specifically inhibit the immune response in the allograft antigens without systemically inhibiting the entire immune system, passive enhancement and preadministration of donor blood were tried. Neither was as effective as coating the donor bone with biodegradable cements, a method previously found to be successful. Cyclosporine A was investigated in dogs in a preliminary study of medial compartmental knee allografts and was found to be successful in inhibiting the antibody response and in producing a more successful graft; however, some significant side effects were similarly observed.\r"

  ".U": "89250048\r", 
  ".W": "Xenogeneic (bovine) bone morphogenetic protein (bBMP) and associated insoluble noncollagenous proteins (NCP) were implanted in inbred adult beagle dogs with 3-4 cm diaphyseal defects in the ulna. Defects were stabilized with internal plate fixation, and the control defects were not stabilized. The defects were implanted with either autogeneic cancellous bone grafts (ACG), bBMP/NCP, or a composite of ACG and bBMP/NCP. Of the plated ulnae, 18 of 19 ACG controls restored bone continuity; six of seven defects healed under the influence of bBMP/NCP plus ACG. Two of four defects with bBMP/NCP plus ACG healed and two were filled with osseous tissue, but fibrous tissue developed at one or both bone ends. Eight of nine defects implanted with bBMP/NCP capsules alone were repaired with fibrous tissue only. Of the nonplated defects, four were implanted with bBMP/NCP plus ACG and only one regenerated; three of four showed hypertrophic bone growth around a pseudarthrosis. Of six nonplated defects implanted with bBMP/NCP without ACG, all developed atrophic bone ends and fibrous tissue repair. Thus, to restore continuity of large segmental defects three times greater than the critical size for spontaneous regeneration, xenogeneic bBMP/NCP failed to induce bone regeneration in dogs. To exclude cell-mediated immune reactions and soft-tissue ingrowth, one defect was bridged with a polytetrafluoroethylene semipermeable tube (pore size 0.45 micron) containing implants of bBMP/NCP. In response to bBMP/NCP, cells from the host bone ends produced ossicles of induced woven bone formation. The observation that bBMP/NCP induced bone formation across the defect inside of semipermeable cylindrical chambers suggests that the experiments on bone defects larger than the critical size for spontaneous repair should be repeated with: (1) allogeneic dog BMP/NCP; (2) semipermeable cylinders to protect against muscle interposition; (3) compartment angiograms to evaluate blood supply; (4) treatment of the recipient with immunosuppressants and immunostaining to observe the concentration gradient of BMP; and (5) histologic observations on the first three days after implantation to evaluate cell-mediated immune barriers to the response of BMP.\r"

This relative rarity is further complicated by the potentially subtle nature of vascular injury. Doppler signals and even palpable pulses do not exclude vascular damage. Missed or delayed diagnosis with a subsequent avoidable amputation is a too-frequent result. Displaced fractures of the distal femur and proximal tibia and particularly dislocation of the knee are associated with the highest risk of concomitant vascular injury and the poorest collateral circulation to support the distal limb. Optimal management of such injuries requires a high index of suspicion, aggressive use of angiography, and close cooperation among all members of the trauma team. With proper care, few extremities will be lost to ischemia alone. Limb loss should result only when the extremity has been too badly damaged to justify salvage efforts.\r"

Despite treatment with chronic antibiotics, muscle flaps, hyperbaric oxygen, and/or free-tissue transfer, failures are common due to inadequate bone debridement. All bony fragments with marginal soft-tissue attachments and exposed bone without evidence of adequate blood flow must be removed during debridement for optimal results. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) may be a useful adjunct for the assessment of bone viability during both initial and subsequent debridements. Preliminary data on eight patients have demonstrated that bone blood flow as determined by LDF is highly correlated with clinical outcome. In 13 cases, LDF has proved to be helpful in the management of chronic osteomyelitis.\r"

Newer techniques such as free-tissue transfer can expedite wound care, decrease morbidity and hospital costs, and spare some limbs from amputation. It is important to know the mechanism of injury and the resultant zone of soft-tissue trauma. This is best defined by serial debridements over several days. The final defect size and composition will determine the type of soft-tissue flap used. Soft-tissue coverage may be accomplished with muscle, with muscle and skin transposition, or with free transfer. Microvascular transfers offer the advantage of one procedure that provides coverage for donor and recipient sites with early patient mobilization.\r"

Successful skeletal reconstruction has been reported following tumor resection, select traumatic skeletal defects, congenital pseudarthrosis, and both infected and uninfected skeletal nonunions unresponsive to conventional methodology. Incorporation of the graft into the recipient is not as dependent on an uninfected well-vascularized host as a conventional avascular autogenous graft is. Vascularized autografts are also capable of achieving union across large skeletal defects with fewer stress fractures than when avascular autografts are used to span a defect greater than 6 cm. With patency of the vascular anastomoses and union at both ends of the graft, hypertrophy of the segmental graft is not unusual. The overall success rate of ultimate bony union is approximately 80% and is mostly dependent on the recipient location. As discussed in this article, vascularized autografts are a salvage procedure to be used in reconstructing extremities in which conventional reconstructive techniques have failed or are not applicable.\r"

His methods, which use a universal system of ring external fixators with tensioned transosseous wires, were developed over the past 35 years at his institute in Kurgan, USSR. These noninvasive techniques have proved successful in over 300,000 patients (adults and children) treated for bone shortening and intercalary deficiency, angulatory and rotational malalignment, active infection, ischemia, joint contractures, and nonunions. Bone transportation involves moving a free segment of living bone to fill intercalary bone defects with vital bone. The trailing end of the transport bone segment maintains continuity with the host bone surface by distraction osteogenesis. The leading end of the transport bone segment fuses to the target bone surface by transformational osteogenesis. The small diameter of the transosseous wires contributes to better patient tolerance over the prolonged treatment times required for gradual distraction at 1 mm per day.\r"

The priorities of salvage of such injuries are early and accurate diagnosis, early reduction and stabilization, careful handling of soft tissues, tissue transfer to fill defects, and early motion. By these means it is possible to diminish the effects of edema, atrophy, stiffness, and osteoporosis. When initial treatment fails, salvage procedures must consider the length of disability, the expected functional outcome after salvage, and the lifestyle of the individual. Late salvage is by selective arthrodesis and realignment of mechanical relationships, followed by aggressive functional rehabilitation.\r"

The most common difficulty in the interpretation of psychoeducational test subscores and profiles is the significant overlap between the patterns generated by attentional deficits and those associated with memory-based learning disabilities. Certain other medical and behavioral conditions need to receive careful consideration prior to finalizing the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). A thorough but focused general examination coupled with the pediatric neurodevelopmental examination can contribute to this differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Neonatal surgery emerged as a fledgling in the 1930s and 1940s in restricted regional centers of the world where the pioneer pediatric surgeons were located. It galvanized into a bona fide pediatric surgical subspecialty during the 1950s, lead by those children's hospitals that developed neonatal surgical units and training centers. These institutions produced increasing numbers of highly trained young pediatric surgeons who fanned out to bring their expertise to other academic surgical centers. The 1960s saw both neonatologists and pediatric surgeons enriching the care of newborns in community and private hospitals in developed countries. Pediatric anesthesiologists, pediatric radiologists, and perinatologists joined ranks in the 1970s, extending care to the fetus as well as the newborn. Technologic developments such as ultrasound, computer tomography (CT), sophisticated ventilators, and advances in parenteral nutrition revolutionized both diagnosis and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging, ECMO, cine CT, and sophisticated improvements in other areas have increased the scope and expanded the horizons of neonatal care in the 1980s, improving treatment yield and reducing morbidity and mortality of newborns who suffer from major medical and surgical diseases. Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan recently have built neonatal surgical centers where high-quality care and training is offered. Almost every developing country now has surgeons who are partially or completely trained in pediatric surgery and who are on the faculty of their major medical teaching centers. There is every reason to believe that the next pediatric surgical issue of Clinics in Perinatology will describe further revolutionary advances in the care of the newborn patient, in areas now sacrosanct to perinatologists, neonatologists, and pediatric surgeons of this generation.\r"

Although history and physical examination, plain radiographs and ultrasonography will confirm most diagnoses, severe unilateral hydronephrosis, hemorrhagic neuroblastoma, and intraperitoneal cysts may provide diagnostic difficulties. Masses identified by prenatal ultrasound need careful evaluation as they may represent normal structures, nonsignificant variants, or physiologically significant anomalies. Many lesions will require operative intervention, which can be safely performed in small infants by trained personnel at facilities with appropriate support services. Genuine controversy exists in the management of some of these lesions including MDK, renal vein thrombosis, and acalculous cholecystitis.\r"

  ".W": "Accurate fetal diagnosis became possible by the steadily increasingly complex techniques of amniocentesis, ultrasound, and ultrasound-guided fetal blood sampling and chorion villous sampling. A high degree of diagnostic accuracy for a wide variety of structural and metabolic anomalies is required. The field of fetal diagnosis has been extended to the point that a journal dedicated to this subject alone is a viable proposition. It is becoming apparent, however, that lesions that were well known and well understood when recognized in neonatal life appear in general to have a worse prognosis if the lesion is diagnosed in utero. Fetal surgery began with attempts to perform in utero transfusions for babies with erythroblastosis fetalis. For a while, there was competition between open surgical procedures and the percutaneous placement of blood through catheters introduced into the fetal peritoneal cavity from outside the mother's abdomen. For fetal transfusion, closed techniques proved far safer and just as efficacious. There has been a worldwide interest in shunting of hydrocephalus and obstructive uropathy. The results of shunting hydrocephalus have been disappointing, with most of the patients surviving, but most of the survivors being severely handicapped. The results of shunting obstructive uropathy were that only about 50 per cent of the babies survived, but it appeared that those that did survive did well. Other lesions that have been shunted have been hydrothoraces or fetal ascites. A limited number of open procedures have been carried out in the last few years in San Francisco, and it may well be that diaphragmatic hernia (in appropriately selected patients) will be a lesion that can be corrected by in utero surgery. The future of this field is exciting, but before this form of treatment becomes routine, the ethical implications of the possibility of fetal surgery must be defined much more clearly than is currently the case.\r"

Premature infants between 34 and 37 weeks' conceptual age undergo rapid maturation of renal function similar to term infants, with establishment of glomerulotubular balance early in the postnatal period. ARF in neonates differs from that seen in older children and adults in that ischemic (e.g., hypoxic) insults and congenital malformations constitute the major pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for clinically observed oliguria and azotemia. Principles of conservative management are similar to those used in older children except for the greatly increased insensible water loss requirements of the very preterm and premature infant. Technical advances have added peritoneal dialysis and CAVH to the therapeutic regimen for persistent ARF or life-threatening complications of reduced renal function.\r"

Fortunately for these nonverbal neonates, the personnel involved in this perioperative care are now more sensitive to their analgesic and anesthetic needs. With adequate preoperative preparation and intraoperative monitoring, safe anesthesia at present can be provided to most critically ill neonates, using the guidelines outlined above. In addition, the postoperative period also can be made pain free for them by a judicious selection of analgesic and local anesthetic drugs.\r"

This is largely a result of the overwhelming evidence that neonates have the neurologic substrate for the perception of pain and display characteristic behavioral, physiologic, metabolic, and hormonal responses to noxious stimuli. The management of postoperative pain in the surgical neonate begins in the operating room, where techniques can be chosen that will ease the transition into the postoperative period. For postoperative analgesia, the most widely used and effective agents are the narcotics morphine and fentanyl. They may be administered either intermittently or continuously, and with proper precautions may be given to both intubated and nonintubated newborns. Other medications for analgesia and sedation are not as well studied in the newborn, but chloral hydrate and the benzodiazepines are useful for sedation, and acetaminophen may be used for analgesia alone or for potentiating the effect of narcotics. In addition, a number of creative nonpharmacologic techniques are being developed and promise to further decrease the discomfort experienced by postoperative neonates.\r"

Abdominal distention, lethargy, and feeding intolerance are early signs of NEC that may progress to gastrointestinal bleeding and hemodynamic instability. The radiographic hallmark of NEC is pneumatosis intestinalis (air in the bowel wall). The ileum and colon are the usual sites of crepitant intestinal necrosis, leading frequently to perforation. In spite of appropriate medical therapy, about half of the infants with NEC develop intestinal gangrene or perforation and require surgery, consisting of bowel resection and enterostomy formation. The most common late complication, intestinal stricture, occurs in 15 to 35 per cent of recovered infants. Overall mortality from NEC ranges from 20 to 40 per cent. The etiology of NEC is poorly understood and is considered to be multifactorial, related to ischemia, bacterial colonization, and formula feedings in a susceptible infant. Future progress in the treatment of NEC may be achieved by earlier detection of necrosis, modification of gastrointestinal flora, or by bolstering the deficient gastrointestinal immune mechanisms of the premature neonate.\r"

The estimated HBF was calculated as the ratio of indocyanine green plasma clearance to one minus the hematocrit. Cardiac output was measured with Doppler ultrasound. CPAP caused HBF to decrease in 8 of 10 subjects (14.1% +/- 15.3%, mean +/- SD, p = 0.033) and cardiac index (CI) to decrease in all subjects (14.1% +/- 5.7%, p = 0.0001).

The synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane (TX) B2 by isolated glomeruli, cortical tubules, inner medullary slices and outer medullary slices was measured in salt-depleted (LNa) rats and in salt-depleted rats receiving captopril (LNa-CEI). Animals were studied before and after 4, 9 and 15 days of Na+ depletion. 2. Na+ balance was reached in LNa rats after 4 days. Blood pressure and creatinine clearance remained stable. Serum Na+ decreased from 140 +/- 1 to 126 +/- 1 mmol/l (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01). In contrast, LNa-CEI rats were unable to conserve Na+ adequately: fractional excretion of Na+ and natriuresis were constantly greater than in LNa animals. As a consequence, LNa-CEI rats developed severe hyponatraemia, lost weight and their creatinine clearance decreased. 3. The glomerular synthesis of PGE2, PGF2 alpha and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, but not of TXB2, was significantly increased in LNa rats. In LNa-CEI rats, the synthesis of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was similar to control values, but PGF2 alpha and TXB2 synthesis was elevated at day 9. In cortical tubules, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha were unaffected by Na+ depletion, but 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 were increased and a similar trend was observed in LNa-CEI rats. In outer medulla of LNa rats, a decrease in all the eicosanoids measured was observed at day 4. In LNa-CEI animals, the synthesis of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, but not of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2, was significantly depressed. In inner medulla, Na+ depletion only tended to decrease PGF2 alpha and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, but in the presence of captopril, the synthesis of all prostanoids was significantly decreased.\r"

The effects of angiotensin II (ANG II) infusion without and with simultaneous infusion of prostacyclin (PGI2; 1.4 pmol min-1 kg-1; 5 ng min-1 kg-1) have been studied in 16 women in second-trimester pregnancy. Ten received one infusion of ANG II alone, followed by its infusion together with PGI2; the remainder received two identical infusions of ANG II alone as controls. 2. PGI2 administration was associated with a small fall in diastolic pressure (P less than 0.01) and a proportionally greater rise in heart rate (P less than 0.001). Small rises in basal plasma renin and ANG II concentrations and a fall in aldosterone concentration were not statistically significant. 3. The diastolic pressor response to ANG II was blunted during PGI2 infusion by comparison with controls (P less than 0.025); this diminution in response was greatest in patients who had initially been most sensitive to ANG II (P less than 0.02). 4. The evoked increment in plasma aldosterone during ANG II infusion was considerably reduced (P less than 0.005) in the presence of PGI2. 5. These data further support the hypothesis of a role for PGI2 in relation to the blunted pressor response to ANG II of normal pregnancy. The apparent inhibitory effects of PGI2 on aldosterone secretion may partly explain the previously described dissociation between the renin-angiotensin system and aldosterone in pregnancy.\r"

All subjects were able to complete the exercise load on the two levels of salt intake. No differences in mean oxygen uptake, heart rate or rectal temperature during exercise were observed between the two salt intakes. 4. Plasma sodium, potassium and osmolality were similar on the two salt intakes both before and during exercise. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration were elevated after 2 weeks on the reduced salt intake and remained so during exercise. 5. The estimated sweat rate during exercise was similar on the two salt intakes but the loss of sodium was less on the low salt intake. 6. On the basis of these results it is concluded that moderate salt restriction does not impair the ability to exercise in a hot environment.\r"

The donor had a previous history of contact dermatitis from colophony, with a positive patch test. Although we cannot absolutely exclude active sensitization, it seems highly improbable because host immunity is severely restricted by the chemoradiotherapy used to prepare marrow graft recipients. The clinical data therefore suggest that sensitivity to colophony was passively acquired through marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Traditional lung management during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) calls for low inspiratory and expiratory pressures with low ventilator rate to achieve lung rest. However, rapid weaning of pressures to severely injured lungs commonly leads to marked increase in pulmonary opacification as seen on chest x-ray and loss of volume. We postulated that a sufficiently high level of PEEP could prevent this deterioration. Forty-six newborns, who required ECMO therapy for refractory respiratory failure, were maintained on 8 to 14 cm H2O PEEP. The peak pressure was 20 to 24 cm H2O, rate 10 to 15 breath/min, and FIO2 0.21. Forty-one (89%) of 46 patients survived to discharge. The duration of ECMO was significantly decreased compared to the national average (82.4 +/- 43 vs. 117.5 +/- 59 h). The lungs of most patients remained adequately expanded and free of severe pulmonary opacification. Eleven of 40 patients did show significant worsening of chest x-ray compared to baseline, but only one of 18 who were on PEEP of greater than or equal to 12 cm H2O showed such deterioration. No unexpected complications were encountered. These data suggest that the use of high PEEP during ECMO safely prevents deterioration of lung function and promotes more rapid lung recovery. PEEP levels of 12 to 14 cm H2O appear to be most effective.\r"

Patients eligible for the study were divided into three groups which received either cefoxitin (2 g iv for three doses/8 h), penicillin G (2 million U iv for four doses/6 h), or no antibiotic (control group). In the overall population, the incidence of EOP was 6.1% in the prophylaxis recipients vs. 7.2% in the control group (a 15.3% reduction). No statistically different rates of pneumonia or death were found among the groups. Patients with impaired reflexes on admission or prolonged ventilatory support were noted to have a lower incidence of EOP and an improved outcome when treated with cefoxitin.\r"

In comparison with CMV, HFJV significantly increased cardiac index, stroke index (SI), left ventricular stroke work index, and oxygen delivery index, and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance index both with and without PEEP; however, there were significant decreases in PaO2 and increases in intrapulmonary physiologic shunt ratio in HFJV without PEEP. SI without PEEP was significantly greater with HFJV when the peak airway pressure was synchronized with the diastole in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) than with CMV and with HFJV synchronized with the systole in PAP. These findings suggest that HFJV has hemodynamic advantages over CMV in dogs with chronically banded pulmonary artery and dilated right ventricle.\r"

For each pressure, a maximum, minimum, and mean value was determined in relation to its oscillations during the respiratory cycle. Thus, we compared the variations in MedP, LAP, and RAP in controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV), CMV with 5 cm H2O PEEP, synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), SIMV with 5 cm H2O PEEP, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and spontaneous respiration (SR). We built an experimental model to compare the measurements obtained by air-filled tubes inserted at surgery with those obtained by esophageal balloons filled with water. The maximum MedP did not vary significantly in these patients except when SIMV and SR were compared; however, the minimum MedP diminished significantly (p less than .001) in SIMV, SIMV-PEEP, CPAP, and SR, with negative inspiratory values reaching significant proportions. The mean values of MedP, LAP, and RAP showed a similar tendency although to a lesser degree. The experimental model revealed a strong linear relation between the values obtained with air-filled tubes and those obtained with water-filled esophageal balloons (r = .99, p less than .001). These results suggest that the mean values of MedP, LAP, and RAP do not reflect the dynamic variations in ventricular filling pressure accurately, nor the important negative inspiratory peaks that appear in different types of ventilation using spontaneous cycles with and without PEEP. These inspiratory peaks can overload the left ventricle by hydrostatic gradients, and lead to pulmonary edema in susceptible patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Internal medicine cardiovascular specialists and internists are going to be seeing increasing numbers of adult patients with congenital heart malformations, and most of them will have had one or more surgical or therapeutic catheter procedures. The nonsurgical cases will have either benign defects or important but inoperable anomalies, or the physician may encounter the rare case which, though amenable to surgery, has escaped operation until adult life. Among patients with postoperative congenital heart disease, a few are totally cured and require no special follow-up or any special precautions, e.g., those with certain cases of atrial septal defect of ostium secundum types, patent ductus arteriosus without pulmonary hypertension, and fully repaired total anomaly of pulmonary venous return. Others who are very much improved by definitive repair have residual defect for which surgical treatment was not attempted, e.g., bicuspid aortic valve in the patient who had surgical repair of coarctation or the patient with persistent cleft of a mitral valve leaflet for which no repair was attempted at the time of closure of the ostium primum type of atrial septal defect. Some patients have had incomplete and unsuccessful repair of a defect but yet are symptomatically improved compared with their preoperative status, e.g., those with tetralogy of Fallot with loss of right-to-left shunting by closure of the ventricular septal defect but persistent right ventricular outflow tract or pulmonary artery branch obstruction. Patients with persistently high intracardiac pressure from unrelieved obstruction are at higher risk for sudden death than they were preoperatively, especially those with a high grade of ventricular ectopy. Despite symptomatic improvement compared with the preoperative status, such cases must have reoperation, if feasible, as a means to prevent a sudden catastrophe. Patients with congenital malformations have symptoms that are distinctly different from those with acquired heart disease. Furthermore, their reactions to their problems and to their lives and work in relation to others are often colored by their restricted and overprotected childhoods, which were often filled with doctor visits, several admissions to the hospital, one or more operations, and usually several heart catheterizations. Otherwise, these patients are capable of the same level of achievement intellectually, and only a few have important defects of other systems that would interfere with their roles as independent and productive adults. The problem arises as to what group of physicians will care for these patients in the future.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A total of 2,560 specimens were processed from 727 patients. There were 435 positive specimens (17.0 percent), originating from 139 patients, 10 by microscopy only, 176 by culture only, and 249 on both microscopy and culture. Review of the hospital records showed that 107 patients had PTB, 1 had Mycobacterium kansasii colonization, and 31 were thought not to have PTB. Sensitivity and specificity were 53.1 and 99.8 percent for microscopy, 81.5 and 98.4 percent for culture, and 77.6 and 100 percent for microscopy and culture, respectively. Seventy-five microscopy specimens (46 patients) were reported as scanty-positive, of which five (four patients) were deemed false positives, yielding a positive predictive value of 93.3 percent. In those patients with positive sputum microscopy, acid-fast bacilli were detected in one of the first four specimens. Seven isolates (three patients) were mycobacteria other than tubercle (0.27 percent of specimens and 1.6 percent of mycobacteria cultured). Despite the ready availability of laboratory evidence of disease, only 73 percent of cases were diagnosed by ward staff and 36 percent notified by the primary physician. Eleven patients (10.3 percent) died, six of whom had not received diagnoses of PTB before death. Sputum microscopy and culture remains reliable despite Bayesian predictions when applied to a population with a decreasing incidence of tuberculosis.\r"

Ten hypertensive subjects, who had reacted with coughs during ACE-inhibitor therapy, were treated in a double-blind crossover fashion for two weeks with enalapril and with placebo. Enalapril reduced the PC20 value for histamine and augmented the dermal response. Circulating eosinophilic leukocyte level in venous blood dropped markedly after the histamine bronchoprovocation performed during enalapril treatment. Plasma substance P was reduced after histamine provocation performed during placebo treatment, whereas this reduction was abolished by enalapril. In this study, we have demonstrated ACE-inhibitor-induction of moderately increased bronchial reactivity in subjects with suspected ACE-inhibitor-elicited coughs. It is suggested that coughing during ACE-inhibitor therapy is due to an increased inflammatory state in the airways.\r"

On each occasion, twofold increasing doses of methacholine were given from 6.25 to 3,200 micrograms as cumulative doses, at five-minute intervals by means of a dosimeter Me.far MB3 (nebulization time 0.8 +/- 0.2s, output 5 +/- 0.2 microliters/puff). The FEV1 was measured initially and 1.5 and 3 minutes after each inhalation. The test was continued until either a fall of 20 percent or more in FEV1 was obtained or the last dose was reached. The results were expressed in terms of PD20, ie, the dose of methacholine producing a 20 percent fall in FEV1. Under these carefully controlled conditions, the 95 percent confidence intervals (as based on a single determination) corresponded to +/- 0.22 on a log10 scale or, in a more meaningful way, +/- 1.66 fold-difference in PD20 from one visit to the other.\r"

  ".W": "Recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) frequently occur in surgically shunted cirrhotic patients. The prevention of these episodes is based mainly on the long-term use of lactulose. Recently, lactitol, a nonabsorbable disaccharide similar to lactulose, has been proposed as an alternative in the management of HE. It has the advantage of being better tolerated and producing a more predictable catharsis. The effects of the two agents were compared in a controlled randomized study lasting six months involving 31 cirrhotic patients with portal-systemic shunt, of whom 40% experienced HE. The PSE index (mental state, EEG, asterixis, Raitan test, and ammonia) was assessed in each patient on entry to the study and every three months during treatment. Episodes of HE, side effects, and the patients' comments on efficacy, tolerability, and palatability were recorded. The dose required to induce two bowel movements per day was 48 +/- 25 ml of lactulose syrup and 36 +/- 7 g of lactitol. During the study, the number of patients who had an episode of HE and the PSE index was similar in both groups. The patients judged lactitol better from the point of view of palatability. Meteorism and flatulence, experienced by patients treated with lactulose, was not reported by the lactitol group. We concluded that lactitol is as effective as lactulose in the long-term prevention of episodes of HE in cirrhotics with portal-systemic shunt and may be better tolerated.\r"

Ultrasound, computed tomography, and several laboratory tests (SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) were analyzed for their ability to detect a biliary origin of the disease. Ultrasound and computed tomography could not reliably make the diagnosis in the 10 patients found to have biliary disease. Receiver-operator-characteristic curves revealed that none of the laboratory tests assessed had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to determine the diagnosis, although all tests showed higher mean values in biliary pancreatitis. SGPT gave the best discrimination (positive predictive value 53%, negative predictive value 94%, cut off 40 units/liter). Therefore, initial ERCP is suggested for a reliable diagnosis of biliary origin of acute pancreatitis.\r"

The mean caliber of the main pancreatic duct was 1.2 +/- 0.4 mm in controls and 1.8 +/- 0.9 in patients with chronic pancreatitis (P less than 0.025). In the control group a dilatation of the duct with a peak at the third minute was found. In patients with chronic pancreatitis a flatter profile of the response curve with a slower increase and inconstant return to basal values was found. A statistically significant difference was found between absolute variations of MPD caliber over basal values (1.7 +/- 1.06 in controls vs 0.8 +/- 0.69 in CP, P less than 0.005) and the dilatation index [(Dmax - D)/D] (1.31 +/- 0.6 in controls vs 0.66 +/- 0.69 in CP, P less than 0.005). The mean percent increase at the third minute was 131% in control subjects vs 53% of patients with CP (P less than 0.0005). In the five cases of CP showing a caliber increase greater than 100%, a persistent dilatation (100-200%) was found 15 min after secretin administration.

We compared the reproducibility of five measurements of MCTT after a conventional breakfast (380 kcal) taken with tea containing 20 g lactulose to five measurements of MCTT after 20 g lactulose in water in eight normal volunteers. Individual mean breakfast transit time was not significantly different from lactulose transit time in each of the seven subjects, but one had a breakfast transit time of 151 +/- 15 min and a lactulose transit time of 86 +/- 22 minutes (X +/- SD, P less than 0.001). The coefficient of variation of breakfast transit time (11.6 +/- 5.3%, range: 6.9-24.2%) was less than that of lactulose transit time (30.7 +/- 7.8%, range: 22.1-50.0%, P less than 0.001). In a second set of experiments, the liquid phase marker (99mTechnetium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid) emptied from the stomach more rapidly after the lactulose solution (T1/2 16.3 +/- 5.4) than after the breakfast (33.9 +/- 10.9 min, P less than 0.01) and MCTT was shorter after lactulose (77 +/- 32 vs 104 +/- 40 min, respectively, P less than 0.05). There was no correlation between MCTT of lactulose and breakfast and between half-time gastric emptying and MCTT of either lactulose or breakfast. We conclude that the ingestion of inert lactulose induces an abnormally rapid MCTT and that breakfast MCTT is a much more reproducible investigation and should be employed in studies requiring serial measurements.\r"

The sequential euglycemic clamp technique (5 mM) was used with insulin infusion rates of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mU.kg-1.min-1 in four steps of 2 h. The data were compared with nine control subjects and nine newly diagnosed euthyroid IDDM patients treated with insulin for 0.5 mo. Insulin sensitivity was increased in the patients (ED50 40 vs. 52 mU/L, range 43-70, in controls and 70 mU/L, range 59-120, in IDDM subjects). Insulin responsiveness was markedly elevated; the steady-state glucose infusion rate (SSGIR) of step 4 was 104 vs. 64 mumol.kg-1.min-1 (range 50-79) in controls and 61 mumol.kg-1.min-1 (range 47-69) in IDDM subjects. Insulin clearance was elevated in all steps (1-3, 20-23 vs. 9-15 ml.kg-1.min-1; 4, 18 vs. 6-12 ml.kg-1.min-1 in control and IDDM subjects). Parallel to the normalization of thyroid metabolism, insulin action (ED50 60 mU/L, SSGIR in step 4, 51 mumol.kg-1.min-1) and insulin clearance (steps 1-3, 11-14 ml.kg-1.min-1; step 4, 7 ml.kg-1.min-1) returned to the normal range in 6 mo. Both remained within the normal range until 12 mo. In the patient with newly diagnosed IDDM, the initial marked increases of insulin action and clearance were due to coexistent hyperthyroidism. With the amelioration of the hyperthyroid state, both processes became normal. The parallelism between insulin action and clearance suggests a functional relationship.\r"

The relevant biochemistry of lactic acidosis is reviewed, and the more controversial aspects relating to the genesis of the acidosis are highlighted. The current system of classification of lactic acidosis divides etiologies on the basis of the presence or absence of clinical signs of tissue hypoperfusion. Several types of lactic acidosis in which clinical evidence of tissue hypoperfusion is lacking demonstrate hemodynamic evidence of occult hypoperfusion. The diagnostic and therapeutic implications of this observation are discussed. Current diagnostic criteria for lactic acidosis include a pH less than 7.35 and blood lactate concentration greater than 5 to 6 mM/L. An important issue relates to the implications of lactate values that are greater than normal but below this diagnostic range. The use of the oxygen flux test may be valuable in the diagnosis of occult tissue hypoperfusion in patients with low-grade elevations in lactate levels. The current therapy for lactic acidosis involves addressing the primary cause and supportive management. The use of bicarbonate in the therapy for lactic acidosis is controversial due to potential adverse effects on cardiac function. The specifics of this controversy are outlined, and newer therapeutic alternatives are reviewed. The use of blood lactate concentration as a prognostic index may be more useful in patients with shock than without shock.\r"

  ".W": "Sudden death claims an estimated 350,000 lives per year in the United States. When death occurs within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms, 90% are the result of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The majority of victims are middle-aged men with coronary artery disease, but in approximately 25%, sudden death is the presenting manifestation of their problem. In some populations, the detection of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) by ambulatory monitoring is predictive of an increased risk of sudden death. However, the arrhythmia that best predicts this risk is unclear, and ambient arrhythmias are only a modest marker of this risk. Therapy to suppress asymptomatic PVCs has not been shown to be effective in preventing sudden death, and in some cases, lethal arrhythmias can be prevented without significant effects on ambient arrhythmias. Other risk markers such as depressed left ventricular function and the presence of low-amplitude, long-duration, late potentials recorded on a signal averaged electrocardiogram are more powerful predictors of risk than are PVCs. These latter findings in particular support the presence of areas of slow electrical conduction (a requirement for reentrant mechanism arrhythmias) and suggest that an abnormal electrical environment or \"substrate\" is the most important factor in this problem. The management of patients at risk for sudden death is controversial. While postinfarct survivors with arrhythmias constitute a population at increased risk, the absolute risk is only about 5% in the first year and has not been shown to be improved by conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Small study size, arrhythmia variability, ill-defined end points, and proarrhythmia may partially explain this apparent lack of efficacy. The prophylactic use of antiarrhythmic drugs other than beta-blockers to prevent sudden death in asymptomatic populations at risk is therefore of unproven benefit. By contrast, patients who have survived a life-threatening arrhythmia unrelated to an acute myocardial infarction have an approximately 30% risk of recurrence in the following year. In these patients, the use of ambulatory monitoring to guide therapy is limited by the high incidence of false-negative responses (lethal arrhythmia recurrence despite ambient arrhythmia suppression) and the lack of frequent spontaneous arrhythmias in many patients. In this patient population, electrophysiological testing can be used to prognosticate recurrence and gain insight into arrhythmia mechanism, stability, and hemodynamic tolerance. The technique is also useful in guiding both pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

They secrete low amounts of islet hormones, are unresponsive to glucose, and display pluripotency. A minority of RIN cells react with monoclonal antibodies A2B5 and 3G5 which recognize complex gangliosides on normal islet cells. In order to determine whether the expression of A2B5- or 3G5-reactive gangliosides is modulated during differentiation RIN cells were cultured with various concentrations of sodium butyrate (NaB), a known inducer of cellular differentiation. Expression of A2B5- and 3G5-reactive gangliosides was determined by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytofluorimetry. NaB exposure resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation over 5 days of 1.5-, 2.9-, and 17.5-fold at 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mM, respectively, and a distinct change in cellular morphology. Cells exposed to NaB displayed prominent neurite-like projections. At 3 mM NaB, insulin secretion increased 7.9-fold and the percentage of cells expressing A2B5- and 3G5-reactive gangliosides increased by up to 4.4- and 5.5-fold, respectively. The expression of A2B5- or 3G5-reactive gangliosides per cell also increased, by 2.4- and 1.3-fold, respectively, at 3 mM NaB. These findings demonstrate that the expression of cell surface A2B5- and 3G5-reactive gangliosides is not static but increases with cell differentiation. NaB-treated RIN cells may serve as a model to study the role of gangliosides in the function and lineage relationships of islet cells.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the CRF gene in the hypothalamus and that of the POMC gene in the anterior pituitary are reduced during the first week of life in the rat. During this so-called stress nonresponsive period (SNRP), stimuli such as ether vapors, electroshocks, and hypoxia do not elicit ACTH secretion from the pituitary, as occurs later in development. The current hypothesis to explain the SNRP is an increased negative glucocorticoid feedback on POMC and CRF synthesis and/or release during this time. To test this hypothesis we studied the effects of adrenalectomy (ADX) on anterior pituitary POMC mRNA expression. In 7-day-old rats POMC mRNA levels were increased only 3-fold 48 h post-ADX, compared to a 7-fold increase in 14-day-old animals. This blunted effect of endogenous glucocorticoid removal on pituitary POMC mRNA could be due to decreased up-regulation of CRF after removal of glucocorticoids or normal up-regulation of CRF but decreased pituitary responsiveness to CRF relative to those in 14-day-old animals. Therefore, we studied in vitro beta-endorphin release from pituitaries obtained from 7- and 14-day-old rats. CRF stimulated basal beta-endorphin release to the same extent in pituitaries from both groups. The inhibition by corticosterone of CRF-stimulated beta-endorphin secretion was also indistinguishable in pituitaries obtained from 7- or 14-day-old rats. Since the responsiveness of the 7-day-old pituitary was normal, the blunted enhancement of POMC biosynthesis after ADX must be mediated at the level of the hypothalamus. Indeed, in situ hybridization showed that while in 14-day-old rats ADX induced a significant increase [190 +/- 10% (+/- SE) of control; n = 5; P less than 0.0005] in hypothalamic mRNA levels, ADX did not change the expression of the CRF gene in the paraventricular nucleus of 7-day-old rats, indicating a lack of glucocorticoid modulation of hypothalamic CRF synthesis. Finally, we studied the effects of 48 h CRF treatment on the post-ADX increase in POMC mRNA levels in 7-day-old rats. Daily injections of 200 ng CRF/rat induced an increase in anterior pituitary POMC mRNA concentrations [669 +/- 139% (+/- SE) of control; n = 6; P less than 0.02 vs. adrenalectomized vehicle-treated rats] comparable to that in adrenalectomized untreated 14-day-old rats. In conclusion, our data indicate that the glucocorticoid regulation of hypothalamic CRF gene expression is not mature during the first week of life, i.e. within the so-called SNRP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Neither irradiation protocol had an effect on the body weight of the animals. Neutron plus gamma-rays induced dramatic damages to spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, spermatozoa, and, to a lesser extent, pachytene spermatocytes. In contrast, gamma-rays induced a selective destruction of spermatogonia. Subsequently, in both experiments a maturation-depletion process led to a marked decrease in all germ cell types. A complete or near complete recovery of the different germ cell types and spermatozoa took place during the two postirradiation periods. Under both irradiation protocols Sertoli cells number was unchanged. Androgen-binding protein and FSH levels were normal in spite of the disappearance of most germ cells from spermatogonia to early spermatids. However, the decline of androgen-binding protein as well as the rise of FSH and their subsequent recovery were highly correlated to the number of late spermatids and spermatozoa. Moreover, it appeared that spermatocytes may also interfere with the production of inhibin (Exp B). With neither irradiation was Leydig cell function altered, except in Exp B in which elevated LH levels were temporarily observed. Correlation analysis suggested a relationship between preleptotene spermatocytes and Leydig cell function. In conclusion, this study establishes that chronic gamma-irradiation is particularly useful in the study of intratesticular paracrine regulation in vivo and provides further support to the concept that late spermatids play a major role in controlling some aspects of Sertoli cell function in the adult rat.\r"

  ".W": "T3 produced a prompt and biphasic change in the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (dGlc) by atria, ventricles, diaphragm, and fat in the rat in vivo. At the lower physiological doses T3 produced a dose-related increase in tissue dGlc uptake; the lowest effective concentration was 5-10 ng/100 g BW, and maximal effect of about 75-100% increase above control values was seen at a T3 dose of 25 (diaphragm) or 100 ng. At pharmacological doses of 5 and 50 micrograms/100 g BW T3 inhibited dGlc uptake by about 50%. Evaluation of the physiological related stimulatory effect of T3 on dGlc uptake in the four tissues revealed that it was independent of new protein synthesis, because it was not inhibited by cycloheximide which blocked [3H]leucine incorporation by more than 95%, and that it was thyroid hormone specific, as judged from the order of potency of several T3 analogs: 3'-isopropyl-L-T2 greater than or equal to L-T3 greater than L-T4 = D-T3 greater than D-T4; L-rT3, 3,5-L-T2, and DL-thyronine were without effect. Additional studies demonstrated that in the four tissues employed T3 acted to promote sugar uptake by increasing the activity of the sugar transport system located at the plasma membrane. The present study together with previous in vitro and in vivo studies, in the same and other tissues, provide a strong evidence in support of a physiological role for the action of thyroid hormone at the level of the plasma membrane to increase cellular sugar uptake.\r"

To determine the specific factors that are involved in the regulation of chick kidney PKI, chicks were raised on a low (0.05%), normal (1%), or high (3%) calcium diet and given vitamin D3 or vehicle three times a week orally. The results from this experimental protocol show that vitamin D3 or one or more of its metabolites and serum calcium levels are both involved in the regulation of chick kidney PKI in vivo. Measurement of PKI activity in primary cultures of chick kidney cells revealed treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3) led to a 90-95% decrease in PKI activity. This effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 was dose dependent, and neither PTH nor insulin was able to reverse it completely. Treatment with PTH caused 30-60% increase in PKI activity, and cell cultures that were grown in medium containing either 0.5 or 2 mM calcium chloride had similar PKI activities. Taken together, these results indicate that 1,25-(OH)2D3, the most physiologically active form of vitamin D3, is the predominant regulator of PKI, but serum calcium, indirectly through the regulation of PTH secretion, is also involved.\r"

Extensive hybridization was observed with ZG mRNA, and only slight binding was seen with ZF/M mRNA. These results extend earlier reports from this laboratory indicating that the enzymic activity for renin is predominantly localized in ZG cells. Hence, high message levels account for the high enzymic activity. Adrenal ZG poly(A)+ RNA was also isolated from rats maintained on normal and sodium-deplete diets for 15 days and was hybridized to the radiolabeled 698-bp renin probe. Essentially twice the amount of probe was bound to the message from salt-deplete ZG tissue compared to message from normal ZG per microgram mRNA. Hybridization was proportional to the amount of poly(A)+ RNA employed over the range of 0-1 microgram, suggesting the applicability of this procedure for approximate quantitation purposes. The membranes were freed from the 32P-labeled renin cDNA and subsequently rehybridized with a 32P-radiolabeled 1200-bp beta-actin cDNA probe. It was observed that ZF/M poly(A)+ RNA contained more beta-actin message than ZG poly(A)+ RNA, indicating a greater transcription rate for beta-actin in ZF/M tissue in contrast to transcription of the renin gene.\r"

POMC biosynthesis has been documented in the testis, specifically in Leydig cells, and recent studies suggest that CRF is synthesized locally in the testis. A reverse hemolytic plaque assay and immunocytochemistry with Leydig cell-specific antibodies were used to study the effect of CRF on secretion of the POMC peptide beta-endorphin (beta EP) from normal rat primary Leydig cell cultures. In enriched Leydig cell preparations incubated with beta EP antiserum (diluted 1:50) then with complement (diluted 1:25), approximately 15% of immunocytochemically identified Leydig cells formed plaques. Preabsorption of the antiserum with beta EP (2 micrograms/microliters antiserum) overnight at 4 C abolished the formation of plaques. Increasing concentrations of CRF (from 10(-1) to 10(-7) M) resulted in an approximately 80% increase in both the percentage of plaque-forming cells and the mean plaque size. When the CRF antagonist CRF-(9-41) (10(-6) M) was added in the presence of CRF, the increases in plaque number and average size did not occur. These results demonstrate that Leydig cells have functional CRF receptors and that beta EP secretion from these cells is stimulated by CRF.\r"

Pancreastatin immunoreactivity has been localized to islet B and D cells in the porcine pancreas. We have developed a RIA for this peptide, using rabbit anti-porcine pancreastatin antibodies and 125I-Tyr-pancreastatin. Isolated pig pancreata were perfused with a nonrecirculating bicarbonate buffer solution containing 4% Dextran and 0.1% Albumin. Glucose (11 mmol/liter) induced a biphasic release of pancreastatin-like immunoreactivity (PLI). Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves (8 Hz), as well as perfusion with acetyl choline (10(-6) mol/liter) in the presence of 5.5 mmol/liter glucose, also evoked prompt PLI responses. Furthermore, truncated GLP-1 (proglucagon 78-107; 10(-9) mol/liter) induced PLI release. All tested stimuli also elicited insulin secretion. To investigate whether the PLI measured could be ascribed to secretion of the low molecular weight pancreastatin (Mr 5,100) or to a possible precursor such as chromogranin A (Mr approximately 75,000), perfusates containing PLI were subjected to gel filtration on an Ultropac G3000SW column. All of the PLI was recovered at the elution position of the pancreastatin marker. In conclusion, PLI and insulin are released in parallel from the perfused porcine pancreas, exposed to stimuli known to affect insulin release.\r"

We have reported that IGF-I stimulates the release of decidual PRL, acting through the type I IGF receptor (1). To determine whether insulin regulates the synthesis and secretion of decidual PRL, monolayer cultures of human decidual cells were exposed to insulin at concentrations ranging from 10 ng to 10 micrograms/ml for up to 5 days. Insulin stimulated a dose-dependent increase in PRL release (half-maximal concentration, 50 ng/ml), beginning 48 h after initial exposure. Insulin-exposed cells released 62 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM), 97 +/- 3% and 82 +/- 6% more PRL than control cultures on days 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Insulin also stimulated de novo PRL synthesis. During the final 24-h culture period, insulin-exposed cells released 73 +/- 7% more immunoprecipitable [35S]-methionyl PRL than control cells, comparable to the 60 +/- 7% increase in PRL (by RIA) during the same period. Insulin effects were relatively specific to PRL, since insulin had a much smaller effect on the synthesis of total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable proteins. Additionally, insulin had no significant effect on cell number, total DNA, or total cellular protein. Specific and saturable insulin-binding sites were observed in decidual cells, and polyclonal antibodies to the insulin receptor acted as insulin agonists, stimulating an increase in PRL release comparable to that produced by insulin alone. These observations suggest that the responses to insulin are mediated through the insulin receptor. Furthermore, our studies suggest that insulin may have a role in the regulation of PRL synthesis and release from human decidua.\r"

  ".U": "89251478\r", 
  ".W": "In previous communications we described an in vitro model system containing highly purified thyroid peroxidase (TPO) for studying the mechanism of inhibition of thyroid hormone biosynthesis by the antithyroid drugs, 6-propylthiouracil (PTU) and 1-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole (MMI). We showed that inhibition of iodination of thyroglobulin in this system may be reversible or irreversible depending on the relative concentrations of iodide and drug and the TPO concentration. Metabolism of the drugs occurred under both conditions, but was more limited under irreversible conditions of inhibition. It was of interest to examine the nature of the drug metabolites associated with reversible and irreversible conditions of inhibition. For this purpose we have employed the 35S- and 14C-labeled drugs and a recently developed reverse phase HPLC procedure. Results of a similar study with MMI were reported in an earlier communication. In the present study we report our findings with PTU. Under conditions of reversible inhibition, PTU was readily metabolized and by 15 min was reduced to a few percent of the starting value. The earliest detectable metabolite with both [35S]- and [14C]PTU was the disulfide, which reached a peak in about 15 min and then slowly declined. Coincident with the decline in the disulfide was the appearance of more polar metabolites. In the case of [35S]PTU, these corresponded to sulfate/sulfite, PTU sulfonate, and a product tentatively identified as PTU sulfinate. The latter two were also observed as 14C-labeled metabolites produced from [14C]PTU. Two nonpolar desulfurated 14C-labeled metabolites were also observed. Surprisingly, these did not correspond to either propyluracil or propyldeoxyuracil, the anticipated most likely products of PTU desulfuration. The identity of these desulfurated metabolites of PTU in the TPO model system remains to be determined. Under conditions of irreversible inhibition of iodination, a relatively small fraction of PTU was metabolized. PTU disulfide was, again, the earliest detectable metabolite, and it declined with time. However, only small amounts of other metabolites were observed, in contrast to the results obtained under conditions of reversible inhibition of iodination. As in the case of MMI, the difference in metabolic pattern between reversible and irreversible conditions is primarily related to the rapid inactivation of TPO that occurs under irreversible conditions. In general, the metabolism of PTU by the TPO model system resembled that previously observed with MMI. With both drugs, the disulfide was the earliest detectable metabolite, and under conditions of reversible inhibition of iodination, an appreciable fraction of the sulfur was oxidized as far as sulfate/sulfite.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89251479\r", 
  ".W": "The antithyroid drug 6-propylthiouracil (PTU) was previously shown in our laboratory to have an unexpectedly prolonged inhibitory effect on iodination in the thyroid glands of rats. Eighteen hours after injection of a relatively small dose, iodination in the thyroid remained inhibited by more than 90%. We previously suggested that the prolonged inhibitory effect might be due to inactivation of thyroid peroxidase (TPO), a reaction previously shown to occur under certain conditions in an in vitro iodinating system containing highly purified TPO. However, the analytical procedure used in our earlier study did not exclude the possibility that sufficient PTU remained in the thyroid even after 18 h to inhibit TPO-catalyzed iodination by a reversible mechanism. Development of an improved analytical procedure, based on HPLC, led us to reexamine the mechanism of the prolonged inhibitory effect of PTU on iodination in rat thyroid glands. Rats were injected with [35S]PTU (1 mumol/100 g BW), and ultrafiltrates prepared from their homogenized thyroid glands were analyzed by HPLC. The major 35S-labeled metabolites were identified as sulfate/sulfite, PTU sulfinate, and PTU sulfonate. However, even after 18 h, a significant amount of unchanged [35S]PTU was also present. The calculated mean concentration of residual PTU was 20 microM, a sufficiently high level to explain the observed inhibition of iodination on the basis of a reversible mechanism. Experiments were also performed to examine the intrathyroidal distribution of 35S at intervals after the injection of [35S]PTU. All of the oxidation products of PTU showed marked increases between 2 and 16 h after injection. Based on our view that TPO is the major mediator of intrathyroidal metabolism of PTU, this observation is inconsistent with our previous proposal that TPO is inactivated after PTU injection. The results of the present study, therefore, lead us to withdraw our previous suggestion that TPO is inactivated after injection of PTU into rats. It is more likely that inhibition of iodination by PTU in the rat thyroid involves competition between PTU and tyrosyl residues of thyroglobulin for oxidized iodine, comparable to the reversible mechanism of inhibition observed in the TPO model system.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have documented that exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates prolactin (PRL) secretion and augments thyrotropin-releasing hormone-induced PRL release. Further, the concomitant pulsatile release of PRL and luteinizing hormone (LH) suggests that GnRH may be an important regulator of PRL release in certain physiologic states. The authors explored this possibility by evaluating the effect of a GnRH antagonist ([Ac-pClPhe1, pClPhe2, DTrp3, DAla10]-GnRH; GnRH-antagonist) on PRL secretion in monkeys with induced hyperprolactinemia. Monkeys were given estradiol (E2) benzoate 25 mg/kg intramuscularly (IM) on cycle days 1 to 28, and a 3-cm progesterone (P) silastic capsule was placed on cycle day 15 and removed on day 28. On cycle days 15 to 28, monkeys were given IM injections of 1 mg/kg GnRH-antagonist (n = 3), 2 mg/kg GnRH-antagonist (n = 3), or vehicle (n = 3). Daily blood samples were assayed for E2, P, and PRL. The degree of PRL elevation was calculated as percent increase in area under the curve for days 15 to 28 when compared with days 1 through 14 (baseline). Luteinizing hormone levels were calculated similarly. Results indicate a dose-dependent effect of GnRH-antagonist on PRL secretion, with the larger dose producing a significantly lower hyperprolactinemic response, as well as a decline in LH. Thus, GnRH-antagonist attenuates induced hyperprolactinemia in a dose similar to that which suppresses LH release. These findings suggest that GnRH is a physiologic regulator of pituitary PRL secretion. In addition, GnRH analogs may be of benefit in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation by attenuating gonadotropin-induced hyperprolactinemia, thereby reducing potential adverse effects on fertility.\r"

  ".U": "89252461\r", 
  ".W": "Although initially described two decades ago, biphasic insulin secretion has gradually been understood to reflect beta-cell rate sensitivity, be important in minimizing overinsulinization in normal individuals, be defective in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and be useful as an early predictor in prediabetic individuals. Recently, a third phase of insulin secretion has been observed in fully in vitro islets or pancreatic preparations. This phase is characterized as a spontaneous decline of secretion (desensitization) during 24 h of sustained exposure to glucose or other secretagogues and does not appear to be simply an artifact of in vitro preparations. The impaired secretion is localized to the final release process in that neither glucose-stimulated proinsulin synthesis nor its conversion to insulin is affected. The mechanisms responsible for the third phase of reduced secretion are unknown. Kinetic evidence suggests it is not caused by emptying of a single finite insulin storage compartment but does not exclude the possibility that the decreased release reflects depletion of threshold-sensitive beta-cells recruited at a given secretagogue level. Alternatively, the third phase may reflect inhibition of a priming or terminal insulin-release process by metabolic feedback. Because several secretagogues cause similar third-phase impaired release, even in the absence of glucose, desensitization probably occurs at a common fundamental site in the secretory site (e.g., calcium metabolism). Preliminary studies indicate the third phase is not the result of a paracrine effect by other islet hormones or of a change in muscarinic regulation. Whether other neurologic effectors are involved requires further investigation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After 5 days of culture in dishes allowing cell attachment, neoformed islets were kept free floating in RPMI-1640 medium (16.5 mM glucose, 1% fetal calf serum). The islets were then pulsed with [3H]leucine and [35S]methionine for 24 h. The conditioned medium was acidified with acetic acid (final pH 2.7), desalted, concentrated, and gel filtered on Bio-Gel P100 in acid conditions. The radioactive material that comigrated with immunoreactive insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) produced by the islets was pooled, concentrated, and further characterized by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a C18 Bondapak column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (20-80%). The radioactive material that eluted as pure IGF-I (40% acetonitrile) was further studied by chromatofocusing on a Pharmacia PBE 94 column. A sharp radioactive peak containing [3H]leucine and [35S]methionine was eluted at pH 8.55. This material was immunoprecipitated with an antiserum to IGF-I. This study demonstrated that fetal islet cells synthesize molecules that are, by several criteria, equivalent to native IGF-I.\r"

When SHR/N-cp rats are overtly diabetic, they are hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic in the fed state when consuming commercial chow or semipurified high-carbohydrate diets. Obese SHR/N-cp rats were hyperinsulinemic by 4 wk of age, although hyperglycemia did not appear until 3-4 wk later and was exacerbated by a high-sucrose diet (mean +/- SE 1488 +/- 238 microU/ml insulin and 425 +/- 51 mg/dl glucose). The control SHR/N-cp rats (+/?) on the sucrose diet remained lean and normoglycemic. The obese diabetic SHR/N-cp rats showed three alterations in pancreas perfusion data (not present in control rats): 1) paradoxically high insulin secretion at low glucose levels (2.5 mM), 2) secretion of insulin in response to arginine (10 mM) in the absence of glucose, and 3) impaired response of insulin secretion to high glucose (16.7 mM). To determine whether hyperglycemia was responsible for the abnormalities of insulin secretion, perfusion studies were conducted in obese nondiabetic LA/N-cp rats and compared with the SHR/N-cp rats. The obese LA/N-cp rats resembled the corpulent SHR/N-cp rats in every way, except that they were normoglycemic on the sucrose diet. The obese LA/N-cp rats had two of the three alterations in insulin secretion shown by obese SHR/N-cp rats, lacking only the impaired response to high glucose, suggesting that hyperglycemia was required for that defect to occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Insulin secretion in response to intravenous glucose and glucagon was significantly inhibited during the administration of CsA (areas under insulin-response curves, pmol.min-1.L-1; IVGTT, pre-CsA, 11,127 +/- 1285; during CsA, 5954 +/- 1147, P less than .05; glucagon tolerance test, pre-CsA, 18,617 +/- 2807; during CsA, 4401 +/- 486, P less than .05 vs. pretreatment levels). These secretory defects persisted 4 mo after CsA was discontinued (IVGTT, 4358 +/- 659; glucagon tolerance test, 10,567 +/- 2479, P less than .05). C-peptide responses paralleled these changes. Plasma glucose disposal in response to these secretagogues, however, returned to normal 1 mo after discontinuation of CsA. In contrast to the findings for IVGTT and glucagon, insulin-response curves to OGTT were not statistically different during CsA administration. We conclude that, although glucose disappearance rates are normal after discontinuation of the CsA administration, CsA causes irreversible impairment in islet secretory responses detectable with IVGTT and glucagon but not with OGTT. These results suggest that short-term CsA in doses required to prevent islet-allograft rejection in dogs can result in permanent loss of functionally competent beta-cells.\r"

Eight patients received a low dose (10 micrograms) of the analogue, 9 received a high dose (50 micrograms) of the analogue, and 9 received placebo subcutaneously before breakfast and dinner. Twenty-four-hour serum glucose, free insulin, plasma growth hormone (GH), and glucagon profiles were obtained before and during treatment at 4-wk intervals. The mean age, duration of diabetes, daily insulin dose, and body weight were not significantly different among the groups. The mean weekly capillary blood glucose values and exogenous insulin requirements were not changed by the SMS 201-995 therapy. Mean glycosylated hemoglobin A1 levels were unchanged in both the analogue- and placebo-treated groups at wk 12. Basal and postprandial glucose, free insulin, GH, and glucagon profiles were not influenced by the SMS 201-995 therapy throughout the study. Nocturnal glucose turnover rates (D-[3-3H]glucose technique) remained unaltered by the analogue therapy. Dose-dependent gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects (e.g., diarrhea) were documented in the analogue-treated patients. Visual acuity and fundic photomicrographs of our patients were not changed by the analogue therapy. In conclusion, the prominent adverse GI effects our patients experienced preclude the use of larger doses of the analogue that may be necessary to suppress GH and glucagon and improve glucose control in type I diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Primary cultures of microvascular endothelial cells and isolated adipocytes were prepared from human omental adipose tissue to study the potentially overlapping roles of insulin and insulinlike growth factors (IGFs) in human adipose tissue. To determine whether adipocytes contain type I IGF receptors, binding experiments were carried out with 125I-labeled IGF-I. At 16 degrees C, saturation of specific binding to adipocytes was reached after 30 min and was 0.7% per 10(6) cells. At 37 degrees C, chloroquine produced an increase in cell-associated 125I-IGF-I, suggesting that IGF-I is internalized and degraded in a manner analogous to insulin. In competition experiments, IGF-I competed for binding more effectively than rat IGF-II or insulin. The concentrations of IGF-I, rat IGF-II, and insulin necessary to displace 50% of 125I-IGF-I binding were 2.5, 15, and 90 nM, respectively. In addition, a monoclonal antibody (alpha-IR3) that has been shown to block the type I IGF receptor was used in competition binding experiments. The antibody also inhibited binding of 125I-IGF-I to adipocytes. The biological effects of insulin and IGF-I were examined by studying adipocyte lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Insulin stimulated [14C]glucose incorporation into cellular lipid in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.3 nM. However, an increase in LPL activity was observed only at a high insulin concentration, with an EC50 of approximately 30 nM. In contrast, IGF-I stimulated a progressive increase in LPL, with an EC50 of 3.2 nM. In addition, alpha-IR3 blocked the stimulatory effect of IGF-I on adipocyte LPL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the value of using plasma 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (AG) as a marker of glycemic control in diabetic patients, the relationship between the plasma concentration of AG and glucosuria was examined in 152 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). After recovery from the deterioration of glycemic control in NIDDM patients had started, AG began to increase day by day. The recovery of plasma AG showed a constant linear increase curve when excellent glycemic control was attained. The ordinary daily recovery rate of plasma AG was estimated to be 0.3 microgram/ml, which was independent of body weight, sex, age, the difference in treatment, the duration of diabetes, or the level of plasma AG among NIDDM patients. This rate decreased according to the increase in urinary glucose. When we calculated the decrease rate of plasma AG (delta AG), assuming 0.3 microgram/day to be the maximum increase rate in a day, we found a high correlation between delta AG and urinary glucose at almost all AG levels except the normal range and observed that plasma AG (A) times urinary glucose (G) was relatively constant. The formula A x G = 16 is a simple equation for rough estimation of urinary glucose from the plasma AG concentration in a stable glycemic-controlled NIDDM patient, and we call it the A.G index. The plasma AG also correlated significantly with fasting plasma glucose (r = -.810) and glycosylated hemoglobin (r = -.856) in the same stable glycemic-controlled NIDDM patients. Based on these observations, we propose that plasma AG can serve as a new marker that may provide sensitive and analytical information about glycemic control.\r"

Based on recent evidence showing that insulin has a direct effect on axon formation and neuronal survival in vitro, it was predicted that functional neuropathy would be present in the spinal cord of diabetic animals. Although structural lesions are encountered in the spinal cord of diabetic patients at autopsy, the functional corollaries have essentially remained unstudied. We used a new procedure to study evoked spinal cord potentials in the rat, which revealed a significant retardation in conduction velocity in streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic animals. This retardation was not due to a toxic effect of STZ on the involved spinal cord sensory pathways, because insulin infusion prevented the development of spinal cord neuropathy. The kinetics and magnitude of decline in conduction velocity were similar in the spinal cord, saphenous nerve, and common peroneal nerve during the first 2 wk, suggesting that a common mechanism was involved. After 10 wk, a spontaneous improvement in function was observed in the spinal cord and common peroneal nerve but not in the saphenous nerve. Our results support the hypothesis that central nervous system dysfunction can occur along with peripheral sensory neuropathy in diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Use of [3H]glucose and a one-compartment model to determine glucose kinetics frequently underestimates the rate of glucose production (Ra). To assess to what extent an isotope effect, a tracer contaminant, or inadequacy of the model was responsible, we measured glucose Ra and forearm clearance of tracer and unlabeled glucose at various concentrations of plasma insulin (approximately 50, approximately 160, and approximately 1800 microU/ml) and plasma glucose (approximately 90, approximately 160, approximately 250, and approximately 400 mg/dl) under steady-state and non-steady-state conditions. Under isotopic steady-state conditions, the clearances of tracer and unlabeled glucose across the forearm were identical, and exogenous glucose infusion rates did not differ significantly from the isotopically determined glucose Ra (10.0 +/- 1.3 vs. 10.5 +/- 1.0 mg.kg-1 fat-free mass.min-1, respectively). However, under isotopic non-steady-state conditions, the isotopically determined Ra was significantly lower than the glucose infusion rate (11.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 13.7 +/- 1.5 mg.kg-1 fat-free mass.min-1, respectively, P less than .001), and the underestimation was related to the deviation from the isotopic steady state. When [3H]glucose specific activity of plasma samples from experiments with the greatest underestimation of Ra was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, less than 7% of the underestimation could be accounted for by a contaminant. These results indicate that inadequacy of the one-compartment model is responsible for underestimation of glucose Ra under non-steady-state conditions and that there is no detectable isotopic effect or appreciable contaminant of [3-3H]glucose. We conclude that under isotopic steady-state conditions, [3-3H]glucose is a reliable tracer for glucose kinetic studies in humans.\r"

To elucidate whether these SLI changes are associated with alterations in somatostatin gene transcription, we measured somatostatin mRNA (SmRNA) accumulation in these and other SLI-producing tissues. Pancreas, stomach, jejunum, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex were removed from control rats, 6-wk-diabetic rats, and diabetic rats treated with insulin for 6 wk. Total RNA was isolated by centrifugation through CsCl and fractionated on agarose gels. A sensitive radiodensitometric hybridization assay was used to determine SmRNA levels in absolute amounts by in vitro synthesized sense-strand RNA as a quantitative standard and antisense cRNA as a specific probe. SLI was determined by radioimmunoassay. SmRNA exhibited size heterogeneity between the different control and diabetic tissues. A 2- to 3-fold increase in total SmRNA was found in pancreas and stomach of the diabetic rats that suppressed toward normal with insulin treatment. These two tissues also exhibited significant 1.6- to 2.6-fold increases in SLI, respectively. The remaining tissues showed no diabetes-related changes in SLI or SmRNA. We conclude that in insulinopenic diabetes, tissue SLI and SmRNA accumulation undergo parallel changes; are increased in pancreas and upper gut, reflecting augmented somatostatin synthesis; are reciprocally related to insulin acting directly or indirectly on somatostatin-producing cells; and are unchanged in the lower gut and brain, suggesting tissue-specific regulation of somatostatin gene transcription in diabetes.\r"

These female rats were mated with normal males from the same Sprague-Dawley substrain. In this substrain, the offspring of diabetic rats show a markedly increased congenital malformation rate compared with fetuses of nondiabetic rats. The pregnant diabetic rats were subjected to removal and insertion of pumps at defined gestational days that marked the beginning or end of a 2- or 4-day period of insulin withdrawal. Evaluation of the offspring on day 20 of pregnancy included fetal/placental weights, estimated number of implants, resorptions, and morphological assessment of congenital malformations. Resorptions occurred in all interruption groups, but malformations were found only in animals with insulin withdrawal on gestational days 4-8, 6-8, 6-10, 8-10, and 8-12. The highest resorption (42%) and malformation (17%) rates were found in the rats subjected to insulin withdrawal during gestational days 6-10. Because manifestly diabetic rats with no insulin treatment showed similar resorption (39%) and malformation (17%) rates, this study suggests that a teratogenic period in diabetic rat pregnancy occurs during gestational days 6-10, a period corresponding to postconceptional wk 2-4 in human pregnancy. Interruption of insulin treatment induced similar maternal weight loss and similar maternal serum concentrations of D-glucose, cholesterol, urea, and creatinine in rats with and without malformed offspring.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Past clinical studies have suggested hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia as the factors responsible for these abnormalities, with no reference to the possible effects of low insulin levels. We examine the effect of hypoinsulinemia on rat embryonic growth and development in culture while normal glucose levels are maintained. With anti-insulin antibody bound to an affinity column containing cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B beads, insulin was selectively removed from the homologous culture serum eluted down the column. A culture of rat embryos from the early head-fold stage for 50 h in insulin-depleted normoglycemic homologous serum (insulin levels 0.055-0.18 ng/ml) showed retardation of growth and development when compared with control embryos. Adding physiological amounts (10 ng/ml) of insulin back into the insulin-depleted serum subsequently restored growth level to that of control embryos. We conclude that low insulin levels, encountered in newly diagnosed diabetic pregnancy, may be instrumental in increasing the risk of congenital abnormalities.\r"

Partial remission, defined as good metabolic control (hemoglobin A1c less than or equal to 7.9%, preprandial blood glucose less than or equal to 8 mM with an insulin dose of less than 0.5 U.kg-1.day-1), occurred in 10 placebo (40%) and 7 azathioprine (29%) patients at 6 mo and in 4 placebo (16%) and 4 azathioprine (17%) patients at 12 mo (differences not significant). Fasting plasma C-peptide was significantly greater in the azathioprine-treated group at 3 and 6 mo, but this difference was not sustained. C-peptide responses to a standard meal and the frequency of islet cell and insulin antibodies did not differ between the two groups over the 12-mo period. Azathioprine caused no significant side effects. We conclude that in the dosage used, and despite early effects on endogenous insulin secretion, azathioprine alone does not influence the remission phase in children with newly diagnosed type I diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "To define the sequence of events that is involved in the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we studied 16 NIDDM individuals (15 of 16 Black patients) with a mean age of 44 yr who had been near normoglycemic for 2-91 mo while off of antidiabetic medicine. With the euglycemic insulin clamp at 100 microU/ml insulin, we defined two populations, one with normal peripheral insulin sensitivity (glucose disposal 7.51 +/- 0.97 mg.kg-1.min-1) and the other with insulin resistance (glucose disposal 3.35 +/- 0.58 mg.kg-1.min-1; P less than .001). The populations did not differ in age, degree of obesity, fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, clinical presentation, or clinical course. Basal plasma insulin levels were normal in the sensitive group and significantly elevated in the resistant group. Islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies were absent in all patients. Insulin action on the liver was normal in both groups. Basal hepatic glucose production measured with D-[3-3H]glucose was lower in the insulin-resistant group (1.53 +/- 0.11 mg.kg-1.min-1) than in the insulin-sensitive group (1.88 +/- 0.06 mg.kg-1.min-1) or normal control subjects (1.93 +/- 0.05 mg.kg-1.min-1). The decreased basal hepatic glucose production appeared to be secondary to the twofold higher fasting plasma insulin level seen in the insulin-resistant group. The insulin concentration necessary to suppress basal hepatic glucose production by 50% was 29.6 microU/ml in the insulin-sensitive group and 30.5 microU/ml in the insulin-resistant group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dogs were studied during 150 min of exercise with saline infusion alone (C; n = 6) with the glucagon levels clamped at basal values (somatostatin infusion with basal glucagon replacement and the normal fall in insulin simulated; BG; n = 5) or with the normal exercise-induced rise in glucagon simulated (somatostatin infusion with the rise in glucagon and the fall in insulin simulated; SG; n = 5). Glucose was infused as needed in SG and BG to maintain the glycemic response seen in C. In all dogs, catheters were inserted into the carotid artery and the portal and hepatic veins for blood sampling and the vena cava and the splenic vein for infusions. Glucagon rose from 62 +/- 5 and 57 +/- 4 pg/ml at rest to 104 +/- 20 and 120 +/- 12 pg/ml during exercise in C and SG but did not deviate from basal in BG (56 +/- 3 pg/ml).

This new technique should facilitate the study of the three-dimensional structure of islets of Langerhans.\r"

In the Intermountain Region this oversupply is concentrated in the medical and surgical subspecialties, not in primary care specialties. Students cite fear of not knowing all that a general field requires as a reason for focusing their studies in a narrow area. Because ambulatory care experiences are not required of medical students at Utah, it is difficult to recruit students into the primary care specialties. One means of exposing students to primary care and rural medicine is through the clinical preceptorship. Beginning in 1985, with a grant from the National Library of Medicine, clinical students who elected the rural family practice preceptorship were given lap-top microcomputers to take with them to their preceptorship sites. Students were taught how to operate the computer and how to perform a MEDLINE search. Student evaluations of the experience were high and students reported feeling less concerned about the knowledge explosion and positive about improving their ability to access current medical literature. It is anticipated that by teaching students how to use this technology to provide better patient care, they will be more likely to consider primary care practices in rural areas.\r"

In populations with a low incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, the tumor often arises as a complication of long-standing symptomatic cirrhosis, which may be micronodular or macronodular and which is usually alcoholic in origin, and cirrhosis per se is the major etiologic association of the tumor. The relation between these two pathologic conditions in populations with a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma has not hitherto been analyzed. In this study the association was examined in 463 southern African black men with hepatocellular carcinoma. Cirrhosis, almost always macronodular and rarely showing features of alcholic toxicity, was present in 63.1% of the patients. No differences were found in the age structure, clinical features, hepatic function, serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations, or hepatitis B virus status between patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with and without cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis survived slightly longer, but the difference was not biologically significant. It is concluded that the relation between hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis in southern African blacks differs substantially from that in low incidence regions of the tumor.\r"

After gastrectomy the respective specificities were as follows: pancreolauryl test 10%, bentiromide test 70%, fecal chymotrypsin 70%, and plasma amino acid consumption test 100%. There was no obvious difference in the reduction of specificity between subtotal and total gastrectomy. The respective preoperative to postoperative changes in the median test data were as follows: plasma amino acid consumption test +21%, bentiromide test -12%, fecal chymotrypsin -51%, and pancreolauryl test -53%. It is concluded that after gastrectomy only the plasma amino acid consumption test is unaffected by postoperative anatomic alterations.\r"

However, diuresis has been shown to increase ascitic fluid opsonic activity. Patients with adequate ascitic fluid opsonic activity have been reported to be protected from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In this randomized controlled trial, 19 patients with cirrhotic ascites were treated with diuresis versus daily therapeutic paracenteses during 20 hospitalizations. Serum and ascitic fluid complement concentrations and ascitic fluid opsonic activity were measured at the beginning and end of treatment. Although opsonic activity increased significantly (p less than 0.01) in patients treated with diuresis, this parameter was stable in the paracentesis group. The stability of the ascitic fluid opsonic activity and complement concentration in the paracentesis group were maintained at the expense of a decrease in serum complement, whereas serum and ascitic fluid complement increased in the diuresis group. Diuresis may have the advantage over therapeutic paracentesis of providing better protection from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Study of larger numbers of patients will determine if these changes in complement concentrations and opsonic activity translate into an increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in vivo.\r"

The resected liver was cirrhotic and contained a massive amount of protoporphyrin, with numerous birefringent pigment deposits. Transplantation was accomplished without difficulty following blood volume exchange to reduce the blood protoporphyrin level. Sequential biopsy specimens obtained through the 13th month after transplantation showed no accumulation of protoporphyrin pigment deposits in the new liver. Portal inflammation observed in the liver biopsy specimen at 6 mo after transplantation resolved spontaneously. Erythrocyte and serum protoporphyrin levels returned to values similar to those in the pretransplantation period when the patient had normal hepatic function; the fecal level was lower. Thus orthotopic liver transplantation can be successfully done in patients with protoporphyria who have severe liver disease. Prolonged follow-up is needed to determine the ultimate outcome, however, as the new liver remains susceptible to protoporphyrin-induced damage.\r"

Earlier reports of gastric lymphoma developing in gastric pseudolymphoma and more recent immunohistochemical studies demonstrating monoclonal B-cell populations in pseudolymphoma suggest that at least some cases represent low-grade lymphomas or clonal precursor lesions that may develop into lymphoma. Observations of a small lymphocytic infiltrate arising in the region of a gastric ulcer that lacked definitive morphologic evidence of malignancy (lymphoma) but was clearly a monoclonal B-cell proliferation by immunohistochemical and gene rearrangement studies support the notion that some gastric lymphoproliferative lesions that histologically have been called pseudolymphomas may include one or more clonal lymphoid expansions. A histopathologic/molecular model suggesting a potential pathway for the development of morphologically recognizable lymphoma from benign-appearing small lymphocytic infiltrates is presented, and the concept that for a variety of lymphoid proliferations clonality and malignancy may not be synonymous is discussed.\r"

A dense distribution of sigma binding sites was observed in the mucosa and in the submucosal plexus, particularly at the level of the fundus and duodenum. Muscular layers were only marginally labeled. No phencyclidine binding site could be demonstrated in any area.

No difference in side effects or changes in laboratory parameters were found between the treatment groups except that diarrhea, usually mild, was found more often in the 100-micrograms arbaprostil group (60.0%) than in the 50-micrograms arbaprostil (31.8%) or placebo groups (23.5%) (p value 100 micrograms arbaprostil vs. placebo = 0.02).

The average mean blood pressure increase during the compression periods was 25 mm Hg, but after decompression the blood pressure promptly returned to baseline values. This blood pressure response was constant and did not change over the 9-week period. The blood pressure increase was associated with a significant increase of plasma norepinephrine values. After validity of the model was established, echocardiographic measurements were performed at baseline and after 3, 6, and 9 weeks of compression in six experimental and six time-control dogs. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy was already detectable at 3 weeks, and at the ninth week, the left ventricular mass was 28% above the baseline value. The left ventricular mass in time-control dogs remained unchanged over the same period of time. The time-left ventricular mass curves in experimental dogs were significantly different (by profile analysis), had different means (p less than 0.005), were not parallel (p less than 0.0006), and the overall group difference was highly significant (p less than 0.00001). Since left ventricular hypertrophy, a poor prognostic sign in clinical situations, can evolve before established hypertension, present therapeutic recommendations based on permanently elevated blood pressure values may not be entirely justified.\r"

  ".W": "In normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats stimulation of renal mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors by increasing ureteral pressure or renal pelvic perfusion with 0.9 M NaCl results in a contralateral inhibitory renorenal reflex response with contralateral diuresis and natriuresis. However, in 14-15-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) renal sensory receptor stimulation failed to elicit a contralateral inhibitory renorenal reflex response. The present study was performed to examine whether the lack of a renorenal reflex response in SHR was related to elevated arterial pressure by studying the responses to renal sensory receptor stimulation in 5-6-week-old SHR and in 12-16-week-old SHR that had been treated with captopril from 3 weeks of age to prevent the development of hypertension. In 5-6-week-old SHR, mean arterial pressure was 113 +/- 3 mm Hg. Graded increases of ureteral pressure of 15 and 29 mm Hg resulted in graded increases in ipsilateral afferent renal nerve activity of 57 +/- 22% and 120 +/- 38%. Contralateral urinary sodium excretion increased from 0.26 +/- 0.06 to 0.35 +/- 0.07 mumol/min/g and from 0.36 +/- 0.08 to 0.46 +/- 0.11 mumol/min/g, respectively. In captopril-treated SHR, mean arterial pressure was 109 +/- 3 mm Hg. Increasing ureteral pressure by 34 mm Hg increased ipsilateral afferent renal nerve activity 65 +/- 21% and contralateral urinary sodium excretion from 1.28 +/- 0.24 to 1.53 +/- 0.30 mumol/min/g. Similar results were produced by renal chemoreceptor stimulation. It is concluded that renal sensory receptor stimulation results in a contralateral inhibitory renorenal reflex response in 5-6-week-old SHR and in SHR treated with captopril to prevent the development of hypertension. These results suggest that the previously demonstrated lack of a renorenal reflex response to renal sensory receptor stimulation in hypertensive SHR is related to the maintenance of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Direct effects of dopamine on renin release were examined using static incubations and perifusions of rat renal cortical slices. Dopamine (10(-5)M) significantly stimulated renin release compared with control. To determine which receptors are involved in dopamine-elicited renin release, studies were performed with specific dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 receptor agonists and antagonists, as well as with alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists. Fenoldopam, a dopamine-1 receptor agonist, dose dependently stimulated renin secretion both in static incubations and perifusions; whereas quinpirole (10(-7)-10(-5)M), a dopamine-2 receptor agonist, was ineffective. Phentolamine (10(-4)M), an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, did not alter dopamine- or fenoldopam-induced renin release. Similarly, propranolol, a beta-blocker, did not interfere with the renin stimulation of dopamine (10(-5)M) or fenoldopam (10(-6)M) incubations or perifusion experiments; whereas propranolol significantly blocked isoproterenol action. SCH 23390 (10(-5)M), a specific dopamine-1 antagonist, blocked dopamine- and fenoldopam-induced renin. In contrast, pimozide, a dopamine-2 receptor antagonist, was ineffective. These studies indicate that dopamine is a direct renin secretogogue, and its effects seem to be mediated by specific dopamine-1 receptor activation, as neither alpha- nor beta-adrenergic blockers nor dopamine-2 receptor antagonists altered dopamine actions. The results suggest that dopamine produced locally in the kidney may stimulate renin secretion directly by dopamine-1 receptor activation.\r"

In rabbit aorta, they competitively inhibited the contractile response to angiotensin II with pA2 values of 6.54 and 7.20 and did not alter the response to norepinephrine or KCl. In guinea pig ileum, both agents blocked the responses to angiotensin I and II and did not alter the responses to bradykinin and acetylcholine. A similar specific angiotensin II antagonism was shown in vivo in the spinal pithed rat model. In renal artery-ligated rats, a high renin hypertensive model, EXP6155 and EXP6803 given intravenously, decreased blood pressure with ED30 of 10 and 11 mg/kg, respectively. Both compounds did not alter blood pressure when given orally at 100 mg/kg. Unlike saralasin, EXP6155 and EXP6803 given intravenously did not cause a transient increase in blood pressure in the renal artery-ligated and normotensive rats. Our results indicate that EXP6155 and EXP6803 are selective angiotensin II receptor antagonists and antihypertensive agents. Since neither compound had partial agonist activities or bradykinin potentiation effects, unlike the existing peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, respectively, they may represent preferred probes for studying the physiological roles of angiotensin II.\r"

  ".W": "Modern antihypertensive therapy is enriched by an explosion in drug development that makes available increasingly specific agents whose effects have advanced our understanding of pressor mechanisms. This and other research into hypertensive mechanisms has defined the clinical, pharmacological, and endocrinologic heterogeneity of human hypertension. The sum of these developments is a greatly enhanced ability to identify curable and definable causes of hypertension and to pathophysiologically stratify the remaining cases of essential hypertension. Modern treatment can be much more specific than before. When long-term drug therapy is indicated, the regimen is more likely to achieve a primary goal for each patient, that is, the fewest possible drugs in the smallest amount and in lowest frequency. Two clinically quantifiable mechanisms for long-term arteriolar vasoconstriction can be identified within the spectrum of human hypertension. The first, renin-mediated vasoconstriction, is directly related to the plasma renin level. The second, sodium-volume-related vasoconstriction, is marked by a reciprocally subnormal renin level and involves abnormal sodium retention and calcium transport. A baseline renin-sodium profile can identify the pressure of one of these two forms of vasoconstriction and therefore is the key for the diagnosis of the two curable disorders that fully express one of the two pressor mechanisms--renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Renovascular hypertension, more common than once thought, is often cured by angioplasty. It is important to diagnose these curable forms before beginning long-term drug therapy. The renin-sodium profile, used in conjunction with serum potassium and creatinine measurements, is valuable not only in screening patients for curable forms, but also for stratifying the remainder according to the pathophysiological vasoconstrictor mechanism that underlies the hypertension. Converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers are, by themselves, often effective in correcting the hypertension of high- or medium-renin patients, whereas calcium antagonists, diuretic agents, or alpha-blockers alone are most effective against the low-renin form of vasoconstriction. In the large midzone of renin values, if monotherapy fails, a rational basis for combined antirenin-antisodium volume therapies can be developed.\r"

  ".W": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibiting agents have emerged with the diuretic agents, beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents, and calcium antagonists as therapeutic options for major consideration during the initial treatment of hypertensive patients. These compounds antagonize a potent pressor mechanism underlying hypertensive disease. The ACE inhibitors curtail the generation of the potent octapeptide angiotensin II; in addition, degradation of the potent vasodilator bradykinin is inhibited. Hemodynamically, ACE inhibitors reduce arterial pressure through a decreased total peripheral resistance that is unassociated with reflex stimulation of the heart or expansion of intravascular volume. The arteriolar dilation accounting for the decreased vascular resistance seems to occur in each target organ of the disease. Unlike the direct-acting smooth muscle vasodilators or adrenergic inhibitors, ACE inhibitors dilate the efferent as well as the afferent glomerular arterioles and thereby reduce glomerular hydrostatic pressure and renal filtration fraction, even though renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are preserved. The ACE-inhibiting compounds not only reduce left ventricular afterload in hypertension but also diminish cardiac mass and wall thicknesses. The mechanism(s) for some of these actions have not yet been defined precisely, but they undoubtedly involve the autocrine/paracrine actions of the renopressor system and their effects in the cellular biologic events of vascular smooth muscle and the cardiac myocyte. It seems plausible and exciting that the \"more local\" renin-angiotensin systems will be exploited by those ACE inhibitors yet to be synthesized, which will result in new applications for this class of pharmacological agents.\r"

One relatively new class of agents is the selective alpha 1-inhibitors, which have distinct advantages over earlier nonselective alpha-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents. Three alpha 1-inhibitors are reviewed in this article: prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin. These alpha 1-inhibitors are similar in chemical structure and pharmacological action. alpha 1-Inhibitors lower blood pressure by reducing vascular tone in resistance and capacitance vessels. alpha 1-Inhibitors are similar in effectiveness in blood pressure lowering to other commonly used antihypertensive agents like the thiazide diuretic drugs and beta-blockers, which are efficacious as monotherapy in lowering pressure, as initial agents, or in combination with other antihypertensive agents in multidrug therapeutic regimens. alpha 1-Inhibitors are associated with a reasonably low incidence of serious adverse effects and are essentially free of any adverse metabolic effects. alpha 1-Inhibitors have been shown to beneficially effect blood lipids in several studies. The favorable lipid effect makes alpha 1-inhibitors especially appropriate to use in diabetic hypertensive and other patients with elevated serum lipid levels. The beneficial lipid effects may enhance the ability of alpha 1-inhibitors to prevent coronary heart disease, an outcome that has been difficult to demonstrate in thiazide-based trials.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium channel blockers are recently developed antihypertensive drugs. In terms of mechanisms of action, their specificity is not so well established as that of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors but is better understood than that for diuretics or adrenergic-inhibiting drugs. Calcium channel blockers were originally developed for treatment of angina but were found to lower arterial pressure as well. Three of them are now in wide use in the United States; their therapeutic spectrum in regard to type of hypertension is broad. Sublingual nifedipine has replaced intravenously administered vasodilators as immediate treatment of severe hypertension, and all three drugs, given orally, have been shown to be effective in mild, moderate, and severe hypertension. The three drugs available in this country are verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine. Pharmacological studies have shown that verapamil has the most negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of the three, with nifedipine producing the most vasodilation and having the potential for causing reflex tachycardia. Actually in practice, these various pharmacological differences have proved to have less significance than previously thought, and the drugs seem to have about equal antihypertensive effectiveness. Comparisons of calcium entry blockers with other drugs have shown them to be equally effective in whites as propranolol but more effective in blacks. Responsiveness appears to be related, as well, to pretreatment plasma renin activity and age. Thus, the antihypertensive effect is directly related to age and inversely related to plasma renin activity. The side effects mostly relate to vasodilation, reflex tachycardia, palpitations, headache, and edema; they are not frequent, and the drugs are well tolerated.\r"

Seven trials conducted in study populations with more-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures 100-120 mm Hg or higher), including the more-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, showed large reductions in stroke, other \"hypertensive\" events, and, in one trial, total mortality. Of 11 trials in populations with less-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures predominantly below 105 mm Hg), including the less-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, nine met the criteria for pooling of results. Among the aggregate 43,000 patients in the nine trials who were followed up for an average of 5.6 years, mean diastolic blood pressure reduction was 5.8 mm Hg, and a significant 11% reduction in total mortality was observed. This benefit was largely attributable to a 38% reduction in fatal strokes; nonfatal strokes were similarly reduced. Coronary heart disease mortality was 8% lower in drug treatment than in control groups, but this difference was not significant. A similar result was observed for combined coronary mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction. A possible explanation for the inconclusive result regarding coronary end points was an adverse trend, observed in several trials, in a subgroup with baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities. Because all the trials except the propranolol arm of the Medical Research Council trial used drug regimens based on thiazide-like diuretic agents, and because there are now several new drug classes proposed as initial therapy, additional large-scale clinical trials may need to be considered.\r"

In the absence of an interaction, the multiplicative model of risk implies that the absolute benefit of treatment is related to the underlying risk of an adverse outcome. Thus, each additional risk factor multiplies the absolute benefit of treating hypertension. Analyses of data from subgroups in clinical trials of hypertension treatment suggest that this model is usually valid. In contrast, the adverse effects of treatment are usually unrelated to other risk factors. Thus, the cutoff point for treatment differs in different individuals: setting a single treatment threshold and goal for the entire population is not appropriate. Patients who are at high absolute risk because of prior coronary artery disease or other risk factors have a greater potential absolute benefit, and such patients deserve a low threshold and goal, such as a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg. Conversely, persons at low risk, such as white women without other risk factors, do not require such aggressive management.\r"

Recently, questions have been raised about their relative efficacy in preventing morbidity and mortality from vascular disease in addition to their effect on lowering blood pressure. Attention has been focused on the unfavorable metabolic effects of diuretic drugs and the proven value of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Four randomized controlled trials comparing drugs in these two classes have been published: the Medical Research Council trial, the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial, and the Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertension study. These trials, especially that of the Medical Research Council, have raised some questions about the relative efficacy of these two classes of drugs in preventing stroke in smokers and nonsmokers. Overall, there is little evidence of a reduction in morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction. The predicted advantage of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade over diuretic therapy has not been realized although there are sufficient hints of a differential benefit to encourage the performance of further trials.\r"

Its desired effect is a comfortable and cooperative patient whose pain is alleviated by regional local anesthesia. It requires a patient who understands the difference between being lightly sedated and unconscious. Its primary purpose is to diminish anxiety and apprehension rather than to obtund protective reflexes. At all times, the patient should remain conscious and appropriately responsive to questions or commands. This state can be readily achieved in most patients by carefully titrating a single drug such as diazepam or midazolam to effect. The use of multiple drugs is to be discouraged, since it generally increases the level of sedation and the number of complications. Dosing should be individualized rather than averaged or arbitrary. The end point of titration is the patient's verbal acknowledgement of feeling more relaxed and the physical evidence of such relaxation. The \"Verrill sign\" indicates a level of deep sedation--too deep for most cases of conscious sedation in the office setting. I strongly oppose the routine use of narcotics for office sedation. Monitoring of vital signs before, during, and after surgery ensures the safety of the consciously sedated patient. The use of a pulse oximeter is an evolving standard in general anesthesia and may eventually prove important for patients receiving conscious sedation in the office setting.\r"

  ".W": "The optimal number of times a hollow-fibre cuprammonium rayon (Terumo TAF) dialyzer could be used was determined in twelve patients. Each dialyzer was reused six times. There was a highly significant decrease in neutrophil count (46.9 +/- 6.9%, mean +/- s.e.m.), platelet count (9.6 +/- 3.8%, mean +/- s.e.m.) and serum C3 concentration (10.25 +/- 2.4%, mean +/- s.e.m.) 30 minutes after the commencement of dialysis The intensity of these changes decreased with the re-use of the dialyzers up to the fourth time. There was a small, but significant increase in serum beta 2-microglobulin concentrations after a 6-hour dialysis. The difference between pre- and post-dialysis serum beta 2-microglobulin concentrations appeared to be greater during the 5th and the 6th use (18.8% and 20.5% vs 5.0% during the first use). The clearance rates of urea and creatinine showed a trend to decrease from the fourth use onwards and the ultrafiltration coefficient was significantly reduced from the third use (8.5 +/- 4.0 mean +/- s.e.m.) onwards so that at the sixth use it was only 75.8 +/- 4.8%, (mean +/- s.e.m.) of the value at the first use. It is concluded that the optimal number of uses a cuprammonium rayon hollow-fibre dialyzer can be put to is four.\r"

  ".W": "Leukocyte kinesis in the capillary vascular bed during hemodialysis (HD) was investigated to elucidate the mechanism of transient leukopenia. Leukocyte movement was observed microscopically during HD using the rabbit ear chamber (REC) technique, which permits visualization of the movement of blood corpuscles in capillaries. Blood was drawn from the femoral artery and returned into the auricular and/or carotid artery so that the blood passing through the hollow fiber artificial kidney (HFAK) flowed into capillaries in the REC. Leukocyte counts of blood samples taken from the afferent and efferent limbs of the HD circuit, the right jugular vein and the right atrium were determined consecutively during HD. The difference in the leukocyte count was observed between the afferent and efferent limbs for the first 15 minutes and thereafter between the efferent limb and the jugular vein. The \"transpulmonary\" difference in the leukocyte count was not noticed throughout HD. Between 15 and 90 minutes after the start of HD, scarcely any circulating leukocytes were found in capillaries in the REC and some leukocytes were attached to the endothelial surface. Thereafter circulating leukocytes were seen again and detachment of leukocytes from the endothelial surface was observed. No leukocyte aggregation or embolization of aggregating leukocytes was noticed. This evidence suggests that leukopenia may be attributed to the transient shift of leukocytes to the marginal pool of the vessel lumen and this process may not be specific for the pulmonary vasculature, but may occur in the first capillary bed into which the blood passing through the HFAK flows.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Vasomotor disregulation, preponderantly expressed by a pathological increase of central venous pressure (CVP) in calves with total artificial heart (TAH), starts to be evident from about the 50th day of pumping. The main cause of this state is an imbalance in cardiac receptor areas. Ventricular vasodepressor mechanisms are eliminated with the ventricular tissue, which is replaced by the artificial blood pump. In the stumps of both atria, which remain in situ, all neural elements disappear immediately after TAH implantation, but within two months they are fully regenerated. Regenerated atrial receptors are the starting points of afferent neural stimuli, which in the vasomotor center of the brainstem, increase the activity of the vasoconstricting functional component. A general tendency to vasoconstriction, now not well counterbalanced, increases, and the progressive venous hypertension causes loss of liver function and morphology. Two therapeutic approaches were tried: afferent therapy by atrial electrical stimulation, and efferent therapy by the administration of antihypertensives. Both kinds of this therapy were sufficiently effective in reducing CVP, protecting the liver, and prolonging average survival.\r"

In all, 62% of the rods have expanded after one primary operation. Thirty-four additional operations were necessary; 11 for the correction of rotation or angulation deformities and 23 for revision of the rod or T-piece. All these revisions were successful. Complications were more frequent in children who required very small rods. Problems with Bailey-Dubow rods led to the development of the Sheffield rod system; 17 bones treated with these rods are included in the series. Before surgery only eight of the 24 children were able to walk but at review 20 children were walking, 15 without walking aids. Elongating intramedullary rods should be available to all children with osteogenesis imperfecta as they improve walking capability, reduce the number of fractures, prevent deformity and allow integration of the child into society.\r"

  ".W": "beta-Endorphin and ACTH derive from a common peptide precursor. Although much is known about the physiological patterns of ACTH release, neither the minute to minute regulation of beta-endorphin secretion nor its temporal relationship to cortisol has been characterized. As an initial step to defining the regulation of beta-endorphin release in man, we studied the circadian periodicity, ultradian rhythmicity, and episodic pulsatility of serum beta-endorphin concentrations in seven normal men. Blood sampling was conducted at 10-min intervals for 24 h, and the subsequent serum samples were assayed by a two-site immunoradiometric assay. Computerized analysis of the subsequent beta-endorphin time series revealed a mean beta-endorphin pulse frequency of 13 +/- 1 (+/- SE) peaks/24 h, corresponding to an interpulse interval of 100 +/- 7 min. The mean maximal peak height of beta-endorphin pulses was 31 +/- 3 pg/mL (9.0 +/- 0.8 pmol/L), which represented an incremental increase of 11 +/- 1 pg/mL 3.2 +/- 0.4 pmol/L; 63 +/- 13%) above the preceding nadir. The average beta-endorphin peak exhibited a duration of 68 +/- 6 min. Fourier analysis revealed a significant circadian amplitude of 6 +/- 1 pg/mL (1.6 +/- 0.4 pmol/L; 23% of the 24-h mean concentration), with an acrophase (time of maximum value) at 1043 h (+/- 40 min). Spectral analysis also disclosed beta-endorphin rhythms with mean periodicities of 29 +/- 4, 42 +/- 4, and 61 +/- 5 min. Gel filtration chromatography confirmed that serum beta-endorphin peaks contained significantly more immunoactive beta-endorphin [62 pg/mL (18 pmol/L)] than did the flanking nadirs [16 and 18 pg/mL (4.6 and 5.2 pmol/L)]. Auto- and cross-correlation analyses of serum beta-endorphin and cortisol concentrations followed by autoregressive modeling disclosed that all seven men had significant positive cross-correlations between serum beta-endorphin and cortisol considered simultaneously or when cortisol lagged beta-endorphin by 10 min. A negative cross-correlation was found in five of the seven men when cortisol was considered to lead beta-endorphin by 20 or 30 minutes. We conclude that beta-endorphin is released physiologically in a pulsatile manner with circadian and ultradian rhythmicity and a close temporal coupling to cortisol.\r"

Chromatofocusing across a pH 9-6 gradient of the medium in which fetal pituitary cells had been grown yielded at least eight distinct peaks of LH immunoreactivity. The more basic LH peaks bound more strongly to Concanavalin-A-Sepharose than did the more acidic ones, suggesting that the more basic LH molecules contain more hybrid oligosaccharides, in which one antenna terminates in a mannose, and that the more acidic human LH molecules contain more complex oligosaccharides, in which both antennae terminate in negatively charged groups, sialic acid and/or N-acetylgalactosamine-sulfate. The biological/immunological activity (B/I) ratios of the secreted LH varied directly and dramatically with the pI, from 8.1 at pI 8.4 to 1.1 at pI 6.3. Secreted LH, therefore, exhibits similar heterogeneity of glycosylated forms as does stored LH, raising the possibility that the hormones that control overall LH secretion could affect the secretion of some isohormones more than others and thereby influence LH biological activity to a degree not predicted by measuring total LH immunoreactivity.\r"

The basal plasma amino acid levels were similar in both groups. The postprandial increase in the plasma amino acid levels in the obese subjects was only 15-50% of that in the lean subjects. The mean basal and peak postprandial plasma insulin levels were significantly higher (72 and 165 pmol/L) in the obese group than in the lean group (36 and 115 pmol/L; P less than 0.05-0.01). The postprandial rise in plasma glucagon was largely attenuated in the obese subjects, and there was no difference in plasma PP and glucose levels in the 2 groups. To further evaluate the role of circulating amino acids on pancreatic endocrine function in obese and lean subjects, an amino acid mixture consisting of 15 amino acids was infused iv. During the infusion the plasma amino acid levels were comparable in both groups. Plasma insulin rose by 36 +/- 7 (+/- SE) pmol/L (5 +/- 1 microU/mL) in the lean and 129 +/- 22 pmol/L (18 +/- 3 microU/mL) in the obese subjects, whereas plasma glucagon, PP, and glucose levels were similar in both groups. In view of the 3.6-fold greater insulin responses in the obese subjects, it is likely that circulating amino acids contribute to their hyperinsulinemia in spite of the reduced postprandial rise of amino acids in this group (50-85%). Thus, under physiological conditions amino acids have to be considered as an important regulatory component of postprandial insulin release in obese subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Glucagon and epinephrine are the most important short term glucose counterregulatory hormones. The epinephrine response in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is related to the level of glycemic control, but little is known about the factors influencing counterregulation in normal subjects. We, therefore, conducted hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp studies to examine the counterregulatory response to recurrent and prolonged mild hypoglycemia in normal women. Blood glucose was clamped for 20 min at 3.5 mmol/L. Thereafter, the subjects had their blood glucose maintained at 2.8 mmol/L for 90 min and on another occasion lowered to 2.8 mmol/L and raised to 3.5 mmol/L twice during the 90-min period. Continuous hypoglycemia produced augmented plasma glucagon, cortisol, and pancreatic polypeptide responses (all P less than 0.05) compared to these responses to recurrent hypoglycemia. Plasma GH increased, but the magnitude of the response was not altered by the duration of hypoglycemia. During the recurrent hypoglycemia study plasma epinephrine levels rose and fell in parallel with the fluctuations in blood glucose. The mean peak increase was similar [1.37 +/- 0.25 (+/- SE) nmol/L] to that during the continuous study (1.76 +/- 0.23 nmol/L). There was no change in plasma glucagon levels in response to hypoglycemia of less than 15-min duration. We conclude that 1) the duration of hypoglycemia influences the counterregulatory response, and 2) epinephrine release is under precise control and responds rapidly to fluctuations in blood glucose.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine the effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1) on human thyroid epithelial cells (thyrocytes) and whether thyrocytes produce IL-1. The supernatants of cultured peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into thyrocytes from normal subjects and patients with Grave's disease. The IL-1 levels of cultured supernatants of monocytes were measured by a thymocyte costimulation assay and a solid phase sandwich immunoenzymometric assay. The supernatants of monocyte cultures stimulated with LPS contained significant amounts of IL-1 bioactivity and IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta immunoactivity. Recombinant IL-1 beta (rIL-1 beta) also stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into thyrocytes from normal subjects and patients with Graves' disease, and it increased the proportion of thyrocytes in the S phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, thyrocytes stimulated with rIL-1 beta for 24 h produced significant amounts of prostaglandin E2. Indomethacin inhibited completely the rIL-1 beta-stimulated prostaglandin E2 production and increased markedly [3H]thymidine incorporation. IL-1-like activity also was detected in the cultured supernatants of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated thyrocytes from Graves' and normal thyroid glands, but the amount of IL-1-like activity secreted by thyrocytes was significantly less than that secreted by circulating monocytes. The kinetics of the release of IL-1-like activity by thyrocytes were similar to those of its production by circulating monocytes. Pretreatment of thyrocytes with interferon-gamma failed to enhance the release of IL-1-like activity. Moreover, IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta immunoreactivity could not be detected in the supernatants of LPS-stimulated thyrocytes, despite the presence of IL-1-like bioactivity. No IL-1 alpha mRNA was detected in unstimulated thyrocytes or thyrocytes stimulated with LPS and phorbol myristate acid. These findings demonstrate that thyrocytes produce an IL-1-like substance(s), but not IL-1, when stimulated by LPS. We conclude that IL-1 may regulate the proliferation of thyrocytes and that local production of IL-1 by infiltrating monocytes may contribute to the development of goiter in patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases.\r"

Serum PRL levels declined to normal in 41 women, 30 of whom received 0.2-1 mg cabergoline once weekly, 8 received 0.2-0.5 mg twice weekly, and 3 received 0.4-0.6 mg 3 times weekly. Five women had slightly supranormal serum PRL levels while receiving 0.3-0.6 mg once weekly, but the dose was not increased because the lower dose had produced the desired clinical benefit. Two women had 50% reductions in their serum PRL levels, but remained hyperprolactinemic while receiving 2-3 mg cabergoline weekly. Among 30 amenorrheic women, 28 had resumption of menses, the exceptions being 2 hypopituitary women, presumptive evidence of ovulation was available in 21. Marked tumor shrinkage occurred after 3-month treatment in 5 of the 6 women who had macroprolactinomas. Only 4 women had side-effects during the first weeks of treatment, and these vanished despite continued cabergoline administration at the same or reduced, but still effective, doses. In a short term, double blind study, cabergoline at 3 different schedules (0.4 mg twice weekly, 0.2 mg 4 times weekly, and 0.4 mg 3 times weekly for 3 weeks, followed by 0.4 mg twice weekly) or placebo was given to a total of 24 hyperprolactinemic women (6 in each subgroup) for 8 weeks, with weekly evaluation of serum PRL levels and side-effects. All 3 cabergoline schedules, but not placebo, induced significant reductions in serum PRL concentrations during the 8-week treatment period. Mild transient side-effects occurred in 7 drug-treated patients (nausea in 5; dizziness in 3). We conclude that cabergoline is effective treatment for hyperprolactinemia. Its efficacy, tolerability, and long duration of action may make it the drug of choice for patients with hyperprolactinemia.\r"

The CD18 heterodimer involved in this adherence was evaluated in vitro using subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The adherence of unstimulated neutrophils to IL-1-stimulated HUVEC was significantly inhibited by anti-CD11a but not CD11b MAbs, while the adherence of fMLP-stimulated neutrophils was significantly inhibited by both anti-CD11a and -CD11b. Anti-CD11a, but not anti-CD11b MAbs, reduced the adherence of unstimulated neutrophils on purified ICAM-1 to the same low level untreated neutrophils exhibited on a control protein, glycophorin. Stimulation with fMLP significantly increased neutrophil attachment to purified ICAM-1, but not to the control protein. Anti-CD11b MAbs reduced this chemotactically augmented adherence to that of unstimulated neutrophils, and in combination with anti-CD11a MAbs reduced adherence to that on the control protein. The results in this report indicate that unstimulated neutrophils exhibit LFA-1-dependent attachment to ICAM-1, and chemotactic stimulation enhances the attachment of human neutrophils to ICAM-1 by a Mac-1-dependent process.\r"

Results suggest that staphylococcal adherence is dependent on both the substrate and the material used to coat these fibers. Scanning electron micrographs supported the adherence results and revealed more cells on the surface of cotton than rayon fibers. Treatment of staphylococcal cells with proteolytic enzymes significantly reduced binding to pure cotton and detergent-treated cotton fibers. Immunoblot analysis of cell wall proteins suggested that surface proteins in the mol wt range of 120-220 kD were involved in the adherence of S. aureus to cotton fibers. Although the adherence of S. aureus to cotton fibers alone appeared to be mediated through surface charge or hydrophobic interactions, bacterial binding to fibers which have been pretreated with defibrinated blood appeared to be more specific and independent of the surface constituents of the fibers. The results of these studies implicate staphylococcal surface proteins in the adherence of S. aureus to commercially available tampon fibers and surgical gauze pads.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to define the source of renin biosynthesis within the human uteroplacental unit and to characterize the renin produced. RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis consistently demonstrated renin mRNA expression in uterine lining both in the pregnant (decidua) and nonpregnant states (endometrium) and in fetal chorion laeve, which is inseparable from the decidua. In contrast, renin mRNA expression was not detected in basal plate and intertwin chorion (which is separate from decidua), amnion, myometrium, or placental villi. The total renin content in decidual homogenates was two- to threefold greater than in endometrial homogenates, and cultured human decidual cells produced significantly more total renin than cultured human endometrial cells, suggesting that pregnancy enhanced renin production by the cells lining the uterus. Immunoblot analysis and [3H]leucine incorporation identified 47,000-mol wt prorenin as the major form of renin produced by cultured human decidual cells. These studies indicate that maternal decidua is the major source of prorenin in the uteroplacental unit.\r"

In this study, groups of mice were immunized with Gal-Gal pili and challenged 2 wk later intravesicularly with E. coli strains expressing homologous or heterologous pili. 63 of 129 pili-immunized mice (49%) were protected from subsequent E. coli renal colonization compared with 5 of 85 control mice (6%). Among mice that had E. coli cultured from their right kidney, control mice had greater bacterial colony counts than pili-immunized animals (P less than 0.05). Light microscopic examination of kidneys demonstrated less histopathology among pili immunized mice than among control mice (P less than 0.05). Protection correlated with the presence of specific IgG antibodies in the urine and serum that bind to the major pilin structural polypeptide and not to the Gal-Gal pili tip adhesin per se. These results support the concept that immunization with a bacterial surface-coat constituent can prevent mucosal infection by interfering with colonization. Also Gal-Gal pili of E. coli represent a suitable candidate for immunoprophylaxis against pyelonephritis.\r"

The study of pathologic cardiovascular ontogeny is equally in need of new insight and fresh approaches. Although all clinicians might agree that genes are important contributors to both the etiology and the pathogenesis of congenital heart defects, with the exception of a few Mendelian conditions, this knowledge cannot be put to practice beyond crude statements of empirically determined probabilities. In this review, we selectively examine studies that are addressing what we perceive as provocative issues and suggest some areas, such as chaos theory, in which new ideas might be found.\r"

Angiograms from 118 patients, representative of the 4.9% of medically treated Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) patients who during subsequent 3 year follow-up study had an anterior myocardial infarction, were matched on the basis of arteriographic anatomy and disease with 141 patients who did not have an anterior infarction. Angiograms from these 259 patients with 557 left anterior descending artery stenoses were reviewed without knowledge of clinical outcome. Conditional regression analyses were performed to determine the importance of stenosis morphology, relative to computer-determined stenosis severity and other clinical variables, in the prediction of risk of infarction. Univariate analysis revealed luminal roughness (odds ratio 4.5; p = 0.001) and lesion length (odds ratio 1.7 per unit length; p = 0.007) to be highly correlated with future risk of infarction. Multivariate analysis revealed left anterior descending artery percent stenosis greater than or equal to 50%, lesion roughness, left circumflex artery stenosis and smoking, in that order, to be predictive of anterior myocardial infarction, whereas 22 other morphologic variables were not independently predictive of outcome. The importance of stenosis roughness may relate to its propensity for thrombogenesis and should be considered in clinical decision making.\r"

The mean pressure gradients derived by color-guided continuous wave Doppler ultrasound correlated well with those obtained at catheterization for both the tissue and mechanical mitral and aortic prostheses (r = 0.85 to 0.87). For the effective prosthetic orifice areas, better correlation with catheterization results were obtained with the tissue mitral (r = 0.94) and tissue aortic (r = 0.87) prostheses than with the mechanical mitral (r = 0.79) and mechanical aortic (r = 0.76) prostheses. The maximal width of the color flow signals at their origin from the tissue mitral prostheses also correlated well with the effective prosthetic orifice area at catheterization (r = 0.81). Doppler color flow mapping identified prosthetic valvular regurgitation with a sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 100%, respectively, for the mitral and 92% and 83% for the aortic prostheses. There was complete agreement between the Doppler color flow mapping and angiographic grading of the severity of prosthetic valvular regurgitation in 90% of mitral and 73.5% of the aortic regurgitant prostheses with under- or overestimation by greater than 1 grade in only two cases. Valvular and paravalvular regurgitation was correctly categorized by Doppler color flow mapping in relation to the surgical findings in 94% of the mitral and 80.5% of the aortic prostheses.\r"

Synthesized by cardiac fibroblasts, these fibrillar collagens support and tether myocytes to maintain their alignment, whereas their respective tensile strength and resilience resist the deformation, maintain the shape and thickness, prevent the rupture and contribute to the passive and active stiffness of the myocardium. An acquired or congenital defect in this collagen network can lead to abnormalities in myocardial architecture, mechanics or valve function. In the hypertrophic process that accompanies a pressure overload, for example, increased collagen synthesis, fibroblast proliferation and a structural and biochemical remodeling of the matrix are seen. This includes distinctive patterns of reparative and reactive myocardial fibrosis, each of which alters diastolic and systolic myocardial stiffness and may lead to pathologic hypertrophy. Alternatively, a loss of collagen tethers or decline in matrix tensile strength can be responsible for regional or global transformations in myocardial architecture and function seen in the reperfused (\"stunned\") myocardium and in dilated (idiopathic) cardiopathy. Inherited disorders in the transcriptional and posttranslational processing of collagen can also alter the biophysical properties of the network. Future studies into collagen gene regulation, gene switching events and the control of collagen synthesis and degradation are needed to develop a more complete understanding of the relation between the collagen network and acquired and inherited forms of heart disease and to utilize therapeutics that will prevent, retard or regress abnormal collagen matrix remodeling.\r"

  ".U": "89256361\r", 
  ".W": "The explosion of costly new medical diagnostic technologies demands a common sense approach to help physicians decide appropriate indications and strategies for use of these tests. This simple, nonmathematical review focuses on the assessment of coronary artery disease, but the approach can be generalized to other medical problems. This clinical approach to diagnostic testing strategies is based on seven sequential questions: 1. What is the clinical probability that this patient has a specific disease characteristic based on clinical data? 2. What is the overall objective for management of this patient based on the overall status of the patient? 3. Most importantly, what specific questions need to be answered about the patient's condition before the physician can recommend the most appropriate management (e.g., whether the patient has coronary disease, whether an anatomic lesion is functionally significant, whether a myocardial region is reversibly ischemic or irreversibly infarcted, whether a particular therapy has had good or bad effects or what is the patient's prognosis)? The key point is for the physician to formulate a specific clinical question about the patient before the test. 4. The physician must then ask how well does the test answer the particular clinical question about the patient. Here the physician needs to understand the sensitivity and specificity of the test, especially because they are influenced by various clinical biases. 5. Next, the physician must ask how to interpret the reliability of a positive or negative test result in the individual patient. This requires understanding predictive value and predictive error of a given result and how they are influenced by the clinical data as described by Bayes' theorem. 6. Next, the physician must ask what further tests or therapies will be recommended for the patient. The physician can estimate in advance how different test results would alter management plans and he can then allow this estimate to help determine indications for the test. There is some controversy concerning whether to use Bayes' theorem or multivariate analysis to estimate the final probability of a disease characteristic. 7. Finally, in this era of quality assurance, professional review and cost containment, it behooves each physician to ask whether the data provided by the particular tests were worth the cost, inconvenience and risk for that particular patient.\r"

  ".W": "To study the biochemistry of processing of a soluble protein Ag by an APC, we investigated how 125I-labeled human insulin (HI) is processed in situ by TA3 mouse hybridoma B cells. Fractionation of TA3 cells into their extracellular, plasma membrane-associated and intracellular compartments coupled with the use of HPLC enabled us to analyze several peptides derived from each compartment. One HI peptide found in all three compartments is composed of residues A1-A14 disulfide-linked to B7-B26 (A1-A14/B7-B26). The presence of this peptide in the extracellular compartment likely resulted from digestion of HI by an enzyme(s) released from the APC. Extracellular processing of radiolabeled HI was inhibited completely by unlabeled HI and N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of a previously described insulin-specific protease, partially by lysozyme but not by BSA or OVA. This suggests that the enzyme involved in the extracellular processing of insulin is relatively insulin-specific and gives rise to the A1-A14/B7-B26 peptide. The processing of HI both at the plasma membrane and intracellularly was inhibited by chloroquine, monensin, and NH4Cl, suggesting that both intracellular pH changes and endocytic and exocytic events may be required for these compartments to process insulin. Kinetic analyses revealed that the processing of insulin into the A1-A14/B7-B26 peptide is first detected at the plasma membrane then intracellularly and finally in the extracellular compartment. This unlabeled A1-A14/B7-B26 peptide was purified from the extracellular compartment of TA3 APC by HPLC; when presented by TA3 APC this peptide effectively stimulated pork insulin (PI/I-Ad) specific Th cells to secrete IL-2. These data, taken together with the identification of another processed insulin peptide, A7-A11/B7-B26, have enabled us to elucidate the first steps in the biochemical pathway(s) of processing of insulin as an Ag in a B cell APC.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of certain Gram-negative bacteria and host HLA class I Ag to the development of reactive arthritis (ReA)3 has strong epidemiologic support but the pathogenesis of the arthritis is unknown. An outbreak of Salmonella typhimurium afforded the opportunity to compare the immune response to the organism between those who developed ReA (ReA+, n = 11) with those who did not (ReA-, n = 12). Of the 11 ReA+ patients, 4 were B27-positive and 6 were B7-positive; of the ReA- patients none was B27- or B7-positive. The causative pathogen S. typhimurium phage 22 was used to examine PBL proliferation by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Impairment in lymphocyte response to S. typhimurium in ReA+ compared with ReA- was demonstrated by: i) lower stimulation index (1.9 +/- 0.3 for ReA+, 5.7 +/- 0.6 for ReA-, p less than 0.01); ii) lower in vitro Ig production; and iii) lower Ag-induced IL-2 production. Mixing experiments did not demonstrate a soluble suppressor factor in ReA+ supernatants. Thus, after infection with S. typhimurium there is an impairment in cellular immunity that has correlates in immunogenetic and clinical features of the infected population.\r"

  ".W": "We recently described the induction of an inflammatory myopathy in SJL/J mice after injection of skeletal muscle Ag and adjuvant that is characterized by necrosis of muscle fibers associated with infiltrating mononuclear cells. In the present study, an immunohistologic analysis was performed to examine the phenotype of these infiltrating cells and to determine changes in cell-surface Ag expression in involved muscle. The predominant cells infiltrating muscle after induction of experimental autoimmune myositis (EAM) were found to be Mac-1+/I-A+ macrophages, representing 80 to 90% of all infiltrating cells, and CD4+ T lymphocytes, representing 10 to 15% of all infiltrating cells. Few CD8+ T cells, and no B cells, were seen in the involved muscles. Interestingly, endothelial cells in involved muscles were also noted to express class II MHC Ag. Aberrant I-A Ag expression was not observed on endothelial cells in other tissues examined, including kidney, liver, cardiac muscle, and lung. I-A Ag expression appeared to correlate with susceptibility to disease in that muscle endothelial cells remained negative after attempts to induce EAM in a nonsusceptible strain. Together, the data suggest that aberrant organ-specific class II MHC Ag expression and a response by CD4+ T cells may be pathogenetically involved in the muscle injury of EAM. In addition, the predominance of infiltrating macrophages suggests that these recruited cells may also be important in the immune-mediated muscle damage.\r"

Using nonadherent low density T lymphocyte depleted (NALT-) BM cells cultured in the presence or absence of IL-1, CSF-deprivation studies demonstrated that IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta by itself did not enhance the proliferation of CFU-GM or BFU-E. They did, however, promote the survival of progenitors responding to the delayed addition of media conditioned by the 5637 cell line (5637 conditioned medium), rhu GM-CSF and erythropoietin. The survival promoting effects of IL-1 alpha on CFU-GM and BFU-E were neutralized by anti-IL-1 alpha mAb added to the cultures. The survival promoting effect of IL-1 alpha did not appear to be mediated by CSF, because neither CSF nor erythroid burst promoting activity were detectable in cultures in which NALT- cells were incubated with rhuIL-1 alpha. In addition, suboptimal concentrations of rhu macrophage CSF (CSF-1), G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3, which were just below the levels that would stimulate colony formation, did not enhance progenitor cell survival. Survival of CFU-GM and BFU-E in low density (LD) bone marrow cells did not decrease as drastically as that in NALT- BM cells, and exogenously added IL-1 did not enhance progenitor cell survival of CFU-GM and BFU-E in LD BM cells. However, addition of anti-IL-1 beta decreased survival of CFU-GM and BFU-E in LD BM cells. These results implicate IL-1 in the prolonged survival of human CFU-GM and BFU-E.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the bactericidal activity of two proteins that are abundant in the cytoplasmic granules of human eosinophils, major basic protein (MBP) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). Unlike the human neutrophil's peptide defensins, both MBP and ECP killed stationary phase Staphylococcus aureus 502A in a simple nutrient-free buffer solution. Although MBP also killed Escherichia coli ML-35 with considerable efficacy under these experimental conditions, the in vitro activity of ECP against E. coli was considerably enhanced if mid-logarithmic phase bacteria replaced stationary phase organisms or if the assay medium was enriched with trypticase soy broth. The antibacterial activity of both eosinophil proteins was modulated by incubation time, protein concentration, temperature and pH. A pBR322-transformed derivative of E. coli ML-35 was used to examine the effects of ECP and MBP on integrity of the bacterial inner membrane (IM) and outer membrane. Although both MBP and ECP caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization when nutrients were present, only MBP was effective under nutrient-free conditions. Two proton ionophores (DNP and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone) protected E. coli from the bactericidal effects of ECP but not from MBP. These findings establish that MBP and ECP have bactericidal properties and suggest that these proteins kill E. coli by similar but nonidentical mechanisms marked by an attack on the target cell's membranes. In view of evidence that high concentrations of ECP and MBP exist in cytoplasmic granules whose contents are translocated to phagocytic vacuoles, we suggest that MBP and ECP contribute to the eosinophil's ability to kill ingested bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that multimeric C9 within C5b-9 (C9:C5b-8 greater than 3:1) is needed for killing of a rough strain of Escherichia coli. We now extend these studies using serum sensitive, rough (R) and serum resistant, wild type (WT) strains of Salmonella typhimurium as well as a mutant S. typhimurium strain (TS) with a temperature sensitive mutation in synthesis of keto-deoxy-octulosonate, a constituent within the deep core structure of Salmonella LPS. Both R and TS required multimeric C9 within C5b-9 to be killed. Addition at 37 degrees C of increasing inputs of C9 to TS or R bearing C5b-9 led to a dose-related increase in C9 binding and killing. In contrast, addition of high inputs of C9 to the same strains at 4 degrees C, a procedure that limits the C9:C5b-8 ratio to 1:1, resulted in low C9 binding and minimal killing. Bactericidal C5b-9 formed at 37 degrees C on R and TS with high inputs of C9 co-sedimented with the bacterial outer membrane on sucrose density gradient analysis. Non-bactericidal C5b-9 on R, WT, and TS co-sedimented near the inner membrane, despite the presumed lack of association between these constituents. Whereas 125I C9 within the non-bactericidal pools immunoprecipitate with anti-C5, 125I C9 within bactericidal pools did not immunoprecipitate with anti-C5, anti-C7, or anti-C9. These findings suggest that bactericidal C5b-9 may be deposited in a unique location or configuration within the bacterial cell wall.\r"

  ".W": "We have mapped and determined the gene order of five cloned genes in the vicinity of the murine host resistance gene Bcg on mouse chromosome 1. For this, we have used a RFLP-type analysis in panels of 43 recombinant inbred strains, 3 congenic mouse strains, and 186 segregating backcross progeny derived from inbred strains of Bcgr and Bcgs genotypes. The Bcg alleles of segregating animals were established by in vivo infection with Mycobacterium bovis (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) strain Montreal. Genomic DNA prepared from progenitor mouse strains was isolated, digested with restriction endonucleases, and analyzed by Southern blotting to identify strain-specific RFLP for each DNA marker tested. Among a number of DNA markers tested, Len2, Fn, Vil, Alpi, and Achrg were found to co-segregate with Bcg in mouse strains congenic for this locus. Detailed segregation analysis of the five markers and Bcg showed that Vil was extremely close to Bcg with no recombinant identified, whereas Fn and Len2 were located 4.5 and 9 cM proximal of Bcg, respectively. Alpi and Achrg mapped 5 and 5.5 cM distal from Bcg, respectively. Pedigree analysis in the recombinant inbred strains and backcross animals indicated the gene order: centromere-Len2-Fn-Vil,Bcg-Alpi-Achrg. The tightly linked Vil marker can now be used as an entry point in recombinant genomic DNA libraries to clone sequences overlapping Bcg. This group of five genes flanking Bcg on mouse chromosome 1 is precisely conserved on the telomeric end of the long arm of human chromosome 2q. Our results suggest that a likely location for a putative human homologue to the murine host resistance gene Bcg is the long arm of human chromosome 2 (2q32-qter).\r"

Currently, no technique exists by which the very early changes in psoriasis can be investigated. We report a method in which plaques of psoriasis are serially traced to identify their advancing edge. Eight-two untreated plaques from 15 patients and 38 treated plaques from 6 patients were traced over a three-week period; 65% of untreated and 57% of treated plaques showed consistent asymmetrical movement, allowing identification of an active and an inactive edge of each plaque. Using this technique, the active edge of two or more plaques was identified in each of ten patients. Blood flow measured by laser Doppler flowmetry indicated a 2.5-to-4.5-fold increase in cutaneous blood flow at the active edge compared with the inactive edge of each plaque. Punch biopsies from the sites investigated by laser Doppler flowmetry were examined by routine histology and monoclonal antibody immunohistology, but revealed no epidermal change and no T lymphocytic excess when the two areas were compared. We infer from these findings that the earliest change in a developing plaque is an increased blood flow, probably associated with a diffusable, and possibly humoral, initiating factor that accumulates at the active edge, stimulating transformation of normal skin to psoriatic plaque.\r"

Significant protein was found in the squamous cell layer of the surface epidermis, in squamous cell carcinomas, in the external root sheath of hair follicles, and in eccrine gland secretory cells; it was poorly expressed in the basal cell layer and in a basal cell carcinomas. Increased neu expression appears to be associated with the differentiation of keratinocytes.\r"

Psoriasis is a hyperproliferative epidermal disease in which EGF receptor expression is altered and phospholipase C activity is increased. Considering the potential importance of growth factor stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism in the genesis of abnormal growth, we measured PI kinase activity in epidermal keratome biopsies from normal skin and the lesional and nonlesional skin of psoriatic patients. The PI kinase activity in 10 psoriatic involved plaques was increased 6.7-fold (Vmax = 67.1 +/- 23.9 pmol formed/min/mg protein +/- SE) when compared with 11 normal epidermal biopsies (Vmax = 10.0 +/- 1.3 pmol/min/mg protein, p less than 0.025). Similar results were noted when enzyme activity was standardized using DNA content. The apparent Km of PI kinase for ATP in involved psoriatic biopsies (0.45 +/- 0.14 mM) was also significantly (p less than 0.025) increased compared with normals (0.11 +/- 0.02 mM). The PI kinase activity in 11 biopsies of nonlesional psoriatic epidermis was not statistically different from normal epidermis. Both psoriatic and normal PI kinases required Mg++ and were inhibited by Ca++. The polyamine, spermine, a known activator of PI kinase in other tissues, stimulated normal but not psoriatic epidermal PI kinase. Both normal and psoriatic PI kinase activities had an apparent mol wt of 85,000. Increased synthesis of phosphoinositides by PI kinase in psoriatic tissue may provide more substrate for phospholipase C; a key enzyme in growth factor-mediated signal transduction.\r"

Interleukin 1 alpha and beta immunoreactive species were detected by Western blot analysis only when epidermal extracts were obtained in extraction buffers containing dithiothreitol (DTT), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), or 2 mercaptoethanol. Together with the 31-kD (intracellular precursor molecule) and the 17-kD (mature, secreted form) species, most of the antisera and MoAb reacted with a protein of 52-kD that was not found in several internal organs, and from which a 31-kD form could be released upon reelectrophoresis. Interleukin 1 beta immunoreactivity was consistently found by immunohistology at the level of the stratum granulosum, where IL-1 alpha immunoreactivity, although less consistently, also localized. Several monoclonal antibodies to IL-1 beta reacted intensively and specifically with epidermal basal cells. At the electron microscopical level, IL-1 beta immunoreactivity was detected in the upper layers of the stratum granulosum; it appeared to be membrane associated and suggested an exocytosis process similar to that involving lamellar bodies. These observations 1) confirm the presence of IL-1 species in the normal unstimulated human epidermis, 2) show that both IL-1 alpha and beta are detectable herein, 3) identify 52-kD IL-1 alpha and beta immunoreactive bands that appear special to the epidermis, and 4) suggest a link between epidermal IL-1 and the differentiation process of the keratinocyte.\r"

  ".W": "A murine anti-human monoclonal antibody (19-DEJ-1) has been produced that binds to basement membranes (BMs) of the dermoepidermal junction and arrector pili muscles but not to either dermal glandular or vascular BMs. 19-DEJ-1 also recognizes BMs underneath epithelia of buccal mucosa, tongue, esophagus, cervix, and cornea, and BMs surrounding smooth muscle in medium-sized vessels, placenta, uterus, and esophagus. When 16 human fetal skins (aged 54-142 gestational days) were examined, the antigen was first detected at 81 days. Using immunoperoxidase and immunogold staining techniques, indirect immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated localization of 19-DEJ-1 to the level of the midlamina lucida, directly underneath hemidesmosomes; absent staining was noted beneath melanocytes. 19-DEJ-1 antigen was detectable in unfixed A431 cells grown on coverslips. After radioincorporation of 35S-methionine into A431 cells, 19-DEJ-1 monoclonal antibody specifically precipitated 2.75% of the total radiolabeled proteoglycans produced in culture supernatant and isolated by anion exchange chromatography. On the basis of our present findings, we conclude that 19-DEJ-1 monoclonal antibody defines a unique primate-specific proteoglycan that is present within BMs along the epithelial-connective tissue interface and around smooth muscle in skin and other selected organs. Its unique ultrastructural localization suggests the possibility that 19-DEJ-1 may recognize an antigenic epitope of either anchoring filaments or alternatively, the subbasal dense plate.\r"

Aeromonas, Campylobacter jejuni, E. coli manifesting localized adherence to HEp-2 cells and enterotoxigenic E. coli were significantly associated with acute diarrhea. E. coli strains that exhibit aggregative adherence, so-called enteroaggregative E. coli, a newly-described category of diarrheagenic E. coli distinct from enterotoxigenic, enteroinvasive, enterohemorrhagic, and enteropathogenic E. coli, were found significantly more often in patients with persistent diarrhea (29.5%) than with acute diarrhea (12.8%) (P = .0052) or controls (9.9%) (P = .0006).\r"

Progressively increasing the dose of antibiotic in this experimental catheter-associated urinary tract infection model first eliminated the bacterial population adherent to the bladder mucosa and then the planktonic population in the urine. The bacterial biofilm on the Foley catheter could be eradicated only by the highest dose of antibiotic (400 mg/kg). Scanning electron microscopy showed a gradual deterioration of bacterial biofilm and reduction in bacterial numbers with increasing antibiotic dosages. These data suggest that antibiotics used in short-term catheterization may reduce the serious sequelae associated with catheter-related infections by clearing the potentially dangerous bladder mucosal bacterial populations and urine planktonic bacteria.\r"

The role of antibiotics in acute nonperforative appendicitis (NPA) remains unclear. In 175 patients studied at two hospitals, preoperative guidelines were used to exclude perforative appendicitis. Nevertheless, 14% of patients were found to have this condition. Surgeon's reports significantly underestimated the diagnosis when compared with the pathologists' reports. Antibiotic prophylaxis in 122 patients with NPA was studied prospectively comparing ceftizoxime (CTZ), cefamandole (CFM), and placebo (PLA). Ceftizoxime decreased the infection rate compared with PLA (0 vs. 8; P less than .01). Use of antibiotics (CTZ or CFM) resulted in decreased infections when compared with PLA (3 vs. 8; P less than .01) and fewer days of hospitalization (3.8 vs. 5.4 d, P less than .005). Analysis of infection risk factors showed no correlations except for failure to administer antibiotics and the finding of a gangrenous appendix. Operative culture results had no predictive value for either infection or pathogen identification. It is recommended that all patients undergoing surgery for NPA be given 1 d of antibiotic prophylaxis.\r"

By days 5-8 after infection, a mixed polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cellular infiltrate was observed in the submucosa and mucosa. Epithelial cell deterioration occurred in the endosalpinx in areas of heavy mononuclear cellular infiltration. During the acute phase of the disease a cellular infiltrate consisting mainly of T cells was identified by staining frozen tissue sections with monoclonal antibodies to mouse lymphocyte antigens. Occasionally B lymphocytes were observed. Widespread deciliation of the mucosa was observed by scanning electron microscopy. No histopathologic or immunopathologic responses were observed in the control oviducts. These observations suggest an immunologic basis for the structural abnormalities seen in the infected oviducts.\r"

Felodipine ER did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin when given as a single dose or at steady state compared with placebo. At steady state the felodipine plain tablet resulted in an 11% increase (P less than 0.05) in peak plasma concentrations of digoxin. Systolic time intervals as noninvasively measured haemodynamic parameters were not significantly altered following the felodipine ER period, while the felodipine plain tablet significantly decreased the pre-ejection/left ventricular ejection time ratio compared to placebo.\r"

At the onset of the study the mean IGF-I level, 127 +/- 15 ng ml-1, was significantly decreased (P less than 0.001) in comparison with age-matched controls, whereas the mean IGF-II level, 1024 +/- 48 ng ml-1, was increased. A significant correlation (r = 0.70, P less than 0.05) was found between IGF-II and HbA1c levels. The mean morning level of IGFBP, 75 +/- 17 ng ml-1, at the onset of the study, was increased threefold above that in age-matched controls (P less than 0.01). There was a significant correlation between IGFBP and blood glucose values (r = 0.66, P less than 0.05). During CSII therapy a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) of the IGFBP levels was seen in subjects with a decrease in glucose levels, whereas no change was observed in IGF levels. The findings of elevated IGF-II and IGFBP levels and correlations between IGFBP and blood glucose concentration as well as IGF-II and HbA1c levels in adolescents with IDDM indicate that both IGF-II and IGFBP reflect a deranged metabolism caused by inadequate insulin administration.\r"

Extensive microbiological tests were performed to detect pathogenic organisms in the vagina and cervix. Gardnerella vaginalis was associated with findings of clue cells, gray or creamy vaginal discharge, amine ordor on application of potassium hydroxide solution to the discharge, pH greater than 5, and a history of more than six sexual partners. Candida albicans was associated with the presence of pseudohyphae or budding yeast on microscopic examination and the lack of clue cells. Current use of oral contraceptives and the recent use of antibiotics were not predictive of a Candida albicans infection. Trichomonas vaginalis was more common in patients presenting with symptoms, but otherwise was not predicted by the factors tested.\r"

All records of documented Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia (46 cases) at Alachua General Hospital, Gainesville, Florida, over the period July 14, 1982, through July 27, 1985, were reviewed in detail. Fifty-nine percent (27 organisms) were nosocomial, whereas 41% (19 organisms) were community acquired. The most common predisposing disorders in these patients were, in decreasing order, malignancy; following gastrointestinal or biliary surgery; biliary tract obstruction; diabetes; and unknown. Twenty-two percent (10) of the patients died from bacteremia. The majority of organisms tested were sensitive to mezlocillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, tetracycline, tobramycin, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and ceftizoxime. Therapy was considered to be appropriate in 89% (41) of the patients and inappropriate in 10.9% (5) of the patients. Contrary to previous thought, Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia is a relatively common problem in the community hospital and may be community acquired as well as nosocomial. There are many characteristics of this disease in the community that are different from those reported in studies on Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia from large referral centers.\r"

Forty-seven pregnancies (8.3%) had an adverse outcome. There was a clear relationship between risk score and probability of adverse outcome. Good sensitivity could be achieved only at the expense of a very high false-positive rate, however. The index can be used to identify a subgroup of women at relatively high risk for adverse outcome, but the majority of adverse outcomes will occur in women identified as low risk. The risk-scoring system in this population was no more effective than a policy that would refer all women with standard obstetric risk factors.\r"

Bites to a site where joints or bones are close to the skin are especially prone to severe complications. Bites to the hand, therefore, require meticulous radiographic and surgical evaluation if a puncture or a severe laceration has occurred. Since the normal human oral flora harbors more pathogens than that of animals, human bites have a higher incidence of serious infections and complications. The oral flora of both humans and animals is anaerobic-aerobic, and initial empiric treatment requires the most broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy available, in addition to scrupulous wound management and, when required, immunization against rabies and tetanus.\r"

Routine monitoring of expired tidal volume should be used whenever PEEP is added to an anesthesia circuit.\r"

Experiments were developed which demonstrate that the model can represent common clinical situations. The model depicts physical devices as ideal resistors, pressure sources, and flow sources. The patient's venous system is depicted as a combination of ordinary and Starling resistors. For flows between 0 and 300 ml/hr, both physical devices and patients are adequately represented by a straight line representing the pressure-flow relationship (PFR): pressure = opening pressure + flow X resistance, where the slope is the resistance to fluid flow and the intercept is the opening pressure. The PFR for a normal vein is characterized by a flat slope (vein resistance = 22 +/- 20 mm Hg/L/hr, mean +/- SD) and a low intercept (opening pressure = 15 +/- 8 mm Hg). The PFR for a partially obstructed vein has a resistance equal to that of an unobstructed vein and an opening pressure elevated approximately equal to the pressure obstructing the vein. For perivascular tissue, the PFR has a steep slope (tissue resistance = 1,125 +/- 1,376 mm Hg/L/hr), while tissue opening pressure depends on the amount of fluid infused. At the onset of fluid extravasation (infiltration), tissue pressure usually is lower than venous pressure (8 +/- 8 versus 15 +/- 8 mm Hg), until fluid fills the distensible tissue compartment. In clinical practice, when infiltration or obstruction occurs, flow decreases and the clinician adjusts the roller clamp until correct flow resumes; no problem is obvious. The combined model for the intravenous tubing and venous systems explains the behavior of current clinical infusion devices.\r"

Pulse rates were unchanged on both the electrocardiograph and pulse oximeter. Electromagnetic interference was excluded as the cause of desaturation. A great deal of energy was emitted by the hand-held light in the 660-nm region, which is one of the wavelengths used by the oximeter. False readings of pulse rate and SaO2 values caused by ambient light could be avoided if oximeter probes were manufactured of black opaque material that does not transmit light or enclosed in an opaque plastic housing.\r"

When the mass is displaced and then released, there results a characteristic motion called simple harmonic motion. The full description of this motion requires defining the concepts of undamped and damped natural frequency, as well as of damping itself. Once these concepts are defined and the mass-spring system clearly understood, their relevance to recording blood pressure measurement by fluid-filled catheters is explained. The apparent paradox of how damping can affect undamped natural frequency is clarified. Finally, impedance matching is explained in the context of how some damping devices work. Detailed mathematical proofs are relegated to an appendix.\r"

  ".W": "We postulated that the fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) required to achieve a certain value of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) can be used as an indicator of pulmonary gas exchange impairment in patients during mechanical ventilation. We tested this hypothesis in 20 patients. By reducing FIO2 in increments of 10 vol% of capacity while monitoring SaO2 with pulse oximetry, we could determine FI98, FI97, FI96, and FI95; that is, the FIO2 that yields 98, 97, 96, and 95% SaO2, respectively. On the basis of our data, we chose FI98 as the most appropriate index, as an SaO2 of 97% or below could not be achieved even with a low FIO2 in some of the patients. To test the significance of the newly proposed index, we compared FI98 with the alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference, P(A - a)O2, and with the respiratory index, which are routinely used elsewhere. The correlation between FI98 and P(A - a)O2 was excellent: P(A - a)O2 = 490.5 * FI98 + 117.2 with a correlation coefficient of 0.906 (P less than 0.01). FI98 also correlated significantly with the respiratory index: respiratory index = 4.354 * FI98 - 0.776 (r = 0.889, P less than 0.01). We conclude that FI98 may be used as a simple index for the rough estimation of pulmonary gas exchange impairment without the need for invasive procedures. However, further studies are needed to confirm the validity of our method in hemodynamically unstable patients or when other brands of pulse oximeters are used.\r"

SETTING: Outpatient medical clinic of a large city hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-eight women were initially screened. Trial selection was based on a history of recurrent PMS symptoms and on the results of a prospective assessment of daily symptom scores. Only women with symptom scores during the late luteal phase that were at least 50% greater than those during the intermenstrual phase were selected. Thirty-three women completed the trial. INTERVENTION: A preliminary evaluation included physical examination, routine laboratory tests, dietary assessment, and psychiatric evaluation. Each participant received six months of treatment involving three months of daily calcium supplementation (1,000 mg of calcium carbonate) and three months of placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy was assessed prospectively by changes in daily symptom scores over a six-month period and retrospectively by an overall global assessment. Multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance on symptom ratings derived from daily PMS symptom scores demonstrated a reduction in symptoms on calcium treatment during both the luteal (p = 0.011) and the menstrual phases (p = 0.032) of the reproductive cycle. Calcium supplementation had no effect during the intermenstrual phase. Retrospective assessment of overall symptoms confirmed this reduction: 73% of the women reported fewer symptoms during the treatment phase on calcium, 15% preferred placebo, and 12% had no clear preference. Three premenstrual factors (negative affect [p = 0.045]; water retention [p = 0.003]; pain [p = 0.036]) and one menstrual factor (pain [p = 0.02]) were significantly alleviated by calcium. CONCLUSION: Calcium supplementation is a simple and effective treatment for premenstrual syndrome, but further studies will be needed to determine its precise role in PMS.\r"

PATIENTS: 253 unselected patients hospitalized between January 1985 and December 1987 given principal discharge diagnoses of urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, or gram-negative rod bacteremia originating in the urinary tract. RESULTS: Three clinically distinct groups were identified: women under 50 years old, older women, and men. Escherichia coli was isolated from 93% of young women, 70% of older women, and 46% of men. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 39% of men with one or more urinary tract risk factors, including recent or recurrent urinary tract infections and known genitourinary tract abnormality. The overall prevalence of Group D streptococci was only 1%. More than 20% of the patients in each group were bacteremic. In all groups, resistance to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins was common. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was active in 98% of young women and 85% of older women and men without urinary risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Age and gender identify clinically important subgroups of patients with serious urinary tract infections. Pending culture results, all patients should be considered bacteremic, ampicillin alone should not be prescribed, and antibiotics effective against P. aeruginosa should be given to men, especially those with risk factors.\r"

DESIGN: All English-language studies reporting mortality or survival from screening proctosigmoidoscopy published since 1960 were critically reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Fifteen references reported on five studies of screening proctosigmoidoscopy. Two authors independently reviewed each reference using explicit methodologic criteria, particularly for potential sources of bias. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the five studies, four used historical controls and were susceptible to bias, especially self-selection and lead-time bias. Only the Kaiser-Permanente Multiphasic Health Check-up study collected a representative patient sample from a defined population, had randomly allocated controls, and avoided multiple sources of bias. There was a reduction in mortality from a group of seven potentially postponable causes of mortality, including colorectal cancer, although no difference in overall mortality between screened and control groups was found. This study was not designed to determine specifically the impact of screening proctosigmoidoscopy on mortality from colorectal cancer, and suggested that most of the reduction in colorectal cancer deaths was due to a lower incidence in the screened group, which could not be attributed to polypectomy. The benefit of screening proctosigmoidoscopy in this study, if any, was small. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence in the literature is inadequate to determine whether or not screening proctosigmoidoscopy has an impact on colorectal cancer mortality, but the best available data suggest that the benefit is small, at best.\r"

Groups created to compare the different variables were assessed at 30 and 90 days postoperatively by macroscopic and histologic methods, microangiography, and mechanical strength testing. Without repair, all excisional defects of the disc failed to heal. Suturing of the reapproximated margins did not appear to promote healing or provide much strength beyond the properties of the suture material. Dermal grafts, fixed by suturing, induced healing by becoming incorporated into the disc, restoring discal continuity, and approximating normal disc strength. The use of laser-assisted tissue welding for dermal graft fixation was found to be inadequate and was subsequently abandoned. Fascial grafts could be fixed into position by both suture and laser-assistance, but consistently failed to exhibit successful transplantation and promote healing at the disc site.\r"

The role of ASC in understanding shamanic phenomena, the roots of religious experience, and the modern manifestations of the potential for trance are examined. Western cultural avoidance of ASC has inhibited understanding of these phenomena, and has prevented an integration of shamanistic and trance perspectives into the understanding human of psychology, consciousness, and knowledge of the world.\r"

Carl Jung displayed all five of these features in his life and psychotherapy, including dreams and waking fantasies in childhood; the use of active imagination in the induction of an ASC; contact with forces, knowledge, and power of the unconscious; a dual \"personality,\" and the dialogue with the inner world--the unconscious, the realm of the archetypes; the use of these discoveries to counsel, advise, and heal; and psychic abilities, such as clairvoyance and out-of-body experiences.\r"

The decline in the utilization of these substances is linked to social reactions, which led to psychedelics being scheduled as controlled substances and consequently unavailable for human research. Three different paradigms for the use of psychedelics in psychiatry are reviewed: the psychotomimetic, the psycholytic, and the psychedelic approaches. The psychotomimetic paradigm, which viewed hallucinogens as agents for temporarily inducing psychoses, proved to be of limited value to the understanding and treatment of mental illness. The psycholytic approach, which was derived from the psychoanalytic paradigm, is a technique employing low doses of psychedelic drugs to reduce psychological defenses and to release unconscious information. The high-dose psychedelic paradigm frequently produced reports of mystical or spiritual experiences, thus recasting the psychiatrist as the modern-day shaman. This paradigm has alienated many in the psychiatric profession and has led to a reaction against the use of psychedelics in psychotherapy. If the opportunity should arise to pursue sanctioned clinical research with these unique psychoactive substances, however, it will be imperative to learn from the traditional models of shamanic healers in order to optimally assess true clinical efficacy and safety.\r"

The psychophysiological literature on different types of trances and on seizure conditions associated with the temporal lobe discharge syndrome is reviewed. On this basis, it is hypothesized that while both the SSC and possession trances involve hippocampal-septal stimulation, the difference between the SSC and the possession states includes the amygdala involvement associated with the latter. This criterion and others establish a basis for differentiating between the terms \"shamanic,\" \"shamanistic,\" and \"mediumistic.\" The physiological concomitants of the SSC make it appear to be both physiologically and psychologically beneficial as well as indicating that it is most likely that there is a genetic component affecting one's ability to enter the SSC and other ASC.\r"

It is argued that the problems of validity and reliability of trance experiences for scientific discourse are in principle no different than the problems associated with ordinary perception. The shift in early Greek philosophy from myth to an emphasis on logos (reason) has led to a neglect of those subtle qualities of reason that were considered to be gateways for divine revelation. Scientific methodologies cannot account for such revelation, and there are no criteria known to science that would enable people to utilize these phenomena. Shamanic experiences are intersubjectively accessible and provide data that is suitable for the construction of rational theories if appropriate methodologies are developed. However, for a scientist, shamanic experiences are considered at most to be psychological ones, and consequently without any value for empirical research. This article examines the possibility of reevaluating the terms \"rational\" and \"consciousness,\" in order to expand scientific methodologies in such a way that volitionally altered perceptions of reality can be integrated into scientific research.\r"

  ".W": "Contemporary reference to the role of water lilies and mandrakes (Nymphaea and Mandragora, respectively) in ancient Egyptian healing, and subsequent research on the iconography of the water lily in Mayan shamanistic ritual, suggest the possible importance of these plants as adjuncts to shamanistic healing in dynastic Egypt. Although the usual interpretation of the water lily and the mandrake has been that of a part of ritual mourning, the present article revises this notion. Based on an extensive review of these two powerful narcotic (i.e., hypnotic) plants in iconography and ritual, it is argued that the dynastic Egyptians had developed a form of shamanistic trance induced by these two plants and used it in medicine as well as healing rituals. Analysis of the ritual and sacred iconography of dynastic Egypt, as seen on stelae, in magical papyri, and on vessels, indicates that these people possessed a profound knowledge of plant lore and altered states of consciousness. The abundant data indicate that the shamanistic priest, who was highly placed in the stratified society, guided the souls of the living and dead, provided for the transmutation of souls into other bodies and the personification of plants as possessed by human spirits, as well as performing other shamanistic activities.\r"

The article includes an overview of the preparation and application of ayahuasca, the symbolic adaptations to the process of social change, the role of singing, the perceptive mode during the visionary state, and the structure of the visions. It is noted that the healing activities provide the entire community access to transcendental experiences, which clearly have integrative and cohesive social functions. Ethnopsychology provides important insights into the functions of archaic healing rituals, and can be used to illustrate the transcendental experiences and pathological use of drugs in modern societies.\r"

Classifications range from narrow and highly specific to broad and inclusive coverage. Some restrict the usage to traditional societies, while others seek applications to Western phenomena, whether faith healers and mediums, or poets, such as Walt Whitman. The concept of control, with a variety of meanings assigned to it, emerges as a significant variable in the comparative study of \"trance\" and \"shamanism\" as these terms are used by different authors in widely different manners.\r"

  ".W": "With two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound, we demonstrated high-output cardiac failure in three fetuses with large sacrococcygeal teratomas. All fetuses had normal cardiac structure, dilated ventricles maintaining a normal fractional shortening index, a dilated inferior vena cava reflecting the increased venous return from the lower body, pericardial and pleural effusions as a manifestation of fetal hydrops, and a markedly thickened placenta. When fetal hydrops was present, the combined ventricular output was very high (mean 1280 ml/min/kg; normal 553 +/- 153 (SD)). Descending aortic flow was also sharply increased (mean 930 ml/min/kg; normal 184 +/- 20), as was placental flow (mean 480 ml/min/kg, normal 110 +/- 26). High-velocity arterial flow signals were also found within the tumor. In one fetus studied serially, placental thickness and tumor diameter increased rapidly; placental flow as a percentage of descending aortic flow decreased, indicating a further increase of flow to the tumor. These abnormal hemodynamic changes were reversed after the fetus's teratoma was surgically removed. We conclude that the sacrococcygeal teratoma acts as a large arteriovenous fistula, which causes high-output cardiac failure. Surgical removal of the teratoma in a previable fetus with such hemodynamic findings may prove to be the most effective treatment.\r"

Neutrophil counts were interpreted according to a widely employed reference range. Infants with conditions other than IVH reported to be associated with neutropenia (sepsis, maternal hypertension, 5-minute Apgar score less than or equal to 5) were excluded. Final study groups included 38 infants with IVH and 114 without IVH. No significant differences were found for birth weight, gestational age, respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, prolonged rupture of membranes, patent ductus arteriosus, route of delivery, pneumothorax, or sex. The occurrence of neutropenia before 14 days of age was not significantly different between the groups (50% with IVH, 56% without IVH), nor were differences found at individual postnatal ages. Comparison of immature neutrophil count and immature/total neutrophil ratio also revealed no differences. The high incidence of neutropenia in our non-IVH group raises questions about application of these widely accepted reference ranges to very low birth weight infants.\r"

SETTING: Office- and hospital-based pediatric practices. PATIENTS: Seventy-two children between 1 and 12 years of age entered the study. One child was withdrawn because of high fever, and three children did not complete the study; 31 received placebo and 37 received acetaminophen. INTERVENTIONS: Acetaminophen, 10 mg/kg/dose, was given at 8 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM, and 8 PM for 4 days. Placebo was given to the control group. Itching, appetite, activity, and overall condition were measured for 6 days. The time to last vesicle formation, time to total scabbing, and time to total healing were measured until complete resolution of the exanthem. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The following results were better in the placebo group (p less than .05): time to total scabbing 5.6 days (SD 2.5) versus 6.7 days (SD 2.3) in the acetaminophen group, and itching on day 4 in the placebo group (symptom score 2.9 (SD 0.20) vs 2.2 (SD 0.26]. Activity was better in the acetaminophen group on day 2 (3.13 (SD 0.23) vs 2.82 (SD 0.24].

After 24 hours of therapy, routine cerebrospinal fluid cultures for all patients treated with ceftriaxone were sterile, whereas 9% of cerebrospinal fluid cultures were positive in cefuroxime-treated patients (p less than 0.001). More cefuroxime-treated patients had abnormal physical examinations at the time of discharge than did ceftriaxone-treated patients (39/159 vs 25/174, p = 0.02). At 6-week and 1-year follow-up examinations, there was no longer a statistically significant difference in the incidence of neurologic abnormalities between the two therapy groups, but the incidence of hearing impairment in one or both ears was higher in the cefuroxime (18%) than in the ceftriaxone (11%) treatment group. Both regimens are efficacious for the treatment of bacterial meningitis, but some patients may not respond as satisfactorily to cefuroxime as to ceftriaxone.\r"

  ".W": "We carried out a preliminary study to determine whether intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy could be safely and effectively used in the treatment of childhood lupus nephritis. Sixteen children (4 to 18 years of age) with lupus nephritis were treated with cyclophosphamide monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months. Eight children were treated because of corticosteroid-unresponsive active lupus nephritis, with a fall in their creatinine clearance to less than 100 ml/min/1.75 m2, and eight children were treated because of corticosteroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome or active lupus nephritis with unacceptable corticosteroid-induced side effects. Cyclophosphamide treatment was associated with significant improvement at 1 year in mean levels of hemoglobin (11.3 +/- 0.5 to 13.1 +/- 0.3 gm/dl), C3 (52 +/- 5.9 to 108 +/- 13.7 mg/dl), and C4 (7.6 +/- 0.9 to 15.9 +/- 2.2 mg/dl) (all p less than 0.005), despite a significant reduction in mean prednisone dosage (31 +/- 5 to 14 +/- 2 mg/day; p less than 0.005). There was a decrease in 24-hour urine protein excretion from 3121 +/- 913 to 1016 +/- 364 mg/24 hours (p less than 0.05). For children whose initial creatinine clearance was less than 100 ml/min/1.75 m2, creatinine clearance also improved significantly (57.5 +/- 11 to 121 +/- 24.5 ml/min/1.75 m2; p less than 0.05). The long-term safety of intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy and its long-term efficacy in comparison with prednisone alone remain to be established. In the interim, intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy should be reserved for children with severe, unacceptable corticosteroid side effects or with corticosteroid-resistant and potentially life-threatening disease.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested that insulin action is reduced during puberty in normal children. To determine whether such resistance leads to excessive insulin secretion, we used the hyperglycemic clamp technique to produce a standard hyperglycemic stimulus (125 mg/dl above fasting levels for 120 minutes) in 9 preadolescent and 14 adolescent healthy children and in 14 normal adults. Fasting plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations were higher in adolescents than in preadolescents and adults (p less than or equal to 0.02). Despite identical glucose increments during the glucose clamp procedure, both first- and second-phase plasma insulin and C-peptide responses were also markedly greater in adolescents than in preadolescents or adults (p less than 0.01 vs. other groups). Despite sharply increased insulin responses in adolescents, the amount of exogenous glucose required to maintain hyperglycemia was similar in all three groups. Insulin responses in the children were directly correlated with fasting plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor I (r = 0.60 to 0.70, p less than 0.01). We conclude that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is normally increased during puberty, a response that may compensate for puberty-induced defects in insulin sensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) are subject to recurrent and severe infections due to organisms known to cause red blood cell membrane modifications. These red cell modifications include the exposure of novel carbohydrate cryptantigens that can react with naturally occurring antibodies and potentially result in hemolysis. We examined the frequency of cryptantigen exposure on the surface of red cells from AIDS/ARC patients. Blood samples from 108 patients with AIDS/ARC and from 65 non-AIDS/ARC patients were tested for most common forms of cryptantigens. The lectin Arachis hypogaea agglutinated red cells from 7% (8/108) of the AIDS/ARC patients and 3% (2/65) of non-AIDS/ARC patients, indicating the presence of T, Tk, or Th cryptantigen exposure. One sample from an AIDS patient with E. coli sepsis had T activation with polyagglutinable red cells. None of the samples showed evidence of exposed Tn or acquired B antigens. These results show that red cell cryptantigen exposure does occur in AIDS patients with a prevalence similar to that previously reported in patients with sepsis or malignancy. For this reason, and because polyagglutination has been associated with in vivo hemolysis, cryptantigen exposure should be considered in the differential diagnosis in AIDS patients with suspected immune hemolysis; it can be tested for by performing a minor crossmatch with ABO compatible serum.\r"

  ".U": "89258313\r", 
  ".W": "The literature is briefly summarized as to how several nutrients affect immune function, susceptibility to infection, and cancer susceptibility or progression. Nutritional deficiencies can impair immunity and so influence susceptibility to infectious agents, including ones that are common and relatively virulent in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. A variety of nutrients affect several of the immune functions that are defective in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. For example, beta-carotene increased the number of CD4+ cells; vitamin E decreased the number of CD8+ cells and increased the CD4+/CD8+ ratio; vitamin D decreased the CD4+/CD8+ ratio; and iron increased the number of peripheral lymphocytes in humans receiving supplementation. Furthermore, nutritional deficiencies can influence gastrointestinal function, while infectious diseases can influence nutrient requirements by altering the efficiency of absorption and the rate of tissue metabolism. Malnutrition, depressed serum zinc levels, and intestinal nutrient malabsorption have been found in AIDS patients. The above findings suggest that dietary manipulations might diminish the immune defects in HIV infection and enhance resistance to opportunistic infections. However, dietary alterations in immune defects are generally not well quantified and may be small relative to the magnitude of the defects observed in AIDS patients. Because conflicting or adverse effects have been reported for some nutrients, recommendations for dietary supplementation in HIV-infected individuals are premature and possibly hazardous. Further studies are much needed to relate dietary nutrient intakes to clinical outcomes.\r"

Site-directed mutagenesis was used to localize regions important for Rev function. We found that proteins with single amino acid substitution mutations concentrated within the amino termini and midportion of Rev were for the most part nonfunctional. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that Rev was localized predominantly in the nucleolus. However, a deletion mutant that lacked the basic stretch of amino acids comprising residues Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Trp accumulated in the cytoplasm and was no longer functional. Consistent with this observation, a beta-galactosidase fusion protein containing this basic rich peptide at its amino termini was targeted to the nucleus. These observations indicate that the HIV rev protein has a distinct nuclear localization sequence and suggest that Rev-mediated regulation of gene expression involves nuclear events.\r"

These compounds completely protected MT-4 cells against HIV-1-induced cytopathogenicity at a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml, whereas no toxicity for the host cells was observed at 200 micrograms/ml. They also inhibited HIV-1 antigen expression in HIV-1-infected CEM cells. The bile acids (cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid) did not show any inhibitory effect on HIV-1 replication at concentrations that were not toxic to the host (MT-4) cells. From a structure-function analysis of a number of cholic acid derivatives, the presence of either a sulfonate (as in the tauro conjugates) or a sulfate group as well as the \"litho\" configuration appeared to be necessary for the expression of anti-HIV-1 activity. The active cholic acid derivatives did not directly inactivate the virus particles at the concentrations that were not toxic to the host cells. Lithocholic acid 3-sulfate, taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate, and glycolithocholic acid 3-sulfate, but not taurolithocholic acid, partially inhibited virus adsorption to MT-4 cells. These three compounds were also inhibitory to the reverse transcriptase activity associated with HIV-1.\r"

Before chronic morphine administration, all drugs produced dose-dependent decreases in response rates. After daily administration of up to 56 mg/kg of morphine for 7 weeks, dose-effect curves for the mu agonists morphine and l-methadone, as well as the mu/kappa agonist ethylketazocine shifted to the right approximately 1 1/4, 3/4 and 1/2 log units, respectively. In contrast, dose-effect curves for the mixed agonist/antagonists cyclazocine and bremazocine each shifted to the left approximately 3/4 log unit, whereas dose-effect curves for the kappa agonist U50,488 and the nonopioid chlorpromazine did not shift during chronic morphine administration. Dose-effect curves for all drugs except bremazocine returned to their prechronic positions within the period 3 to 8 weeks after termination of chronic morphine administration. The present study demonstrates that repeated administration of morphine produces tolerance to its rate-decreasing effects as well as cross-tolerance selective to other opioids possessing mu agonist properties. The cross-tolerance to ethylketazocine observed in morphine-tolerant pigeons corroborates studies of the discriminative stimulus effects of ethylketazocine in pigeons, suggesting that in this species ethylketazocine possesses predominantly mu agonist properties.\r"

  ".W": "Pigeons were trained to discriminate a dose of either 0.01 mg/kg of bremazocine or 0.05 mg/kg of fentanyl from water using a two-key drug discrimination procedure. During tests of substitution, the selective kappa-opioid agonists bremazocine, U50, 488 and tifluadom substituted for the bremazocine stimulus, whereas the less selective kappa-opioid agonists ethylketocyclazocine, levallorphan, proxorphan and nalorphine substituted for the fentanyl stimulus. The full mu-opioid agonists fentanyl, morphine, I-methadone and levorphanol, as well as the partial agonists nalbuphine, butorphanol and buprenorphine, substituted for the fentanyl stimulus. Compounds with partial-opioid agonist effects, namely nalbuphine, butorphanol, buprenorphine, proxorphan, levallorphan and nalorphine, produced 50% fentanyl-appropriate responding at doses 25 to 369.2 times smaller than the doses required to decrease response rates to 50% of control values. In contrast, the full mu-opioid agonists fentanyl, morphine, I-methadone and levorphanol produced 50% fentanyl-appropriate responding at doses only 1.3 to 10.9 times smaller than those required to decrease response rates by 50%. During tests of antagonism, both naloxone and Mr2266 produced a dose-dependent attenuation of the stimulus effects of bremazocine and fentanyl, whereas beta-funaltrexamine antagonized the stimulus effects of fentanyl but not bremazocine. Although bremazocine has been reported to have mu-opioid antagonist effects, it failed to antagonize the stimulus effects of the training dose of fentanyl. The present investigation establishes further that pigeons can discriminate selective kappa-opioid agonists from mu-opioid agonists and that in pigeons the classification of numerous opioid compounds on the basis of their kappa-like or mu-like stimulus effects differ from those in rat and monkey. In addition, under the drug discrimination procedure the actions of compounds classified as partial-opioid agonists can be differentiated from those of full mu-opioid agonists on the basis of the ratio of the dose required to engender fentanyl-like stimulus effects to the dose required to reduce response rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although insulin is known to elicit a positive inotropic effect in cardiac muscle preparations, very little is known concerning the mechanism of this action. In view of the crucial role played by the sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) calcium transport in cardiac contractile events, the effects of insulin on the pig heart SR were investigated. Insulin activated the SR Ca++-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1 mU to 1 U/ml); maximal activation (125%) was seen at 0.1 to 1 U/ml of insulin. Kinetic studies revealed that the insulin-induced activation was due to an increase in the apparent Vmax of Ca++-stimulated ATPase without any alteration in the Km. Insulin was found to bind with SR membranes in a specific manner and this binding was rapid, saturable and displacable. The dose-related increase in the activation of Ca++-stimulated ATPase was related linearly (r = 0.98) to binding of insulin with SR membranes; 50% activation of Ca++-stimulated ATPase was found to occur at 13.5 fmol of insulin binding per mg of SR protein. When insulin was allowed to dissociate by a 100-fold dilution of the insulin-receptor complex, the activity of SR Ca++-stimulated ATPase also declined gradually. Furthermore, proteolytic digestion on the membrane with trypsin (3 micrograms/mg of protein) decreased both insulin binding as well as the increase in Ca++-stimulated ATPase activity by about 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Women between 20 and 35 weeks' gestation who successfully completed a course of intravenous tocolysis were eligible for inclusion. One hundred two patients were randomized to oral ritodrine (20 mg every four hours) or oral terbutaline (5 mg every four hours). The groups showed no significant differences with respect to recognized risk factors for preterm labor or prognostic factors for the failure of tocolysis. Initial treatment failures occurred more frequently in the ritodrine group (nine vs. two, P = .0527). There were no statistically significant differences in the treatment results or frequency of side effects. We conclude that ritodrine appears to be less effective than terbutaline upon the initiation of oral therapy and that oral ritodrine and terbutaline are equivalent in safety and efficacy when used on a long-term basis for preventing recurrent preterm labor.\r"

Fibroblasts in monolayer culture and in situ in synovial tissue were PH positive, whereas freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells and granulocytes were PH negative. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 37 +/- 3 (22-56)% of all DNA synthesizing cells in situ were PH containing fibroblasts, whereas all DNA synthesizing cells in patients with meniscus lesion were PH positive. In both conditions, more than half of the self-replicating fibroblasts were located in the lining cell layer. This is probably not an artifact caused by insufficient penetration of 3H-thymidine because most of the DNA synthesizing lymphocytes were deep down in the synovial stroma. In RA 51 +/- 8 (17-88) PH positive fibroblasts in the S phase of the cell cycle were observed/3 mm2 synovial tissue, whereas the corresponding figure in meniscus patients was only 1 +/- 1 (0-5) (p less than 0.01). This suggests that the local fibroblasts in RA are activated, probably as a result of various fibroblast growth factors produced locally as a result of the inflammatory synovitis. In RA however, less than 1% of all local fibroblasts were self-replicating in situ, whereas labeling indices over 5% were not uncommon in RA synovial fibroblast cultures. This finding suggests that uncontrolled fibroblast proliferation is regulated in vivo by negative feedback mechanisms.\r"

Different characteristics, including age, sex, primary tumor site, type of surgery (complete resection vs. partial resection or biopsy), and preoperative levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were analyzed to evaluate their association with risk of subsequent local malignant recurrence. After a median follow-up of 6 years, 21 patients are alive with no recurrence of the tumor (72% event-free survival). One patient died from infection after surgery and six patients had local malignant tumor recurrence within 1 year from diagnosis. Of the 28 patients, 12 had AFP levels measured at diagnosis. Eight patients had normal levels with no further evidence of tumor recurrence, and four had elevated levels with three tumor recurrences. Our experience demonstrates that only at the time of diagnosis do AFP levels correlate with a subsequent malignant behavior of these tumors (P = .004). Those patients with immature teratomas and elevated AFP levels at diagnosis should receive adjuvant chemotherapy after the initial surgical resection.\r"

Complications of lower limb compartment hypertension may be averted by early recognition and fasciotomy. Associated amputations and mortality are directly related to the severity of injury, or indirectly to delay in diagnosis and treatment of the compartment syndrome and its complications.\r"

The arterial injuries were located in the lower extremity (45%), upper extremity (35%), neck (15%), and abdominal aorta (5%). Neurologic trauma (55%) and musculoskeletal trauma (40%) were the most common associated injuries. There was no clinical manifestation of vascular injury in any case. All lesions were identified by arteriography, which was performed for high-risk blunt trauma and proximity of penetrating wounds to major vessels. Intimal flap was the most commonly demonstrated form of injury (65%), followed by focal narrowing (30%) and false aneurysm (5%). Followup of 19 injuries (95%) was obtained for periods ranging from 3 days to 19 months (mean, 3.8 months). Arteriographic followup was obtained in 15 cases (79%). One injury (5%), a false aneurysm, enlarged after 10 weeks and was surgically repaired without clinical sequelae. All other lesions either resolved (53%), improved (16%), or remained unchanged (26%). These results suggest that nonoperative observation may be a safe and feasible method of managing clinically occult arterial injuries.\r"

The present series spans 10 years and consists of nine cases of post-traumatic pediatric pancreatitis, seven of which progressed to pseudocysts. Four of these were externally drained, one was excised, and two resolved spontaneously. We have reviewed this recent experience in order to re-evaluate the efficacy of external drainage of pseudocysts in pediatric patients. We continue to believe that external drainage is the most effective method of therapy. Internal drainage is usually unnecessary unless the drainage from the ductal disruption does not resolve.\r"

T-RTS, the sum of coded values of GCS, SBP, and RR, demonstrated increased sensitivity and some loss in specificity when compared with a triage criterion based on TS and GCS values. T-RTS correctly identified more than 97% of nonsurvivors as requiring trauma center care. The T-RTS triage criterion does not require summing of the coded values and is more easily implemented than the TS criterion. RTS is a weighted sum of coded variable values. The RTS demonstrated substantially improved reliability in outcome predictions compared to the TS. The RTS also yielded more accurate outcome predictions for patients with serious head injuries than the TS.\r"

After 1 month of treatment with a maximum of 42.0 mg. oral yohimbine hydrochloride daily 14 per cent of the patients experienced restoration of full and sustained erections, 20 per cent reported a partial response to the therapy and 65 per cent reported no improvement. Three patients reported a positive placebo effect. Maximum effect takes 2 to 3 weeks to manifest itself. Yohimbine was active in some patients with arterial insufficiency and a unilateral sacral reflex arc lesion, and in 1 with low serum testosterone levels. The 34 per cent response is encouraging, particularly in a Veterans Administration population presenting with a high incidence of diabetes and vascular pathological conditions not found in regular office patients. Only few and benign side effects were recorded, which makes this medication worth an attempt, often as a first line of treatment even at a dose of 8 tablets.\r"

Patient age at hospitalization ranged from 39 to 87 years, with a median age of 64 years. The disease was stage 1 in 12 patients, stage 2 in 11 and stage 3 in 5. Histologically, most of the neoplasms were of the diffuse large cell type, with an immunoblastic type being the most common. Immunohistochemistry revealed that all but 2 cases were of the B cell type. None of the tumors reacted with monoclonal antibody for T cell. These findings suggested that testicular lymphoma exclusively consisted of the B cell type, identical to previous reports of extranodal lymphomas other than those in the skin. The pertinent literature is reviewed and the histogenesis of testicular lymphoma is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated 98 hospital patients, debilitated by serious illness or major surgery with or without candiduria, for the development of candidal antigenemia with a commercially prepared antibody-coated latex particle assay. Group 1 (41 patients) had persistent Candida albicans candiduria (colony counts of more than 10,000 per ml.), group 2 (25 patients) had candiduria (more than 10,000 colonies per ml.) due to species other than Candida albicans and group 3 (32 patients) had no documented candiduria. Indwelling urinary catheters were present in 78 per cent of the patients in group 1, 80 per cent in group 2 and 66 per cent in group 3. In group 1 elevated candidal antigen titers of 1 to 8 or more occurred in 87 per cent of the patients with candiduria and other positive sites and in 31 per cent of those with candiduria alone (p less than 0.005), compared to 50 and 18 per cent, respectively, in group 2. In group 3 positive candidal cultures subsequently developed from other sites in 6 patients, 2 of whom had elevated titers. Patients with indwelling urinary catheters and candiduria had higher candidal antigen titers than patients without positive urine cultures. Increased mortality was noted in patients with elevated titers of 1 to 8 and urine cultures positive for Candida albicans plus other positive sites than in those with candiduria alone (100 versus 63 per cent, p less than 0.005). In groups 2 and 3 there was a higher mortality rate among patients with candiduria plus other positive sites. The sensitivity of elevated candidal antigen titers in the presence of candiduria and/or multiple positive culture sites was 62.8 per cent, with a specificity of 84 per cent and a predictive value of 68.7 per cent. We conclude that the commercial candidal antigen detection system was a useful laboratory adjunct in the evaluation of the debilitated patient with candiduria.\r"

The pyramid procedure is described, which allows for an end-on dissection of the distal megameatus-urethra, enabling a reduction in caliber of both while facilitating remodeling of the glans. The procedure has proved to be successful and reliable for this particular hypospadias variant. No complications have been encountered.\r"

Followup for 2 to 8 years revealed no urogenital problems but a longer period (at least until puberty) is needed. Clinical and etiological aspects of this entity are discussed. Many of the etiological factors cited as possible causes of prolonged erection at this patient age represent only predisposing conditions for the occurrence of penile erection. Because of the spontaneous disappearance of prolonged penile erection, observation rather than surgical or medical management is advocated for the newborn. Only in selected patients should the limit of expectation, and the best time for and type of surgical intervention be established.\r"

Specimens were taken from 11 patients with TCC and five with healthy bladder mucosa. Four patients with TCC and four with healthy mucosa had been previously treated with a course of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Ten out of 11 TCC samples expressed class I glycoproteins with a membrane pattern (diffuse in seven, focal in three) as normal epithelial cells from either controls or perineoplastic bladder. Interestingly, eight out of 11 TCC samples expressed class II antigens on their membrane that were also present in six cases in the perineoplastic tissue while the epithelial cells from four out of five normal bladders were completely negative. The epithelial display of class II antigens in the non-neoplastic areas and in the normal bladder correlates (p less than 0.001) with the degree of cellular infiltrate while such a relationship was not found between the HLA II expression of neoplastic cells and the infiltrate. BCG treatment was associated with a higher amount of inflammatory cells, prevalently T \"activated\" cells (CD5+,DR+), with a CD4/CD8 ratio always greater than 1. In the light of the role played by HLA glycoproteins in immune mechanisms, these results could help explain the positive action of BCG and the relative immunosensitivity of TCC.\r"

Antibody (0.25 to four mg./kg. BW) was administered 0.5 hour before, or premixed for one hour with, lipopolysaccharide (0.05 mg./kg., a 14 to 18% lethal dose), and the following measurements made over 0.5 to 3.5 hours of study: systemic arterial blood pressure, renal plasma flow, and glomerular filtration. The proximal tubular cell cytotoxicity of 90 mg./kg. of the cephalosporin cephaloridine was also quantified in similarly treated animals sacrificed 48 hours later. While one mg./kg. of antibody prevented the reduction by the lipopolysaccharide of renal plasma flow, it did not prevent the nephrotoxic synergy with cephaloridine, and four times the antibody dose did not prevent lipopolysaccharide-induced hypotension or reduced glomerular filtration. These amounts of this antibody protect leukopenic rabbits against the lethality of the slow onset bacteremic model of Pseudomonas conjunctivitis. It is suggested that the incompleteness of protection in this study may be the result of the sensitivity of the assay methods used and/or the acute endotoxemia produced in these animals.\r"

The subpopulations of tissue infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were examined by staining six serial sections with Leu4, Leu7, Leu10, LeuM3, OKT4, and OKT8 antibodies. T cells predominated over B cells in 19 of 25 bladder tumors. T cell infiltration was prominent around tumor cells, and it was marked in non-invasive tumors. B cells were rare in the stroma. In patients with low-stage tumors, OKT8 cells were more prominent than OKT4 cells. NK cells accumulated within cancer nests but their infiltration was scanty in invasive bladder tumors. Before surgery, immunomodulators (OK-432, IL-2) were injected intratumorally. Their administration resulted in marked increase of T and NK cells, irrespective of the stage of disease; there was a slight increase in B cells. These findings suggest that local immunosurveillance plays a role against bladder tumors. Further studies are required to elucidate host immune responses in the microenvironment of the cancer site, as well as the systemic immune reaction.\r"

In a canine model of aortic graft infection caused by a bacterial biofilm, the influence of culture media (blood agar and tryptic soy broth) and mechanical surface biofilm disruption (tissue grinding and ultrasonic oscillation) on microorganism recovery was determined. Dacron prostheses colonized in vitro with Staphylococcus epidermidis were implanted in the infrarenal aortas of 36 dogs. After 3 weeks an infection with anatomic characteristics of late graft infection in humans was present. Explantation (+/- surface biofilm disruption) of infected grafts showed broth culture was superior (p less than 0.001) to agar media in confirming infection. The recovery rate of S. epidermidis was 30% with agar media, was 72% with broth media alone, and was 83% with broth media plus biofilm disruption. In situ replacement of infected grafts plus parenteral antibiotics resulted in early (1 month) healing of 31 grafts without signs of infection. All replacement grafts were sterile when cultured in broth media alone, but the addition of biofilm disruption isolated the study strain from eight (22%) of 36 grafts (p less than 0.01). Biofilm disruption by tissue grinding or sonication increased bacteria recovery equally. When biofilm bacterial concentration was less than 100 colony-forming units/cm2 of graft, only culture in broth media reliably recovered microorganisms. In the absence of perigraft inflammation, microbiologic recovery techniques that identify bacterial biofilms are necessary to exclude infection in studies concerning the pathogenesis of late graft complications or the treatment of S. epidermidis prosthetic infections.\r"

Intraoperative ultrasonography was used to assess the technical adequacy of 80 carotid endarterectomies. Sixty-two arteries were normal on intraoperative ultrasound examination, whereas the remaining 18 arteries had a total of 21 minor residual technical defects. The 21 minor defects consisted of four internal carotid artery lesions, nine common carotid artery lesions, and eight external carotid artery lesions, 19 had 1 to 3 mm intimal flaps, and two had small stenoses. Sixteen of the 19 intimal flaps resolved before the first postoperative ultrasound study. These arteries had normal examination results, which indicated that these intimal flaps had healed. The two stenoses detected intraoperatively could not be detected by postoperative carotid duplex scanning at 1 month follow-up. No statistically significant relationship was found between the presence of a minor residual defect on intraoperative ultrasonography and the subsequent development of recurrent stenosis or occlusion in any of the arteries assessed. These data suggest that certain minor technical defects in the carotid artery that were detected by intraoperative ultrasonography are benign and may not require repeat exploration of the carotid artery for repair.\r"

  ".W": "Ten mongrel dogs underwent left lower extremity in situ femoropopliteal bypass with femoral vein. A 20 to 25 cm myocutaneous bridge was left between femoral and popliteal anastomoses. A 2.8 mm angioscope was introduced intraluminally to visualize venous tributaries (VT). A balloon occlusion catheter was placed alongside the angioscope and directed in each VT. Prolamine was injected into each VT to effect occlusion. Seven dogs were followed up for 1 week and three dogs for 1 month. A total of 34 VT (range one to five per dog) were available for attempted occlusion. Twenty-nine of 84 (85%) VT were able to be occluded based on comparison of pre-VT and post-VT occlusion angiograms. Poor visualization of VT or VT too small to admit the 5F catheter were reasons for failure. We conclude that (1) in the canine model studied angioscope-assisted occlusion of femoropopliteal during bypass is technically feasible, (2) this technical detail makes unnecessary medial thigh dissection for exposure of the vein graft, and (3) during short-term observation prolamine appeared to be a suitable occluding substance.\r"

There is debate over the best method of direct reconstruction. Twenty-six patients undergoing transsternal innominate artery repair over a 12-year period were reviewed to determine if either grafting or endarterectomy was superior and what technical factors might be responsible for success or failure. Most of the patients were women. Twenty-four of the patients had atherosclerotic lesions, whereas the other two had Takayasu's arteritis. Either neurologic or right upper extremity symptoms were present in 24 patients. Sixteen patients had grafting, and 10 underwent endarterectomy. There was one death. There were no strokes or transient ischemic attacks. Three patients experienced recurrence of their symptoms; all had failures of reconstruction. The use of a bifurcated graft in one patient was probably responsible for one recurrence of symptoms. Single limb grafts with added side arms are probably preferable to bifurcated grafts. Innominate artery grafting and innominate endarterectomy are equally effective, although grafting is applicable to more patients. Direct transsternal repair is the procedure of choice to correct innominate occlusive disease in patients who are good candidates for correction.\r"

During a recent 22-month period 1776 patients were evaluated in our laboratory for DVT. Sixty patients (64 limbs) underwent ascending venography within 48 hours of testing (49 limbs were evaluated by all three modalities). With the venograms used as the reference standard, B-mode scanning correctly identified the presence of acute thrombus in 24 of 27 limbs (88.8%) and the absence of thrombus in 31 of 34 limbs (91.2%), for an overall accuracy of 90.6%. IPG alone was less sensitive (75%) and less specific (44.8%), with an overall accuracy of only 57.1%. Twenty-eight IPGs were performed on patients with negative venous scans. Two positive IPGs were the result of chronic venous occlusion and two others detected clinically significant isolated iliac vein thrombi, but 13 patients had false positive IPGs. One false negative IPG occurred. The difference in the sensitivity of scan alone vs scan plus IPG was not significant (chi 2 = 0.045; difference not significant), but the decrease in specificity was chi 2 = 17.3; p less than 0.001). The rarity of isolated iliac vein thrombosis and the high false positive rate for IPG do not justify its continued use if B-mode venous scanning is available. Although positive scan results may be used confidently to institute therapy without the need for venography, in high-risk patients with a strong clinical suspicion of proximal DVT despite a negative scan venography should be obtained before withholding anticoagulation.\r"

  ".W": "Although rare, major wound breakdown after infrainguinal bypass resulting in vein graft exposure carries the risk of vein graft disruption with threat to both life and limb. The use of sartorius muscle rotation-transfer specifically in the management of exposed autogenous infrainguinal vein grafts has not been previously described. Eight patients were evaluated for major wound disruption resulting in graft exposure after infrainguinal vein bypass. Soft tissue coverage was provided in all eight cases by means of a distally based sartorius muscle rotation flap. There was no instance of postoperative death, graft thrombosis, secondary hemorrhage, or persistent infection. Late follow-up has shown continued satisfactory results. We conclude that effective soft tissue coverage and salvage of exposed infrainguinal vein bypass grafts can be accomplished in selected cases by means of sartorius muscle rotation-transfer.\r"

  ".U": "89259202\r", 
  ".W": "This study tests the hypothesis that reperfusion injury is the principal cause of limb loss after acute arterial occlusion and that this injury is avoidable. Of 61 isolated hindlimbs amputated at the level of the hip joint, 17 were controls (group I), 5 were perfused without ischemia to establish the validity of the model (group II), and 15 underwent 4 hours of ischemia at room temperature without reperfusion (group III). Acute embolectomy was simulated in 24 limbs after 4 hours of ischemia; 12 were reperfused with standard Krebs-Henseleit solution at 100 mm Hg (group IV), and 12 were reperfused under controlled conditions (i.e., 37 degrees C, 50 mm Hg) with substrate-enriched modified reperfusate (group V). Leg volume, water content, contractile function, and high-energy phosphate content were assessed and data were expressed as mean +/- SD. Four hours of ischemia caused a profound fall in adenosine triphosphate content (4.0 vs 26.0 mmol/L/gm of protein, p less than or equal to 0.001). Uncontrolled reperfusion resulted in severe reperfusion injury; massive edema developed (83% vs 75%, p less than or equal to 0.01), leg volume increased markedly (21.5% above control, p less than or equal to 0.001), and no contractile function followed electrical stimulation. In contrast, controlled reperfusion resulted in normal water content (76.9% vs 75.0%, NS) and minimal change of leg volume (5.5% +/- 5% of control, NS), replenished adenosine triphosphate completely (24.2 vs 26.4 mmol/L/gm of protein, NS), and restored immediate contractile function in all limbs (24.3% +/- 14% of control). This study shows that 4 hours of room-temperature ischemia (18 degrees C) does not produce irreversible damage of the rat hindlimb because the reperfusion injury that follows uncontrolled reperfusion can be avoided. Immediate recovery of contractile function can be restored if the conditions of reperfusion are controlled by gentle reperfusion pressure (50 mm Hg) at 37 degrees C and if a modified substrate-enriched, hyperosmotic, alkalotic, low-Ca++ reperfusate is administered.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of atenolol, a beta 1-selective blocker, along with flunarizine, a calcium antagonist, in the management of Raynaud's disease. Forty patients with Raynaud's disease were randomized into a trial in which atenolol (50 mg daily) was given with flunarizine (10 mg daily). During the trial all patients were subjected to finger photoplethysmography and were given a diary to note daily the number and duration of the crises and presence or absence of pain and paresthesia. The association of atenolol with flunarizine caused an 80% reduction in the number of vasospastic crises, a significant increase (p less than 0.001) in the photoplethysmographic wave amplitude, and complete disappearance of pain and paresthesia. These results were not observed in patients treated with a placebo. Flunarizine reinforces the action of atenolol in causing a decrease in vasoconstriction in patients with Raynaud's disease, as observed previously by us, in that it acts directly on the beta-presynaptic receptors or on the calcium slow channels connected to the beta-receptors. The present study confirms that the principal role in the physiopathologic progression of Raynaud's disease seems to be played by a modification of the beta-presynaptic receptors in the nerve endings of the peripheral vessels.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1, 1969, and December 31, 1984, 55 operative procedures were carried out in 47 patients to correct subclavian-axillary artery lesions resulting from compression at the thoracic outlet. The most common causes of compression were a long cervical rib (27) and an anomalous first rib (15). Presenting features included claudication, vasomotor phenomena, digital gangrene, and acute limb-threatening ischemia. A combined supraclavicular and infraclavicular approach was preferred. Decompression was best achieved by excision of the cervical rib and the first rib and division of all soft tissue elements. The most common methods of arterial repair were resection-anastomosis (23) and replacement of vein graft (11). Embolic occlusions were frequently present (35). Axillary emboli were amenable to direct revascularization at the time of subclavian artery repair. If possible, more-distal embolic occlusions were managed without recourse to embolectomy catheter manipulations. The mean follow-up was 5 years 8 months (range 4 months to 16 years). Patients were assessed clinically, and the arterial repair was monitored by Doppler ultrasonography, B-mode scanning, and digital subtraction angiography. Of the 39 patients available for follow-up, 35 had no symptoms and four had residual claudication. There were no amputations. In the remaining cases the subclavian-axillary artery segment showed no hemodynamic or anatomic abnormality.\r"

  ".W": "The rapid establishment of an endothelial cell (EC) monolayer on the luminal surface of small-diameter vascular grafts may be necessary to prevent early thrombosis and failure. We have studied procedures used to promote EC coverage of vascular grafts and have compared preclotting prosthetic surfaces with ECs in platelet-rich plasma (seeding) with plating ECs onto a preestablished clot (sodding). We evaluated the rate of monolayer formation, the subsequent resistance to shear stress, and the effects of EC growth factors (ECGF and heparin) on these functions. Woven Dacron was seeded or sodded at a density of 2 x 10(5) cells/cm2 with human adult microvessel ECs derived from adipose tissue. In the presence of ECGF-heparin, the immediate establishment of an EC layer after sodding was observed, whereas seeded grafts required almost 48 hours for cells to reach the surface. In the absence of ECGF-heparin, sodded grafts still exhibited a complete monolayer of EC, whereas ECs were not observed at the surface of seeded grafts after 48 hours. After exposure to shear stress (up to 20 dynes/cm2) for 2 hours, most freshly sodded EC remained attached; however, the loss of loosely adherent cells did occur. EC seeded grafts remained covered with fibrin matrix after exposure to shear stress. We conclude that the use of a microvessel sodding technique as an alternative to previously reported seeding techniques is necessary for the immediate formation of an EC monolayer before implantation.\r"

  ".U": "89259207\r", 
  ".W": "Preoperative transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPo2) measurements of calf and brachial skin were performed on 40 patients before they underwent below-knee amputation (BKA); dual calf measurements on the anterior and posterior skin were obtained. Both anterior and posterior calf tcPo2 values were significantly lower in patients with unsuccessful wound healing after BKA compared to those with successful healing (p less than 0.01). Successful wound healing occurred in 50% (6/12) of patients with calf tcPo2 values less than 20 torr and in 96% (27/28) of patients with calf tcPo2 values greater than 20 torr. Calculation of a critical Po2 index (defined as the lesser of the anterior and posterior calf/brachial tcPo2 ratios) resulted in improved predictive accuracy; 100% (6/6) of patients with a critical Po2 index of 0.20 or less had unsuccessful wound healing after BKA, whereas 97% (33/34) of patients with a critical Po2 index greater than 0.20 had successful healing. The use of a critical Po2 index greater than 0.20 as predictive of successful healing after BKA was associated with a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 100%, 86%, and 98%, respectively, compared to 82%, 86%, and 83%, respectively, by use of absolute calf tcPo2 values. In conclusion, multisensor transcutaneous oximetric mapping is an accurate method for predicting wound healing success after BKA. Measurement of both anterior and posterior calf tcPo2 should be performed; calf tcPo2 values less than 20 torr may indicate local ischemia, but ischemia should be confirmed by comparison of calf tcPo2 with brachial tcPo2 before the patient is denied BKA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The fistula was successfully repaired, with preservation of the kidney, by autotransfusion. Review of the English language literature revealed the differences between spontaneous and traumatic ALRVF. Spontaneous fistulas were caused by rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm into a retroaortic left renal vein. Hematuria was almost constant (93% of cases). The operative mortality rate was 14%. By contrast, traumatic ALRVFs were the result of a penetrating wound to the abdomen. The left renal vein was in a normal position, anterior to the aorta. Hematuria was less common (16% of cases). The diagnosis was delayed because clinical signs were less acute. There were no reports of postoperative deaths.\r"
