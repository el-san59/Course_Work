The nature of their neurotransmitter is still debated. Speculation that nitric oxide (NO), formed from L-arginine in neuronal structures and other cells, could act as a neurotransmitter, is not yet supported by demonstration of its release upon nerve stimulation. Using a superfusion bioassay, we report the release of a vasorelaxant factor upon stimulation of the NANC nerves in the canine ileocolonic junction. Several pieces of evidence, including the selectivity of the bioassay tissues, chemical instability, inactivation by superoxide anion and haemoglobin, inhibition by NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) and potentiation by L-arginine all indicated that NO accounted for the biological activity of this transferable NANC factor.\r"

Four of these genes code for nuclear proteins that belong to a larger family characterized by a conserved helix-loop-helix motif required for DNA-binding and dimerization. At least one protein, MyoD1, can function as a transcription factor and activate muscle-specific genes during differentiation. But the promoter of the delta-subunit gene of the mouse acetylcholine receptor (AChR) was recently reported to be functional in the absence of MyoD1 binding sites and it has been suggested that the genes coding for the AChR could be regulated independently of MyoD1 protein. Here, we identify two functional MyoD1-binding sites in the muscle-specific enhancer of the chicken AChR alpha-subunit gene that are essential for full activity in transfected myotubes.\r"

Both intragenic and extragenic mutations as well as changes in wild-type gene dosage can delay or block the time of onset of the neuronal deaths. The deg-1 gene has been cloned and a partial complementary DNA reveals that the gene encodes a novel protein that may act as a membrane receptor. Because the late-onset loss of specific sets of neurons, often as a result of dominant mutations, is characteristic of several human neurodegenerative diseases, the analysis of the deg-1 gene and its suppressors may provide a means of understanding the mechanisms underlying some of these human diseases.\r"

  ".W": "To generate behaviour, the brain must transform sensory information into signals that are appropriate to control movement. Sensory and motor coordinate frames are fundamentally different, however: sensory coordinates are based on the spatiotemporal patterns of activity arising from the various sense organs, whereas motor coordinates are based on the pulling directions of muscles or groups of muscles. Results from psychophysical experiments suggest that in the process of transforming sensory information into motor control signals, the brain encodes movements in abstract or extrinsic coordinate frames, that is ones not closely related to the geometry of the sensory apparatus or of the skeletomusculature. Here we show that an abstract code underlies movements of the head by the barn owl. Specifically, the data show that subsequent to the retinotopic code for space in the optic tectum yet before the motor neuron code for muscle tensions there exists a code for head movement in which upward, downward, leftward and rightward components of movement are controlled by four functionally distinct neural circuits. Such independent coding of orthogonal components of movement may be a common intermediate step in the transformation of sensation into behaviour.\r"

Rhythmically active or oscillating neural circuits are particularly interesting dynamical structures, as rhythms and oscillations are a prominent feature of mammalian central nervous system electrophysiology. Coherent oscillations by networks of interneurons are observed in the vertebrate olfactory system and have recently been described in mammalian visual cortex. These interneuronal networks display oscillations in local field potential (LFP) and probability of producing action potentials that are highly correlated between subcircuits sharing the same stimulus features. Much less is known about the existence and importance of network oscillations in the higher centres of invertebrates. Here we report that a network of olfactory interneurons in the cerebral ganglion of the terrestrial mollusc Limax maximus also displays coherent oscillations in LFP which are modified by odour input. This dynamical structure could be central to the odour recognition and odour learning ability of Limax.\r"

  ".W": "The period of natural cell death in the development of rodent motor neurons is followed by a period of sensitivity to axonal injury. In the rat this early postnatal period of vulnerability coincides with that of very low ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) levels in the sciatic nerve before CNTF increases to the high, adult levels. The developmental time course of CNTF expression, its regional tissue distribution and its cytosolic localization (as suggested by its primary structure) favour a role for CNTF as a lesion factor rather than a target-derived neurotrophic molecule like nerve growth factor. Nevertheless CNTF exhibits neurotrophic activity in vitro on different populations of embryonic neurons. To determine whether the vulnerability of motor neurons to axotomy in the early postnatal phase is due to insufficient availability of CNTF, we transected the axons of newborn rat motor neurons and demonstrated that local application of CNTF prevents the degeneration of the corresponding cell bodies.\r"

There is a rare class of patients, exemplified by haemophilia B Leyden, who suffer from haemophilia B as children but improve after puberty. In these patients, plasma factor IX concentrations are less than 10% of normal during childhood, but after puberty they gradually rise to between 40 and 80% of normal. Mutations clustered around the main transcription start point (defined as +1 (ref.2)) have been reported in seven of these patients (at -20 (refs 1, 3, 4); -6 (refs 5, 6) and +13 (refs 7, 8)). To determine how these mutations interfere with factor IX expression, we have assayed for transcription factors binding to this area and have identified a nuclear factor-1 liver (NF1-L) binding site (-99 to -76) and a binding site for the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) (+1 to +18). We show that the A----G mutation at +13 prevents the binding of C/EBP to this site. Furthermore, we show that C/EBP is capable of transactivating a cotransfected normal factor IX promoter but not the mutant promoter. This is the first natural mutation to be reported which disrupts a C/EBP binding site and is an illustration of the importance of this transcription factor in humans.\r"

Biopsies of NPC tumours have revealed expression of the EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) in 65% of cases, suggesting that in at least some NPC tumours LMP may contribute to cell transformation. Here we address the question of the effect of LMP expression on epithelial cells. Transfection of an immortalized, non-tumorigenic keratinocyte cell line (RHEK-1) with the LMP gene causes a striking morphological transformation: the originally flat, polygonal colonies change to bundles of spindle-shaped cells that form multilayer foci, and cytokeratin expression is down-regulated. Our results suggest that LMP expression may be an important causal factor in the development of NPC.\r"

This phenotype suggests a defect in the association of intracellular antigen with class I molecules similar to that described for the murine mutant RMA-S (ref. 5), but in the present case the genetic defect can be mapped within the MHC locus on human chromosome 6.\r"

  ".W": "The terminus of a DNA helix has been called its Achilles' heel. Thus to prevent possible incomplete replication and instability of the termini of linear DNA, eukaryotic chromosomes end in characteristic repetitive DNA sequences within specialized structures called telomeres. In immortal cells, loss of telomeric DNA due to degradation or incomplete replication is apparently balanced by telomere elongation, which may involve de novo synthesis of additional repeats by novel DNA polymerase called telomerase. Such a polymerase has been recently detected in HeLa cells. It has been proposed that the finite doubling capacity of normal mammalian cells is due to a loss of telomeric DNA and eventual deletion of essential sequences. In yeast, the est1 mutation causes gradual loss of telomeric DNA and eventual cell death mimicking senescence in higher eukaryotic cells. Here, we show that the amount and length of telomeric DNA in human fibroblasts does in fact decrease as a function of serial passage during ageing in vitro and possibly in vivo. It is not known whether this loss of DNA has a causal role in senescence.\r"

At follow-up, 19 patients (56%) were free of disease and 15 were dead of disease. Three patients developed a \"bridge\" recurrence, one patient each with original stages I, II, and IV. Two of these patients were free of disease and one patient died of disease. Ten patients had metastatic disease to the groin lymph nodes at the time of recurrence, and all of these patients are dead of disease. Therapy for the recurrence consisted of five radical vulvectomies (80% survival), four pelvic exenterations (25% survival), and 25 wide radical excisions (56% survival). The lymph node status was highly significant in predicting outcome, with zero of ten patients remaining free of disease when the lymph nodes were involved and 19 of 24 free of disease when the lymph nodes were uninvolved (P less than .0001). Factors that did not influence survival included the institution where the initial surgery was performed and the interval from initial therapy to recurrence. Twenty patients received their initial therapy at the University of Michigan and 12 (60%) were free of disease. Fourteen patients were referred from outside institutions for their recurrence and seven (50%) were free of disease. Nineteen patients had a recurrence within 2 years and nine were free of disease, ten patients recurred between 2-10 years of whom seven were free of disease, and five patients recurred after 10 years with three free of disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and carcinomas. The present study involved women who had an abnormal Papanicolaou smear and whose cervix contained acetowhite area(s) that lacked the histologic features of CIN. Sequences homologous to HPV DNA, determined by Southern blot hybridization analysis, were detected in 20 of 59 cervical biopsy specimens (34%) that lacked the histologic features of CIN. When compared with the group in which HPV DNA was not detected, the HPV DNA-positive group had a lower chance of having a normal Papanicolaou smear (30 versus 61%) at the time of the biopsy. There was no difference in the colposcopic findings between the HPV DNA-positive and -negative cases for the biopsy specimens that lacked the features of CIN. However, there was a difference in the rate of histologically proved CIN in the two groups. Twelve of 17 women (71%) in the HPV DNA-positive group for whom there was follow-up information had a biopsy-proved CIN lesion noted at another location in the cervix at the time of biopsy (six) or 3-12 months after the biopsy (six). This rate was significantly higher (P less than .05) than the rate (five of 25, 20%) in the HPV DNA-negative cases, most of whom had no colposcopic abnormalities and a normal Papanicolaou smear at the follow-up examination. These findings indicate that HPV DNA detection in women with cervical lesions that lack the histologic features of CIN predicts current or future CIN in such patients.\r"

To assess the prognostic significance of this cell type, the medical records of 29 patients with stage IB primary adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix were reviewed. Twenty-six had cervical tumors measuring 3 cm or less. With a median follow-up of 60 months, the overall disease-free 5-year survival was 85%. Pelvic lymph node metastases were found in three of 19 patients (16%) with stage IB, and periaortic lymph nodes were negative in eight. A log-likelihood chi 2 test comparing lymphatic spread, recurrence rate, and 5-year disease-free survival in patients with stage IB disease and tumors less than 3 cm versus a similar group of 58 patients with pure squamous cell carcinoma of equivalent stage and comparable size treated during the same time disclosed no significant differences in any of the indicators analyzed. We conclude that stage IB adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix does not differ in its metastatic potential or outcome from the more common pure squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

In the current study, 70 endometrial cancer patients with suspected cervical involvement based on a positive endocervical curettage or punch biopsy were treated with initial surgery followed by tailored radiation or chemotherapy. Only 37% of the patients had operative findings consistent with the preoperative suspicion of stage II disease. Postoperative therapy was determined by the extent of cervical involvement, depth of myometrial invasion, cell type, tumor grade, and the presence and location of extra-uterine disease. Based upon these parameters, 21 patients were believed to have low risk for pelvic recurrence and received no adjuvant therapy (90% 5-year survival); 38 patients received postoperative pelvic radiation because of high-risk factors for pelvic recurrence or pelvic nodal involvement (65% 5-year survival); and 11 patients received chemotherapy and/or extended radiation because of extrapelvic disease (no 5-year survivors). The approach outlined supports initial surgery for cases of endometrial cancer with suspected cervical involvement. This approach permits accurate surgical staging under the new FIGO system, avoids radiotherapy in many patients whose disease is less extensive than suspected preoperatively, and can accomplish good local control with limited morbidity.\r"

Among the patients with uterine malignancies, a few cases showed a sialyl Tn antigen level in excess of the cutoff limit (39 U/mL). In the patients with ovarian cancers, serum sialyl Tn antigen was significantly elevated: clinical stage I, 31%; stage II, 29%; and stage III, 69%. The antigen level also correlated with the effect of treatment. In addition, malignant fluid exhibited a high sialyl Tn antigen level, whereas benign fluid showed no elevation. However, serum sialyl Tn antigen was elevated in 6% of the patients with benign ovarian cysts and in 1.5% of normal volunteers. The current findings demonstrate that the lack of tumor specificity of sialyl Tn antigen limits its diagnostic value in gynecologic malignancies, but that serial measurement of this antigen appears to be useful for monitoring patients and evaluating therapy.\r"

Although this method carries morbidity and mortality rates significantly lower than methods requiring labor induction, the procedure most commonly used for second-trimester genetic terminations seems to be labor induction (eg, vaginal prostaglandin suppositories). Many geneticists appear reluctant to recommend D&E over induction methods of pregnancy termination because they perceive that fetal abnormalities cannot be consistently confirmed by evaluation of the products of conception obtained by D&E. We report here 60 consecutive patients who underwent D&E (14-22 weeks' gestation) after detection of fetal abnormalities. The prenatal diagnoses were confirmed in all cases. Our experience thus indicates that D&E is reliable in confirming most prenatal diagnoses and should be the procedure of choice when second-trimester pregnancy termination is chosen because of fetal abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Most pregnancies with severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome before 27 weeks' gestation result in perinatal death. Previous attempts at therapy have been generally unsatisfactory and rarely successful. We have developed a technique for intrauterine ablation of the vascular communications between the fetoplacental circulations with a fetoscopically directed neodymium:YAG laser. The operation was performed on three women at risk for pregnancy loss from acute hydramnios at 18.5, 22, and 22.5 weeks' gestation. The first two procedures were uneventful, but the third was complicated by a placental vessel perforation. The first two patients delivered at 27 and 34 weeks after premature rupture of membranes and spontaneous labor, whereas the third woman developed severe preeclampsia at 29 weeks which necessitated delivery. Four of the six infants survived. Clinical and ultrasonographic evidence, as well as pathologic examination of the placentas, suggested that stabilization or resolution of the syndrome was due to photocoagulation of the vascular communications. This initial experience suggests that fetoscopic laser occlusion of placental vessels is feasible and superior to previous therapies because it treats the underlying pathophysiology directly.\r"

Initial phone contact was followed by a questionnaire. Outcome was known for 594 of the 606 pregnancies, with a total of 502 live-born children including 15 sets of twins. The spontaneous abortion rate was 16.5%, with no difference between fresh- and frozen-semen pregnancies. Significant correlations were found between spontaneous abortion rate and maternal age (P less than .001) and spontaneous abortion rate and cycle of conception (P less than .025). Follow-up was completed on 481 children, among whom the following were found: one chromosomal anomaly, 22 major congenital anomalies, four children with possibly syndromic conditions, and 38 with minor congenital anomalies. Of the school-aged children, 5.8% had recognized learning disabilities and 10.5% were considered gifted by their schools. We also investigated the psychological impact of AID on each family. The majority of couples (71.7%) informed their obstetricians of the AID. Half of the couples did not tell any family or friends. Many couples did not (47%) or probably did not (14%) plan to tell their children of their origins. The divorce rate among those with AID children was 7.2%, which was significantly less (P less than .01) than that in a matched population. Psychological counseling specifically related to AID was sought by 2.8% of the couples. We conclude that AID children are at similar risk for congenital anomalies as normally conceived children, but they experience lower rates of family dissolution.\r"

All patients were managed under the same standardized protocol requiring weekly visits and decreased physical activity. The population studied consisted of four groups of pregnancies with the following uterine anomalies: unicornuate (five), bicornuate (61), septate (25), and didelphys (ten). Sixty percent of the pregnancies in the unicornuate and didelphys group reached term, 39% in the bicornuate group, and 48% in the septate group. Preterm labor requiring tocolysis occurred in 21% of the pregnancies in the bicornuate group and 15% of the pregnancies in the septate group. Cerclage was placed in 5% of the pregnancies in the bicornuate group. Before our care, the fetal survival rate for pregnancies in the bicornuate and septate groups was 52 and 53%, respectively; with our management protocol, it was 58 and 65%, differences that were not statistically significant. Our experience suggests that high-risk obstetric intervention does not obviate the potential benefit of metroplasty, especially for patients with a bicornuate or septate uterus. We believe that traditional indications for metroplasty should continue to be used.\r"

An increased risk was noted for tubal pregnancy associated with previous ruptured appendix (relative risk 1.8, 95% confidence interval 0.6-5.5), but the increase was well within the limits of chance. With the possible exception of ruptured appendix, our study indicates that abdominal surgery that does not directly involve the fallopian tubes has little or no influence on the occurrence of tubal pregnancy.\r"

Those with uterine size over 10 cm or large submucous fibroids were usually excluded because of technical difficulty in performing the procedure. Treatment outcome was not related to patient weight, uterine size, or small intrauterine abnormalities. Twelve patients had medical conditions that were relative contraindications for hysterectomy, and 11 were treated successfully. Endometrial ablation with the Nd:Yag laser is an effective alternative to hysterectomy in patients with uncontrolled benign uterine bleeding.\r"

To evaluate pentoxifylline in a situation more closely mimicking the events encountered in infertility surgery, we developed a model for adhesion reformation after lysis of pelvic adhesions. New Zealand White rabbits received a standardized primary traumatic lesion to the left uterine horn. One week later, a laparotomy was performed for evaluation (prescore) and subsequent lysis of adhesions. After closure, the animals were randomized to treatment with vehicle or subcutaneous pentoxifylline, 2.5 mg/kg, administered at 12-hour intervals for six doses. Seven days later, the rabbits were sacrificed and evaluated in a blinded manner to quantify adhesion reformation (postscore). Using a scoring scale from 0 = no adhesions to 4+ = most severe, the mean prescore was not different between pentoxifylline-treated and control rabbits (3.8 versus 3.9, respectively). However, the mean postscore (0.7 versus 3.7, respectively) was markedly reduced by pentoxifylline (P less than .001). These data demonstrate a marked inhibition of adhesion reformation after lysis of pelvic adhesions under the influence of pentoxifylline in rabbits.\r"

For multiparas, the median duration of pregnancy was 269 days, also significantly longer than the prediction (P = .019). Moreover, the median length of pregnancy in primiparas proved to be significantly longer than that for multiparas (P = .0032). Thus, this study suggests that when estimating a due date for private-care white patients, one should count back 3 months from the first day of the last menses, then add 15 days for primiparas or 10 days for multiparas, instead of using the common algorithm for Naegele's rule.\r"

Also at 16 weeks, there was a doubling in the risk of excessive fetal size or macrosomia (adjusted odds ratio 2.31; 95% confidence interval 1.31-4.10) associated with maternal weight gain above the 75th percentile. These results suggest that an increased risk of certain poor pregnancy outcomes is detectable late in the first or early in the second trimester. Consequently, weight gain monitoring may be important early in pregnancy.\r"

Seven subjects were studied at 37 weeks' gestation and again 12 weeks postpartum. All were tested at rest and during four sequential exercise bouts consisting of 5 minutes at each of two cycle (50 and 75 W) and two treadmill (67 m x min-1 at 2.5 and 12% grade) protocols. Oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate were measured during the fifth minute of exercise. Arterial and mixed venous oxygen contents, obtained from catheters placed in the radial and pulmonary arteries, respectively, were used to calculate arterial-venous oxygen difference. Cardiac output and stroke volume were calculated from the Fick equation. Responses of VO2, cardiac output, and stroke volume were greater when exercise was performed at 37 weeks' gestation as compared with postpartum. In contrast, heart rate response (during cycling) and arterial-venous oxygen difference (during treadmill walking) were less when exercise was performed during pregnancy. Our results indicate that there is no compromise in maternal cardiac output during either cycle or treadmill exercise performed late in pregnancy as compared with postpartum conditions.\r"

Previously established guidelines for the volume of blood to be given in intraperitoneal transfusion at a specific gestational age are not applicable for intravascular transfusion. In 28 patients, intravascular transfusion was performed on 81 occasions between 19-34 weeks' gestation. The total number of transfusions ranged from one to six per patient. The aim at each procedure was to achieve a final hematocrit of 35-50%. Factors examined as likely to determine the volume of blood required included pre-transfusion hematocrit, post-minus pre-transfusion hematocrit (hematocrit increase), the hematocrit of the transfused blood, gestational age, estimated fetal weight, and interval from last transfusion. The factors found to be most predictive of total volume of blood required for transfusion were the hematocrit increase and either estimated fetal weight or gestational age.\r"

Among the women with eclampsia, 26 CT scans were considered normal with no evidence of cerebral edema, three displayed signs of cerebral hemorrhage or thrombosis, six showed areas of focalized hypodensity located in the cortical lobes and the subcortical white matter, and nine were classified as cerebral atrophy with enlarged cerebral ventricles. We conclude that radiologic evidence of diffuse brain edema is probably not a common feature in eclampsia.\r"

Drug users had lower osteocalcin values than did the normal women (1.3 +/- 0.7 versus 2.7 +/- 0.8 ng/mL, P less than .001); and infants of drug users had lower values than normal infants (14.1 +/- 3.8 versus 19.0 +/- 4.0 ng/mL, P less than .005). The birth weights of drug users' infants were smaller (3160 +/- 402 versus 3591 +/- 374 g, P less than .05) and there was a significant negative correlation (P less than .001) between osteocalcin and drug intake during pregnancy, but no changes in osteocalcin dependent on the type of drug used. These results suggest a toxic effect of these drugs on the osteoblast, which could account for the lower birth weights and skeletal alterations reported in the infants of drug users.\r"

This was repeated for 4 days and medication was taken only after the third measurement. Eight of the nine patients demonstrated a reproducible decrease in IOP ranging from 2 to 18 mmHg within 30 minutes. There are indications that the momentary IOP elevation is associated with wakening. This phenomenon raises interesting questions regarding IOP variations. It indicates that in certain cases significant IOP peaks disappear before the patient can reach the clinic and may have an effect on loss of vision.\r"

Five patients were treated with goniosynechialysis alone, and ten were treated with goniosynechialysis in combination with other surgical procedures. The procedure was successful, in terms of reducing synechiae, in 14 eyes (93%). The extent of angle closure was reduced from 340 degrees +/- 45 degrees (mean +/- standard deviation) preoperatively to 80 degrees +/- 70 degrees postoperatively; the mean reduction was 260 degrees +/- 95 degrees (P less than 0.0001) for the group overall and 280 degrees +/- 80 degrees (P less than 0.0007) for the subgroup treated with goniosynechialysis alone. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 40 +/- 4 mmHg. The mean postoperative IOP was 14 +/- 4 mmHg. The mean reduction in IOP was 26 +/- 15 mmHg (P less than 0.0001) for the group overall and 27 +/- 18 mmHg (P less than 0.015) for the subgroup treated with goniosynechialysis alone. Glaucoma medications were reduced from a mean of 2.6 +/- 1.0 preoperatively to 1.1 +/- 1.2 postoperatively for the group overall and to 1.4 +/- 1.5 for the subgroup treated with goniosynechialysis alone. Complications consisted of two eyes with intraoperative bleeding. One of these required intraoperative conversion to surgical trabeculectomy. The other was associated with a transient postoperative IOP elevation to 40 mmHg. Surgical goniosynechialysis may be an effective means of reducing synechiae and lowering IOP, either alone or in conjunction with other surgical procedures, in patients with angle closures of less than 6 months' duration.\r"

Substantial reductions in intraocular pressures (IOPs) were observed in most patients (preoperative IOPs ranged from 5 to 48 mmHg [mean +/- standard deviation, 33.6 +/- 14.6 mmHg]; postoperative IOPs ranged from 10 to 30 mmHg [mean +/- standard deviation, 16.0 +/- 6.5 mmHg]); follow-up ranged from 9 to 47 months (mean +/- standard deviation, 18.8 +/- 12.1 months). Seven (78%) patients had final postoperative IOPs of less than 22 mmHg, five (56%) retained formed vision (visual acuity of at least 1/200), and six (67%) remained comfortable. Postoperative complications related to Molteno implantation included one case each of: conjunctival wound leak, vitreous-tube block, tube-cornea touch, and iris-tube block (or tube retraction). Complications attributed to epithelial ingrowth included five cases of corneal decompensation with band keratopathy. Molteno implantation is an effective technique for palliative treatment of secondary glaucomas associated with advanced epithelial ingrowth, frequently maintaining modest vision and comfort in eyes in which the intraocular epithelialization is too extensive for surgical removal and/or destruction.\r"

The authors examined 194 previously unreported Thai patients with ODM. Elevated intraocular pressures (IOPs) developed in the ipsilateral eye of 15 patients at initial examination and in 5 others during follow-up, for a total of 10.3% of the patients. Three patients had congenital or late congenital glaucoma, 14 had ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma, and 3 had acute angle-closure glaucoma. Five of the patients with open angles had acute pressure rises accompanied by anterior uveitis. Melanocytic hyperpigmentation of the anterior chamber angle was extensive in all patients except those with acute angle-closure glaucoma. There was no consistent correlation between the extent or density of angle pigmentation and the development of elevated IOP. A larger cup-to-disc ratio in the involved eye, presumably congenital, was present in an additional 19 patients. Glaucoma is common in eyes with ODM and may develop at any age. Patients with ODM and initially normal IOP should be examined at regular intervals. Patients with open angles and acutely elevated IOP should be examined carefully for signs of anterior uveitis and treated medically.\r"

Leakage of Gd-DTPA was seen in the optic nerves and optic chiasm of adult guinea pigs sensitized for acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, but not in normal unsensitized animals. This finding occurred as early as 5 to 8 days after antigenic sensitization with the myelin emulsion and before the onset of paralysis or ataxia. Pathologic examination at this early stage of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis showed an absence of demyelination in the optic nerves and optic chiasm, although scant perivascular foci of inflammatory cells were seen. Leakage of Gd-DTPA in the optic nerve before demyelination of this white matter tract illustrates that increased permeability of the blood-optic nerve barrier is an early, if not the initial, event in autoimmune demyelination, and the optic nerve is a common site of central nervous system involvement during the initial phase of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Findings in this animal model appear comparable with the results of MRI with Gd-DTPA in patients with optic neuritis, and they suggest that disruption of the blood-optic nerve barrier is a common denominator for both disorders of primary demyelination.\r"

In two of these three cases, intraoperative recognition and prompt treatment of the expanding hematoma resulted in preservation of vision. Motility disturbances due to extraocular muscle injury occurred in two patients after intranasal ethmoidectomy and in one patient after a Caldwell-Luc procedure. Bilateral blindness resulted from transection of both optic nerves in one patient during bilateral intranasal endoscopic ethmoidectomies.

The authors found that the clinical presentations could be broken down into four generalized syndromes of presentation: infiltrative (20 cases, 53%); mass (14 cases, 37%); inflammatory (2 cases, 5%); and functional (1 case, 3%). An infiltrative pattern of presentation may be a clue to the metastatic nature of the orbital tumor. There may be no history of systemic cancer; in 25% of the patients in this series, the orbital tumor was the initial manifestation of systemic disease. Although the prognosis is poor for patients with metastatic cancer (average survival in this series, 10.2 months), modern treatment methods continue to improve and long-term palliation is often possible. The ophthalmologist plays a vital role in the diagnosis, histologic evaluation, and referral of these patients.\r"

Serial computed tomography (CT) documented a long period of slow growth, followed by a shorter interval of arrest, with eventual involution of tumor and relief of proptosis. No treatment was administered during observation.\r"

  ".W": "To test the efficacy and safety of orbital decompression for Graves' ophthalmopathy, the authors studied the records of 60 consecutive patients who were operated on for dysthyroid optic neuropathy or for rehabilitative purposes. Patients decompressed for neuropathy were older, had less proptosis, and a shorter duration of eye disease than patients operated on for disfigurement. The authors compared the results of three surgical procedures including the inferomedial, the inferomedial plus lateral, and the coronal approach. Regarding improvement of visual function, no difference was found between the three techniques. Patients in whom vision failed to recover had a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Proptosis reduction varied from 1 to 9 mm, depending on the number of walls decompressed. There was no net change in the prevalence of diplopia. Persistent complications were seen in less than 5% of all decompressions. The authors conclude that orbital decompression for Graves' ophthalmopathy is safe and efficacious, regardless of surgical procedure. However, the coronal approach gives the best cosmetic results.\r"

Thirty-four percent of all eyes and 50% of attached eyes obtained a visual acuity of 5/200 or greater at 6 months. At last examination, 29% of all eyes and 43% of attached eyes had a visual acuity of at least 5/200. Eyes that had circumferential relaxing retinotomies involving the entire temporal quadrant generally had lower visual acuities when compared with eyes that had relaxing retinotomies sparing the entire temporal quadrant. The use of a radial relaxing retinotomy also was associated with lower final visual acuity. The length of the relaxing retinotomy or the placement of the relaxing retinotomy either anterior or posterior to the encircling scleral buckle did not appear to influence the anatomic or visual results. Hypotony (intraocular pressure less than 5 mmHg) was seen in 43% of reattached eyes.\r"

The visual and angiographic outcomes were analyzed in 156 patients (82 untreated eyes; 81 treated eyes) with occult neovascularization who were followed for 1 to 8 years. Early laser treatment decreased visual acuity to less than 20/200 in 31 of the treated eyes (38%) compared with 20 of the untreated eyes (25%). Three years after the onset of symptoms, 24 treated eyes (29%) and 31 eyes untreated eyes (38%) retained 20/50 visual acuity or better, whereas their respective initial visual acuities were not statistically different. Severe loss of vision (6 or more lines of visual acuity) occurred in 43 treated eyes (53%) and in 33 untreated eyes (40%) at the end of follow-up (range, 12-84 months). A slow and gradual increase of the disciform lesion was demonstrated on fluorescein angiography in 60 untreated eyes, with subfoveal involvement noted in 39 eyes at the end of follow-up. In the treated group, subfoveal involvement occurred in 53 eyes, after a relatively short time (mean, 4 months). Only 28 of the 81 treated eyes had successful anatomic results. These findings suggested that laser treatment of occult neovascularization immediately after the onset of symptoms should not be recommended.\r"

Immediately sight-threatening retinitis presented in six patients (9%) with peripapillary disease; primary foveal infection was not observed. Eighty-seven percent of patients were treated with ganciclovir. Thirty-nine patients (58%) presented with unilateral disease and contralateral infection developed in 15% of those while on ganciclovir. Smoldering (incompletely responsive) retinitis was seen in 33% of the 21 patients whose retinitis progressed while receiving ganciclovir. Progression of treated retinitis was associated with a lower lymphocyte count (P = 0.04). Median survival after diagnosis of CMV retinitis was 8 months. This represents the largest reported prospective study of CMV retinitis and indicates that (1) CMV infrequently poses an immediate threat to vision on presentation, (2) response to therapy may be related to immune function, and (3) smoldering retinitis should be recognized as an important clinical entity associated with treatment failure.\r"

The fourth group had parents present at bedtime and the children did not listen to a recorded story. Hypotheses were tested with three dependent variables: a) length of sleep onset latency (SOL), b) incidence of distress, and c) self-soothing behaviors. Length of SOL on Night 2, adjusted for Night 1 length of SOL and observer, showed significant treatment effects. The parent-recorded story group had significantly longer SOL than the other three groups. The group with parents present at bedtime had significantly longer SOL than the no-story group which was not significantly different from the stranger-recorded story group. Distress behaviors on Night 2, adjusted for distress on Night 1, age, and observer, showed significant differences between groups. The parent-recorded story group had a higher incidence of distress behaviors than the other groups; the difference between the parent-recorded and the stranger-recorded group was significant. No significant differences between groups were seen in self-soothing behaviors.\r"

Subjects were 22 healthy preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit who had reached 31-35 weeks postconceptional age, and whose average weight was 1,482 grams at the onset of the study. Infants were placed on a waterbed for 3 consecutive days and on a standard incubator mattress for 3 consecutive days. Infants served as their own controls on and off the waterbed. Treatment order was randomly counterbalanced. One-hour observations of activity and state occurring in conjunction with heartbeat counts were the repeated measures on each day over both treatment and control conditions. Infants experienced longer durations of quiet sleep, less active awake and fuss states, and fewer state changes and awakenings while on the waterbed. Heart rates were higher after infants were taken off the waterbed. The findings suggest that nonoscillating waterbed flotation is a simple, cost-effective intervention that reduces energy expenditure.\r"

The original research involving two samples, each consisting of 30 medical-surgical patients in a military medical facility, revealed that in addition to being informed, patients found control through fulfilling the patient role, being involved in decision-making processes, and directing interpersonal and environmental interactions (Dennis, 1987). Through a similar use of Q-methodology, this sample of 30 adults, hospitalized with a greater diversity of medical-surgical diagnosis in a civilian medical center, demonstrated control-related perspectives that were similar to their military medical center counterparts. Information about diagnosis, treatment, and the lifestyle implications of the disease process was central to facilitating patients' sense of control. Data from the 90 subjects comprising all three subsamples across both studies were integrated through second-order factor analysis, a procedure unique to Q-methodology. This analysis clarified and confirmed four types of patient control orientations: patient role fulfillment, health care decision making, personal integrity preservation, and global self-determination.\r"

The 14 nursing practices used in the study met the criteria established by the 1982 Conduct and Utilization of Research in Nursing (CURN) Project. The Nursing Practice Questionnaire (NPQ) developed by Brett (1987) to explore nurses' stage of innovation adoption was sent to a random sample of nurses in 10 medium sized hospitals throughout North Carolina; 113 nurses responded. The majority of the sample were aware of 9 of the 14 nursing practices. The percentage who were aware of individual practices ranged from 28% to 93.8%. Eight of the 14 practices were used regularly by more than half of the sample.\r"

Ionic contrast media were administered in 169,284 cases (50.1%) and nonionic contrast media in 168,363 cases (49.9%). The overall prevalence of ADRs was 12.66% in the ionic contrast media group and 3.13% in the nonionic contrast media group. Severe ADRs occurred in 0.22% of the ionic and 0.04% of the nonionic contrast media examinations. One death occurred in each group, but a causal relationship to the contrast medium could not be established. It is concluded that nonionic contrast media significantly reduce the frequency of severe and potentially life-threatening ADRs to contrast media at all levels of risk and that use of these media represents the most effective means of increasing the safety of contrast media examinations.\r"

One hundred cases (5%) involved radiologists, and 10 of these were related to the use of contrast media. Four of the cases reached financial settlement before trial, three were dropped with no financial settlement before tribunal or trial, one was dropped after a tribunal finding for the defendants, and two were decided in favor of the defendants at trial. Multiple issues were raised by the plaintiffs in all 10 cases. The questions of quality of care and of informed consent were raised in 10 and nine cases, respectively. In the four cases that reached a financial settlement, quality of care was thought to be an important issue in three, whereas informed consent was not a key issue in any. Conversely, adequate informed consent was an important consideration in three of the six cases that were dropped. Screening of patients and documentation of risk factors, adverse events, treatment, and follow-up were also important factors in determining outcome. The authors conclude that legal claims relating to use of contrast agents are unusual, most often involve non-life-threatening outcomes, and in most cases do not result in trial or a financial settlement.\r"

Magnetic resonance images of the heart and relaxation data were obtained in 19 rats, and another three rats were used for measurements of contrast material concentration in the heart, with the contrast agent enriched with iron-59. A dose of 36 mumols of iron per kilogram induced homogeneous signal loss in the myocardium with a gated spin-echo sequence with a repetition time of 1,500 msec and an echo time of 20 msec. The reduction in signal intensity was the result of a combination of diffusion-dependent and diffusion-independent T2 shortening. The diffusion effect results from dephasing of spins moving across magnetic field gradients generated in the tissue by the contrast agent. The relative contribution of the diffusion-induced signal loss observed in vivo was larger than that predicted from the in vitro relaxation measurements. The reduced in vitro effect is likely the result of loss of a portion of the intramyocardial blood volume during sample preparation, as assessed with the Fe-59 measurements.\r"

Thirteen patients had undergone several unsuccessful surgical repairs, and four had not undergone surgery because of their clinical status. All patients had already undergone multiple percutaneous balloon dilations without success. Stents were placed percutaneously, through a transhepatic approach, without complications. Adequate caliber of the strictured segment, stable relief of symptoms, and normalization of liver function tests were achieved in 14 patients (82.4%). Partial primary success was obtained in one patient; initial success was achieved in two patients, but strictures recurred after 5 months. The average follow-up period was 8 months. Results suggest that placement of these stents might represent a permanent therapeutic solution for intractable recurrences. Extended follow-up and experimental studies to clarify long-term patency and biotolerance are needed.\r"

The thrombogenicities of hydrophilically coated catheters and noncoated nylon catheters were compared with and without the use of heparin. Carotid arteries, jugular veins, femoral arteries, and femoral veins were used. Catheters were left in place for 45 minutes. The animals were heparinized and killed. The vessels were then removed en bloc with the catheter clamped in place. The vessels were incised, and the clot was removed and weighed. In arterial and venous catheterization, no significant difference in clot deposition was shown between the hydrophilically coated catheters and the noncoated nylon catheters. A striking reduction of thrombogenicity was achieved with heparinization of the catheters in both arteries and veins.\r"

It was shown that PCC can be accomplished with a variety of techniques (e.g. Seldinger or trocar puncture, tacking) and instruments (various types and sizes of retention and nonretention catheters). Anatomic studies revealed that the cecum is surrounded by the peritoneum for as much as 270 degrees of its circumference, so that a retroperitoneal approach to PCC would probably be unfeasible in most patients. PCC was effective in treating all five patients in this study, despite their advanced age and complicated medical conditions. Decompression of colonic gas was achieved with 8-12-F catheters, and no major complications occurred. Endoscopic decompression had been unsuccessfully attempted in four of the patients previously. It is concluded that PCC may be an important option in the treatment of Ogilvie syndrome and that the procedure may obviate surgery and be lifesaving in certain high-risk patients.\r"

Mean pelvic venous enhancement was maximal between 3 and 7 minutes in all the patients. Venous attenuation changes did not correlate with the presence of cardiac or peripheral vascular disease, but there was significantly less enhancement in patients with diabetes mellitus. The time of maximum vein enhancement begins at 3 minutes and continues for at least 4 minutes. A delayed technique of scanning the pelvis may be preferable to rapid scanning to optimize enhancement of the pelvic veins.\r"

However, a retrospective review of double-contrast barium enema studies in 22 patients with 31 pathologically proved hyperplastic polyps revealed an average polyp size of 7.3 mm, with a range of 3-21 mm. Fifteen polyps (48%) were 2-5 mm, 12 (39%) were 6-10 mm, and four (13%) were greater than 10 mm in diameter. Twenty-nine polyps (94%) were sessile, and two polyps (6%) were pedunculated. Twenty-three polyps (74%) had a smooth contour, and eight polyps (26%) were lobulated. Twenty-six of the hyperplastic polyps (84%) were located in the rectosigmoid colon. If the radiologic criteria for an atypical hyperplastic polyp at double-contrast barium enema examination include size greater than 5 mm, lobulation, and/or pedunculation, 16 of the 31 hyperplastic polyps (52%) could be classified as atypical. Thus, radiologists should be aware that many hyperplastic polyps seen at double-contrast barium enema examination do not fit the classic description of a smooth, sessile elevation less than 5 mm in size but instead appear as larger, more lobulated lesions that are indistinguishable from adenomatous polyps.\r"

MR imaging was performed at 0.6 and 1.5 T in 15 volunteers. Images of the upper abdomen and pelvis were obtained before and after ingestion of the contrast material at doses of 22.5-225.0 mg of iron in 600-900 L. Two readers scored the images. Delivery of contrast material into the proximal and distal small bowel, with obvious loss of signal intensity (T2 enhancement), was achieved in all subjects. Enhanced images showed improved delineation of the head and tail of the pancreas, anterior margins of the kidneys, and paraaortic region. The contrast agent did not generate artifacts, an improvement over prototype formulations evaluated previously in animals. Except for a brief episode of diarrhea in five subjects, the agent was well tolerated. Use of this contrast agent improved the diagnostic quality of abdominal MR images by enabling the distinction of the bowel from nonbowel structures at concentrations that did not produce image distortion.\r"

Of the 13 patients with hepatic hydatidosis, four had secondary peritoneal lesions, and one also had involvement of the dorsal spine. The presence of a hypointense rim and a multiloculated or multicystic appearance are distinctive features. When evaluating the viability of hydatid cysts the authors found that MR imaging findings were not particularly valuable, as the MR imaging signs (daughter cysts and detachment of the membranes) are rare and are also evident at computed tomography and ultrasound examinations. T2 measurements were not useful due to the wide range of values obtained. Despite these limitations, MR imaging is still an important technique in the study of echinococcosis to depict the presence of a rim as a characteristic sign and to obtain a complete anatomic evaluation.\r"

Parenchymal disease was categorized as either bilateral or unilateral, symmetric or asymmetric, and diffuse or patchy. Infiltrates were classified as interstitial, airspace, or mixed. On this basis, three CT patterns of involvement were identified: a ground-glass patchwork pattern in 22 of 39 (56%), and an interstitial pattern in seven of 39 patients (18%). Atypical CT features of PCP included nodules and nodular components in seven of 39 (18%) and cavities in three of 39 patients (8%). Associated CT findings included cystic spaces and bullae in 15 of 39 (38%), pneumothorax in five of 39 (13%), adenopathy in seven of 39 (18%), and pleural effusions in seven of 39 patients (18%). It is concluded that although PCP may exhibit a variety of CT appearances, certain patterns are more common than others. In the appropriate clinical setting, these findings are highly suggestive of PCP. The identification of cavities or nodular components in addition to infiltrates should raise the suspicion of a second disease process or mixed infection affecting the lungs.\r"

Twenty-three patients were receiving monthly prophylaxis with 300 mg of aerosolized pentamidine by means of inhalation; the other 41 were not receiving pentamidine and served as a control group. Parenchymal abnormalities were present in 63 of 64 patients. Pleural effusion and cystic lung lesions were uncommon and did not differ between the two groups. Patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine were more likely than control patients to have disease isolated or predominant in the upper lobes (odds ratio = 3.9, confidence interval = 1.1-14.1). After the possible effects of confounding variables were taken into account, prophylaxis remained a significant risk factor. Age and a previous history of P carinii pneumonia were not significant cofactors. The pattern of deposition or retention of the aerosolized pentamidine could be responsible for the finding of predominant P carinii pneumonia in the upper lobes of the lungs.\r"

The radiologic features of pyogenic pulmonary infection included lobar consolidation, nodules, infiltrates with pleural effusions, round infiltrates, and pleural effusions alone. These features are uncommon in PCP. The chest radiograph may be highly suggestive of a pyogenic process, especially when it shows local consolidation or nodules. Since bacterial pneumonias have a more favorable outcome, it is concluded that the radiologic features should be the primary guide to prompt diagnosis and treatment.\r"

At each of five levels, in addition to routine scans obtained at 120 kVp and 140 mA, a scan at 10 mA and a half scan at 10 mA were obtained, with all other parameters held constant. Each scan was evaluated visually to assess anatomic clarity as well as the presence of artifacts and the extent of graininess. At all levels of the thorax, visualization of parenchymal structures was not affected by decreasing the milliamperage. It appears that high-quality, diagnostic images of the lung can be obtained with a very low radiation dose. Although further evaluation is necessary, the potential of low-dose CT for use in the pediatric population in particular, as well as for screening in patients at high risk for developing lung cancer, is apparent.\r"

Test images with higher spatial frequency were ranked better than those with lower spatial frequency and the acceptable upper limit of the compression ratio was 19:1. In studies of receiver operating characteristics for scoring the presence or absence of nodules and linear shadows, the images with a compression ratio of 25:1 showed a statistical difference as compared with the other images with a compression ratio of 20:1 or less. Both studies show that plain CR chest images with a compression ratio of 10:1 are acceptable and, with use of an improved DCT technique, the upper limit of the compression ratio is 20:1.\r"

Responses were received from 834 hospitals (42%). Of these, 450 were reported to conduct pediatric CT with sedation. Approximately one-half of the examinations were conducted in pediatric hospitals or medical schools. Most hospitals did not require signed consent for CT with light sedation, even when intravenously or orally administered contrast medium was used. Signed consent for CT with deep sedation was required in 62% of hospitals. Monitoring techniques and personnel present during CT with sedation varied greatly, as did oral intake protocols for examinations with oral contrast material or no contrast material. Use of intubation during CT with oral contrast medium was rare. Orally administered chloral hydrate was the most frequently used first-line drug for sedation in most types of CT studies. The great variation in practices indicates a lack of settled standards for sedation during pediatric diagnostic examinations. Many procedures reported for pediatric CT with sedation are at variance with recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\r"

Developmental coxa vara, simulated corner fractures of long tubular bones, and vertebral body abnormalities result in a diagnostic constellation. Knowledge of these distinctive radiologic features allows accurate diagnosis, which in turn should lead to appropriate genetic counseling and possibly to earlier, more efficacious surgical treatment of the coxa vara.\r"

Gadolinium enhancement indicated the development of vascularity through the plate, which preceded the formation of a bony bridge. Enhancement was faint at 4 days after surgery, was inhomogeneous at 1 week, was maximal at 2 weeks, and decreased at 3 weeks and beyond as the lesion was replaced by bone. A dark rim representing bone deposition at the periphery of the lesion was seen at 2 weeks. At 4 weeks and beyond, the bridge was seen as a dark band of dense bone or as a wider area that was isointense with adjacent fatty marrow. Abnormality in the cartilage and development of transphyseal vascularity, which precede the formation of a bony bridge after trauma, can be detected with MR imaging.\r"

A limitation to general acceptance of MR imaging of the knee has been availability and cost. The recent introduction of low-field-strength MR imaging has shown promise in decreasing the cost and increasing the availability of this modality. High-resolution (pixel size, 0.7 mm2), three-dimensional Fourier transform (3DFT), thin-section (3.5 mm) imaging performed on a 0.064-T permanent magnet was used to evaluate 117 knees in 114 consecutive patients. The appearance of normal anatomy and internal derangements of the knee at low-field-strength imaging is described. Arthroscopic correlation was available for 28 knees. Findings from low-field-strength MR imaging and arthroscopy agreed in 79% of cases in the determination of meniscal tears. Partial-flip-angle techniques with 3DFT produced thin-section images of the knee of diagnostic quality. The authors conclude that in patients with internal derangements of the knee, low-field-strength (0.064-T) MR imaging may provide useful information.\r"

Osteoblastoma is usually a lytic lesion originating in the medulla of bones with matrix ossification and mild surrounding sclerosis. Osteoblastoma of the spine demonstrated better tumor delineation in the vertebrae, and a bony rim on the soft-tissue side was seen less frequently than previously observed. Osteoblastoma of the talus frequently appears as a blister on the surface of the bone and is accompanied by osteoporosis. In the hands and feet, the radiographic appearance is often very similar to that of aneurysmal bone cyst and giant cell tumor. In the skull it strongly resembles a button sequestrum of bone. The origin and extent of the tumor, the presence of matrix mineralization, and tumor delineation depicted as a thin bony shell are often better appreciated on computed tomographic (CT) scans. In addition, CT can demonstrate both edema and atrophy of the surrounding soft tissues. At magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, osteoblastoma demonstrates signal intensities similar to those of other bone neoplasms. In addition to the advantages offered by CT, MR imaging can help differentiate tumor tissue from accompanying edema.\r"

Morphologic findings were compared with quantitative analysis of temporal changes in signal intensity. Dynamic postcontrast images of the normal kidney demonstrated four phases of enhancement; cortical enhancement phase, early tubular phase, ductal phase, and excretory phase. The pattern of enhancement in dilated nonobstructed kidneys was similar to that in normal kidneys. In acutely obstructed kidneys, cortical enhancement was similar to that in normal kidneys (17% increase), but medullary enhancement was higher than normal, resulting in diminished corticomedullary differentiation. The early tubular phase was prolonged (until 2.5 minutes after injection), with delayed appearance of the ductal and excretory phases. In chronically obstructed kidneys, the increase in cortical intensity was less than that in normal kidneys (13% increase).

Observations are based principally on magnetic resonance (MR) images. When disk fragments moved in a superior (42%) or inferior (40%) direction from the donor disk, the displaced disk components were most frequently (94%) dislodged into the right or left half of the anterior epidural space (AES) and rarely straddled the midline. To explain this phenomenon, the authors investigated the anatomy of the AES by dissecting four cadaver specimens and reviewing 300 MR images of the spine. They conclude that the migrating path of a disk fragment is determined by the anatomy of the AES, a fairly well-defined space delimited posteriorly by the posterior longitudinal ligament and by membranes laterally attached to it. It consists of two compartments separated by a sagitally aligned septum. During migration, sequestered disk fragments usually stay in these compartments.\r"

Twenty-seven percent of the control group and 57% of the symptomatic patients without masses or MS showed vessel contact with the root entry zone of the preganglionic segment of the fifth cranial nerve. Vessel contact in the symptomatic groups was generally indistinguishable from that seen in the normal group. Fifteen percent of the patients had MS or masses.

Spinal cord abnormalities were seen in 48 patients according to five patterns: (a) normal signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images (pattern N/N, n = 28), (b) normal signal intensity on T1-weighted and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (pattern N/Hi, n = 18), (c) hypointensity on T1-weighted and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (pattern Lo/Hi, n = 17), (d) cord atrophy (n = 5), and (e) longitudinal syrinx formation with hypointensity on T1- and hyperintensity or isointensity on T2-weighted images (n = 8). Patients with pattern N/N had only slight neurologic damage and an excellent prognosis. Patients with pattern N/Hi had mild neurologic impairment, frequently associated with cord compression. Patients with pattern Lo/Hi had the worst prognosis. Atrophy was observed in patients with a long history of myelopathy.\r"

  ".W": "The ferromagnetism of various bullets and shotgun pellets was tested in vitro. Magnetic deflection showed that four of 21 metallic specimens tested (all bullets) demonstrated marked ferromagnetism. Three of these four were made outside the United States; two of the four were known to contain steel, and the other two were reportedly either copper or copper-nickel-jacketed lead bullets (indicating that the ferromagnetism was due to impurities in the bullet jackets or cores). Ferromagnetic bullets readily rotated within a gelatin phantom in response to magnetic torque. Nonferromagnetic bullets and pellets demonstrated only mild to moderate metal artifact during spin-echo and gradient-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, all four of the ferromagnetic bullets produced severe MR artifacts and image distortion. MR studies of seven patients with retained bullets, pellets, or shrapnel were reviewed. In six of the seven, only mild MR artifacts were seen. Only intracranial shrapnel (presumably steel) in one patient created significant artifact. All seven patients with retained bullets and shotgun pellets were imaged safely with MR. However, caution should be exercised with MR imaging in the presence of metallic foreign bodies, particularly if they are located near vital neural, vascular, or soft-tissue structures.\r"

Differentiation of true stenosis from artifactual signal loss, due to dephasing effects from fast or nonconstant blood flow and field inhomogeneities, poses a significant clinical problem that can be largely resolved with the use of very short echo times (TEs). A three-dimensional imaging technique was developed that allows TEs of 3.1 msec without and 4.5 msec with first-order flow compensation gradients. The short TEs were achieved with short asymmetric radio-frequency pulses, gradients of minimal duration, and fractional echoes. Significantly improved images of normal tortuous vessels with fast flow were obtained. With this method, accuracy in depicting the vessel lumen and confidence in the findings were markedly increased.\r"

The overall actuarial survival rate was 86.5% at 5 years and 78.0% at 10 years. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 70.2%. Survival rates depended on locoregional tumor extension. Patients with stage I tumors had a survival rate of 92.0% at 5 years and 84.0% at 10 years; patients with stage II tumors had a survival rate of 82.0% at 5 years and 75.0% at 10 years. The percentage of patients with local recurrences was 13.0% for all patients (10.8% for stage I and 16.1% for stage II patients). The percentage of patients with lymph node recurrences was 1.5% for all patients (1.3% for stage I and 1.9% for stage II patients). The percentage of patients with distant metastases was 11.2% for all patients (7.8% for stage I and 16.1% for stage II patients). Locoregional control rates compared favorably with those in the literature. Breast preservation rates at 5 years were 85.0% for stage I and 80.9% for stage II patients. Cosmetic results were judged good by physicians in 80% of patients and by 90% of the patients themselves. Complication rates were very low.\r"

In most patients, measurements were made during the 1st week of radiation therapy, after port radiographs were obtained to ensure proper field position and accurate alignment of the posterior tangential field edges. Phantom measurements were made simultaneously with TLD measurements to systematically assess the scatter dose as a function of the wedging, number of fields, type of accelerator, beam energy, and bolus used in each treatment. For most patients, the scatter dose to the contralateral breast at a point on the skin 5 cm outside the edge of the medial beam was 8%-13% of the prescribed dose. However, higher doses (up to 36% of the therapeutic dose) were recorded in some patients.\r"

The 3' UTR formed a complex in vitro with a component of S100 extracts from wild-type cells. This binding activity was not detectable in S100 extracts from cells that expressed CK activity after transformation with the 3' UTR-containing vector. These results suggest that translation of CK-B is repressed by binding of a soluble factor or factors to the 3' UTR.\r"

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain protein was found within macrophages in all stages of lesion development in both human and nonhuman primate atherosclerosis. Thus macrophages may play a critical role in the disease by providing PDGF, a potent chemotactic and growth-stimulatory molecule, to the intimal smooth muscle cells.\r"

Such a system would also be of great value for AIDS vaccine research. An infectious molecular clone of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was identified that induces AIDS in common rhesus monkeys in a time frame suitable for laboratory investigation. These results provide another strong link in the chain of evidence for the viral etiology of AIDS. More importantly, they define a system for molecular dissection of the determinants of AIDS pathogenesis.\r"

The neural mechanisms that underlie such synergistic muscle activations have been a matter of considerable experimentation and debate. In order to investigate this issue, the projections of a class of primate premotoneuronal cells were studied, namely, the vertical medium-lead burst neurons (VMLBs), which drive vertical rapid eye movements. Axons of upward VMLBs ramify bilaterally within motoneuron pools that supply the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles of both eyes. Axons of downward VMLBs ramify ipsilaterally in the inferior rectus portion of the oculomotor nucleus and in the trochlear nucleus. Thus, VMLBs can drive vertical motoneuron pools of both eyes during conjugate vertical rapid eye movements; these data support Hering's law.\r"

Review of those seven medical records and Vibrio case investigation forms showed that although all patients died of sepsis, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms characterized the early illness in four patients, whereas the other three initially had painful swelling and/or lesions of the lower extremities. All patients had preexisting chronic diseases. Five patients (71%) had eaten seafood during the week before oneset of illness, including four (57%) who had eaten raw oysters. To reduce the risk of acquiring Vibrio infections, raw or undercooked seafood should be eliminated from the diet, particularly by persons with underlying chronic diseases.\r"

Holter monitors were placed on eight patients receiving ritodrine tocolysis and eight control patients for 24 hours to make continuous electrocardiographic records. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms, serum glucose, and electrolyte concentrations were monitored serially in all patients. Four of the eight patients receiving ritodrine tocolysis demonstrated ST segment depression, while none of the control patients manifested any electrocardiographic abnormalities. The observed ST segment depression appears to be related to the degree of maternal tachycardia and the level of hypokalemia and hyperglycemia that occurs during early ritodrine tocolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-three anterior staple capsulorrhaphies of the shoulder were reviewed at an average 49.7 months postoperatively (range 12 to 127 months); one postoperative dislocation occurred. The patients' quality of athletic participation improved with surgical therapy in 50%, remained the same in 38%, and was lowered in 12%. Average loss of external rotation was 11.4 degrees with the arm adducted and 13.9 degrees with the arm abducted 90 degrees. A positive apprehension sign persisted in 50%. Shoulder function was good or excellent in 84%. Mild pain was admitted by 55%, moderate pain by 6%, and severe pain by 3%. Staple malpositioning or loosening was identified in 12 shoulders; six of these patients had attributable clinical problems. Biomechanical studies in porcine bone were used to demonstrate that predrilling facilitates proper staple positioning without compromising staple fixation strength and, in a synthetic trabecular model, that a 5 degrees variance in the alignment of the staple holder during staple insertion weakens the fixation strength by 51% (P less than .001). The operation usually prevents recurrent dislocation, permits recovery of normal (or near normal) shoulder motion, and allows satisfactory return to competitive athletics. If staple malpositioning and loosening occur, they may cause clinical problems, including degenerative arthritis. Though most patients (92%) stated they would again have the operation, when practical, we recommend other methods of repair of capsule and labral detachment.\r"

The three groups were comparable in their pretreatment characteristics. Of patients treated with surgical decompression followed by radiotherapy, 45% showed improvement in motor deficit; of patients treated with either surgery or radiotherapy, 18% (P = .06) and 16% (P = .02) showed improvement, respectively. These results were most significant in patients with paraparesis, where 47% of those who received combined therapy improved compared to 17% (P = .06) and 9% (P = .009) in the surgical and radiotherapy groups, respectively. In our series of patients with spinal cord compression due to metastatic tumor, surgical decompression followed by radiotherapy was superior to either surgical decompression or radiotherapy in improving motor deficit.\r"

Two or more movement disorders coexisted in 31 patients (25%). Functional disability was more severe in patients with akathisia than in other patients. Women outnumbered men at a ratio of 4:1, except for tardive dystonia which affected both sexes equally. The average at onset was 56 years (range, 13 to 87); 69 patients (55%) had onset of movement disorder in the sixth decade. While tardive dystonia was distributed relatively evenly in all age groups, almost a third of patients with parkinsonism had it in the eighth decade. Haloperidol was implicated in 47 patients (37%), followed by amitriptyline/perphenazine in 30%, thioridazine in 27%, and chlorpromazine in 20%. Metoclopramide-induced movement disorders were found in 10 (8%). Most patients (101 or 81%) had history of psychiatric illnesses, but of these only 44 had psychosis. Neuroleptic drugs had been prescribed for 33 patients (26%) who had gastrointestinal problems. It is important to recognize and differentiate various drug-induced movement disorders because such differentiation has pathophysiologic and therapeutic implications. Many patients could have been treated with less potent drugs.\r"

The major clinical evidence of this interference is fetal bone defect caused by oral anticoagulants given to the mother during the first trimester of pregnancy. No bone abnormalities have been reported so far in adults receiving oral anticoagulants. We studied 56 women who had had cardiac valve replacement and who were given acenocoumarol as anticoagulant, and 61 age-matched women who were in the same New York Heart Association functional class but who were not taking anticoagulants. Osteocalcin serum levels were comparable between the two groups; bone density values measured at appendicular bone were significantly lower in patients taking acenocoumarol. No significant correlation was found between duration of treatment and bone density. Significant osteopenia was present in the women being treated with oral anticoagulants.\r"

Patients with financial barriers scored significantly lower than control subjects on the psychologic function/mental health component of the functional status questionnaire and tended to score lower on all other functional status measures. The results suggest that poor patients with financial barriers to recommended medical care may be sicker than other poor patients.\r"

When considering a patient with fever, changing murmur, major systemic emboli, or splenomegaly, and with blood cultures negative for organisms months or even years after cardiac surgery, therefore, the physician should maintain a high index of suspicion for fungal endocarditis. The best opportunity to establish the diagnosis antemortem rests in careful histopathologic and microbiologic examination of infected emboli and vegetations. Most authors agree that a combined approach employing early valve replacement and aggressive antifungal chemotherapy with amphotericin B and perhaps flucytosine or rifampin represents the best option for treatment of endovascular Aspergillus infections.\r"

We recently treated two patients with augmented bladders whose pregnancies were complicated by multiple infections of the urinary tract, urinary calculi and incontinence. One patient with an artificial genitourinary sphincter had malfunction of the device during the later stages of pregnancy; it resolved after birth. In the second patient, pyelonephritis may have led to premature delivery. Patients with these conditions must be observed for deterioration of renal function, obstruction of the urinary tract and infection throughout the pregnancy. In patients with augmentation and reconstruction of the vesical neck, we recommend delivery by cesarean section because of the potential for disruption of the continence mechanism.\r"

Of these patients, 45.3 per cent had lymph nodal metastases, and of a total of 10,130 dissected lymph nodes, 13.0 per cent had metastases. The present findings suggest that both the number and frequency of lymph nodal metastases are closely related to other prognostic factors, such as depth of invasion, histologic type, gross findings, histologic staging and vascular invasion. The five year survival rate significantly decreased as the number and frequency of metastases increased. Thus, it appears the number and frequency of involved lymph nodes are parameters of prognostic significance.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotriene B4, a potent neutrophil chemotactic factor, is also made by the neutrophil. Neutrophil function was studied in 12 patients at risk for the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after admission to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) to test the hypothesis that increased generation by the neutrophil generation of this mediator precedes the development of pulmonary failure. Peripheral blood neutrophils were tested for chemotaxis to f-met-leu-phe (fMLP) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and the generation of LTB4. Plasma was collected simultaneously for assay of C3a desArg levels. Five patients had ARDS a mean of 2.2 +/- 0.25 days after admission to the ICU. Neutrophil generation of LTB4 was significantly enhanced on ICU day 1 in these patients as compared with patients at risk for ARDS but not developing the syndrome (119.4 +/- 6.1 versus 101.0 +/- 5.1, per cent control, p less than 0.05). Chemotaxis to fMLP and LTB4 was significantly reduced in both groups of patients. However, neutrophil chemotaxis improved in patients who did not have pulmonary failure during the time in the ICU, whereas neutrophil chemotactic responsiveness worsened in patients who did have pulmonary failure. Plasma C3a desArg levels were significantly elevated over normal laboratory values on ICU day 1 in the ARDS patients (317.2 +/- 74.0 versus 132.0 +/- 16.0 milligrams per milliliter, p less than 0.01). These data indicate that LTB4 production by the neutrophil occurs concomitantly with complement activation, is a predictor of subsequent ARDS and may play a significant role in the development of pulmonary failure in critically ill surgical patients.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-one patients underwent anterior resection with curative (n = 57) or palliative (n = 24) intent for tumors below 7 centimeters from the anal verge. If a right angled clamp could be applied below the tumor at operation after full mobilization of the mesorectum and rectum, the procedure was performed in preference to abdominoperineal excision. The mean follow-up time was 4.8 years. Of the curative group, 26 had lesions within 5 centimeters of the anal verge. Thirty-one per cent were Dukes' A; 37 per cent, B, and 32 per cent, C lesions. The margin of distal clearance ranged from 2 to 35 millimeters. In five patients, squamous mucosa was observed in the distal doughnut. Serious postoperative complications occurred in 17 per cent of the curative series, one-half of which occurred within the first two years of the study period. In six patients, the temporary colostomy has not been closed. The incidence of local recurrence in the curative series was 3.5 per cent, and the over-all survival rate was 81 per cent at five years. Full continence was achieved within two years of closure of the colosomy in 85 per cent of the patients. In the palliative group, 11 of the 19 patients had temporary colostomies and 80 per cent were continent within six months of operation. The technique of total mesorectal excision and sphincter preservation by stapled coloanal anastomosis in the treatment of carcinomas of the lower one-third of the rectum may be an alternative to abdominoperineal excision. The final decision in such instances is made intraoperatively. The operative and functional results are satisfactory, but it is difficult to anticipate the patients who will not do well by preoperative criteria. Even in palliative procedures, low anterior resections provided satisfactory continence. Serious postoperative complications were more likely to occur if full mobilization of the splenic flexture was not routinely performed.\r"

  ".W": "The safety of carotid endarterectomy in the community hospital has been questioned when compared with the morbidity and mortality in the university hospital setting. The results of 272 carotid endarterectomies consecutively performed during a 41 month period by one fellowship-trained vascular surgeon at two small community hospitals are reported in this retrospective study. Of the procedures, 234 (86 per cent) were performed for symptomatic lesions and 38 (14 per cent) for asymptomatic high-grade (greater than 50 per cent) stenoses. There were eight postoperative strokes and one early death for a combined morbidity and mortality rate of 3.3 per cent. Transient neurologic deficits included five patients with a transient ischemic attack lasting less than 24 hours and one patient with a reversible ischemic neurologic deficit lasting less than 72 hours. No postoperative strokes or deaths occurred in the 38 procedures done upon asymptomatic patients. These results suggest that an appropriately trained vascular surgeon can safely perform carotid endarterectomy in the community hospital setting when the operation is performed with optimum support from the anesthesiologist and perioperative monitoring. Both electroencephalographic monitoring and cerebral stump pressures were used. There was no statistically significant difference in stroke rates in those patients who were monitored and who underwent a shunt procedure on the basis of the electroencephalogram versus those who underwent shunting procedures on the basis of carotid stump pressures, although a trend was suggested.\r"

This was done to determine if the methods of therapy continue to yield low complication rates and zero mortality rates. The routine use of antibiotic coverage for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in perforated appendicitis resulted in low complication rates, 3.2 per cent for major and 2.5 per cent for minor complications. Major complications included small intestinal obstruction and intra-abdominal abscess. Minor complications included wound infection and prolonged ileus. These rates are similar to those of the first investigation. The mortality rate continued to be zero. Complete peritoneal lavage was used in patients with generalized peritonitis or extensive localized peritonitis. Operative lysis of adhesions for small intestinal obstruction was required in four of these patients. This did not occur in patients with perforated appendicitis with abscess formation or more localized peritonitis who had no lavage. The technique rather than the disease process may be responsible for the complication.\r"

Cholecystostomy is often criticized as an inferior operation, because it provides some palliation but leaves the patient with most problems unattended. To re-evaluate the role of cholecystostomy in the management of acute disease of the gallbladder, we reviewed our experience with it. During the years 1974 to 1987, 37 patients underwent a cholecystostomy. Patients ranged in age from 58 to 90 years, with an average age of 69 years. Twenty-eight patients had acute destructive cholecystitis, usually complicated by perforation, peritonitis or ascending cholangitis. Five had severe pancreatitis; three, cholelithiasis, and one patient, carcinoma of the bladder. Twenty-seven of the 37 patients had severe systemic disease and were critically ill. At the operation, calculi were extracted and the gallbladder and abscess were drained. Two patients died, yielding a mortality rate of 5.4 per cent. Tube cholangiography was done in 33 patients. Although residual stones were demonstrated in seven patients, the stones were removed electively at a later date under much more favorable conditions. None of the 35 survivors had symptoms of disease of the gallbladder during the follow-up period, which ranged from one to 12 years. Cholecystostomy is a curative operation indicated in critically ill and elderly patients for whom extensive operation is a prohibitive risk.\r"

The utility of readily detecting alterations in CBF is apparent, particularly when applied to the evaluation of therapeutic interventions thought to influence CBF. We report the effects of hypocapnia, an experimental condition of known cerebral vasoconstriction, in ten normal volunteers. Subjects had brain blood flow evaluated utilizing H215O as the positron emitter before and after approximately five minutes of hyperventilation. Baseline CBF was measured as a mean +/- SD of 61.2 +/- 16.3 mL/min/100 g of tissue. Mean baseline arterial blood gas values were PaO2 107.4 +/- 14 mm Hg, PaCO2 37.7 +/- 0.89 mm Hg, and pH 7.39 (calculated from mean [H+]). Post hyperventilation, global CBF was measured as 31.1 +/- 10.8 mL/min/100 g. Mean arterial blood gas values were PaO2 141.7 +/- 21 mm Hg, PaCO2 19.7 +/- 5 mm Hg, and pH 7.63 (calculated from mean [H+]). CBF decreased by a mean of 49.5 +/- 11 percent. Data analysis using the Student's t-test showed a significant change over baseline in PaCO2 (p less than 0.001) and CBF (p less than 0.001), in the hyperventilated state. Correlations were noted between the decrease in CBF and change in PaCO2 (r = 0.81) as well as between hyperventilation PaCO2 and the change in CBF (r = 0.97). We conclude that, as measured by PET, CBF decreases significantly during a state of artificial hyperventilation to a degree consistent with results seen using other methods. PET appears to be a valuable tool in the assessment of interventions that could influence CBF.\r"

The altered metabolism in these patients appeared to correlate with the clinical severity of the disease.

Since knowledge of pathophysiology of AMI may alter subsequent management, angiograms obtained between 1 hour and 7 days of AMI (median 1 day) were reviewed in 50 patients greater than 1 year after CABG. The culprit vessel was identified by the presence of residual stenosis and/or thrombus in the vessel supplying the infarct zone or by reviewing previous angiograms. The infarct vessel was identified as a vein graft in 38 (76%) patients, the native vessel in 8 patients (16%) and could not be accurately determined in 4 patients (8%). Among the 38 vein grafts suspected as the infarct vessel, unequivocal angiographic evidence of residual thrombus (filling defect/persistent staining) was present in 31 (82%) and was greater than 2 cm in length in 15 patients. Successful reperfusion occurred in only 2 of 8 (25%) grafts after intravenous thrombolytic therapy. Intragraft thrombolysis with or without additional angioplasty was successful at restoring flow in 8 of 10 (80%) grafts. Data indicate that in patients who have undergone previous CABG, AMI is usually caused by thrombotic occlusion of a saphenous vein graft and that conventional intravenous thrombolytic therapy may be inadequate to restore flow. The large mass of thrombus and absent flow in the graft may require subselective drug infusion, a higher thrombolytic dose or a mechanical means of recanalization.\r"

This prospective study examined oxygen transport variables in 19 such patients and assessed their responses to treatment. Femoral and pulmonary arterial catheters were inserted before any therapy except correction of hypoxemia by mechanical ventilation in 8 patients, defibrillation (3 patients) or pacing (5 patients). In 3 patients mean arterial pressure was greater than 80 mm Hg and cardiac index greater than 2.1 liters/min/m2 with normal mixed venous oxygen saturation despite simultaneous clinical shock. They recovered with no further treatment. Sixteen patients were treated with varying combinations of intravenous fluids and dobutamine (37 +/- 25 mu/kg/min) and 14 survived long enough for a second set of measurements to be completed. Mean heart rate increased from 83 +/- 22 to 101 +/- 20 beats/min and mean cardiac index from 1.4 +/- 0.5 to 2.5 +/- 0.4 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.001). Oxygen consumption (VO2) was maintained even when oxygen delivery (DO2) was less than 330 ml/min/m2. After treatment DO2 increased from 230 +/- 69 to 397 +/- 60 ml/min/m2 (p less than 0.001) and VO2 from 103 +/- 31 to 124 +/- 27 ml/min/m2 (p less than 0.05). Mean mixed venous oxygen saturation increased from 54 +/- 16 to 69 +/- 8% (p less than 0.001) and mean oxygen extraction ratio decreased from 48 +/- 16 to 31 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001). There was no correlation between cuff systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure before or after resuscitation. Thirteen patients survived to hospital discharge. When cardiogenic shock responds to treatment, large increases in DO2 lead to small increases in VO2 but large increases in mixed venous oxygen saturation, reflecting improved tissue oxygen availability.\r"

The study population was made up of 21 anterior, 30 inferior and 20 posterolateral single myocardial infarction (MI) patients with no evidences of bundle branch or fascicular blocks, ventricular hypertrophy or previous MI on their final stable electrocardiogram. The complete system's maximum 32 points is capable of indicating MI in 96% of the left ventricle and it estimated a mean electrocardiographic MI size that better approximated the anatomic size compared with the simplified version in all MI locations. The correlation between anatomic and electrocardiographic MI size using the complete system was better and statistically significant for the posterolateral MI group (simplified r = 0.55, p less than 0.01 vs complete r = 0.70, p less than 0.0006). Criteria such as Q and S amplitude less than or equal to 0.3 mV in V1 and less than or equal to 0.4 mV in V2 were particularly helpful. This study documents the improved ability provided by the 17 additional non-Q-wave criteria which have been added in the complete version of this scoring system regarding the sizing of infarcts in the region of the left ventricle supplied by the left circumflex artery.\r"

The present study determines if exercise radionuclide angiography can aid in the risk stratification of patients with 1- or 2-vessel CAD and impaired LV function (ejection fraction less than 50%). Sixty-five consecutive patients with these findings were followed for a median duration of 24 months (range 12 to 49). Eleven of the 65 patients (17%) had severely ischemic exercise radionuclide angiograms, defined as: a decrease in ejection fraction with exercise; greater than or equal to 1.0 mm of ST-segment depression; and peak exercise workload less than or equal to 600 kg-m/min. During follow-up 11 patients had initial significant cardiac events: 4 cardiac deaths, 1 cardiac arrest, 4 myocardial infarctions and 2 bypass or angioplasty procedures for unstable angina greater than or equal to 3 months after the exercise study. Four of 11 patients (36%) with severely ischemic exercise radionuclide angiograms had events, compared to 7 of 54 patients (13%) without ischemic radionuclide angiograms. Event-free survival at 18 months was 73% for patients with severe exercise ischemia versus 92% for those without ischemia (p less than 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that severe ischemia on radionuclide angiography was the only variable of several tested that significantly predicted future cardiac events (chi-square = 8.16, p less than 0.005). Among patients with 1- or 2-vessel CAD and impaired resting LV function, severe ischemia on exercise radionuclide angiography identifies a subgroup at high risk for future cardiac events.\r"

Thirty patients (17 men and 13 women, mean age 65 years, 19 with and 11 without organic heart disease) with 1 to 28 (mean 5) episodes of syncope of unknown origin were studied. Head-up tilt test was considered positive if syncope developed in association with hypotension, bradycardia, or both. During baseline head-up tilt 15 patients (50%) had a positive response. Ten patients had a vasodepressor response (marked hypotension without marked bradycardia) and 5 had a mixed response (marked hypotension with marked bradycardia). None of 8 control subjects became symptomatic during the test. Baseline head-up tilt test was positively reproducible in 10 of 14 patients (71%). Nine of these 10 patients underwent serial head-up tilt tests after drug administration to determine the pathogenesis of vasovagal syncope. Atropine prevented tilt-induced syncope in 3 of 8 patients (37.5%), propranolol in 2 of 8 (25%) and etilephrine in 7 of 7 (100%). Seven patients received long-term drug treatment with drugs selected on the basis of acute drug testing. One responder to atropine received transdermal scopolamine and 6 received etilephrine. None of these 7 patients had syncopal recurrences or death during a mean follow-up of 12 months. Head-up tilt is a very sensitive and highly specific test to unmask susceptibility to vasovagal reaction in patients with syncope of unknown origin. Withdrawal of alpha-sympathetic stimulation is a principal mechanism responsible for vasodilation and syncope during head-up tilt.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of adding propranolol to procainamide, quinidine, propafenone or disopyramide was prospectively evaluated in 37 patients, all with prior infarction and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT). After showing that VT remained inducible during therapy with a type I drug, 23 patients received intravenous propranolol. The ventricular effective refractory period, prolonged by the type I agent, was further increased by propranolol. The cycle length of the VT also increased after the type I drug and propranolol exaggerated this effect. Seven of the 23 patients were rendered noninducible after propranolol and another 10 manifested a greater than 100 ms increase in induced VT cycle length. In the other 14 patients, propranolol was infused immediately after the basal study. If VT remained inducible, testing was repeated after a type I drug was added. The ventricular effective refractory period, as well as the VT cycle length, increased after propranolol and was further prolonged after the addition of a type I agent. Seven of these 14 patients were rendered noninducible, 3 with propranolol alone and 4 others with the combination, and in 4, the VT cycle length was prolonged by greater than 100 ms. A total of 17 patients were discharged on either propranolol alone (3 patients) or on an effective combination (14 patients). During a mean follow-up of 20 months, 1 patient died suddenly, 2 had recurrence of well-tolerated VT and 9 remain on therapy. Thus, propranolol has a demonstrable antiarrhythmic effect in the invasive laboratory and may supplement the antiarrhythmic efficacy of conventional type I antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

Little is known about the factors responsible for these different responses in man. Previous animal studies have suggested an important role for vasoconstriction mediated by the alpha-adrenergic nervous system. To determine the magnitude and time course of changes in alpha-adrenergic tone during symptomatic sustained monomorphic VT, VT cycle length, mean and phasic arterial pressure, forearm blood flow (by venous occlusion plethysmography) and forearm vascular resistance were measured in 15 patients. Nine of these patients were studied before and after regional intraarterial alpha blockade with phentolamine. After the induction of VT (350 +/- 68 ms), mean forearm blood flow decreased from 3.2 +/- 1.1 to 2.2 +/- 0.8 ml/min/100 ml (p = 0.0002) and the forearm vascular resistance increased from 32 +/- 14 to 40 +/- 14 units (p = 0.01). There were no significant differences for forearm vascular resistance during the first and last 30 seconds of VT (41.3 +/- 14 vs 37 +/- 13 units). After the infusion of intraarterial phentolamine, there were no significant changes in the VT cycle length or mean arterial pressure, but the forearm vascular resistance increase during VT was blunted by 60 to 70%. Most patients with symptomatic VT demonstrate sympathetic vasoconstriction and these changes are maximal during the first 30 seconds of VT. This sympathoexcitatory response is due largely to stimulation of alpha-adrenoreceptors and may be mediated by arterial baroreflexes.\r"

This study assessed electrocardiographic and hemodynamic responses to upright tilt testing (alone or during isoproterenol infusion) before and after disopyramide therapy in 10 patients (age range 16 to 74 years) with recurrent syncopal episodes of neurally mediated origin. Untreated, syncope occurred at less than or equal to 7 minutes of tilt alone (6 patients) or tilt plus isoproterenol at less than or equal to 3 micrograms/min (4 patients) and was associated with hypotension (mean arterial pressure, 40 +/- 16 mm Hg vs baseline 76 +/- 10 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and inappropriate heart rate slowing (mean heart rate, 59 +/- 39 beats/min vs baseline 88 +/- 18 beats/min, p less than 0.005). After oral disopyramide 150 mg 3 times daily (mean plasma level, 3.0 +/- 0.64 micrograms/ml), all patients tolerated 10 minutes of both tilt and tilt plus isoproterenol (maximum dose, 3 micrograms/min) without symptoms, hypotension (mean arterial pressure; tilt 1 min, 79 +/- 7 mm Hg vs tilt 10 min, 77 +/- 8 mm Hg, difference not significant) or bradycardia (mean heart rate; tilt 1 min, 81 +/- 12 beats/min vs tilt 10 min, 83 +/- 11 beats/min, difference not significant). Furthermore, during subsequent 20 +/- 5 months of disopyramide therapy, all but 1 patient remain asymptomatic. Thus, oral disopyramide may be effective for preventing inducible and spontaneous neurally mediated syncope.\r"

Vagal stimulation appears to have a protective effect in animal models of sudden death. The electrophysiologic effects of enhanced vagal activity on right ventricular (RV) refractoriness in man have not been studied previously. The comparative effects of enhanced vagal tone (neck suction to -60 mm Hg) on sinus cycle length and RV refractoriness were assessed in 26 patients. The electrophysiologic effects of vagal activation by stimulation of carotid baroreceptors with neck suction were compared to the effect of carotid and aortic baroreceptor stimulation with phenylephrine infusion in 12 patients. During neck suction, mean sinus cycle length (819 +/- 32 ms) was prolonged by 146 +/- 20 ms (p less than 0.0001). The mean RV effective refractory period (ERP) and functional refractory period (FRP) were prolonged by 4 +/- 1 ms and 5 +/- 1 ms (p = 0.0001 and 0.0002, respectively). The mean change in RV ERP and FRP correlated with the peak change in sinus cycle length during neck suction (r = 0.46 and r = 0.58, respectively). During intravenous phenylephrine infusion, the mean change in RV ERP and FRP was 5 +/- 2 ms (p less than 0.04) and 10 +/- 3 ms (p less than 0.01), respectively. These results show that reflex vagal stimulation with neck suction or phenylephrine infusion causes a small but significant prolongation in RV refractoriness. These findings imply that the potential benefits of enhanced vagal tone in preventing sudden death may be indirectly mediated by changes in ventricular refractoriness.\r"

Because primary arrhythmic events are thought to play an important role in sudden cardiac death, a large series of ventricular stimulation studies was analyzed to determine whether circadian variation in ventricular electrical instability exists. If such a circadian variation could be shown, it could have implications for the conduct and interpretation of electrophysiologic testing and the etiology of circadian variation in sudden cardiac death. Results of 2 drug-free ventricular stimulation studies performed 4 to 28 hours apart in each of 162 patients with coronary artery disease were analyzed. Rate and duration of induced arrhythmia, number of extrastimuli required to induce arrhythmia and changes in these factors between the 2 tests in each patient were analyzed. Comparisons were made by half-day, by hour and in a temporally continuous manner to eliminate errors associated with any single method. No significant circadian variation was found in any electrophysiologic measure of ventricular electrical instability despite adequate statistical power. These findings show that the time of day during which ventricular stimulation tests are performed does not affect test results, and therefore does not need to be controlled during electrophysiologic studies. If these findings are parallel to those in ambulatory patients with coronary artery disease, then circadian changes in ventricular electrical instability may not play as important a role in the circadian pattern of sudden cardiac death as had been previously thought.\r"

Consequently, such measurements are often taken immediately after (within 15 seconds) exercise. To assess the validity of this practice, 18 healthy men (mean age 32 years) who completed 3 progressive 3-minute workloads were studied during arm-crank ergometry. Ankle systolic BP was measured at the dorsalis pedis artery at seated rest, 15 seconds before completion of each exercise stage and immediately after each workload, using a Doppler stethoscope; simultaneous postexercise brachial systolic BPs were determined by auscultation. Brachial systolic BP during armcrank ergometry was estimated by the formula: (resting brachial systolic BP) + (exercise ankle systolic BP - resting ankle systolic BP). Brachial systolic BPs, obtained immediately after arm-crank ergometry, were significantly lower than those estimated during exercise (p less than 0.001), with corresponding mean values of 141 versus 153, 144 versus 173 and 151 versus 182 mm Hg at 150, 300, and 450 kg.m.min-1, respectively. The difference between measured (postexercise) and estimated pressures increased with progressive workloads. These findings indicate that systolic BPs taken by the standard cuff method immediately after arm-crank ergometry are likely to underestimate \"true\" physiologic responses.\r"

  ".W": "Contrast techniques have been used to improve detection of peak velocities by Doppler spectral analysis. To define the effect of contrast enhancement on the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet area and length, 29 patients were studied (25 transthoracic, 4 transesophageal) with 2-dimensional color flow imaging. Three- to 5-ml of agitated saline was injected and images were obtained from 4-chamber views at 12- or 16-cm depth setting. Color gain was optimized to display TR jet at baseline and then reduced to minimal settings before injection. Measurements of TR jet area and length were made in 3 to 5 consecutive cycles. A ratio of TR jet area to 2-dimensional area was derived. TR jet area at baseline was 4.7 +/- 3.6 cm2 and increased significantly (p less than 0.0001) in 26 patients to 8.1 +/- 6.3 cm2 after contrast enhancement. Jet length at baseline was 3.4 +/- 1.7 cm and increased significantly (p less than 0.0001) in 20 patients to 4.1 +/- 1.8 cm after contrast enhancement. The ratio of TR jet area to right atrial area also increased significantly (p less than 0.0001) to greater than 0.20 in 18 of 28 patients after enhancement. Increases in jet area and length were not associated with changes in TR jet or diastolic inflow velocities measured by continuous wave Doppler at baseline and after contrast. Thus, contrast enhancement increases the amplitude of Doppler signals responsible for transvalvular and regurgitant flow. By reducing the effect of attenuation and improving signal-to-noise ratio, it improves delineation of the TR jet using color flow imaging.\r"

  ".W": "Left and right ventricular performance characteristics in operative candidates with combined aortic and mitral regurgitation (AR/MR) have not been well defined. Therefore, we determined radionuclide cineangiographic ejection fractions, as well as echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters, in 8 symptomatic patients undergoing double-valve replacement with pure, severe AR/MR. In order to gain insight into the basis for the poor postoperative survival in patients with this intrinsically biventricular disease, we compared these results with those of 29 symptomatic patients with isolated AR and with 18 symptomatic patients with isolated MR, all also undergoing valve replacement. Before operation, patients with AR/MR had significantly lower left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction than patients with MR (rest, 40 +/- 9% vs 52 +/- 10%, p less than 0.025; exercise, 35 +/- 12% vs 54 +/- 12%, p less than 0.005) and tended to have lower LV ejection fraction than patients with AR alone (rest, 40 +/- 9% vs 45 +/- 12%, difference not significant; exercise, 35 +/- 12% vs 39 +/- 11%, difference not significant); right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction was lower in AR/MR than in AR (p less than 0.01), and tended to be lower than in MR (difference not significant). At average postoperative follow-up of 72 to 76 months (survivors in each group), symptomatic patients with AR/MR had significantly poorer survival than symptomatic patients with isolated MR (p less than 0.05) and were more likely to have persistent symptoms than patients with AR (p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that symptomatic patients with AR/MR have poorer LV and RV performance than similarly symptomatic operative candidates with AR or MR alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Preoperative demonstration of coronary arterial anatomy may be important for babies undergoing the arterial switch operation. Echocardiography is clearly useful, but may not unequivocally show all coronary branches. Standard angiographic views can be confusing. An improved angiographic projection in which the frontal x-ray tube is caudally angled, resulting in a \"laid-back\" position of the image intensifier and cine camera, provides superior visualization of the coronary arteries and their relation to the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The balloon occlusion technique is used for opacification of the aortic root from the transvenous approach. Injection of 1 ml/kg of contrast delivered in 1/2 to 1 second provides the best images. The caudal aortogram is easier to interpret than standard views and facilitates description and recognition of various coronary patterns. The relation between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, the origins of the coronary arteries from the facing sinuses and their proximity to the intercoronary commissures, and the myocardial distribution of each coronary vessel are shown clearly. The caudal view therefore offers significant advantages over conventional projections for demonstration of coronary arterial anatomy in infants with transposition of the great arteries or double-outlet right ventricle.\r"

Doppler echocardiography was performed during Valsalva maneuver in 13 normal subjects. Superior vena cava flow velocities and flow velocity integrals were measured in all 13 subjects. In the 5 subjects in whom the superior vena cava was clearly visualized throughout the maneuver, vena cava diameter was also analyzed. The superior vena cava flow velocity integral at rest was 17 +/- 2 cm. It diminished significantly, disappeared or reversed (-13 +/- 6 cm, p less than 0.001) with phase I of the maneuver. During the maintenance phase (phase II), the flow velocity integral increased significantly (31 +/- 2 cm, p = 0.05 vs baseline and phase I) and was associated with a decrease in superior vena cava lumen diameter at the time of Valsalva and continuing throughout the strain. With release of the maneuver (phase III), there was a sudden significant increase in flow velocity integral (61 +/- 2 cm, p = 0.005 vs phase II) and superior vena cava lumen diameter. Subsequently, superior vena cava flow velocity integral returned to baseline values. This study suggests that one of the ways in which the Valsalva maneuver leads to decreased venous return may be by direct external compression of the superior vena cava.\r"

The death of U.S. Senator Bronson Cutting in a 1935 crash was an important stimulus to improved governmental regulation of civil aviation. The air traffic control system, primitive until and throughout World War II, was soon proven to be inadequate for postwar demands. The midair collision of two large airliners over the Grand Canyon in June 1956 that killed the 128 persons on board was itself a strong stimulus for serious efforts, particularly in improving air traffic control systems. This and many other difficult problems in aviation safety have been addressed in the subsequent 33 years, some with success, although it has not always been immediate, and with major accidents still occurring. Commercial air travel is safe and widely accepted, however, and there is promise for additional important advances here.\r"

Death was caused by coronary arteriosclerosis, was characterized by acute coronary changes, and occurred in a group younger than the usual age for sudden cardiac death. Visitors with two-vessel disease had an incidence of sudden death nearly four times that of Kauaians (p less than 0.02), with a ninefold increase of coronary thrombosis (p less than 0.001), a sixfold prevalence of old myocardial infarcts (p less than 0.001), and three times the prevalence of cardiomegaly (p less than 0.001). The circadian pattern of these deaths was different from that previously described in acute myocardial infarction or sudden death, with the number of incidents rising steadily through the day in contrast to the morning peak described in previously published series. The syndrome was expressed in decedents with two-vessel coronary disease either with acute coronary artery lesions--thrombosis, hemorrhage in a plaque, or ruptured coronary artery--or no lesions, presumably spasm. Underlying chronic processes included enlarged heart or old myocardial infarct, which both occurred with a significantly greater incidence in travelers than in local residents, and in a totally different pattern from that occurring in subjects with three-vessel disease. It is postulated that the syndrome is caused by stress related to travel and time zone changes.\r"

Data on 398 casino-related deaths occurring in 1982-1986 were collected and analyzed: 83% of the total number of fatalities were sudden cardiac deaths. Most of the victims were elderly white retired men who had previously diagnosed medical conditions. Many of the victims' underlying medical problems are of a type known to be associated with compulsive gambling. The majority of deaths occurred during the afternoon hours on weekends in October, January, and May. Of the victims, 86% were from New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. For Atlantic City, a gambling community known to have a relatively high rate of crime and drug-trafficking, only 1% of all deaths were homicides. We speculate that the stress of gambling activities may induce sudden cardiac death. We therefore recommend that communities planning to legalize casino gambling mandate that gambling establishments provide emergency health care services for their patrons.\r"

Patients' records were rated for the frequency, duration, and complexity of distinct affective states. Very rapid mood fluctuations were absent among bipolar patients in 1960 but were evident in 1975 and 1985. In each year, bipolar patients displayed more frequent, complex, and mixed episodes than did unipolar patients. The results suggest that more frequent episodes occur among bipolar than unipolar patients and that very rapid switch processes have become more widespread for some bipolar patients.\r"

PTSD was explained primarily by war stressors, including threat to life and exposure to grotesque death, but premilitary and postmilitary factors also contributed to the likelihood of a current diagnosis of PTSD. Panic disorder was also highly predicted by war experiences, whereas prewar functioning played a stronger role in several non-PTSD diagnoses. The study supported the notion that PTSD is specifically linked to intense stressors. Mechanisms for interactions among risk factors are discussed.\r"
