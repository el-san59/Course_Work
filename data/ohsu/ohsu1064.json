Normal scans were obtained in 127 (60%) cases. Of the remaining 86 cases, 82 (38%) were reported to show fractures of the proximal femur, three showed pubic ramus fractures, and one acetabular fracture was demonstrated. Review and follow-up has revealed eight false positive and two false negative scans. The various factors accounting for these errors are considered, and the clinical implications discussed. Careful analysis of accompanying plain radiographs is stressed when interpreting scintigrams.\r"

  ".W": "A method for quantifying tissue perfusion by dynamic computed tomography (CT) is described. By applying a nuclear medicine data processing technique to time-density data from a single-location dynamic CT sequence, tissue perfusion can be determined from the maximum gradient of the tissue time-density curve divided by the peak enhancement of the aorta. Using this method, splenic perfusion was measured at 1.2 ml min-1 ml-1, normal renal cortical perfusion at 2.5 ml min-1 ml-1 and normal renal medullary perfusion at 1.1 ml min-1 ml-1. Changes in cortical and medullary perfusion in renal failure and hypertension were demonstrated. The ability of dynamic CT to provide quantitative functional information is not well recognized and is potentially of value when studying structures, such as the renal cortex and medulla, that cannot be anatomically resolved by standard functional imaging techniques.\r"

Contrast media of strength 300 mgI/ml were also evaluated at 50% dilution (150 mgI/ml) with N-saline. Iodine delivery differed significantly (p less than 0.005) between samples at room temperature: Omnipaque 350 (1163 mg/s) less than Niopam 370 (1311 mg/s) less than Omnipaque 300 (1422 mg/s) less than Niopam 300 (1635 mg/s) and Ultravist 300 (1636 mg/s). Niopam 300 and Ultravist 300 delivered 41% more iodine per second than Omnipaque 350 at room temperature. Similar differences were identified at body temperature, while delivery of individual media was on average 23.5% greater than at room temperature. No significant difference between iodine delivery rates of diluted media at room temperature or body temperature was identified. The results demonstrate that iodine delivery and hence vascular opacification are better achieved during hand-injection arteriography by using relatively low viscosity media such as Niopam 300 or Ultravist 300. In digital subtraction arteriography all 300 strength contrast media diluted to 150 strength are equally effective.\r"

  ".W": "Selective uptake of radiolabelled meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) in neuroblastoma provides a possible approach to biologically targeted radiotherapy of this disease. A mathematical model was used to predict absorbed doses to tumours of varying size from therapeutic 131I-mIBG, based on measurements of 125I-mIBG uptake in surgically excised tumours from six patients. Two size categories of tumour target were considered: bulk tumour and microscopic disease. The predicted absorbed doses were compared with doses calculated to achieve a 50% probability of tumour cure. The analysis shows that the probability of tumour cure depends strongly on mIBG uptake, effective half-life of mIBG in tumour and tumour diameter. Small microtumours may be relatively resistant to mIBG treatment owing to the limited absorption of 131I beta-energy. The product of patient mass and percentage uptake per unit mass of tumour may be a useful indicator of therapeutic outcome when targeted radiotherapy is used for the treatment of paediatric tumours.\r"

Water-soluble contrast media led to a significant fall in the renal perfusate flow and an increase in the renal vascular resistance (RVR). The magnitude of these haemodynamic changes was independent of the osmolality of the tested agents. This study shows a direct effect of WSCM on the vascular resistance of the isolated perfused rat kidney.\r"

For each QDR-1000 site visited a set of spine phantom scans was also acquired on a QDR-1000 at Guy's Hospital to serve as a control study. All scans were analysed using the Hologic scan comparison software. Radiographers at each site were asked to perform their own independent analysis of the scans of the two volunteers. The precision of the bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC) and projected area (Area) results for a set of 10 phantom scans was 0.11%, 0.14% and 0.12% respectively. The coefficient of variation (CV) between sites for the sets of phantom scans was 0.58% for BMD, 0.71% for BMC and 0.35% for Area. In comparison, CVs for the phantom scans acquired on a single QDR-1000 were 0.23%, 0.23% and 0.09% respectively. The CV for the BMD results on the two volunteers obtained using the scan comparison software averaged 1.4% for the spine and 2.1% for the femoral neck. The CV for the results obtained by site radiographers averaged 2.2% for the spine and 3.7% for the femoral neck. Significant differences in the technique used for hip analysis were found. Conclusions: (i) differences in calibration between systems were generally less than 1%; (ii) variations in results resulting from differences in analytical technique were more significant than those resulting from differences in calibration.\r"

These examinations were (1) plain film radiography of the internal auditory meatus (IAM), (2) computed tomography (CT) of the IAM, (3) CT of the posterior fossa and (4) CT of the IAM with air contrast. Organ dose measurements were performed using lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosemeters loaded in a patient equivalent phantom. Dose equivalents to various organs are presented, together with the effective dose equivalent and collective effective dose equivalent for each examination. Hypothetical fatal somatic risks for each examination studied here have been estimated from the effective dose equivalents. The estimated number of hypothetical fatal cancers induced by radiological examinations for AN is between approximately 110 and 820 times lower than the number of detected AN, depending on the method of assessing the radiation dose to the remainder organs. It is concluded that in this particular study the radiological examinations are of net benefit to this group of patients.\r"

In some instances, commonly used rules of thumb for the selection of an appropriate energy may be valid. A more accurate approximate energy, however, may be determined by an analysis which takes into account both the spectral qualities of the beam and the material through which it passes. The theoretical basis of this method of analysis is presented in this paper. Experimental agreement with theory for a range of materials and beam qualities is also presented and demonstrates the validity of the theoretical approach taken.\r"

All staff had been monitored with film dosimeters for exposure to radiation. The study cohort consisted of 4151 persons, accruing 49553 person-years at risk. The collective radiation dose was 76.54 manSv and the mean dose 18.4 mSv. A total of 163 cancer cases were observed with 152.3 expected. The risks for cancers usually considered to be radiogenic were not elevated. A significant excess of prostatic cancer was observed (five cases, relative risk, 6.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.94-14.06); this is likely to be a chance finding. No relation was observed between radiation dose or years of exposure and cancer risk, but a weak non-significant increase in risk with time since first exposure was seen.\r"

Data were collected at various times including the preinduction period, every minute during the infusion period (minute 0 to 14), and 15, 20 and 25 min after the start of the infusion (1, 6 and 11 min respectively after completion of the infusion). Within three minutes of the sufentanil infusion, the total power and the relative power of delta increased to near maximum, while the 95% spectral edge and the mean frequency decreased markedly. In spite of the continued infusion of sufentanil, there were very little further changes in the EEG activity. This ceiling effect for the EEG changes appear to coincide with the failure to respond to verbal command. We conclude that the power spectrum of the EEG failed to respond to increasing doses of sufentanil during its infusion after the rapid initial changes.\r"

Hyperbaric tetracaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 was administered in a dose range of 0.27-1.10 mg.kg-1. Attempted lumbar puncture failed in three infants. In 24 procedures, spinal anaesthesia alone provided satisfactory operating conditions; in 20, supplementary inhalational general anaesthesia or iv ketamine was necessary. Perioperative apnoeic episodes requiring bag/mask assisted ventilation occurred in six infants. In five infants, apnoeic spells occurred in the postoperative period. No infant required tracheal intubation; there was no haemodynamic instability. Twenty-four infants required no postoperative analgesia. Our experience suggests that spinal anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair in very low birth weight infants reduces but does not eliminate the risk of respiratory instability, and that supplementary anaesthesia is often necessary to provide satisfactory operating conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Premature infants are prone to develop postoperative apnoea. The purpose of the present study was to determine if risk factors could be identified to predict which patients would require postoperative tracheal intubation and lung ventilation. Twenty-five extremely premature infants (birth weight: 811 +/- 242 g (mean +/- SD) and operation weight: 1585 +/- 394 g) needing cryotherapy for retinopathy were studied. After surgery the tracheas were extubated if there was no prolonged apnoea, SaO2 greater than 85%, and heart rate greater than 120 bpm. In eight, tracheal extubation in the operating room was unsuccessful. Using multivariate discriminant analysis, four risk factors correlated with the need for pulmonary ventilation-gestational duration, birth weight, postconceptional age, and preoperative aminophylline treatment for seven days. A scoring system using these factors successfully predicted the need for a tracheal tube after surgery in 92% of patients. It is concluded that the system may be clinically useful in the perioperative care of low-birth-weight infants as it identifies important variables for evaluating postoperative prolonged apnoea.\r"

  ".W": "Children with atrial septal defects (ASD) have less respiratory compliance (Crs) than normal cohorts. There could be implications for anaesthetic management if these children also have decreased compliance during anaesthesia. To examine the changes in Crs before, during and following surgical correction of the atrial defect, Crs was measured in 29 infants and children, 15 undergoing correction of secundum type atrial septal defects, and a group of 14 children of similar weight undergoing non-thoracic surgery. During sedation, Crs was measured using the single breath technique (SBT) and during anaesthesia, both before and after the surgical procedure, an inflation technique was applied to determine Crs. To investigate the aetiology of the difference in Crs, the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp:Qs) was determined using echocardiography during sedation in the ASD patients. During sedation, Crs in the ASD group was 52.7 +/- 19.5% less than in the control group. The slope of the line of regression of Crs vs height for the ASD group was significantly less (P less than 0.05) than that of the control group during sedation. However, during anaesthesia, Crs in the ASD group was not significantly different from the control group either before or after surgery. The per cent decrease in Crs during sedation in the children with ASD, in comparison with the control group, did not correlate with the Qp:Qs ratio of the ASD group (r2 = 0.012,NS). We conclude that, in spite of lower Crs during sedation, infants and children with ASD do not have lower Crs during anaesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass than normal controls undergoing non-thoracic surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Past studies have shown that postoperative nausea and vomiting is more frequent in women than men, appears to elevate around the time of menarche and is reduced around the time of menopause. This retrospective review of a one-year experience of laparoscopic tubal ligation at our institute examined the effect of menstrual cycle on postoperative nausea and vomiting. The anaesthetic and surgical techniques were consistent for all patients. Patient data included age, weight, last day of menstrual cycle, the length of anaesthetic, the dose of inhalational agent, the dose of narcotic, emesis on emergence and whether or not droperidol was used. Of the the 235 patients in the study, the incidence of nausea and vomiting was 28%. One hundred fifty-eight had had no preoperative antiemetic and 77 had received droperidol. These two groups were analyzed separately. The incidence in the group not receiving droperidol was 33.5% and in the droperidol group, 16.9% (P less than 0.01). The incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher on the first eight menstrual days (51.6 vs 21.6, P less than 0.001), was highest on day five of the menstrual cycle and lowest on days 18, 19, and 20 where there was no nausea and vomiting. Droperidol reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting but the variation in postoperative nausea and vomiting during the cycle persisted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Epidural anaesthesia was established in Group I with 6 ml 0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 50 micrograms and in both Groups II and III with 6 ml 0.25% bupivacaine. In the women whose pain score (Visual Analogue Scale) decreased by at least 50% within 15 min, CIEA was given until delivery. The initial infusion rate in all three groups was set at 7 ml.hr-1, but was decreased in the event of motor block or excessive sensory level. For inadequate analgesia, bupivacaine 0.25% in 3 ml supplements was given every 30 min, as required. During the first stage of labour, 88% of women in Group I reported excellent or good analgesia compared with 92% of women in Group II (NS) and with 59% in Group III (P less than 0.05). The proportion of women reporting excellent/good analgesia during the second stage was approximately 65% in all three groups.

In all patients, the onset of neuromuscular recovery occurred first in the OOM. The time required to recover to a T4/T1 = 0.70 +/- 0.01 (SD) was earlier in the OOM compared with the ADM muscles in both the atracurium (33.4 +/- 5 vs 46.5 +/- 8, P less than 0.005) and vecuronium (46.5 +/- 12 vs 60.3 +/- 20, P less than 0.005) groups. When the OOM attained a T4/T1 = 0.70 +/- 0.01, the simultaneous T4/T1 in the ADM was 0.29 +/- 0.15 (P less than 0.05) in the atracurium group and 0.41 +/- 0.16 (P less than 0.01) in the vecuronium group. We conclude that (1) the facial muscles (OOM) recover earlier than the hypothenar muscles (ADM) and (2) an EMG T4/T1 = 0.70 in the facial muscles may not indicate adequate recovery of neuromuscular function.\r"

Group I received pancuronium (P) 0.08 mg.kg-1, Group II received vecuronium (V) 0.1 mg.kg-1, Group III received atracurium (A) 0.5 mg.kg-1 and Group IV metocurine 0.1 mg.kg-1 plus pancuronium 0.02 mg.kg-1 (M-P). Sufentanil, 20 micrograms.kg-1 was administered before sternotomy, 10 micrograms.kg-1 being injected before tracheal intubation and 10 micrograms.kg-1 afterwards. Heart rate (HR), ECG leadII and V5, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial and pulmonary blood pressures, central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (W) were measured and recorded at the time of seven strategic events between the pre-induction of anaesthesia period and sternotomy. Cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistances (SVR) were also measured before induction of anaesthesia and after the administration of S 10 micrograms.kg-1 plus the MR. The HR decreased from baseline values in the post-tracheal intubation period in all groups except in P group. The mean arterial pressure also decreased significantly in all groups except in the P group. The CO did not change from baseline values but SVR decreased in all groups. There was no evidence of new myocardial ischaemia according to the ECG monitoring and there was no significant difference in the HR changes between patients who had or who had not received beta-blockers in any group. We conclude that within the present study conditions and design, HR and blood pressure changed least with pancuronium.\r"

The study sample was 250 ASA physical status I-II patients, scheduled for various elective surgical procedures. The first 100 were randomly allocated to receive 1.5 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl via a peripheral venous cannula (Group 1), or an equivalent volume of saline (Group 2). Twenty-eight per cent of patients who received fentanyl, but none given saline, coughed within one minute (P less than 0.0001). The second 150 patients were then randomly assigned to three equal pretreatment groups. Group 3 received 0.01 mg.kg-1 atropine iv one minute before fentanyl. Groups 4 and 5 received 0.2 mg.kg-1 morphine im, and 7.5 mg midazolam po, respectively, one hour before fentanyl. Thirty per cent of patients in Group 3, 6% in Group 4, and 40% in Group 5, had a cough response to fentanyl. Fentanyl, when given through a peripheral cannula, provoked cough in a considerable proportion of patients. This was not altered by premedication with atropine or midazolam, but was reduced after morphine (P less than 0.01). Coughing upon induction of anaesthesia is undesirable in some patients, and stimulation of cough by fentanyl in unpremedicated patients may be of clinical importance.\r"

Although previous reports have documented venous air embolism occurring in a number of ways, including during initial catheterization, when catheters crack or are disconnected, and after catheter removal, no reports mention the possibility of air embolism occurring when a guide wire without a catheter was in place. A patient is presented who displayed signs and symptoms of venous air embolism (tachypnoea, chest pain, and arterial hypoxaemia) during central venous catheter manipulation while a guide wire alone was in place. Pulse oximetry was used to detect hypoxaemia and suggest an aetiology for the patient's clinical symptoms. It is postulated that a previously described gasp reflex or some sort of sustained negative pressure manoeuvre caused venous air embolism around the guide wire and accounted for the patient's signs and symptoms. During central venous catheter placement, a high index of suspicion for venous air embolism should be maintained, pulse oximetry should be used, the skin entrance site should be kept covered by an occlusive dressing, and the patient should be positioned head-down.\r"

In this patient continuous spinal anaesthesia was slowly titrated to the desired level, coincident haemodynamic alterations were easily treated as they developed, and high serum local anaesthetic concentrations which occur with other regional anaesthetic techniques were avoided.\r"

No large-scale data are available to identify the importance of recognized risk factors for stroke in the perioperative period. A review of the literature shows that the incidence and mechanism of its occurrence are influenced by the presence of cardiovascular disease and the type of surgery. The most common cause of perioperative stroke is embolism. In non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of perioperative stroke is higher among the elderly. Properly administered, controlled hypotension is associated with minimal risk of stroke. Cerebral vasospasm may be the cause of focal cerebral ischaemia in eclamptic patients, and the aggressive treatment of hypertension may exacerbate the neurological damage. The risk of stroke associated with carotid endarterectomy is closely related to the preoperative neurological presentation, and the experience of the surgical/anaesthetic team. Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease, acute stroke, asymptomatic carotid lesions, preoperative assessment of risk, local and general anaesthesia, cerebral protection and monitoring during carotid endarterectomy are discussed with reference to reducing the risk of perioperative stroke. Adequate monitoring and protection have minimized the risk of ischaemia from carotid clamping, and the major mechanism of stroke is embolization.\r"

APACHE II, introduced in 1985, was a simplified modification of the original APACHE. The APACHE II score consisted of three parts: 12 acute physiological variables, age and chronic health status. Probability of death can be derived by using the disease category and the APACHE II score. The uses of APACHE II include risk stratification to account for case mix in clinical studies, comparison of the quality of care among ICUs, and assessment of group and individual prognoses. APACHE III, a refinement of APACHE II, will be introduced in late 1990. The APACHE III data base includes 17,457 patients from a representative sample of 40 American hospitals. Additional potential uses of APACHE III include the identification of factors in the ICU which contribute to outcome and assistance in individual patient decision-making. This article reviews the development, current uses and potential applications of the APACHE system.\r"

  ".W": "The literature dealing with the magnitude, mechanism and effects of reduced FRC in the perioperative period is reviewed. During general anaesthesia FRC is reduced by approximately 20%. The reduction is greater in the obese and in patients with COPD. The most likely mechanism is the loss of inspiratory muscle tone of the muscles acting on the rib cage. Gas trapping is an additional mechanism. Lung compliance decreases and airways resistance increases, in large part, due to decreased FRC. The larynx is displaced anteriorly and elongated, making laryngoscopy and intubation more difficult. The change in FRC creates or increases intrapulmonary shunt and areas of low ventilation to perfusion. This is due to the occurrence of compression atelectasis, and to regional changes in mechanics and airway closure which tend to reduce ventilation to dependent lung zones which are still well perfused. Abdominal and thoracic operations tend to increase shunting further. Large tidal volume but not PEEP will improve oxygenation, although both increase FRC. Both FRC and vital capacity are reduced following abdominal and thoracic surgery in a predictable pattern. The mechanism is the combined effect of incisional pain and reflex dysfunction of the diaphragm. Additional effects of thoracic surgery include pleural effusion, cooling of the phrenic nerve and mediastinal widening. Postoperative hypoxaemia is a function of reduced FRC and airway closure. There is no real difference among the various methods of active lung expansion in terms of the speed of restoration of lung function, or in preventing postoperative atelectasis/pneumonia. Epidural analgesia does not influence the rate of recovery of lung function, nor does it prevent atelectasis/pneumonia.\r"

The slope of the block/fade relationship differed between onset of and recovery from neuromuscular block following single doses of d-tubocurarine, vecuronium or pancuronium. Decreasing the dose of d-tubocurarine or using a divided dose technique to accelerate onset (i.e., priming) increased the amount of fade for a given amount of block. In addition, the block/fade relationships for cumulative dosing and sequential dilution were the same when measurements were made at steady-state for several doses. It is concluded that the block/fade relationship in the mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation is variable, and is related to the time course of the neuromuscular block. In addition, the block/fade relationships for d-tubocurarine, vecuronium and pancuronium did not differ when determined at steady-state.\r"

Group 2 (n = 6) received saline at 0 min, flumazenil 0.0025 mg.kg-1 iv at 45 min and flumazenil 0.16 mg.kg-1 at 90 min. Group 3 (n = 6) received midazolam 1.6 mg.kg-1 at 0 min followed by continuous iv infusion (1.25 mg.kg-1.hr-1). Flumazenil was given at 45 and 90 min as in Group 2. In Group 4 (n = 6) aqueous humour pressure was elevated to about 35 mmHg then midazolam and flumazenil were given as in Group 3. Aqueous humour pressure was determined using a 30-gauge needle placed into the anterior chamber. Saline or flumazenil produced no change in aqueous humour pressure in Groups 1 and 2. In Groups 3 and 4, midazolam decreased aqueous humour pressure from 18 +/- 2 mmHg (mean +/- SD) to 14 +/- 3 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and from 34 +/- 5 mmHg to 31 +/- 3 mmHg (P less than 0.01) respectively. Flumazenil given during continuous infusion of midazolam produced increases of aqueous humour pressure of 2 +/- 1 (P less than 0.01) to 5 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.01) that lasted less than or equal to 12 min. It is concluded that at both normal and elevated aqueous humour pressures flumazenil produces statistically significant but clinically unimportant increases of aqueous humour pressure in anaesthetized dogs receiving midazolam, but not in dogs given no benzodiazepine.\r"

At least three different matching criteria have been described in the literature: optimization of heart rate, of power output, and of external efficiency. Although these suggestions are based on experimental findings, there is little understanding of the underlying principles. We now suggest that the balance between the ventricle and its load is a result of the evolutionary process. To support our view, three simple assumptions are proposed regarding the evolutionary determinants underlying the relation between ventricle and arterial load: 1) Arterial pressure and flow to be generated by the ventricular pump under normal (control) conditions are set by the demands of the body. 2) Mechanical properties of contractile machinery and arterial wall material are given. 3) The heart and arterial system should have minimum size. On the basis thereof, we argue that heart rate is related to maintenance of diastolic pressure and show that the ventricle operates close to optimum power and efficiency to attain minimum size.\r"

  ".W": "A mathematical model of the membrane action potential of the mammalian ventricular cell is introduced. The model is based, whenever possible, on recent single-cell and single-channel data and incorporates the possibility of changing extracellular potassium concentration [K]o. The fast sodium current, INa, is characterized by fast upstroke velocity (Vmax = 400 V/sec) and slow recovery from inactivation. The time-independent potassium current, IK1, includes a negative-slope phase and displays significant crossover phenomenon as [K]o is varied. The time-dependent potassium current, IK, shows only a minimal degree of crossover. A novel potassium current that activates at plateau potentials is included in the model. The simulated action potential duplicates the experimentally observed effects of changes in [K]o on action potential duration and rest potential. Physiological simulations focus on the interaction between depolarization and repolarization (i.e., premature stimulation). Results demonstrate the importance of the slow recovery of INa in determining the response of the cell. Simulated responses to periodic stimulation include monotonic Wenckebach patterns and alternans at normal [K]o, whereas at low [K]o nonmonotonic Wenckebach periodicities, aperiodic patterns, and enhanced supernormal excitability that results in unstable responses (\"chaotic activity\") are observed. The results are consistent with recent experimental observations, and the model simulations relate these phenomena to the underlying ionic channel kinetics.\r"

In bioassay experiments (in the presence of 10(-5) M indomethacin), infusion of PDBu (10(-9)-10(-7) M) through a femoral artery (donor) segment with endothelium evoked further, concentration-dependent contraction of superfused canine coronary artery bioassay rings without endothelium (already contracted with 10(-7) M PDBu). Removal of the endothelium from the donor segment abolished further contractions of the bioassay ring to 10(-9) M PDBu and significantly depressed the contractile responses to 10(-9) and 10(-7) M PDBu infused through the donor segment. The inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate had no effect on vascular preparations mounted in the bioassay system. Selective exposure of the bioassay tissue to 10(-7) M PDBu completely inhibited its responsiveness to basally released endothelium-derived relaxing factor.

  ".W": "Based on the premise that short-time-scale, small-amplitude pressure/volume/outflow behavior of the left ventricular chamber was dominated by dynamic processes originating in cardiac myofilaments, a prototype model was built to predict pressure responses to volume perturbations. In the model, chamber pressure was taken to be the product of the number of generators in a pressure-bearing state and their average volumetric distortion, as in the muscle theory of A.F. Huxley, in which force was equal to the number of attached crossbridges and their average lineal distortion. Further, as in the muscle theory, pressure generators were assumed to cycle between two states, the pressure-bearing state and the non-pressure-bearing state. Experiments were performed in the isolated ferret heart, where variable volume decrements (0.01-0.12 ml) were removed at two commanded flow rates (flow clamps, -7 and -14 ml/sec). Pressure responses to volume removals were analyzed. Although the prototype model accounted for most features of the pressure responses, subtle but systematic discrepancies were observed. The presence or absence of flow and the magnitude of flow affected estimates of model parameters. However, estimates of parameters did not differ when the model was fitted to flow clamps with similar magnitudes of flows but different volume changes. Thus, prototype model inadequacies were attributed to misrepresentations of flow-related effects but not of volume-related effects. Based on these discrepancies, an improved model was built that added to the simple two-state cycling scheme, a pathway to a third state. This path was followed only in response to volume change. The improved model eliminated the deficiencies of the prototype model and was adequate in accounting for all observations. Since the template for the improved model was taken from the cycling crossbridge theory of muscle contraction, it was concluded that, in spite of the complexities of geometry, architecture, and regional heterogeneity of function and structure, crossbridge mechanisms dominated the short-time-scale dynamics of left ventricular chamber behavior.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the aortic elastic behavior in response to vitamin D3-induced accelerated calcinosis in conscious dogs chronically instrumented with a pressure microtransducer and a pair of ultrasonic diameter dimension gauges in the upper descending thoracic aorta. The two functional phases of the elastic segmental properties of the aorta in vivo were discriminated by computation on a beat-by-beat basis from the phasic pressure-diameter (P-D) hysteresis loops in basal conditions and during the transient state of a wide range of pressures obtained mechanically (aortic occlusion) or pharmacologically (angiotensin bolus). The overall P-D curve formed by all P-D hysteresis loops was comprised of two linear relations according to a model that assumes that only elastin is stretched at lower pressures, whereas both elastin and collagen are stretched at higher pressures. The slope of the first linear portion of the P-D curve was considered as the elastin P-D elastic modulus, and the slope of the curve obtained by subtraction between the P-D curve and the extrapolation of the elastin straight line was assumed to be the collagen P-D elastic modulus. After vitamin D3-induced calcinosis, the elastin elastic modulus was unaffected, whereas the collagen elastic modulus decreased significantly during occlusion maneuvers (58.6%, p less than 0.01) and during bolus injections of angiotensin (37.2%, p less than 0.05). The collagen elastic modulus correlated with the serum calcium concentration (r = -0.65, p less than 0.001) and with the aortic pulse pressure (r = 0.51, p less than 0.01), and this relation persisted at constant heart rate. Histopathologic analysis evidenced calcium-depositing elastic lamina, focal disappearance of collagen, and rupture of elastic fibers. The present study shows that accelerated, severe, experimental calcinosis-inducing calcium deposition inside the large artery walls is accompanied by a clear-cut paradoxical reduction in arterial rigidity that is mainly due to functional and structural modification of collagen elasticity.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of aging on the human myocardium, 67 hearts were obtained from individuals who died from causes other than cardiovascular disease. The age interval examined was 17-90 years. Regression analysis demonstrated that the aging process was characterized by a loss of 38 million and 14 million myocyte nuclei/yr in the left and right ventricular myocardium, respectively. This loss in muscle mass was accompanied by a progressive increase in myocyte cell volume per nucleus in both ventricles. Left ventricular myocytes enlarged by 110 microns3/yr, whereas right ventricular myocytes increased by 118 microns3/yr, resulting in a preservation of ventricular wall thickness. However, the cellular hypertrophic response was unable to maintain normal cardiac mass. Left and right ventricular weights decreased by 0.70 and 0.21 g/yr, respectively. In conclusion, loss of cells and enlargement of the remaining myocytes may represent the structural basis for the reduced compensatory capacity of the aged heart and together may contribute to the development of myocardial dysfunction and failure in the elderly.\r"

However, not all endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is caused by endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and few studies have correlated changes in vascular tone with measurement of free cytosolic calcium concentration or nitric oxide. The effects of three endothelium-dependent vasodilators (acetylcholine, bradykinin, and A23187) on vascular tone and nitric oxide production were studied in proximal rat pulmonary artery rings. Changes in free cytosolic calcium concentration and nitric oxide production were also studied in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. A23187 and bradykinin caused pulmonary vasodilatation, nitric oxide production, and elevation of endothelial calcium concentrations. Although acetylcholine caused endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, it reduced free cytosolic calcium concentration and failed to increase nitric oxide levels. Acetylcholine-induced dilatation was partially inhibited by meclofenamate but was unaffected by ouabain. Acetylcholine, unlike bradykinin and A23187, does not act through a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism in the rat pulmonary vasculature.\r"

  ".W": "One of the fundamental properties of cardiac muscle is the increase in force generated and work performed with a rise in the resting length of the tissue. There are data to indicate that length-dependent responses of electromechanical coupling and calcium binding by troponin are part of the basis for the pressure-volume relation in the heart. In this study, the contribution of changes in the functional properties of the contractile proteins independent of modification in electromechanical coupling has been examined. Isolated working hearts containing either a mixture of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isozymes (alpha[fast] and beta [slow]) or exclusively the fast MHC have been subjected to left atrial filling pressures (LAPs) between 5 and 20 cm H2O. After 40 minutes at a given LAP, the heart was quickly frozen. The relative activities of calcium- and actin-activated ATPase of V1 and V3 myosin, containing alpha- and beta-MHC, were measured in cryostatic sections of the heart by quantitative histochemistry under conditions for which the concentration of calcium would not be limiting. In hearts containing both isozymes of myosin, the relative enzymatic activity of each isozyme of myosin varied with LAP. At low LAP, V1 was primarily responsible for the enzymatic activity, but as LAP increased the relative contribution of V1 decreased and that of V3 increased. The change in the calcium- and actin-activated activities of the enzyme with change in LAP occurred within 5 minutes and was reversible. In spite of the apparent substitution of enzymatic activity of V3 for V1, total myosin ATPase activity did not decline, but instead remained constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

[125I]Cyanopindolol was used as a ligand for beta-adrenergic receptors. Binding of the radioligand to sections of the three coronary arteries under study was saturable, stereoselective, reversible, and displaceable by antagonists and agonists with the rank order of potency expected for beta-adrenergic receptors. Analysis of binding isotherms indicated maximum binding capacities of 41.5 fmol/mg protein for the right coronary artery, 35.4 fmol/mg protein for the left coronary artery, and 25.7 fmol/mg protein for the anterior interventricular branch. Dissociation constants were approximately 35 pM in the arteries examined. The relative amounts of beta 1- and beta 2-receptor subtypes were as follows: 72% beta 1-receptors and 28% beta 2-receptors in the right coronary artery; 65% beta 1-receptors and 35% beta 2-receptors in the left coronary artery; 40% beta 1-receptors and 60% beta 2-receptors in the anterior interventricular branch. The results of autoradiographic analysis revealed a predominance of beta 1-receptors in the medial layer. beta 2-Receptors were localized primarily in the adventitia, in the adventitia-media border, and in the intimal layer. These results should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the control of coronary circulation in humans.\r"

The tibialis anterior muscles of Syrian golden hamsters were excised and soaked in bupivacaine (0.75%) for 10 minutes to ensure uniform degeneration of muscle fibers. The tendons were resutured, and the graft became revascularized spontaneously. Fluorescent intravital microscopy was used to measure the responsiveness of 10-40-microns arterioles to topically applied adenosine and norepinephrine at 7, 14, and 30 days after grafting. Nine to 25 arterioles were studied at each time period. Both intravital and light microscopy were used at each time period to characterize the structural development of the microcirculation. We found that the responsiveness of regenerated arterioles returned to control values for topically applied norepinephrine by 14 days and for adenosine by 30 days. Light microscopy showed regenerated blood vessels in the center of the grafts early in the second week after grafting. The structure of the microcirculation at 7 days was characterized by a plexiform microvascular pattern, long spiderlike capillaries, and arterioles and venules that had irregular walls and an irregular branching pattern. Rhodamine-labeled albumin extravasated spontaneously. The 14-day grafts had a more linear capillary pattern, and the arterioles and venules often contained loops that had circular flow patterns. By 30 days, a parallel capillary structure had developed, no vascular loops were present, and the arteriolar-venular pattern was nearly normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Isolated hearts were perfused by the method of Langendorff at constant pressure with Krebs-Henseleit buffer saturated with 5% CO2 and either 95% or 20% O2. Toxicity due to doxorubicin was evaluated from changes in heart rate and from uptake of trypan blue by nonviable nuclei. Heart rate was stable in control hearts perfused at 95% O2 for 30 minutes but decreased in hearts perfused at 20% O2. Doxorubicin (30 microM) increased O2 uptake due to redox cycling by approximately 75 mumol/g/hr at 95% O2 but had no effect in hearts perfused at 20% O2. Heart rate decreased during 30 minutes of perfusion with doxorubicin and 95% or 20% O2, with greater decreases occurring with 95% than 20% O2 compared with values for the respective untreated controls. Irreversible cell damage indexed from uptake of vital dye due to doxorubicin was threefold greater than control at 95% O2 but was not different from control at at 20% O2.

For each patient, the AV nodal function curve (i.e., the AH interval plotted as a function of the atrial pacing cycle length) was compared during both the control state and phenylephrine infusion; the AH intervals during each condition at chosen short (AHS) and long (AHL) cycle lengths were compared. The sinus cycle length increased during phenylephrine infusion from 941 +/- 294 to 1,115 +/- 347 msec (p = 0.013). The AH interval during sinus rhythm was not significantly prolonged (77 versus 82 msec, p = NS). The shortest atrial pacing cycle length yielding 1:1 AV nodal conduction increased during phenylephrine infusion from 412 +/- 120 to 575 +/- 211 msec (p less than 0.01). Of note, the degree of sinus cycle length prolongation did not correlate with the degree of prolongation in the shortest atrial pacing cycle length yielding 1:1 AV nodal conduction. The AV nodal function curve was shifted markedly to the right and only slightly upward.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study demonstrates that the hexapeptide angiotensin II-(3-8) and L-arginine, generated through enzymatic degradation of angiotensin, mediate endothelium-dependent dilation in rabbit brain arterioles. Topical application of angiotensin II (10(-5) M) on the brain surface of anesthetized rabbits caused 21.6 +/- 4.5% (mean +/- SEM) cerebral arteriolar dilation. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin did not change this dilation. The natural degradation product of angiotensin II in the brain, angiotensin III, also induced vasodilation at concentrations of 10(-7) to 10(-5) M. The dilation to angiotensin II and angiotensin III was eliminated in the presence of 10(-5) M methylene blue, a known inhibitor of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Amastatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor and blocker of enzymatic angiotensin degradation, also inhibited the response to angiotensin II and angiotensin III. The angiotensin fragment angiotensin II-(3-8), which lacks the amino-terminal L-arginine residue of angiotensin III, did not elicit an arteriolar response. When angiotensin II-(3-8) was topically applied subsequent to L-arginine, a 21.2 +/- 2.9% vasodilation was observed. L-Arginine itself induced only moderate vasodilation with a maximum of 4.0 +/- 0.9% at 10(-5) M L-arginine. The dilating response to angiotensin II-(3-8) after L-arginine was inhibited by methylene blue. It was not affected by amastatin. It is concluded that degradation products of angiotensin, rather than angiotensin II itself, induce endothelium-dependent dilation in rabbit brain arterioles without involvement of cyclooxygenase products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The overflow of endogenous norepinephrine and its neuronal metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DOPEG) was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. DOPEG served as the indicator of free axoplasmic norepinephrine concentrations. The overflow of the norepinephrine cotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) was determined by radioimmunoassay and NPY was used as marker for exocytotic release. Electrical stimulation of the left stellate ganglion resulted in exocytotic norepinephrine release in rat and guinea pig hearts. Ouabain caused an increase in stimulation-induced norepinephrine overflow from rat and guinea pig hearts by 40%. However, overflow of NPY was decreased by 40%, indicating a reduced exocytosis rate. Ouabain increased both norepinephrine and NPY overflow, suggesting enhancement of exocytosis, when neuronal catecholamine uptake (uptake1) was blocked by desipramine or when presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors were inhibited by yohimbine. The results demonstrate an interaction of ouabain with both calcium-dependent exocytosis and uptake1 of norepinephrine. Under calcium-free conditions, ouabain or potassium-free perfusate resulted in norepinephrine release from hearts when the axoplasmic norepinephrine concentration was elevated by the reserpinelike agent Ro 4-1284. This release was independent from neural activity, not accompanied by NPY overflow, and suppressed by the uptake1 blocker desipramine. These findings are in keeping with carrier-mediated nonexocytotic norepinephrine release that is caused by reversal of the transport direction of the uptake1 carrier. During myocardial ischemia nonexocytotic norepinephrine release was accelerated and enhanced by inhibition of Na+,K(+)-ATPase before ischemia. This study demonstrates the potential of digitalis glycosides to interact both with transmitter exocytosis and with the neuronal catecholamine transport system by Na+,K(+)-ATPase inhibition. Interaction with the catecholamine transport system involves both inhibition of norepinephrine inward transport and induction of norepinephrine outward transport, resulting in nonexocytotic norepinephrine release.\r"

Gap junctions were visualized immunohistochemically with an antibody raised against a unique cytoplasmic epitope of connexin43, and the spatial distribution pattern was determined by three-dimensional reconstruction. The results demonstrate that from embryonic day 13 onward, connexin43 becomes detectable immunohistochemically in the myocardium of atria and ventricles. No expression is initially detectable in the myocardium of the sinus venosus, the sinoatrial node, the posterior wall of the atrium and pulmonary veins, the interatrial septum, the atrioventricular canal, including atrioventricular node and bundle, the interventricular septum, and the outflow tract. The developmental increase in the density of gap junctions in atria and ventricles of prenatal hearts correlates well with the reported developmental increase in conduction velocity. Whereas connexin43 becomes expressed in the derivatives of the sinus venosus (except for the sinoatrial node) and in the subepicardial layer of the ventricular free wall shortly before birth, it remains undetectable in the atrioventricular node and bundle and the proximal part of the ventricular conduction tissue, even in the adult heart. The apparent absence of an abundant expression of connexin43 at a location with a supposedly high conduction velocity (i.e., the atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches) is unexpected. These observations were confirmed in studies of the adult mouse heart, which showed, in addition, that connexin32 is not expressed in any part of the heart.\r"

During stimulation at 1 Hz, clinically relevant ETOH correlations (0.1-0.15% [vol/vol]) caused a 10-15% decrease in the contraction amplitude, measured by myocyte edge tracking, without decreasing the Cai transient that initiates contraction. At higher ETOH concentrations (1-5% [vol/vol]), ETOH caused profound contractile depression and also reduced the magnitude of the Cai transient. These effects were reversed within minutes of ETOH washout. Addition of norepinephrine (10 microM) to the bathing solution or an increase in bathing [Ca2+] in the continued presence of ETOH could also reverse its effects. The relation of the amplitude of the Cai transient to the contraction amplitude measured across a range of bathing [Ca2+] was shifted by ETOH, such that for a given Cai transient a marked reduction in contraction amplitude occurred. In unstimulated myocyte suspensions, ETOH (1-5% [vol/vol]) caused a concentration-dependent depletion of SR Ca2+ content, manifested as a diminution in the Cai increase elicited by caffeine in the presence of extracellular EGTA and no added Ca2+. Thus, in rat cardiac myocytes a reduction in the myofilament Ca2+ response, possibly due to a decrease in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, is a mechanism for contractile depression due to clinically relevant ETOH concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the generation of a neointima, an early step in the development of atherosclerosis, affects endothelium-dependent or -independent vasodilation. The neointima was induced, within 7 days, by positioning a nonocclusive silicone collar around one carotid artery in rabbits. After 1, 2, 7, or 14 days segments were cut from the collar-surrounded region of this artery as well as from the sham-operated contralateral artery and were used for isometric tension recording or for bioassay of nitric oxide (NO). The acetylcholine-induced release of NO was significantly reduced at 7 days. The tension recordings suggested that this already occurred at the earliest stages of neointima formation. Neither the capacity of the endothelial cells to form NO in response to the calcium ionophore A23187 nor the capacity of the underlying smooth muscle cells to relax in response to sources of exogenous NO (3-morpholinosydnonimine and nitroglycerin) was affected by the neointima. Therefore, the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine are presumably due to a defect at the level of the endothelial muscarinic receptors. The presence of a fully developed neointima did not alter the responsiveness to isoproterenol and forskolin but enhanced prostacyclin-mediated responses (assessed by iloprost and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid). These results illustrate selective alterations of endothelial and smooth muscle cell function in intima generation before fatty streak formation.\r"

  ".U": "91243308\r", 
  ".W": "The present investigation studied the effect of increasing severities of ischemic injury on recovery of oxidative metabolism after reperfusion in isolated rat hearts perfused retrogradely with erythrocyte-containing medium. Hearts subjected to 60 minutes of low-flow ischemia (5% of control perfusion) exhibited delayed but sustained recovery of left ventricular pressure development during reperfusion and preservation of ultrastructure delineated with electron microscopy. Immediately after reperfusion, myocardial oxygen consumption returned to control values, well before left ventricular pressure development recovered. Early after reperfusion release of 14CO2 from [1-14C]palmitate was reduced (-53%, p less than 0.01). Conversely, release of 14CO2 from [U-14C]glucose was increased (+131%, p less than 0.05). After 60 minutes of reperfusion 14CO2 release had completely returned to normal for both labeled substrates. Pulse-labeling experiments indicated that during transient depression of [1-14C]palmitate oxidation more tracer was incorporated into myocardial lipid esters, primarily triglycerides. In contrast to hearts subjected to low-flow ischemia, hearts subjected to 60 minutes of no-flow ischemia exhibited poor recovery of contractile function during the reperfusion period. Electron microscopic examination of reperfused hearts showed advanced myocyte damage consistent with irreversible injury. Interestingly, myocardial oxygen consumption in this group also recovered to control values. The substrate pattern during the early reperfusion period was similar to that of hearts subjected to low-flow ischemia. After 120 minutes of no-flow ischemia, recovery of oxidative metabolism was virtually absent. The results indicate a pronounced dissociation between recovery of oxidative metabolism and of contractile function in reperfused myocardium. The oxidative metabolic rate was disproportionately high compared with contractile function, not only in reversibly \"stunned\" hearts, but also in severely damaged hearts exhibiting signs of irreversible injury.\r"

  ".W": "Epicardial cells are more susceptible to the electrophysiological effects of ischemia than are endocardial cells. To explore the ionic basis for the differential electrophysiological responses to ischemia at the two sites, we used patch-clamp techniques to study the effects of ATP depletion on action potential duration and the ability of ATP-regulated K+ channels in single cells isolated from feline left ventricular endocardial and epicardial surfaces. During ATP depletion by treatment with 1 mM cyanide (CN-), shortening of action potential durations was significantly greater in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. Thirty minutes after initiating exposure to 1 mM CN-, action potential duration at 90% repolarization was reduced to 0.70 +/- 0.12 of the control value for endocardial cells versus 0.39 +/- 0.18 for epicardial cells (p less than 0.01), and action potential duration at 20% repolarization was reduced to 0.72 +/- 0.13 for endocardial cells versus 0.12 +/- 0.09 for epicardial cells (p less than 0.01). In both endocardial and epicardial cells, the shortening of action potential by CN- treatment was partially reversed by 0.3 microM glibenclamide; the magnitude of reversal, however, was much greater in epicardial cells. After exposure to 1 mM CN-, the activity of ATP-regulated K+ channels in cell-attached membrane patches was significantly greater in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. To study the dose-response relation between ATP concentration and open-state probability of the channels, intracellular surfaces of inside-out membrane patches containing ATP-regulated K+ channels were exposed to various concentrations of ATP (10-1,000 microM). The concentration of ATP that produced half-maximal inhibition of the channel was 23.6 +/- 21.9 microM in endocardial cells and 97.6 +/- 48.1 microM in epicardial cells (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that ATP-regulated K+ channels are activated by a smaller reduction in intracellular ATP in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. The differential ATP sensitivity of ATP-regulated K+ channels in endocardial and epicardial cells may be responsible for the differential shortening in action potentials during ischemia at the two sites.\r"

We also postulated that excess fluid within the myocardial interstitial space would potentiate interstitial fibrosis, thus further compromising function. Dogs were divided into three groups: 1) control, 2) chronic pulmonary hypertensive with right heart failure, and 3) chronic arterial hypertensive. The quantity of EVF, expressed as the unitless blood-free (wet weight-dry weight)/dry weight ratio, and interstitial fibrosis (collagen content) were determined and correlated with cardiac function at baseline and after acute elevation of coronary venous pressure and reduction of cardiac lymph flow. Control EVF was 2.90 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SD), which increased to 3.45 +/- 0.16 after acute (3-hour) elevation of coronary sinus pressure. This EVF significantly compromised cardiac function. The EVF in chronically hypertensive dogs and in dogs with chronic right heart pressure elevations was 3.50 +/- 0.30 and 3.50 +/- 0.08, respectively. End-diastolic left ventricular interstitial fluid pressure increased from a control value of 14.9 +/- 3.1 (at EVF = 2.9) to 24.8 +/- 3.7 (at EVF = 3.5). An EVF of 3.5 produced approximately 30% reduction of the heart's ability to maintain cardiac output at a left atrial pressure of 15 mm Hg. The compromised function in these chronic models is exacerbated after acute elevation of coronary venous pressure and reduction of cardiac lymph flow. Collagen levels were elevated by at least 20% in the chronic hypertensive dogs and in the nonhypertrophied left ventricles of dogs with chronic right heart pressure elevation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We therefore studied the effects of cGMP and guanylate cyclase stimulation on human platelet secretion by pharmacologically modulating intraplatelet cGMP levels. The endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF)-like activator of guanylate cyclase, S-nitrosocysteine (SNOC), led to a dose-dependent inhibition of secretion in intact human platelets (IC50 = 10(-6) M). The cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor M&B 22,948 augmented SNOC-induced inhibition of secretion through elevations in cGMP without affecting cAMP levels (from 50% to 81% inhibition versus control, p = 0.02). Methylene blue reversed the inhibitory effects of SNOC on platelet secretion (p = 0.03). Dibutyryl-cGMP and 8-bromo-cGMP also significantly inhibited secretion in this system. Incubation of platelets with exogenous cGMP to achieve intraplatelet cGMP levels comparable to those after SNOC treatment resulted in similar degrees of inhibition of secretion (32% inhibition versus control, p = 0.01) and was also potentiated by M&B 22,948 (from 32% to 68% inhibition, p = 0.003). In addition, a highly significant correlation between intraplatelet cGMP levels and the degree of inhibition of secretion was demonstrable in these studies (r = 0.94, p = 0.016). These data demonstrate that elevation of intraplatelet cGMP levels by the EDRF-like compound SNOC is correlated with inhibition of human platelet secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that canine ventricular epicardium and endocardium differ with respect to electrophysiological characteristics and pharmacological responsiveness and that these differences are in large part due to the presence of a prominent transient outward current Ito and a spike-and-dome morphology of the action potential in epicardium but not endocardium. In attempting to quantitate these differences and assess their gradation across the ventricular wall, we encountered a subpopulation of cells in the deep subepicardial layers with electrophysiological characteristics different from those of either epicardium or endocardium. These cells, which we have termed M cells, display a spike-and-dome morphology typical of epicardium but a maximal rate of rise of the action potential upstroke that is considerably greater than that of either epicardium or endocardium. Using the restitution of the amplitude of phase 1 of the action potential as a marker for the reactivation of Ito, we showed M cells to possess a prominent 4-aminopyridine-sensitive Ito with a reactivation time course characterized by two components with fast and slow time constants. The rate dependence of action potential duration of M cells was considerably more accentuated than that of epicardium or endocardium and more akin to that of Purkinje fibers (not observed histologically in this region). Phase 4 depolarization was never observed in M cells, not even after exposure to catecholamines and/or low [K+]o. In summary, our study presents evidence for the existence of a unique subpopulation of cells in the deep subepicardium of the canine left and right ventricles with electrophysiological features intermediate between those of conducting and myocardial cells. Although their function is unknown, M cells may facilitate conduction in epicardium and are likely to influence or mediate the manifestation of electrocardiographic J waves, T waves, U waves, and long QT intervals and contribute importantly to arrhythmogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The vertebrate heart contains two myosin heavy chain isoforms, alpha and beta, which are differentially expressed. To establish a murine model for gene-targeting experiments, we defined the precise temporal expression of the myosin isoforms during cardiogenesis and obtained quantitative measurements of cardiac performance. The relative levels of the alpha- and beta-cardiac transcripts were determined by isolating the RNA from the hearts of CD-1 mice during development and hybridizing the preparations to probes that detect specifically the alpha- or beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain mRNAs. The data indicate that, although both isoforms are present from the onset of cardiogenesis, the beta-isoform predominates during embryogenesis and fetal development. This relation is reversed after the first day of life with a significant drop in the absolute transcript levels during the switch; and alpha/beta ratio of 16:1 is maintained in the neonate, and the relatively high levels of the alpha-transcript remain throughout the adult stages. To be able to make functional comparisons between normal and transgenic mice, we obtained indexes of myocardial function in isolated retrogradely perfused and in work-performing heart preparations in normal and hypodynamic mouse hearts. We found that the physiology of the mouse heart is similar to the rat heart in that we observed a positive staircase in the force-frequency relation of the mouse Langendorff preparation. We also saw contractile responses of more than twice control induced by paired stimulation and persistent postextrasystolic potentiation. As is the case for the rat, in the work-performing mouse heart, afterload (Starling resistance, pressure) changes produced a steeper Starling function curve than did changes in preload (volume, venous return).\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have analyzed the high-fidelity surface electrocardiographic signal, and efforts have been made to increase the diagnostic sensitivity of the electrocardiogram by observing its high-frequency components. It was found that the high-frequency (150-250-Hz) electrocardiogram appears to detect evidence of transient ischemia with greater sensitivity than visual inspection of the surface electrocardiogram. A finite-element three-dimensional model of the ventricles with a self-similar (fractal) conduction system has been introduced as a bridge to the understanding of electrocardiographic phenomena related to high-frequency potentials. The model was activated, and the dipole potential generated by adjacent activated and resting cells was calculated to obtain a high-resolution QRS complex. Normal and ischemic activation processes was stimulated by regional reduction in conduction velocity. It was found that although the resulted low-frequency QRS complex was not significantly altered from normal conditions, the high-frequency components exhibited morphological changes similar to the ones observed during animal experiments and human studies. Based on the results obtained from the model, it can be concluded that these morphological changes can be attributed to a slowing of conduction velocity in the region of ischemia and that the model is adequate for meeting the challenges imposed by the requirements of high-frequency methods applied in clinical cardiology.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that 1) electrically induced fibrillation and defibrillation involve prolongation of refractoriness by the shock in addition to stimulation and 2) biphasic waveforms are more efficient for defibrillation than are comparable monophasic waveforms. The purpose of this study was to compare prolongation of action potential duration at 50% repolarization by monophasic and biphasic shocks during paced rhythm. A floating glass microelectrode was used to record intracellularly from the anterior right ventricular epicardium in seven open-chest dogs. After 10 S1 beats paced at an interval of 350 msec, 5-msec and 2.5-msec monophasic shocks and biphasic shocks, with each phase of 2.5 msec, were given via mesh electrodes on either side of the microelectrode. The shock strength was adjusted so that the shock field, measured from eight extracellular electrodes encircling the microelectrode, was about 5 V/cm. Monophasic and biphasic S2 shocks were given starting with an S1-S2 interval of 120 msec, which was increased in 5-msec steps until an action potential was produced by the S2 shock. Both monophasic and biphasic 5 V/cm shock fields caused significant prolongation of action potential duration. The prolongation of action potential duration increased as the S1-S2 interval increased. This prolongation occurred at shorter S1-S2 intervals for 5-msec monophasic shocks than for biphasic shocks.\r"

Ninety patients were randomly assigned to receive cimetidine or an identical placebo or to undergo antireflux surgery. During a six-month period, all groups improved clinically; the cimetidine and surgical groups improved more than the placebo group. The intake of pulmonary medication decreased significantly in both cimetidine and surgical groups. Pulmonary function test results improved in the cimetidine- and surgically treated patients; improvement was not statistically significant. At long-term follow-up, the surgical group maintained clinical improvement and decreased pulmonary medication intake, whereas the placebo group worsened. We conclude that gastroesophageal reflux can play a significant role in some patients with nonallergic pulmonary disease and that its treatment can improve pulmonary symptoms and objective measurements of pulmonary function.\r"

No significant differences with regard to GR mRNA expression was detected between the two groups examined. For comparison, lung tissue from three patients undergoing thoracic surgery was examined and found to contain GR mRNA levels in the same range. As an indication of GR function, we also determined the mRNA levels of a glucocorticoid-regulated gene, metallothionein IIA, during basal conditions and after in vitro incubation of PAM with dexamethasone. Neither the control sample nor the dexamethasone-stimulated MTII mRNA values in PAMs differed significantly between the two groups. Solution hybridization is a rapid, sensitive and convenient assay which enables accurate and specific quantitation of GR mRNA in PAM. The GR mRNA content and basal as well as dexamethasone-induced MTII mRNA levels in PAM from patients with sarcoidosis is not significantly different from those in healthy volunteers.\r"

Although invasive hemodynamic monitoring and preoperative optimization of cardiac status may lead to some reduction in the rate of perioperative cardiac events, the mortality from such events remains high. We report our experience with the use of perioperative intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in eight patients with unstable coronary syndromes or severe coronary artery disease who underwent urgent noncardiac surgery. There were no perioperative cardiac events while the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was in place. There were two postoperative cardiac events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure) in the first postoperative week after the IABP was removed. One patient required emergent femoral thrombectomy as a result of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and subsequently died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be considered as an adjunct to maintain hemodynamic stability for the high-risk cardiac patient about to undergo urgent or emergent noncardiac surgery.\r"

Crossover comparison of oxygenation status before and after aerosol or humidity therapy was done by analyzing P(A-a)O2 in these patients. We found that aerosols have a detrimental effect on the patient's oxygenation status, suggesting that humidity is preferable in maintaining adequate oxygenation in a patient with a normal lung plus artificial airway. The arterial pH and PaCO2 were not affected by aerosol therapy. Care should be exercised with regard to the adverse hypoxemic effect of bland aerosols when a large-reservoir jet nebulizer is used in an intubated patient who already has impaired cardiopulmonary function or borderline PaO2.\r"

From the CT scans, the mean percentage of pixels in the range -900 to -1,024 Hounsfield units, or pixel index, was determined for each subject. The highest correlations of pixel index with physiologic variables consistent with a diagnosis of emphysema were observed for CT taken at full expiration. In some subjects, the inspiratory CT would give a \"false positive\" for emphysema when the hyperaeration observed at inspiration was not observed at expiration. We believe that the CT scan taken at full expiration can effectively reveal the abnormal permanent enlargement of airspaces which defines emphysema and provides a noninvasive method of assessing lung morphology in the living human subject.\r"

The following dosages were administered with an interval of 1 h: 12-24-48-(48)-(48) micrograms for F and 100-200-400-400-(400)-(400) micrograms for S. The study day was discontinued if pulse rate was above 140 beats min-1, a flattening of T wave on the ECG was recorded, or a maximal bronchodilation in FEV1 was observed (above 110 percent of the predicted value or an increase in FEV1 in the last two measurements below 5 percent). The maximal individual dose of F administered was 84 micrograms in six patients, 132 micrograms in three patients, 180 micrograms in three patients, and 228 micrograms in one patient. For S, the maximal individual dose was 400 micrograms in three patients, 2,200 micrograms in eight patients, 3,000 micrograms in one patient, and 3,800 micrograms in one patient. The mean maximal increase in FEV1 was 36.0 percent after F and 35.1 percent after S. Pulse rate increased from 73 to S3 beats.min-1 after F and from 75 to 84 beats.min-1 after S (both statistically significant). No pulse rate above 140 beats.min-1 was observed. In the high-therapeutic range (up to 36 micrograms of F and 6,090 micrograms of S), no changes in potassium level were observed. In still higher dosages, mean potassium level decreased from 4.16 to 3.78 mmol.L-1 after F and from 4.02 to 3.88 mmol.L-1 after S (not clinically relevant). The lowest individual potassium level recorded was 3.1 mmol.L-1. No clinically important changes in ECG were observed. In conclusion, very high doses of F and S administered from a metered dose inhaler proved to be safe for patients.\r"

RESULTS: Caffeine (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced bronchoconstriction compared to placebo (p = 0.02). The reduction in bronchoconstriction correlated with the serum level of caffeine (p = 0.014).

The orthosis increased the posterior airway space, as assessed by lateral cephalograms. Seven months (range 2 to 25) after beginning use, 75 percent of patients were using the orthosis regularly. Snoring, by report, was improved in all patients but one (p less than 0.001) and was eliminated in 42 percent (95 percent confidence interval 30 to 55 percent). Sleep quality and sleepiness were also reported improved. Apneas and hypopneas, measured before and after use in 20 patients with obstructive sleep apnea, were reduced from an average of 47 to 20 events per hour (p less than 0.001). Oxygenation and sleep disturbance were also improved. Apnea-hypopnea frequency was reduced with treatment to less than 20/h in 13 patients. Residual frequencies greater than 20/h were associated with higher initial frequencies of apneas and hypopneas. Side effects of orthosis use were minor, and no serious complications were observed. The dental orthosis is an effective treatment for the symptom of snoring and can also effectively treat obstructive sleep apnea of moderate severity.\r"

Thirteen of the 37 patients had mean oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) less than 95 percent and a mean of ten or more episodes per hour when the dSaO2 was greater than or equal to 4 percent (4%dSaO2/h). In all, 26 of the 37 patients had evidence of significant multiple episodes of dSaO2 while asleep on BVs. Polysomnography performed on three of these patients substantiated the obstructive nature of the dSaO2. Twenty-two of the 37 patients who had a mean SaO2 of 90.6 +/- 7.2 percent and a mean of 17.7 +/- 16.1 4%dSaO2/h on BVs were switched to noninvasive ventilatory assistance by intermittent positive airway pressure (NV-PAP). Their mean SaO2 improved to 96.0 +/- 2.2 percent, and the 4%dSaO2/h decreased to 1.2 +/- 1.8 per hour. All symptoms similar to those of obstructive sleep apnea were relieved. We conclude that BV use is associated with significant dSaO2 in over 50 percent of patients. The dSaO2 is predominantly obstructive in nature but may be due to chronic underventilation in patients using less effective BVs. Patients with a mean SaO2 less than 95 percent or 10 or more 4%dSaO2/h may benefit from conversion to NV-PAP via the nose, the mouth, or an oral-nasal interface.\r"

The patients were retrospectively divided into two groups according to the time to peak myoglobin level during reperfusion. In 38 patients, myoglobin levels increased rapidly to a peak within 3 hours after reperfusion, after which it was cleared from the blood (group 1). Contrarily, a rise in myoglobin levels was persistent for 24 hours and its time to peak was greater than 3 hours after reperfusion in nine patients (group 2). There were no differences in preoperative and early reperfusion (within 1 hour of reperfusion) values of myoglobin between the two groups. At 3, 6, and 12 hours of reperfusion, myoglobin levels were significantly greater in group 2: 448 +/- 196 vs 1,149 +/- 900 ng/ml, 359 +/- 172 vs 2,653 +/- 3,179 ng/ml, 184 +/- 95 vs 1,896 +/- 1,387 ng/ml, respectively, p less than 0.0001 in each. The maximum activities of both myoglobin and CK-MB were significantly higher in group 2 (myoglobin-max: 771 +/- 257 vs 3,221 +/- 3,024 ng/ml, p less than 0.0001; CK-MBmax: 107 +/- 60 vs 227 +/- 219 IU/L, p less than 0.005). Five of nine patients in group 2 required post-operative assistance with intra-aortic balloon pumping (p less than 0.0005 compared with one of 38 in group 1) and perioperative myocardial infarction developed in three patients (33.3 percent) in this group (p less than 0.005 compared with 0 percent in group 1). Thus, patients with a delayed peak of serum myoglobin level exhibited detrimental cardiac failure postoperatively.

To this end, SvO2 and CI were measured before and during an infusion of enoximone and/or dobutamine in 30 patients with advanced heart failure. A nonlinear relationship was observed between SvO2 and CI with the nonlinear correlation coefficient being 0.52. On normalizing for individual differences in hemoglobin and oxygen consumption, this correlation coefficient became 0.90. Further analysis of individual data was performed using linear regression, and the slopes and correlation coefficients were found to span a wide range slope: -10.0 to 30.9 min-m2/L, r: -0.27 to 0.99). However, the mean slope and correlation coefficient for patients with baseline CI and SvO2 less than 21/min/m2 and less than 55 percent were 18.3 min-m2/L and 0.87, respectively, while those for the remainder of patients were only 3.1 min-m2/L and 0.42, respectively. Thus, the nonlinear correlation coefficient of the SvO2-CI relationship in a group of patients is dependent on the homogeneity of their oxygen consumption and hemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, the ability of SvO2 to serve as a therapeutic indicator in any given patient is dependent on baseline SvO2 and CI.\r"

Each of these cases occurred in the presence of good left ventricular function. The cases suggest this syndrome occurs in immunologically primed patients who have had prior cardiac injury resulting in readily available heart antibody. The first report followed an acute myocardial infarction that required a temporary pacemaker, and the two other cases occurred following coronary artery bypass surgery. Two of the patients had a history of distant myocardial or pericardial injury, and the third patient had an acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction two to three weeks before cardiac surgery. All three patients with pulmonary edema responded dramatically to corticosteroids, having been resistant to diuretic and pre-load and afterload reduction therapy, suggesting an autoimmune capillary injury process. Early recognition of such a syndrome is important since all three patients were successfully treated, and might otherwise have been confused with other causes of pulmonary edema.\r"

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of 100 patients receiving theophylline who had electrocardiograms at the time STC had been obtained. Categorization was based on STC without knowledge of clinical status: group 1 (25) had STC less than 2.5 mg/L; group 2 (25), STC greater than or equal to 2.5 less than 10 (6.2 +/- 0.4) mg/L; group 3 (25), STC greater than or equal to 10 less than or equal to 20 (15.8 +/- 0.4) mg/L; and group 4 (25), STC greater than 20 (27.8 +/- 1.1) mg/L. SETTING: A university-affiliated teaching hospital. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients were receiving theophylline in an oral form, with a similar distribution found in all groups. Groups were not different with respect to age, clinical diagnoses, electrocardiographic patterns, arterial pH or gases, serum calcium, or treatment with beta-agonists. Although fewer patients in group 1 were receiving steroids than those in the other groups, and serum potassium was lower in group 3 than in group 1 (4.0 +/- 0.6 vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 mEq/L, p less than 0.05), on multivariate analysis, serum potassium was not an independent predictor of arrhythmia, and treatment with steroids or digoxin was, at most, only weakly associated with the presence of arrhythmia. Heart rate was directly related to STC (r = 0.64, p less than 0.01), and STC was the strongest independent predictor of arrhythmia in this population. Although only 20 percent of patients in group 1 or 2 had arrhythmias, 48 percent of group 3 (p less than 0.05) and 56 percent of group 4 (p less than 0.05) had this finding. Moreover, the odds ratio of group 3 having an arrhythmia compared with group 1 was 3.7, 1.5 to 11.7, p less than 0.01. Multifocal atrial tachycardia was found in 8 percent of the patients in group 3 and 16 percent in group 4 but in none of the patients in groups 1 or 2. Two patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia died suddenly within 24 hours of having their STC measurement; none had concomitant ventricular ectopy. CONCLUSION: Theophylline causes tachycardia and serious arrhythmias even at STC considered to be therapeutic. Multifocal atrial tachycardia, an arrhythmia associated with use of this drug, may herald sudden cardiac death.\r"

  ".W": "The Southwest Oncology Group formed a database of 2,501 patients consecutively enrolled in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) trials since 1976. This report summarizes an analysis of this database to determine predictors of 2- and 5-year survival in limited stage disease (LD) and 1- and 2-year survival in extensive stage disease (ED). In addition, we analyzed the frequency of late recurrences, toxicity, and quality of life issues in the long-term survivors. For consecutive studies, greater than or equal to 2-year survival in LD were 15 percent, 21 percent, 28 percent, and 43 percent; 5-year survivals were 5 percent, 9 percent, 8 percent, and 20 percent. In ED, greater than or equal to 1-year survivals were 27 percent, 23 percent, 21 percent, and 42 percent; greater than or equal to 2-year survivals were 6 percent, 5 percent, 3 percent, and 19 percent. Using the logistic regression multivariate model, independent favorable predictors of 5-year survival for patients accrued to our older LD trials were normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values and good performance status. Therapy as employed in these trials was not an independent factor. However, if patients enrolled on more recent trials were included, 2-year predictors could be assessed. Therapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy and female gender then became additional independent favorable predictors. In ED, a single metastatic site and a normal LHH value were favorable predictors of survival beyond 1 year. The retrospective review of 63 patients with LD who survived at least 5 years found 33 asymptomatic patients with no recurrent disease; 6 with recurrent SCLC, 3 of whom died; 7 who died of non-cancer-related causes or unknown causes; 3 who died of secondary primary lung cancer; and 14 alive with persistent central nervous system symptoms and signs, possibly due to prophylactic brain radiation as given in the first 3 trials. No increased incidence of this syndrome has yet been observed in subsequent trials. For ED patients, 25 of 51 survivors greater than or equal to 2 years subsequently died of recurrent SCLC. The majority of the long-term survivors with ED (35 of 51) had either a single metastatic site or metastases limited to opposite side of the chest or regional nodes. Our multivariate models support the conclusion that aggressive combined modality, concurrent induction therapy, along with favorable prognostic variables, independently contribute to the improved long-term survival we have observed in LD. Longer follow-up is required to confirm that this improvement has occurred with less late toxicity.\r"

We performed a total of 326 sIL-2R serum assays in 126 patients with lung cancer (67 at diagnosis, 59 during and after treatment), 112 patients with pulmonary benign diseases, and 63 voluntary healthy subjects. Patients with lung cancer had a median value of sIL-2R of 791 U/ml, which was superior to that of both controls (398 U/ml, p less than 0.001) and patients with noninflammatory benign diseases (583 U/ml, p less than 0.02). However, infectious pulmonary disorders, such as tuberculosis and pneumonia, were associated with the highest values of the substance (median, 1150 U/ml; p less than 0.001). At the diagnosis of lung cancer, sIL-2R correlated neither with the stage of disease nor with the cell type. On the contrary, posttreatment levels of the receptor were significantly related to disease status (RO = .41, p less than 0.002), particularly in the subgroup of nonsurgical patients (RO = .48, p less than 0.001). Patients with abnormal sIL-2R levels had a nearly significant reduction in survival as compared with patients with normal values (p less than 0.1). Measurements of sIL-2R could be useful in monitoring patients under treatment for bronchogenic carcinoma, as well as in prognostication. In this setting, sIL-2R might open a new class of biologic markers, providing information that is complementary to those of the more classic tumor-derived markers.\r"

The slope (b) of the VO2-DO2 regression line VO2 = b x DO2 + a ranged from -0.10 to 0.08 (mean, 0.02 +/- 0.01, p less than 0.05) and was statistically significant in two patients (b = 0.05 and b = 0.08, p less than 0.05).

The respiratory data showed a 35 percent decrease of PIP and a 32 percent decrease of VTi and VTe with Pc-IRV 4:1 compared with CPPV. Hemodynamic parameters showed a significant incrase in CI (17 percent) in Pc-IRV 4:1, without change in REF. Observing in retrospect the pressure-volume relationship of the RV, we could differentiate a preload (group 1) and an afterload dependent group of patients (group 2), CI was significantly different in the two groups as it rose only in the preload-dependent patients. RVEDVI showed a significant change in group 1, whereas this was absent in the second group. REF was maintained in switching ventilation from CPPV to Pc-IRV with increasing I:E ratio. Pc-IRV appears to be a good alternative ventilatory mode in comparison with CPPV in a selected group of patients with preload dependency (responders); in these patients with respiratory insufficiency, close hemodynamic monitoring is required to optimize ventilation, especially in relation to the hemodynamic effects.\r"

A descriptive analysis of utilization of pulmonary artery catheters in a medical/surgical ICU population was performed in a university-affiliated hospital (24-bed medical/surgical ICU). The subjects included 154 medical/surgical patients judged by ICU residents and attendings to require PAC. All 154 patients underwent PAC with four patients having more than one catheterization. Prior to insertion of the catheter, a questionnaire was completed by medical/surgical residents and attendings indicating reasons for PAC insertion and estimate of hemodynamics. Following PAC, residents/attendings indicated their evaluation of hemodynamics and planned therapy. An expert panel rated performance of the house staff regarding treatment plan on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 indicating optimal therapy). The overall proportion correct classification for pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), CO, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were 47 percent, 51 percent, and 36 percent, respectively. In 45 percent of PAC, information obtained resulted in a major change in therapy. Major change in therapy occurred more often when prediction of PAWP by residents proved inaccurate. The expert panel judged appropriate scores of 3, 4 and 5 in 84 percent of the cases. Prediction of hemodynamics in ICU patients by clinical evaluation alone is inaccurate and unreliable. There is a positive correlation between inaccurate prediction of hemodynamics and major therapeutic changes after PAC. Most resident/attending performance was judged appropriate. Results of this study suggest that PAC was instrumental to the management scheme in many patients unresponsive to initial therapy. However, a subset of ICU patients were judged to have been managed favorably, yet had treatment based on inaccurate hemodynamic assessment.\r"

  ".W": "Sepsis syndrome frequently results in endothelial injury in many organ systems. To evaluate neutrophil-pulmonary endothelial cell interaction in the sepsis syndrome, we studied 39 critically ill patients prospectively and 20 normal volunteers. Thirteen patients with sepsis (mean age, 71.4 years), 14 patients in an intensive care unit control group (mean age 65.4 years), and 12 patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction (mean age, 66.8 years) were evaluated. Blood samples were drawn from septic patients within 24 hours and from ICU and MI patients within 72 hours of admission. All sepsis patients were culture positive, 6 of 13 from the blood. Both renal failure and ARDS developed in 54 percent of septic patients. 51Cr-labelled neutrophils were prepared and added to bovine pulmonary endothelial cell monolayers with and without added phorbol myristate acetate. Endothelial cells with adherent PMA and nonadherent PMN's, were harvested and radioactivity in each fraction measured with a gamma scintillation counter. Baseline and maximally stimulated (PMA, 3.0 ng/ml) neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells were similar in all patients groups. However, in septic patients, PMA-stimulated PMN adherence was reduced at lower doses, most significantly in those who developed ARDS within 24 to 48 hours of admission (p less than 0.05). Seventy-one percent of patients who developed ARDS had reduced stimulated adherence (PMA 1.0 ng/ml) compared to 22 percent of critically ill patients who did not. We conclude that diminished adherence of neutrophils to endothelium in response to low-level PMA stimulation is significantly more common in patients with sepsis who develop ARDS. Our findings suggest that PMN-endothelial cell interaction is altered by the time sepsis is clinically recognized but before the development of ARDS. We speculate that the observed reduction in adherence of the PMN to endothelial cells may be a consequence of down-regulation by mediators generated in the inflammatory response to sepsis and/or the need for active participation of septic endothelium in this interaction.\r"

Nitrogen balance also improved during GH treatment (+1.6 +/- 0.7 g/day on diet alone vs +3.8 +/- 0.5 g/day on diet plus GH, p less than 0.02). Maximal inspiratory pressure improved by 27 +/- 8 percent after GH treatment (p less than 0.02). No significant adverse effects occurred.

It is believed that this is the first case of localized bullous lung disease to be reported in association with any degree of AAT deficiency. There is evidence that the cystic lesions progressed to form upper lobe bullae. It is postulated that the AAT deficiency may have played a role in this progression, as did the patient's cigarette smoking. Following two instances of surgery, CT scans of the lungs, compliance studies and complete pulmonary function tests show no further evidence of lung bullae or emphysema. The rarity of the Z variant of AAT in blacks is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91243551\r", 
  ".W": "Between August 1988 and September 1989, 100 consecutive patients who underwent elective abdominal colorectal surgical procedures were prospectively randomized to receive or not to receive metoclopramide. Metoclopramide was intravenously administered every 8 hours from the completion of surgery until a solid food diet was able to be tolerated. Seven patients were not included in the final tabulations because of one death, one small bowel obstruction requiring laparotomy, one anastomotic leak requiring laparotomy, and four protocol violations. Ninety-three patients, 37 men and 56 women (mean age, 59.5; range, 14-89 years) underwent 40 segmental colectomies, 13 total abdominal colectomies, 8 abdominoperineal resections, 8 ileoanal pouch procedures, 7 small bowel resections, and 17 other colorectal procedures. The 40 patients who received postoperative metoclopramide were in Group 1, and the 53 who did not were in Group 2. The mean length of time between laparotomy and commencement of oral fluid and oral solid intake in Groups 1 and 2 were 3.5 and 4.8 days, and 3.5 and 5.0 days, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). Prolonged ileus was seen in seven patients in Group 1 and in eight patients in Group 2. These differences were also not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). Prolonged ileus was defined as the need for nasogastric tube reinsertion or discontinuation of oral intake. We conclude that metoclopramide does not significantly alter the course of postoperative ileus.\r"

  ".U": "91243552\r", 
  ".W": "Bowel anastomoses are conventionally performed using a handsewn technique or a stapling device. Each has potential benefits and disadvantages. The most clinically significant complications of the bowel anastomosis are anastomotic leakage and stricture formation. The indices of healing and tissue cohesion were compared dynamically over time in 24 dogs randomized to undergo either a standard two-layer handsewn anastomosis or a stapled anastomosis with the Premium CEEA (United States Surgical Corporation, Norwalk, CT). Animals were sacrificed at 1, 4, 7, and 28 days postoperatively. Each anastomosis was evaluated for anastomotic index, burst pressure, collagen content, and histologic appearance. The anastomotic index was similar on postoperative day (POD) 1, 4, and 7; but on day 28 all handsewn anastomoses had larger diameters than the widest CEEA anastomosis. Burst pressure was higher in handsewn anastomoses at all intervals. Collagen content tended to be higher on POD 7 in the CEEA anastomoses. Histological evaluation showed more complete epithelialization and less inflammation in handsewn anastomoses on POD 28. The higher level of collagen in the CEEA anastomoses on POD 7 may be implicated in the tendency toward stricture formation found with this type of anastomosis. This study demonstrates that the greater speed and ease of the stapled anastomosis is offset by the greater strength, reduced tendency to stricture, and more complete healing of the handsewn anastomosis.\r"

Changes in nuclear morphometric parameters have also been shown to correlate with prognosis in a variety of noncolorectal cancers. The association of nuclear morphometry with prognostic indicators in rectal cancer has not been well studied. Measurements of the nuclear area, perimeter, longest cord, and circularity factor from 39 primary rectal adenocarcinomas were compared with DNA content, degree of tumor differentiation, Dukes' class, and patient survival. Nuclear circularity was found to correlate with DNA ploidy. Nondiploid tumors with a DNA index greater than 1.3 had significantly more circular nuclei than tumors with diploid or near-diploid DNA content. There was no correlation between nuclear morphometry and Dukes' class or patient survival. Significant increases in DNA content of rectal cancers appear to be reflected by measurable changes in nuclear shape. Nuclear morphometric measurements may provide useful information in the study of the progression of neoplastic changes in colorectal cancer.\r"

Four patients experienced complete relief of symptoms and the remaining two patients had marked improvement. Although macroscopic healing of the ulcer was apparent in all, histologic improvement was not appreciable. Five of the six patients remain in remission during a follow-up period of 4-14 months (mean, 8 +/- 1.5 months). Recurrence was observed in one patient at 5 months, which satisfactorily resolved with sucralfate enemas. From these preliminary observations we infer that solitary rectal ulcer can be effectively treated with topical application of sucralfate.\r"

The studies included: 1) the comparison between SW 480 and CC-ML3 in morphology, growth kinetics, seeding and plating efficiency, and karyotype; and 2) carcino-embryonic antigen determination, origination, and metastatic ability of CC-ML3. The results showed that CC-ML3 was significantly different from SW480 in vitro and possessed a high metastatic potential in vivo. This newly developed animal model may thus be useful for studying the biology and pathogenesis of metastasis of human colonic cancer.\r"

Four other methods have gained acceptance by the majority of respondents in both groups: colon transit studies, defecography, perfused-catheter manometry, and rectal compliance. The three methods ranked lowest in availability, actual use, and helpfulness by both groups were single-fiber electromyography, use of a perineometer, and evoked potential studies. Our study provides a baseline for future surveys on the investigative efforts of physicians studying the physiology of the colon, rectum, and anus.\r"

  ".W": "The pelvic-pouch procedure has become a standard operation for selected patients with ulcerative colitis, but is contraindicated in patients with Crohn's disease at our institution. However, the distinction between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis can sometimes be difficult, if not impossible. Between January 1982, and March 1989, 272 patients with ulcerative colitis underwent pelvic-pouch procedures at our institution. Nine (3.5 percent) of these patients eventually were found to have Crohn's disease. The records of these patients were examined to assess their clinical outcome and complication rate. There were five females and four males with a mean age of 28.8 years. In five patients (Group I) the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was made postoperatively on histologic examination of the rectum. The ileostomy was closed in all patients. Two developed complications necessitating excision of the pouch. Three patients are well. In the other four cases (Group II) the mean time to diagnosis was 2.5 years after the pouch procedure. Three patients developed pouch-vaginal fistula, and one multiple anal fissures and stenosis. Two required excision of the pouch whereas two have a functioning pouch but with a persistent pouch-vaginal fistula (n = 1) or anal fissures (n = 1). Overall, four patients have had their pouches removed, and five patients have functioning pouches: three with no complications and two with persistent perianal disease. Thus, we would conclude that the pelvic-pouch procedure should not knowingly be performed in patients with Crohn's disease because of the high associated complication rate.\r"

The indications for operation were sphincter destruction secondary to multiple fistulotomies (n = 4), bilateral pudendal nerve damage (n = 2), and high imperforate anus (n = 1). The procedure is performed without the use of a diverting colostomy. The inferior portion of the origin of each gluteus maximus is detached from the sacrum and coccyx, bifurcated, and tunneled subcutaneously to encircle the anus. The ends are then sutured together to form two opposing slings of voluntary muscle. Postoperatively, six patients regained continence to solid stool, two to liquid stool as well, and only one patient in this group was able to control flatus. Although resting pressures remained unchanged, voluntary squeeze pressures were restored by this operation. In addition, rectal sensation was markedly improved, which helps make this a worthwhile procedure for properly selected patients.\r"

  ".U": "91243561\r", 
  ".W": "Fifteen consecutive patients (nine males and six females) who underwent construction of a double-stapled ileoanal reservoir (DS-IAR) were prospectively evaluated. Mean and maximal resting pressures preoperatively, before ileostomy closure, and at 12 months, were 53 and 84 mm Hg, 39 and 62 mm Hg, and 62 and 81 mm Hg. Mean and maximal squeeze pressures at those same time periods were 96 and 153 mm Hg, 111 and 173 mm Hg, and 95 and 168 mm Hg. There were no significant decreases in either resting or squeeze pressure between preoperative values and those obtained 12 months after surgery. However, the length of the high pressure zone decreased from 3.8 cm preoperatively to 2.3 cm at 12 months. This reflects the sacrifice of the cephalad 1.5 cm of the internal anal sphincter necessary to effect this anastomosis at a mean of 1.4 cm from the dentate line. However, this maneuver did not result in poor continence. Eleven patients whose ileostomies were closed for a mean of 9 months, ranging from 3 to 15 months, were evaluated regarding functional outcome. Only one patient had any incontinence and this patient had incomplete circular-stapled tissue rings, which necessitated transanal suture repair of the anastomotic defect. Similarly, three of the four patients who sometimes or rarely use a pad at night had transanal-suture reinforcement. Ten of the 11 patients never wear a pad during the day. No pelvic or perianal sepsis occurred. Stratified squamous epithelium was found in 6 of the 13 distal stapler \"donuts\" that were examined. In addition, 10 patients underwent biopsy of the tissue immediately caudad to the circular staple line at the time of ileostomy closure; in five, only stratified squamous epithelium was noted. The DS-IAR is associated with excellent objective physiologic and subjective functional results.\r"

  ".W": "The primary role that tumor markers for cancer of the colon and rectum have at this time is for postoperative surveillance of those patients resected for cure who are at risk for recurrence of the disease. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels are followed by most surgeons prospectively after the potentially curative resection. This tumor marker has not been advocated as a screening test for these cancers; however, a preoperative CEA serum level is determined in those patients before the initial surgery for colon or rectal cancer. The serum level of CEA is mainly determined by tumor differentiation and stage of disease. If the CEA serum level begins to increase during the postoperative surveillance period, the recurrence of colon or rectal cancer must be suspected. Further investigations are then performed to identify the location and resectability of the recurrent disease. Monoclonal antibodies labeled with radioisotope are presently being used clinically to identify recurrence of colon and rectal cancer. Used in conjunction with elevated serum CEA levels (or other determinants of recurrent disease) these tumor markers can specifically identify site(s) of cancer recurrence. Theoretically, by attaching cancer-fighting agents (i.e., chemotherapeutic agents) to the monoclonal antibody, the site of tumor recurrence can be potentially treated, too. Hence, these \"tumor-seeking missiles\" may one day be used to treat cancer recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "The development of mechanical ventilators and the procedures for their application began with the simple foot pump developed by Fell O'Dwyer in 1888. Ventilators have progressed through three generations, beginning with intermittent positive pressure breathing units such as the Bird and Bennett device in the 1960s. These were followed by second-generation units--represented by the Bennett MA-2 ventilator--in the 1970s, and the third-generation microprocessor-controlled units of today. During this evolutionary process clinicians recognized Types I and II respiratory failure as being indicators for mechanical ventilatory support. More recently investigators have expanded, clarified, and clinically applied the physiology of the work of breathing (described by Julius Comroe and other pioneers) to muscle fatigue, requiring ventilatory support. A ventilator classification system can help the clinician understand how ventilators function and under what conditions they may fail to operate as desired. Pressure-support ventilation is an example of how industry has responded to a clinical need--that is, to unload the work of breathing. All positive pressure ventilators generate tidal volumes by using power sources such as medical gas cylinders, air compressors, electrically driven turbines, or piston driven motors. Positive end-expiratory pressures, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, pressure support ventilation, pressure release ventilation, and mandatory minute ventilation, are examples of the special functions available on modern ventilators. Modern third-generation ventilators use microprocessors to control operational functions and monitors. Because these units have incorporated the experience learned from earlier ventilators, it is imperative that clinicians understand basic ventilator operation and application in order to most effectively prescribe and assess their use.\r"

The pertinent results included the mean fasting plasma glucose levels of control, Sprague-Dawley (C), of transplanted BB/Wor dp (T), and nontransplanted, insulin treated, diabetic BB/Wor dp (D), and they were, respectively, 97 +/- 4 mg/dl, 110 +/- 3 mg/dl, and 350 +/- 40 mg/dl. Fasting plasma insulin levels in C and T rats were 21.9 +/- 3 microU/ml, and 20.4 +/- 2 microU/ml, respectively. Fasting plasma glucagon levels in C, T, and D, were 37.8 +/- 5.7 pg/ml, 43.4 +/- 4.6 pg/ml, and 47.4 +/- 4.9 pg/ml, respectively. During oral glucose tolerance test, the pattern of insulin secretion in the C and T rats was identical with a peak attained at 15 min. Glucose caused a 70% suppression of plasma glucagon levels in C rats (P less than 0.01); T rats suppressed 14%, but this was not statistically significant; D rats failed to suppress. Glipizide plus glucose caused an improved glucose tolerance in T rats without significantly affecting insulin levels. In the same rats, glipizide resulted in a significant suppression of glucagon compared with levels in the presence of glucose alone. Arginine caused a minimal release of insulin in T rats and a major glucagon secretory response in D rats. Pancreatic glucagon content was significantly (P less than 0.03) lower in C and T, compared with D rats. Furthermore, the transplanted testes of T contained substantial amounts of glucagon. In summary, these data suggest that grafted testes in spontaneously diabetic BB/Wor dp rats contain both beta and alpha-cells and that these cells have the capacity to respond to specific secretagogues independently.\r"

Empty or estradiol-filled Silastic capsules were implanted sc into pseudopregnant rabbits (day 0). Ten days later (day 10), peripheral blood was obtained via the marginal ear vein, and Silastic capsules were removed. Twenty-four hours after capsule removal (day 11), blood samples were obtained and ovaries removed for in vitro perfusion. The artery and vein of each ovary were individually cannulated, and ovaries were perfused in vitro for 6 h. Mean progesterone secretion rates were determined from perfusate samples taken every 30 min. On day 10, serum progesterone concentrations were similar in control and estradiol-treated animals. On day 11, 24 h after withdrawal of Silastic capsules, serum progesterone concentration in the estradiol-treated rabbits decreased significantly compared to controls. The withdrawal of estradiol also significantly reduced the secretion of progesterone by in vitro perfused ovaries in estradiol-withdrawn rabbits compared to empty capsule controls. Addition of estradiol or 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) to the perfusion medium significantly increased progesterone secretion by ovaries from estradiol-withdrawn rabbits but not to control values. In contrast, a combination of estradiol plus 25-OH restored progesterone secretion to control levels. Although estradiol together with 25-OH stimulated progesterone secretion 24 h after estradiol withdrawal, progesterone secretion in vitro was unaffected 48 h after capsule removal, whereas pregnenolone stimulated secretion 5-fold. These results demonstrate that estradiol has a direct and acute stimulatory effect on progesterone secretion by the rabbit corpus luteum.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported previously that anterior pituitary cells released interleukin-6 (IL-6) and that this release was stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), or agents that increased intracellular cAMP concentrations. We now report that IL-1 stimulates IL-6 release from anterior pituitary cells in vitro. IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta (0.04-25 ng/ml) significantly increased IL-6 release 3- to 4-fold in a concentration-related manner during 6-h incubations; however, there was no change in extracellular or intracellular cAMP concentrations. IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta (10 ng/ml), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP, 500 nM), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 1 microM), and LPS (1 ng/ml) stimulated IL-6 release to a similar degree. In the presence of VIP and PGE2, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta increased IL-6 release without any apparent further change in extracellular or intracellular cAMP. Conversely, LPS did not increase cAMP concentrations, and IL-1 did not significantly increase IL-6 release in the presence of LPS. The preexposure of anterior pituitary cells to 1 microM PMA caused the apparent down-regulation of protein kinase C activity because 100 nM PMA was no longer effective to stimulate IL-6 release; however, the ability of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, PGE2, or LPS to stimulate IL-6 release was not altered. In addition, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta stimulated IL-6 release in the presence of maximally stimulative concentrations of PMA. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (10 nM) significantly inhibited IL-6 release induced by IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, or LPS. The separation of anterior pituitary cells on unit gravity BSA gradients generated fractions of IL-6-producing cells that were inducible by LPS and IL-1 beta and separate from the PRL-, ACTH-, GH-, or LH-producing cell fractions. These data suggest that IL-1 stimulates IL-6 release from a subpopulation of anterior pituitary cells via a glucocorticoid-sensitive and non-cAMP-mediated pathway that is different from those pathways used by VIP, PGE2, and PMA.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and the abundance of hepatic IGFBP-1 mRNA are increased in streptozotocin-diabetic rats and are regulated in accordance with insulin and metabolic status. We recently purified rat IGFBP-1 from medium conditioned by well differentiated rat H4IIE hepatoma cells. Since this cell line provides a useful model for examining the effects of hormones on hepatocellular function, we used H4IIE cells to examine the relative role that insulin and other factors may play in the regulation of IGFBP-1 production. H4IIE cells were stabilized in serum-free medium, then treated with specific hormones. The availability of IGFBPs in conditioned medium was estimated by [125I]IGF-I binding assay, and specific BPs were assessed by Western ligand and immunoblot analyses. The abundance of IGFBP-1 mRNA was determined by Northern and slot blot analysis. Initial studies revealed that [125I]IGF-I-binding activity in conditioned medium was reduced after 24-h incubation with 100 nM insulin (52 +/- 4% of control; P less than 0.001). In contrast, binding activity was increased after only 4 h of incubation with 75 microM 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP) or 1 microM dexamethasone (P less than 0.001 vs. control for each), but these effects were prevented by insulin. Ligand and immunoblotting demonstrated that insulin decreased the production of 32K and 34K forms of IGFBP-1, while both 8-CPT-cAMP and dexamethasone increased the production of IGFBP-1; again, insulin prevented the effects of 8-CPT-cAMP and dexamethasone. Of note, 1 microM rat GH, testosterone, progesterone, or 17 beta-estradiol had no effect on either IGF-binding activity or IGFBP-1 production. Northern and slot blot analyses revealed that 100 nM insulin profoundly lowered the abundance of IGFBP-1 mRNA in H4IIE cells (4 +/- 0.6% of control at 4 h; P less than 0.001), while IGFBP-1 mRNA was increased 2-fold during incubation with 75 microM 8-CPT-cAMP (P less than 0.001) and 9-fold with 1 microM dexamethasone (P less than 0.001). Once again, the effect of insulin was dominant; insulin both prevented and reversed the effects of maximally effective concentrations of 8-CPT-cAMP and dexamethasone. To determine whether this effect of insulin reflected altered generation or stability of IGFBP-1 mRNA, H4IIE cells were incubated with 2.5 micrograms/ml actinomycin-D with or without insulin, and mRNA was quantitated by Northern blot.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The rat preoptic area-anterior hypothalamic continuum (POA-AH) contains about 400-800 neurons that express the decapeptide GnRH and the 56-amino-acid GnRH-associated peptide. Originating from the olfactory placode, these neurons migrate and establish their final distribution and connections in the POA-AH several days before birth. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the biosynthesis of the mRNA encoding the precursor (proGnRH) common to GnRH and GnRH-associated peptide undergoes postnatal changes corresponding to the development of sexual maturation. The POA-AH content of proGnRH messenger RNA (mRNA) was followed from postnatal day 1 to day 90 in female and male Sprague-Dawley rats killed by decapitation between 1000-1200 h. Cytoplasmic RNA fractionated from individual POA-AH homogenates was purified using proteinase K digestion. Cytoplasmic proGnRH mRNA was quantitated simultaneously with cyclophilin mRNA (an internal standard control) using solution hybridization-RNase protection assay, with the protected fragments separated through polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the POA-AH, the concentrations of proGnRH mRNA (femtograms mRNA per microgram total RNA) increased significantly with age in both sexes (P less than 0.001). In males, proGnRH mRNA levels increased by day 30 some 2-fold over the values of days 5 and 10, and the levels established on day 30 were maintained through adulthood. In females, the first rise in proGnRH mRNA levels occurred on day 30, followed by an additional increase on day 45 to levels seen in adulthood. Levels of proGnRH mRNA established in adulthood were significantly higher in females than in males (P less than 0.03). The concentrations of cyclophilin mRNA (picograms mRNA per microgram total RNA) remained essentially unchanged in both sexes during the same period of time when proGnRH mRNA levels were increasing. These results provide evidence for postnatal sex-related increases in the levels of proGnRH mRNA in the rat POA-AH, which are likely to reflect differential regulation by gonadal steroids.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical observations have demonstrated a positive effect of estrogens and androgens on the maintenance of structural bone integrity. This study examines the direct effects of androgenic hormones on the osteoblast-like human osteosarcoma cell line, HOS TE85. Employing radiolabeled dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 2800 saturable, high-affinity (dissociation constant = 0.66 nM) androgen binding sites were detected per HOS TE85 cell. Androgen binding was specific in that DHT and testosterone (T) displayed significantly greater competition than the progestins, progesterone and medroxyprogesterone. The expression of androgen receptors in HOS TE85 cells was further substantiated by Northern analysis. A human androgen receptor complementary DNA probe revealed a 9.5 kilobase transcript which corresponds to the predominant human androgen receptor transcript detected in human male reproductive tissues. Androgens were also found to elicit biological responses in HOS TE85 cells. Physiological concentrations of DHT and T decreased HOS TE85 cell proliferation as assessed by cell count. This finding suggests that DHT may also play a role in osteoblast differentiation. In support of this hypothesis, treatment with T (24 h, 10 nM) enhanced the abundance of both alpha 1(I)-procollagen messenger RNA (mRNA) (5-fold) and transforming growth factor-beta mRNA (2.2 fold). The nonaromatizable androgen DHT (24 h, 10 nM) elicited an increase in the steady state concentration of alpha 1(I)-procollagen mRNA similar to the increase observed with T treatment. Thus, in addition to the recent discovery of estradiol receptors and estrogenic regulation of HOS TE85 cells, it is now evident that these osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells also express high affinity androgen binding sites and can respond biologically to androgens.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that stimulation of cultured beating cardiac myocytes with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) produces increased beating frequency, increased cellular cAMP concentration, and a homologous desensitization of the cAMP-elevating action of CGRP. In the present study, the characteristics and regulation of [125I]CGRP binding sites in cultured cardiac myocytes were investigated. Binding of [125I] CGRP to membranes prepared from these cells was selective, saturable, and of high affinity. Scatchard transformation of the saturation isotherm generated a linear plot suggesting the existence of a homogeneous population of binding sites with an equilibrium binding constant of 41 +/- 7 pM and maximum binding capacity of 31 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein. Binding of [125I]CGRP to membranes was inhibited completely by guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (250 microM), suggesting association of the binding sites with a G protein. Consistent with the saturation binding data, association kinetic studies indicated that [125I]CGRP associated with a single population of binding sites. Dissociation kinetic data, in contrast, indicated that [125I]CGRP dissociated from two affinity component sites on membranes, suggesting the existence of multiple affinity states of the G protein-coupled forms of the CGRP receptor. Nonequilibrium dissociation kinetic experiments revealed a time-dependent conversion of [125I] CGRP binding sites from a fast- to a slow-dissociating state. Desensitization of cells to CGRP by prior exposure to CGRP (10 nM) for 5 min reduced the maximal cAMP response of cells to further CGRP challenge and the number of [125I]CGRP binding sites in membranes prepared from these cells approximately 90% and 80%, respectively. These results demonstrate the existence of high affinity CGRP receptors in cardiac myocytes which appear coupled to G proteins and which undergo ligand-induced affinity alterations and desensitization-induced loss of receptor activity. The present findings also suggest the existence of multiple affinity states of the CGRP:receptor:G protein ternary complex.\r"

Obesity and hyperinsulinemia were observed in rats 21 days after VMH lesioning. IAPP content was increased in the islets of VMH-lesioned rats compared with findings in the sham-operated controls (100.9 +/- 6.6 vs. 72.8 +/- 3.85 fmol/islet; P less than 0.01). Isolated islets of VMH-lesioned rats secreted larger amounts of IAPP in the presence of 2.8 mM and 16.7 mM glucose (2.99 +/- 0.98 and 11.2 +/- 1.29 fmol.islet(-1).3 h-1) than was noted in sham-operated rats (ND and 6.65 +/- 0.78 fmol.islet(-1).3 h-1). In the obese Zucker rats, aged 14 weeks, IAPP concentrations in the islets were elevated compared with lean rats (133.3 +/- 10.6 vs. 84.4 +/- 8.5 fmol/islet; P less than 0.01). The isolated islets secreted larger amounts of IAPP in response to 2.8 mM and 16.7 mM glucose (2.83 +/- 0.88 and 15.81 +/- 1.35 fmol.islet(-1).3 h-1) than did those from lean control rats (0.36 +/- 0.19 and 12.49 +/- 1.20 fmol.islet(-1).3 h-1). These results strongly suggest that overproduction and hypersecretion of IAPP occur in animals with obesity and hyperinsulinemia.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and PTH with UMR 106 osteosarcoma cells was examined biochemically and morphologically. EGF inhibited PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in association with a reduction in PTH receptors and a decrease in the activity of the stimulatory guanyl nucleotide-binding protein (Gs). Universal inhibition of agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity did not occur, inasmuch as EGF did not reduce prostaglandin E2-enhanced enzyme activity. The influence of EGF on PTH action correlated with its effect in the UMR 106 cell population of promoting entry into the cell cycle. Morphological analysis with radioautography indicated that both EGF and PTH receptors could be colocalized to certain UMR 106 cells, but that each were more abundantly distributed over discrete UMR 106 cell types. Based on the distribution of [3H]thymidine incorporation, EGF receptors were predominantly found over rapidly proliferating cells, whereas PTH receptors were most densely distributed over more quiescent cells. The results indicate that EGF and PTH receptors are localized over specific types within the heterogeneous population of UMR 106 cells and suggest that EGF may reduce PTH action in these cultures by enhancing the proliferation of progenitor cells lacking PTH receptors and reducing differentiation in this cell population, which leads to PTH receptor-enriched target cells. EGF and PTH receptors may, therefore, be useful as probes to examine both functional interactions and differentiation pathways among cells in osteoblast models in vitro and perhaps in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "From the MtTF4 tumor of rat pituitary origin we established the F4Z2 cell line whose growth is stimulated by 17 beta-estradiol (E2). Taking E2 actions as references we investigated actions of other effectors on the proliferation, protein, and insulin growth factor-I (IGF-I) secretions of F4F2 cells. Dexamethasone (Dex) and L-T3 were chosen because they have also intracellular receptors and they act in pituitary cells. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented either with charcoal-treated fetal calf serum (CT-FCS) or with BSA and transferrin. Hormones were added at the time of seeding and cells were counted 2-10 days later without renewing the culture medium. The accumulation of immunoreactive IGF-I in conditioned medium was used as an index of IGF-I secretion. For studies on protein secretion, cells were incubated for 24 h with [35S]methionine and labeled proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We found that: 1) L-T3, like E2, stimulated in a dose-dependent and specific manner the proliferation of F4Z2 cells cultured in the presence of 5% CT-FCS; EC50 was: 1 X 10(-11) M and 0.2 X 10(-11) M for L-T3 and E2, respectively. In contrast, L-T3 but not E2 remained active in serum-free medium; 2) Dex was a strong inhibitor of cell proliferation in serum-free medium and in medium supplemented with 5% CT-FCS (EC50: 5 X 10(-9) M). The antiglucocorticoid RU 38 486 prevented this inhibitory effect; 3) when a stimulator (E2 or L-T3) was simultaneously incubated with the inhibitor (Dex) the number of cells depended on the ratio of hormone concentrations. When there was no large excess of one effector this number was intermediary between those counted in the presence of each hormone separately and L-T3 was more potent than E2 in preventing Dex inhibition; 4) Dex, E2, and L-T3 modified the electrophoretic patterns of secreted proteins but there was no evidence for a correlation between these modifications and the inhibition or the stimulation of cell proliferation, and 5) the accumulation of immunoreactive IGF-I was insensitive to E2, increased by L-T3, and markedly decreased by Dex. L-T3 but not E2 prevented the effect of Dex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The present study measured the pattern of tonic, basal LH release in the rabbit after passive immunoneutralization of endogenous NPY. Eight intact rabbits with third cerebroventricular cannulae and venous catheters were subjected to 8 h of blood sampling at 15-min intervals. Intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of 1 ml of either normal rabbit serum (NRS) or NPY antiserum (NPY-Ab; raised in rabbits against human NPY) was begun after the second hour of basal blood sampling and was continued for the remaining 6 h of the 8-h protocol. A 1-ml matching iv dose of NRS or NPY-Ab was administered at the start of the icv infusion. All rabbits received both NRS and NPY-Ab treatments 2 weeks apart in a Latin square design. Administration of NPY-Ab significantly (P less than 0.05) suppressed plasma LH after 165 min. After 4 h, plasma LH was maximally reduced to 42% of the control value (pretreatment, 0.093 +/- 0.016 ng/ml; 4 h, 0.039 +/- 0.005 ng/ml). A reduction in the rate of pulsatile LH release also occurred during NPY-Ab treatment (P less than 0.05). Treatment with NRS had no effect on LH. The experiment was repeated in four rabbits 2 weeks after ovariectomy. Administration of NPY-Ab suppressed plasma LH after 75 min in ovariectomized (OVX) rabbits (P less than 0.05). The greatest inhibition was seen after 5 h of NPY-Ab treatment, when LH was reduced to 21% of the control level (pretreatment, 0.841 +/- 0.274 ng/ml; 5 h, 0.134 +/- 0.025 ng/ml). Both LH-pulse amplitude and frequency were suppressed in these OVX does. To determine whether central actions of NPY are of predominant importance in maintaining LH secretion, four OVX rabbits were given NPY-Ab icv only. LH was suppressed after 90 min (P less than 0.05) and was maximally inhibited after 3 h of treatment to 22% of the control value (pretreatment, 1.804 +/- 0.711 ng/ml; 3 h, 0.434 +/- 0.221 ng/ml). Although both LH-pulse amplitude and frequency were diminished, neither was decreased significantly (P greater than 0.05). FSH secretion was not affected by NRS or NPY-Ab treatment in either intact or OVX does. These results clearly indicate that in both intact and OVX does, endogenous NPY is in part responsible for maintaining basal, tonic LH secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

If such animals were treated daily with a rabbit antirat PRL serum, their serum lactogenic activity diminished further; severe anemia and immunological anergy developed; and death occurred within 8 weeks. In contrast, untreated Hypox animals increased gradually their serum lactogenic activity, starting on the 7th week after pituitary removal, which rose up to 50% of control levels by week 9. Hypox animals showed normochromic normocytic anemia, a grossly reduced immunocompetence, decreased body, thymus, spleen, adrenal, and ovary weights, and decreased DNA and RNA synthesis in the thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. However, the condition of Hypox animals did not deteriorate further over the 9-week experimental period. All the hematological deficiencies and decrease in organ weights observed in Hypox rats were normalized after grafting with syngeneic pituitaries (SPG). These effects of SPG could be inhibited by additional treatment with antirat PRL serum. Treatment of Hypox animals with ovine PRL had a restoring effect similar to SPG, which was not inhibited by additional antirat PRL serum treatment. Rat and ovine PRL and GH and human placental lactogen all stimulated the incorporation of 3H-thymidine by rat bone marrow cells in vitro. These results indicate that PRL has a multiple trophic effect and is capable of maintaining vital bodily functions for long periods of time.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), a cytokine produced as one aspect of inflammatory reactions, on the intracellular free calcium concentration in single pituitary cells using a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye, indo-1, and a digital imaging fluorescence microscopic system. TNF alpha induced an increase in intracellular free calcium immediately after administration, reaching a peak after 30 sec and then returning to nearly the basal level after 120 sec in the pituitary cells. The cells responding to TNF alpha constitute about 15% of the pituitary cell population, and these cells never responded to the hypothalamic releasing hormones TRH, GnRH, GH-releasing hormone, or CRH. To define the role of calcium in TNF alpha-induced PRL release, dispersed pituitary cells were exposed to agents that modify TNF alpha-induced calcium mobilization. Such calcium channel blockers as cobalt and verapamil decreased basal and TNF alpha-induced PRL release. A low calcium medium also decreased TNF alpha-induced PRL release. These data suggest that intracellular calcium mobilization may be involved in the process of TNF alpha-induced PRL release.\r"

In the present study we evaluated that role of LHRH in this steroid-induced effect on opiate-responsiveness. Central administration to ovariectomized rats of native LHRH or the LHRH agonist [Des-Gly10]LHRH ethylamide causes a dose-dependent refractoriness to the hypothermic effects of morphine. The potency relationship of these two LHRH agonists in antagonizing morphine's effect was consistent with their potency in inducing LH release. Treatment of ovariectomized rats with estradiol benzoate and progesterone in a regimen which induces a preovulatory-like LH surge, antagonized morphine-induced hypothermia, and the LHRH antagonist [D-Phe2, Pro3, D-Phe6] LHRH, reversed the effects of the gonadal steroids. These results indicate that the LHRH secretory dynamics associated with the preovulatory surge of LH may serve to modulate opiate responsiveness and thereby could serve to couple behavioral, sensory, and autonomic events with this neuroendocrine response to gonadal steroids.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that Sertoli cells actively synthesize and secrete a nonspecific protease inhibitor in vitro; N-terminal sequence analysis, subunit structural analysis, and other biological studies revealed that this protein is the homolog of serum alpha 2-macroglobulin. We have now quantified the relative distribution of alpha 2-macroglobulin in the reproductive compartments and their comparison with nonreproductive organs. In serum and all nonreproductive tissues examined, the concentration of alpha 2-macroglobulin progressively decreased with advancing age. However, in both the testis and epididymis, the levels of this protein increased with the age of the animals. Serum alpha 2-macroglobulin levels were consistently higher than those in any other tissues until 60 days when the concentrations of this protein were the highest in the epididymis. The distribution of alpha 2-macroglobulin in various nonreproductive tissues from female rats was similar to that observed for male rats in that its levels tended to decrease with age. However, uterine levels of alpha 2-macroglobulin increased progressively with advancing age, whereas ovarian levels of alpha 2-macroglobulin remained relatively stable with an increase in animal age. As serum alpha 2-macroglobulin is an acute-phase protein in the rat, the response of this protein in the testis to induced inflammation was examined. The concentration of alpha 2-macroglobulin in serum rose about 150-fold after injection of fermented yeast. By contrast, the levels of this protein in rete testis fluid, which is derived exclusively from seminiferous fluid, did not change in response to inflammation. These results suggest that there might be distinctive mechanisms that regulate this protein in the systemic circulation vs. the microenvironment behind the blood-testis barrier in the seminiferous epithelium.\r"

  ".U": "91243619\r", 
  ".W": "The isolation and hormonal regulation of two low molecular weight insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) present in the conditioned medium (CM) of the rat neuroblastoma cell line B104 cells has been performed. IGFBPs were purified by ZnSO4 precipitation, insulin-like growth factor-I 1IGF-I) affinity chromatography, and reverse phase HPLC. Final isolation and N-terminal analysis was accomplished by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and sequencing of the bound proteins. Two IGFBPs, with apparent Mr of 28K and 24K were coisolated and sequenced. Both proteins had identical N-terminal sequences and appear to be two forms of IGFBP-4. Treatment of the IGFBPs with endoglycosidase-F caused a shift in the apparent Mr of the 28K IGFBP to 24K. However, there was no change in the apparent Mr of the 24K IGFBP. The data from this study suggest that the IGFBP-4 exists as both a glycosylated and nonglycosylated protein. Treatment of B104 cells with IGF-I increased the expression of both the 24K and 28K IGFBPs and also resulted in the appearance of IGFBP-3 and an unknown IGFBP at 29K. When added to subconfluent cells, IGF-I was also mitogenic in B104 cells. Similar to IGF-I, IGF-II treatment increased cell number and resulted in the appearance of IGFBP-3 and the 29K IGFBP. However, IGF-II treatment resulted in a significant decrease (approximately 50%) in the 24K IGFBP and also decreased the 28K IGFBP. This decrease in the expression of the 24K and 28K IGFBPs was dose-dependent and was blocked by addition of IGF-I to the cells. When an IGF-II receptor antibody was added to the cells it mimicked the effects of IGF-II on B104 cells, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of IGF-II are mediated through the type II IGF receptor. Although both IGF-I and IGF-II affected the amount of the 24K IGFBP in the CM, neither peptide affected the expression of the messenger RNA for the 24K IGFBP. In conclusion, we have isolated two IGFBPs from the CM of B104 cells. Both the 24K and 28K IGFBPs appear to be isoforms of the same protein, and sequence data suggest these proteins are two forms of IGFBP-4. IGF-I increases the expression of both of these IGFBPs, whereas IGF-II decreases their expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Deglycosylated hCG is a derivative of hCG which retains the ability to bind to the LH/CG receptor, but is unable to activate adenylyl cyclase and thus stimulate cAMP production. A comparison of the fates of the receptor-bound hormones during a single round of endocytosis showed that deglycosylated hCG is internalized slower than hCG. It was also noted that the rate of degradation of the internalized deglycosylated hCG is slower than that of hCG. Two sets of experiments were performed which led to the conclusion that the slower internalization of deglycosylated hCG is not due to its inability to stimulate cAMP production. First, the rate of internalization of deglycosylated hCG in MA-10 cells is not increased in the presence of a cAMP analog. Second, there is little or no difference in the rate of internalization of hCG in a subclone of MA-10 cells [designated MA-10(K3)] that express a cAMP-resistant phenotype.\r"

  ".U": "91243622\r", 
  ".W": "The mouse kidney is a unique tissue since both vitamin D-dependent calcium binding proteins (calbindin-D9k and calbindin-D28k) are present in the same cells of the distal convoluted tubule. We have used specific complementary DNAs to mouse calbindin-D9k and mouse calbindin-D28k and Northern and slot blot analyses in order to obtain a better understanding of the regulation of two different molecular expressions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] action in the same cells. Both calbindins were found to be regulated developmentally in a similar manner (an increase in gene expression between birth and 1 week of age, coinciding with nephron differentiation, and a peak at 3 weeks of age). However, the time course of response of the messenger RNA of each calbindin to 1,25(OH)2D3 was markedly different. The peak of induction of renal calbindin-D28k mRNA was at 12 h after a single injection of 1,25(OH)2D3 (200 ng/100 g body wt) to vitamin D-deficient mice, and a decrease was observed at 24 h (similar to the time course of response of other steroid-regulated genes). Interestingly, unlike calbindin-D28k, a delayed response of renal calbindin-D9k mRNA to 1,25(OH)2D3 was observed (the peak of induction was at 24 h after 1,25(OH)2D3 administration). Both genes in mouse kidney did not respond to glucocorticoids, although a dose-dependent decrease (12-86%) of mouse intestinal calbindin-D9k mRNA was observed after dexamethasone treatment, suggesting tissue-specific multiple steroid interactions in the regulation of calbindin gene expression. The finding of a different time course of regulation of each calbindin by 1,25(OH)2D3 suggests that different factors may be regulating the expression of the two different calbindins in mouse kidney and that elucidation of these control mechanisms should provide new insight concerning 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis of synergistic effects between luminal stimulants and the intramural neural network in the control of intestinal neurotensin (NT) release was investigated with an isolated vascularly perfused rat jejuno-ileum. Luminal administration of low doses of taurocholic acid (TC; 1, 5, and 10 mM) provoked only a small increase in NT-like immunoreactivity (NT-LI) in the portal effluent (50%, 100%, and 130%, respectively, above basal). Increasing the concentration of TC to 20 mM induced a strong and sustained release of NT-LI (700% above basal). The arterial infusion of bombesin (BOM; 10(-9) M) induced only a transient rise in NT-LI levels (200% above basal), with a rapid return to basal values. In contrast, 10(-9) M BOM synergistically enhanced NT-LI responses induced by 10 mM TC; the integrated response of NT-LI release was 3.2-fold higher than the sum of responses to 10(-9) M BOM and 10 mM TC alone. These cooperative effects were apparent with 10(-10) M BOM and TC concentrations over the physiological range 1-10 mM. Neither tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M) nor atropine (10(-5) M) was able to modify this synergy. Substance-P and methacholine, two other NT secretagogues, did not potentiate the TC-induced NT responses. In conclusion, BOM potentiated the release of NT induced by TC, thus suggesting that bombesinergic neurons, among other stimulatory neurons of the enteric nervous system, may modulate the sensitivity of N-cells to luminal stimulants.\r"

  ".W": "A striking sexual dimorphism exists in the pattern of GH secretion and rate of somatic growth; however, the mechanism(s) mediating this sex difference is unknown. To elucidate the physiological roles of the hypothalamic neuropeptides, somatostatin (SRIF) and GRF, and their interrelation, in generating the sexually dimorphic GH secretory pattern we examined: 1) GH responsiveness to exogenous GRF and 2) the effects of immunoneutralization of endogenous SRIF and GRF on GH secretory dynamics, in free-moving male and female rats. In males, the GH response to 1 microgram rat(r)GRF(1-29)NH2 iv was significantly greater at peak compared to trough times of GH secretion (925.2 +/- 250.8 vs. 95.6 +/- 27.8 ng/ml; P less than 0.02), the latter known to be due to antagonization by the cyclic increased release of endogenous SRIF. In contrast, females failed to exhibit a time-dependent difference in GH responsiveness to GRF. Passive immunization with a specific antiserum to SRIF in males resulted in significant elevation of GH nadir levels but had no effect on GH peak amplitude. In contrast, immunoneutralization of endogenous SRIF in females caused a marked augmentation of plasma GH levels at all time points; there was a significant increase in GH peak amplitude (171.3 +/- 39.9 vs. 67.5 +/- 11.3 ng/ml; P less than 0.05), GH nadir (18.3 +/- 2.7 vs. 5.8 +/- 1.1 ng/ml; P less than 0.01) and mean 6-h plasma GH level (78.7 +/- 4.1 vs. 33.1 +/- 5.8 ng/ml; P less than 0.001), compared to normal sheep serum-treated controls. These results indicate that the pattern of hypothalamic SRIF secretion in females does not follow the male-like ultradian rhythm. Passive immunization with a specific antiserum to GRF obliterated spontaneous GH pulses in both sexes. Moreover, in females, anti-GRF serum attenuated GH nadir levels (4.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 21.4 +/- 3.5 ng/ml; P less than 0.01) indicating a physiological role for GRF in maintaining the elevated basal GH level of females, in addition to its important role in generating the episodic GH pulses. Taken together, these findings provide support for the hypothesis that, in female rats, the pattern of hypothalamic SRIF secretion into hypophyseal portal blood is continuous, rather than cyclical, as in the male; whereas in the case of GRF secretion, in addition to steady-state release which occurs at a higher level in females than males, there is also episodic GRF bursting which does not follow a specific rhythm, as in the male.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

All organs contained AR in their mesenchymal/stromal cells at all times examined. The Wolffian ducts and UGS did not contain epithelial AR on days 13-14 or 16 of gestation. The efferent ductule was the first site of epithelial AR expression in the male tract during development; this organ had epithelial AR on day 16 and at all subsequent times. The epididymis and ductus deferens contained epithelial AR beginning on day 19 of gestation. Seminal vesicle and coagulating gland epithelium was AR- at birth, became weakly AR+ on day 1, and was strongly AR+ on day 2 and subsequently. Prostatic epithelium was AR- up to day 4, when some positive epithelial cells were seen; the prostatic epithelium was strongly AR+ on day 6 and subsequently. The last organ to begin expressing epithelial AR was the bulbouretheral gland; this epithelium did not become clearly AR+ until day 8 postnatally. In summary, these results indicate that initial epithelial AR expression in the male reproductive tract occurs in a clear temporal sequence and proceeds in a cranial-caudal direction. Epithelial AR first appear in the efferent ductules, followed by initial epithelial AR expression in Wolffian-derived organs and finally in the UGS-derived organs. The factors controlling initial epithelial AR expression are unclear, but mesenchyme may be involved.\r"

In earlier studies elevated concentrations GLP-I(7-37) inhibited insulin release and cAMP generation in beta-cells. We now show that the GLP-I(7-37) receptor in the glucose-responsive B-cell line HIT-T15 undergoes rapid and reversible homologous desensitization in response to supraphysiological concentrations of GLP-I(7-37). GLP-I(7-37) stimulated insulin release and cAMP generation in a glucose-dependent biphasic manner with a maximum stimulation at 10 nmol/liter. The first-phase insulin secretory response was reduced by 41% at doses of GLP-I(7-37) of 100 nmol/liter and higher. Preperifusion of B-cells with 100 nmol/liter GLP-I(7-37) for 5 or 10 min reduced a subsequent insulin secretory response to 10 nmol/liter GLP-I(7-37) after hormone washout and recovery periods of 10 min (52% and 55% reduction) or 30 min (33% reduction or full recovery). Preperifusion of HIT-T15 cells with 100 nmol/liter glucagon (10 min) or 100 nmol/liter gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) (10 min) had no effect on the insulin secretory response to 10 nmol/liter GLP-(7-37). Prior exposure of cells to 100 nmol/liter GLP-(7-37) (10 min) did not alter the GIP-induced (10 nmol/liter) insulin release, but 100 nmol/liter GIP (10 min) reduced the insulin secretion during stimulation with 10 nmol/liter GIP by 56%. These data indicate that: 1) the GLP-I(7-37) receptor is subject to rapid and reversible homologous desensitization and, 2) the GLP-I(7-37) receptor on beta-cells is distinct from that of GIP. The recent finding of elevated GLP-I(7-36)amide levels in subjects with noninsulin-dependent diabetes suggest the possibility that a homologous desensitization of the GLP-I(7-37) receptor might contribute to the impaired insulin secretion in this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) affects both bone resorption and formation, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. PGE2 is known to elevate intracellular cAMP levels in a variety of culture systems. Agents that increase cAMP in primary osteoblast-enriched (Ob) cultures enhance the synthesis of skeletal insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a potent anabolic factor for bone. A 5 min exposure to PGE2 at 0.01-1 microM enhanced cAMP synthesis in Ob cultures by 8- to 54-fold, and within 6 h produced up to a 3- fold increase in steady state prepro-IGF-I transcripts. The stimulatory effect of PGE2 on IGF-I messenger RNA was first evident within 4 h of treatment and remained elevated for at least 24 h. Furthermore, 0.01-1 microM PGE2 increased immunoreactive IGF-I polypeptide accumulation by 1.9- to 4.7-fold. In contrast PGE2 did not elevate steady state IGF-II mRNA or polypeptide levels within this time frame. Although PTH increase cAMP, intracellular calcium, and PGE2 production by bone cells, our previous studies indicate that the stimulatory effect of PTH on IGF-I production is cAMP, but not calcium dependent. Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis by exposure to indomethacin did not alter basal or PTH-stimulated IGF-I levels, substantiating that the effect of PTH on IGF-I is not PGE2 dependent. These studies indicate that PGE2 production, a feature common to many agents that enhance bone resorption, could contribute to the coupling of bone resorption and new bone formation, by way of its ability to increase cAMP and, consequently, IGF-I synthesis by the osteoblast.\r"

The sequence of residues 13-22 was recognized by three MAbs. The C-terminal region from residues 84-92 was recognized by three MAbs. All MAbs recognized conformational epitopes in that they reacted with two or more regions. Three MAbs (two against free alpha and one against human CG) have linear amino acid sequences as part of their conformational epitope.\r"

In this study we tested the hypothesis that these maturational events are induced by endogenous cAMP. During culture of human fetal lung the content of tissue cAMP increased 140% from days 3-6. Treatment with isobutylmethylxanthine caused a further doubling of cAMP content, and indomethacin blocked most of the increase in cAMP. Isobutylmethylxanthine accelerated and indomethacin inhibited the increases during culture in surfactant protein-A (SP-A), SP-A mRNA, SP-B mRNA, phosphatidylcholine content, and activity of fatty acid synthetase. There was no effect of these treatments on the content of SP-C mRNA, which did not increase during culture. Increasing concentrations of prostaglandins E1 and E2 in the presence of indomethacin produced a parallel stimulation of cAMP content, SP-A, and fatty acid synthetase activity. The temporal increase in SP-A was also blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase-A. In morphological studies, indomethacin-treated explants appeared less mature, with decreased intralumenal volume and more columnar epithelial cells. We conclude that increased tissue cAMP levels, stimulated by endogenous prostaglandins, accelerate differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells during explant culture.\r"

  ".W": "The lectin Concanavalin-A (Con-A) binds to cell surface carbohydrate-containing moieties and modulates the function of a variety of glycoprotein receptors. Since extracellular calcium (Ca2+) may regulate parathyroid function by a receptor-like process, we examined the effects of Con-A on various aspects of Ca(2+)-regulated parathyroid function. We recently showed that Con-A significantly reduces the inhibitory effects of high Ca2+ on dopamine as well as isoproterenol- and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. In our present studies Con-A similarly reduced the inhibitory effect of 2.0 mM Ca2+ on PTH release from 60 +/- 6% to 40 +/- 6% and increased the set-point for Ca(2+)-regulated PTH release from 1.25 to 1.8 mM. This effect was dose dependent. Con-A also inhibited the Ca(2+)-stimulated accumulation of inositol phosphates by 50-60% in association with a marked reduction in the high Mg(2+)-evoked spike in cytosolic Ca2+ as well as a significant decrease in the sustained rise in cytosolic Ca2+ at 2-3 mM extracellular Ca2+. These data provide further evidence for a key role for cell surface carbohydrate-containing moieties in the mechanism through which parathyroid cells \"sense\" Ca2+ and, in turn, regulate PTH release, phosphoinositide turnover, and the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores. It is possible that the putative Ca2+ receptor is a glycoprotein or is closely associated with glycoproteins or other moieties containing alpha-methyl-D-glucoside or alpha-methyl-D-mannoside residues.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of insulin and glucose, alone and combined, on diacylglycerol (DAG), protein kinase-C (PKC), and glucose transport were compared in rat adipocytes and solei incubated in medium containing 0-20 mM glucose. In both tissues insulin rapidly stimulated [3H]DAG production from [3H]glycerol; extracellular glucose masked this effect in adipocytes, but not in solei. [3H]Glucose was avidly converted to DAG in adipocytes, and this conversion was enhanced by insulin. In contrast, [3H]glucose was poorly converted to DAG in solei. Glucose alone (5-20 mM) stimulated PKC translocation in adipocytes, but not in solei. Insulin stimulated PKC translocation in both tissues at all glucose concentrations. However, glucose modulated this effect of insulin in adipocytes by 1) decreasing cytosolic PKC and the absolute amount of PKC translocated, and 2) promoting apparent turnover of membrane PKC. In contrast, in solei, glucose did not affect PKC levels or translocation responses to insulin. In keeping with DAG-PKC signalling, the relative glucose transport effects of insulin were influenced by extracellular glucose in adipocytes, but not in solei. These results suggest that 1) glucose-induced PKC translocation requires metabolism of glucose to DAG; 2) glucose activates DAG-PKC signalling in adipocytes, but not in solei; 3) insulin activates DAG-PKC signalling in both tissues at all glucose levels; and 4) glucose may modulate the effects of insulin on DAG-PKC signalling in adipocytes, but not in solei. Consistent with in vitro results, in solei taken directly from diabetic rats, membrane PKC was decreased, and cytosolic PKC was increased, presumably reflecting diminished PKC translocation due to hypoinsulinemia. In contrast, in adipose tissue, cytosolic PKC was decreased, presumably reflecting hyperglycemia-induced PKC translocation. Accordingly, DAG levels were increased in adipose tissue, but not in solei, in diabetic rats, and insulin increased DAG in both tissues.\r"

Insulin preactivation of the kinases resulted in increased phosphorylation of a single 175,000 mol wt PYP (p175) beside insulin and IGF-I receptors. Phosphorylation of both p175 and receptors exhibited almost identical time courses and insulin dose responses, suggesting that p175 may serve as a substrate for the insulin and IGF-I receptor kinases. Preincubation of autophosphorylated receptors with PYPs derived from insulin-stimulated cells decreased 32P-labeled receptor precipitation by antiphosphotyrosine-Sepharose by 50-70% compared to that obtained upon preincubation with PYPs from unstimulated cells. This effect was not the result of PYP-receptor competition, was observed on both in vivo and in vitro phosphorylated receptors, and was almost completely blocked by 100 microM sodium vanadate, suggesting PYP copurification of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase. No phosphatase was recovered in lysates from insulin-unstimulated cells. Maximum activity was detected after 2 min of insulin stimulation, decreasing by more than 50% after 30 min. Antiphosphotyrosine recovery of p175 from cell lysates exhibited almost identical insulin dependency. Complete recovery of both p175 and phosphatase activity was obtained after receptor immunodepletion of the extracts. Thus, a receptor phosphatase activity from insulin-stimulated FRTL5 cells is retained on an antiphosphotyrosine affinity matrix and correlates with phosphorylation of the p175 substrate for the insulin and IGF-I receptor kinases.\r"

  ".W": "In luteal and granulosa cells, hydrogen peroxide abruptly inhibits activation of adenylate cyclase by receptor-bound gonadotropin and blocks steroidogenesis. In the present studies a post-cAMP site of peroxide action on inhibition of steroidogenesis was investigated. Steroidogenesis, stimulated by dibutyryl or 8-bromo-cAMP, was inhibited by hydrogen peroxide. Yet, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation in cytosol or intact cells was unaffected by peroxide treatment. Hydrogen peroxide also did not inhibit the activity of cholesterol esterase and acyl coenzyme-A:acyltransferase. Progesterone synthesis was maximally increased 5- to 50-fold with 25- and 22-hydroxycholesterol, respectively. Unlike that seen with cAMP analogs and LH, however, progestin synthesis stimulated by these cell- and mitochondria-permeant cholesterol analogs was not inhibited by hydrogen peroxide. Treatment of animals with amino-glutethimide produces a marked accumulation of steroidogenic cholesterol substrate and a large increase in hormone-independent steroidogenesis in subsequently isolated and washed luteal tissue. In this paradigm, hydrogen peroxide did not inhibit elevated basal progesterone synthesis in luteal cells produced by in vivo aminoglutethimide treatment, yet LH-stimulated steroidogenesis was blocked. However, treatment of luteal cells with hydrogen peroxide inhibited pregnenolone synthesis in isolated mitochondria, an effect partially reversed by the addition of luteal cell cytosol. In summary, while peroxide inhibited cAMP-dependent steroidogenesis, it did not appear to inhibit protein kinase activation or mobilization of cholesterol from intracellular esterified stores. Although peroxide inhibited pregnenolone synthesis, it had no effect on steroidogenesis when substrate was made available by either addition of cholesterol analogs or prior treatment with aminoglutethimide in vivo. We conclude, therefore, that hydrogen peroxide inhibits steroidogenesis by blocking intracellular transport of cholesterol to mitochondria or translocation of cholesterol across the outer mitochondrial membrane.\r"

Hybridizations were performed in Northern blots obtained from electrophoreses of poly (A+) enriched RNA preparations from mammary glands and livers of rats on days 0, 6, 12, 19, and 21 of pregnancy and 5, 10, 15, and 20 of lactation. The Northern blots were also hybridized with a chicken beta-actin probe, to correct for the amount of mRNA added and the different metabolic states of the tissues. Both tissues expressed the same forms of PRL receptor mRNAs, namely bands at 2.5, 3, and 5.5 kilobases encoding the long form of the receptor and a major band at 1.8 kilobases encoding the short form. The liver expressed all the receptor mRNA forms in much higher quantity than the mammary gland, independent of the reproductive state. In liver there was an increase of all the transcripts on day 19 of pregnancy, followed by an abrupt decline at the onset of lactation, to levels lower than those of virgin rats. In contrast, mammary gland PRL receptor mRNAs were low in virgin and pregnant animals, increased significantly at day 21 of pregnancy, and continued to increase throughout lactation. Treatment of day 19 pregnant rats with the antiprogesterone RU 486 induced, 24 h later, PRL receptor mRNAs in mammary gland but not in liver. There were no significant differences in the relative proportions of long to short forms of PRL receptor mRNAs at the different reproductive states, but the proportion of the long form was slightly greater in mammary gland than in liver. Membrane PRL receptor concentrations were also measured in the same tissues used for the mRNA study by binding to a 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody (U5), which specifically recognizes the PRL receptor at a site different from the hormone binding site. The quantity of receptor measured by U5 binding was approximately 3 times higher than that measured with 125I-labeled ovine PRL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the ovine fetus, adrenalectomy at 90-120 days gestational age (dGA) results in a gradual increase in basal concentrations of fetal plasma ACTH beginning at approximately 122 dGA. Bilateral adrenalectomy at 116-119 dGA also results in an increase in POMC mRNA in the fetal pituitary. It is not known whether both the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary of the ovine fetus are responsive in late gestation to the removal of cortisol negative feedback. The purpose of this study was to determine the subsequent effect of fetal adrenalectomy at 118-121 dGA on the CRH mRNA content in fetal PVN and on POMC mRNA in the fetal anterior pituitary at 134 dGA. Mature Rambouellet-Columbia cross-bred ewes (n = 10), bred on a single occasion only and carrying fetuses of known gestational ages, were used. Both fetal adrenal glands were exposed via a retroperitoneal approach and removed [adrenalectomized (ADX); n = 5]. In control fetuses (CONT; n = 5) adrenal glands were exposed and isolated, but not removed. At 134 dGA, fetal plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly greater in CONT fetuses (7.2 +/- 2.5 ng/ml) than in ADX fetuses (mean +/- SD, 1.97 +/- 0.9 ng/ml; P less than 0.025). At 134 dGA the fetal PVN was removed by micropunching, and the anterior pituitary was separated from neurointermediate and posterior lobes after necropsy. Total RNA was prepared by the guanidium isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method and subjected to Northern analysis using specific cDNA probes to CRH and POMC. After autoradiography, quantification of mRNA was performed by scanning densitometry. Quantities of specific hybridization signal for POMC and CRH were normalized to the content of actin mRNA in each individual sample. RNA prepared from PVN exhibited a single specifically hybridizing band for CRH of approximately 1300 nucleotides. RNA prepared from anterior pituitary exhibited a single specifically hybridizing band for POMC at approximately 1300 nucleotides. Anterior pituitary POMC mRNA was significantly increased (P less than 0.025) in ADX fetuses (236 +/- 32% of CONT). CRH mRNA in PVN was greater in ADX fetuses than in CONT fetuses (P less than 0.05; mean +/- SEM, 179 +/- 21% of CONT). Adrenalectomy in fetal sheep significantly increased expression of CRH and POMC. We conclude that the increased levels of mRNA for CRH and POMC indicate that both the fetal PVN (CRH) and the anterior pituitary (POMC) are responsive to removal of the primary source of circulating glucocorticoid at this gestational age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These alterations preceded detection of a significant fall in plasma progesterone concentration. The rise in superoxide radical was not accompanied by changes in activities of free radical scavenging enzymes. Within the first hour of prostaglandin treatment, there was also a significant increase in the activity of phospholipase A2 and ATP-dependent calcium uptake in the membrane samples. These experiments indicate that one of the initial sites affected by the luteolytic process appears to be the plasma membrane. The changes include a transient rise in production of superoxide radicals, which may cause membrane changes that are responsible for disrupting corpus luteum function in the rat.\r"

Phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phorbol 12,13-didecanoate) stimulated PLP secretion at 10(-7)-10(-5) M, whereas forskolin treatment had no effect. When cells were treated initially with phorbol esters, ionomycin-stimulated PLP secretion was potentiated. The kinetics of this effect were rapid (t1/2, less than 1 min), and pretreatment with cycloheximide or actinomycin-D before phorbol ester and ionomycin treatment did not alter PLP secretion. Pretreatment for 24 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to desensitize the cells or use of inactive phorbol ester isomer 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate did not potentiate the ionomycin-stimulated PLP secretion.

Recent data suggest that the kidney, in addition to being a primary target for PTH, also recognizes changes in the concentration of extracellular Ca++, thereby modulating hormone-dependent cAMP production, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis, and renin secretion. In this study, we examined: 1) the effects of varying concentration of divalent cations on PTH-dependent cAMP production in renal proximal tubular cells; and 2) the mechanisms by which extracellular Ca++ exerts its inhibitory effects on cAMP production. Single cell suspensions composed of 80-90% proximal tubular cells were prepared from cortical homogenates by collagenase digestion and sieving. In the presence of 1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, cAMP content was measured by RIA in 5-15 min incubations and showed a 5- to 6-fold increase in response to PTH (10(-11) -10(-6) M). Increasing extracellular Ca++ and magnesium (Mg++) from 0 and 0.5 mM, respectively, to 5.0 mM inhibited PTH-dependent (3 x 10(-9) M) cAMP production by 54 +/- 4% and 47 +/- 6%, respectively. The half maximal inhibitory concentration for both Ca++ and Mg++ was 0.9 mM. In addition, increasing extracellular barium (Ba++) or strontium (Sr++) from 0-10 mM inhibited PTH-dependent (3 x 10(-9) M) production by 54 +/- 7% and 62 +/- 6% with half of the maximal observed inhibition at 2.2 and 2.7 mM, respectively. The inhibition of PTH-dependent cAMP production by 2.5 mM Ca++ was not reversed by the calcium channel blockers diltiazem or verapamil (10(-4) M). However, changes in intracellular calcium may play some role in the inhibitory effects of Ca++ on cAMP production, since ionomycin (10(-6)-10(-5) M) lowered PTH-dependent cAMP production by 25-36%. Our data suggest that the proximal tubular cell can sense physiologically relevant changes in Ca++, providing a potential mechanism for the modulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production or other tubular functions relevant to fluid and mineral homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, electrical stimulation of several nuclei in the dorsal rostral pons of the cat was shown to modulate the release of ACTH. However, the stimulation may have activated fibers of passage. To determine if there are specific groups of neurons within the pons that modulate plasma ACTH when stimulated with glutamate, 30 cats were prepared acutely under chloralose anesthesia. Microinjections of several agents were made at each of 2 sites in the pons of each cat. ACTH was measured by RIA. Injections of 150 mM L-glutamate (100 nl/min.2 min) elicited increases in arterial pressure that were related to the loci of injection. The responses did not decrease significantly when the rate and volume of the injection were reduced by half. Eight sites in a lateral area that extended rostrally from the parabracheal nucleus elicited a significant pressor response that was greater in duration and magnitude than a second significant pressor response that was obtained from 18 sites in a medial area that included the rostral locus coeruleus. Pressor responses did not occur when 0.1 mM norepinephrine or vehicle was substituted for L-glutamate in any area. The larger, but not the smaller, dose of L-glutamate elicited changes in plasma ACTH that were related to the loci of injection. Eight sites in a caudal area that included the ventral locus coeruleus and was within the medial pressor area elicited a significant increase in ACTH. Seven sites in an area rostral to the ventral locus coeruleus that included the rostromedial locus subcoeruleus elicited a significant decrease in plasma ACTH. ACTH responses were not observed when 0.1 mM norepinephrine or vehicle was substituted for L-glutamate in any area. In conclusion, the ventral locus coeruleus and the rostrally adjacent locus subcoeruleus contain neurons with receptors for L-glutamate that can modulate plasma ACTH and arterial pressure independently of a second pathway that includes the parabracheal region and influences arterial pressure. Because the neurons in the coeruleus are known to respond to hemodynamic input, they may participate in the hemodynamic control of ACTH release.\r"

  ".W": "PTH activates multiple second messengers in its target cells, but the level at which the hormonal signal splits into different pathways is still unknown. To achieve insights on this issue, we have studied the structure-function relationship of PTH by analyzing the effects of bovine PTH-(1-34) [bPTH-(1-34)] and PTH fragments truncated at the N-terminus on the intracellular calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) and cAMP production in the rat osteogenic sarcoma cell line UMR 106-01. [Ca2+]i was measured in single cells using fura-2. When exposed to 10(-7) M bPTH-(1-34), 20% of the cells responded with a transient increase in [Ca2+]i of variable amplitude. Equimolar doses of bPTH-(2-34), propionyl bPTH-(2-34) [(pbPTH-(2-34)], and bPTH-(3-34) also transiently increased [Ca2+]i, whereas both [tyrosine34]bPTH-(7-34) amide [bPTH-(7-34)] and bPTH-(30-34) were ineffective. The amplitude of the [Ca2+] i transients was dose-dependent, with threshold concentrations of 10(-10) M for bPTH-(1-34) and bPTH-(2-34), and 10(-9) M for bPTH-(3-34). The response rate to the active peptides ranged between 10-30%, without a clear dose-relatedness. A second addition of 10(-7) M bPTH-(1-34) to cells prestimulated with equimolar doses of bPTH-(2-34), pbPTH-(2-34), or bPTH-(3-34) produced another transient, whereas after exposure to 10(-7) M bPTH-(1-34), the cells were completely desensitized to a second homologous stimulation, suggesting that the binding affinity of the truncated peptides for the PTH receptor is lower than that of the intact bPTH-(1-34) fragment. In addition, both bPTH-(1-34) and bPTH-(2-34) dose-dependently stimulated cAMP production, but the former was more potent (ED50 = 10(-9) vs. 10(-7) M, respectively). On the contrary, pbPTH-(2-34), bPTH-(3-34), and bPTH-(7-34) had no effect on cAMP. Pretreating the cells with pertussis toxin to enhance cAMP responses via inhibition of Gi potentiated the effect of bPTH-(1-34) and bPTH-(2-34) and disclosed weak but detectable agonist action of pbPTH-(2-34). These results indicate that specific domains of the PTH molecule are linked to activation of different second messenger pathways; while the first two amino acids are indispensable for activating the cAMP system, generation of the [Ca2+]i signal appears to involve a longer domain, including the amino acid residue in position 3.\r"

These studies examined the mechanism of CPH-induced insulin depletion by determining the time course for CPH-induced changes in pancreatic preproinsulin mRNA, proinsulin, and insulin levels. A single oral dose of CPH decreased proinsulin levels to 35% of the control value by 3 h. Proinsulin stayed depressed for up to 24 h. Preproinsulin mRNA declined more slowly, reaching 35% of the control value at 6 h, and increased more rapidly, returning to the control value by 24 h. Pancreatic insulin levels did not decrease significantly until 24 h. Exposure of isolated rat islets to CPH for 30 min in vitro selectively inhibited proinsulin synthesis by 62%, without affecting preproinsulin mRNA levels. The dissociation between changes in proinsulin and preproinsulin mRNA levels suggests that the decrease in preproinsulin mRNA in vivo is associated with but does not cause CPH-induced changes in insulin biosynthesis.\r"

Neomycin caused a reversible, dose-dependent inhibition of low calcium (Ca++)-stimulated PTH release, with half-maximal inhibition at 30 microM. Maximal inhibition (with 200 microM neomycin) was not additive with the suppressive effects of high (2 mM) Ca++. Neomycin also inhibited dopamine-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 90-98% at 100-200 microM, with a half-maximal effect at 40-50 microM. This action was reversible and was blocked by preincubating the cells overnight with 0.5 microgram/ml pertussis toxin. In addition to its suppressive effects on cAMP metabolism and PTH release, neomycin stimulated the accumulation of inositol phosphates and produced a transient increase in the cytosolic Ca++ concentration (Cai) in fura-2-loaded parathyroid cells. The neomycin-evoked spike in Cai persisted despite removal of extracellular Ca++, indicating that it arises from intracellular Ca++ stores. Exposure of cells to elevated magnesium (Mg++) concentrations elicited a similar spike in Cai but blocked the spike in Cai in response to subsequent addition of neomycin and vice versa. Thus, Mg++ and neomycin mobilize Ca++ from the same intracellular store(s). These results indicate that a polycation, neomycin, closely mimics the effects of polyvalent cations on parathyroid function, suggesting that both agents regulate parathyroid function via similar biochemical pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Two bioactive products of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) prohormone have been isolated from ovine hypothalamus: PACAP38 with 38 residues and PACAP27 corresponding to the N-terminal 27 residues of PACAP38. Immunocytochemical and RIA results support the existence of PACAP in the rat brain, posterior pituitary, and various peripheral tissues. Furthermore, high affinity PACAP-binding sites have been detected in the rat brain, anterior pituitary, and cultured astrocytes which differ from those in lung, liver, and cultured mouse splenocytes. In the present study additional rat tissues were examined to elucidate the location and characteristics of PACAP-binding sites using [125I] PACAP27 with conventional methods of receptor autoradiography and RRA. Binding specificity was established by displacement with unlabeled PACAP27 or a related peptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). PACAP27-binding sites were localized autoradiographically in the testis, epididymis, adrenal gland, lung, liver, prostate gland, and seminal vesicle; binding sites were not detected in the heart, kidney, or thymus. In the testis and epididymis, a PACAP27-binding site was localized on germinal cells and in the adrenal gland on medullary chromaffin cells. Excess VIP did not displace PACAP27 binding localized in these three tissues. A site with a greater affinity for PACAP27 than for VIP was detected in adrenal gland and epididymis, characteristic of a site recognized previously in hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, and cultured astrocytes. The PACAP-specific site was more abundant in these tissues than a second site to which PACAP27 and VIP bound with similar affinities. Accordingly, the first site has been named type I. In lung, liver, prostate, and seminal vesicle, VIP displaced PACAP27 binding localized autoradiographically. Lung and liver contained an abundant site to which PACAP27 and VIP bound with similar affinities. This binding site, measured previously in lung, liver, and cultured splenocytes, may be shared by PACAP and VIP and has been named type II. Taken together, these data support the existence of two high affinity binding sites for PACAP with different tissue distribution.\r"

During the purification of one member of the placental PRL family, PRL-like protein-A (PLP-A), we identified a major contaminating protein with a similar mol wt but possessing a more acidic pI (5.9-6.1) and different immunoreactivities. After isolation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the more acidic contaminating protein was electroeluted, and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by gas phase sequencing. The N-terminal sequence showed considerable homology with members of the PRL family, including characteristic positioning of cysteine residues at amino acids 4 and 11. The newly identified protein species have been termed PLP-C based on their structural similarity with pituitary PRL. The protein was further characterized by the generation of specific immunological probes. Antibodies were generated to electrophoretically purified protein and to a chemically synthesized peptide representing amino acids 11-32 of its N-terminal sequence. Each antiserum specifically recognized two major species migrating at approximately 25 and 29 kDa, respectively. The 29-kDa species specifically bound to Concanavalin-A, while the 25-kDa species failed to bind to the lectin. Furthermore, the 29-kDa species could be converted to the 25-kDa species by enzymatic deglycosylation. The antisera have also been used to examine the cell- and temporal-specific patterns of expression. The immunoreactive protein species (25 and 29 kDa) were localized primarily to spongiotrophoblast cells present in the junctional zone of the chorioallantoic placenta. Expression was initiated after midgestation and increased during the remaining part of gestation. In summary, PLP-C is a major secretory protein produced by spongiotrophoblast cells during the second half of gestation.\r"

Also, the insulin release and flow distribution within the perfused rat pancreas were studied in response to these agents. Arginine, Meth-arg, and Nit-arg stimulated insulin release in cultured islets, but had no effect on glucose oxidation. Arginine and Meth-arg, an inhibitor of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase I (NS-I) stimulated insulin release from the perfused pancreas. Nit-arg, however, which inhibits nitric oxide synthase II (NS-II) had no such effect. Neither arginine nor Nit-arg or Met-arg changed the distribution of microspheres within the perfused pancreas. We conclude that interference with NS type I or II has no effect on insulin release from cultured islets, but inhibition of NS-II abolishes the insulin response in the perfused pancreas, which may be mediated by factors released from endothelial cells. These effects are not due to any changes in the flow distribution within the pancreas. The lack of inhibitory effect by Nit-arg in cultured islets may reflect the absence of endothelial or nervous cells in the cultured islets.\r"

Oviducts were collected from cyclic ewes on days 1, 8, and 16 and ovariectomized (OVX) ewes after treatment with corn oil (CO), E, P, and E + P. Tissue was incubated in the presence of 3H-leucine or 3H-glucosamine. Rates of 3H-leucine incorporation into nondialyzable macromolecules by explants was greater (P less than 0.05) on day 1 than days 8 and 16, greater (P = 0.01) in OVX E-treated ewes, greater in A than I regardless of treatment and greater (P less than 0.05) in A than I with E. Culture medium was analyzed by one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Two major basic proteins (Mr 90-92,000) and three minor proteins were only present on day 1 of estrus. E treatment demonstrated these same proteins which were not found with CO or P treatment. Two-dimensional analysis of medium from A and I cultured separately indicated that A synthesized the two major basic and three minor E-dependent proteins. Of three protein complexes present regardless of treatment or cycle day, two were dominant in the A and one was dominant in the I suggesting a synthetic gradient. Tunicamycin did not inhibit incorporation of 3H-glucosamine into E-dependent proteins. Gel filtration revealed a high Mr fraction (2 x 10(6] 2.5-fold greater on day 1 than day 8 and 2.2-fold greater with E than CO treatment. This study clearly demonstrates: 1) that the oviduct from estrus and E-treated ewes synthesizes two major basic and three minor glycoproteins not detectable on other cycle days or with OVX or P treatment; 2) the E-dependent glycoproteins are synthesized by the A; and 3) a high Mr fraction is induced or amplified by E.\r"

We have found that this protein prevents the application of immunoassays using monoclonal antibodies to study possible production of a CG-like material by this bacteria. Employing an immunoglobulin saturation technique to block this protein as well as a zwitterion detergent membrane solubilization technique, we now report the isolation of a membrane protein from Pseudomonas maltophilia which shows immunological relationships to the beta-subunit and carboxyl tail of human pregnancy CG. This pseudomonas immunoreactive material produced dose-response curves in the following CG immunoassays: 1) a polyclonal rabbit anti-CG equilibrium assay, 2) carboxyl tail CG equilibrium assay, and 3) two CG equilibrium assays using monoclonal antibodies. The pseudomonas CG-like protein did not react in equilibrium assays for human TSH, human LH, or free alpha-subunit of CG. The pseudomonas CG-like protein was purified by affinity chromatography. The purified protein showed only 0.25% cross-reaction with pregnancy CG in the monoclonal antibody equilibrium assays. Furthermore, the purified protein showed no binding to rat testicular CG/LH receptors, but showed avid binding to the pseudomonas CG-binding protein previously described by Richert and Ryan. The pseudomonas protein showed no binding to Concanavalin-A, which avidly binds pregnancy CG. When assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, this protein had a mol wt of 48,500 daltons, which is larger than the mol wt of the unglycosylated beta-subunit of pregnancy CG. We conclude that pseudomonas contain a protein that has partial homology to the beta-subunit of pregnancy CG. This material does not bind to mammalian CG receptors, but does bind to a pseudomonas CG-binding site. The latter suggests it has a function, as yet unknown, in pseudomonas.\r"

The activity was almost completely inhibited by 10(-3)-10(-5) M propylthiouracil and had the higher affinity for reverse T3 than T4. These findings indicate that type I iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase(I-5'-D) exists in cultured neonatal rat myocardial cells. Then, we studied the direct effects of T3, insulin, glucocorticoid, and angiotensin II (AII) on myocardial I-5'-D. The addition of 10(-9)-10(-7) M T3 or 10(-9)-10(-6) M AII to the culture medium increased I-5'-D activity in a dose-dependent manner. Insulin and dexamethasone, however, had no significant effects. Kinetic studies revealed that maximum velocities in T3- and AII-treated cells were 2.1- and 1.8-fold above the control value, respectively, whereas the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant did not alter significantly both in T3- and AII-treated cells. Moreover, the treatment of cyclohexamide combined with T3 or AII completely abolished the stimulating effect of these agents on I-5'-D activity. From these data, it is suggested that both T3 and AII increase the activity of myocardial I-5'-D by their direct actions to the heart, probably through the new synthesis of I-5'-D.\r"

The increase reflects a transcriptional action of the antithyroid agent and is inhibited by cycloheximide, as is the transcriptional action of TSH. It takes several hours to be apparent, is maximal between 24-48 h, and is specific, in that thyroid peroxidase and beta-actin mRNA levels are not increased simultaneously. The increased mRNA levels are associated with increased recovery of immunoprecipitable Tg in the medium of cells exposed to [35S]methionine. The MMI effect appears to be independent of the action of TSH or its cAMP signal, since the MMI-induced increase in Tg mRNA levels is evident in cells treated with TSH or maintained in its absence and is associated not with increases in cAMP levels but, rather, under some circumstances with a decrease. The effect is evident under conditions in which the ability of insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I to increase Tg mRNA levels is already maximal. The MMI-induced increase is inhibited by concentrations of iodide associated with autoregulation of FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, is inhibited but not mimicked by propylthiouracil, and is not altered by T3. The increase in Tg mRNA levels does not correlate with increased DNA synthesis as a function of MMI concentration either in cells treated with TSH or in those maintained in its absence. A concentration of MMI (5 mM) that increases Tg mRNA levels can also inhibit 8-bromo-cAMP- or phorbol ester-induced increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibin (alpha/beta) and activin (beta/beta) were first recognized as gonadal hormones that regulate the production and release of FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Studies now show that these proteins, which are members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) superfamily, and their corresponding messenger RNAs have a broad anatomical distribution and may regulate the growth and differentiation of a variety of cell types. To determine whether inhibin and activin may also play a role in embryonic development, in situ hybridization techniques were utilized to examine the localization of the mRNAs encoding the inhibin/activin subunits (alpha, beta A, beta B) in rat embryos from 12 days post coitum (p.c.) until birth. The beta A-subunit message was localized in the heart at 12 days p.c. and in the dermal layer of the skin starting at 13 days p.c. At 14 days p.c. this mRNA was first observed in the whisker follicles, in the developing skeleton of the snout, limbs, and in the intervertebral disks. At 16 days p.c. the beta A-message was found in the striatum of the brain, and at 18 days p.c. it was also detected in the cerebral cortex. The beta A-mRNA signal appeared in hair bulbs at 17 days p.c., in teeth at 18 days p.c., and in tendons and gonads just before birth. Expression of beta A-mRNA was no longer detected in the skin or intervertebral disks after 17 days p.c. The beta B-subunit message was found in the area of rapidly dividing cells surrounding the forebrain ventricle, starting at 14 days p.c., in the gonads from the time of gonadal sexual differentiation, at 14 days p.c., and in the salivary gland as early as 17 days p.c. The beta B-message continued to be expressed in these areas throughout embryogenesis. The inhibin-alpha subunit message was also detectable in the gonads from 14 days p.c. until birth. These data suggest that 1) inhibin and activin may be produced in the gonads and possibly play a hormonal role in the embryonic rat during the last trimester of pregnancy, and 2) activin may regulate aspects of the embryonic development of the heart, skin, hair and whiskers, cartilage, bone, tendons, teeth, salivary gland, brain, and gonads, possibly in coordination with other members of the TGF beta superfamily whose mRNAs are expressed in some of these same tissues during development.\r"

However, in rats with a pharmacological block of the endogenous CRF release, exogenous CRH (0.3 micrograms/kg iv), administered 15 min after a first similar dose, was unable to stimulate pituitary-adrenocortical activity above the level attained with the first peptide injection. On the contrary, in the same conditions exogenous arginine vasopressin (AVP) (0.3 micrograms/kg iv) administered 15 min after CRH, was able to further stimulate pituitary-adrenocortical activity. Using the same experimental procedure, oxytocin (0.3 micrograms/kg iv) was found to be totally inactive. The physiological import of these findings was investigated in the Brattleboro rat, genetically lacking in endogenous AVP, in which, unlike the control Long-Evans strain, the 2-fold stress exposure did not cause an increase in plasma corticosterone concentration greater than that of a single exposure. These results suggest that endogenous AVP is essential in sustaining adrenocortical activation in circumstances in which pituitary refractoriness towards CRH stimulation intervenes.\r"

  ".W": "To establish whether secretion of proglucagon-derived peptides (PGDPs) by the intestinal L cell is nutrient- and/or location-dependent, 0.9% saline, 200 mM glucose, or emulsified fats were administered into the ileal or duodenal lumen of normal rats. Fat administration, but not saline or glucose treatment, significantly increased circulating levels of the intestinal PGDPs in a time-dependent fashion, indicating a selectivity of the L cell in its response to nutrients. Interestingly, the response to duodenal fats was quantitatively and qualitatively identical to the response to ileal fats, despite 50-fold lower concentrations of PGDPs in the duodenum. These results suggest the existence of a duodenal factor that stimulates ileal PGDP secretion in response to fat ingestion. Ileal and plasma levels of gut PGDPs have been reported to be elevated in poorly controlled streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Whether the sensitivity of the L cell to luminal nutrients is altered in diabetes was, therefore, also examined. The L cell responses to luminal nutrients in diabetic rats were not significantly different from those of the normal rat, indicating a normal responsiveness of the L cell. However, independent of changes in glycemia, luminal glucose perfusion significantly decreased circulating glucagon levels in normal rats, but not in diabetics. Furthermore, luminal fat administration increased plasma glucagon levels in normal rats only. These results indicate that moderately controlled diabetes is associated with alterations in the pancreatic A cell, but not the intestinal L cell response to ingested nutrients. The results of the present study indicate that the response of the intestinal L cell to ingested food is nutrient-specific and that this specificity is not altered in diabetes. A duodenal-ileal axis is proposed to contribute to increments in circulating intestinal PGDPs in response to nutrient ingestion.\r"

  ".W": "The physiological regulation of intestinal proglucagon-derived peptide secretion has not been well studied. We have therefore used a fetal rat intestinal cell culture model to investigate the control of secretion of the gut glucagon-like immunoreactive (GLI) peptides by other intestinal regulatory peptides in vitro. Secretion of the intestinal GLI peptides was found to be stimulated in a dose-dependent fashion by the intestinal endocrine peptide, gastric inhibitory peptide (at greater than or equal to 10(-10) M, P less than 0.05), and by the neurocrine peptides, gastrin-releasing peptide (at greater than or equal to 10(-12) M, P less than 0.05), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (at greater than or equal to 10(-8) M, P less than 0.05). Gastrin-releasing peptide and its amphibian equivalent, bombesin were equipotent in stimulating GLI peptide secretion. In contrast, the endocrine and neurocrine intestinal somatostatin-related peptides, somatostatin-28 and -14, inhibited release of the GLI peptides, at concentrations of 10(-10) (P less than 0.01) and 10(-8) (P less than 0.01) M, respectively, with significant differences in potency between the two peptides detected at 10(-10) M (P less than 0.05). The inhibitory effects of both somatostatin-28 and -14 could be blocked by preincubation of the cells with pertussis toxin (P less than 0.05). Dose-dependent stimulation of gut GLI peptide secretion was also detected in response to treatment of cultured cells with sodium oleate (at 10(-4) M; P less than 0.05), or with the cholinergic agonist bethanecol (at greater than or equal to 100 microM; P less than 0.05). Other endocrine [cholecystokinin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1(1-37), glucagon-like peptide-1(7-37), glucagon-like peptide-2, neurotensin, and peptide YY] and neurocrine (vasoactive intestinal peptide) peptides, and the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, were without effect on secretion of the gut GLI peptides, at doses of 10(-12) to 10(-6) M. The results of the present study therefore demonstrate that secretion of the intestinal proglucagon-derived peptides is under the regulatory control of a wide variety of intestinal endocrine and neurocrine peptides, as well as nutrients (fats) and neurotransmitters (acetylcholine).\r"

  ".W": "A novel complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the chicken GH receptor was isolated from a chicken liver cDNA library, using polymerase chain reaction with primers derived from highly conserved sequences of the mammalian GH receptor. The nucleotide sequence predicts a mature protein of 592 amino acids and a 16 amino acid signal peptide that are partially homologous to the sequence reported for the rabbit (53%), rat (58%), and human (50%) GH receptors. Despite this low level of homology, a number of structural features of the GH receptor are conserved, including 7 cysteine residues in the extracellular domain and 5 in the intracellular region. Three transcripts of approximately 4.7, 4.0, and 1.0 kilobases are present on Northern blots of total RNA prepared from the livers of 35-week-old male chickens. Expression of the GH receptor was also detected in a wide range of tissues. The chicken GH receptor cDNA was then used as a probe in Southern and Northern blot analyses of DNA and RNA prepared from livers of sex-linked dwarf chickens, which have undetectable levels of hepatic GH-binding activity, in addition to other endocrine abnormalities. A restriction fragment length polymorphism was found in DNA, and an aberrantly-sized transcript was found in hepatic RNA of the dwarf chicken. These results indicate that a mutation in the GH receptor gene is responsible for the phenotype of the sex-linked dwarf chicken. This type of dwarfism resembles Laron-type dwarfism in humans, where a defect in the GH receptor gene has recently been identified. These receptor-deficient chickens should serve as a unique model system for studying the role of the GH receptor in growth and development.\r"

Sections from one of the female brains were subjected to computer-assisted microscopic mapping to generate a three-dimensional analysis of immunoreactive structures. In all six brains examined, cell bodies were concentrated in the preoptic area and basal hypothalamus, but were also evident in the septal region, anterior olfactory area, and cortical and medial amygdaloid nuclei. GnRH-containing fibers were observed within the hypothalamus (predominantly infundibular region and preoptic area), septum, stria terminalis, ventral pallidum, dorsomedial thalamus, olfactory stria, and anterior olfactory area. Many fibers could also be seen coursing along the base of the brain between the hypothalamus and cortical and medial amygdaloid nuclei. The localization of GnRH-containing cells and fibers in several of these areas represents new observations in the human brain and suggests a role for the amygdaloid complex in the regulation of gonadotropin secretion. The comprehensive view provided by these data may be useful in the clinical application of novel transplantation strategies.\r"

  ".U": "91243668\r", 
  ".W": "Using antisera raised against the N-terminal (1-16) or the C-terminal part of the bombesin (BBN)-like peptide gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and against the C-terminus of pro-GRP, GRP- and pro-GRP-like immunoreactivity (IR) was detected by immunostaining in freshly dispersed rat anterior pituitary (AP) cells and in reaggregate AP cells cultured in serum-free medium. Depending on the antiserum used, 6.4 +/- 0.4% to 12.4 +/- 2.7% of freshly dispersed cells were immunoreactive. Solid phase preabsorption of the antisera with the respective antigens abolished the staining. GRP-IR was detectable by double immunostaining in a subpopulation of PRL cells and ACTH-containing cells. In contrast, only very few somatotrophs, gonadotrophs, and thyrotrophs were immunoreactive, and they were much smaller than the typical mature forms of these cell types. GRP- and pro-GRP-IR were also detected in the ACTH-secreting AtT20 cell line and in the PRL- and GH-secreting GH3 cell line. GRP- and pro-GRP-IR were present in AP cell aggregates maintained in culture for 4 weeks. The finding of both GRP- and pro-GRP-IR in a subpopulation of lactotrophs and corticotrophs and their persistence in culture under serum-free conditions strongly suggest that GRP-like peptides are produced in rat AP. Although the potent GRP receptor antagonist L 686,095-001C002 effectively blocks stimulation of GH and PRL release by exogenous BBN-like peptides, it failed to affect basal GH and PRL release from perifused reaggregate AP cell cultures as well as GH and/or PRL release stimulated by epinephrine, vasoactive intestinal peptide, TRH, GH-releasing factor, and angiotensin-II or PRL release inhibited by dopamine. Thus, the latter data do not support the hypothesis often suggested that peptides endogenously present in AP cells are involved in the paracrine regulation of AP hormone secretion.\r"

The rat 7B2 nucleotide and amino acid sequences were highly homologous to those of mouse, human, pig, toad, and salmon. Northern analysis revealed 7B2 expression in rat pituitary and brain and in the PC12 and RIN5F cell lines. A DNA clone containing the 5' end of the rat 7B2 gene was isolated from a rat genomic DNA library. A 3.5-kb fragment isolated from this clone contained 1.5 kb of 5' nontranscribed DNA and 2 kb of the transcriptional unit. Nucleotide sequence and primer extension analyses revealed a TATA-like sequence approximately 25 basepairs up-stream of the transcription start site. Sequence analysis also revealed three putative cis-acting elements in the 5' flanking region. The second exon encoded the first 73 amino acids of the 7B2 prepeptide. Plasmids containing the 7B2 promoter fused with a reporter gene were transiently transfected into LAN-5 cells. Expression was evident only when the first intron was included with the 5' flanking sequences in the construct and only when cells were treated with forskolin or a phorbol ester. The rat 7B2 gene and cDNA will be valuable tools for the identification of factors that regulate 7B2 gene expression.\r"

  ".U": "91243671\r", 
  ".W": "Fenfluramine is an amphetamine derivative which is used as a weight-reducing agent in the treatment of obesity. It has been postulated that fenfluramine affects brain serotonin (5HT) neurons resulting in decreased food intake and altered autonomic outflow which, in turn, increases metabolism. CRF decreases food intake and, in addition, has been demonstrated to reduce body weight in genetically obese rats through selective activation of sympathetic and inhibition of parasympathetic outflows. Because 5HT is a potent CRF secretagogue, we tested the hypothesis that the weight-reducing effects of fenfluramine administration may be mediated, in part, through altered CRF secretion. Chronic fenfluramine treatment (1-24 mg/kg sc, twice daily, 4 days) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in hypothalamic CRF concentration at 30 min after the final drug injection and was accompanied by a significant reciprocal increase in plasma corticosterone concentration. These data suggest that the decrease in hypothalamic CRF was a consequence of increased CRF secretion. These changes in hypothalamic CRF and plasma corticosterone correlated with brain fenfluramine levels. In contrast, high dose fenfluramine treatment significantly increased hippocampus, midbrain, and spinal cord CRF concentrations whereas levels in cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, thalamus, pons/medulla, and cerebellum were unaffected. There was no effect of this fenfluramine treatment protocol on regional brain TRH or neurotensin concentrations. In keeping with the well known development of tolerance to the weight-reducing effects of fenfluramine, chronic fenfluramine treatment resulted in lesser increases in corticosterone secretion than after acute treatment. Whereas weight loss observed after chronic fenfluramine treatment was associated with stimulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, the weight-recovery phase after cessation of drug treatment was associated with decreased levels of plasma corticosterone. These data, demonstrating fenfluramine-induced alterations in brain CRF and plasma corticosterone, suggest that CRF may represent an important endogenous transmitter which mediates the weight-reducing effects of the drug.\r"

Being present in pancreatic tissue, the 27-amino acid peptide could play a role in the control of the glucose-induced insulin secretion of islets of Langerhans. In the presence of a stimulatory glucose concentration, GRP augmented insulin secretion of isolated islets in batch incubations. The peptide did not affect 56Rb+ efflux in the presence of 3 or 5.6 mM glucose but reduced the increase of 86Rb+ efflux evoked by the calcium ionophore A23187. 45Ca2+ uptake and intracellular recorded electrical activity induced by glucose were amplified by GRP. It is suggested that GRP plays a role in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion by increasing the uptake of Ca2+ directly or by inhibition of the Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channel activity and reduced repolarization of the cell.\r"

In addition, adrenal hypertrophy was observed in the morphine-pelleted shams (50% increase in adrenal weight relative to placebo. The magnitude of splenic and thymic atrophy was reduced by about 50% in adrenalectomized morphine-pelleted mice (17% and 22% reductions, respectively) compared to that in adrenalectomized mice implanted with placebo pellets. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to the T-cell mitogen Concanavalin-A and the B-cell mitogen bacterial lipopolysaccharide were also significantly reduced in the morphine-pelleted sham mice. Morphine-induced suppression of Concanavalin-A- or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was absent in adrenalectomized mice. Effects similar to adrenalectomy (e.g. lessening of magnitude of morphine-induced suppression of lymphoid organ weight and lymphocyte proliferation) were found in morphine-pelleted mice given the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 at a dose of 10 mg/kg, twice daily. These studies imply that morphine-induced immunosuppression is at least in part mediated by the increase in serum corticosterone levels after implantation of the morphine pellet.\r"

The distribution pattern of these forms appeared totally distinct from that of individual TSH alpha (pI 8.8, 8.4, 8.2, 7.6, 7.4, 6.8, 6.6, 5.8, and 5.4) and TSH beta (pI 8.7, 8.1, 7.2, 6.8, 6.2, and 5.8) subunits. While most anti-TSH polyclonal antibodies recognized neutral and alkaline isoforms of TSH (pI 8.6, 8.3, 8.0, 7.5, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0) through beta determinants, they displayed a variable potency to bind acidic forms of the hormone (pI 5.8, 5.5, 4.8, and 4.5), in contrast to anti-TSH alpha antisera, which enlighted the broadest spectrum of isoforms. Monoclonal antibodies of various specificities largely reproduced this distribution, indicating that at least five distinct epitopes are coexpressed in the neutral and alkaline forms of TSH, but only two are expressed in the acidic ones. All of the forms were found to induce cAMP production and stimulate growth of FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, although neutral forms proved to be definitely less potent than the others. We therefore, conclude that TSH isoforms differ in the expression of both their immunoreactive and bioactive domains and that the bioactive/immunoreactive ratio is not an accurate index for the biopotency of the hormone.\r"

  ".W": "Although previous studies have demonstrated that exogenous administration of oxytocin (OT) enhances sexual receptivity in female rats, there is no compelling evidence that endogenous OT has a physiological role in the regulation of female sexual behavior. In the current studies we centrally administered d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2Thr4,Tyr-NH2(9)]ornithine vasotocin (or OTA), a selective OT receptor antagonist, to block endogenous OT in ovariectomized females primed with different levels of gonadal steroids. After OTA administration (100-1000 ng), females primed with estradiol benzoate (EB; 1 microgram) and progesterone (P; 250 micrograms) showed reductions in both receptive and proceptive behaviors. These effects of OTA were also evident, though less striking, in females primed with higher doses of EB (10 micrograms) and P (250 micrograms), but significant OTA effects were absent in females primed with EB (10 micrograms) alone. Thus, OTA appeared to attenuate P's facilitation of sexual behavior. Surprisingly, these behavioral effects of OTA administration were not apparent immediately, but emerged only when OTA was given with P 4-6 h before behavioral testing. To determine if these delayed, but lasting, behavioral effects were associated with OTA occupancy of the OT receptor, we measured OT receptor binding ex vivo using receptor autoradiography. Six hours after intracerebroventricular administration of OTA (1000 ng), OT receptor binding was reduced at least 75% in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus relative to control levels of binding. Thus, those OT receptors previously implicated in the regulation of sexual receptivity appear to be significantly blocked throughout the period of OTA's behavioral effects. Together, these studies lend support to the hypothesis that endogenous OT has a physiological role in the regulation of female sexual behavior.\r"

  ".U": "91243676\r", 
  ".W": "The two peptides pancreastatin and diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) were recently demonstrated in pancreatic islets and were shown to inhibit insulin secretion in short term experiments. In the present study we investigated long term effects of pancreastatin and DBI on the DNA synthesis, polyamine content, and insulin secretion of pancreatic beta-cells in tissue culture. For this purpose fetal rat pancreatic islets enriched in beta-cells were isolated and cultured for 3 days at different concentrations of rat pancreastatin and porcine DBI. It was found that pancreastatin dose-dependently decreased beta-cell DNA synthesis, reaching maximal inhibition at 100 nM. In parallel with this, pancreastatin also decreased insulin secretion and the islet contents of insulin and the polyamines spermidine and spermine. These effects were abolished by a high glucose concentration or addition of GH. Also, DBI evoked a dose-dependent inhibition of beta-cell DNA synthesis but affected neither the islet contents of insulin or polyamines nor insulin secretion. Like pancreastatin, DBI was ineffective in preventing the increased beta-cell DNA synthesis, insulin content, or secretion in response to high glucose or GH. It is concluded that pancreastatin and DBI inhibit beta-cell DNA synthesis and function in vitro. In the case of pancreastatin these inhibitory effects may be mediated by a decrease in islet polyamine content. It is suggested that pancreastatin and DBI may influence beta-cell replication and function in vivo in an autocrine or paracrine fashion.\r"

  ".W": "We recently reported that a subpopulation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in man interacts with the hormone-binding site of estrogen receptors (ER), competes with [3H]estradiol (E2) uptake, and decreases effective ER concentrations in cell cultures. The present work further characterizes the immunological properties of these antibodies and defines their biological activity. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting techniques, enriched preparations of the natural anti-ER IgG subpopulation (IgGs) were found to specifically immunoprecipitate ER extracted from MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells and to compete with [3H]tamoxifen-aziridine for ER binding. During 18-h incubations IgGs decreased [3H]E2 binding capacity of MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner similar to E2. Like E2 but unlike antiestrogens, this biological effect corresponded to down-regulation of the receptor protein and depended on a mechanism specifically inhibited by actinomycin D. Moreover, IgGs antagonized the decrease of [3H]E2 binding capacity produced by the strong antiestrogen methyl-hydroxytamoxifen; this antagonism was additive to that of E2. On the other hand, IgGs like estrogens increased progesterone receptor concentrations and cathepsin D secretion. The biological activity of IgGs was neutralized by anti-IgG antibodies and by ICI 164,384, a \"pure\" steroid antagonist of E2, confirming that immunoglobulins G were responsible for this activity and acted at the E2-binding site. These observations indicate that some natural antibodies in man can function like potent estrogens on ER and mammary cells.\r"

After growth in male hosts, both the wild-type and Tfm ureter epithelia were induced by SVM to differentiate into a simple columnar epithelium exhibiting the complex folded morphology characteristic of the SV. In SVM plus wild-type mouse URE recombinants, epithelial ARs were induced, and the epithelium expressed the full spectrum of SV secretory proteins. By contrast, in SVM plus Tfm mouse URE recombinants, the Tfm epithelium was genetically incapable of producing functional ARs and failed to produce SV secretory proteins. These data demonstrate in vivo that the induction of SV secretory proteins by androgens is an event requiring intraepithelial ARs. In contrast, androgen-dependent epithelial morphogenesis, columnar cytodifferentiation, and probably also proliferation can be expressed in Tfm epithelium grown in association with wild-type mesenchyme, strongly suggesting that these events are indirect effects on the epithelium mediated by mesenchymal ARs.\r"

  ".W": "By microinjection of Lucifer yellow (LY) and analysis of the cell to cell transfer of the fluorescent probe, we have examined 1) the ability of thyroid cells in primary culture to reconstitute gap junctions and 2) the effects of extracellular signals on the functional activity of these junctions. Isolated thyrocytes cultured in tissue culture-treated petri dishes either formed monolayers or reorganized in follicular structures in the presence of the glycoprotein hormone TSH. In both culture conditions, LY-coupled cells were evident after 24-36 h. The communication between cells forming a reconstituted thyroid follicle was maintained for up to 9 days. In contrast, the dye coupling between cells in monolayer progressively decreased with time. The cell to cell communication, i.e., the number of dye-coupled cells in thyroid cell monolayer, was increased by TSH in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The TSH action was not related to de novo protein synthesis. (Bu)2cAMP exhibited stimulatory effects similar, in terms of time course and amplitude of action, to those of TSH. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate rapidly inhibited both basal and TSH- or (Bu)2 cAMP-activated cell to cell communication. The dye coupling of cells in reconstituted follicles was also blocked by a short 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate treatment in both the presence and absence of TSH. Our data show that thyroid cells in culture, regardless of the full expression of the differentiated phenotype, rapidly reestablish intercellular gap junctions. The functional activity of gap junctions appears to be regulated 1) positively by a hormone, TSH, probably acting via the cAMP and protein kinase-A pathway, and 2) negatively by phorbol esters through the activation of protein kinase-C, the two regulatory pathways being interdependent.\r"

Inhibin is known also to modify responses to gonadotrophins in the ovary after stimulation times of hours or days. Here we show that action for less than 4 min of purified bovine inhibin on ovarian follicles from Xenopus laevis causes a specific, dose-responsive (greater than 10 U/ml) inhibition of the membrane hyperpolarization produced by stimulation with chorionic gonadotrophin. The CG-induced change in follicle membrane potential has previously been shown to be caused by potassium efflux produced by rises in intracellular cAMP. Inhibin did not affect similar hyperpolarization stimulated by 10 microM adenosine. The apparent Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- currents which are often associated with CG action, were not inhibited by inhibin. At concentrations up to 2000 U/ml, inhibin did not significantly alter the timing of CG-induced germinal vesicle breakdown in the oocytes, which may suggest functional action on other developmental processes.\r"

In addition to their effects on FSH synthesis and secretion, inhibin and activin have other biological functions. By contrast, the physiological significance of follistatin was obscure, until it was discovered that follistatin is a binding protein to activin. Since activin binds to follistatin, it is imperative to determine the nature of the activin/follistatin binding complex. Moreover, because inhibin contains a beta-subunit derived from activin, it is important to determine whether inhibin will also bind follistatin. Using a double-ligand blotting technique, we have determined that activin-A has two binding sites for follistatin, whereas inhibin-A has only one binding site for follistatin. Therefore, these results suggest that follistatin binds to both activin and inhibin through the common beta-subunit.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Vaginal US allowed a better analysis of the ovarian stroma.

RESULTS: Hirsutism improved in 72% of the women. Women with regular menses, whether or not they used oral contraceptives (OCs), had the highest response rate to spironolactone (78%), whereas women with irregular menses who did not use an OC had the lowest response rate (55%). Favorable responses were associated with increased severity of hirsutism (P = 0.04) and lower serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (P = 0.05). Responders and nonresponders did not differ significantly in age (P = 0.10), duration of hirsutism (P = 0.14), pretreatment serum testosterone (T) (P = 0.48), or body mass index (P = 0.11). However, when each parameter was divided into subsets, trends toward decreasing response were observed with increasing age, duration of hirsutism over 15 years, and increasing serum T level.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured peripheral T lymphocyte human leukocyte antigen locus-DR (HLA-DR) expression and IL-2 receptor expression using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. We measured soluble IL-2 receptor levels in serum using an ELISA. RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings, our patients had significantly higher HLA-DR expression on peripheral T lymphocytes (5.3 +/- 0.46) as compared with controls (3.5 +/- 0.34) (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01). Seven patients also had elevated IL-2 receptor expression on peripheral T lymphocytes (P less than 0.05). However, soluble IL-2 receptor levels in the serum did not differ significantly from normals.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Apolipoprotein E (Apo E) is a surface component of several classes of plasma lipoproteins and functions as a receptor ligand for the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (B/E) receptor, the hepatic E receptor, and the LDL receptor related protein. In continuing studies of Apo E synthesis by extrahepatic steroidogenic tissue, we have examined Apo E production and its control in cultured human granulosa cells (GC). DESIGN: Human GC obtained at the time of oocyte aspiration for in vitro fertilization were cultured, and the following parameters were measured: progesterone secretion into the medium, Apo E synthesis and secretion, and Apo E messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) content of the GC. RESULTS: Human chorionic gonadotropin induces a decrease in Apo E protein synthesis and Apo E mRNA content. The addition of aminoglutethimide (which blocks cholesterol conversion to pregnenolone) and/or LDL (which provides the cell with cholesterol), both result in an increase in Apo E protein synthesis and Apo E mRNA content. These latter findings are in agreement with studies in nonsteroidogenic cells, which show that Apo E production is positively correlated with cell cholesterol content.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the conditions of a suitable luteal phase in human stimulated cycles, progesterone (P) production by cultured granulosa cells from preovulatory follicles was related to preovulatory serum estradiol (E2) and number of oocytes. DESIGN: Progesterone production was measured in the presence or absence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) using radioimmunoassay; data were compared using Student's t-test; correlations used linear regression. SETTING: In vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) for infertility treatment at hospital Antoine Beclere, Clamart, France; scientific studies at Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unit 187, Clamart, France. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen women, 33 +/- 4 years old, undergoing IVF-ET for nonovarian causes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: High preovulatory E2 usually correlates with high luteal P level. Atretic follicle has reduced follicular E2 production combined with a loss of responsiveness to gonadotropins. RESULTS: Granulosa-luteal cell P production correlated with E2 level (P less than 0.0002). Six cycles, with 14 oocytes recovered per cycle on average, showed reduced plasma E2 per oocyte (P less than 0.001) combined with reduced responsiveness to hCG by granulosa-luteal cells (P less than 0.02). CONCLUSION: Recovery of numerous oocytes might be associated with follicular atresia and deficient luteal phase.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of endometrial biopsies from treated and untreated women from 2 to 8 days after the luteinizing peak (LH) peak. SETTING: Infertility clinic, Jessop Hospital for Women, Sheffield. PATIENTS: Twenty-two normal fertile women received the RU486. A control group of 44 normal fertile women were also assessed. INTERVENTIONS: RU486 was administered to 22 normal women during the first half of the luteal phase and an endometrial biopsy examined 3 days later. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the production and secretion of the D9B1 epitope. RESULTS: When the drug was given 2 days after the LH peak, it prevented appearance of the epitope. When RU486 was administered 5 days after the LH peak, epitope already present in gland cells was subsequently secreted. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that production of the sialo-oligosaccharide is P-dependent, but secretion through established intracellular pathways is P-independent.\r"

DESIGN: A mail survey method was used. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 26 patients, 76 nurses, and 71 physicians from infertility clinics in the United States and Canada. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A rating scale measured the physical and emotional difficulty level of 36 components from the infertility investigation. RESULTS: Nurses rated the emotional and physical distress of patients higher than did patients and physicians, whereas patients rated their distress higher than did physicians. Older nurses and physicians inferred lower levels of physical and emotional distress than did their younger counterparts. A greater breadth of experience with infertility treatments was associated with higher ratings of emotional distress by nurses and lower ratings by physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Patients, nurses, and physicians perceive infertility treatment from unique vantage points creating differences in perceptions that have implications for patient care. Factors including era of professional training, stage of life, and changes resulting from advancing technology are viewed as influencing health care professionals' perceptions of infertility distress.\r"

DESIGN: This was a prospective study designed in a blinded fashion. SETTING: Academic research environment approved by the Institutional Review Board. PATIENTS: Surplus oocytes, donated by patients undergoing in vitro fertilization therapy after gonadotropin stimulation, were analyzed. Semen from a fertile donor was used in all assays. INTERVENTIONS: Five groups of oocytes were considered: (1) immature, prophase I; (2) metaphase I; (3) metaphase II; (4) inseminated, unfertilized metaphase II; and (5) immature, prophase I oocytes matured in vitro to metaphase II. Oocytes were stored in salt solution (pH 7.2) and microbisected before assay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(s): Tight binding of sperm to the zona pellucida under HZA conditions was evaluated after 4 hours of gametes coincubation. RESULTS: Metaphase II oocytes (groups 3 and 4) had significantly higher binding than other groups (P = 0.0001). The mean value of the difference between the two halves (hemizona) was not significant, thus showing a small intra-assay variation for all maturational stages. CONCLUSIONS: Full meiotic competence of human oocytes is associated with an increased zona pellucida-binding potential.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The fluorescence pattern was evaluated at room temperature after a 1-minute incubation in fluorescein diacetate solution, 4 hours and 24 hours after thawing. RESULTS: Healthy human multipronucleate embryos, when exposed to fluorescein diacetate, accumulated intracellular fluorescein and fluoresced brightly under ultraviolet light. On the other hand, embryos presenting submicroscopic cell membranes damage caused by different processes (e.g., high or low temperatures) lost the ability to accumulate intracellular fluorescein. All the ultrarapidly frozen embryos with normal looking blastomeres fluoresced brightly after a short exposure to fluorescein diacetate.

DESIGN: Consecutive serum samples positive for antisperm antibodies by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunobead testing were evaluated for acrosin-binding specificity. SETTING: The patients were followed in an outpatient setting by private infertility specialists. PATIENTS: Sixty-five consecutive infertile referral patients with positive antisperm antibody were evaluated. Clinical follow-up was obtained on 8 of 9 females with evidence of antibody binding to acrosin and 19 of 26 females with no specific binding to acrosin. INTERVENTIONS: Prednisone therapy was given during six courses of intrauterine insemination with husband's sperm. All treatment decisions were made by private physicians independent of the acrosin-binding result. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pregnancy status was obtained as part of a 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: Acrosin-binding specificity was demonstrated in 10 (15%) of the 65 patients. Two of the 8 women (25%) with antibody binding to acrosin and 6 of the 19 women (32%) with antisperm antibodies but no specific binding to acrosin delivered normal children. CONCLUSIONS: Although antibody-binding specificity to acrosin could be demonstrated, a 2-year clinical follow-up showed no difference in pregnancy rates when compared with women with antisperm antibodies showing no binding specificity to acrosin.\r"

DESIGN: Nine hours after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or hCG plus indomethacin, follicles were removed and processed for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Isolated perfused rabbit ovaries were induced to ovulate with PGF2 alpha (100 ng/mL) in the presence and absence of tranexamic acid (0.1, 1.0, or 10 mM), a plasminogen activator inhibitor. RESULTS: The addition of indomethacin to hCG inhibited ovulation and production of PGs without affecting the follicular microvasculature. However, the changes in follicle wall architecture were less pronounced after treatment with indomethacin. Ovulatory efficiency in response to PGF2 alpha (the percent of follicles greater than 1.5 mm that ovulate) was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) by 10 mM tranexamic acid. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PGs induce follicular rupture by activation of proteolytic enzymes located in the follicle wall.\r"

Obstetrical patients were enrolled from four university based family practice clinics; 772 mother-infant pairs were included in the final analyses. A multiple regression analysis found 53% of the variance in infant birth weight to be explained by length of gestation, race, pre-pregnancy weight, weight gain, gender of the infant, highest systolic blood pressure, and smoking. After adjusting for the effects of other independent variables, women who were self-reported smokers delivered infants who weighed 141.8 g less, on the average, than infants of nonsmoking mothers. Women who smoked fewer than 10, 10-19, or 20+ cigarettes per day delivered infants weighing 96 g, 183 g, and 200 g less, respectively, than infants born to nonsmokers, a clear dose-response effect among relatively low-risk obstetrical patients in a primary care setting. Multiple regression analysis within each smoking group found the effect of length of gestation upon infant birth weight to be markedly reduced among the heavy smokers; this indicates a strong association between heavy (one pack a day) smoking and infant birth weight adjusted for length of gestation.\r"

  ".W": "A review of the records of patients attending a rural family practice clinic indicated that 13% had received \"cold shots\" (lincomycin with or without chlorpheniramine). The providers who assumed management of the clinic when the previous physician retired judged these injections inappropriate, but patients believed that they were effective and expected to continue to receive them. This study included 51 consecutive patients seen in the clinic for treatment of a cold and compared those who expected an injection with those who did not. Thirty-four patients (67%) expected an injection but instead received education about upper respiratory tract infections and symptomatic treatment. Half of these patients (17) were not satisfied with this alternative, and 10 reportedly went to another provider for an injection. Compared with patients who did not expect an injection, patients who did were older (P less than .001), had longer duration of symptoms (P less than .02), and were more likely to have tried nonprescription remedies (P less than .001). Analysis of the 1985 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey indicates that the administration of lincomycin is not uncommon (an estimated 800,000 injections were given in 1985) and that lincomycin is more likely to be administered by a rural solo physician practicing in the north central or southern regions of the United States.\r"

Findings of the 1980 and 1981 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys were combined to assess new visits for abdominal pain. A visit to a physician was considered to be for new abdominal pain when: 1) the principal reason for the visit was either stomach or abdominal pain, cramps, or spasms; 2) the visit was not the result of a referral; and 3) the physician had not previously seen the patient for the condition associated with the pain. Abdominal pain was the most frequent reason for a new pain visit. Women sought medical care for new abdominal pain more frequently than men. Most patients saw general practitioners or family physicians for evaluation of their pain, only 5% of patients were subsequently referred, and 6% were hospitalized. Clinical lab tests were ordered in 45% of new abdominal pain visits, while in approximately 20% X-ray procedures were ordered. Seventy percent of the patients were given a prescription, with antacids and antispasmodics being prescribed most frequently.\r"

Only one third of schools nationwide had a required family medicine clerkship; for 36 schools it was scheduled in the third year. Based on the information provided by the 25 (72%) of these 36 programs which responded, the third-year clerkship was likely to be a stand-alone, decentralized six- or eight-week rotation. The curricula were based on a set of \"common problems\" and emphasized those areas which separate family practice from other specialties. Students were most likely to be graded by faculty rating and a multiple choice examination. The curricula of the programs reviewed did reflect the recommendations of the Task Force, but there was great variability across programs.\r"

By reducing administrative waste and emphasizing global budgetary strategies, the single-payer system could promote more efficient health care spending. While single-payer systems create more explicit political conflict over resource allocation, they also have demonstrated an ability to maintain quality of care and reduce bureaucratic intrusions into clinical practice.\r"

Medicare payments to family physicians will increase substantially under the new system. This will enhance the status and attractiveness of the specialty. The new system will decrease physician autonomy in some respects, and it is not clear that it will successfully control spending.

Increased funding for primary care health manpower is one of the pieces that has the potential to increase the attractiveness of primary care specialties to students. The Title VII funding authorization has been critical in the support of many predoctoral, residency, and faculty development programs over the last 15 years and has the potential to become even more critical in the next five to 10 years. Specifically, there needs to be a doubling of the authorization of the funding for both the family medicine and the general internal medicine/general pediatric grant sections. The funding priorities need to be reexamined and service objective funding may need to be included. Predoctoral funding cycles should be added to the general internal medicine/general pediatrics 784 grant cycle. Increased creativity and thought should be given to faculty development programs. The academic disciplines and their professional societies, specifically the Ambulatory Pediatrics Association, the Society of General Internal Medicine, and the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, are supportive of these issues and believe that an increase in funding will increase the effectiveness and output of primary care physicians so that we will be better able to meet the health care needs of our society.\r"

Bi-weekly on-line PP over 200 ml protein-A sepharose gel (group A) or 200 ml sepharose gel (group B) were performed with a Cobe 2997 blood cell separator for a maximum of 19 treatments per patient. 5-FU was given at 1000 mg/m2/d on days 1-5 of a 4-weekly cycle until progression. PP was well tolerated and no severe or life-threatening toxicity was observed. Mild clinical side-effects consisted of fever and chills (36% in group A, 23% in group B). The most common biological effects of PP over protein-A sepharose were significant drops in IgG (66% of pre-PP values), CH50 and C3 (73% of pre-PP values) and a significant generation of C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins. Tumor response rates were 40% for group A, 0% for group B and 20% for group C. The median survival times tended to be longer in group A (17 months) than in group B (10 months) and in group C (9 months). This is the first randomized trial showing some therapeutic advantage in combining PP over protein-A sepharose with conventional chemotherapy in MCRC.\r"

It therefore appears important to quantify flow velocity and volume flow through the arteriovenous fistula in such cases. We used a Vasoview computer controlled system for noninvasive vascular diagnostics based on B-scan \"real-time\" ultrasound for imaging the structure of tissue, combined with pulsed Doppler ultrasound for determination of hemodynamics. Thirty patients (16 males and 14 females, aged 45 +/- 10 years; range 23 to 61 years), with different periods spent on hemodialysis (5.5 +/- 3.1 years, range 1 to 11 years) were included in this study. The average systolic, diastolic and mean blood volume flows were 2131.8 +/- 565.8, 972.0 +/- 309.6 and 728.4 +/- 287.4 ml/min, respectively. The mean blood volume flow was calculated by integration of the area under curve of blood flow in one heart cycle on the Doppler signal. It is calculated by the apparatus and displayed on the screen during measurement. The average blood vessel diameter was 9.1 +/- 1.3 mm (mu +/- omega). The results revealed a marked inter-individual variation in volume flow through arteriovenous fistulae of dialyzed uremics (range 240.0 to 1200.0 ml/min). Doppler ultrasound thus appears to be a valuable method for determination of blood flow through arteriovenous fistula of dialyzed uremics as well as for detection of hemodynamics disturbances of interest, such as turbulent blood flow.\r"

This examination included the measurement of pocket depth with the aid of a periodontal probe, the measurement of SFFR (sulcus-fluid-flow-rate) using standardized filter paper strips and a bacteriological swab of the exit-site. The results obtained demonstrated that SFFR can be measured around percutaneous implants. The measurement of SFFR appeared to be more useful in the monitoring of exit-sites of percutaneous devices than the measurement of pocket depth or the use of bacteriological swabs. Further studies for prolonged periods are necessary to determine whether measurement of SFFR can reliably predict onset of exit-site infection before clinical signs become evident.\r"

Intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase may help cure approximately 50% of the episodes of relapsing for persistent peritonitis. Post-instillation peritoneal fluid cell counts and cultures should be monitored. Radiologic investigation for abdominal wall or intraabdominal abscesses is indicated if intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase fails to eradicate peritonitis.\r"

Serum concentrations of AAG were significantly higher in the non-dialyzed uremic (1.27 +/- 0.47 g/l) and hemodialyzed patients (1.29 +/- 0.33 g/l) than in the volunteers (0.79 +/- 0.09 g/l). The proportions of strongly ConA-reactive AAG fractions were also higher in non-dialyzed uremic (16.7%) and hemodialyzed patients (18.5%) than in volunteers (14.1%). These data may be related to an increase in bi-antennary glycans, as observed in patients on peritoneal dialysis, together with a probable change in sialylation. AAG serum levels and microheterogeneity were similar in non-dialyzed and hemodialyzed patients and did not appear in the dialyzed patients to depend on the type of dialysis membrane used, i.e. cuprophan (CU), cellulose acetate (CA), hemophan (HE), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and polysulfon (PS), in spite of differences in biocompatibility. In patients dialyzed with CA membranes, there was a distinct decrease in the ConA non-reactive fraction (38.0%) and an increase in ConA slightly-reactive (42.2%) and strongly-reactive (19.7%) fractions. Differences in AAG serum levels and ConA reactivity between patients dialyzed with CA and PAN membranes seem to justify further investigations of other acute-phase reactants and immunological parameters.\r"

We examined the impact of 2 years of supervised exercise on cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, and strength in a group of elderly (age 65-74) veterans. Seventy-five patients exercised 3 days/week for 90-minute sessions emphasizing aerobic, flexibility, and strength development. Thirty-six (47%) completed 2 years of a voluntary supervised exercise program (n = 25 with complete data). Over a 2-year follow-up period, cardiovascular outcome variables improved significantly: metabolic equivalents increased 20% (7.4 +/- 2.2 to 9.0 +/- 2.4, P less than 0.001) and submaximal heart rate decreased 7% (68.5 +/- 8.0 to 63.6 +/- 8.4 beats/minute, P = 0.02). Resting heart rate decreased 8% (131.4 +/- 14.8 to 121.0 +/- 18.5 beats/minute, P = 0.06), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Flexibility, measured by hamstring length, improved 11% (57.5 +/- 15.1 to 64.0 +/- 11.1 degrees, P = 0.02). Strength variables did not improve. The study indicates that improvements in cardiovascular function and flexibility achieved by the elderly in the early stages of an exercise program can be maintained for at least 2 years.\r"

Midarm muscle area correlated strongly with upper arm strength (r = 0.68, P less than 0.0001) while midthigh muscle area had a much lower correlation with thigh muscle strength (r = 0.29, P less than 0.0001). These muscle area calculations also include bone area. Lean body mass calculated by bioelectric impedance correlated highly with cumulative muscle strength measured by summing all muscle groups (r = 0.79, P less than 0.0001). To determine whether aging alters muscle strength per unit of muscle mass, additional middle-aged subjects were included, and three groups, middle-aged (55-64) (n = 78), young-old (65-74) (n = 161), and old-old (75+) (n = 57), were compared. A significant age-related trend of decreasing muscle strength per unit of lean body mass was noted. It is concluded that although muscle mass correlates with muscle strength in a healthy older population, use of simple age-independent clinical measurements of body mass should not be used to predict muscle strength.\r"

Data on 659 elderly (greater than or equal to 60 years of age) participants in a survey of two rural, biracial townships were analyzed to describe the frequency and correlates of postural hypotension. Twelve percent of the 659 adults experienced a drop of 10 mmHg or greater in systolic blood pressure on going from sitting to standing (supine measures were not available). This degree of postural hypotension was twice as common for whites as for blacks (14.5% vs 7.5%, P = 0.01). Postural hypotension was associated with elevated sitting blood pressure and showed positive but statistically non-significant relationships with anti-hypertensive medications and leanness. The association between race and postural hypotension persisted after adjusting for these and other risk factors (OR = 2.2, 95% CI:1.2,4.0).\r"

Patients with diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, coronary or cerebrovascular disease, (n = 22) had significantly increased serum levels of conjugated dienes (0.4951 +/- 0.065 O.D./mL) compared to healthy controls (0.2368 +/- 0.028 O.D./mL) (P less than 0.01). The level of conjugated dienes in diabetic patients without complications (0.3854 +/- 0.0316 O.D./mL) was intermediate between the level found in control subjects and the level in patients with diabetic complications. The serum levels of conjugated dienes correlated best with serum triglyceride concentration (r = 0.51) and to a lesser extent with serum glucose concentration (r = 0.36). It is concluded that elderly patients with diabetes, especially those with complications, have increased serum levels of lipid peroxidation by-products. This can not be totally attributed to alterations in serum cholesterol, phospholipid, or triglyceride levels.\r"

The present analysis evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of the perioperative ECG and examines its value as a predictor of early postoperative cardiac events and outcomes during the postoperative year. ECGs obtained preoperatively and on the first 3 postoperative days in 206 men undergoing transurethral prostate resection were analyzed using the Minnesota Code. The occurrence of cardiac events during the operative stay was assessed by measurement of the cardiospecific MB creatine kinase isoenzyme on the first 3 postoperative days and review of the entire clinical course. Twenty-one percent of patients developed postoperative ECG changes, mostly involving the T wave; none had cardiac symptoms or sustained creatine kinase MB elevation. Changes were not significantly more common in men known to have coronary disease. The single patient who had a perioperative myocardial infarction confirmed by enzymes had no codable ECG changes. The specificity of any ECG change for perioperative infarction was 78%; of ST segment changes only, 95%. Only one of the patients (2%) who had postoperative ECG changes had a cardiac event in the year after surgery. Routine perioperative ECGs is of little diagnostic/predictive utility in situations in which the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction is low.\r"

The prevalence rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) and its associated risk factors have been examined in the baseline data. The age-standardized rate of CHD was 23.8/100 in males and 18.1/100 in females. The prevalence rate increased with age until 79 years in males, thereafter declining. The rate increased steadily with age in females. In a multiple logistic model, the following possible predictors of CHD were included: age, cigarette smoking, use of alcohol, exercise, religiosity, years of education, hypertension, diabetes, family history of CHD, body mass index, lipid and lipoprotein variables. The presence of CHD in males was significantly predicted by age, hypertension (odds ratio, OR = 1.40), family history (OR = 2.05), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (OR = 0.78). The significant predictors in females were age, years of education (OR = 0.82), hypertension (OR = 1.45), family history (OR = 1.77), serum triglycerides (OR = 1.30), and HDL cholesterol (OR = 0.73). Hypertension was found to be a stronger predictor of CHD in the younger age group (60-69 years), while diabetes was a predictor of CHD in older males (70-79 years). Our findings require confirmation in the prospective study now in progress.\r"

We retrospectively studied all incident reports during a 1-year period at a large, urban, long-term-care facility to identify residents with skin tears. The overall incidence of skin tears was 0.92 per patient per year. The incidence rate for females, but not for males, increased significantly with age (P = 0.012). The mean length of the skin tear was 1.9 cm +/- 1.4 (mean +/- SD). Eighty percent occurred in the upper extremities, with the most frequent location being the forearm. Almost half of the skin tears reported had an unknown cause. Wheelchairs and accidentally bumping into an object each accounted for a quarter of the skin tears where the cause was known. Transfers and falls contributed to a lesser extent. Impaired mental status was no more likely to be present in residents experiencing a skin tear than in all nursing home residents. Twenty-four of the 147 residents with skin tears had four or more tears, accounting for 40% of all skin tears reported. Ninety-seven percent of the episodes resulted in no attending physicians' orders other than the standing orders. Future studies should be designed to determine if there are adverse consequences of skin tears and to suggest programs to reduce their occurrence.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the frequency with which cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is attempted on residents of American nursing homes. Each author (all members of the Clinical Practice Committee of the American Geriatrics Society) completed a questionnaire in 1989 about policy and practice regarding CPR during 1988 in each of three to seven nursing homes, by questioning the medical or nursing director or the administrator. Because of the vagaries of nursing home record-keeping, data from some homes were allowed when they were \"accurate to within 10%.\" Data from 58 nursing homes, totalling 10,836 bed-years were available. In 33 of these homes, accounting for 5,425 bed-years, CPR was never attempted. CPR was more likely to be foregone in nursing homes with religious affiliation than in nursing homes without (13 of 17 vs 18 of 38; chi 2 = 4.0; P less than 0.05). Religious affiliation was unknown for three nursing homes. Academic affiliation (10 of 16 vs 20 of 37 in non-affiliated nursing homes) and non-profit status (14 of 19 vs 16 of 23 in for-profit nursing homes) did not significantly affect the likelihood that CPR would never be used. In 31 of 54 nursing homes with explicit do not resuscitate (DNR) policies, CPR was never performed, compared to 2 of 4 homes without such policies. For nursing homes with complete data, there were 1,196 deaths in 32 facilities where CPR was never attempted compared to 1,294 deaths for 24 nursing homes with CPR. For 22 nursing homes without CPR, there were 2,172 emergency room transfers compared to 1,363 emergency room transfers in 18 nursing homes where CPR was attempted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Other targets for treating septic shock include neutralizing antibodies to the complement fragment C5a, platelet-activating factor antagonists, and blockade of endothelial cell leukocyte adhesion molecules. Specific blockade of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with septic shock. Moreover, blocking IL-1 and TNF likely has uses in treating diseases other than septic shock. Use of neutralizing antibodies to TNF or to IL-1 receptors have reduced the consequences of infection and inflammation, including lethal outcomes in animal models. The IL-1 receptor antagonist, a natural-occurring cytokine, blocks shock and death due to Escherichia coli and ameliorates a variety of inflammatory diseases. Soluble TNF and IL-1 surface receptors, which bind their respective cytokines, also ameliorate disease processes. Current clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of these anticytokine therapies either alone or together.\r"

  ".W": "Emergence of resistance to antimicrobial agents among previously susceptible organisms continues to be an important obstacle to the successful treatment of bacterial infections. In hospitals, plasmid-mediated resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and monobactams has recently appeared in gram-negative bacilli, due primarily to mutations in TEM- and SHV-type enzymes. Among nosocomial enterococci, vancomycin resistance, beta-lactamase production, and high-level resistance to all aminoglycosides have recently been added to this organism's already formidable armamentarium of resistance properties. Also, resistance to fluoroquinolones and rifampin has been emerging in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In the community, organisms in which resistance plays a particularly important role are shigellae, Haemophilus influenzae, gonococci, and pneumococci, particularly in developing countries. beta-lactamase-producing meningococci have been reported for the first time. The selective pressure generated by the use of antimicrobial agents, together with the ability of bacteria to acquire and spread resistance and the capacity of humans to transmit bacteria, suggest that antimicrobial resistance will continue to be a problem for the foreseeable future.\r"

  ".W": "Early neurosyphilis, characterized by meningitis, cranial nerve abnormalities, and cerebrospinal accidents, was first described in patients with syphilis who received inadequate courses of arsphenamine. Although more effective, penicillin at conventional doses does not yield treponemacidal levels in the central nervous system and probably does not eradicate the infecting organisms, suggesting that it works synergistically with the host's immune response in preventing neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis after penicillin therapy was almost unheard of in the United States until it began to appear in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Numerous cases of syphilitic meningitis, cranial nerve abnormalities, and strokes have been reported in the past decade; about one-half of reported patients had received penicillin therapy, often within the previous 6 months. Thus, more intensive diagnostic evaluation, perhaps including routine cerebrospinal fluid analysis, more intensive therapy, for example with at least three doses of benzathine penicillin, and far more rigorous follow-up are indicated in HIV-infected subjects with syphilis. Since the efficacy of conventional therapy is now uncertain, novel approaches to treatment deserve systematic evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "A novel toxicity associated with zidovudine (AZT), the standard antiviral therapy for infection with human immunodeficiency virus, is described. When AZT was administered to mice to evaluate its safety during gestation, the animals failed to complete pregnancy successfully. Mice receiving AZT during gestation yielded fewer fetuses (P = .003) and greater numbers of resorptions (P = .003) per pregnant mouse compared with untreated animals. Drug effects on adult mice were assessed to determine if toxicity could account for the pregnancy failures. However, adult animals receiving AZT demonstrated no adverse effects with regard to growth, food consumption, activity, or ovarian histology. A direct toxic effect of AZT on the mouse embryo was tested by cultivating single-cell fertilized oocytes in vitro in the presence of increasing concentrations of drug. Exposure to AZT was highly correlated with failure to develop to the blastocyst stage (P less than .001). These data indicate that AZT has a direct toxic effect on the developing mouse embryo. Further analysis of the nature of this toxicity may be important in designing less toxic antiretroviral agents and in planning future uses of AZT.\r"

To establish whether blood from such seronegative but PWM- and PCR-positive monkeys can transmit infection, naive macaques were transfused with whole blood (n = 2) or cultured cells and supernatant fluid (n = 2) from two seronegative but PWM- and PCR-positive sooty mangabeys. After transfusion, three of the four recipients seroconverted, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all four recipients secreted SIV-reactive antibodies upon polyclonal activation in vitro and were SIV-positive by PCR that used highly specific gag primer pairs and probe. In addition, CD8+ cells from all four recipients markedly inhibited replication of SIV in autologous cells in vitro. These data suggest caution in the sole use of serologic tests for the detection of retroviral infection and document the ability of such blood samples to transmit infection.\r"

Sequence analysis of this region (codons 384-717) revealed that the clinical strains and previously sequenced laboratory strains Towne and AD169 belong to one of four variant groups, each with a characteristic nucleotide and peptide sequence. Peptide homology was greater than 99% for strains within a group, and varied from 91% to 98% for strains in different groups. Variation was most frequent between codons 448 and 480. The gB group of a CMV strain could be determined by restriction analysis of a small target sequence amplified from viral genomic DNA, and an additional 28 clinical strains were grouped in this manner. The existence of a limited number of variants of gB among clinical strains facilitates analysis of biologic function and cross-reactivity of immune responses.\r"
