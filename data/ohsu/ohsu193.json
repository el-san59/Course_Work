The anterior-chamber oxygen tension was monitored continuously for two hours following the topical application of three drops of timolol 0.5%. Although a small, but significant, decline in oxygen tension of 19% was observed over the initial 90 minutes (P less than or equal to .05), the overall 10% decrease at the end of two hours was not considered either clinically or statistically significant when compared with a group of controls. Timolol, since it does not contribute significantly to hypoxia, may therefore be a more prudent choice for lowering intraocular pressure in disorders where hypoxia is believed to play an important role, such as in neovascular glaucoma and sickle-cell hyphema.\r"

Hyperlipidemia was present in 12% of the controls and 10.3% of the RVO group (P greater than .50).

While laser iridotomies have proven most effective in the treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma, there is a diversity of opinion regarding the treatment of chronic forms, in particular when the congestive phase has been of long duration (e.g., 3 to 14 days). The fact that ophthalmologists must still contend with the dreaded complication of malignant glaucoma attests to the difficulty of treating this condition. A series of cases have been collected during the past 15 years, all having prolonged episodes of primary angle-closure glaucoma, where the anterior-chamber angles could not be opened medically before surgery. We found that laser iridotomy is not efficacious in this situation, and indeed often impossible to perform due to corneal edema. Our patients were treated surgically with sector iridectomies, with an extremely high degree of success, and a minimal complication rate. The results are presented in tabular form. The mechanism of action is described, and the reasons for the success of this procedure explained.\r"

Of the latter, 19 (65.5%) were myopic (average, 2.00 diopters), 12 (41.4%) had lenticular opacities, and all had unusually deep anterior-chamber angles with prominent iris processes. None of the 29 patients had subluxated lenses. These findings support the view that MVP syndrome can be considered a generalized connective tissue disorder different from Marfan's syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "In the freeze-fractured presynaptic membrane of the motor end-plate, the active zones consist of two parallel arrays and each array contains 10- to 12-nm particles arranged in two rows. In the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and in mice treated with 10 mg/day of LEMS IgG, administered intraperitoneally for several weeks, there was a paucity and disorganization of the active zones, and clusters of 10- to 12-nm particles appeared. To further define the changes in the active zones, mice were studied that had been treated over 2 days with 104 to 180 mg of IgG. Treatment transferred the physiological defect of LEMS. Control mice received normal human IgG or no IgG. The spacing and density (number/unit area) of active-zone particles were evaluated in presynaptic membrane P-faces using computer-assisted stereometry. In the normal active zone, the distance between particles in a given row and between adjacent rows of an array was less than, but the distance between the two arrays was greater than, the distance between the two antigen-binding sites on human IgG. In mice treated with LEMS IgG, the initial alteration in the active zone was a decrease in the distance between particles in a given row and between adjacent rows of an array; the distance between the two arrays remained unaltered. In more affected active zones, the parallel orientation of the rows was disturbed and the arrays became clusters. There was a significantly reduced density of active zones and of large-membrane particles associated with all active zones and clusters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The myoid cells were rare and located mainly in the medulla, and most were clearly positive for AChR; labeling was similar with four individual monoclonal antibodies specific for extrajunctional AChR and five that also recognize endplate AChR. They were mostly keratin-positive and consistently HLA-DR-negative. In the myasthenia gravis samples, the myoid cells were similar but largely confined to medullary epithelial areas; AChR labeling was slightly weaker, but otherwise they did not differ noticeably from those of control subjects. A preliminary finding was of even rarer AChR-positive/HLA-DR-positive antigen-presenting (possibly) cells seen in 9 of 9 myasthenia gravis samples and in none of 9 control samples. Although myoid-cell AChR appears antigenically similar to extrajunctional muscle AChR, and must therefore express the epitopes that myasthenics' antibodies recognize, these cells do not appear to be foci of immunological stimulation in myasthenia gravis.\r"

The fluidity of the hydrocarbon and lipid-aqueous interface regions of cell membranes was determined at 37 degrees C by fluorescence spectroscopy using the lipid probes 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH), respectively. The rotation rate of TMA-DPH in labeled platelet membranes did not differ between the groups. In contrast, the rotation rate of DPH in labeled platelet membranes from the demented patients (2.15 +/- 0.24 X 10(8)/sec, SD) was greater than that for the normal controls (1.93 +/- 0.13 X 10(8)/sec, SD, p = 3.8 X 10(-5)). This difference was reflected by a reduction in the steady-state anisotropy of DPH in labeled platelets from the demented group (0.1887 +/- 0.0085, SD) when compared to the respective mean for the controls (0.2000 +/- 0.0060, SD; p = 1.3 X 10(-7)). Abnormal membrane fluidity was significantly correlated with severity of dementia, but not with duration of illness or apparent age of onset. The findings do not support the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease results from a pathological acceleration of the normal aging process, since normal aging is associated with decreased fluidity of cell membranes from platelets, as well as from lymphocytes, hepatocytes, and neurons.\r"

This study extends the observations back through 1935. The average annual incidence rate for the period 1935 to 1944 was 188 and 179 per 100,000 population for men and women, respectively--not significantly different from 200 for men and 178 for women for the period 1945 to 1954. The blood pressure level in these patients did not affect probability of survival or recurrent stroke. The trend in the incidence rate of stroke for women showed no change for the 20 years from 1935 to 1954, after which there was a gradual decline. For men there was little change until 1969, after which there was a sharp decline. We suggest that the gradual decline in U.S. stroke mortality rates for this early period may include an artifact introduced by changing codes and changing fashions of diagnosis.\r"

To identify differences in the electrophysiological response of specific fiber types to the application of 4-AP, rat ventral and dorsal spinal roots, demyelinated by intrathecal injections of lysophosphatidylcholine, were examined in vitro before and during potassium-channel blockade. The compound action potentials of demyelinated ventral roots showed a prominent postspike negativity associated with a broadening of single action potentials following application of 4-AP. Under similar conditions, whole root responses of demyelinated dorsal root axons also developed a late negativity, but individual fibers were observed to fire repetitively in response to a single stimulus. The data support the hypothesis that the prominent sensory dysfunctions reported in clinical trials of 4-AP are due to the selective response characteristics of sensory fibers.\r"

We now report on 5 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who had a decrease in PNMT activity of 37 to 48% in areas of the brain affected by the disease but not in the cerebellum, an area of the brain unaffected by the disease. The degree of decrease in PNMT activity in the hippocampus correlated significantly with the degree of dementia. We have provided direct immunochemical evidence that the decrease in PNMT activity in AD is due to the loss of this specific enzyme protein.\r"

Blood samples were obtained before, at the end, and at 1 and 6 h after the administration of the antibiotics. Bactericidal activity in serum (SBA) was measured in microtiter plates against 20 clinical isolates (five strains each) of oxacillin-susceptible and-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The endpoint of the SBA corresponded to 99.9% killing. Killing rates were measured in serum obtained at 1 and 6 h. The concentrations of each antibiotic were measured by bioassay. The antibiotic concentrations in serum obtained at the peak and at 1 and 6 h after the end of administration were as follows: group 1, teicoplanin, 26, 15.6, and 8.4 mg/liter; rifampin, not determined, 8.3, and 3.8 mg/liter; group 2, teicoplanin, 66, 29.4, and 11.5 mg/liter; rifampin, 14.8, 3.8, and 1.2 mg/liter. Higher median SBAs were obtained after treatment with rifampin than after that with teicoplanin. No interaction was observed between rifampin and teicoplanin. This was confirmed by determination of the killing rate in serum. Teicoplanin killed more slowly than rifampin. The combination had the same killing rate as rifampin alone. Rifampin neither improved nor antagonized the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin, as determined by the SBAs or the rate of killing.\r"

Ciprofloxacin was given in single intravenous bolus doses of 25 and 35 mg/kg and also in a multiple-dose regimen of 35 mg/kg every 6 h. Vancomycin was given in a similar manner in single doses of 17.5 and 25 mg/kg and in a multiple-dose regimen of 17.5 mg/kg every 6 h. Serum was sampled frequently after injections and analyzed by microbiologic assay for drug concentration. The pharmacokinetic parameters of clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were calculated by compartment-independent methods. These studies revealed that clearance of ciprofloxacin was reduced significantly after multiple doses (7.42 +/- 0.85 [standard deviation] versus 6.09 +/- 0.71 liters/h, P less than 0.01). Although the half-life and volume of distribution increased after multiple dosing, the differences were not statistically significant. The disposition of vancomycin following single doses was significantly altered after the 25-mg/kg dose compared with the 17.5-mg/kg dose. Half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution changed from 1.27 +/- 0.2 to 1.60 +/- 0.21 h (P less than 0.05), 0.54 +/- 0.05 to 0.39 +/- 0.04 liters/h (P less than 0.01), and 0.37 +/- 0.04 to 0.31 +/- 0.03 liters/kg (P less than 0.05), respectively. The disposition of ciprofloxacin was not altered with increases in dose size, and the disposition of vancomycin was not altered after multiple doses. If such alterations in the pharmacokinetic disposition of antimicrobial agents are unanticipated, the higher and more prolonged than expected serum concentrations may have an effect on the outcome of experimental infections.\r"

The efficacies of a variety of antibiotics with different metabolic targets were tested and compared. The most effective antibiotics in bringing about the elimination of the parasite from infected cells included several quinolone compounds and rifampin. Of the quinolone compounds tested, difloxacin (A-56619) was the most effective, followed by ciprofloxacin and oxolinic acid. These three quinolones were apparently rickettsiacidal. After 48 h of exposure to microgram amounts of the compounds (ranging from 2 micrograms of difloxacin per ml to 5 micrograms of the other two antibiotics per ml), the number of intracellular parasites markedly declined; after 10 days of treatment, very few intracellular rickettsiae were detected. Rifampin (1 microgram/ml) was also very effective in eliminating the parasites. Some of the 13 other antibiotics tested that were somewhat effective included chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and trimethoprim. The persistently infected L929 cells were found to provide a convenient system for the relatively rapid determination of the susceptibility of C. burnetii to antibiotics.\r"

In the current studies, a series of experiments was designed to determine the potential antiviral activity of this compound in mice infected with murine hepatitis virus. In a comparative antiviral experiment, the activity seen was superior to that of levamisole, a known immunorestorative agent. This activity was characterized by an increase in the 21-day survival frequency, a decrease in hepatic discoloration, a decrease in the amount of infectious virus recoverable from the liver, and normalization of serum glutamic oxalacetate and pyruvate transaminase levels. A comparison of treatment routes indicated the relative efficacies as intraperitoneal greater than per os greater than intramuscular greater than or equal to subcutaneous. Alteration of the treatment schedule markedly affected the antiviral effect; prophylactic or therapeutic treatments once or twice daily for 3 days were usually effective. Single treatments begun 4 h before or 24 h after virus inoculation were highly efficacious. Three treatments administered on alternate days, beginning 48 h before virus inoculation, proved moderately effective. Thrice-daily treatments were ineffective, as were treatments with durations of greater than 3 days. The optimal dosage varied according to the treatment route and dosage schedule. When assessed for direct antiviral activity in vitro, PR-879-317A failed to demonstrate any significant activity against murine hepatitis virus. The positive in vivo activity noted might therefore be the result of immune modulation rather than a direct antiviral effect.\r"

Moxalactam (a cephamycin antibiotic which will be referred to as a cephalosporin for convenience throughout), which contains the MTT side chain, was used as a positive control and was administered at 100 to 1,000 mg/kg per day, and cephalothin, which lacks an MTT side chain, was used as the negative control at 1,000 mg/kg per day. Moxalactam caused a significant reduction in testicular and seminal vesicle weights in 37-day-old animals, and histological examination revealed bilateral multifocal atrophy of the seminiferous tubules at all dose levels. Animals reared to reproductive maturity had significant deficits in fertility, and histological examination revealed multifocal or diffuse atrophy of the seminiferous tubules at all doses with a severity greater than that observed in the 37-day-old animals. The histological findings were confirmed by marked reductions in testicular sperm production rates and cauda epididymal sperm numbers. Cephalothin and cefonicid had no treatment-related adverse effects on the sexual maturation of prepubertal, juvenile, or adult males. The absence (in cephalothin) or modification (in cefonicid) of the MTT side chain was not associated with adverse reproductive effects. The relevance of these findings to humans in prenatal and prepubertal stages of life cannot be determined at this time.\r"

All patients combed with fine-toothed combs immediately after therapy. They were examined for tolerance and efficacy at 24 to 48 hours and again at ten days (eight- to 12-day range). In the lindane group, ten (40%) of 25 subjects were infested at the final assessment. In the permethrin group, 12 (43%) of 28 subjects were infested at the final assessment. The difference was not statistically significant. Both treatments were well tolerated, with one mild adverse reaction in each group. We concluded that both agents were equivalent in the treatment of PP. On the basis of the high failure rate, we propose that the therapy of PP with any agent should include a second treatment at ten days.\r"

Of 575 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma treated and followed up by the Division of Surgical Oncology at the University of Illinois, Chicago, we found that 103 (18%) had tumors that measured less than 0.76 mm. Of these, 30 (29%) showed histologic evidence of partial regression. In six (20%) of the 30 patients, visceral metastases developed and the patients died. All six had more than 77% regression of their primary tumors. Of the remaining 24 patients, only one had regression greater than 77% and she is still alive three years after diagnosis. Most of these 24 (83%) patients had regression of less than 50% (mean, 29.9%). No metastasis occurred in the 73 patients who had thin melanomas without histologic evidence of regression. It is apparent from this study that patients with thin melanomas who show partial regression cannot be included in the \"low-risk\" group if the extent of regression is 75% to 80% or more.\r"

Melanomas arising from the palms, soles, subungual regions, and mucous membranes tended to be advanced in stage, to occur in older individuals, and to metastasize. These cases explain the generally poorer prognosis for Hispanic patients compared with whites. The epidemiology of melanoma relevant to these findings is discussed.\r"

The clinical and histologic features of PLEVA in our cases were similar to those reported for adults, except that no lesions were observed on the scalp or mucous membranes of children. A high index of suspicion and biopsy specimens of suspected lesions are often needed to differentiate PLEVA from other papular and crusted eruptions seen in the pediatric age group. These include reactions to arthropods, Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, varicella, and erythema multiforme. Histologically, papular eczema and pityriasis rosea may be misdiagnosed as PLEVA.\r"

Histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy specimen revealed golden-brown colored mycelial elements, and culture resulted in growth of a dematiaceous fungus identified as Exserohilum rostratum. Surgical excision of the abscess and concomitant oral therapy with ketoconazole resulted in resolution of symptoms. In previously reported cases of human phaeohyphomycosis caused by Exserohilum and related Bipolaris species in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts, treatment has varied from topical antimicrobial therapy to combined surgery and intravenous antifungal chemotherapy. Our experience leads us to believe that surgical debridement of an accessible focus of infection along with orally administered ketoconazole may provide adequate therapy in an immunocompetent host.\r"

With chemotherapy, the recurrent and metastatic lesions of Merkel cell carcinoma completely resolved, rapidly recurred, and resolved a second time with chemotherapy. Eight months following the fourth course of chemotherapy, the patient again developed widespread cutaneous lesions. He committed suicide within one month of this last recurrence. An autopsy revealed no primary tumor other than of the skin.\r"

Eighty-five percent to 90% of DH patients have granular deposits of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction, and essentially all of these patients have an associated, for the most part asymptomatic, gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). The association of GSE and DH suggested that the cutaneous manifestations of DH could be controlled by the use of a gluten-free diet. Institution of a gluten-free diet in patients with DH and granular IgA deposits has been shown to be effective in controlling the cutaneous eruption of DH. Seventy percent to 100% of patients who begin a strict gluten-free diet have been shown to be able to decrease the dosage of medication needed to control their DH after a mean of eight to 18 months on the diet. Furthermore, 40% to 70% of patients with DH can control their skin disease completely, without any medication, after longer periods of time on the gluten-free diet (two years and longer). Although the gluten-free diet has been shown to be of great benefit in the control of the skin manifestations of DH, at the present time there is no evidence to suggest that the gluten-free diet is in any way protective against the risk of intestinal lymphoma that has been documented in GSE. Evaluation of the cutaneous IgA deposits in DH skin after long periods of time on a gluten-free diet suggests that there may be a slight decrease in the intensity of the IgA deposits, but the true pathogenetic relationship between the cutaneous IgA deposits, the cutaneous manifestations of DH, and the associated GSE remains unknown.\r"

Using cultured fibroblasts, we have shown that low extracellular copper concentrations induce synthesis of metallothionein, a copper-binding protein, in Menkes' cells but not in normal cells. This is due to a defect in a diffusable regulatory factor that is probably involved in copper metabolism. To further understand the role of the defective factor in transcription, assays have been developed to study the metal-dependent binding of nuclear proteins to metallothionein gene control sequences.\r"

Twelve per cent (of 249) were excreting virus at 3 months, and 20% (of 234) at 12 months. In all cases infection was subclinical. The major factors determining risk of acquiring infection were the mother's serological state and whether the infant was breast fed. There was no association with social class, mother's age, or whether the child had been in a special care baby unit or a postnatal ward. By one year 33% (of 123) of infants of seropositive mothers had acquired CMV infection compared with 4% (of 123) born to seronegative mothers. Twenty per cent (17) of seropositive women who breast fed had virus isolated from their breast milk on at least one occasion, and 76% (13) of their infants became infected. In four mother-infant pairs comparison of CMV isolates from the mother's milk and the child's urine was made by restriction endonuclease digestion; in each pair infection had apparently occurred with the same strain of virus. All 13 infected infants followed up for three years were still shedding virus. Infection with CMV is common in infancy, and virus shedding persists for years. Congenital infection cannot be distinguished from acquired infection unless the presence of CMV in the urine is identified within three or four weeks after birth, even when clinical problems suggestive of congenital infection are present.\r"

Reported rates of admissions to hospital for lower respiratory tract diseases were found to be as high in children born to mothers who stopped smoking during pregnancy as in those whose mothers smoked continuously both during and after pregnancy. Rates of admissions to hospital for lower respiratory tract diseases in children whose mothers started smoking only postnatally were no higher than in those whose mothers remained non-smokers. Postnatal smoking seemed to exert a significant influence on the reported incidence of bronchitis, but less than smoking during pregnancy. These findings suggest that maternal smoking influences the incidence of respiratory illnesses in children mainly through a congenital effect, and only to a lesser extent through passive exposure after birth.\r"

The concentrations and outputs of secretory IgA in urine were significantly higher in the breast fed group by a factor of three. The secretion of IgA in urine by the breast fed infants was characteristic of the baby and was not related to the intake of IgA from breast milk. Lactoferrin concentrations were similar in the two groups at both ages. In addition to secretory IgA, two thirds of all samples contained proteins with alpha chain but no secretory component antigenic determinants. Breast feeding seems to increase the local production of secretory IgA into the urinary tract during early childhood, thus providing enhanced protection from infection.\r"

The correct diagnosis was suggested by fluctuating signs and symptoms, which worsened towards evening, but this was reached only after many years of handicap, hospital admissions, and invasive diagnostic procedures. Typically there was a prompt, pronounced, and sustained response to moderate doses of levodopa. Sleep recordings were obtained in three patients and showed increased body movements during rapid eye movement sleep. Several close relatives had periods of increased leg movements during sleep. It is suggested that hereditary dystonia responsive to levodopa should be considered as the diagnosis in children with fluctuating signs of motor disability syndromes, simulating torsion dystonia or spastic diplegia. Polysomnographic studies may be helpful in diagnosis and may also detect early or subclinical cases.\r"

Seven of 21 patients with raised HbA1 concentrations were glucose intolerant. The remaining 14 patients with raised HbA1 concentrations had normal glucose tolerance but a reduced C peptide response, suggesting impaired islet cell function. There were no appreciable differences in the incidence of chest infections, respiratory function, and chest x-ray scores among patients with normal HbA1 concentrations, raised HbA1 concentrations, and normal oral glucose tolerant tests, and patients who were glucose intolerant. No correlation was found between HbA1 concentration and age or Shwachman score.

No clinically important differences were found between the two treatments when symptom scores, symptom free days, additional use of salbutamol, and results of lung function tests were considered. Metyrapone mildly reduced the plasma concentration of 11-deoxycortisol in two patients during treatment with budesonide, and in four during treatment with beclomethasone.

Thirty five (19%) of the mothers assessed themselves as anxious and two as depressed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Anxious and depressed mothers were significantly more likely to assess their child as being disturbed. In contrast, the teachers' assessments of the children were not affected by the mental state of the mothers.

A study of 1260 children aged 1-5 showed that the thresholds of these two variables yielded significantly different proportions of children with malnutrition, the proportion being much larger when arm circumference was used as the criterion. Adjusting the thresholds would result in closer correspondence between the two variables.\r"

I have made no mention of mistakes that could theoretically be made but that I have not personally seen. I believe that most assessment errors are due to overconfidence and to the view that developmental diagnosis is easy. Many other mistakes are due to reliance on purely objective tests with consequent omission of a detailed history and physical examination, so that factors that profoundly affect development but are not directly related to the child's mental endowment are not weighed up before an opinion is reached.\r"

Environmental group concentrations of chrysotile fibers longer than 5 microns were significantly higher than those of referents, and 50% lower than those observed in the occupational group. Tremolite was markedly increased in the occupational group, but only marginally greater in the environmentally exposed. Electron-microscopy-derived concentrations of amphibole fibers longer than 5 microns correlated well with light microscopic asbestos body counts in the occupational group but not in the environmental or referent groups. Chrysotile concentration was not related to asbestos body concentration in any group. Crocidolite fiber, a commercial amphibole not native to the region, was nonetheless identified in lung tissue from 15 of 23 chrysotile miners and millers. Environmental exposure to asbestos fiber as a result of residence within 40 km of the mines results in increased lung chrysotile content.\r"

Similarly, a dose-response relationship between alcohol use and laryngeal cancer (p less than .05) was identified. The risk for laryngeal cancer was increased synergistically by alcohol and tobacco. After controlling for alcohol and tobacco, the only occupational category with an elevated risk was nonconstruction laborers (OR = 3.82; 95% confidence interval = 1.87-5.77).

The airway symptoms were significantly (p less than .005) associated with a decrement in spirometric lung function before and after adjustment for age, height, and duration of employment. The change in residual pulmonary function (PFT) per year of employment was three times higher for the subjects with airway symptoms than for subjects presenting no symptoms. Lifetime alcohol intake was significantly (.025 greater than p less than .01) negatively correlated with pulmonary function and obstructive and restrictive lung disease parameters. Together with body weight, alcohol bottle-years accounted for between 18 and 22% of the variation in lung function, in a forward and reverse stepwise regression analysis. When duration of employment was standardized, subjects with considerable alcohol intake had significantly (.025 greater than p less than .005) lower pulmonary function before and after adjustment for age and height. When the residual PFT was further adjusted for duration of employment, the subjects with higher alcohol intake had significantly (.01 greater than p less than .005) higher residual per year of employment. The subjects presenting airway symptoms had significantly (.05 greater than p less than .005) higher alcohol intake than those in other symptom categories. These data suggest that alcohol intake is a probable confounder in the observed airway and PFT changes.\r"

The comparison group consisted of the 1980 United States Census population of men who resided in the same towns as did the farmers. The results indicated that the study cohort experienced fewer than the expected numbers of deaths overall and for each major cause category except accidents. Specific causes with significant mortality deficits included cancer of the lung (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 47.0); diabetes mellitus (SMR = 57.5); ischemic heart disease (SMR = 65.3); bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma (SMR = 26.7); and cirrhosis of the liver (SMR = 29.7). The only specific cause with a significantly elevated mortality was accidents other than motor vehicle (SMR = 146.5). The investigation differs from previous research in method, setting, and population, but the pattern of findings is generally consistent with that of other studies.\r"

Whole blood selenium was significantly lower and plasma lipid peroxides were significantly higher in power plant workers when compared to the nonindustrial group. In the rubber factory workers, whole blood selenium and red blood cells and plasma glutathione peroxidase activities were significantly lower than in the control group. Urinary output of selenium was also significantly decreased in rubber factory workers. Slightly elevated lipid peroxides were also observed in that group. It seems reasonable to conclude that the lower blood selenium and decreased urinary output of this element may result from increased loss of selenium with perspiration.

The variables believed to be important prognostically were recorded for 984 consecutive PTAs performed between July 1978 and July 1986. Success or failure was defined using a combination of clinical and objective vascular laboratory criteria. The overall long-term success was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and differences between curves of success rate versus time for each variable were determined by the Wilcoxon and log-rank statistics. The combination of variables associated with success were determined by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. For all cases, the initial success rate was 88.6 +/- 1.0% and at 5 years was 48.2 +/- 2.3%. The following variables, when considered individually, were associated with success (p less than 0.05): indication for PTA, site of PTA, severity of lesion, runoff, number of sites dilated, diabetes, and the occurrence of a complication. From the Cox model, by using a stepwise multiple regression procedure, the following combination of variables were found to be predictive of success (p less than 0.05): (1) indication (claudication vs. salvage), (2) site (common iliac vs. other), (3) severity of lesion (stenosis vs. occlusion), and (4) runoff (good vs. poor). For all combinations of these four significant variables, curves of the success rate versus time were calculated. In conclusion, this study has identified the combination of four variables that together predict if PTA is likely to be successful in the management of a patient with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.\r"

  ".W": "Existing Roux-en-Y bile diversion procedures for duodenogastric reflux coupled with distal gastric resection or antrectomy and vagotomy have varied success due to interruption of the physiologic relationships between stomach and duodenum, the reduction of the gastric reservoir, the side effects of vagotomy, and the effect of the Roux limb on gastric emptying. A new bile diversion procedure, suprapapillary Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy, was studied, which eliminates the need for gastric resection to prevent jejunal ulcers by preserving duodenal inhibition of gastric acid secretion and the protective effects of duodenal secretion on the surrounding mucosa. Experimentally, the incidence of jejunal ulceration was significantly decreased by the preservation of the proximal duodenum. Clinically, bile diversion by suprapapillary Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy alleviates symptoms of duodenogastric reflux disease without being ulcerogenic (in the presence of normal gastric secretion) or prolonging gastric emptying.\r"

  ".U": "88023010\r", 
  ".W": "Repair of major venous injuries of the extremities has been advocated to improve limb salvage rates and to prevent the early and late sequelae of venous interruption. The contribution of venous repair to the surgical outcome remains controversial, however, in part because the fate of venous reconstruction has previously not been well defined. The current study was done to determine the early patency rate of venous repair, to compare the accuracy of various methods used to assess venous patency, and to analyze the relationship between early venous patency and surgical outcome. During a recent 27-month period, 36 patients with major extremity venous injuries were treated by venous reconstruction; 34 patients (94%) had an associated major arterial injury that also required repair. Venous repair was performed in the upper extremity (22%) as well as the lower extremity (78%) using various reconstructive methods, including lateral repair (17%), end-to-end anastomosis (11%), autogenous vein patching (25%), interposition autogenous vein grafting (42%), and panelled autogenous vein grafting (6%). After operation, venous repair patency was evaluated by clinical examination, impedence plethysmography, and Doppler ultrasonography, and contrast venography. There were no perioperative deaths in these 36 patients. The limb salvage rate was 100% and all 34 major arterial repairs were patent at the time of hospital discharge. Venography performed on the seventh postoperative day demonstrated that 14 venous repairs had thrombosed (39%) and that 22 had remained patent (61%). Local venous repair had a significantly lower thrombosis rate (21%) than those requiring interposition vein grafting (59%) (p less than 0.03). Compared with venography, the clinical evaluation was 67% accurate in the assessment of venous repair patency, and the noninvasive examination was 53% accurate. In conclusion, a substantial percentage of venous repairs will thrombose in the postoperative period, especially if interposition vein grafting is used. However, in this series limb salvage was not adversely influenced by an unexpectedly high rate of venous repair thrombosis. In addition, clinical evaluation and noninvasive testing did not provide an accurate assessment of venous patency after venous repair.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1964 and 1984, 430 patients with complex reflux problems were managed by a modified Collis gastroplasty and partial fundoplication. The indications for selecting the addition of gastroplasty were as follows: (1) obvious acquired shortening due to peptic esophagitis and stricture, and (2) subtler degrees of acquired shortening frequently encountered in cases that required reoperation and in patients with massive sliding hiatal hernia. The addition of gastroplasty in this second group obviates the risk of even minimal tension on the repair. Follow-up is complete in 382 patients (90%), and extends 1-20 years. Two hundred fifty patients have been followed up for 5 or more years and 101 patients for more than 10 years. Results were classified as follows: good: asymptomatic, or inconsequential symptoms requiring no therapy; fair: improved, but with symptoms and/or endoscopic findings requiring intermittent therapy; poor: unimproved or worse. Patients are divided into four categories, and the results are tabulated below (see Table 2). The best results are obtained in patients with acquired shortening due to esophagitis with and without stricture who have had no prior antireflux surgery and have no associated primary motor disorder. The proportion of unsatisfactory results is almost tripled (20% fair or poor) after reoperation after one or more failed antireflux procedures. When reflux esophagitis and stricture are associated with a primary motor disorder, only half of the patients have a good result sustained throughout long-term follow-up.\r"

After analyzing the symptoms at time of operation, 177 patients were separated by age at AV: newborns (1-14 days) 26, infants (2 weeks-1 year) 19, and children (greater than or equal to 1 year) 132. The newborn with critical AS typically presents with severe cardiac failure and the infant with moderate failure, whereas children may be asymptomatic. In the newborn group, final diagnosis has been made exclusively by noninvasive cardiac echogram since 1984. The presence of a hypoplastic left ventricle (HLV) and/or endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) are the most important determinants of mortality. Operative survival was 11 of 13 (85%) in the newborn group if HLV/EFE were not present. No operative deaths for AV occurred after 1965 in children. When present, a preoperative electrocardiographic strain pattern resolved in 80% of patients. Of 33 reoperations (21%), four were required 1.0 (0.5-2) years later for newborns, five were required for infants 7.2 (1.5-20) years later, and 24 were required in children 11.0 (1.5-25) years later. These included 10 repeat valvotomies and 23 aortic valve replacements (AVRs) with a 91% survival rate. In summary, although valves of patients with congenital AS are morphologically abnormal, valvotomy is beneficial. It was found that (1) the operative survival rate has been 100% over the past 20 years for children and currently is greater than 80% in newborns in the absence of HLV/EFE; (2) reoperation rate is higher in newborns and infants; (3) benefit was shown by a sharp decrease in obstruction initially and improved ECG later; (4) long-term follow-up revealed a subset of patients who are asymptomatic and have only mild residual obstruction over 20 years after AV.\r"

The combined operative morbidity rate for the pouch-anal anastomosis and the subsequent closure of the temporary ileostomy was 29% (bowel obstruction, 22%; pelvic sepsis, 5%), with one death due to pulmonary embolus. The probability of a successful outcome at 5 years was 94%. Of the 24 patients who failed (6% of total), 18 did so within 1 year (4%), three during year 2 (1%), three during year 3 (1%), and none thereafter. Stool frequency (7 stools/24 h), the occurrence of pouchitis (14%), and satisfactory daytime continence (94% of patients) remained stable over 4 years after operation, whereas nocturnal fecal spotting decreased (51% of patients to 20%). Women had more spotting than men, whereas patients over 50 years old had more stools per day than those 50 years or younger. In conclusion, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis achieved a reasonable stool frequency and satisfactory continence in patients with ulcerative colitis over the long-term. These results support the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis as a safe, satisfactory alternative to permanent ileostomy.\r"

Ninety-eight patients had failed chronic immunosuppressive therapy and three patients had acute intracranial bleeding or total absence of platelets in the peripheral blood smear, and had urgent splenectomy. At primary splenectomy, accessory spleens were identified and resected in 18% of patients. There was no operative mortality. Fifty-eight patients had an excellent response to splenectomy and their steroids were tapered off within 3 weeks. Thirteen patients had a poor response to primary splenectomy of whom eight remitted spontaneously and five required accessory splenectomy resulting in complete remission in three patients. Twenty-nine patients were considered nonresponders, 25 of whom had radionuclide scanning for accessory spleens. Seven of these patients had accessory spleens identified but only four consented to accessory splenectomy. In three of the four patients, a complete remission was achieved. Neither platelet antibody titers nor measurements of platelet survival or turnover predicted platelet response to splenectomy. However, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in older patients was significantly less likely to respond to splenectomy. These data support continuing use of splenectomy in selected patients with ITP and an aggressive search for accessory spleens in patients who relapse since they are easily localized at operation by hand-held isotope detector probe.\r"

Wounds were permitted to heal by secondary intention. All patients were maintained on intravenous hyperalimentation. Three of the 28 patients died (11%); none died of sepsis. Procedure-specific complications included: pancreatic fistula (10 patients), incisional hernia (8 patients), persistent functional gastric outlet obstruction (2 patients), retroperitoneal venous hemorrhage (2 patients), and intestinal fistula (1 patient). Limited initial experience with dynamic pancreatography and serial monitoring of acute phase reactants as indicators of pancreatic necrosis is promising. Compared with historic controls, open drainage of infected pancreatic necrosis represents a significant advance over more conventional surgical approaches. Controlled studies and more widespread experience are necessary for further evaluation of this procedure.\r"

From 1974 through 1984, 32 patients with marked impairment of pulmonary function had a limited resection for carcinoma of the lung. Marked impairment is defined as a maximum breathing capacity less than 35 to 40% of predicted, forced expiratory volume in one second less than or equal to 1 liter, and forced expiratory flow (FEV25-75) of less than or equal to 0.6 liter. Limited resection is defined as an operation that is less than a lobectomy, generally a wide wedge or segmental resection. The pathological stage of disease was Stage I in 31 patients and Stage II in 1 patient. Ten patients were treated by segmental resection and 22 by wide wedge resection. Two-year and three-year survival is 84 and 78%, respectively, and 10 patients (31%) have survived for five years. Recurrent disease developed in 8 patients, 5 of whom died. Recurrence was highest when the lesion crossed an intersegmental plane. In 1978, postoperative radiation therapy was added to the treatment of all patients whose lesion crossed an intersegmental plane. Since then, 18 patients have undergone wedge resection and postoperative irradiation with only 2 local recurrences at two years.\r"

Many have employed static pulmonary function testing in an attempt to decrease morbidity and mortality from lung resections. The purpose of the present study was to correlate preoperative static pulmonary function, one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), and exercise O2 consumption (MVO2) with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Fifty consecutive patients underwent preoperative FEV1 and MVO2 determinations. A criterion for surgical resection included an FEV1 greater than 1.7 liters for pneumonectomy, greater than 1.2 liters for lobectomy, and greater than 0.9 liters for wedge resection. The surgeon was blinded as to the results of MVO2 studies. Mean age was 63.8 years (range, 47 to 76 years). There were 10 pneumonectomies, 28 lobectomies, and 12 wedge resections. Among the 50 surgical candidates selected solely on the standard FEV1 values, mortality was 4% (2/50) and morbidity, 12% (6/50). Stratification on the basis of exercise performance showed a 29% mortality (2/7) and a 43% morbidity (3/7) in patients with an MVO2 less than 10 ml/kg/min. Patients with an MVO2 less than 20 but greater than 10 ml/kg/min had a 10.7% morbidity (3/28), and there were no deaths. No patients with an MVO2 greater than 20 ml/kg/min sustained any morbidity or died (p less than 0.001). We conclude that exercise is an important criterion in the preoperative evaluation of patients for pulmonary surgery. An MVO2 less than 10 ml/kg/min is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\r"

This study defines changes in global ventricular function, mass, and compliance during acute coronary occlusion and following reperfusion with blood in the beating and arrested heart. In 17 dogs on cardiopulmonary bypass, the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 45 minutes. In 12 dogs, flow was reestablished by releasing the coronary snare in the beating heart. In the other 5 dogs, the snare was released during a continuous 10-minute infusion of blood potassium cardioplegia in the arrested heart. Coronary occlusion resulted in significant decreases in stroke work index and left ventricular (LV) mass, but compliance was unchanged. Reperfusion in the beating heart increased LV mass compared with the values measured before ischemia (104 +/- 5 versus 95 +/- 5 gm; p less than 0.05) and decreased LV compliance (39 +/- 4 versus 53 +/- 4 ml at LV end-diastolic pressure of 8 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). In contrast, with blood cardioplegia-based reperfusion in the arrested heart, LV mass and LV compliance remained unchanged from control values. We conclude that revascularization of acutely ischemic myocardium in the beating heart further impairs LV function by increasing LV mass and decreasing compliance. This damage can be avoided by reperfusion with blood cardioplegia in the arrested heart.\r"

The resultant bronchopleural fistulas did not interfere with respiratory management despite the use of mechanical ventilation, and only 2 patients required subsequent surgical closure. Eleven patients were discharged from the hospital. Complications were minimal and consisted of 2 episodes of hemorrhage, 1 during operative debridement of the abscess and 1 delayed. Both complications were managed successfully. Three patients died in the hospital, only 1 from complications of the lung abscess. We have concluded from this review that tube drainage can be safe, simple, and efficacious.

These comprised flexible esophagoscopy (848), flexible esophagoscopy and dilation (924), pneumatic dilation (29), and rigid esophagoscopy (30). There were 14 episodes of perforation: 1 was cervical, 2 were abdominal, and 11 were perforations of the intrathoracic esophagus (7 occurred at or immediately above a stricture). The diagnosis was made immediately in 9 and within six hours in all but 1 patient. Treatment was emergency surgery in 12 patients, 2 of whom died. The major cause of death was respiratory failure. The overall incidence of perforation was 0.76%. The incidence of perforation was 0.35% (3/848) for flexible esophagoscopy alone, 0.38% (3/792) for dilation with Maloney mercury-weighted bougies, and 3.8% (5/132) for dilation with other bougies. Our experience indicates that instrumental perforation in benign esophageal disease carries a considerable mortality rate in spite of prompt recognition and surgical treatment. Successful dilation with mercury-weighted bougies can be achieved in 86% of benign strictures with an incidence of perforation similar to that for flexible esophagoscopy alone. Difficult strictures and the use of other bougies are associated with a tenfold higher incidence of perforation.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of surgical judgments in the management of thoracic lymphoma was studied through review of 34 patients with primary mediastinal lymphomas, 30 patients who needed one or more thoracic operations after treatment of extrathoracic lymphomas, and 5 patients with primary lymphocytic infiltrates (PLI) of the lung. In all patients with primary lymphocytic infiltrates of the lung, thoracotomies were required in order to establish the correct diagnosis. Patients with primary mediastinal lymphoma required 74 surgical procedures (2.2 per patient) to establish the correct diagnosis. In retrospect, 40 operations were not beneficial. The procedures that provided diagnostic samples were 15 anterior mediastinotomies, 8 full thoracotomies, 3 median sternotomies, and 8 lesser procedures such as mediastinoscopy. Patients who needed thoracic procedures after treatment of extrathoracic lymphomas had 41 thoracic operations (1.37 per patient). Five operations were needed to manage complications of thoracic lymphoma or its therapy. To evaluate new radiographic findings, there were 35 operations (1.3 per patient) at a mean interval of 5.0 years following initial treatment; the findings were recurrent lymphoma in 62% and new lesions in 38% of patients. Among new lesions, there were 2 bronchogenic cancers; 9 enlarging mediastinal-pleural masses were not caused by lymphoma. The accurate diagnosis of thoracic lymphoma or new thoracic lesions in patients with lymphomas usually requires enough tissue for immunophenotyping. Providing adequate tissue samples and treating new lesions that are not lymphomas often require major thoracomediastinotomies for immunophenotyping.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if operative palliation of idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS) is worthwhile in the elderly, hemodynamic, cardiac conduction, symptomatological, functional, and survival data were examined in 52 patients (39 women) 65 years old and older (mean age, 69 years; range, 65 to 81 years) who had a left ventricular myotomy and myectomy (LVMM) (Morrow procedure) alone or with concomitant operations. Seventy-four percent of all operative survivors underwent catheterization an average of 6 months postoperatively. The mean follow-up was 54 months (range, 5 to 120 months). The population was divided for analyses into those with coronary artery disease (CAD) (N = 11,21%) and those without (N = 41). The peak resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient was reduced from 65 +/- 16 mm Hg to 3 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) in the group with CAD and from 95 +/- 13 mm Hg to 17 +/- 9 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) in the group without CAD. Significant reductions in peak gradients in response to provocation also occurred in both groups. New conduction abnormalities occurred in 72% of survivors, 85% of whom showed improvement in regard to symptoms. The overall average New York Heart Association Functional Class was 3.2 +/- 0.1 preoperatively and at latest follow-up, 1.9 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.001). The hospital mortality for LVMM alone in the absence of CAD was 8% with a 5-year actuarial survival of 75 +/- 8%. LVMM in the presence of CAD resulted in an operative mortality of 27% (N = 3); all deaths were related to an acquired ventricular septal defect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In both, the left latissimus dorsi (LD) muscle was used in the repair of the ventricular aneurysm because preoperative studies demonstrated that there was concomitant coronary artery disease, and there was a strong suggestion that resection of the entire aneurysm would seriously compromise the residual ventricular capacity. One patient had an 18-year history of coronary occlusion with two infarctions. A large, calcified ventricular aneurysm developed, and despite vigorous medical treatment, intractable congestive heart failure and angina persisted. The diffuse coronary artery disease made this patient a poor candidate for bypass grafting. The other patient sustained an acute myocardial infarction 5 months prior to operation. The left anterior descending coronary artery was totally occluded, and a large apical aneurysm developed along with an akinetic anterior wall and septum. After his heart attack, the patient had progressive dyspnea on exertion. Following operation in both patients, the transpositioned LD, then a component in the repair of the left ventricular wall, was electrically trained to synchronously contract with each systole, driven by a standard dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker. Steady improvement and a return to normal activities were observed in both patients. There was an indication of improved ejection fraction with synchronous contraction of the skeletal muscle.\r"

The aortic valve was resuspended in 6 patients. The single operative death was unrelated to the method of repair. Two late deaths at 4 and 6 years were due to preexisting multisystem disease. In 1 patient, new aortic insufficiency with an isolated aneurysm of the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva developed at 26 months, and was repaired successfully at another institution. These results compare favorably with those reported by others employing more extensive surgical procedures for repair of acute ascending aortic dissection.\r"

A porcine valve was used in 104 patients, a St. Jude Medical valve in 40, and a Bjork-Shiley valve in 18. The valve replaced was the aortic in 25 patients, the mitral (systemic atrioventricular [AV] valve) in 43, the pulmonary in 71, and the tricuspid (pulmonary AV valve) in 23. Hospital mortality was 6%. Patients with a Bjork-Shiley valve received warfarin sodium anticoagulation, and those with a St. Jude Medical valve were given salicylates and dipyridamole. Follow-up is available on all patients 0.6 to 12 years postoperatively (mean, 6.3 +/- 2.6 years). New York Heart Association Functional Class improved in 62% and remained unchanged in 38% of the patients. Thromboembolic complications occurred in only 8 (57%) of 14 patients with a St. Jude Medical valve in the right (pulmonary) side and in 3 (12%) of 26 with the valve in the left (systemic) side of the circulation. Bacterial endocarditis developed in 3 patients, all with porcine valves. Early valve replacement, less than 2 years after detection of hemodynamic deterioration, resulted in improvement in the ventricular ejection fraction in 25 of 29 patients (from 81 +/- 14% to 90 +/- 12% of normal; p less than 0.05). In contrast, the ejection fraction remained abnormal in all 22 patients with delayed valve insertion (more than 2 years) (81 +/- 16% of normal preoperatively and 80 +/- 10% of normal following operation; p = not significant).\r"

  ".W": "Some surgeons advocate early correction of dextrotransposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) using hypothermic circulatory arrest when Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy is inadequate. An alternative procedure is a Blalock-Hanlon closed atrial septectomy. From 1971 to 1985, 19 patients underwent the latter procedure for D-TGA at our institution. Three had it as the first procedure, and 16 had undergone Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy, which was unsuccessful. Age at performance of the Blalock-Hanlon closed atrial septectomy ranged from 1 day to 5 months (mean, 2.51 months). There were no operative deaths. Subsequently, 18 children have had a Mustard procedure, and 1, a Rastelli procedure (average age at definitive repair, 25.31 months). One death followed definitive repair (combined mortality, 5%). On room air, average partial pressure of arterial oxygen rose from 23.25 mm Hg prior to closed atrial septectomy to 31.45 mm Hg at discharge. Average hematocrit fell from 58.37% prior to closed atrial septectomy to 53.94% prior to definitive repair. At the time of definitive repair, percentile height ranged from the 3rd to the 95th percentile (mean, 44th percentile) and weight ranged from the 3rd to the 90th percentile (mean, 32.5th percentile). In 1 infant, transient neurological symptoms developed three days following Blalock-Hanlon atrial septectomy. The symptoms were due to multiple cerebral infarctions thought to be caused by emboli. No permanent neurological deficit resulted. We believe that the infant with an inadequate Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy prior to age 6 months should undergo a Blalock-Hanlon septectomy followed by definitive repair timed on the basis of the baby's growth, associated anomalies, and evidence of pulmonary hypertension.\r"

The number of patients who had discontinued drug treatment was significantly greater in the malignant group (19; 49%) than in the benign group (11; 28%). Insufficient sleep, overwork, and/or mental burden of long duration were factors noticed within one year before the occurrence of the malignant phase in 11 (37%) of the 30 patients in that group in whom this information was available. Patients in the malignant group tended to belong to a lower social class. These results suggest that severe hypertension from an early phase, interruption of drug treatment, and physical and/or mental burden may predispose to the development of malignant hypertension, and that these predisposing factors are likely to be associated with social class.\r"

There was clinical evidence of proximal muscle weakness, and a muscle biopsy specimen was consistent with myopathy. The reduction in ventilatory drive, however, could not be explained solely by ventilatory muscle weakness. This report describes a distinct familial syndrome of congenital myopathy and abnormal ventilatory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia. All affected family members had unique facial features, proximal muscle weakness, and impaired ventilatory responses. The combination of impaired ventilatory drive and reduced ventilatory muscle strength leaves patients particularly vulnerable, and heightened awareness of this association is important in the treatment of these patients.\r"

Since the serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentration is elevated in hyperthyroidism, this study was carried out to evaluate the serum SHBG concentration as a possible marker of hyperthyroidism in patients receiving amiodarone. Patients treated with amiodarone were divided into three groups: clinically euthyroid with normal serum T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations, clinically euthyroid with elevated serum T4 and normal T3 concentrations, and clinically hyperthyroid with elevated serum T4 and T3 concentrations. The mean serum SHBG concentration was significantly elevated in amiodarone-induced hyperthyroid patients, while it was normal in euthyroid patients treated with amiodarone who had normal or elevated serum T4 concentrations. The results suggest that the hyperthyroxinemia induced by amiodarone is not associated with excess thyroid hormone action in the liver unless the serum T3 concentration is also elevated.\r"

On the basis of a comprehensive chart review, 24 patients were categorized as having disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), 84 were considered not to have had DIC, ten had fibrinolysis (nine of ten streptokinase induced), and five had a complicated coagulopathy whose exact nature could not be determined. The quantitative and semiquantitative FDP values were significantly correlated. However, the FDP level indicative of DIC was lower by the quantitative assay than by the semiquantitative assay, approximately 18 mg/L vs 40 mg/L, respectively. The advantages of the quantitative over the semiquantitative assay included improved precision and ability to closely monitor changes in the severity of the coagulopathy.\r"

The major drawback to indiscriminate folate therapy is the potential of masking findings of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency. This has been dismissed as a problem in sickle cell anemia because of the generally young age of the patients. However, because young blacks, especially women, are at higher risk for developing pernicious anemia than whites, sickle cell anemia and pernicious anemia can be expected to coexist occasionally. In this article we describe such a patient and recommend that routine folate supplementation should not be given in sickle cell anemia before determining the vitamin B12 status.\r"

The rapid clearance of theophylline due to the administration of oral activated charcoal was believed to be a contributing factor. It is likely that theophylline-induced hypokalemia is due to intracellular sequestration of potassium and that as the theophylline level decreases potassium will reequilibrate out of the cell. The case provides support for the conservative management of metabolite abnormalities associated with theophylline overdose.\r"

The major findings were an increased overall prevalence of major depression and substance abuse, psychiatric treatment, poor social functioning, and school problems in the children of depressed proband parents compared with children of normal proband parents. Overall prepubertal depression was uncommon and the sex ratios were equal. After 12 years of age, there was an increasing preponderance of female subjects in the group with major depression. The mean age at onset of major depression was similar for male and female subjects. However, it was significantly earlier in the children of depressed probands (mean age at onset, 12 to 13 years) compared with the children of normal probands (mean age at onset, 16 to 17 years). Symptom profiles and additional types of diagnoses in the depressed children from either proband parent group did not differ. These children are being followed up longitudinally to determine the prognostic significance, persistence, recurrence, and recall of their symptoms. Several research and clinical strategies are suggested by these data.\r"

There were no significant differences between the two groups in the majority of depressive symptoms. However, prepubertal children had greater depressed appearance, somatic complaints, psychomotor agitation, separation anxiety, phobias, and hallucinations, whereas adolescents had greater anhedonia, hopelessness, hypersomnia, weight change, use of alcohol and illicit drugs, and lethality of suicide attempt, but not severity of suicidal ideation or intent. Adolescents with a duration of the depressive episode of two years or greater had significantly higher rates of suicidal ideation and intent, lethality, and number of suicide attempts than youngsters with depressive episodes of shorter duration. A principal components factor analysis of psychiatric symptoms was carried out in all 296 youngsters evaluated during the same period who met DSM-III criteria for any Axis I diagnosis. The majority had an affective disorder. Factors were quite similar for both adolescents and children and included an \"endogenous\" and an \"anxious\" factor, as in many studies of adult depression. In addition, three other factors were found: negative cognitions, appetite and weight changes, and a conduct factor. Suicidal ideation was a component of both the negative cognitions factor and the conduct factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We looked for similarities in clinical features and concordance of diagnosis within sibships to test for shared familial causes. Clinical variables, including diagnosis, specific symptoms, age at onset, and nongenetic perinatal factors, were studied. Auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, thought disorder, negative symptoms, and poor premorbid social adjustment did not significantly correlate in siblings. Concordance was found for schizoaffective disorder and history of major depressive episodes, suggesting that schizophrenia with a depressive component and Research Diagnostic Criteria schizoaffective illness may represent a specific etiologic subtype(s) of the illness, whereas the other noted symptoms may represent the variable expression of the disorder. Age at onset and at first hospitalization were significantly correlated, consistent with genetic or other familial factors on time of onset. Birth complications were significantly more frequent among the schizophrenic compared with non-psychotic siblings, had a familial component, and tended to be associated with an earlier age at onset. Thus, nongenetic perinatal factors may increase the risk for schizophrenia in a familial form of the illness and contribute to the correlation of ages at onset in siblings.\r"

Outcome measures of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study included changes in behavior, plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG) level, blood pressure, and heart rate. A subgroup of six patients experienced a notable dysphoric arousal reaction that occurred 60 to 90 minutes following administration of 20 mg of yohimbine, this reaction was not observed in healthy subjects. The schizophrenic group as a whole (not the subgroup) showed a statistical trend toward a greater yohimbine-induced increase in plasma MHPG level and systolic sitting blood pressure. The patients with TD did not differ from those without TD or from healthy controls in their response to yohimbine. These results do not support the hypothesis that noradrenergic dysfunction plays a strong central role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia or TD. However, further studies of noradrenergic dysfunction in sub-groups of patients with schizophrenia are indicated.\r"

In this study of 88 chronic schizophrenic inpatients, 22 variables (four demographic, 14 medication history, and four features of illness) were compared for any association(s) with the presence, by differing topographies and criteria of abnormality, and severity of involuntary movements. Irrespective of the criterion used, the presence of marked cognitive dysfunction-muteness bore a consistent and highly significant primary association with both the presence and the overall severity of orofacial dyskinesia; no such association was found in relation to the presence of limb-truncal dyskinesia. Flattening of affect was the only other variable consistently associated with the presence of orofacial movements. The reliability and prominence of the association between the presence of orofacial, but not of limb-truncal, movements and cognitive dysfunction-negative symptoms suggest that these varying topographies may not constitute a unitary syndrome. This strong association, not with indexes of neuroleptic exposure but rather with features of the illness for which that treatment was prescribed, suggests some neurologic process, more subtle than may previously have been appreciated, as a vulnerability factor of some importance. In schizophrenia it appears to be intimately related to the disease process.\r"

Directors of 271 Great Lakes Region laboratories reported the causes of and the corrective actions taken for 583 targeted results over a two-year period. Targetting of results in 31% was attributed to methodologic or instrumentation problems, 19% to technical performance factors, and 27% to clerical errors. Only 3% were ascribed to the Survey materials or to the criteria used for grading, and 20% of the problems remained unexplained after investigation.

These patterns of reaction could be correlated with infectious agents. Disseminated opportunistic infections involved the spleen in 27 cases; of these, the red pulp had a histiocytic or mixed pattern in 89%, and the white pulp showed lymphoid depletion in 52%. Other lesions, including neoplasms in five patients, did not predominate in any group. Splenic opportunistic infections in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome may correlate with histologic patterns of reaction and give an indication of immune response.\r"

Regular metaplasias showed an increased stain with AE3; all layers of the surface epithelium were stained. The dysplastic and neoplastic lesions exhibited an extraordinary increase in the staining patterns with AE3 and to a lesser extent with AE1. Involucrin, which was absent from the normal pseudostratified epithelium, appeared in all metaplastic-dysplastic lesions and in keratinized areas of carcinomas. The combined detection of keratins and involucrin proved useful in detecting the degree of maturity and differentiation of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of the nasal mucosa.\r"

Three lots (n = 12-16) of young adult male (body weight of 275 to 325 g), Sprague-Dawley rats were used. One lot of 16 animals was kept as normal, while the other two underwent bilateral L4 or L5 spinal nerve sectioning. Six to seven animals each from the normal, L4-, and L5 neurectomized animals underwent bilateral synergistic tenotomy of the soleus so that the soleus was retained as the sole plantar-flexor of the ankle joint. The remaining animals were kept as normal or neurectomized control groups. Thus, the six groups studied were normal control (n = 9); normal synergistically tenotomized (n = 7); L4 neurectomized control (n = 8); L4 neurectomized and synergistically tenotomized (n = 6); L5 neurectomized control (n = 8); and L5 neurectomized and synergistically tenotomized (n = 7). Seven days after surgery, the soleus muscles were used to evaluate the muscle weights. The soleus nerves were evaluated for the number plus areas of the LMA by computerized planimetric procedures. The data revealed a 13.9% (p less than 0.05) increase in areas of the LMA in the L5 neurectomized control group; whereas the L5 neurectomized and synergistically tenotomized group showed a 39.6% (p less than 0.01) increase in areas of the LMA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Temperatures of 44.0 +/- 2.8C, 36.1 +/- 3.8C, 39.6 +/- 2.3C, and 35.2 +/- 1.5C were measured after heating in the joint cavity, cartilage, muscle, and skin, respectively. The only significant increase in the temperature was recorded in the heated joint cavity (p less than 0.01). This new microwave device can be a therapeutic tool in treating joint diseases because of its advantage of heating the target organ only, eg, synovium, while sparing the adjacent tissues.\r"

Significant variations were noted in pressure distribution between the two sockets, but the magnitudes of the pressures in well-fitting sockets of both types were similar. Thus, magnitude of pressure in an above-knee socket may provide a more useful guide than distribution for predicting the fit of an appliance.\r"

The relative contribution of limbs and aids in these functions was quantified in three patient groups: those with postoperative total hip replacement (THR), tibial fracture, and paraplegia. Aid forces were recorded and resolved into three components. Floor-to-foot forces were measured anterior-posteriorly and vertically. Results were interpreted by temporal relationships between aids and limb, symmetry of restraining/propelling forces, and peak forces during limb and aid loading phases. Impulse values (area under the force-time curve), presented as histograms, readily demonstrated the contribution of aids and limbs to locomotion. Results showed (1) variability in aid loadings among THR subjects, and between ipsilateral and contralateral sticks; (2) symmetrical restraining and propelling aid loadings of fracture subjects; and (3) that aid impulses directed medially were greater than the combined anterior-posterior direction amounts in four of seven subjects performing three-point gait. It is suggested that this technique of quantifying aid usage by impulse histograms be used to evaluate and prescription and sizing, gait training, and crutch design.\r"

The correlations between the performance-based ADL and the interview-based ADL were r greater than .97 for the total score and r greater than .85 for most of the individual items. The modified Barthel Index of the ADL is a reliable measure for assessing stable stroke patients, supporting its use in multicenter studies.

Examining subjects with left- and right-side involvement separately using stepwise multiple regression, psychologic tests were able to account for 55% and 42%, respectively, of the variance in discharge outcome, as measured by the Barthel Index. Accounting for variance associated with change in Barthel Index score during rehabilitation proved more difficult, with R2 values of 0.14 and 0.07, respectively.

Prolonged observation, while safe, is expensive and potentially morbid in the event that a retroperitoneal injury has occurred and treatment is delayed. To evaluate these injuries, we have developed and employed a protocol for computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the abdomen employing oral, intravenous, and rectal administration of contrast material to visualize the retroperitoneal contents. Between Jan 1, 1985, and Dec 1, 1986, 40 patients were studied in this manner. In each case, the path of penetration could be determined exactly by tracing the course of air and hematoma through the tissues. All retroperitoneal organs could be evaluated well enough to exclude injuries requiring intervention. The majority of patients showed subcutaneous penetrations only. All six significant intra-abdominal injuries were diagnosed correctly and confirmed at laparotomy. All 34 patients deemed by CT not to have significant injury were observed for 72 hours, and all were discharged uneventfully. Triple-contrast CT appears to be of great value in the triage of penetrating posterior abdominal trauma into operative and nonoperative groups.\r"

Transit times in ileal segments longitudinally incised and closed and control segments were 49% and 63%, respectively. The mean reservoir volume three months after operation was 53 mL for LR, 101 mL for JR, 20 mL for longitudinally incised and closed ileal segments, and 25 mL for control segments. Although reservoir function between the LR and JR may be similar at six to nine months postoperatively, it appears that the JR empties more slowly and becomes more distended during the first three months after construction in the rabbit model studied.\r"

Thus, the problems of single and multiple organ system failure in China are similar to those in other countries.\r"

Late follow-up arteriograms (66 studies) after a mean two-year interval revealed three instances (4.5%) of recurrent asymptomatic stenosis. Four patients (6%) developed late occlusions; three were asymptomatic and one was associated with major stroke 2 1/2 years later. One patient (1.5%) developed a false aneurysm. One patient experienced a postoperative transient ischemic attack. There was no operative mortality. Six patients died in the late follow-up period. The venous patch graft ensured immediate patency of the internal carotid artery but failed to prevent recurrent stenosis or occlusion in internal carotid arteries less than 3.0 mm in diameter.\r"

The present study was designed to determine whether free radical-induced membrane damage is involved in the pathogenesis of decreased muscle amino acid uptake, noted in sepsis. Additionally, the effect on survival rate of SOD given after the onset of sepsis was studied. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture in rats. Amino acid transport in incubated soleus muscles was studied using tritiated alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. Amino acid uptake was significantly reduced in muscle from rats with sepsis. Administration of SOD before induction of sepsis or added in vitro to incubated muscles with sepsis had no effect on alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake. Survival rate was not increased when SOD was given two hours after cecal ligation and puncture. The results suggest that free radical-induced membrane damage is not the mechanism of inhibited muscle amino acid transport in sepsis. Since survival was not improved by SOD administered after induction of sepsis, the role of the enzyme in the treatment of sepsis may be questioned.\r"

For those patients who did not initially undergo an elective lymph node dissection, the majority of first recurrences were at regional lymph nodes. Attempts have been made to identify those patients at risk of relapsing. Axial lesions, particularly those on the scalp, had the highest recurrence rate, with 15% of all thin scalp lesions recurring compared with only 4% of all thin extremity lesions. Three histological features proved to be useful prognostic indicators when analyzed by single-factor analysis. Evidence of ulceration in the primary lesion increased the recurrence rate from 6.7% to 26.1%. While only 4.3% of lesions displaying low mitotic activity recurred, this rate rose to 23.8% for those lesions of a high mitotic grade. Only 5% of Clark's level II lesions recurred, compared with about 12% of lesions at either level III or IV. Evidence of regression in thin lesions had no deleterious effect on prognosis. This study defines a small subset of patients who may benefit from elective lymph node dissection.\r"

We suggest that in the partition of energy costs between host and tumor, both carry a similar input, proportional to their relative weight, into the total combined resting energy expenditure of host and tumor.\r"

We identified those factors that correlate with an increased incidence of post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension. The records of 100 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy at UCLA Medical Center from November 1981 to September 1983 were examined. One hundred fifty variables were surveyed to determine those factors associated with this problem. Fifty-eight percent of the study patients developed post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension (an increase in systolic blood pressure greater than 35 mm Hg over baseline, and/or blood pressure requiring treatment with sodium nitroprusside). Of patients who developed this problem, 93% had diabetes mellitus, 75% received isoflurane anesthesia, 71% had peripheral vascular occlusive disease, 71% underwent ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks, and 65% had high-grade ipsilateral carotid stenosis. These variables have in common the loss of or interference with cerebral autoregulation. Central dysautoregulation may set the stage for a positive feedback mechanism that results in increased blood pressure. Anesthetic agents that do not interfere with cerebral autoregulation may reduce the incidence of this complication, and an aggressive treatment program may prevent neurologic complications.\r"

The severity of mucosal damage was assessed using the following indicators of mucosal integrity: transmucosal potential difference, net flux of sodium, and mucosal permeability to erythritol labeled with carbon 14, a neutral molecule with a greatest molecular diameter of 8.2 nm. Furthermore, the morphologic characteristics of esophageal damage were studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. The results suggest that lipase significantly decreased transmucosal potential difference and increased mucosal permeability to sodium and erythritol labeled with carbon 14. Morphologically, lipase induced cytoplasmatic vesiculation and widening of intercellular spaces within the basal cell layer. The epithelial cell layers were also often seen to be sloughed off with consequent exposure of the subepithelial connective tissue at the mucosal surface. The findings suggest that lipase has an adverse effect on the esophageal mucosa that may have pathogenetic significance in clinical reflux esophagitis.\r"

In the ultrasonic dissector group, there was an increase in postoperative white blood cell count and liver enzyme levels compared with the other two groups. Light microscopy revealed dilated bile ducts in the ultrasonic dissector resection group, which may reflect biliary stasis. There were no significant differences in mortality among the three experimental groups. Results indicated that the ultrasonic dissector and the contact laser method were not substantially better than an inexpensive, easily modified plastic suction catheter in performing a major nonanatomic liver resection in piglets.\r"

The present report reviews 15 patients who underwent splenectomy for IDTP, demonstrates the successful use of surgical therapy, and defines our indications for splenectomy in the treatment of this disorder. Thirteen of 15 patients had initially failed to respond to steroid therapy. Fourteen patients (93%) initially responded to splenectomy, with platelet counts increasing to 150 X 10(9)/L (150,000/mm3) or greater. A continuing complete response was achieved in nine patients (60%) following splenectomy. After postsurgical adjunctive therapy, durable remission was achieved in 73% (11/15) of the patients. Complications occurred in three patients, and there were no deaths. The mean follow-up was 12.4 months. Splenectomy may be performed in the treatment of IDTP with acceptable morbidity and likelihood of response.\r"

We surgically treated two such patients in whom conditions did not allow for conservative medical management, ie, the packets caused small-bowel obstruction in one patient while toxic manifestations of cocaine occurred in the other patient. Initial emergent surgical treatment vs success with conservative medical management appears to be directly related to whether a patient voluntarily receives treatment or is involuntarily brought to the hospital on suspicion of smuggling cocaine packet ingestion. Early surgical intervention is warranted unless the method of packet construction is known to be of high quality and if the patient is totally asymptomatic. If these criteria are present, intensive care monitoring, with surgical intervention on any change in status, is preferred.\r"

Blood-aqueous and blood-retinal barrier functions were determined by aqueous and vitreous fluorophotometry before and 1, 2, 3, and 7 months after initiation of treatment. Epinephrine-induced disruption of the blood-aqueous barrier, noted at two months, apparently remained constant until the completion of the study. At months 2, 3, and 7, indomethacin significantly inhibited this disruption. The blood-retinal barrier was unaffected. These results bear on the hypotensive mechanism of topically applied epinephrine.\r"

Mean pupillary dilation at 60 minutes was equivalent (4.86 mm vs 4.57 mm) for both eyes, respectively. The plasma phenylephrine level was determined for the two drop sizes in a second group of infants. Eight infants received an 8-microL drop volume in both eyes, while nine infants received a 30-microL drop volume in both eyes. The mean phenylephrine level at ten minutes was 0.9 ng/mL for the 8-microL drop group and 1.9 ng/mL for the 30 microL drop group. In neonates and infants, reducing the drop volume of topical phenylephrine may improve the risk-benefit ratio.\r"

Astigmatism greater than +1.25 diopters (as high as +5.50 diopters) was most commonly associated with dacryoceles (eight of 12 eyes) and with hemangiomas (14 of 17 eyes). Plus cylinder axes were consistently oriented toward the lesion, and astigmatism tended to resolve with resolution of the lesions. Only one of the 17 eyes with dermoids and two of the 23 eyes with chalazions had astigmatism. Anisometropic amblyopia has been a prominent concern in the treatment of infants with hemangiomas. Patients with dacryoceles may be at similar risk. Repeated cycloplegic refractions are important in determining appropriate treatment of adnexal masses.\r"

Only two children had normal scans of the posterior visual pathway and both had favorable visual outcomes. The visual recovery differed significantly with respect to the age at which the hypoxic insult occurred and CT and MRI abnormalities in the area of the optic radiations, but not with abnormalities in the striate or parastriate cortices. Our results suggest that CT and MRI scanning are helpful in prognosticating the visual potential of children with hypoxic cortical blindness.\r"

If cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation are subsequently performed, significant refractive errors result with most IOL styles if standard formulas are used to determine lens power. Thick-lens optical analysis of four IOL styles showed that the meniscus style yields the smallest difference between predicted (Binkhorst, Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff formulas) and actual postoperative refraction. This IOL style also minimizes the change in refractive error that accompanies subsequent alterations in the contents of the vitreous cavity, including removal of silicone oil and replacement with balanced salt solution.\r"

Peripheral blood lymphocytes from the patient's mother, who had an acquired seizure disorder, demonstrated vacuolated lymphocytes with membranous formations and osmophilic granular bodies, as revealed by electron microscopy. Examination of peripheral blood lymphocytes can be a sensitive diagnostic test in suspected neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and may be useful in identifying carriers or family members in the early clinical stages of the disease.\r"

The patient, a 38-year-old woman, had been asymptomatic when an enlarged right lacrimal gland was detected. Histologically, the tumor was composed primarily of oxyphilic cells but focally exhibited characteristics diagnostic of MEC. To our knowledge, only two oxyphilic variants of MEC have been reported, and occurrence in the lacrimal gland has not previously been documented. The existence of this lesion is significant because it shares histologic features with oxyphilic adenoma (oncocytoma), a more common and less aggressive neoplasm of the orbit.\r"

Eight topical preparations of aminocaproic acid were studied to determine aqueous humor concentrations. The vehicles studied included the following: sodium chloride, 0.85 g/dL; polyvinyl alcohol, 1.4 g/dL; hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, 0.4 g/dL; benzalkonium chloride, 0.01 g/dL; ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium, 0.01 g/dL; dimethyl sulfoxide, 11 and 39.6 g/dL; and carboxypolymethylene, 4 g/dL. All contained 735 g/L of aminocaproic acid except for dimethyl sulfoxide (39.6 g/dL) and carboxypolymethylene (4 g/dL), which contained 238 and 600 g/L of aminocaproic acid, respectively. Aqueous humor and plasma samples were assayed for aminocaproic acid content following topical administration. Aqueous humor concentrations of aminocaproic acid ranged from undetectable (less than 0.01 mg/dL) to 5.75 mg/dL. Plasma concentrations ranged from undetectable (less than 0.01 mg/dL) to 9.85 mg/dL. Polyvinyl alcohol (1.4 g/dL) and carboxy polymethylene (4 g/dL) provided the highest aqueous humor aminocaproic acid concentrations. The aqueous humor levels with topical aminocaproic acid administration were comparable with those achieved by systemic administration. Plasma drug levels with topical aminocaproic acid were between 5% and 33% of levels achieved by systemic aminocaproic acid. This study demonstrates that aminocaproic acid can be effectively delivered into the anterior chamber of rabbits by topical application.\r"

These effects of MSM were found to be dependent upon the concentrations of drug not bound to albumin (free drug), and were caused by its ability to interfere at both a receptor and post-receptor (i.e., a step distal to mobilization of polymorphonuclear leukocyte intracellular Ca2+) level. These unique actions of MSM may provide a partial explanation for its potent antiinflammatory effect.\r"

In addition to a physical history and examination and laboratory evaluation, a biopsy of the skin and deep subcutaneous tissue of the patient's left thigh was performed, and this revealed occlusion of 2 large dermal blood vessels by a highly organized thrombus. A regimen of nifedipine and antiplatelet therapy, plus complete abstinence from tobacco, resulted in resolution of the patient's symptoms and pain. Our findings may be of particular importance in view of the increasing popularity of smokeless tobacco and the complications which may result from its use.\r"

This receptor is involved in the processing of immune complexes. Whether the deficiency is inherited or acquired has been the subject of controversy. A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), identified using a complementary DNA probe for CR1, has been correlated with the numeric expression of CR1 on normal erythrocytes. The gene frequency for the 2 alleles defined by this RFLP was compared in 44 patients with SLE (from 42 families), 43 of their consanguineous relatives, and 50 nonrelated normal subjects. The gene frequency for the alleles correlating with high and low expression of CR1 was 0.73 and 0.27, respectively, in the normal subjects. The gene frequency was not significantly different in the SLE patients. However, the SLE patients expressed fewer CR1 molecules per erythrocyte within each genotype, compared with normal subjects and compared with their consanguineous relatives. The low allele for numeric expression of CR1 on erythrocytes is not a disease susceptibility gene for SLE.\r"

These values differed significantly (P less than 0.001) from those in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy, and chronic HLA-B27-associated arthropathy. Rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving low-dose prednisolone treatment had higher synovial fluid (P = 0.006) and serum (P less than 0.001) proteoglycan concentrations than did those taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or slow-acting antirheumatic drugs. Serum proteoglycan concentrations were near the detection limits, and did not correlate with levels found in paired samples of knee joint synovial fluid. Patients with calcium pyrophosphate arthropathy had the highest mean serum level of proteoglycan. This assay of proteoglycan antigens is a useful tool in the study of proteoglycan metabolism in patients with joint disease. With its use, differences between disease groups and effects of therapy can be distinguished.\r"

The mean neutrophil chemotaxis to both leukotriene B4 and FMLP significantly increased toward the normal range at week 6. The generation of 5-lipoxygenase products by calcium ionophore-stimulated monocytes was not significantly suppressed, but a significant decline (37%) in platelet-activating factor generation was noted at week 6. The modulation of these measures of leukocyte inflammatory potential suggests that fish oil supplementation may have an antiinflammatory effect.\r"

The total number of patients requiring an IV infusion drip (either by paramedics or in the emergency department of the receiving hospital) was 20 (20%). If all 102 patients had received conventional IV drip infusions, the total patient equipment charges would have been $4,610.40. The actual charges for all patients in this series, either with heparin locks or IV infusion sets, was $1,846.14--a 60% savings. The results of the study indicate that the heparin lock is a safe, convenient, and cost-effective method for maintaining IV access in the prehospital environment.\r"

This finding is in contrast to those of earlier studies, which consistently demonstrated a beneficial effect. The current study evaluated naloxone's ability to improve hemodynamics when administered following a fixed-volume hemorrhage, during a period of partial hemodynamic compensation. Thirteen conditioned beagles were anesthetized with pentobarbital (25 mg/kg intravenously), endotracheally intubated, and instrumented with a femoral arterial line and a pulmonary artery thermodilution catheter. Animals were then subjected to an estimated 50% graded hemorrhage (45 ml/kg) over one hour. Following hemorrhage, animals were observed for 90 minutes, then reinfused with shed blood over 30 minutes, and finally observed for an additional 60 minutes. Six animals received naloxone (2 mg/kg intravenously) 30 minutes after completion of hemorrhage and then 2 mg/kg/hr for the duration of the study. Seven control animals received an equivalent volume of saline. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac output, arterial and mixed venous blood gases, and serum lactate level were measured at regular intervals throughout the study. Cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance index were calculated at the same intervals. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean data values for mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, or lactate, although lactate values were consistently higher in the naloxone group (two-tailed independent Student's t test). We conclude that naloxone does not significantly improve hemodynamics when administered after a fixed-volume hemorrhage.\r"

A number of studies have attempted to clarify this question without complete success. This study was designed to evaluate the difference in serum levels of NAC when given with activated charcoal. Nineteen patients completed a two-phase cross-over study in which they served as their own controls. Each subject in phase 1 received 140 mg/kg of diluted, chilled NAC orally, and venous blood samples were drawn for analysis. Phase 2 consisted of a 100-g dose of activated charcoal followed by NAC. Samples were transported immediately and assayed using spectrophotometry. A reduction in peak NAC level of 29% (P less than .02) and a reduction of total area under the curve (AUC) of 39% (P less than .001) was noted. Although it may be preferable to avoid completely the use of activated charcoal when using NAC to treat overdoses of acetaminophen, we recommend that if these agents are used together, doses of NAC be increased by 40% to compensate for the decreased oral absorption of NAC.\r"

Of those women meeting the criteria, 93% (54/58) obtained relief of their symptoms by treatment with metronidazole. Of those women not meeting the criteria, only 24% (10/42) were cured (P less than .001). The sensitivity, specificity, and total error rates of these criteria were 84, 89, and 14%, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Lumbar puncture is an emergency department procedure for evaluating patients with suspected central nervous system infection or hemorrhage. To determine whether extensive testing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from emergency department patients was useful, charts of 104 adult patients who underwent lumbar puncture in a university hospital emergency department were reviewed. Examination of the CSF disclosed pleocytosis in 25 (24%) of the patients; the presence of red blood cells was considered to be clinically significant in two patients. An abnormal level of CSF protein was present in 62% of patients, and abnormal levels of glucose in 32%. Fungal element testing was negative each of the 72 times it was performed; Gram stain disclosed a bacterial pathogen in one patient. Cultures for fungus and tuberculosis were uniformly negative, as were all immunologic tests. Bacterial cultures grew a pathogen in one patient. No patient with a normal neurologic examination and normal initial CSF analysis was diagnosed subsequently as having acute central nervous system disease. The preponderance of negative or normal results of testing of CSF suggests that extensive testing may not be necessary for all patients. Limitation of sophisticated testing to only those samples with abnormal cell counts or chemistries or from patients at high risk should result in substantial cost saving without compromising patient care.\r"

The patient initially was thought to have suffered a cardiovascular accident but was discovered to have taken an overdose of flurazepam hydrochloride. Depression is a common and under-recognized problem in the geriatric population. As a consequence, suicide rates are highest in the elderly. Over- and underdosing of both prescription and nonprescription drugs are common means available to the suicidal elderly patient. These overdoses are often attributed to unintentional patient errors and overlooked for what they are, attempted suicides, or they are missed entirely as a cause of the patient's presentation. This case illustrates the need to consider drug overdose in the obtunded elderly patient.\r"

After the diagnosis is made, management depends on the clinical presentation and serum lithium level. Hemodialysis is the treatment of choice for severe lithium intoxication. Two cases of lithium intoxication are presented that demonstrate that predisposing factors and drug interactions play major roles. A review is given of the pathophysiology, presenting signs, symptoms, and approaches to treatment of lithium intoxication.\r"

This warning signal provides the physician with a brief interval in which to hemodynamically stabilize a patient, electively occlude the carotid, and consequently improve the patient's chance of survival. For three years, we have employed an initial nonoperative approach to patients with impending carotid rupture. A trial of endovascular balloon occlusion followed by detachable balloon embolization of the carotid artery has been utilized. Patients unable to tolerate temporary occlusion underwent a vascular bypass procedure followed by embolization. Six patients have undergone this approach, and all had permanent cessation of bleeding. None died as a result of the procedures. One patient developed permanent neurologic deficits. Balloon embolization offers improved results over elective ligation and should be considered as an alternative treatment for patients in this dire predicament.\r"

  ".W": "Rhodamine 123 (Rh 123), a mitochondrial-specific dye with an absorption maxima at 511 nm, was tested as a new chemosensitizing agent for argon laser treatment of P3 human squamous carcinoma cells. After exposure of P3 cells in vitro to Rh 123 at doses of 1, 3, 6, and 10 micrograms/mL for one hour, we observed significant inhibition of DNA synthesis, except at the lowest dose. Rhodamine 123 at 1 microgram/mL was selected to sensitize P3 tumor cells for treatment with the monochromatic argon laser at 514.5 nm. Exposure of P3 cells to laser energy levels of 700 to 950 J/cm2 (36 degrees C to 40 degrees C) after sensitization with Rh 123 completely inhibited tumor development of the P3 cells transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Control P3 cells treated with the laser alone at 36 degrees C to 40 degrees C or only with Rh 123 formed visible tumors by one week and continued to grow for the entire-week observation period. These results show that Rh 123 is a highly sensitive new fluorochrome for argon laser phototherapy of human squamous carcinoma cells.\r"
