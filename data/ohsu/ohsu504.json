  ".W": "Recognition that myocardial infarction is caused by coronary thrombosis has stimulated a search for a safe, rapidly acting, and effective thrombolytic regimen. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) can provide relatively clot-selective thrombolysis, but one quarter of patients fail to achieve reperfusion, lysis speed is not optimal, and higher doses have been associated with an increased incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. We report the results of a multicenter study of pro-urokinase, a second naturally occurring plasminogen activator that has structural similarities to t-PA but has a different mechanism of action. Pro-urokinase was administered 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours after the onset of chest pain to 40 patients with acute myocardial infarction with angiographically confirmed complete coronary occlusion (TIMI grade 0). After a 90-minute intravenous infusion of pro-urokinase (4.7-9 million units, 36-69 mg) 51% (20 of 39) of the patients demonstrated reperfusion (TIMI grade 2 or 3) occurring 64.8 +/- 22.3 minutes after initiation of therapy. Fibrinogen levels fell only 10 +/- 17% from baseline, confirming the fibrin specificity of pro-urokinase. As with t-PA, however, this specificity was only relative. alpha 2-Antiplasmin decreased to 39% and plasminogen decreased to 64% of initial values. Fibrinogen degradation products increased 63% and the fibrin-specific D-dimer increased 8.7-fold. Thus, pro-urokinase produces relatively clot-selective coronary thrombolysis similar to that produced by t-PA, but the use of either pro-urokinase or t-PA alone in higher doses would be likely to produce more nonspecific effects.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether balloon angioplasty can provoke arterial vasoconstriction independent of platelet aggregation and neurogenic input, we studied the spontaneous vasomotor effects of balloon dilatation in isolated, perfused whole-vessel segments of rabbit aorta and pig carotid artery. Freshly dissected rabbit thoracic aortas were mounted in a muscle bath-perfusion chamber, perfused with physiologic saline solution at 70 mm Hg, and allowed to equilibrate. The proximal or distal half of the aortas were dilated with either a \"large\" (5 mm, 31-51% stretch beyond relaxed diameter) or a \"small\" (4 mm, 5-16% stretch) balloon angioplasty catheter with the other half of the vessel serving as the control. A similar series of experiments were performed in pig carotid arteries using \"large\" (6 or 8 mm, 48-90% stretch) balloon catheters. The spontaneous vasomotor effects of balloon angioplasty were examined with long-axis, high-frequency ultrasonic imaging combined with computerized edge detection image processing to measure changes in segmental internal vessel diameters. Additional experiments were carried out in rabbit aortas to determine the roles of the endothelium, extracellular calcium, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and calcium-channel blockade in modulating angioplasty-induced vasoconstriction. Significant arterial vasoconstriction was observed in the balloon angioplasty segments after dilatation with 5-mm balloons but not with 4-mm balloons. After dilatation with 5-mm balloons, the angioplasty segments' cross-sectional areas decreased by an average of 31% versus 4% for the nondilated (control) segments (p less than 0.0001). Similar postangioplasty vasoconstriction was observed in the pig carotid arteries (decrease in minimal vessel cross-sectional area of 41% [angioplasty segment] versus 2% [control segment]) (p less than 0.005). This angioplasty-induced vasoconstriction was prevented by endothelial denudation before angioplasty, removal of extracellular calcium, and pretreatment with indomethacin or ibuprofen. The vasoconstriction was only partially inhibited by calcium channel blockade with verapamil. These findings demonstrate that stretch-pressure-induced arterial vasoconstriction may occur after balloon angioplasty, independent of platelet aggregation and neurogenic input. This angioplasty-induced vasoconstriction appears to be mediated by an endothelially derived cyclooxygenase product(s).\r"

In the present study, we wanted to evaluate the role played by thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and serotonin (5HT) in mediating platelet activation during lysis of intracoronary thrombi with human recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Coronary thrombi were induced in 26 anesthetized, open-chest dogs by inserting a copper coil into the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). LAD blood flow was monitored throughout the experiment by means of a Doppler flow probe placed proximally to the coil. Presence of the thrombus was documented for 30 minutes. The dogs were then assigned to one of four groups as follows: group 1 dogs (n = 8), serving as controls, received a bolus of heparin (200 units/kg) and a bolus of t-PA (80 micrograms/kg) followed by a continuous infusion (8 micrograms/kg/min) for up to 90 minutes or until reperfusion was achieved; group 2 dogs (n = 10) received, immediately before heparin and t-PA, an intravenous bolus of SQ29548 (SQ) (0.4 mg/kg, a selective TXA2-receptor antagonist) and LY53857 (LY) (0.2 mg/kg, a selective serotonin S2-receptor antagonist); group 3 dogs (n = 7) received, before heparin and t-PA, an intravenous bolus of SQ alone (0.4 mg/kg); and group 4 dogs (n = 7) received, before heparin and t-PA, an intravenous bolus of LY alone (0.2 mg/kg).

  ".U": "89168702\r", 
  ".W": "Acute myocardial infarction is triggered by coronary artery occlusion that may be recanalized by thrombolytic therapy with a success rate of up to 75% only. The resistance of coronary artery occlusion to thrombolysis may either be due to obstruction of the lumen by a nonthrombotic mechanism or by intrinsic resistance of thrombus to dissolution. Coronary arterial thrombi are composed of platelet-rich and erythrocyte-rich material in variable proportions. To evaluate the relative sensitivity of these thrombus components to thrombolysis, we have used two femoral arterial thrombosis models in the rabbit, consisting of erythrocyte-rich clot produced by injecting whole blood and thrombin in an isolated segment and of platelet-rich thrombus spontaneously formed on an everted (inside out) femoral arterial segment. Intravenous infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a rate of 30 micrograms/kg/min consistently reperfused arteries occluded with erythrocyte-rich clot (six of six animals compared with zero of six placebo-treated animals, p = 0.002), whereas infusion of 30 or 100 micrograms/kg/min was significantly less efficient for reperfusion of everted segments occluded with platelet-rich material (only four of 12 animals, p = 0.01). Intra-arterial infusion proximal to the occlusion, at a rate of 20 micrograms/kg/min reperfused six of seven rabbits with erythrocyte-rich clots but only one of seven rabbits with occluded everted segments (p = 0.03). A dose of 100 micrograms/kg/min was necessary to reperfuse platelet-rich occlusions in five of six rabbits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We used a canine model of embolic pulmonary hypertension, induced by injection of autologous radioactive blood clots, to investigate effects of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on dynamics of thrombolysis and on pulmonary pressure-flow (PQ) characteristics. Over 5 (rt-PA5) or 15 (rt-PA15) minutes, 1 mg/kg rt-PA was infused. Rate and extent of thrombolysis were assessed by counting over both lung fields with a gamma camera. Emboli increased mean pulmonary artery pressure from 14 to 36 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). This change was predominantly due to an increase in the effective outflow pressure (PI) (from 9 to 29 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), obtained by extrapolation from the linear PQ relation. While pulmonary hemodynamics improved with rt-PA5 and rt-PA15, the change was greatest with rt-PA15. For example, the increase in PI that occurred with embolization was abolished with rt-PA15. Also, the decrease in pulmonary artery pressure was greatest with rt-PA15. While not significantly different, extent of total clot lysis tended to be greatest with rt-PA15 (p less than 0.07). Also, while during infusion, the concentration of rt-PA5 was threefold that of rt-PA15, the corresponding rate of thrombolysis was similar with rt-PA5 and rt-PA15. These results indicate that the improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics with rt-PA is primarily explained by a decrease in PI. Furthermore, they suggest an upper limit to the dose-thrombolytic rate relation with rt-PA.\r"

In another 25 immature rabbits, a PDS rod 3.2 mm in diameter and 25 mm in length was driven into a corresponding drill hole using the same technique. The follow-up intervals were three, six, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. The distal femoral growth plates of both femora were analyzed by roentgenographic, microroentgenographic, oxytetracycline-fluorescence, histologic, and histomorphometric studies. Histomorphometric studies showed clear changes at the site of injury and appeared to be an excellent means of providing an exact numerical description of the different cellular areas of the growth plate in experimental studies. A transphyseal PDS implant 2.0 mm in diameter did not cause any permanent growth disturbance of the femur in a growing rabbit. An implant 3.2 mm in diameter caused a growth disturbance similar to a drill hole of equal bore.\r"

Eight of them fulfilled the criteria of hypertension. 2. Normotensive patients before haemodialysis were classified in two groups: group 1 (pump-) with decreased erythrocyte Na+ pump activity, and group 2 (normal pump) with normal erythrocyte Na+ pump activity. Group 1 showed, compared with controls, a normal intracellular Na+ concentration and a decreased co-transport, but no difference in either countertransport or passive Na+ efflux. After haemodialysis this difference disappeared. Before haemodialysis, group 2 showed a high intracellular Na+ concentration, but activities of the Na+ transport systems studied were similar to those of controls. After haemodialysis, cell Na+ concentration decreased to a level not significantly different from that of controls. 3. Both before and after haemodialysis, hypertensive patients showed Na+ transport system activities and an intracellular Na+ concentration similar to those of controls. 4. Endogenous digoxin-like immunoreactivity (EDLI) and erythrocyte Na+ transport were studied in five normotensive and five hypertensive patients, before and after haemodialysis. EDLI in plasma was similar in both groups before and after haemodialysis. No correlation was found between EDLI and erythrocyte Na+ pump activity. 5. These results suggest the existence in some dialysed uraemic patients of alterations in erythrocyte Na+ fluxes, which may be corrected by haemodialysis. EDLI and erythrocyte Na+ fluxes do not seem to be markers of secondary hypertension in these patients.\r"

Plasma concentrations of ANF did not change significantly during hypoxia. 4. In contrast, during hypercapnia, plasma concentrations of ANF increased by more than 100% and returned to baseline at the end of hypercapnia. 5. Hypercapnia, but not hypoxia, induced an increase in left atrial and central venous pressures. 6. We conclude that hypercapnia increases plasma ANF concentration, and that this increase may be secondary to an increase of the left and right atrial pressures. These phenomena may explain the increase in diuresis and natriuresis which has been described during hypercapnia.\r"

EVA-recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha (10(4)-10(5) units) implants induced a qualitatively similar but less intense response. 3. In contrast, recombinant human interleukin-2 (10(2)-10(4) units) implants resulted in early lymphocytic vasculitis (4 days) and the development of a predominantly lymphoid lesion comprised of lymphoblasts and significant mononuclear cell proliferation by 7 days. 4. EVA-recombinant gamma-interferon (10(3)-10(4) units) implants failed to elicit a significant tissue response; with the exception of multinucleate giant cell formation the characteristics of these lesions closely resembled the mild fibrotic responses observed for EVA-bovine serum albumin (0.5-12.5 mg) implants. 5.

Forearm blood flow was markedly elevated at 33 degrees C ambient (mean total flow 9.1 at 33 degrees C vs 1.8 ml min-1 100 ml-1 at 23 degrees C), as were antecubital venous partial pressure of oxygen (mean 10.1 at 33 degrees C vs 5.6 kPa at 23 degrees C) and oxygen saturation (mean 92% at 33 degrees C vs 70% at 23 degrees C). There was a positive correlation between oxygen saturation and area under the glucose tolerance curve. 4. In separate experiments, arterialized glucose concentrations were measured after glucose ingestion at 23 degrees C ambient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether CPB influences pulmonary vascular sensitivity to CO2, we compared the effect of slight induced hypocarbia and hypercarbia on pulmonary circulation before and after CPB in ten mechanically ventilated patients undergoing CABG. Hypocarbia was produced by increasing tidal volume slightly and hypercarbia was then induced by adding CO2 to the inspired gas mixture. In another ten patients, hypercarbia was produced after CPB by decreasing ventilator rate and the cardiopulmonary responses to hypercarbia, produced by the two methods of CO2 elevation, were compared. Slight respiratory acidosis induced by CO2 inhalation did not change PVR before CPB but effected a 50 percent increase after CPB. Hypercarbia induced by alveolar hypoventilation after CPB increased PVR by 40 percent. During the increased CO2 production after hypothermic CPB, pulmonary vasoconstriction would be expected to occur and impair right ventricular performance. Therefore, tight control of PaCO2 with appropriate adjustment of ventilatory support is mandatory.\r"

The first dose of OKT3 induces side effects such as dyspnea in other transplant populations. We studied cardiopulmonary responses to OKT3 in 23 recipients of cardiac transplants. Despite pretreatment including antihistamines, hydrocortisone, and acetaminophen, OKT3 administered within 72 hours of transplantation, as part of prophylactic immunosuppression, induced a biphasic systemic response. Within the first hour, patients developed fever, hyperdynamia, hypertension, and tachycardia. By five to seven hours after the dose, there was mild hypotension, hypoxemia, and decreased indices of vascular resistance. Eighteen of the 23 patients required supplemental oxygen or vasopressor support (or both). Our findings define a complex cardiovascular response to OKT3 exhibited by the delayed noncoincident onset of hemodynamic instability, hypoxemia, and fever. Close observation in an ICU is recommended during the initial administration of OKT3 for prompt intervention when reactions occur.\r"

Preoperative radiation with 25 MeV betatron was employed according to the method developed by the authors. Radiation treatment was tolerated by patients in the absence of manifest general and local reactions. No decrease below 3000 in the rate of leukocytes was observed after a total dose of up to 40 Gy. After radiotherapy, improvement in the general state was achieved in 72 percent and positive roentgenologic findings were seen in 70.8 percent of patients. The preoperative irradiation therapy was followed by 153 radical and 28 palliative operations. There was no increase in postoperative morbidity or mortality. The morphologic study of surgical specimens showed that considerable changes in the tumoral tissue, including disappearance of cancer cells, were seen in 75 percent of cases. The five-year survival rate of 112 patients after radical surgery indicates that it is worthwhile to use the combined treatment approach for tumors located in the right colon and in cases of suspected or existing infiltration into adjacent organs and tissues.\r"

  ".U": "89170467\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the role of the adrenal glands in the acute inhibition of gonadotropins induced by CRH in the primate, we have compared the effects of CRH infusion on LH and FSH before and after adrenalectomy and under variable glucocorticoid backgrounds. The studies were performed in four ovariectomized rhesus monkeys. Confirming previous observations, a 5-h iv CRH (rat/human CRH, 100-150 micrograms/h), but not saline, infusion inhibited both LH and FSH secretion. Saline and CRH infusions were repeated at random intervals after adrenalectomy under each of three different glucocorticoid backgrounds, achieved by varying the glucocorticoid replacement therapy (groups 1-3). At the time of the saline or CRH tests, mean cortisol concentrations were 38.5 +/- 6.3 (+/- SE) micrograms/dl before adrenalectomy, and 21.9 +/- 1.4, 14.3 +/- 1.1, and less than 1.0 micrograms/dl in groups 1, 2, and 3 of adrenalectomized (ADX) monkeys. In response to CRH infusion, gonadotropin concentrations significantly decreased in groups 2 and 3, but not in group 1 ADX monkeys which had the highest cortisol background. By hour 5 of CRH infusion, the percentages of the preinfusion baseline area under the curves for LH were 96.8 +/- 6.2%, 44.6 +/- 3.7%, and 53.5 +/- 6.1%, for groups 1, 2, and 3; by hour 4 the values for FSH were 95.7 +/- 3.5%, 76.2 +/- 4.7%, and 74.7 +/- 4.0% for groups 1-3, respectively. The absence of a response to CRH in group 1 animals occurred even though mean cortisol concentrations were lower than those in the same monkeys before ADX. Morphine (9 mg, iv), which had previously been shown to decrease LH and FSH concentrations in ovariectomized monkeys, also significantly decreased LH and FSH concentrations in ADX monkeys of group 1, which did not respond to CRH. The maximal decline occurred by hour 3 after morphine injection, when LH and FSH areas under the curve were 51.5 +/- 11.4% and 61.0 +/- 3.2% of the preinfusion baseline. Our results clearly indicate that in the primate the adrenal glands are not required for the acute CRH inhibitory effect on LH and FSH, and consequently, the decrease in gonadotropins that follows CRH is not mediated by the resultant increase in cortisol release, but, rather, by central mechanisms. The results also show that the effectiveness of CRH in inhibiting gonadotropins in the ADX monkey is affected by the amount of glucocorticoids present at the time of the test; unexpectedly, the ADX monkey is more sensitive to this protective effect of glucocorticoids than the non-ADX animal.\r"

  ".U": "89170470\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of sodium butyrate treatment on TRH-degrading enzymes and TRH receptors in GH3 cells was investigated. The specific activity of pyroglutamyl peptidase I (EC 3.4.19.3) was increased by exposure to sodium butyrate in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, whereas the specific activity of prolyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26) was unchanged. The maximal effect occurred at a concentration of 1 mM sodium butyrate and 16 h after exposure. The increase was reversible upon removal of sodium butyrate from the cell culture. Cycloheximide totally blocked the stimulation, indicating that the increase was due to new protein synthesis. Sodium butyrate had no effect on pyroglutamyl peptidase I activity in the AtT-20 cell line. [methyl-3H]TRH binding to intact GH3 cells was reduced to 70% of the control value when cells were exposed to 1 mM sodium butyrate for 8 h. A maximal decrease in binding to 40% of the control value occurred after 16 h of exposure. The Kd of [methyl-3H]TRH binding was not changed. Sodium butyrate altered GH3 cell morphology, but the morphological changes occurred after alterations of pyroglutamyl peptidase I activity and [methyl-3H]TRH-binding sites. Other agents known to alter GH3 cell morphology had no effect on pyroglutamyl peptidase I activity. These results indicate that sodium butyrate can in some respects mimic the action of T3 on GH3 cells. Moreover, they provide further evidence that the activity of pyroglutamyl peptidase I, but not prolyl endopeptidase, is subject to regulation in the GH3 cell.\r"

  ".W": "Adult male rats were made bilaterally cryptorchid for 3, 7, 10, and 14 days, and the peripheral serum, testicular vein serum, and interstitial fluid levels of inhibin were measured by RIA, and compared with values obtained in intact animals. The levels of inhibin in peripheral serum, testicular vein, and interstitial fluid were significantly elevated (P less than 0.01) after 3 days of cryptorchidism but declined significantly thereafter. The secretion of inhibin was also studied in vitro using isolated segments of seminiferous tubules from scrotal and abdominal testis in adult rats made unilaterally cryptorchid for 3, 6, and 12 days. The basal inhibin secretion by 3-day cryptorchid seminiferous tubules incubated at 37 C was significantly greater when compared with the scrotal seminiferous tubules at 32 C. If seminiferous tubules from scrotal testes were incubated at 37 C, the secretion of inhibin was greatly increased to similar levels observed by the 3-day abdominal seminiferous tubule cultures. In addition inhibin secretion was significantly higher when tubules from 5-week hypophysectomized rats were cultured at 37 C compared to 32 C. The inhibin secretion by seminiferous tubules from 6-day abdominal testes had returned to scrotal seminiferous tubule levels but then decreased below scrotal seminiferous tubule levels after 12 days of cryptorchidism. Seminiferous tubules from cryptorchid testes remain responsive to FSH stimulation (500 ng/ml) up to 12 days of cryptorchidism. FSH-stimulated inhibin production was increased at 3 and 12 days after cryptorchidism, but similar at 6 days after cryptorchidism, compared to the response of tubules obtained from scrotal testes. Furthermore, using seminiferous tubules from normal adult rats, FSH-stimulated inhibin production was increased by raising the incubation temperature from 32 C to 37 C. These in vivo and in vitro data suggest a dual stimulatory and inhibitory effect of higher temperature on inhibin production with an initial rise in basal and FSH-stimulated inhibin secretion by the cryptorchid testis which seems to be due to a direct effect of temperature on Sertoli cells. The subsequent decline in inhibin secretion could be due to the disruption of the seminiferous epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "Factors regulating LH/hCG responsiveness in primate granulosa cells were examined in the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). Granulosa cells were isolated and pooled from small antral (0.5-1.0 mm) and large preovulatory (greater than or equal to 2 mm) follicles from mid- to late follicular phase ovaries of cyclic marmosets. The cells from small and large follicles were cultured in serum-free medium for 48 h in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of hCG (0.1-100 ng/ml) with or without 0.1 microM androgen [testosterone or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT]). Granulosa cells from small follicles were also cultured in the absence or presence of a constant concentration of human FSH (30 ng/ml) with or without androgen for 48 h before exposure to hCG for an additional 48 h. Steroidogenic responsiveness was assessed by measuring progesterone accumulation in culture medium and aromatase activity in washed monolayers. Granulosa cells from large follicles showed dose-dependent increases in both progesterone accumulation and aromatase activity in response to treatment with hCG. In contrast, granulosa cells from small follicles were unresponsive to hCG. However, pretreatment of granulosa cells from small follicles for 48 h with FSH stimulated hCG responsiveness. The effects of both testosterone and DHT on hCG-stimulated aromatase activity and progesterone accumulation by granulosa cells from large preovulatory follicles were inhibitory. Testosterone and DHT also suppressed basal (no hCG) progesterone accumulation in these cells, but had no effect on basal aromatase activity. The effects of androgens on FSH-induced hCG responsiveness in immature granulosa cells were variable. The results show a development-related increase in marmoset granulosa cell responsiveness to LH/hCG and provide evidence that FSH and androgens interact to regulate the onset and expression of this critical event during preovulatory follicular development in the primate ovary.\r"

  ".U": "89170477\r", 
  ".W": "The present study was designed to determine whether atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) could be both synthesized and internalized by rat anterior pituitary gonadotrophs. ANP synthesis was assessed by in situ hybridization of ultrathin frozen sections of anterior pituitary to a biotinylated 30-base oligonucleotide to rat ANP mRNA. As revealed by the immunogold technique, only gonadotrophs were labeled by the probe. At the subcellular level, ANP mRNA was observed at both the nuclear and cytoplasmic levels in gonadotrophs, and labeling of the latter compartment was quantitatively more intense. Internalization of ANP was investigated by an in vivo ultrastructural autoradiographic approach. Intravenous injection of [125I]ANP resulted in rapid labeling within 1 min of the plasma membrane, cytoplasmic matrix, secretory vesicle, and mitochondrial compartments and the Golgi apparatus; these compartments were labeled throughout the remainder of the time course studied (1-30 min). Peak labeling of the plasma membrane compartment was at 1 min and diminished from that point; labeling in the Golgi apparatus peaked 5 min postinjection, while in the other compartments labeling was fairly uniform over the time course. The lysosomal compartment was also radiolabeled; however, only 2 and 5 min after injection of [125I]ANP. The findings demonstrate that gonadotrophs can both synthesize and internalize extracellular ANP. These observations can be extended to suggest that ANP has both autocrine and paracrine actions in the anterior pituitary gland. Since the peptide neither stimulates nor antagonizes the release of any anterior pituitary hormone, these actions are probably unrelated to the adenohypophyseal secretory function.\r"

This ovine plasma-derived immunoreactivity diluted in parallel to the ME-RF standard in RIA and chromatographed as two low mol wt species (approximately 1K) which were less hydrophobic than the standard on size exclusion and reverse phase chromatography. The pepsin-generated material displaced [3H]naloxone from rat brain binding sites; its potency was about 1000-fold that of ME-RF, assuming near 100% cross-reactivity with the antiserum. Taken together these observations suggest that the pepsin-generated material is of similar mol wt and amino acid sequence to ME-RF, but differs with respect to opiate-binding efficacy, and that the plasma precursor is distinct from proenkephalin in both size and processing sites.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the interaction of estrogen with GnRH on the regulation of LH subunit mRNA in female hypogonadal (hpg) mice receiving constant frequency and amplitude pulsatile GnRH treatment for up to 18 days. The level of cytosolic common alpha mRNA in female hpg mouse pituitaries was 45 +/- 6% of normal female littermate values, and treatment with pulsatile GnRH increased alpha mRNA to 40% above the normal value at 24 h and 2-4 times normal at 7 and 12 days (P less than 0.001); by 18 days levels had returned to those of untreated hpg controls. Concurrent treatment with estradiol (E2) did not affect those changes. However, in ovariectomized hpg mice the 2- to 4-fold rise in alpha mRNA was sustained for 18 days with GnRH treatment. E2 treatment alone for 7 and 12 days doubled alpha mRNA. LH beta mRNA levels in untreated female hpg mice were between 5-10% of normal values. Levels increased significantly (77 +/- 6.4%) 24 h after GnRH treatment and were normal at 7, 12, and 18 days. E2 together with GnRH did not affect the LH beta mRNA increase at 12 days, but reduced it to 45% of normal at 18 days. Ovariectomy did not alter the LH beta mRNA response to GnRH treatment, and E2 treatment alone did not increase LH beta mRNA. Serum LH concentrations were normalized by GnRH treatment at all times and did not increase in ovariectomized animals. LH release was prevented when E2 was combined with GnRH. Pituitary LH content in hpg mice was 20% of normal and increased gradually with GnRH treatment. Neither concurrent treatment with E2 nor ovariectomy affected the GnRH-induced synthesis of LH. PRL mRNA levels were 30-40% of normal littermate values in untreated female hpg mice, and pulsatile GnRH increased these to 70-80% of normal. E2 alone raised PRL mRNA slightly above normal values, although together with GnRH this rise was attenuated by about 40%. Pulsatile GnRH treatment of ovariectomized hpg mice did not increase PRL mRNA. E2 increased pituitary PRL content, and GnRH did not attenuate this aspect of E2 action. Serum PRL levels rose with E2 treatment at 7 and 12 days, and concurrent GnRH treatment prevented the rise at 12 days. We conclude the following: 1) The stimulatory action of pulsatile GnRH on the expression of both common alpha and LH beta mRNA is rapid (less than 24 h).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Hypophyses were removed from hamster fetuses at a gestational age of 14 days. Some of these were immediately fixed in Bouin's solution, and others were transplanted into the hosts. The hosts were injected sc twice daily with 1 microgram LHRH or vehicle for 16 days. Six hosts in each group were killed by decapitation 16 h after the last injection. Six 14-day-old normal male hamsters (age-matched to correspond to the age of the allografts at the time of the hosts' decapitation) also were decapitated. Sections of hypophyses in situ from fetal hamsters, from 14-day-old controls, and from allografts in each group were stained for LH, FSH, or PRL and with hematoxylin. No PRL-containing cells and very few LH or FSH cells (less than 0.025% of the adenohypophysial cell population) were observed in fetal pituitary glands. In allografts from the vehicle-treated hosts, 21.1% of adenohypophysial cells contained LH, but only 1.8% contained FSH. In allografts from LHRH-treated hosts, 28.0% and 22.9% of the adenohypophysial cells contained LH and FSH, respectively. Adenohypophyses that developed for the same length of time in situ had smaller percentages of adenohypophysial cells containing LH (23.8%) and FSH (15.5%) than the LHRH-treated group. LH-containing cells in allografts in the vehicle-treated hamsters, but not in the LHRH-treated animals, were reduced in size compared to those measured in situ. The number of lactotrophs in all allografted tissue was markedly reduced compared to that of lactotrophs in situ, and injection of LHRH into hamsters with allografts did not alter the percentage of adenohypophysial cells that were lactotrophs. These results suggest that in the hamster LHRH 1) plays an important role in stimulating the formation of immunoreactive FSH in the pituitary gland, 2) can increase the number of gonadotrophs that develop during the neonatal period, and 3) plays a role in controlling the size of gonadotrophs during development. The results also suggest that the development of lactotroph cell number requires close proximity to the hypothalamus and/or exposure to a neonatal environment. We found no evidence to support the view that LHRH, LH, or FSH stimulates immunoreactive lactotroph differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism whereby gonadal steroids modulate GnRH-stimulated LH secretion by primary cultures of chicken pituitary cells was investigated. Estradiol (10(-8) M), testosterone (10(-7) M), and progesterone (10(-7) M) inhibited LH release stimulated by GnRH (10(-7) M) by 56%, 61%, and 53%, respectively, and the inhibitory effects required prolonged preincubation (24-48 h) with the steroids. The steroids inhibited the spike (0-3 min) and plateau (9-30 min) phases of LH release to a similar degree. The ED50 values of estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone for inhibition of GnRH-stimulated LH release were 7 x 10(-11), 2 x 10(-9), and 1 x 10(-9) M, respectively. Estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone inhibited the maximal LH response to GnRH, but the ED50 of GnRH (4 x 10(-9) M) was not altered by steroid pretreatment. Steroid pretreatment did not cause a change in cellular LH content, suggesting that the steroids do not inhibit LH synthesis. Combinations of two or three of the steroids were not additive, suggesting that all three steroids affect GnRH-stimulated LH release via the same mechanism. In experiments investigating their mechanism of action, the steroids inhibited LH release stimulated by GnRH and Ca2+ ionophore A23187, but generally had no effect on the responses to phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), forskolin, K+, Bay K8644, or veratridine. Estradiol inhibited GnRH-stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux, but its inhibitory effect on GnRH-induced inositol phosphate production was not significant. Estradiol had no effect on binding of 125I-[His5,D-Tyr6]GnRH to a pituitary cell preparation. These findings suggest that the site of steroid modulation of GnRH action is distal to binding of GnRH to its receptor, and that the inhibitory effects are exerted at two intracellular sites: 1) the coupling events linking receptor activation to mobilization of Ca2+, and 2) a site distal to Ca2+ mobilization.\r"

With this antiserum, immunostaining of Western blots of rat brain extracts revealed two major proteins with mol wt (Mr = 39,000 and 52,000) considerably larger than that of the largest protein (Mr = 29,000) that could be encoded by the cDNA of Lechan et al. Because these observations suggested the possibility of novel TRH precursors, we studied the immunocytochemical distribution of pro-TRH (39-52K) in rat brain. Our anatomical findings were 4-fold. 1) The distributions of 29K pro-TRH and 39-52K pro-TRH are not identical. 2) TRH is found only in regions containing 29K pro-TRH, 39-52K pro-TRH, or both. 3) There are regions that contain both 29K pro-TRH and 39-52K pro-TRH, but no TRH. 4) Regions containing only 39-52K pro-TRH do not contain 29K pro-TRH mRNA as mapped by Segerson et al. From these electrophoretic and anatomical observations, we postulate the existence of at least one and possibly two additional precursors that can be processed to TRH in rat brain.\r"

  ".W": "We injected hCG into pseudopregnant rabbits on day 7 of pseudopregnancy and analyzed changes in the components of luteal adenylyl cyclase system in order to determine which components are responsible for altered hormonal responsiveness upon desensitization. hCG-induced desensitization was homologous (loss of responsiveness to LH) early (first 6 h), then became heterologous (partial loss of responsiveness to catecholamines) later (12-48 h). The total number of LH receptors was reduced approximately 30% 3 h after treatment at a time when LH stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity was not altered. Total LH receptors remained at this level until 24 h, when total receptors were reduced by 88%. While total LH receptor number remained constant, LH-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was declining to 57% of the control value at 12 h. Available unoccupied LH receptors were reduced by 96% at 12 h. The affinity of the occupied receptors was reduced 4-fold before down-regulation. The changes in beta-adrenergic receptor number paralleled the changes in catecholamine responsiveness. hCG treatment also altered luteal G-protein function, as assessed by reconstitution of adenylyl cyclase activity in S49 cyc- lymphoma membranes and ADP ribosylation by cholera and pertussis toxins. Isoproterenol (ISO)-reconstituting activities of luteal Gs (the stimulatory G-protein of adenylyl cyclase) were depressed by 65% 12-48 h after hCG treatment, the same time as reduced catecholamine responsiveness. In contrast, NaF-reconstituting activities were at control levels at 12 h and reduced by 55% at 24 and 48 h. Pertussis toxin's ability to ADP ribosylate alpha i 40 was increased 3 and 6 h after treatment, while cholera toxin's ability to ADP ribosylate alpha s 45 was reduced throughout the study period. These studies demonstrate that hCG-induced heterologous desensitization results in a complex series of changes in beta-adrenergic and LH receptors as well as G-protein function, which account for the altered hormonal responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of injecting epinephrine into pseudopregnant rabbits on the luteal adenylyl cyclase system were analyzed. Epinephrine-induced desensitization was heterologous and associated with a reduced response to isoproterenol, LH, NaF, and forskolin. Epinephrine-induced desensitization was rapid in onset, with a maximum decrease in responsiveness 6 h after treatment and responsiveness returning to control levels within 24 h of treatment. The changes in beta-adrenergic receptor content paralleled changes in catecholamine responsiveness. The affinity of the beta-receptors from treated animals decreased 1.5- to 2-fold before down-regulation. LH receptor number was not altered by epinephrine treatment, although responsiveness to LH was depressed. LH receptor affinity, however, was reduced about 2-fold by epinephrine treatment. Epinephrine treatment also altered G-protein function in corpora lutea, as assessed by reconstitution of adenylyl cyclase activity in S49 cyc- membranes and ADP ribosylation by cholera and pertussis toxins. NaF- and isoproterenol-reconstituting activities of luteal Gs (the stimulatory G-protein of adenylyl cyclase) were depressed for the first 6 h after treatment. The ability of cholera toxin to ADP ribosylate alpha s 46 and alpha s 45 was reduced 1.5-6 h and 3-12 h, respectively, after epinephrine treatment. The reduced ability of cholera toxin to ADP ribosylate alpha s 45 was associated with the decrease in LH receptor affinity after treatment. This supports the contention that alpha s 45 preferentially interacts with the LH receptor. These studies demonstrate that the loss of LH responsiveness upon epinephrine-induced heterologous desensitization is associated with altered G-protein function.\r"

  ".W": "The present study further examined the role of arachidonic acid (AA) in the action of LHRH on ovarian steroidogenesis. Rat granulosa cells were incubated with LHRH and/or AA in the presence of FSH for 24 h. As expected, the presence of LHRH markedly attenuated the FSH-induced progesterone (P) production. AA by itself did not affect the magnitude of P production induced by FSH. However, when AA (10(-5) M) was added during the last 6 h to the cultures containing LHRH and FSH, AA partially reversed the inhibitory action of LHRH (by 42%). Likewise, addition of AA partially antagonized the inhibitory effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 10(-9) M) on FSH-induced P production (by 71%). Pretreatment of granulosa cells with TPA or LHRH without FSH for 18 h did not alter the stimulatory effect of AA on P formation during the subsequent 6-h culture period. In other experiments granulosa cells were incubated for 5 h in the absence of FSH. Treatment with AA, TPA, or LHRH alone caused significant increase in P production. Combined treatment with AA and LHRH or AA plus TPA showed additive effects on P formation. By contrast, AA failed to potentiate the effect of LHRH or TPA on 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone accumulation. Although AA by itself slightly stimulated 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone production, the magnitude was much less than that induced by TPA or LHRH. When 25-hydroxycholesterol was present in the incubation medium, P production was significantly increased. In the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol, AA further increased P formation, but did not enhance the stimulatory actions of LHRH or TPA in this regard. Taken together, these results further support the hypothesis that AA (or its metabolites) play a stimulatory role in the direct action of LHRH on ovarian steroidogenesis.\r"

Few features distinguished patients with bisynchronous spike-waves from those with only focal temporal spikes: a higher incidence of patients with more than two grand mal seizures a year (43 vs. 7%) and a younger age at last recording (22.5 vs. 28.3 years) were the only statistically reliable factors. Proportion of patients with complex partial seizures (CPS) (100%), age of CPS onset, incidence of febrile convulsions, intellectual level, and normal neurologic examination were features common to the two groups. In contrast to other studies which did not exclude influencing variables such as extratemporal spike foci, our group with bisynchronous spike-waves fared equally well after temporal lobectomy as did patients with temporal spikes alone. All 6 patients with spike-waves obtained a reduction of at least 50% in seizure frequency and 5 of the 6 (83%) had a greater than 90% reduction. Sixteen of 17 patients (94%) without spike-waves had a reduction of at least 50% and 14 of the 17 (82%) had a greater than 90% reduction of seizures.\r"

This study tested this hypothesis by comparing risks of unprovoked seizures in offspring of individuals with generalized versus partial epilepsy. Overall, seizure incidence was no higher in offspring of persons with generalized epilepsy than in offspring of those with partial epilepsy. The number of affected offspring was about three times that expected from population incidence rates, regardless of whether the parent had partial or generalized epilepsy. For the subgroup of generalized cases with absence seizures, however, seizure incidence in offspring was about three times as high as for partial cases. The higher incidence in offspring of absence cases was only partly explained by a higher proportion of absence than partial cases with two factors associated with high risk in relatives, namely early age at onset and idiopathic epilepsy. Offspring of absence cases had higher risk than offspring of other cases not only for absence seizures, but for other seizure types as well, suggesting that absence epilepsy is not genetically distinct from other seizure types of epilepsy. These results suggest that the higher incidence sometimes observed in relatives of patients with generalized epilepsy is due to a small proportion of generalized cases with extremely high familial risks--most generalized epilepsies are no more likely than partial epilepsies to have a genetic basis.\r"

Serum drug concentrations were also determined to detect possible effects on plasma or platelet taurine concentrations. The plasma and platelet taurine concentrations of epileptic subjects were significantly more variable than corresponding control data. Mean platelet taurine was significantly lower for epileptic patients than for controls. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on data from epileptic patients revealed no significant association between platelet or plasma taurine concentrations and drug or seizure groups. However, t tests revealed a higher mean plasma taurine concentration for patients with primary generalized seizure disorders (group II) receiving valproate (VPA) (p less than 0.004). Utilizing serum drug concentrations, a significant negative correlation (rxy = -0.552) was found between log-converted platelet taurine and serum VPA concentrations (p less than 0.01) among group II patients. Results were interpreted as having potential value for less empiric drug use and as indicating that cellular rather than plasma studies will prove more informative in gaining an understanding of the idiopathic epilepsies.\r"

The activity of CAII was measured by microassay, and the total amount was measured by immunoassay methods developed in this laboratory. From the activity (units per microgram of protein) and total amount (nanograms per microgram protein) data, the specific activity (units per nanogram CAII) of the enzyme was calculated. With multiple doses, tolerance developed to both elevation of the EST and modification of the MES pattern noted with single doses of AZM. Accompanying the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of AZM was an increase in both the activity and specific activity of CAII in the various subcellular fractions and areas of the brain. The effects were dose dependent. Tolerance to the EST-elevating effects of AZM correlated with increases in the activity, total amount, and specific activity of CAII in the myelin fraction of the cerebral cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Before treatment, all ten women had a normal response to Buserelin challenge test and the GnRH test, and seven of the ten responded to estradiol (E2) benzoate test (2 mg intramuscularly). The SC administration of Buserelin (1.5 mg) for 6 days resulted in suppression of pituitary activity. Continuous treatment with Buserelin (1.2 mg for 3 weeks) was effective as demonstrated by decreasing serum E2 levels to below 20 pg/ml, and in the absence of ovarian follicles in ultrasonographic scanning. Three days after cessation of Buserelin treatment, the pituitary again responded to the GnRH test. Thus, the authors concluded that the administration of Buserelin in very high doses can induce medical hypophysectomy within 6 days, but over 3 weeks of suppression therapy are required to abolish ovarian findings. Desensitization of the pituitary was reversible within 3 days of cessation of the treatment.\r"

The return of FSH and LH secretion occurred in the second postpartum week and initially was characterized by a high FSH/LH ratio. The causes of the 1-week delay in resumption of pituitary gonadotropin secretion are not known, but endogenous opioids may play a role. The possible relation between the high FSH/LH ratio and low LH pulse frequency also is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied the role of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in luteal steroidogenesis by replacing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) infusion with pure FSH 48 hours after ovulation in two hypogonadotropic patients. Plasma progesterone (P) and estradiol (E2) decreased after FSH administration. Human luteal cells were cultured for 48 hours in the presence and absence of FSH, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), testosterone (T), or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (Bu2cAMP). In the presence of T, E2 synthesis increased significantly, indicating an active aromatase system in these cells. Human chorionic gonadotropin as well as Bu2cAMP significantly increased E2, T, and P synthesis. Follicle-stimulating hormone did not stimulate luteal E2, T, or P synthesis. The authors conclude that FSH does not sustain luteal steroidogenesis. Moreover, the in vitro findings reveal that hCG modulation of luteal E2 synthesis is mediated principally by an increase in androgen precursors. These in vivo and in vitro results confirm a crucial role for luteinizing hormone (LH) in the maintenance of luteal steroidogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is an important effector of plasma lipoprotein due to its interaction with cell-surface receptors. In addition, it is secreted by rat and human ovarian granulosa cells in tissue culture, and its production is hormonally modulated. Such observations indicate that apoE should be found in human follicular fluid (FF) and that its abundance therein may be subject to hormonal regulation. The authors have collected FF from seven normally cycling women by needle puncture at the time of laparoscopy and from hyperstimulated ovaries of four women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Apolipoprotein E is present in human FF. The ratio of apoE concentration in FF to that in serum, as determined by western blot analysis, ranges from 0.43 to 4.2 for the normally cycling patients and from 0.16 to 0.77 for the IVF patients. Serum estrogen levels (range, 42 to 477 pg/ml) for the cycling patients are inversely correlated with the FF-to-serum ratio of apoE (r = 0.91). The content of apoE in FF, relative to serum, thus falls dramatically as the follicle approaches ovulation. These data, plus the known ability of apoE to carry cholesterol and other lipids, suggest an important role for apoE in the ovary.\r"

Patients with low basal FSH levels (less than 15 mIU/ml) had higher pregnancy rates per attempt than those with moderate levels (15 to 24.9 mIU/ml), both of which were higher than those with high FSH levels (greater than 25 mIU/ml). Basal LH and E2 values did not improve the predictive value beyond that provided by FSH. Ongoing pregnancy rates per attempt in the low, moderate, and high FSH groups were 17.0%, 9.3%, and 3.6%, respectively (P less than 0.01). The three groups differed significantly in the percentage of patients having two ovaries, the mean number of follicles aspirated per retrieval, the mean number of preovulatory oocytes obtained, and peak E2 values (P less than 0.01).

The functional viability of HFP after cryopreservation by stepwise addition of dimethyl sulfoxide was determined. Human fetal pancreas explants (1-2 mm3; gestational age 16-21 wk) were prepared and slowly cooled (0.25 degrees C/min) to -40 degrees C before placement in liquid nitrogen. After rapid thaw (37 degrees C) and overnight culture, insulin release in response to high glucose and theophylline challenge determined in vitro functional viability. No difference was found between the responses of fresh and cryopreserved tissue (fresh 29.2 +/- 3.0 ng/mg tissue, cryopreserved 29.9 +/- 3.3 ng/mg tissue; P greater than .1). Diabetic BALB/c nu/nu mice transplanted with cryopreserved HFP returned to normoglycemia in 11 +/- 2 wk (range 8-15 wk). Oral glucose tolerance tests indicated in vivo serum glucose control equivalent to or better than that of nondiabetic control mice (peak serum glucose of nondiabetic mice 164 +/- 66 mg/dl, of cryopreserved grafted mice 180 +/- 67 mg/dl; P greater than .8). In vitro insulin release of cryopreserved grafted tissue demonstrated that the tissue had differentiated and matured and was now capable of responding to high-glucose challenge (39.3 +/- 11.5 ng insulin released/mg tissue). The results described herein are the first demonstration that cryopreserved HFP maintains the in vivo capacity to differentiate and mature and the capacity to reverse diabetes in an animal system.\r"

The grafts, consisting of 150 C57BL/6 or 250 C57BL/Ks mouse islets, were implanted syngeneically under the left kidney capsule of normoglycemic or alloxan-induced diabetic recipients 4 wk before the perfusion. In both mouse strains, islets grafted to normoglycemic animals showed an immediate distinct peak of insulin release when challenged with high glucose, whereas no response was observed from islets grafted to hyperglycemic mice. In a similar way in C57BL/Ks mice, arginine stimulated insulin release from the islet grafts in normoglycemic but not in hyperglycemic recipients. Insulin treatment of the diabetic recipients, however, partially normalized the insulin response to glucose. Islet grafts were removed in toto and analyzed for contents of insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and DNA or rates of glucose-stimulated (pro)insulin biosynthesis. In both mouse strains, islets implanted into hyperglycemic animals contained significantly less insulin, and their rates of (pro)insulin biosynthesis were markedly decreased. Insulin treatment only marginally affected these parameters. The glucagon content of the grafted islets was unaffected by the hyperglycemia in both strains of mice, whereas a significant decrease in the somatostatin content was observed in the C57BL/Ks mice. We concluded that grafted islets exposed to prolonged hyperglycemic stress become functionally impaired in mice of both strains. Our perfusion technique of islet-graft-bearing kidneys in combination with biochemical studies on the removed grafts provides a suitable model for studies of the effects of prolonged hyperglycemia on islet beta-cell function.\r"

Six months after distribution of the fliers, a randomized survey of 100 of these households was conducted to determine the fliers' success at increasing consumers' awareness of the center's location and altering consumers' attitudes and behavior concerning using the center's services. In 27% of the households, someone recalled receiving the flier. Half of these still had the fliers in their possession.

We performed a prospective double-blind controlled study to investigate AAD in hospitalized patients and to evaluate the effect of S. boulardii, a living yeast, given in capsule form concurrently with antibiotics. Over 23 mo, 180 patients completed the study. Of the patients receiving placebo, 22% experienced diarrhea compared with 9.5% of patients receiving S. boulardii (p = 0.038). Risk factors found to be associated with AAD were multiple antibiotic combinations (containing clindamycin, cephalosporins, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and tube feeding. Clostridium difficile, an anaerobe found in the stools of most patients with pseudomembranous colitis, was variably associated with AAD. We evaluated the role of C. difficile in AAD in the study population and found no significant association between the presence of C. difficile or cytotoxin with AAD. Approximately 33% of the patients without diarrhea harbored at least one C. difficile-positive stool and nearly 50% of these patients had detectable cytotoxin. Similar values were obtained in patients with diarrhea. Of C. difficile-positive patients, 31% (5/16) on placebo developed diarrhea compared with 9.4% (3/32) on S. boulardii; this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). There were no discernable adverse effects of yeast administration. We conclude that S. boulardii reduces the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in hospitalized patients.\r"

Rat atriopeptin III was injected into male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) via the femoral vein while under pentobarbital anesthesia, and aldosterone receptors in the kidney cytosol were determined. The maximum binding capacity and dissociation constant were calculated by the Scatchard analysis. Maximum binding capacity of both types of aldosterone receptor (Type I, high affinity and low binding capacity and Type II, low affinity and high binding capacity) gradually decreased after ANF injection, reached the lowest level after 2 hours, and then slightly recovered. When more than 2.5 micrograms/kg of rat atriopeptin III was injected, the density of aldosterone receptors significantly decreased. Injection of 12.5 micrograms/kg of rat atriopeptin III decreased maximum binding capacity of Type I receptor from 42.3 +/- 2.4 (mean +/- SD, n = 6) to 22.8 +/- 3.2 femtomole/mg protein (n = 6) (p less than 0.01), and that of Type II receptor decreased from 388 +/- 46 to 285 +/- 30 fmol/mg protein (p less than 0.01). Dissociation constant of both types of receptors did not change significantly after ANF injection. Plasma aldosterone concentration showed no significant change after ANF injection, and a significant change was noted after ANF administration on aldosterone receptors in the experiments on adrenalectomized rats 7 days after operation. Furosemide had no significant effect on aldosterone receptors in both normal and adrenalectomized rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An ongoing debate ensues at the federal level of the utility of improving the DRG system, given the \"budget neutrality\" provision of the DRG law. We analyzed hospital resource consumption for 5809 cardiology inpatients by outcome (i.e., survival vs death). Hospital resource use was greater and financial risk under DRG pricing schemes was substantial for the 312 deaths compared with the 5497 survivors. Only cases in which the patient died within 1 week of admission to the hospital were profitable under DRGs. A long hospital length of stay for patients who eventually died was very unprofitable (those who died after more than a 60-day hospital length of stay generated a $24,688 loss per patient). Patients who died after emergency admission tended to have a similar hospital length of stay and to be similar financial risk under DRGs, compared with nonemergency patients who died. Those patients who had been referred from other clinical services and who died caused greater resource use and financial risk under DRGs, compared with patients who were not referred and who died. These data suggest significant inequities in the current DRG prospective payment system for patients in cardiology DRGs who die. Variables predictive of greater hospital resource use for cardiology patients who die include longer hospital lengths of stay and referral from another clinical service. Health policy leaders should attempt to improve the equity of cardiology DRGs regarding outcome in the future.\r"

Both these changes were highly significant. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide increased, but to a lesser extent and only effusion together with traction gave a statistically significant effect. Our study showed that joint effusion can produce hypoxia in the bone as a result of impaired blood flow to the femoral head. The application of traction increases this haemodynamic effect.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed 47 patients with neurofibromatosis and dystrophic spinal deformities; 32 of these patients had been untreated for an average of 3.6 years and in them the natural history was studied. The commonest pattern of deformity at the time of presentation was a short angular thoracic scoliosis, but with progression the angle of kyphosis also increased. Deterioration during childhood was usual but its rate was variable. Severe dystrophic changes in the apical vertebrae and in particular anterior scalloping have a poor prognosis for deterioration. The dystrophic spinal deformity of neurofibromatosis requires early surgical stabilisation which should be by combined anterior and posterior fusion if there is an abnormal angle of kyphosis or severely dystrophic apical vertebrae. Some carefully selected patients can be treated by posterior fusion and instrumentation alone.\r"

Our study strived to examine whether clinical parameters existed by which we could predict cost per DRG for peripheral vascular surgery patients. We examined all peripheral vascular surgical admissions (N = 1,169) to our academic medical center from 1/1/85-12/31/86. Patients were separated within DRGs by four clinical variables as follows: emergency room admission, surgical intensive care unit admission (ICU), infusion of plasma product or blood transfusion of a patient. The four clinical variables predicted differences per patient in hospital cost per DRG, a poorer outcome and also potential financial risk to the medical center. Within each DRG, each of these variables (either alone or in combination) predicted higher patient cost. For the ICU identifier, 88.6% of the patients who had a positive identifier had higher costs than patients in the same DRG who were not ICU admissions, for emergency admission, 81.4% of patients, and for both the transfusion (infusion of blood) and the plasma products identifier (infusion of blood products), 100% of patients. We believe that peripheral vascular surgical DRGs may be stratified by cost and outcome by these clinical variables during the patient's hospitalization. Surgeons and administrators may be able to use this methodology to segment those higher cost patients and concentrate efforts of cost containment for these groups.\r"

After a placebo stabilization phase, patients were randomized to 4 weeks of double-blind treatment with transdermal nitroglycerin, 10 or 20 cm2 (equivalent to 5 or 10 mg/24 h) (Group A); transdermal nitroglycerin, 30 or 40 cm2 (equivalent to 15 or 20 mg/24 h) (Group B), or placebo. Patches were applied at 8:00 AM and removed at 8:00 PM each day throughout the study. Treadmill testing was performed 0, 4, 8 and 12 h after patch application at baseline (day 0) and on days 1, 15 and 29. After short-term application of the transdermal patches, treadmill walking time was greater for patients in both Group A and Group B than for the placebo group at all time points tested; differences from placebo were statistically significant at 12 h for Group A and at 4, 8 and 12 h for Group B. After 2 and 4 weeks of long-term therapy, treadmill walking time was again greater for Group B than for the placebo group at all postapplication time points; differences from placebo reached statistical significance at 4 h (2 weeks) and 8 h (2 and 4 weeks). The improvement in the treadmill walking time seen over the short-term in Group A was largely lost after 4 weeks of long-term therapy. Potentially important differences in the patient characteristics of the two active treatment groups, particularly the greater use of a beta-adrenergic blocker among patients in Group A, may have contributed to these observed differences in treatment effect. An unexpected finding was the ability of the placebo group to exercise longer than either active treatment group just before patch application during long-term therapy; nonetheless, absolute responsiveness to transdermal nitroglycerin after patch application remained virtually unchanged in both active treatment groups during the 4 week treatment period. Intermittent transdermal nitroglycerin therapy was well tolerated in the vast majority of patients; nine patients experienced an increase in nonexertional angina during the patch-off periods but completed the study uneventfully.\r"

  ".W": "The ratio of peak hyperemic/basal mean coronary flow velocity, an index of coronary vasodilator reserve, immediately after coronary angioplasty normalizes in less than 50% of patients. To evaluate other indexes of coronary vasodilator capacity, both intracoronary arterial velocity and cardiac venous efflux were measured at rest and during vasodilator-induced coronary hyperemia (intracoronary nitroglycerin and papaverine) before and after angioplasty in 27 patients; 17 patients had measurements of intracoronary velocity alone and 10 had thermodilution measurements of great cardiac vein flow. Coronary flow velocity responses were also measured in 6 angiographically normal segments in patients undergoing angioplasty and in 10 normal left coronary artery segments in patients with normal coronary arteries or isolated right coronary artery disease. Despite significant angiographic (72 +/- 12 to 23 +/- 11% diameter narrowing) and hemodynamic (49 +/- 12 to 19 +/- 12 mm Hg aortocoronary gradient) improvement, coronary vasodilator reserve ratios for both arterial velocity and venous flow after angioplasty were only minimally affected. Angioplasty did not significantly increase rest coronary vein flow or artery flow velocities, but did result in significantly higher papaverine responses after angioplasty. Mean and phasic coronary velocity, diastolic coronary flow velocity integral and measured great cardiac vein flow ratios were significantly lower when compared with those in 16 angiographically normal coronary artery segments. These data indicate that maximal hyperemic coronary flow velocity is increased after angioplasty, but the reserve ratios, calculated by any of several flow velocity indexes, remain minimally improved. Angiographic correlations (percent coronary diameter, absolute diameter or cross-sectional area) with variables of coronary blood flow or velocity suggest that no single variable is useful in assessing angioplasty results. However, postangioplasty arterial mean velocity and diastolic flow velocity integral are nearly normalized in most patients, whereas relative changes remain attenuated. These findings are important in studies assessing coronary vasomotor responses in patients with atherosclerotic coronary disease, especially after angioplasty.\r"

These patterns were compared with the phase image findings in normal subjects, patients with left and right bundle branch block in the absence of pre-excitation and patients with pre-excitation through atrioventricular (AV) connections. In all patients with a Mahaim pathway, the site of earliest phase angle was septal or paraseptal. Phase progression was asymmetric and the pre-excited ventricle demonstrated the earliest mean ventricular phase angle in 10 of 11 patients. This pattern, and the associated ventricular phase difference, appeared to vary from that in normal subjects and in those with a septal AV connection, in whom phase progression is generally symmetric. Scintigraphic phase analysis provided localizing information and presented patterns consistent with Mahaim pathways. Although not able to differentiate among Mahaim pathway subtypes, these phase patterns differed from those in normal subjects, those with right and left lateral free wall pathways and most patients with a septal AV pathway. However, the phase pattern of patients with a Mahaim pathway may not differ from that of patients with a septal AV connection displaying an asymmetric pattern of phase progression, or those with left and right bundle branch block in the absence of pre-excitation. Objective, yet imperfect phase measurements supported these differences. Such image findings may complement the often complex electrophysiologic evaluation of patients presenting with pre-excitation.\r"

In addition, to study the possible reversal of drug effects by sympathetic stimulation, AV node conduction and tachycardia induction were reassessed during isoproterenol infusion (1 to 3 micrograms/min), a dose calculated to increase the rest heart rate by 25 +/- 10%. Sustained AV node reentrant tachycardia could be initiated in all 16 patients in the control state, in 2 patients after encainide and in 10 patients during isoproterenol infusion. The shortest mean atrial paced cycle length sustaining 1:1 AV conduction was 358 +/- 57 ms during the control study, which increased to 409 +/- 59 ms with encainide (p less than 0.01 versus control) and decreased to 313 +/- 31 ms during isoproterenol infusion (p less than 0.01 versus control and encainide). The shortest mean ventricular paced cycle length with 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction was 337 +/- 56 ms in the control study, 551 + 124 ms with encainide infusion (p less than 0.01 versus control) and 354 +/- 72 ms during isoproterenol infusion in the encainide-loaded state (p less than 0.01 versus both control and encainide). During a mean follow-up period of 19 +/- 10 months, significant clinical recurrences occurred in 4 of the 10 patients in whom tachycardia could still be initiated with encainide (with or without isoproterenol).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the role of vasodilator therapy in acute aortic incompetence has not been established. To investigate this, left ventricular volume overload was produced in 18 dogs by constructing a valved conduit from the descending thoracic aorta to the left ventricular apex. The time course of aortic, pulmonary and conduit flows was analyzed in eight control studies and established stability of the experimental model. In the remaining 10 dogs, intravenous nitroglycerin, titrated to reduce mean aortic blood pressure by 40%, and placebo (ethanol) were each infused for 20 min periods. Compared with placebo, nitroglycerin significantly reduced aortic flow (3,945 +/- 324 to 3,397 +/- 362 ml/min, p less than 0.01), regurgitant flow (1,304 +/- 131 to 764 +/- 90 ml/min, p less than 0.001), septal-lateral end-diastolic diameter (47.5 +/- 1.8 to 46.5 +/- 1.8 mm, p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (6.9 +/- 0.8 to 6.0 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), left ventricular stroke work (19.0 +/- 2.6 to 10.8 +/- 1.7 g-m/beat, p less than 0.001) and systemic vascular resistance (2,253 +/- 173 to 1,433 +/- 117 dyne-s/cm5, p less than 0.001). In contrast, pulmonary flow, left anterior descending coronary flow and subendocardial pH did not change during infusion of either nitroglycerin or placebo. These data indicate that by decreasing preload and afterload, and by preserving coronary flow and tissue pH, nitroglycerin effectively reduced ventricular and regurgitant volumes in the setting of acute volume overload.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cardiac tamponade was induced by instillation of 5% dextrose in water into the pericardial cavity until aortic systolic pressure was reduced by 30% to 35%. Heart rate, cardiac output and atrial, pericardial and aortic pressures were measured at 60 and 120 min of tamponade and at 5, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after decompression. Blood samples were withdrawn at the same time for the determination of atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone levels. Aortic pressure decreased significantly during tamponade and increased after decompression to near control levels. Right and left atrial pressures as well as intrapericardial pressure increased significantly during tamponade and returned to control levels after decompression. The effective transmural pressure, which was reduced during tamponade, was increased significantly at 5 min after decompression. Cardiac output was significantly reduced during tamponade and returned to pretamponade levels after decompression. Over the total experimental period, no significant changes in the levels of atrial natriuretic peptide were observed, whereas aldosterone increased significantly. It is concluded that the increased atrial pressure observed during cardiac tamponade did not stimulate the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide. Furthermore, atrial distension observed immediately after decompression was not sufficient or of long enough duration to induce measurable increases in atrial natriuretic peptide levels. Finally, the secondary hyperaldosteronism did not activate atrial natriuretic peptide secretion either during cardiac tamponade or after decompression.\r"

Expired end-tidal PCO2 and coronary perfusion pressures were measured in 15 mongrel dogs undergoing 15 min of closed chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation after a 3 min period of untreated ventricular fibrillation. In six successfully resuscitated dogs, the mean expired end-tidal PCO2 was significantly higher than that in nine nonresuscitated dogs only after 14 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (6.2 +/- 1.2 versus 3.4 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). No differences in expired end-tidal PCO2 values were found at 2, 7 or 12 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A significant decline in end-tidal PCO2 levels during the resuscitation effort was seen in the nonresuscitated group (from 6.3 +/- 0.8 to 3.4 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; p less than 0.05); the successfully resuscitated group had constant PCO2 levels throughout the 15 min of cardiac arrest (from 6.8 +/- 1.1 to 6.2 +/- 1.2 mm Hg). Changes in expired PCO2 levels during cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be a useful noninvasive predictor of successful resuscitation and survival from cardiac arrest.\r"

Two hundred twenty-nine patients had radionuclide ventriculograms at discharge for assessment of global and regional left ventricular ejection fraction. Among these 229 patients 185 had totally occluded infarct-related arteries, and angiographic reperfusion of the infarct-related artery occurred in 69% of patients treated with rt-PA and 28% of patients treated with streptokinase (p less than 0.001). Mean global left ventricular ejection fraction was not different for rt-PA-treated patients compared with streptokinase-treated patients (0.46 versus 0.45). However, the average regional ejection fraction of the regions subtended by the infarct-related artery showed a trend toward better average infarct region ejection fraction in patients treated with rt-PA than in patients treated with streptokinase (0.40 versus 0.36; 0.05 less than p less than 0.06). Analysis of data according to perfusion status of the infarct-related artery showed no difference in mean global left ventricular ejection fraction between patients with sustained versus nonsustained reperfusion (0.47 versus 0.44). However, there was better average regional ejection fraction of the region subtended by the infarct-related artery in patients with sustained reperfusion (0.40 versus 0.36; p less than 0.01). Thus, quantitation of regional left ventricular function by radionuclide techniques provides a noninvasive means for evaluating the effects of thrombolysis. This study suggests a direct relation between improvement of regional left ventricular function and the greater infarct-related artery patency rate achieved by rt-PA compared with streptokinase.\r"

One of each of the three subjects was assigned to nasal spray alone, one was assigned to astemizole alone, and one subject was assigned to both medications. Medications were started 1 week before and continued daily until 1 week after the ragweed-pollen season (6 weeks). If rhinoconjunctivitis was inadequately controlled with the trial medications, pressurized steroid nasal spray and/or antihistamine-decongestant eye drops were used in the minimum dose that would ensure relief. Nose and eye symptoms and concomitant medication use were recorded daily in a diary. Sneezing, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea were significantly better, and less additional nasal spray was used in subjects taking beclomethasone alone than in subjects taking astemizole alone. Beclomethasone plus astemizole provided no better control of rhinitis than beclomethasone alone. Eye symptoms and eye drop use tended to be less in subjects taking astemizole alone than in subjects taking beclomethasone alone, but the best control of eye symptoms was recorded in the subjects taking both trial medications. Side effects were mild or transient.\r"

  ".W": "Freshly isolated monocytes in suspension express 2000 to 4000 high affinity receptors for IFN-gamma. Because monocytes change phenotypically as they migrate out of the circulation and adhere to extracellular matrix, modulation of the expression of IFN-gamma receptors may occur. In order to determine if adherence alone modulates the receptor for IFN-gamma, we have studied receptor expression in adherent human peripheral blood monocytes. Elutriation-purified monocytes were allowed to adhere to polystyrene overnight at 37 degrees C. These cells now expressed 1 to 2 x 10(5) low affinity (Ka = 10(8) liters/M) receptors for [125I]rIFN-gamma. Binding to this receptor was specific and saturable. The expression of these receptors occurred rapidly (within 3 h) after adherence and was not inhibited by cycloheximide treatment. Binding to the receptor was abrogated by treating cells with trypsin, but was enhanced after treatment with alkaline protease or proteinase K. mAb against the high affinity receptor did not block binding to the low affinity receptor on adherent cells. The low affinity receptor transduced a signal to the cell as measured by the IFN-gamma-induced enhancement in FcR for human IgG1. The structure of the receptor on adherent cells was investigated by chemical cross-linking techniques. A receptor-[125I]rIFN-gamma complex was observed by SDS-PAGE to have a Mr of 180,000 to 200,000. Reduction of this complex with 2-ME resulted in the loss of the high Mr complex and the appearance of a doublet of lower Mr of 68,000 and 82,000. In contrast, cross-linking of monocytes in suspension yielded a complex of 110,000 to 120,000 Mr, which was unchanged upon reduction. Upon adherence, human monocytes express large numbers of a novel receptor for rIFN-gamma which is capable of stimulating the cell. This receptor appears to be composed of at least two components which are disulfide linked and structurally differs from the high affinity receptor on nonadherent monocytes.\r"

  ".U": "89176246\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently described the isolation and characterization of a set of cDNA encoding genes whose expression is induced or enhanced in murine peritoneal macrophages by treatment with LPS. In the present report we have analyzed the expression of the mRNA which hybridize with these cDNA probes in macrophages treated with other cytokines known to modulate functional activity. Three distinct patterns of expression have been documented. Two genes (D3 and C7) are inducible by LPS, IFN-gamma, and IFN-beta; D3 is comparably sensitive to all three, whereas C7 is more sensitive to LPS and IFN-gamma than to IFN-beta. The mRNA encoded by D8 is expressed in response to LPS and IFN-beta but not in response to IFN-gamma. Finally the gene encoded by D5 is inducible only in cells treated with LPS. The expression of all three cytokine-inducible mRNA was both dose and time dependent and was mediated by increased transcriptional activity of the genes. As with stimulation by LPS, the expression induced by IFN was independent of protein synthesis and occurred in a rapid and transient fashion. TNF-alpha had little or no detectable effect on any of the genes by themselves. The expression of C7, however, could be induced synergistically by treatment with a combination of TNF-alpha and either IFN-gamma of IFN-beta. The expression of these genes was not specific for macrophages as both IFN were able to induce a comparable pattern of gene expression in BALB/c 3T3 cells. Treatment of macrophages with dexamethasone inhibited LPS-induced C7 and D8 expression but did not affect that seen in response to IFN-gamma or IFN-beta, respectively. The results suggest that IFN and LPS act to modulate early gene expression by the generation of at least three overlapping but distinct signaling pathways. In some cases the pathway(s) which mediate response to LPS appear to be mechanistically distinct from those which mediate response to IFN-beta or IFN-gamma. The spectrum of stimuli and cell types which express these and other early genes suggest that they may play an important role in orchestration of the inflammatory response.\r"

  ".W": "The lateral mobilities of erythrocyte membrane proteins and terminal complement complexes (TCC) were measured on C-treated erythrocyte ghosts by the technique of fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching. Results showed that the lateral diffusion coefficient of the bulk membrane proteins decreased with the assembly of TCC on the membrane at low C dose and was significantly reduced with assembly of the full membrane attack complex (C5b-9), even in the absence of cell lysis. At high serum doses, the mobility of the membrane proteins increased slightly above that of the control cells. The diffusion coefficients of the TCC on the erythrocyte membrane range from 1.18 to 4.37 x 10(-11) cm2/s, values characteristic of anchored membrane proteins. Spectrin-depletion of the C-lysed erythrocytes results in 25- and 45-fold increases in the diffusion coefficients of the membrane proteins and the C5b-9 complex, respectively. Conversely, oxidative cross-linking of spectrin by diamide reduced the diffusion coefficients of both membrane and C proteins. These studies indicate that the deposition of TCC on an erythrocyte can result in a substantial change in the physical and structural properties of the target membrane, aside from the creation of functional lesions. The low mobilities of the terminal complexes on the target membrane suggest possible interactions with cytoskeletal elements or with anchored membrane proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships between the chemotactic factor-stimulated mobilization of calcium, activation of the NADPH-oxidase, changes in cytosolic pH, and in the level of polymerized actin in human neutrophils have been examined. The approach taken was to use intracellular calcium chelators, and pharmacologic modulators (both positive and negative) of the NADPH-oxidase to measure the aforementioned responses under conditions where the calcium transients were abrogated and/or the generation of superoxide anions was either inhibited or augmented. The decrease in cytosolic pH induced by chemoattractants was inhibited by the calcium chelator BAPTA and by the diglyceride kinase inhibitor 6-[2-(4-[(4-fluorophenyl)phenylmethylene]-1-piperidinylethyl ]-7-methyl-5H-thiazolo[3,2-alpha]pyriimidin-5-one (R59022) (this latter compound enhanced the oxidative response of the cells). Furthermore, a specific inhibitor of the NADPH-oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium) had no significant effect on the cytosolic acidification induced by FMLP or leukotriene B4. These results indicate that the initiation of the cytosolic acidification induced by chemotactic factors is a calcium-dependent event that is not directly linked to the activation of the NADPH-oxidase. In contrast, the stimulated polymerization of actin was insensitive to BAPTA, R59022, and diphenyleneiodonium. Thus, neither the calcium transients nor the oxidative burst play a signaling role in the initiation of actin polymerization elicited by chemoattractants. These data indicate that additional investigations are needed to uncover the biochemical basis of the signals initiated in human neutrophils by chemotactic factors that lead to the polymerization of actin and to the cytosolic acidification.\r"

  ".W": "Submucosal glands are the major sources of airway secretions in most mammals. Mast cells are abundant in the environment of airway submucosal glands and are rich sources of secreted proteases. To investigate the hypothesis that mast cell proteases stimulate airway gland secretion, we studied the ability of the two major mast cell granule proteases, chymase and tryptase, to cause secretion of 35S-labeled macromolecules from a line of cultured bovine airway gland serous cells. Mast cell chymase and tryptase were purified from dog mastocytoma cells. Chymase markedly stimulated serous cell secretion in a concentration-dependent fashion with a threshold of 10(-10) M, whereas tryptase had no effect. The response to 10(-8) M chymase (1530 +/- 80% over base line) was approximately 10-fold higher than that evoked by other agonists such as histamine and isoproterenol. The predominant 35S-labeled macromolecule released by chymase was chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, the glycoconjugate present in serous cell secretory granules. The response to chymase was non-cytotoxic and was blocked by active site inhibitors of chymase (soybean trypsin inhibitor and chymostatin) and by inhibitors of cellular energy metabolism (azide,2,4-dinitrophenol, dicumarol). Supernatant obtained by degranulation of mastocytoma cells caused a secretory response of comparable magnitude to that caused by chymase. These findings demonstrate that chymase, but not tryptase, is a potent secretagogue for airway gland serous cells, and they suggest a possible role for chymase-containing mast cells in the pathogenesis of airway hypersecretion.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms of Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis of immune complexes were investigated by the use of a murine macrophage-like cell line (P388D1) and murine peritoneal resident macrophages. About 40 to 80% of P388D1 cells phagocytosed SRBC coated with IgG2a subclass anti-SRBC mAb (EA2a) within 60 min, whereas only 10 to 20% of the cells phagocytosed EA2b during the same period. The treatment of P388D1 cells with inhibitors of phospholipase A2 (p-bromophenacylbromide, EGTA, or dexamethasone) or of cyclooxygenase (indomethacin or aspirin) significantly promoted the Fc gamma 2bR-mediated phagocytosis of EA2b, but did not affect the Fc gamma 2aR-mediated phagocytosis of EA2a. These results suggest that the activation of phospholipase A2 activity associated with Fc gamma 2bR may lead to the inhibition of phagocytosis of EA2b. This inhibition appeared to be due to the blockade of the interaction of Fc gamma 2bR with various cytoskeletal components, because the association of Fc gamma 2bR and these cytoskeletal components, which could be eliminated by cytochalasin D, was found to be increased by the inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity.\r"

As previously reported, T lymphocytes in PBMC preparations from schistosomiasis patients (but not control subjects who have never been infected) proliferate when cultured in the presence of certain of these anti-SEA purified antibodies. We now show that PBMC from most patients with chronic schistosomiasis, regardless of the clinical form of their infection, respond to anti-SEA antibodies from sera of asymptomatic (intestinal) or hepatointestinal patients. In stark contrast, none responds to anti-SEA antibodies purified from sera of acute or hepatosplenic patients. All of these multiclonal anti-SEA antibody preparations were active in anti-SEA ELISA assays and gave comparable patterns of reactivity with SEA upon immunoblotting analysis. Immunization of rabbits with some of these anti-SEA antibody preparations, followed by absorption of the rabbit antisera on absorbents of normal Ig, produced specific anti-Id reagents. Use of these reagents in competitive ELISA systems demonstrated that the Id in stimulatory and nonstimulatory anti-SEA antibody preparations differ with regard to the proportion of the serologically defined Id expressed by each. It appears possible to screen patients' plasmas for the presence of shared Id by use of suitable Id/anti-Id competitive ELISA assays. Taken together these data indicate that only certain Id-positive preparations are stimulatory to patients' PBMC, and the expression of these T cell stimulatory, immunoregulatory Id on anti-SEA antibodies correlates with the clinical form of a patient's infection.\r"

  ".W": "The antibody response to Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide (Hib-PS) is pauciclonal but can vary between different individuals. To estimate the size of this antibody repertoire we examined the constant and V regions of human IgG anti-Hib antibodies from 14 individuals at the clonal level using various serologic and IEF methods. Examination of H chains showed that 11 of 14 individuals produced both IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies, two individuals produced only IgG2 and one individual produced only IgG1 antibody. All 14 individuals produced kappa-containing antibody clones and three persons also produced significant lambda-containing antibody clones. V region heterogeneity was examined by comparing cross-reactivity of anti-Hib-PS antibodies to the capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K100 carbohydrate (K100 CHO). These studies showed that clones of IgG anti-Hib-PS antibodies cross-reactive with K100 CHO were present in 5 of 14 (36%) individuals and also revealed at least three types of V regions among these antibodies. The first type has no cross-reaction with K100 CHO and was found in 13 of the 14 individuals. The second type, found in three of 14 individuals, cross-reacts with K100 CHO and uses a lambda L chain V region. The third type, found in 2 of 14 individuals, cross-reacts with K100 CHO and uses a kappa L chain V region. Although the lambda type V region was found only in association with IgG2, the other two V region types associate with both IgG1 and IgG2. Thus, five IgG antibody clones are serologically discernable. An individual generally responds to Hib-PS by expressing several clones selected from these discernable antibody clones. Indeed, we can observe six individual response patterns among these 14 individuals and conclude that considerable variability in individual responses to Hib-PS can be achieved with very few V regions.\r"

Immunizations of Lou/M rats performed with this IgE (Ab1) induced the production of antiidiotypic antibodies (Ab2). Moreover, after this Ab2 production, anti-antiidiotypic antibodies (Ab3) were revealed. The screening of Ab3 isotypes showed the presence of IgG Ab3 and more interestingly of IgE Ab3, i.e., the same isotype as Ab1. These IgE and IgG antibodies recognized predominantly the 26-kDa Ag and were cytotoxic for schistosomula in the presence of platelets for IgE Ab3 and eosinophils for IgG Ab3. Both IgE and IgG Ab3 conferred by passive transfer protective immunity to infected rats (up to 50%). Thus the immunization with an IgE mAb led in part to the production of Ab3 of the same isotype as Ab1. In conclusion, these results suggest that the isotype selection of the antibodies of the third generation (Ab3) might be influenced by the Ab1. The respective role of the idiotope and isotype of Ab1 in isotype regulation is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We have used synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to human VH sequences to analyze sequence variation in human genomic DNA. By using probes 20 to 24 bp long and conditions of hybridization and washing under which identity in 17 to 21 consecutive bp is required for hybridization, it has been possible to dramatically reduce the complexity of hybridization patterns. We have been able to identify unambiguously individual VH elements. Concomitant with the reduction in overall complexity of hybridization patterns has been a marked increase in the variation between hybridization patterns when different individuals are compared. Variation between individuals was detected using probes corresponding to both framework and complementarity determining regions and depended in part on the complexity of the corresponding VH gene family. Probes corresponding to a cDNA clone belonging to the single-member VH6 family, hybridized to a single, invariant, band in all individuals tested. An oligonucleotide probe corresponding to CDR2 of one member of the VH3 family also detected a single, invariant, band in all individuals tested. However, an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to framework region 2 revealed variants of more than 40% of the 22 VH elements it detects. In addition, a panel of 5 oligonucleotide probes corresponding to a second member of the VH3 family revealed variants of 10 of 14 elements detected. The patterns of variation suggest that some VH elements have multiple alleles, whereas some elements are remarkably conserved. The number of variant elements we have detected is evidence that the haplotype arrangement of the human VH locus is probably extremely complex. Importantly, this heterogeneity may contribute directly to disease susceptibility in man.\r"

A patient-control study showed patients were more likely than controls to have had an ill family member and to have used antidiarrheal medication during the month before their illness. Diet histories showed patients were significantly more likely to have eaten ice cream or salami than were controls, and to have shopped at one grocery store chain. Subtyping of L. monocytogenes isolates of patients showed no predominant strain, and cultures of food products eaten by patients were negative except for Brie cheese eaten by one patient. With no predominant strain of L. monocytogenes in the patients, a common source for this outbreak is unlikely. Thus, the identified risk factors may have been associated with carriage of L. monocytogenes and a coinfecting organism may have precipitated disseminated disease. Possible cofactors should be considered in investigations of future outbreaks of listeriosis.\r"

  ".W": "A representative collection of meningococci was isolated from cases and healthy carriers in The Gambia between 1982 and 1988, during and after an epidemic of meningococcal meningitis. These bacteria were subjected to a clonal analysis. All serogroup A bacteria from both cases and carriers were of one clone (A IV-1). Several unrelated clones were observed among serogroup 29E and serogroup Y carrier strains. The serogroup A strains were uniform for serotype and subtype antigens (serotype 4, subtype P1.7) and antibiotic sensitivity pattern. Occasional strains varied in their lipopolysaccharide (LPS), DNA fingerprint pattern, and/or the quantitative expression of the class 1 protein. A high degree of strain-specific variation was found for the expression of class 5 proteins, pili, and sulfonamide sensitivity. The frequency of strains expressing reduced amounts of the class 1 protein, altered LPS, and/or increased amounts of capsular polysaccharide rose among case strains obtained after the epidemic had ceased. These strains seem to be generally resistant to antibody-mediated bactericidal activity.\r"

IGIV alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. When these bacteria were preopsonized in IGIV, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. The in vitro opsonic activity of IGIV for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by the IGIV-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, P less than .05). The in vivo protective efficacy of IGIV also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, P less than .001). Antibodies to FcRlo (Leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in IGIV but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific IgM. Both CR1 and CR3 receptors on PMNLs were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.\r"

A patient with autopsy-proved primary amyloidosis developed renal failure requiring peritoneal dialysis. Purpura and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were first observed 3 years later, after treatment was changed from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis. Plasma contained a time-dependent factor VIII:C inhibitor. The inhibitor on isoelectric focusing showed two peaks of activity, one with an isoelectric point (pl) of approximately 4 and the second larger, with a pl of approximately 8. Both were neutralized only by antisera to IgA and kappa light chain. A monoclonal antibody prepared in Balb/c mice against the variable region of the kappa light chain also blocked the inhibitor. The delayed onset of the coagulopathy could be explained by the change from peritoneal to hemodialysis, because in the former, significant amounts of the paraprotein, indicated by an \"M-spike,\" were recovered in the dialysate. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the first 20 amino acids of the variable region of the kappa light chain from the urinary protein and the splenic amyloid subunit showed identity.\r"

An intact lipoxygenase pathway, and the synthesis of leukotriene C4 (LTC4), which requires reduced glutathione, is essential for in vitro growth of normal myeloid progenitors (CFU-GM). We tested the effects of nordihydroguiaretic acid (NDGA) and caffeic acid (CA), inhibitors of lipoxygenase; buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which inhibits glutathione synthesis; and Acivicin, a glutamine antagonist, on these cell lines and compared the effects with those seen on CFU-GM. In semisolid culture, all three cell lines were inhibited by NDGA, CA, and BSO in a dose-dependent manner similar to that in CFU-GM but were relatively resistant to Acivicin. In liquid culture, all three cell lines exhibited relative resistance to inhibition by both BSO and Acivicin, with KG-1 also demonstrating relative resistance to inhibition by NDGA and CA. The inhibition of HL-60 by CA could be completely reversed by the addition of exogenous leukotriene D4. The dependence on the lipoxygenase pathway may be altered to varying degrees in different leukemic lines and may depend on culture conditions. Whether these changes may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemia or merely represent secondary metabolic changes is yet to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Current studies show a more than 50-fold variation in the estimated level of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity in normal resting blood samples that result from major differences in the methods used to sample, preserve, and assay t-PA activity in blood. In this study we developed optimized methods for stabilizing and measuring t-PA activity in plasma by using a coupled plasminogen-chromogenic substrate (amidolytic) assay. To maximize the recovery of t-PA activity, blood should be acidified within 60 seconds after being drawn by adding 2 parts whole blood to 1 part 0.5 mol/L sodium acetate, pH 4.2. This method prevents hemolysis and eliminates 70% of the alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor. Optimum conditions for measuring t-PA activity are pH 8.0 to 8.3 (37 degrees C), ionic strength 0.02 to 0.04, 0.5 mumol/L plasminogen, 80 micrograms/ml CNBr-cleaved fibrinogen, and a chromogenic substrate concentration of 0.65 mmol/L D-valyl-leucyl-lysyl-p-nitroanilide, 0.25 mmol/L D-valyl-phenylalanyl-lysyl-p-nitroanilide, or 0.2 mmol/L D-norleucyl-hexahydrotyrosyl-lysyl-p-nitroanilide. The final assay is linear with respect to added one-chain t-PA, two-chain t-PA, and acidified plasma. There was no difference in t-PA activity measured with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid anticoagulant versus that measured with citrate anticoagulant after correction for dilution effects (average resting t-PA activity in plasma from 20 healthy individuals = 1.59 IU/ml). We conclude that assay conditions can have major effects on the measurement of t-PA activity in plasma and that suboptimal conditions may result in a significant underestimation of t-PA activity.\r"

The ABL300 measures pH, carbon dioxide tension, and oxygen tension on 85-microliters samples by using specific electrodes, and estimates hemoglobin concentration from the optical density of a nonhemolyzed sample. From these it calculates bicarbonate, standard bicarbonate, total carbon dioxide, base excess, standard base excess, and oxygen saturation and content. The electrodes are automatically calibrated by pumping bicarbonate/phosphate buffer solutions, gas-equilibrated within the thermostatic chamber, into the measuring cuvettes. Samples are preheated in metal tubing before being pumped automatically into the measuring chamber. An open liquid junction to a half-saturated potassium chloride solution is renewed with each sample to complete the pH circuit. The electrodes are housed in a 37 degrees C circulated-air thermostat, which also contains the equilibrators for the calibration solutions. Two known carbon dioxide mixtures are made from pure carbon dioxide by dilution with room air, which is compressed continuously, avoiding the use of premixed calibration gases. The computer determines the derived variables and can correct pH, carbon dioxide tension, and oxygen tension values to a user-defined body temperature. Corrections are made for predicted discrepancy between the measured and true value caused by the small sample size. The corrections depend on the difference in gas tension between sample and rinse solution.\r"

  ".U": "89177513\r", 
  ".W": "The pathophysiological potential of mediator substances in manifestations of secondary brain damage is attracting increased attention. This is particularly true of the excitatory transmitters glutamate and arachidonic acid. Noxious properties of these compounds in central nervous tissue have been demonstrated. The current study was performed to determine whether glutamate and arachidonate are released in brain tissue secondary to focal trauma. For this purpose, a cold injury of exposed cerebral cortex was induced in cats. Marked accumulation of glutamate was observed in interstitially drained edema fluid, reaching 10 to 15 times the level that was assessed in normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prior to trauma. The extracellular release of glutamate was further dramatically enhanced by a critical decrease of the cerebral perfusion pressure due to a malignant increase of intracranial pressure. Under these conditions, glutamate concentrations 1000 to 1500 times normal levels accumulated in vasogenic edema fluid, demonstrating a relationship between the extent of the release of glutamate in damaged brain and the severity of the insult. Although under normal conditions glutamate concentrations in plasma were considerably higher than in the interstitial fluid, the pronounced increase of glutamate in this compartment due to trauma cannot be explained by transport of the compound together with the plasma-like edema from the intravascular space. Corresponding findings were obtained for free fatty acid concentrations in edema fluid. Almost all fatty acids that were studied had a significantly higher concentration in edema fluid than in normal CSF obtained as a control prior to trauma. However, contrary to the findings for glutamate, fatty acid concentrations in edema fluid were lower than in plasma. Accumulation of fatty acids in vasogenic edema fluid might, therefore, have resulted from uptake of the material together with edema fluid through the breached blood-brain barrier. Arachidonic acid was an exception. Its concentrations were significantly higher in edema fluid than in plasma, suggesting that it was released from cerebral parenchyma as the underlying mechanism of its extracellular accumulation. The current observations provide further support for a mediator function of glutamate and arachidonic acid in acute traumatic lesions of the brain. Quantitative assessment of the release of highly active mediator substances in brain tissue may facilitate analysis of the therapeutic efficiency of specific treatment aimed at interfering with the release or pathological function of mediators of secondary brain damage.\r"

  ".W": "Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been shown to decrease mortality and to increase the rate of recovery in head-injured patients. However, a recent short-term animal experiment has raised concern over the potential enhancement of vasogenic edema by TPN. The experiment described here was undertaken to examine longer-term effects of TPN infusion on vasogenic edema development. Twenty-four rats received an infusion of a TPN solution (35% glucose) or 0.9% saline at 4 ml/kg/hr for 4 or 26 hours following cold injury. In the 4-hour experiment, TPN increased the serum glucose level to 772 +/- 57 mg/dl compared to 160 +/- 14 mg/dl in the saline-treated animals (p = 0.0001) and increased serum osmolality to 312 +/- 3 mOsm/kg compared to 291 +/- 3 mOsm/kg in the saline-treated group (p = 0.0006). In the 26-hour experiment, TPN-infused rats were also hyperglycemic and hyperosmotic by 4 hours postinjury and remained hyperglycemic at 26 hours postinjury (serum glucose level 374 +/- 97 mg/dl compared to 141 +/- 3 mg/dl in saline-treated animals; p = 0.0371). Although by 26 hours the TPN-infused rats appeared hyperosmotic compared to the saline-treated rats, high variability in the TPN group prevented statistical confirmation of this observation (serum osmolality 337 +/- 35 mOsm/kg in the TPN group compared to 287 +/- 6 mOsm/kg in the saline group). A three-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to analyze the effect of infusion (saline vs. TPN), time (4 vs. 26 hours), and cold injury on the specific gravity of the five brain regions studied. Cold injury significantly increased edema development in the injured versus uninjured hemisphere for every region studied (p less than or equal to 0.0034, all five regions), and edema development increased significantly between 4 and 26 hours in three of the five regions (p less than or equal to 0.0207, all three regions). The infusion fluid was not a significant factor in any of the analyses. In conclusion, TPN infusion produced hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality in cold-injured rats but did not enhance vasogenic edema development in any brain region studied.\r"

Ten patients between 2 and 18 years of age underwent intubation on 20 occasions. Mechanical ventilation was maintained for a mean of 2 days. Positive end-expiratory pressure was introduced in the recovery phase to prevent hypoxemia. Twelve episodes (Group 1) involved intubation less than 48 hours; in eight episodes (group 2) the patients required ventilatory support greater than 48 hours. The two groups did not differ in regard to age, pharmacologic therapy, preintubation arterial blood gas data, or initial ventilator settings, but the rise in pH and fall in Paco2 differed significantly over the first 12 hours of therapy. In the group 2 patients, peak pressures were not increased greater than 60 cm H2O despite elevated Paco2 values, and aggressive sodium bicarbonate therapy for pH correction was not pursued. Complications were few and all patients survived. We conclude that asthma patients have variable resolution of airway obstruction during mechanical ventilation and that controlled hypoventilation can be a safe therapy for the patients with more severe obstruction.\r"

Two of six patients with moderately severe disease (not hydropic but requiring exchange transfusion) had neutropenia; all six had thrombocytopenia. Of nine patients with mild disease (not treated with exchange transfusions), two had neutropenia but none had thrombocytopenia. The mean platelet volume was low or normal (7.5 +/- 0.2 ft) in the patients with thrombocytopenia, and the neutropenia was not accompanied by a \"left shift\" (ratio of immature to total neutrophils 0.26 +/- 0.03, mean +/- SEM). In two severely affected patients, erythroid progenitor levels were elevated and their proliferative rates (tritiated thymidine suicide) were increased, whereas their granulocyte-macrophage progenitor levels and the proliferative rates of those progenitors were diminished. In a severely affected patient, the in vitro maturation of multipotent progenitors was altered, with production of a greater than normal proportion of normoblasts (p less than 0.01) but fewer neutrophils (p less than 0.02) and megakaryocytes (p less than 0.03). It appears that the marked increase in erythropoiesis in fetuses with Rh hemolytic disease can be accompanied by a down-modulation of neutrophil and platelet production.\r"

Using our previously reported porcine model of Pseudomonas-induced respiratory failure, we examined the therapeutic effects of a vasodilating prostaglandin, PGE1, and a reversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen. Forty-two animals were randomized to seven groups: I--ibuprofen; II--PGE1; III--ibuprofen + PGE1; IV--Pseudomonas + ibuprofen; V--Pseudomonas + PGE1; VI--Pseudomonas + ibuprofen + PGE1; VII--Pseudomonas. Ibuprofen significantly improved pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary hypertension, and hypoxemia, as well as increased survival slightly. PGE1 had no effect on pulmonary dysfunction, but prevented the rise in systemic vascular resistance that occurred in untreated, infected animals and animals treated with ibuprofen alone. Combination therapy improved stroke volume index, a measure of nonpulmonary organ function.\r"

Following a 30% body surface area full-thickness open-flame burn, rats exhibited a short period (3 to 4 days) of anorexia followed by a more prolonged (several weeks) hyperphagic-hypermetabolic response. During this hypermetabolic period, norepinephrine concentrations were increased in the brain and circulating epinephrine levels were elevated. Depletion of brain norepinephrine using 6-hydroxydopamine led to increased body weight gain, but did not increase resting energy expenditure in burned rats. Similarly, the reduction of circulating catecholamines through removal of the adrenal medulla resulted in a decreased loss of body weight and only slight reductions in resting energy expenditure. Therefore, these results suggest that although brain norepinephrine and circulating epinephrine have a role in the full expression of hypermetabolism, these compounds do not appear to be major mediators of this response to burn trauma.\r"

We discovered that the T cells expressed normal amounts of functional lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, but the keratinocytes did not express significant levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, which was probably due to the inability of the malignant T cells to produce gamma interferon. These results support the concept that the inability of malignant T cells to enter the epidermis may contribute to emergence of more clinically aggressive T-cell clones that are no longer confined to the skin, but infiltrate the blood, lymph nodes, and viscera, as is seen in Sezary syndrome.\r"

These changes correlated with intestinal remnant length and carbohydrate absorption. Carbohydrate absorption correlated with polyamine levels in a single patient studied longitudinally. The polyamine content of intestinal fluid may serve as a marker of the status of the intestinal mucosa and may prove useful in the dietary management of individuals with the short bowel syndrome.\r"

Eighty-two quantitative enteral feeding cultures and clinical data were obtained during 8 days of observation on each of 33 patients. Cultures of appropriate sites were obtained on febrile patients and compared to the enteral feeding culture. Gram negative bacilli (GNB) in the enteral feeding correlated with abdominal distension in the patients (10 of 12 patients with GNB compared to 5 of 21 without GNB; p less than 0.01). Nine of the 10 patients with GNB and distension were receiving systemic antimicrobics to which the organism was resistant. Contamination of feeding with Serratia marcescens correlated with cultures for the same organism in patients' other body sites (p less than 0.01). The feeding contaminant may have been the source of sepsis in one patient who expired from septic shock. No relationship was demonstrated between contamination and liquid stools or fever. Undiluted, canned feedings were significantly less contaminated at 24 hr (15%) than those requiring mixing of powder (94%) (p less than 0.0001). The canned feedings grew primarily enteric organisms, whereas the powder feedings grew flora typically resident on the skin. Mixing or diluting feedings appears to represent an increased risk of contamination. Growth of GNB may produce adverse effects. Further investigation into methods to limit contamination and growth is warranted.\r"

Thereafter there was sporadic growth of different organisms but never increasing growth during the 7 days of infusion. In the second study, systems with Ensure were initially contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and reused for 5 days. S. aureus was eliminated by rinsing, but E. coli persisted in the delivery system at concentrations of 10(3)-10(6) CFU/ml. We conclude that clean enteral nutrition systems can be rinsed after short-infusion periods and reused up to 7 days in vitro without significant contamination; however, once a bag has become heavily contaminated some bacteria cannot be eradicated from the system by rinsing.\r"

The animals received intravenously for 4 days a mixture of Intralipid 10% and Vamine-Glucose. At the end of TPN, oral feeding was reinstituted and the rats were fed with an isocaloric standard diet (60% carbohydrate, 17% protein, 3% lipid). Sucrase, isomaltase, lactase, and aminopeptidase N activities were measured at the end of TPN and at 1, 3, and 5 days after TPN. Sham-operated rats nourished orally with the standard diet were used as controls. In both intestinal segments, lactase activity showed no significant changes at the end of TPN or during oral realimentation. Isomaltase, and especially sucrase activities, exhibited an important drop at the end of TPN. After TPN, a complete restoration of isomaltase and sucrase activities was obtained in the jejunum only. During oral refeeding a 40% deficit in sucrase activity persisted in the ileum throughout the experimental period, whereas normal isomaltase activity was restored in this segment. Aminopeptidase N activity was lowered by TPN and recovered normal values within a few hours after oral realimentation. Thus, reinstitution of oral feeding after TPN should take into account that the intestine is capable of digesting normal amounts of dietary protein but has a reduced tolerance for carbohydrates.\r"

Serum amino acids were determined on day 1 immediately before administrating PN, and on day 5 during PN. Trauma patients on F080 exhibited higher levels of alanine, aspartate, asparagine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, total branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and total essential amino acids than those on FreAmine II; in contrast septic children showed similar levels of serum amino acids on both PN solutions. BCAA were lower in septics than in trauma patients, probably as a consequence of an increased utilization of these amino acids in sepsis because of the higher organ protein synthesis typical of this situation. The phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio was found elevated both in septic and trauma children, but it decreased after PN in the latter when using an enriched BCAA solution. Utilization of this solution, partly corrects the metabolic disturbances induced by stress, but the metabolical responses induced either by sepsis or trauma are partially different which may have important implications for patient care.\r"

Recommendations are to use nonpolyvinyl chloride (PVC) containers for admixture of these solutions. PVC is a hard, brittle, and inflexible substance, and plasticizers, predominantly diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), are added to impart flexibility. DEHP is a lipid soluble suspected carcinogen, hepatotoxin, and teratogen which has been shown to leach from PVC products containing lipophilic admixtures. The purpose of this study was to quantitate the amount of DEHP which leaches from PVC bags containing TNS. Six study groups, which contained three formulas stored at 25 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C +/- 1 degree C, were assayed for DEHP at time 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hr, 1 wk, and 3 wk using high-performance liquid chromatography. The control group contained an amino acid source, a carbohydrate source, and standard electrolytes, and the other groups contained a 10% lipid source or a 20% lipid source in addition to the constituents of the control group. Lipid-containing groups demonstrated detectable levels of DEHP at 48 hr, and DEHP content increased in these groups throughout the 21-day study.

Our results indicate that vancomycin was stable and was delivered with loss in concentration of less than 5% with and without storage under refrigeration. This study suggests an alternative method for delivering vancomycin when treating a catheter-related infection. If vancomycin is delivered in this fashion, less manipulations of the line would be required. In addition, there may be a theoretical advantage of constantly bathing the catheter with vancomycin when the catheter is suspected of harboring the infecting organism.\r"

The NSS Medicare patients fell into 98 diagnostic related groups (DRGs). All 3,939 Medicare patients admitted in 1985 with the same DRGs as the NSS patients were also identified and their financial data analyzed. The NSS patients lost $999,643 because of the 266 medicare reimbursed NSS patients sustained high losses which overwhelmed the modest profits of the 269 non-Medicare patients. When data from all Medicare patients (which includes both NSS and non-NSS patients) with the same DRGs are analyzed, large profits are realized. These profits are totally due to pass-through payments received. Without pass throughs the loss for all 3,939 Medicare patients in these 98 DRGs would have been $1,641,273. The impact of eliminating pass throughs in the next few years needs to be determined. NSS patients represent a group that generates high financial losses under the federal prospective reimbursement system. However, present Medicare reimbursement of other less seriously ill patients with similar DRGs more than compensate these losses if pass throughs are used in determining reimbursements.\r"

Similar results were obtained when feeding tube patency was restored in eight in vitro occluded feeding tubes (Dobbhoff, French size 8) by using first Pepsi (two/eight successful) and then Viokase in pH 7.9 (six/six successful). We also report our experience in the first 10 patients with occluded feeding tubes using this Viokase solution injected through a Drum catheter into the feeding tube. In seven patients, this method proved to be successful, and the reasons for failure in three patients include a knotted tube, impacted tablet powder, and a formula clot fo 24 hr duration and 45 cm in length.\r"

The indwelling devices potentiate platelet-fibrin thrombi formation, providing a nidus for infection. Although many episodes of sepsis associated with thrombotic tunnelled catheters respond to antimicrobial therapy alone, a significant number require catheter removal. Evidence from case studies and small clinical trials suggests that fibrinolytic agents may increase the response rate and prevent removal of the device when combined with antimicrobial therapy. We present the first case reported of bacterial sepsis secondary to a thrombotic indwelling Hickman catheter for long-term TPN successfully treated with a combination of streptokinase and antibiotic therapies.\r"

These findings suggest a substantial fall in mitochondrial oxidative capacity in ageing muscle, which may contribute to reduced exercise capacity in elderly people. Mitochondrial respiratory failure may contribute to the ageing process in other organs.\r"

Since a gas is a good insulator of heat, CO2 may be a better medium for laser recanalization. To study this possibility, a metal-capped fiber was positioned in a segment of blood-filled polyethylene tubing and activated with an argon laser. Probe temperatures were measured in blood and as the blood was displaced by flowing CO2 gas. Probe temperatures were higher at all powers studied in CO2 gas than in blood. Maximum probe temperatures averaged 518 +/- 24 degrees C after CO2 infusion versus 320 +/- 7 degrees C in blood, (P less than 0.0001). Blood aggregate formation was noted on the probe surface in blood but not in CO2 medium. Thus CO2 gas may be a preferable medium for laser recanalization, since higher probe temperatures are achieved, and the probe surface remains free of insulating blood coagulate.\r"

Thus, nine children with mild or moderate asthma (aged 10-15 yr) and nine normal children (aged 11-16 yr) were studied during an incremental load exercise with a cyclic ergometer, the load of which was increased by steps of 30 W.3 min-1. During the 3rd min of each workload, we measured the following parameters: O2 consumption (VO2), CO2 production (VCO2), ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), respiratory frequency (f), ratio of inspiratory to total time of respiratory cycle (T1/TTOT), mean inspiratory flow (VT/T1) as well as mouth occlusion pressure measured at 100 ms (P0.1), and inspiratory power for breathing (W). At maximum level, the two groups showed identical values for heart rate, ventilation divided by weight (VEBW), T1/TTOT), VT/T1, P0.1, and W. However, asthmatic children had lower maximal power (P less than 0.02), higher tidal volume divided by weight (VTBW) (P less than 0.05), and lower f (P less than 0.01). At a same level of exercise (60, 90, or 120 W), in both groups, we found identical values for P0.1, VEBW, VO2, T1/TTOT, and VTBW/T1. However, asthmatic patients exhibited higher VTBW and lower f(limit of significance). This resulted from higher inspiratory and total time durations. Furthermore, they showed a higher inspiratory power for breathing. It was the same for f and VTBW if the results were expressed in relation to the VO2 in ml.kg-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two SCI groups performed wheelchair ergometry (WCE) 20 min three times per week for 8 wk. Low-intensity (LI, N = 6) and moderate-intensity (MI, N = 5) groups trained at 50-60% and 70-80% maximal heart rate reserve (HRR), respectively. The subjects completed an incremental discontinuous maximal WCE test to exhaustion pre- and post-training. A submaximal WCE test consisting of 4-min exercise stages at power outputs of 5, 10, and 15 W was also performed pre- and post-training. Blood samples were collected before and after training and analyzed for total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). The TC/HDL-C ratio was calculated. Both groups exhibited no significant changes (P greater than 0.10) in VO2max, HRmax, POmax, lactate (La)max, and VO2 at 4 mmol [La]. No pre- to post-training differences were recorded in the LI group for submaximal VO2, HR, VE, La, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). The MI group had significantly lower (P less than or equal to 0.10) post-training submaximal HR, La, and RPE and no changes in VO2 or VE. Blood lipid levels remained unaltered in the LI group, while the MI group exhibited significant increases in HDL-C and decreases in TG, LDL-C, and the TC/HDL-C ratio. The maximal test data revealed that 8 wk of LI and MI wheelchair ergometry training did not improve VO2max in SCI persons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations significantly increased in response to G and S feeding. The high plasma insulin values resulted in a significant transient reduction in plasma glucose concentration in the first hour of exercise and blunted the response of plasma free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations, when compared to the values observed with F ingestion, which did not modify plasma glucose or insulin concentrations. Over the 2 h exercise period, the percentages of exogenous G (67 +/- 9%) and S (73 +/- 8%) oxidized were not significantly different but were significantly higher than the percentage of exogenous F oxidized (54 +/- 6%). These results confirm that 1) exogenous F is less readily available for oxidation than G or S and 2) pure corn starch does not offer any advantage over glucose as a pre-exercise meal.\r"

The ejection fraction was identical (58 +/- 12 percent) in both groups. The end-systolic volume was 61 +/- 29 ml in the streptokinase group and 66 +/- 31 ml in the rt-PA group (P not significant). Patency rates at three weeks for the infarct-related artery were also similar (75 percent in the streptokinase group and 76 percent in the rt-PA group). Reinfarction rates at 30 days were the same (5 percent) in both groups. One patient had a fatal intracerebral hemorrhage 13 hours after receiving rt-PA, and another had a fatal cerebellar hemorrhage 21 hours after receiving rt-PA for reinfarction nine days after treatment with streptokinase. An intention-to-treat analysis revealed that mortality at 30 days was 3.7 percent in the rt-PA group as compared with 7.4 percent in the streptokinase group (P greater than 0.2). Follow-up for a mean of 9.0 months revealed no significant difference in survival; we observed 12 deaths (8.9 percent) in the streptokinase group and 8 deaths (5.9 percent) in the rt-PA group (P = 0.34). We conclude that rt-PA and streptokinase, in the doses given, have similar effects on left ventricular function after a first myocardial infarction. Because of the small number of deaths, it is not possible to determine whether their effects on mortality are similar.\r"

Family and population studies indicate that predisposition is probably polygenic. At least one susceptibility gene lies within the major histocompatibility complex and is closely linked to the genes encoding the class II antigens, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ (refs 3, 4). Fine mapping of susceptibility genes by linkage analysis in families is not feasible because of infrequent recombination (linkage disequilibrium) between the DR and DQ genes. Recombination events in the past, however, have occurred and generated distinct DR-DQ haplotypes, whose frequencies vary between races. DNA sequencing and oligonucleotide dot-blot analysis of class II genes from two race-specific haplotypes indicate that susceptibility to IDDM is closely linked to the DQA1 locus and suggest that both the DQB1 (ref. 7) and DQA1 genes contribute to disease predisposition.\r"

The Fos/Jun complex binds to a specific symmetrical DNA recognition sequence (termed TRE), thus stimulating transcription of the respective gene. Here, we show that two distinct regions in Fos are required for the formation of a Fos/Jun/TRE complex. These are the leucine zipper, involved in the association with Jun, and a directly adjacent basic region. Specific amino-acid substitutions in this basic, presumably alpha-helical, region abolish the interaction of Fos/Jun with the TRE but not the association of the two proteins. The functionally crucial amino acids are located in a region of Fos which is structurally similar to the putative DNA-binding sites in Jun and in the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4 (refs 15 and 16).\r"

High-resolution digital subtraction radiography was used to localize clots intracranially at the carotid bifurcation. Circulation through the internal carotid artery and intracranial vessels was monitored with serial digital subtraction angiography before and after embolization and during treatment. Disappearance of the tin marker on the digital subtraction radiograph indicated dissolution of clot and was associated with reestablishment of circulation on the digital subtraction angiogram. Experimental animals were treated with human-specific recombinant TPA 30 minutes, 2 hours, or 4 hours after clot embolization. TPA was administered as an intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/h for 2 hours. Digital subtraction angiograms were performed every 30 minutes. All clots dissolved, and cerebral circulation was reestablished within 120 minutes of treatment. In control animals treated with saline, embolized clots were stable, and the internal carotid artery remained occluded. At the completion of each study, the animal was perfused with freshly prepared, buffered 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) for demarcation of cerebral infarction. Control animals demonstrated infarction of 50 +/- 3.6% of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, with an infarct weight of 2.1 +/- 0.2 g.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty percent of children had a history of seizures and 70% had either learning disabilities or mental retardation. Overall, 74% had an abnormal MRI examination. Sixty-two percent had high signals (prolonged T2) on T2-weighted images. Abnormal signals were located primarily in the basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum. Twenty-five percent of patients had abnormal EEGs, 28% had abnormal CTs, and 27% had abnormal BAER examinations. The abnormal signals on MRI did not consistently relate to findings on CT, BAER, EEG, school placement, or clinical examination. The abnormal signals presumably reflect areas of abnormal brain parenchyma, either hamartomas, heterotopias, or local areas of brain dysplasia.\r"

This therapeutic effect continued for 2 years. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed acceleration of the postexercise recovery of the ratio of phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate in muscle during CoQ treatment. These observations support the beneficial effect of CoQ on the impaired mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in muscle. Also, impaired central and peripheral nerve conductivities consistently improved during CoQ treatment. These results indicate that CoQ has clinical value in the long-term management of patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, even though there are clinical limitations to the effects of this therapy.\r"

We collected information on neurofibromatosis and congenital anomalies in study subjects, their siblings and parents by telephone interview with the mother of each case and control. We obtained supplemental information on neurofibromatosis in the patients and their families from hospital medical records. This study confirmed the strong association of neurofibromatosis with risk of CNS tumors. Thirteen cases and no controls had neurofibromatosis. Two fathers and 3 mothers of cases had neurofibromatosis. Five cases had siblings with neurofibromatosis. None of the first-degree relatives of controls had neurofibromatosis. We observed a relative risk of 4.49 for history of seizures. Seizures are often among the presenting symptoms for CNS tumors. We observed no difference between cases and controls in the occurrence of congenital anomalies. There was a nonsignificant excess of congenital anomalies among siblings of cases compared with controls. This decreased to 1.13 when adjusted for number of siblings.\r"

Three of the seven women with antiphospholipid antibodies suffered the following complications during the peripartum period: 1) cerebral infarction and episodes of transient monocular blindness; 2) pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and an autoimmune flare in the postpartum period; and 3) transient monocular blindness and amnesia after delivery. Our experience suggests that antiphospholipid antibodies are found in a substantial proportion of cases of early-onset severe preeclampsia and have important clinical implications. We suggest that patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia be screened for antiphospholipid antibodies; if antibodies are detected, these women should be considered for prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.\r"

In order to assess these recommendations, we collected demographic and historic data on 6214 pregnant women representing a population of universally screened individuals. Of 125 cases of gestational diabetes diagnosed (ACOG criteria), 70 patients (56%) were under the age of 30. In addition, 44% of gestational diabetics had no risk factors.

All women had failed to conceive with clomiphene citrate, and had normal luteal phase PRL levels during unstimulated cycles. Daily serum total estrogens were determined during hMG administration. Serum progesterone and PRL were determined in the mid-luteal phase (7 days post-hCG administration). In 7.5% of the cycles, luteal phase PRL elevations were greater than 25 ng/mL. Only 2.5% of cycles had levels of PRL greater than 35 ng/mL. Hyperprolactinemia infrequently recurred in different cycles of the same patient (two of 16 patients, 12.5%). Cycles with hyperprolactinemia were found to have significantly higher preovulatory estrogen levels. Serum progesterone levels were not significantly decreased in cycles with elevated PRL. Pregnancy rates in cycles with and without hyperprolactinemia were similar (7.7 versus 11.1%, respectively; P greater than .05). We conclude that the development of luteal phase hyperprolactinemia during ovulation induction with hMG/hCG is an isolated event. High preovulatory estrogen levels may predispose to its development. Because hyperprolactinemia is uncommon and is usually mild, other factors must be responsible for the difference between ovulation and pregnancy rates using hMG/hCG.\r"

  ".U": "89183322\r", 
  ".W": "Partial seizures are not uncommon in children. They are classified into two types: simple partial, without impairment of consciousness, and complex partial, with impaired consciousness. For both types, the hallmark is onset of the seizure from a portion of one cerebral hemisphere, as indicated by focal spikes or sharp waves on EEG. The symptoms of simple partial seizures may include focal motor or somatosensory phenomena, special sensory phenomena, autonomic symptoms, or psychic symptoms, and these symptoms may occur alone or they may progress into a complex partial seizure with alteration of consciousness. The complex partial phase may include simply an arrest of ongoing activity with altered awareness and a blank empty stare, or there may also be automatisms, including movements which are gestural, alimentary, mimicking, verbal, or ambulatory. Automatisms are predominantly seen in complex partial seizures arising from temporal areas, but they also may be seen in seizures with extratemporal onset. If the epileptic discharge spreads throughout both cerebral hemispheres, the child will have a secondarily generalized tonic-clonic convulsion. EEG should be performed in any child who is suspected of having partial seizures. If there are focal spikes or sharp waves, then there is strong supportive evidence for a diagnosis of partial seizures in the proper clinical setting. It should be remembered, however, that a normal routine EEG cannot be used to \"rule out\" a diagnosis of epilepsy in patients who have episodes that sound like simple or complex partial seizures. An underlying etiology may be found in a significant percentage of children with partial seizures. Most of these etiologies are static, and the seizures are the result of a previous cerebral insult, but some patients may have slow-growing gliomas or other mass lesions. MRI or CT is indicated in essentially any child with partial seizures. Medical treatment is based on the idea of using single drugs to maximally tolerated doses, if needed, before beginning with two-drug regimens. If the child continues to have seizures despite aggressive trials of medication, then it is important to consider epilepsy surgery, either temporal lobectomy or other cortical resection. When children are identified as candidates for epilepsy surgery, they should be referred to specialized centers for further testing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The measurements were taken while patients remained on the ventilator and during brief discontinuance of mechanical ventilation. The purposes of the study were to determine whether BV status could affect PAP and to quantify the effect of temporary discontinuance of ventilation on ABG. No differences were seen in PAP, mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, oxygen delivery, oxygen extraction, or oxygen consumption regardless of ventilator or BV status. Arterial oxygen tension dropped significantly, p less than .001, in less than 1 minute off ventilation and the decrease persisted for 1 hour after mechanical ventilation was resumed. These results suggest that recording PAP off the ventilator should be abandoned, as this technique contributes little to increased validity of PAP and may result in persistent hypoxemia.\r"

Clinical presentation of B catarrhalis infection varies from a mild, self-limiting disease to severe pneumonia, but most cases are mild to moderate in severity. Infection occurs sporadically, and endogenous spread from the oropharynx is the likely mechanism. The keys to diagnosis are a high index of clinical suspicion, correct interpretation of Gram's stain of sputum, and subsequent confirmation on culture. Because most strains of B catarrhalis produce beta lactamase, antibiotics that resist beta-lactamase production, eg, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Augmentin), erythromycin, ciprofloxacin (Cipro), are recommended. Mild infections can be self-limiting and may not require antibiotic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A structural model of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein alpha subunits (G alpha subunits) is proposed based on the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of the human HRAS protein (p21ras). Because of low overall sequence similarity, structural and functional constraints were used to align the G alpha consensus sequence with that of p21ras. The resulting G alpha model specifies the spatial relationship among the guanine nucleotide-binding site, the binding site of the beta gamma subunit complex, likely regions of effector and receptor interaction, and sites of cholera and pertussis toxin modification. The locations in the model of the experimentally determined sites of proteolytic digestion, point mutation, monoclonal antibody binding, and toxin modification are consistent with and help explain the observed biological activity. Two important findings from our model are (i) the orientation of the G alpha model with respect to the membrane and (ii) the identification of the spatial proximity of the N- and C-terminal regions. Furthermore, by analogy to p21ras, the model assigns specific residues in G alpha required for binding the guanosine (G-box) and phosphates (PO4-box) and identifies residues potentially involved in the conformational switch mechanism (S-box). Specification of these critical regions in the G alpha model suggests guidelines for construction of mutants and chimeric proteins to experimentally test structural and functional hypotheses.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) results in the differentiation of these cells into a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype. Although the initial intracellular signals elicited by NGF remain unknown, some of the cellular effects of NGF are similar to those of other growth factors, such as insulin. We have investigated the involvement of a newly identified inositol-containing glycolipid in signal transduction for the actions of NGF. NGF stimulates the rapid generation of a species of diacylglycerol that is labeled with [3H]myristate but not with [3H]arachidonate. NGF stimulates [3H]myristate- or [32P]phosphate-labeled phosphatidic acid production over the same time course. Although NGF alone has no effect on the turnover of inositol phospholipids, it does stimulate the hydrolysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol. The NGF-dependent cleavage of this lipid is accompanied by an increase in the accumulation of its polar head group, an inositol phosphate glycan, which is generated within 30-60 sec of NGF treatment. In an unresponsive PC-12 mutant cell line, neither the diacylglycerol nor inositol phosphate glycan response is detected. A possible role for the NGF-stimulated diacylglycerol is suggested by the inhibition of NGF-dependent c-fos induction by staurosporin, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C. These results suggest that, like insulin, some of the cellular effects of NGF may be mediated by the phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol.\r"

The subcellular compartmentalization of distinct Gi alpha-2-immunoreactive polypeptides coupled to thrombin and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors was examined in Triton X-100 platelet lysates prepared by highspeed centrifugation. This treatment permitted separation of the Triton-insoluble membrane skeleton from Triton-soluble cell components. In cells treated with either alpha-thrombin or epinephrine, we observed that a greater proportion of Gi alpha-2 was localized in the Triton-soluble fraction than in the Triton-insoluble fraction. Pertussis toxin was found to catalyze ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha-2 in whole platelets. In thrombin-stimulated cells, this activity was confined to the Triton-soluble fraction and was markedly lower than that of unstimulated cells. Epinephrine, on the other hand, promoted translocation of a portion of the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi alpha-2 from the Triton-soluble fraction to the Triton-insoluble fraction. In addition, epinephrine stimulated translocation of a phosphorylated protein of approximately 38 kDa that was not ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin. This protein expressed immunoreactivity with the general Gi alpha antiserum AS/7 but not with the Gi alpha-2 antiserum LE/3. These findings suggest a role for specific localization of Gi alpha proteins in epinephrine-induced platelet responses.\r"

Albumin Oriximina I has the same exchange as albumin Maku (541 Lys----Glu). Some of these findings can be explained only by the occurrence of independent mutations at the same site in the albumin gene. They also point to a third cluster of mutations in that gene, indicating hypermutability in some of its segments.\r"

  ".W": "Highly purified endosomal membranes from rat liver, enriched in receptors for a number of macromolecules taken up into hepatocytes via the coated pit/endosome/lysosome pathway [including the receptor for low density lipoproteins (LDL)], were used to characterize binding sites for lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein E. In endosomal membranes from livers of estradiol-treated rats, in which LDL receptors are induced manyfold, two high-affinity binding sites were found for two apolipoprotein E-rich lipoproteins: very low density beta-lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) from cholesterol-fed rabbits and rat chylomicron remnants. One of these sites, binding to which is inhibited by 30 mM EDTA, appears identical to the LDL receptor by ligand and immunoblotting and other characteristics. The other site, highly resistant to EDTA, does not bind LDL. Binding to the EDTA-resistant site, however, is readily inhibited by heparin (as is the LDL receptor) and also by antisera prepared against rat or bovine LDL receptor. The distribution of the EDTA-resistant site among early endosomes, late endosomes, and endosome-derived receptor-recycling membranes is similar to that of the LDL receptor and other recycling receptors. The LDL receptor was present in endosomal membranes from livers of untreated rats at about 10% of the level found in membranes from estradiol-treated rats, but the EDTA-resistant site was barely detectable. No saturable binding of beta-VLDL that could not be inhibited by antisera to the LDL receptor could be detected in endosomal membranes from livers of either untreated or estradiol-treated rats. The EDTA-resistant site may be a modified form of the LDL receptor that recognizes apolipoprotein E but not the B apolipoprotein of LDL. Alternatively, it may be a distinct receptor sharing immunological determinants with the LDL receptor, specialized for the endocytosis of certain lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein E, including chylomicron remnants.\r"

  ".U": "89184539\r", 
  ".W": "Two classes of early genes in Dictyostelium are differentially regulated by extracellular pulses of cAMP interacting with its cell-surface receptor, conditions that also regulate chemotaxis and aggregation. The pulse-repressed genes, such as K5, are induced shortly after the onset of starvation and are repressed a few hr later during aggregation by cAMP pulses. The pulse-induced genes (including D2, M3, and those encoding contact sites A, the G alpha protein subunit G alpha 2, and the cell-surface cAMP receptor) are maximally induced just prior to aggregation by pulses of cAMP and are subsequently repressed by sustained moderate levels of cAMP--conditions that exist sequentially in development. In this manuscript, we further analyze the requirement for cAMP pulses and characterize a requirement for protein synthesis for the expression of these two classes of genes. Our results indicate that the control of expression of both the pulse-induced and pulse-repressed genes requires other developmentally regulated factors in addition to starvation and cAMP pulses. We also identified another early gene, F9, whose expression is stimulated upon starvation, is not responsive to cAMP, and is hyperstimulated by cycloheximide, in a manner similar to the cycloheximide stimulation of c-fos and other serum-induced genes in mammalian cells. Examination of the kinetics of expression of the pulse-induced genes in a mutant blocked in the cAMP relay pathway indicates that their expression is controlled by a two-phase process. The first phase requires starvation and CMF, an extracellular conditioned medium factor, and results in a low level of expression. The second phase requires establishment of the cAMP signal-relay system and induces the genes to a high level. Both phases require prior and concomitant protein synthesis. Some of the members of the pulse-induced class encode elements of the cAMP signal-relay system that controls aggregation, indicating a feedback autoregulation. The two-phase process might allow the \"finetuning\" of the level of expression of genes involved in aggregation.\r"

We have developed an application of the polymerase chain reaction that is useful for the isolation of partial cDNA or genomic clones of conserved genes. We used this technique to clone the gene encoding the iron protein subunit (27 kDa) of succinate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.5.1) from several species, including human, rat, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mixed oligonucleotide primers corresponding to two conserved regions of the protein were used in conjunction with genomic and cDNA templates in the reaction. The primers contained all possible nucleotide combinations that could encode the corresponding peptide sequences. These oligonucleotide mixtures contained 262,144 (2(18] and 8192 (2(13] unique sequences, respectively. Use of the polymerase chain reaction for homology probing allows one to utilize more complex mixtures of oligonucleotides as probes than is possible with filter hybridization screening techniques. In addition, the polymerase chain reaction offers the advantage of synthesizing the DNA product directly, in some cases obviating the need to construct cDNA or genomic libraries. This application of the polymerase chain reaction should be useful not only for the identification of conserved genes in a variety of species but also for the isolation of previously unknown members of gene families.\r"

Both ribosomal DNA and Stellate, the two families examined here, have multiple copies of similar sequences on the X and Y chromosomes. Although the rate of sequence divergence on the Y chromosome depends on rates of mutation, gene conversion and exchange with the X chromosome, as well as purifying selection, the regulation of gene copy number may also depend on other pleiotropic functions, such as maintenance of chromosome pairing. Gene copy numbers were estimated for a series of 34 Y chromosome replacement lines using densitometric measurements of slot blots of genomic DNA from adult Drosophila melanogaster. Scans of autoradiographs of the same blots probed with the cloned alcohol dehydrogenase gene, a single copy gene, served as internal standards. Copy numbers span a 6-fold range for ribosomal DNA and a 3-fold range for Stellate DNA. Despite this magnitude of variation, there was no association between copy number and segregation variation of the sex chromosomes.\r"

Overproduction of the BCL-2 protein conferred a selective growth advantage to the EBV-infected B cells as selective growth advantage to the EBV-infected B cells as compared with control transfectants in low-serum medium and also after seeding at limiting dilution but did not render the cells tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. This growth enhancement was also seen in cells transfected with the BCL-2 gene with its own promoter juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer, which represents the translocated form of the BCL-2 gene observed in follicular lymphomas with the t(14;18) translocation. The growth advantage of EBV-infected B cells overproducing the BCL-2 protein is neither due to the enhanced growth factor production nor due to an enhanced sensitivity of the BCL-2 transfectants to interleukins 1 or 6, although both lymphokines are known to stimulate proliferation of EBV-infected B-cell lines. The growth advantage of EBV-infected B cells by overproduction of the BCL-2 protein suggests the direct involvement of the BCL-2 gene product in the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma.\r"

Addition of IFN-alpha to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate-pretreated MOLT-4 cells causes a greater than 20-fold increase in the expression of class I HLA, as compared to a 4- to 7-fold IFN-alpha-induced increase in control cells. Pretreatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate does not alter the class I HLA response to IFN-gamma or the responses of other IFN-induced genes. This effect of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate reproduces in MOLT-4 cells the phenotype of the mutant YHHH, which also displays a selective enhanced class I HLA response to IFN-alpha. Pretreatment of YHHH with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate does not affect any of the responses induced by IFN. These findings suggest the existence of a phorbol ester-sensitive factor, inducible in MOLT-4 and constitutively expressed or modified in YHHH, which operates in the pathway of induction of class I HLA by IFN-alpha but not in the pathway used by IFN-gamma.\r"

Growth inhibition of the transfected lymphoma cells in response to anti-idiotype antibodies was used to measure signaling. Hybrid IgM molecules were constructed so that the membrane-spanning region of the mu heavy chain was replaced by that of delta, gamma 2b, or alpha heavy chains or that of the I-Ab class II (Ia) alpha chain. All transfectants that expressed IgM or hybrid IgM molecules with membrane-spanning regions from another Ig isotype underwent signaling in response to anti-idiotype antibodies, whereas the IgM-Ia hybrid transfectants did not. Transfectants that expressed wild-type IgD molecules also underwent signaling, although this response was particularly sensitive to serum concentrations. These results imply that signaling occurs in a similar manner through heavy-chain receptors of any isotype and suggest that conserved amino acid sequences in the transmembrane regions are important in this process.\r"

The inhibition of growth of the Mia PaCa-2 cells in culture was also evaluated to determine the mechanism of action of somatostatin analogues and their relative effectiveness in inhibiting cancer growth. Of the analogues tested D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Trp-NH2 (RC-160) caused the greatest stimulation of tyrosine phosphatase activity. Analogue D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Thr-NH2 (RC-121) had less effect but was more potent than somatostatin-14. Analogue D-Phe-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr(ol) (SMS 201-995) produced no significant dephosphorylation. The analogues displayed the same order of activity in assays on growth inhibition of Mia PaCa-2 cells in cultures. Analogue (SMS-201-995) caused virtually no tyrosine phosphatase stimulation or growth inhibition in this cancer cell line, although it possesses a much higher antisecretory activity than somatostatin-14 in normal tissues. These observations indicate that somatostatin and some of its analogues can act as growth inhibitors in cancer cells through the activation of tyrosine phosphatase. These data reinforce the view that somatostatin analogue RC-160 and related compounds could be used for treatment of pancreatic cancer.\r"

Nonetheless, PC4 appears devoid of antiviral activity. PC4 is expressed in proliferating and differentiating tissues, such as amnion, placenta, and brain at embryonic day 13.5.

Haldane pointed out [Haldane, J.B.S. (1932) The Causes of Evolution (Harper & Row, New York)] that selection which favors individuals in the upper tail of a composite distribution curve tends to favor members of the more variable of two populations, rather than members of a less variable one, even though the latter may possess the higher mean. In addition to reviewing earlier observations bearing on Haldane's argument, the present report describes an analysis of the comparative egg-to-adult viabilities of flies (Drosophila melanogaster) carrying combinations of second chromosomes obtained from one or another of eight experimental populations. Overall, the viabilities of flies carrying combinations of chromosomes one of which is shared (i/j vs. j/k) are as different as those of flies carrying combinations of independently sampled chromosomes (i/j vs. k/l). Episodes seemingly occurred within the populations during which flies carrying combinations that shared a chromosome differed more in their viabilities than flies carrying unrelated combinations. Such episodes could reflect the occurrence of selection of the sort described by Haldane.\r"

Using electrophoretic techniques, we show that these factors induce a stable bend in the DNA upon binding, and the bend center is shown to coincide with the CC(A + T-rich)6GG element. In addition, the ability to bend DNA is retained by a small proteolytic fragment of the protein, suggesting that the DNA-binding domain of the protein is resistant to proteases and is sufficient to bend DNA.\r"

PA is believed to interact with a membrane receptor, and after proteolytic processing, to mediate endocytosis and subsequent translocation of EF or LF into the cytosol. PA can be separated, after mild trypsinolysis, into two fragments, PA65 (65 kDa) and PA20 (20 kDa). We demonstrate that trypsin-cleaved PA is capable of forming cation-selective channels in planar phospholipid bilayer membranes and that this activity is confined to the PA65 fragment; PA20, LF, and EF are devoid of channel-forming activity. These PA65 channels exhibit pH-dependent and voltage-dependent activity--a property reminiscent of the channels formed by the two-chain proteins diphtheria, tetanus, and botulinum toxins.\r"

Extensive molecular heterogeneity was seen at the gamma-chain level and, to a lesser extent, at the delta-chain level. Both disulfide and non-disulfide gamma delta TCR were found and use different gamma chains with similar molecular masses (range, 41-43 kDa). In contrast, gamma chains of 55-60 kDa, which are expressed on T-cell lines derived from the peripheral blood of patients with immunodeficiency disorders, were not found on T-cell clones derived from the peripheral blood of normal donors. delta chains expressed on these T-cell clones had a molecular mass of 37 kDa and were either disulfide or nondisulfide linked. Significant delta-chain heterogeneity was identified in these clones using the anti-delta TCS1 and the anti-TCR delta 1 monoclonal antibodies. All clones tested were TCR delta 1+, whereas only 25% of the clones were delta TCS1+. The anti-delta TCS1 monoclonal antibody stained and immunoprecipitated both disulfide- and non-disulfide-linked gamma delta TCRs from different T-cell clones from normal donors.\r"

Using in vivo transfection techniques specificially designed for these primary T cells in conjunction with in vitro gel retardation and DNA footprinting assays, we found that activation of the IL-2R alpha promoter by each of these agents involves the induction of nuclear proteins that specifically interact with a kappa B-like enhancer element (i.e., an element resembling the immunoglobulin kappa-chain enhancer sequence recognized by transcription factor NF-kappa B). DNA-protein crosslinking studies revealed that primary T cells express at least three different inducible DNA-binding proteins (50-55, 70-75, and 80-90 kDa) that specifically interact with this IL-2R alpha kappa B element.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of peptide hormones to surface membrane receptors leads to the transcription of specific genes within relevant target cells. How these signals are transduced to alter gene expression is largely unknown, but this mechanism probably involves a sequence of enzymatic steps that activate factors in the nucleus that modulate transcription. We now demonstrate that two different peptide hormones, or cytokines, stimulate the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer, and this effect is mediated by nuclear factor (NF) kappa B (nuclear factor that binds the kappa immunoglobulin light chain gene enhancer). These cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1, act on multiple cell types and represent the only naturally occurring activators of this transcription factor among eight cytokines examined. Although NF-kappa B binding can be stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, tumor necrosis factor alpha acts through an independent mechanism, inducing NF-kappa B binding in HT-2 cells, which did not show increased binding in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and causing superinduction in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells. Tumor necrosis factor alpha is also a more selective activator of T cells than phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, having no effect on lymphokine production in EL-4 cells at the same time it induces NF-kappa B. These findings suggest that human immunodeficiency virus gene expression can be induced in T cells without activating lymphokine secretion and that the role of these cytokines in the activation of latent human immunodeficiency virus infection deserves further clinical evaluation. Finally, this link between binding at the surface membrane and stimulation of a specific transcription factor should help define intermediates for these cytokine activation pathways.\r"

This demonstrates that the transgene can undergo an isotype switch. Four transgenic founder lines all exhibited transgene isotype switching despite the likelihood of random chromosomal integration of the transgene. In addition one of the lines was analyzed by breeding studies and the transgene was found to be genetically unlinked to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus. These results indicate that a precise chromosomal location is not required for isotype switching and suggest the possibility that the isotype switching process can occur interchromosomally.\r"

All four clones had kappa-chain gene rearrangements at either one or both alleles, but the heavy-chain gene loci in these clones either were in germ-line context or had undergone only D-JH rearrangements (D and JH represent diversity and joining gene segments). All clones contained kappa mRNA of normal size at levels consistent with the protein level, except for one clone that no longer produced kappa protein. No mu mRNA or immunoglobulin heavy-chain molecules were detected in any of the kappa+ clones. The results suggest that the mu heavy-chain protein is not an obligatory prerequisite for light-chain gene rearrangements.\r"

Earlier biosynthetic studies had identified a defective alpha-subunit that failed to associate with the beta-subunit. We have now found a guanosine to adenosine transition at the 3' end of exon 7, which causes substitution of serine for glycine at position 269 of the alpha-subunit [designated 269 (Gly----Ser) substitution]. An RNase protection assay was used to localize the mutation to a segment of mRNA from fibroblasts of a patient with the adult-onset disorder. That segment of mRNA (after reverse transcription) and a corresponding segment of genomic DNA were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced by the dideoxy method. The sequence analysis, together with an assay based on the loss of a ScrFI restriction site, showed that the patient was a compound heterozygote who had inherited the 269 (Gly----Ser) mutation from his father and an allelic null mutation from his mother. The 269 (Gly----Ser) mutation, in compound heterozygosity with a presumed null allele, was also found in fetal fibroblasts with an association-defective phenotype and in cells from five patients with chronic GM2 gangliosidosis. It was not found in beta-hexosaminidase A-deficient cells obtained from patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease nor in cells from individuals who do not have beta-hexosaminidase A deficiency. However, there must be additional mutations with similar consequences, since the 269 (Gly----Ser) substitution was not present in fibroblasts from two patients with juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis even though these had an association-defective alpha-subunit.\r"

This protein had an apparent molecular weight of 24,000 and an isoelectric point of 7.0. The NH2-amino acid sequence for the first 40 residues agreed completely with that predicted from the known TSST-1 genome. Ouchterlony immunodiffusion with monospecific rabbit antisera demonstrated a single line of identity with reference TSST-1 as well as with three preparations obtained from other investigators. When the purity of the different TSST-1 preparations was examined by Coomassie blue or silver staining after SDS-PAGE, only the major band at molecular weight 24,000 was apparent. However, multiple additional bands were seen in all preparations when visualized either by double staining with Coomassie blue stain followed by silver stain or by immunoblot using pooled human serum. Further purification of our preparation by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography eliminated some, but not all, extraneous antigens. A final purification step by preparative SDS-PAGE resulted in an eluted protein that yielded only the 24-kDa TSST-1 band and a 48-kDa dimer by immunoblot. This material was endotoxin free (sensitivity limit, 10 pg/mL) and retained biologic activity for induction of cachectin and production of interleukin 1 by human monocytes. These data emphasize the need for stringent methods of assessment of purity in TSST-1 preparations.\r"

The results showed differences between PHA and TSST-1 in the appearance of the tested T cell subset markers and of interleukin 2 receptors. In general, the stimulation of mononuclear cells by TSST-1 was slower than that by phytohemagglutinin. TSST-1 induced the production of interferon in cultures of murine spleen cells. By means of inhibition studies with specific antibodies to interferon, the interferon produced was characterized as the gamma type. Human mononuclear cells exposed to the toxin also produced gamma interferon, with levels similar to those induced by staphylococcal enterotoxin A, a known potent interferon inducer. The induction of gamma interferon by TSST-1 may play a role in the immunosuppression caused by TSST-1.\r"

Levels of toxin in culture supernatants were measured by a quantitative immunodiffusion assay. Most vaginal TSS isolates produced TSST-1, either alone or with EntC1. However, strains that produced EntB or EntC1 but did not express TSST-1 were commonly isolated from patients with nonmenstrual TSS; EntB was usually produced alone or--rarely--with EntC1. These results were confirmed by probing DNA from representative isolates with an internal probe of the EntC1 gene (entC1). Extensive sequence homology between entC1 and entB enabled detection of both genes under conditions of high stringency. The genomic location of entC1 in strains producing both EntC1 and TSST-1 varied little but was dependent on the mammalian host. In contrast, the genomic location of entC1 or entB in strains producing EntC1 or EntB alone was variable. These results suggest that these genes are contained on mobile elements.\r"

The many (from 1 to more than 20) ubiquitin moieties attached to a molecule of beta gal occur as an ordered chain of branched ubiquitin-ubiquitin conjugates in which the carboxyl-terminal Gly76 of one ubiquitin is jointed to the internal Lys48 of an adjacent ubiquitin. This multiubiquitin chain is linked to one of two specific Lys residues in beta gal. These same Lys residues have been identified by molecular genetic analysis as components of the aminoterminal degradation signal in beta gal. The experiments with ubiquitin mutated at its Lys48 residue indicate that the multiubiquitin chain in a targeted protein is essential for the degradation of the protein.\r"

The DNA sequences to which C/EBP binds in vitro have been implicated in the control of messenger RNA synthesis. It has therefore been predicted that C/EBP will play a role in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells. The region of the C/EBP polypeptide required for direct interaction with DNA has been identified and shown to bear amino acid sequence relatedness with the product of the myc, fos, and jun proto-oncogenes. The arrangement of these related amino acid sequences led to the prediction of a new structural motif, termed the \"leucine zipper,\" that plays a role in facilitating sequence-specific interaction between protein and DNA. Experimental tests now provide support for the leucine zipper hypothesis.\r"

Homodimeric cJun protein synthesized in vitro is capable of binding selectively to AP-1 recognition sites, whereas the cFos polypeptide is not. When cotranslated, the cFos and cJun proteins can form a stable, heterodimeric complex with the DNA binding properties of AP-1/cJun. The related proteins Jun B and vJun are also able to form DNA binding complexes with cFos. Directed mutagenesis of the cFos protein reveals that a leucine repeat structure is required for binding to cJun, in a manner consistent with the proposed function of the \"leucine zipper.\" A novel domain adjacent to, but distinct from, the leucine repeat of cFos is required for DNA binding by cFos-cJun heterodimers. Thus experimental evidence is presented that leucine repeats can mediate complex formation between heterologous proteins and that promotes further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of two proto-oncogene products.\r"

Moreover, whereas IEL from normal mice are 30 to 50 percent Thy-1+, IEL from germ-free did not express Thy-1. Acclimation of germ-free mice to nonsterile conditions resulted in the generation of Thy-1+ IEL and induction of lytic activity. Thus CD8+ TCR-gamma delta IEL were regulated by externally derived stimuli via a specific functional interaction between IEL and gut-associated antigens.\r"

Fifty percent inhibitory dose (ID50) values of 18 isolates from untreated individuals ranged between 0.01 microM and 0.05 microM. In contrast, most isolates from patients who had received zidovudine for 6 months or more exhibited decreased sensitivity characterized by changes in ID50 or ID95 values (or both), with isolates from several patients (5/15) showing 100-fold increases in ID50. The latter isolates were also insensitive to 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine; however, the isolates were still sensitive to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine, or phosphonoformate. It cannot be determined from this small sample of patients whether development of a less sensitive virus phenotype results in clinical resistance. Appearance of such variants was not associated with a consistent increase in viral p24 concentrations in patient plasma and did not herald any sudden deterioration in clinical status. More extensive studies are required to determine the clinical significance. Thus, it would be premature to alter any treatment protocols for HIV-infected individuals at present.\r"

Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of calorie substrate used. Glucose and twice weekly lipid infusion (glucose based) were used in 60 per cent; 27 per cent required daily lipid infusion (lipid based), and 13 per cent received no lipid because of pre-existing hyperlipemia or thrombocytopenia (no lipid). Nutritional indices (albumin, transferrin and total lymphocyte count) were initially abnormal in more than 80 per cent of patients, and 50 per cent had three or more of Ranson's criteria. After TPN, 81 per cent had improved nutritional indices, and none had hypertriglyceridemia or aggravation of pancreatitis develop. Patients who received lipid based or no lipid had higher insulin requirements (p less than 0.01) than those receiving mainly glucose. Mortality was increased tenfold (2.5 versus 21.4 per cent, p less than 0.01) in patients who did not achieve positive nitrogen balance. We conclude that TPN, either lipid or glucose based, is a safe and effective therapy to reverse the malnutrition of acute pancreatitis and that failure to achieve positive nitrogen balance is associated with increased mortality.\r"

In 12 patients undergoing liver transplantation continuous recording of whole body energy production was made on the basis of gas exchange measurements during the surgical procedure. Oxygen consumption decreased rapidly by 25% when the blood supply to the native liver was interrupted. After the anhepatic period, there was a sharp increase of oxygen consumption with successful reperfusion of the allograft. Carbon dioxide production fell by 14% and returned to preanhepatic values after successful declamping. In two cases with suboptimal reperfusion the return of gas exchange values was slow and incomplete. Results from the studies of whole body energy production were compared with biochemical measurements. No significant accumulation of amino acids occurred during the anhepatic period, but in the two patients with incomplete revascularization, clearance of amino acids, after the anhepatic phase, was impaired and plasma amino acids accumulated. The same pattern was found for plasma lactate levels. By the techniques described in this article, rapid and reliable assessment of initial and early graft function in hepatic transplantation is possible. This is of great value for the intraoperative and early postoperative assessment and planning of surgical and anesthesiologic strategies.\r"

No relationship was seen between atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations and mean pulmonary artery or right atrial pressure, or calculated pulmonary or systemic vascular resistance. Patients with the most severe hypoxaemia tended to have higher plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations; three patients with no past history of oedema had concentrations more than twice the upper limit of normal. Treatment with supplementary oxygen for 30 minutes reduced pulmonary vascular resistance in all patients but had no significant effect on plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration. These findings suggest that atrial natriuretic peptide may be a factor in the control of sodium and water balance in hypoxic cor pulmonale, where the determinants of individual susceptibility to peripheral oedema are not well understood.\r"

Six cats with peripheral chemodenervation (bilateral carotid sinus nerve and vagal neurotomy) were studied while anaesthetised with chloralose urethane and breathing spontaneously at a regulated, constant, and somewhat raised end tidal PCO2. Variables were measured during steady state normoxaemia and 10 and 30 minutes after administration of 17 mg/kg aminophylline (mean (SD) blood concentration of theophylline 14.2 (1.5) mg/l). Aminophylline resulted in a significant and considerable increase in minute ventilation to 155% and 167% above baseline at 10 and 30 minutes. Mean (SD) values for arterial PCO2 were 5.6 (0.6), 5.6 (0.6), and 5.4 (0.6) kPa at 0, 10, and 30 minutes. Values for the ventral medullary extracellular fluid PCO2 were 7.6 (1.1), 7.5 (1.0), and 7.4 (1.0) kPa and for H+ concentration 62.7 (9.3), 62.6 (9.3), and 63.5 (8.0) nmol/l at 0, 10, and 30 minutes. After aminophylline infusion the PCO2 and H+ concentration of the extracellular fluid did not differ significantly from baseline values. It is concluded that in spontaneously breathing, peripherally chemodenervated cats the considerable increase in ventilation that follows an infusion of aminophylline is not mediated by change in the ventral medullary extracellular fluid PCO2 or hydrogen ion concentration.\r"

Blood flow was computed from the concentration history of xenon-133 in the volume of interest measured with an ultrapure germanium detector array. End-tidal PaCO2 ranged from 35.4 to 42.6 mm Hg.

We performed detailed hemostatic investigations at follow-up in 38 (90%) of the remaining 42 patients in whom the cause of the stroke was unknown or uncertain; results of the basic hemostatic screening tests (including that for fibrinogen) were uniformly normal. All 38 patients demonstrated a normal fibrinolytic response as measured by tissue plasminogen activator release to a standard venous occlusion stress test; concentration of the inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator was not increased. No abnormalities in the concentrations of the inhibitory proteins C or S or antithrombin III were identified, and none of the 38 patients had evidence of a lupus anticoagulant.

Many potential free radical-generating systems exist. The primary products of these reactions, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, may combine to produce hydroxyl radicals. Of the many potential sources of free radical generation, the enzyme xanthine oxidase has been shown to be important in ischemia in noncerebral tissue. We investigated the effect of the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea and the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol on infarct volume in a model of continuous partial ischemia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with dimethylthiourea or allopurinol before middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct volume was measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining of brains removed 3 or 24 hours after occlusion. Stroke volume was reduced by 30% after dimethylthiourea treatment and by 32-35% after allopurinol treatment. At 24 hours after stroke, cortical tissue was more effectively protected than caudate tissue with both agents. Pretreatment with dimethylthiourea and allopurinol also significantly reduced cerebral edema formation and improved blood-brain barrier function as measured by fluorescein uptake. Our results imply that hydroxyl radicals are important in tissue injury secondary to partial cerebral ischemia and that xanthine oxidase may be the primary source of these radicals.\r"

Ten patients (group 1), seven of whom had no symptoms during PTCA, maintained a normal mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of less than or equal to 13 mm Hg during PTCA, whereas five patients (group 2), all of whom had symptoms and signs of ischemia during PTCA, had an increased PCWP of greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg. ANP levels did not differ significantly between the two groups before PTCA, but ANP-PA (p less than 0.02) and ANP-V (p less than 0.01) during PTCA were higher in group 2 than in group 1. ANP-V at rest and during exercise was measured in 11 patients with and 14 patients without anginal symptoms and ischemic ST changes on the ECG during exercise. The values did not change significantly in either group, and there were no difference between the groups. Thus myocardial ischemia during PTCA may lead to left ventricular dysfunction serious enough to increase PCWP and subsequently plasma ANP levels in some patients. Myocardial ischemia induced by dynamic exercise seems to be unrelated to significant changes in the plasma ANP level.\r"

In an attempt to elucidate the nature of the dysautonomia in patients with Chagas' disease, we measured plasma norepinephrine levels, blood pressure, and heart rate, both supine and standing in 26 patients, and compared these values of patients classified according to three clinical subsets of cardiovascular manifestations with the values of nine normal volunteers and 16 patients with nonchagasic heart failure. Results suggested (1) progressive blockade of the alpha receptor in patients with Chagas' disease who have minimal clinical symptoms (group I) and in those who have ECG alterations without congestive symptoms (group II), as reflected by normal or raised plasma norepinephrine levels without change of diastolic blood pressure during standing, which indicates absent postural reflexes; and (2) blockade associated with partial denervation in patients with Chagas' disease who have class III or IV heart failure (group III), as suggested by a lower supine plasma norepinephrine level and a fall in diastolic blood pressure in the upright position. The findings of reduced plasma norepinephrine levels are in contrast to the elevated plasma norepinephrine levels in patients without Chagas' disease with class III and IV heart failure who have sympathetic hyperactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration was determined and cardiac ultrasound studies were performed in 50 patients with malignant mid-gut carcinoid tumors. The extent of carcinoid-related heart disease varied among the patients. The patients with the most severe right-sided heart disease, who often had signs of right ventricular failure, had significantly (p less than 0.001) higher plasma ANP concentrations than either patients with less or no abnormal ultrasound findings or age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. ANP levels were serially determined for 0.5 to 4 years (median 2.1) in 12 patients. The levels increased above the reference range in patients with clinical findings of right ventricular failure. In patients without cardiac decompensation the levels remained within the reference range. In 3 patients who had successful tricuspid and pulmonary valve replacements, signs and symptoms of right ventricular failure disappeared and plasma ANP levels declined and normalized. Five patients with progressive right ventricular failure and increasing plasma ANP levels during follow-up eventually died from cardiac decompensation. This study demonstrates the predictive value of serial determinations of plasma ANP in carcinoid heart disease. Such measurements can be an additional guide in the clinical management of these patients.\r"

Venous tone was determined by the equilibration technique. Mercury-in-silastic plethysmography was used to measure changes in forearm volume before and after ice application during control conditions, and before and after ice application in the venodilated state (nitroglycerin spray, 0.8 mg). Venous tone and arterial pressure increased significantly after the application of ice to the forehead in both the control and venodilated states, indicating that ice increased sympathetic tone. Nitroglycerin increased venous volume by 0.28 cc/100 cc arm. The venoconstrictive effect of ice after nitroglycerin (a decrease in venous volume of 0.53 cc/100 cc arm) was quantitatively similar to the venoconstrictive effect of ice during control conditions (a decrease in venous volume of 0.54 cc/100 cc arm). These results suggest that sympathetic-induced venoconstriction is not attenuated in the venodilated state.\r"

HPN patients were restudied after 1 mo of nightly intravenous carnitine administration. HPN patients tolerated the short-term fast well, exhibiting neither hypoglycemia nor hypoketonemia. Intravenous carnitine had no effect on rates of fatty acid oxidation, ketone body production, glucose production, or leucine kinetics in either group. Routine addition of carnitine to the HPN regimen does not appear to be necessary. The failure of L-carnitine administration to have discernable effects on intermediary metabolism in normal volunteers casts doubt on its role in the treatment of a variety of medical conditions.\r"

With use of the sex-averaged maps of Dracopoli et al. and Donis-Keller et al. and a strategy of rolling multipoint analyses, support was gained for the exclusion of ADRP from a 224-cM region of the chromosome, including almost the entire short arm. The disease locus was significantly excluded from within at least 50 cM of the rhesus locus and, as a loose linkage between these two genes has been suggested by other studies, this result may support the possibility of genetic heterogeneity within the autosomal dominant subgroup of retinitis pigmentosa.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS AND METHODS: Antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant antibodies to cardiolipin, and a false-positive result on testing for syphilis have been linked to thrombotic vascular occlusions, particularly in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or lupus-like disease, i.e., patients not fulfilling four American Rheumatism Association criteria for the classification of SLE. The clinical and serologic features of 35 patients with cerebrovascular disease (strokes/transient ischemic attacks) who demonstrated antibodies to phospholipids are presented. Complete histories were obtained from all 35 patients, and all underwent routine physical examinations, radiography, electrocardiography, computed tomographic brain scanning, and immunologic studies. Psychometric tests were performed in nine patients. RESULTS: The strokes were often multiple and were followed by multi-infarct dementia in nine patients. Of particular interest were 10 patients in whom the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies was the major and often the sole immunologic disturbance present. Several of these patients were antinuclear antibody-negative, and the antinuclear antibodies, when present, were usually of a low titer (1:40 to 1:160). These patients conform to a group classified as having a primary antiphospholipid syndrome. CONCLUSION: Antiphospholipid antibodies are strongly associated with cerebrovascular occlusions in patients with SLE as well as in those with lupus-like disease and the primary antiphospholipid syndrome. All patients with any of these conditions who present with vascular events should be screened for these antibodies, as their occurrence may have a bearing on future therapy.\r"

Antibody levels were measured before therapy (baseline) and then serially during subsequent stimulation cycles, for a maximum of six cycles. Twenty-eight patients underwent intrauterine insemination; each patient served as her own control. An additional 25 patients were treated with exogenous gonadotropins but did not undergo intrauterine insemination; they served as external controls. Antisperm antibody levels in women who underwent concomitant intrauterine insemination were compared with levels in those who did not. Of the 53 enrolled patients, 18 completed six treatment cycles, and 35 achieved pregnancy before six cycles. Forty-five patients (85%) had less than 10% Immunobead binding, six (11%) had binding between 10% and 25% (mean 16%, range 14% to 20%), and two had binding greater than 25% (28% and 42%, respectively). Mean binding was similar (less than 10%) in the intrauterine insemination and external control groups. Eighteen patients conceived in the intrauterine insemination group and seventeen in the control group. Of patients who conceived, all but one had less than 10% Immunobead binding at the time of conception (mean 1.6 months). In patients who did not conceive, there was no difference in Immunobead binding between control and intrauterine insemination groups after 6 months of therapy. Our data do not support the hypothesis that serum antisperm antibody levels, as detected by Immunobead binding, will increase in menotropin-stimulated women undergoing intrauterine insemination over a prolonged treatment period.\r"

All characteristics are obtainable from combinations of the principal and secondary diagnoses and procedures in the case, and are available from discharge abstracts. The presence of a quality of care problem is confirmed through a review of the medical record by a nurse and two or more physicians. A logistic regression model that controls for various patient and hospital variables is used as a measure of each of the proposed case characteristics. The results indicate that most of the characteristics are associated with higher percentages of quality of care problems than cases chosen at random, and that the methodology has promise as a tool for targeting cases for medical record review.\r"

For 10 of 20 medical DRGs and 13 of 23 surgical DRGs examined, we were able to increase the ability to predict LOS by at least 10 per cent.

Mumps rates declined from 3.85 per 100,000 active duty soldiers per year in 1980 to 1.28 in 1985, but an outbreak during 1986 caused rates to jump to 6.65. Attack rates were found to decline dramatically with increasing age or length of military service, with 74 per cent of cases occurring in soldiers with three years or less of service. Rates for Blacks and Whites were similar, but were higher for other minorities. Complications reported were mild. A cost-benefit analysis, assuming all recruits were to be vaccinated, estimated average annual vaccination program costs of $286,789; this figure exceeds average annual reported hospitalized mumps disease costs of $61,525 by a factor of 4.7. Mumps attack rates would have to reach at least 15.0 per 100,000 per year before savings would equal recruit vaccination costs. Failure to show that a vaccine program would be cost-saving may be due to limitations in identifying cases or to the requirement that all recruits be immunized regardless of prior immune status. It is likely that a program to immunize susceptible individuals alone would show benefit.\r"

Initial changes were synovial hypertrophy, subsynovial edema, and vascular congestion. At concentrations of 100 ppm or greater, focal synovial necrosis, hemorrhage, and gross diffuse synovitis were observed. The degree of synovial inflammation was proportional to the concentration of Cidex. Observation of synovial response versus time demonstrated this reaction to be a chemical synovitis without histologic evidence of a delayed hypersensitivity allergic component. Significant intraoperative levels of Cidex were noted in the rise solutions at several hospitals. When a single rinse is used, the concentration of Cidex present in the rinse basin is 100 to 300 ppm. If the same rinse is used for subsequent cases, the Cidex concentration is on the order of 1,000 ppm by the fifth arthroscopic procedure. If a double rinse is used and the rinse changed with each operative case, the Cidex concentration in the second rinse is less than 10 ppm. After irrigation of the knee joint with 1 liter of saline, the intraarticular concentration of Cidex is less than 10 ppm regardless of the rinse technique.\r"

When supernatants from cultures of stimulated PBMN from normal donors were assayed, only those obtained from cells which had been cultured in presence of PHA displayed chemotactic activity for neutrophils. In contrast, supernatants from cultures of SWAP or SEA stimulated PBMN from patients with intestinal or hepatosplenic schistosomiasis were shown to contain chemotactic activity for neutrophils from normal individuals. PBMN from persons who previously had been infected with Schistosoma mansoni but had received chemotherapy years before presented a pattern of response to SWAP or SEA similar to those from patients with active infections. The response of splenocytes from patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis was considerably different from PBMN from individuals with active or with treated schistosomiasis. Splenocytes from most of those patients with hepatosplenic disease failed to produce chemotactic factors for neutrophils in response to stimulation with at least 1 of the schistosome antigens tested. These results indicate that the lymphocytes from schistosomiasis mansoni patients are able to recognize and are stimulated by adult worm and egg antigens to produce chemotactic substances for neutrophils, and that this ability persists for many years after chemotherapy with schistosomicidal drugs. At the hepatosplenic stage, immunoregulatory mechanisms, which may prevent the production of chemotactic factors by splenocytes and/or their activity upon neutrophils in vitro, seem to occur.\r"

Engorged nymphae of 4 ixodid species, Hyalomma marginatum rufipes, H. truncatum, Rhipicephalus evertsi mimeticus, and Amblyomma hebraeum, were inoculated intracoelomically with CCHF virus and assayed for virus content at varying times post-inoculation. The virus replicated in all 4 species, reaching maximum titers of 4.6-5.5(10) fluorescence focus units per ml on days 5-9 post-inoculation. Virus titers declined up to the molt, but increased slightly on emergence of adult ticks. Thereafter, virus titers declined progressively, but infectivity could still be detected in adult ticks for up to 205 days post-inoculation. Groups of H. m. rufipes, H. truncatum, and R.e. mimeticus infected adults were fed on susceptible sheep and successfully transmitted CCHF infection. CCHF virus was not isolated from pools of the larval and nymphal progeny of the female ticks nor did the larvae transmit infection to guinea pigs by bite. CCHF virus failed to replicate in adults and nymphae of 3 argasid tick species, Argas walkerae, Ornithodorus porcinus porcinus, and O. savignyi, after intracoelomic inoculation and could be reisolated from the ticks no later than 1 day post-inoculation. The results suggest that all ixodid ticks are capable of transmitting CCHF virus but argasid ticks do not appear to be capable of serving as vectors.\r"

Two hundred patients, with a mean age of 66.6 years and almost half with malignancy, were allocated to receive either 5,000 IU unfractionated heparin plus 0.5 mg dihydroergotamine mesylate twice daily or 1,500 IU low-molecular weight heparin plus 0.5 mg dihydroergotamine mesylate once daily together with one placebo injection per day. Treatment was commenced 2 hours preoperatively and continued for at least 7 days. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis, determined by radiolabelled fibrinogen uptake and phlebography, was 11 percent in the unfractionated heparin plus dihydroergotamine mesylate group and 11.4 percent in the low-molecular weight heparin and dihydroergotamine mesylate group. Neither these figures nor those for major proximal thrombi proved significantly different. Of the four parameters used to assess hemorrhagic complications, only the decrease in postoperative hemoglobin levels in the low-molecular weight and dihydroergotamine mesylate group reached statistical significance. These results indicate that once-daily prophylaxis with a combination of low-molecular weight heparin and dihydroergotamine is safe, effective, and convenient in high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.\r"

Glyceryl trinitrate may be a more suitable agent for control of hypertension than sodium nitroprusside. We have developed a closed-loop system for the Atari 1040ST microcomputer to control arterial pressure by the simultaneous infusion of two vasodilators under computer control. Use of this system with glyceryl trinitrate and sodium nitroprusside in 24 patients who required vasodilators after cardiopulmonary bypass, revealed that hypertension was controlled by glyceryl trinitrate alone in 14 of the patients and 10 required supplementary sodium nitroprusside. The results suggest that glyceryl trinitrate is a suitable agent for control of hypertension after cardiac surgery in the majority of patients. They also show that a sizeable minority required additional sodium nitroprusside, and that an automated 'dual pump' system is a satisfactory method of administering two vasodilators in this way.\r"

When assessed using a sedation analog scale, flumazenil significantly decreased diazepam-induced sedation. In only two of the five patients with evidence of diazepam-induced depression of the ventilatory response to hypoxia was there significant reversal of this depression after flumazenil administration. Finally, patients in whom the duration of sedation with diazepam was shorter (78 +/- 14 minutes) had a significantly greater decrease in the slope of their hypoxic ventilatory response curve (1.3 +/- 0.8 L.min-1.%sat-1 [-43% from baseline]) than did patients with longer sedation times (145 +/- 37 minutes duration; 2.0 +/- 0.8 L.min-1.%sat-1 [-5% from baseline]). These data suggest that flumazenil, 1 mg intravenous, is only partially effective in reversing diazepam-induced depression of hypoxic ventilatory drive and that tolerance may develop to the respiratory depressant effects of diazepam.\r"

To evaluate the potential to reverse this consequence of pulmonary artery hypertension, the effects of short-term vasodilator treatment were compared with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or nitroglycerin (NTG) on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange. The two vasodilators were infused in ten patients with mild or moderate ARDS at a dosage rate achieving a 20% reduction of the mean arterial pressure. PCP was estimated by graphic analysis of the pulmonary artery occlusion curve, and continuous ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) distributions were assessed using the multiple inert gas technique. At the given dosages both drugs induced equivalent reductions of the mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) from 28.2 +/- 3.6 to 23.7 +/- 3.2 with PGE1 and to 23.4 +/- 3.2 mmHg with NTG. The right atrial and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) were also decreased to the same extent associated with the expected decrease in PCP from 17.4 +/- 2.6 to 15.1 +/- 3.3 with PGE1 and to 15.6 +/- 2.7 mmHg with NTG. The estimated PCP values were closely correlated with the values calculated according to Gaar's equation (r = 0.822. n = 23, P less than 0.001) with a regression close to the identity line. The contribution of pulmonary venous resistances to the resistance of the whole pulmonary vascular bed computed as the ratio (PCP- PAWP)/(PAP-PAWP) was 0.28 and remained unchanged during vasodilator infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence and coexistence of viruses and bacterial organisms causing pharyngitis in adults. DESIGN: Open study using diagnostic methods, including rapid antigen-detection techniques, to test for the presence of viruses of the respiratory tract, as well as Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Chlamydia trachomatis, the Chlamydia species strain TWAR, and beta-hemolytic streptococci. SETTING: Open health care. PATIENTS: One hundred six consecutive adult patients, 15 to 65 years old, whose chief complaint was sore throat. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 106 patients, beta-hemolytic streptococci were found in only 24 patients (5 patients with group A streptococci, 13 with group C, 5 with group G, and 1 with group F); M. pneumoniae was found in 10 patients, the Chlamydia species strain TWAR in 9 patients, and viruses in 27 patients. Two microbes were simultaneously isolated in 3 patients, and no microbial findings were detected in 33 patients. CONCLUSION: Because 19 patients were infected with the Chlamydia species strain TWAR and M. pneumoniae, and 24 patients were infected with beta-hemolytic streptococci, the diagnostic procedures and therapies for adult patients with pharyngitis need to be reconsidered. The results of our study also confirm earlier suggestions that the Chlamydia species strain TWAR alone is a causative agent for pharyngitis in adults.\r"

  ".W": "After receiving N,N',N''-triethylenethiophosphoramide (thiotepa) and cyclophosphamide intravenously, five women with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast developed a patterned hyperpigmentation confined to skin occluded by adhesive-containing materials. Determinations of thiotepa concentrations in occluded and nonoccluded skin, plasma, bandage with adhesive, and gauze containing sweat were performed. The results suggest that this alkylating agent is excreted onto the skin surface in sweat, accumulates beneath adhesive-containing bandages and electrocardiogram pads, and exerts a local toxic effect resulting in hyperpigmentation.\r"

The most common type was hepatitis A, of which there were 281 cases, 81% of the total; there were 41 in the under 4 years old age group (63% of that group), 99 in the 5-8 year old age group (87% of that group) and 141 in the 8-12 year old age group (83% of that group). Hepatitis B occurred in 29 (8% of the total), and non-A, non-B hepatitis occurred in 35 (10%). All the children with hepatitis A and all but one with hepatitis B recovered. There were three deaths from fulminant hepatitis, one in the group with hepatitis B and two with non-A, non-B. Clearance of the hepatitis B surface antigen was fast, by six months 26 patients having cleared the antigen and 21 (77%) being positive for hepatitis B surface antibody. One patient became a carrier of hepatitis B surface antigen.\r"

  ".W": "The spontaneous secretion of growth hormone during a 24 hour period and the response of growth hormone to growth hormone releasing hormone was studied in 13 girls who had received treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia that included cranial irradiation with 20-24 Gy in 12-14 fractions. At the time of investigation the girls were at varying stages of puberty and had normal concentrations of thyroid hormones. The mean interval between the end of treatment and investigation was 4.6 years. The mean age at onset of the disease was 3.2 years and at investigation 10.7 years. The average attained height equalled -0.3 SD at onset, and -1.0 SD at the time of investigation. Secretion of growth hormone was substantially reduced compared with controls and did not increase during puberty. A prompt rise in growth hormone secretion was seen after injection of growth hormone releasing hormone, but the mean maximum growth hormone concentration was, however, only 25 mU/l. There was no correlation between the 24 hour secretion and growth hormone response to growth hormone releasing hormone, or the time since irradiation. These results confirm earlier work that suggested that girls who had received treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, that included cranial irradiation, have a comparative growth hormone insufficiency characterised by normal prepubertal growth and slow growth during puberty because of an inability to respond to the increased demands for growth hormone at that time.\r"

  ".W": "Five volunteer male subjects who were 24 to 78 y of age exposed the skin of their forearm to mercury vapor (203Hg) at concentrations of 0.88-2.14 ng/cm3 for periods of 27-43 min. Approximately 216 to 844 ng was taken up by the skin at rates of 0.0101 to 0.0402 ng Hg per cm2 per min per ng Hg per cm3 air. About half of the mercury taken up was shed by desquamation of epidermal cells during several weeks. The remainder diffused into the general circulation and could be measured as systemic mercury. When the total skin area (of which the forearm skin was assumed to be representative) was compared to the lung as a route of entry for mercury vapor at the same concentration, the rate of uptake was estimated to be 2.2% of the rate of uptake by the lung. A model is proposed that describes the growth and loss of skin-derived systemic mercury.\r"

  ".W": "Enteral diets with different protein content were tested to determine their effect on outcome in a model of protracted bacterial peritonitis. Hartley guinea pigs were provided with gastrostomies, and 1 week later, osmotic pumps were implanted into the peritoneal cavity to allow for continuous release of live bacteria over the course of 1 week. Three days after pump implantation, the animals began receiving isocaloric enteral diets that contained 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% of total calories as protein. After 2 weeks of observation, the survivors were killed. All animals lost weight during the 2-weeks period, but there was no difference in weight lost. Nitrogen balance correlated with dietary protein. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the groups that received 15% and 20% of total calories compared with the group that received 5% (p less than 0.05). Although dietary protein in the 5% group was insufficient for meeting the nutritional needs of the animal, survival was best in this group. Possible explanations are that protein restriction in this model may either augment host defence or impair bacterial virulence.\r"
