Plasma noradrenaline and renin concentrations are reduced. Hemodynamic disturbances are minor with a near-normal cardiovascular response to standing, exercise and volume depletion. The main problems are due to central adverse effects, particularly sedation, and a syndrome of sympathetic overactivity on sudden withdrawal. These problems can be minimized by using lower doses, while therapy with a useful antihypertensive drug is maintained. Clonidine and its analogs have a low toxicity and very few contraindications. They remain a useful part of the therapeutic armamentarium in hypertension.\r"

Comparative studies on the antihypertensive potency of selective alpha 2 agonists like rilmenidine, guanfacine, clonidine and lofexidine suggest that the relative ability to bind to alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenoceptors is not critical but the ability to enter the central nervous system is essential for antihypertensive efficacy.\r"

Pharmacologic data concerning its hemodynamic and central nervous system effects in the rat are described in this report. In the anesthetized or conscious spontaneously hypertensive rat, rilmenidine was found effective and potent as an antihypertensive agent, lowering blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner after intravenous and oral administration. These effects are related to a reduction in sympathetic tone as seen by the decrease in plasma catecholamines induced by rilmenidine in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Studies in the normotensive pithed rat (electrical stimulation and adrenalectomization) confirmed the presynaptic alpha 2-stimulating properties of rilmenidine and suggested that a component of the antihypertensive activity of rilmenidine could be exerted through these peripheral receptors. A study of the central effects of rilmenidine was performed using classic neuropharmacologic tests. No effect was observed on the pentobarbitone-induced sleeping time in the rat. Rilmenidine caused only a minimal and non-dose-dependent inhibition of the righting reflex in the chick. In the rat, rilmenidine did not decrease the motor activity at concentrations up to 50 times higher than the antihypertensive dose. These results confirmed the contrast between rilmenidine and clonidine and suggest that a dissociation between sedative and antihypertensive effects could occur with rilmenidine.\r"

The effect of the 2 drugs was also studied in vitro on brain slices containing LC cells. Rilmenidine and clonidine inhibited the firing of LC and DR neurons. Complementary experiments performed with yohimbine and prazosin demonstrated that the effect of LC is related to an agonistic action on alpha 2 somatodendritic receptors, whereas the effect observed on DR cells is indirect. On LC cells, clonidine is 30 to 60 times as potent as rilmenidine. These observations may be related to less sedative effects of rilmenidine than of clonidine.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction between adrenergic systems and opiate receptors or neuronal systems linked to these receptors has been previously demonstrated. For this reason, clonidine can be used to reduce withdrawal syndrome to opiates. Rilmenidine (S 3341) is a new agonist of alpha 2 adrenoceptors. The purpose of these experiments was to compare the effects of rilmenidine and clonidine on morphine withdrawal syndrome and their potential addictive properties in the rat. Rats were made morphine-dependent by repeated intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of increasing doses of morphine. Withdrawal was precipitated by injecting naloxone subcutaneously. Withdrawal scores were evaluated for 10 minutes. Clonidine (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) and rilmenidine (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced overall withdrawal scores. Addictive potential was evaluated in the rat by a place preference test after the following treatments (mg/kg, i.p.): rilmenidine 0.1 to 5, clonidine 0.01 to 0.5, heroin 0.12, and d-amphetamine 1.5. Rilmenidine did not modify the time spent in the conditioned side at doses of 0.1 to 1 and 5 mg/kg, but increased it at 2.5 mg/kg (+25%). In contrast, a reinforcing effect was induced by clonidine (+21%, +43%, +34% at 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 mg/kg), heroin (+39%) and amphetamine (+52%). In conclusion, rilmenidine as well as clonidine reduced the morphine withdrawal syndrome. However, rilmenidine was 100 times less active than clonidine. Clonidine, heroin and d-amphetamine have clear reinforcing properties. Rilmenidine did not exhibit dose-dependent reinforcing properties and the isolated effect noted after 2.5 mg/kg is difficult to interpret because it is minor and is not observed with a higher dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study compared the effects of continuous 10-day infusions of clonidine (5 micrograms/kg/hour) with those of rilmenidine (100 micrograms/kg/hour) on various cardiovascular and behavioral parameters in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. The changes in these parameters after cessation of the infusions were also compared. At these rates of infusion, clonidine and rilmenidine produced quantitatively similar reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP), lability of MAP and cardiovascular responsiveness during normal behaviors such as eating and grooming. Neither drug infusion affected heart rate. The cessation of the clonidine infusion resulted in a \"withdrawal\" syndrome characterized by prominent rapid eye movement-sleep rebound, and cardiovascular and behavioral disturbances including an increased lability of MAP, exaggerated cardiovascular responses during normal behaviors, tachycardia, and an \"opiate abstinence-like\" syndrome including head and body shakes. Cessation of rilmenidine infusion resulted in somewhat similar cardiovascular and behavioral disturbances, but unlike clonidine there was a return to normal rapid eye movement sleep without rebound.\r"

Six groups of at least 6 guinea pigs were pretreated with saline, rilmenidine (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg intravenously) or clonidine (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg intravenously), respectively. Conductance, dynamic compliance and static compliance of the respiratory system were measured before and during histamine infusion (80 ng/kg/s) and expressed as percent variation. Clonidine potentiated HIB as previously reported. In contrast, rilmenidine potentiated HIB only at the dose of 1 mg/kg. As it is well known that HIB is influenced by adrenergic outflow, these results suggest that rilmenidine has less inhibitory effect than clonidine on adrenal secretion.\r"

The pharmacokinetic parameters were investigated after single or repeated administration in healthy subjects, using labeled and unlabeled compounds. Rilmenidine was rapidly and extensively absorbed, with an absolute bioavailability factor close to 1 and a maximal plasma concentration achieved within 2 hours. Rilmenidine was not subject to presystemic metabolism. Distribution was independent of the free fraction because rilmenidine was weakly bound to plasma proteins (less than 10%). The volume of distribution was approximately 5 l.kg-1 (315 liters). Elimination was rapid with a total body plasma clearance of approximately 450 ml.min-1 and an elimination half-life of approximately 8 hours. Renal excretion was the major elimination process (two-thirds of the total clearance). Metabolism was very poor, with a renal elimination of rilmenidine as the parent drug (urinary fraction of rilmenidine was about 65% and no metabolite plasma levels were detected). Linear pharmacokinetics were demonstrated for rilmenidine from 0.5 to 2 mg but, at 3 mg, a slight deviation from linearity was observed. In repeated administration, the linear disposition of rilmenidine with dose was confirmed.\r"

  ".W": "Rilmenidine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, was studied (1 mg single dose) in order to determine the effects of pathology on its basic pharmacokinetic parameters. Because of the mainly renal elimination of rilmenidine, studies involved hypertensive, elderly hypertensive, renal insufficient and hepatic insufficient patients. Hypertension was found to influence neither the absorption, the distribution nor the elimination processes; the linearity in the range of 1 to 2 mg and the absence of accumulation in long-term treatment were confirmed. In contrast, in the elderly, the absorption phase was delayed. The slight decrease in the apparent volume of distribution (-12%), with a notable decrease in the apparent total clearance (-50%) led to a prolonged elimination half-life (+50%). In renal failure, linear relations between the degree of renal impairment and the elimination parameters were shown. These relations allow the evaluation of the predicted steady-state level of rilmenidine for a given degree of renal failure. In hepatic insufficiency, the modification of rilmenidine disposition concerned exclusively the elimination phase in which apparent clearance was decreased approximately 20%. In conclusion, these results lead to a decreased dosage regimen in patients with severe renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "Most alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists developed so far will penetrate into the brain, thus causing central hypotensive activity, mediated by the stimulation of alpha 2 adrenoceptors in the region of the nucleus tractus solitarii, the vasomotor center and the nucleus of the vagus nerve. The central alpha 2 adrenoceptors are probably located at postjunctional (postsynaptic) sites. Their stimulation causes sympathoinhibition and thus a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. The central hypotensive effect is the dominating activity of all alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists developed so far, of which clonidine, guanfacine and alpha-methyl-DOPA (which is converted into alpha-methyl-noradrenaline) are the prototypes. Peripheral postsynaptic effects probably do not greatly contribute to the hypotensive activity of these drugs. Sedation, also mediated by central alpha 2 adrenoceptors is the major adverse reaction to these antihypertensive agents. More selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (B-HT 920, azepexole, UK 14,304) appear to display the same pattern of hypotensive and sedative activities as the nonselective compounds like clonidine. After the general survey on centrally acting alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonistic drugs, the pharmacologic profile of the new oxazoline derivative, rilmenidine, (S 3341) was compared with that of the classic compound, clonidine. In all current animal and in vitro models, rilmenidine was characterized as a clonidine-like, centrally acting antihypertensive drug. Thus, its central hypotensive activity proved mediated by the stimulation of central alpha 2 adrenoceptors. In radioligand binding studies, rilmenidine proved somewhat more selective for alpha 2 adrenoceptors, but this selectivity was not reflected by a clearly different pharmacologic profile of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two studies were performed in a double-blind manner: study I in 8 healthy subjects and study II in 10 hypertensive patients. In the course of five 24-hour periods, each separated by at least 1 week, the following 5 treatments were administered in a random order: placebo, rilmenidine (0.5, 1, 2 and 3 mg). Blood pressure was measured with a Roche arteriosonde (study I) or a sphygmomanometer (study II). Sedation was measured using a visual analog scale. Dry mouth was assessed by measuring the salivary flow (study I) or by visual analog scale (study II). Plasma concentration of rilmenidine was assayed by gas chromatography linked with mass spectrometry. The antihypertensive and sedative effects (area under curve) were directly related to the dose and to the log of the plasma concentration of rilmenidine. In contrast to the 2- and 3-mg doses, rilmenidine (0.5 and 1 mg) did not induce orthostatic hypotension, a significant decrease in heart rate or a significant dryness of mouth. At doses of 0.5 and 1 mg, the effects of rilmenidine on sedation were not consistent in both studies: sedation was significant in study I but did not differ from placebo in study II. These studies show that rilmenidine, in common with other alpha 2 agonists, decreases blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner, in normotensive as well as in hypertensive subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

From the third to the fifth hour, the decrease in mean arterial pressure was maintained, CI was higher than initial values and TPR decreased, indicating a persistent vasodilator effect. On day 28, hemodynamic variations were similar but of a lower amplitude. Before administration on day 28, a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic BP was observed, demonstrating that the antihypertensive activity of 1 mg was maintained for 24 hours, with a significant reduction in TPR and no modification of CI or stroke index.

  ".W": "The effects of a new alpha 2 agonist (S 3341 or rilmenidine) on blood pressure (BP), glycemic control, lipid metabolism and renal function were investigated during a 16-week open study in 29 insulin-treated diabetic patients with mild to moderate hypertension. There were 17 men and 12 women aged 50.9 +/- 2.2 years (mean +/- standard error of the mean). Duration of diabetes and insulin therapy was 218 +/- 24 and 143 +/- 30 months. After 2 weeks of placebo, systolic and diastolic BP was 165 +/- 3 and 97 +/- 0.5 mm Hg, respectively (supine). Rilmenidine (S 3341) given alone at daily doses of 1 or 2 mg according to the clinical response led to a prompt and sustained decrease of systolic and diastolic BP (159 +/- 4 and 88 +/- 1 mm Hg after 2 weeks; 149 +/- 3 and 85 +/- 1 mm Hg after 12 weeks; p less than 0.01). Seventeen patients (59%) had normal BP (systolic BP less than 160; diastolic BP less than 90 mm Hg, supine) after 12 weeks of S 3341. Diuretics were associated with S 3341 for the nonresponders at week 12; this led to normalization of BP in 90% of the patients at the end of the study. Glycemic control was assessed by home glucose monitoring (5 determinations/1 day per week), 24-hour glucosuria and postprandial plasma glucose at the outpatient clinic (n = 7) as well as by the measurement of the glycosylated hemoglobin. None of these parameters was significantly affected by S 3341.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Items from previous surveys in 1970 and 1979 were included to permit analysis of time trends in management. Median hospital stay dropped from 21 days in 1970 to 9 days in 1987. Use of beta blockers and aspirin doubled between 1979 and 1987, while use of anticoagulation and sulfinpyrazone dropped 4- to 10-fold. In 1987, coronary angiography was used commonly, especially in younger patients or those with either a non-Q-wave AMI, intravenous thrombolytic therapy or a positive exercise test. These findings document the increasingly aggressive approach to the management of patients with uncomplicated AMI.\r"

Men with uncomplicated angina pectoris (AP) (n = 167) derived from this population had an incidence of fatal and nonfatal CAD events 3 times higher than that of men without AP or myocardial infarction (n = 5,774). Men with myocardial infarction with or without AP had an incidence of CAD events 7 to 8 times higher than that of men without AP or myocardial infarction. Similar differences were found for new cases of uncomplicated AP (n = 128) and myocardial infarction detected at a second screening after 4 years and followed for 7.3 years. Pooled data from this series of men with uncomplicated AP showed the following factors to be associated in multivariate analysis with nonfatal or fatal CAD endpoints during follow-up: elevated serum cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, smoking and attack score. The risk increase associated with the first 3 factors was similar to the general population. These findings indicate that the same factors affecting prognosis after a first appearance of AP affect similarly patients with myocardial infarction and clinically healthy subjects. Preventive measures against these risk factors seem to be of similar importance among patients with AP, post-infarct patients and healthy subjects.\r"

To investigate the utility of Doppler assessment of LV diastolic function with exercise, 28 consecutive patients underwent digital stress echocardiography, including measurement of mitral flow velocity by pulsed-wave Doppler and simultaneous stress thallium imaging. The mean mitral flow velocity was measured as the integrated area under the LV diastolic inflow Doppler spectral display. The change in mean mitral flow velocity from baseline to immediate postexercise was compared among 3 patient groups: (1) patients with thallium redistribution or exercise-induced wall-motion abnormalities, or both, consistent with exercise-induced ischemia (n = 18), (2) patients with no evidence of stress-induced ischemia, with or without resting wall-motion abnormalities (n = 10), and (3) 10 control subjects of similar age with normal resting 12-lead electrocardiograms, normal resting and postexercise 2-dimensional echocardiograms and normal electrocardiographic treadmill stress testing. The percent increase in mean mitral flow velocity was 101% (+/- 59) for controls and 86% (+/- 53) for patients without stress-induced ischemia versus 33% (+/- 24) in patients with stress-induced ischemia (p less than 0.005). An increase in mean mitral flow velocity with exercise of greater than 50% correctly identified 9 of 10 nonischemic control patients. An increase in mean velocity of less than 50% predicted ischemia in 15 of 18 patients with evidence of stress-induced ischemia (p less than 0.005) Thus, Doppler assessment of LV diastolic function with exercise expressed as a change in the mean velocity of mitral flow is a useful indicator of stress-induced ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "To study the influence of ischemia on both early and late left ventricular filling, Doppler 2-dimensional echocardiography was used to measure filling parameters during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in 26 patients. Doppler recordings were taken immediately before balloon inflation and continuously during balloon inflation and deflation until 60 seconds into the recovery period. During PTCA of the left anterior descending artery (16 patients) there was a 35% decrease in early peak filling rate from 269 +/- 88 to 169 +/- 55 ml/s (p less than 0.0005) by 60 seconds of balloon inflation. In patients undergoing PTCA of the left circumflex (4 patients) or dominant right coronary artery (6 patients), the early peak filling rate decreased 15% from 325 +/- 126 to 284 +/- 137 ml/s (p less than 0.005). The decrease in early peak filling rate became evident at approximately 15 seconds after balloon inflation and fully recovered 20 seconds after balloon deflation. Rather than an expected increase in atrial stroke volume and a decrease in early to late filling ratio during coronary occlusion, there was a 28% decrease in atrial stroke volume during left anterior descending coronary artery PTCA and a 6% decrease during right coronary and circumflex PTCA. Because of the simultaneous decrease in both early and late ventricular filling, peak early to late filling ratio was only slightly altered during PTCA. There was an 83% increase in mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure during balloon inflation from 12 +/- 5 to 20 +/- 4 mm Hg. In 11 of these patients global systolic function was measured on subsequent inflations during PTCA using 2-dimensional echocardiography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Morphologic changes were evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography (automated edge-detection) and theoretical pressure drop across the dilated and stented stenosis was calculated from the Poiseuille formula, with turbulent resistances assuming a coronary blood flow of 1 or 3 ml/s. Eleven patients (ages 41 to 69 years, mean 55) were studied before and after angioplasty, and immediately after stent implantation. The stented coronary artery was the left anterior descending artery in 9 patients and the left circumflex in 2. Following stent implantation, an additional increase in minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the dilated vessel was observed, suggesting that the self-expanding stainless-steel endoprosthesis used had a dilating function in addition to its stenting role. Repeat angiography in 6 patients 3 months after stent implantation showed a decrease in the minimal luminal cross-sectional area without a significant change in theoretic pressure decrease. This slight reduction in vessel caliber had no hemodynamically significant repercussions. Thus, stenting of coronary arteries following dilatation is a potentially valuable technique for preventing both abrupt closure and late reduction in lumen diameter.\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged circulatory support with an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) is controversial, in part because it has not been performed frequently enough to base treatment policy on adequate data. To help clarify this problem, 733 cases of consecutive patients who were supported by IABP between 1967 and 1982 were analyzed. Twenty-seven patients were supported for 20 days or more (range 20 to 71). Twelve (44%) had prior histories of chronic congestive heart failure. Complications were more frequent in prolonged-support patients than in those assisted for less than 20 days (vascular, 37% vs 15%, p = 0.001; infectious, 67% vs 25%, p = 0.0001; and bleeding, 26% vs 15%, p = 0.04, respectively). The survival rate of prolonged-support patients, however, was 63% (17 of 27), essentially the same as that of the controls (57%, p = 0.5). Of 17 prolonged-pumping patients discharged alive from the hospital, 9 died within 6 months but 8 survived greater than 2 years. Among congestive heart failure patients, none was a long-term survivor. Prolonged IABP support in congestive heart failure patients lacking surgically correctable lesions can extend life while arrangements for definitive therapy are made (transplant, permanent mechanical assistance). Where definitive therapy is unavailable, IABP may provide additional months of life.\r"

VPCs of the most frequent QRS morphology and the second most frequent QRS morphology were compared with respect to the procainamide level at the escape of VPCs from 85% suppression and the duration of suppression measured from the onset of the procainamide infusion. In 8 patients, VPCs of the most frequent QRS morphology remained suppressed at lower procainamide concentrations and for longer times than did VPCs of the second most frequent QRS morphology (escape procainamide concentration = 2.8 +/- 1.7 versus 5.4 +/- 2.3 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.025; time to escape 244 +/- 138 versus 98 +/- 114 min; p less than 0.05).

Thus, in individual patients there are specific patterns of suppression of VPCs of different QRS morphologies which are independent of the frequency of each morphology. There is apparently a differential pharmacologic effect of procainamide on the foci or pathways responsible for the different QRS morphologies of multiform VPCs.\r"

In this study, the effectiveness of external noninvasive temporary pacing was compared with traditional endocardial burst ventricular pacing for the termination of sustained and hemodynamically stable VT. In 14 patients, 16 VT morphologies induced by programmed right ventricular extrastimulation were reproducibly terminated by endocardial burst pacing (3 to 9 complexes). VT cycle lengths averaged 392 +/- 97 ms (standard deviation) and ranged from 300 to 690 ms. The endocardial burst pacing cycle length used to terminate VT averaged 298 +/- 93 ms (range 220 to 600 ms). External burst pacing terminated 14 of 16 VT morphologies (88%). The pacing cycle length used to terminate these 14 VTs averaged 282 +/- 44 ms. The number of ventricular captures ranged from 5 to 20 beats. Failure to terminate 2 VT morphologies probably represented a failure of the device to capture the ventricle. Acceleration of VT occurred in 1 patient with burst external noninvasive pacing. These observations suggest that external burst pacing may be an effective means of terminating sustained VT in some patients.\r"

During follow-up of a mean of 16 months (range 1 to 72), there were 65 arrhythmia recurrences, 34 of them fatal, in 58 patients. Multivariate regression analysis showed that inducibility at initial study of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrilation was an independent predictor of total arrhythmia recurrence (p less than 0.0001) and fatal arrhythmia recurrence (p = 0.02). At 1 year, 25 +/- 5% of patients with an inducible arrhythmia had a fatal arrhythmia recurrence compared with only 4 +/- 4% of patients without (p = 0.003). The nature of the inducible arrhythmia had no additional predictive value. Inducibility or noninducibility of ventricular arrhythmias at initial electrophysiologic study is a powerful, independent predictor of subsequent arrhythmia recurrence in survivors of cardiac arrest. Patients without inducible arrhythmias have a low frequency of fatal arrhythmia recurrence.\r"

Dual balloon valvuloplasty was performed using 2 balloons advanced and inflated simultaneously across the stenotic aortic valve orifice. For the group as a whole, the average peak transvalvular gradient was reduced from 79 +/- 8 to 57 +/- 7 mm Hg (mean +/- standard error) using a single balloon (p less than 0.0005), and reduced further to 36 +/- 4 mm Hg using dual balloons (p less than 0.0005 compared with single balloon results). Similarly, calculated aortic valve orifice area was increased from 0.45 +/- 0.04 to 0.57 +/- 0.05 cm2 using a single balloon (p less than 0.0005), and further increased to 0.77 +/- 0.06 cm2 using dual balloons (p less than 0.0005). Dual balloon dilation caused no complications directly attributable to the use of 2 balloons, including no exacerbation of aortic regurgitation. These results suggest that dual balloon valvuloplasty is safe and efficacious in selected patients with aortic stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier studies have suggested that mitral regurgitation (MR) augments early left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling. To determine whether MR affects early diastolic filling in patients with abnormal diastolic filling, transmitral pulsed-wave Doppler recordings were used to study 32 normal subjects, 21 patients with LV hypertrophy, 23 with LV hypertrophy and MR and 15 patients with MR. Patients with MR had increased peak early filling velocities (MR 108 +/- 27 cm/s, normal 80 +/- 16 cm/s, p less than 0.01), peak atrial filling velocities (MR 72 +/- 18 cm/s, normal 55 +/- 12 cm/s, p less than 0.05) and increased deceleration rates (MR 5.0 +/- 1.9 m/s2, normal 3.5 +/- 1.2 m/s2, p less than 0.05). Patients with LV hypertrophy had reduced peak early filling velocities (69 +/- 14 cm/s, p less than 0.05) and increased peak atrial filling velocities (83 +/- 16 cm/s, p less than 0.001). There was also an increase in the atrial filling fraction and reduction in the rapid filling fraction as compared with normal patients. Patients with LV hypertrophy and MR had increased peak early filling velocities (98 +/- 26 cm/s, p less than 0.01 vs normal, p less than 0.001 vs LV hypertrophy patients), increased atrial filling velocities (84 +/- 27 cm/s, p less than 0.001 vs normal), increased deceleration rates (4.4 +/- 2.4 m/s2, p less than 0.05 vs normal) and a normal distribution of diastolic filling. Within the LV hypertrophy and MR group, diastolic filling parameters were similar when patients were subgrouped on the basis of auscultability of MR. MR augments early diastolic filling and may tend to normalize diastolic filling patterns in LV hypertrophy patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The hemodynamic responses to exercise in postoperative patients with PR was determined using Doppler-measured regurgitant fraction to indicate PR severity. Maximal heart rate, oxygen consumption and workload capacity were measured during upright cycle ergometry. Cardiac output was measured at rest and during submaximal supine cycle ergometry by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Oxygen consumption was simultaneously measured and exercise factor was calculated as the change in cardiac output per change in oxygen consumption. Twenty-seven patients were compared with 17 age-, size- and sex-matched control subjects. Patients with PR had larger right ventricles (p less than or equal to 0.001), lower heart rate response (p less than or equal to 0.05), lower maximal oxygen consumption (p less than or equal to 0.005) and lower workloads (p less than or equal to 0.005) when compared with normal control subjects during maximal exercise testing. Exercise factor was the same for both groups. Patients with PR were then separated into mild, moderate and severe groups. Patients with mild PR had a normal response to exercise. However, patients with moderate and severe PR had lower maximal oxygen consumptions and maximal workloads than control subjects. Control, mild and moderate PR groups had similar exercise factors. Patients with severe PR had markedly low cardiac output responses. PR is associated with reduced exercise capability, which is related to the severity of the PR.\r"

This series represents 16% of the patients undergoing the modified Fontan operation during that period. Of the 77 patients (46 men and 31 women), 29 had tricuspid atresia, 30 had double-inlet ventricle and 18 had other complex lesions. There were 5 (6%) hospital deaths, compared with 67 (17%) for patients of all ages undergoing the Fontan operation during the same period. Patient age 18 years and older was not a significant risk factor. There were 8 late deaths. Detailed follow-up data were available on 61 (95%) survivors from 5 months to 12 years (mean 4 years) postoperatively. Fifty-seven (93%) of the patients were in New York Heart Association class I or II, 20 (33%) were taking no medication and 11 (18%) were taking digoxin alone. Seventeen (28%) patients complained of persistent ascites or edema. The study indicated that (1) the modified Fontan operation can be performed with low mortality in adults, (2) the long-term outcome is favorable and (3) persistent ascites or edema may be a problem in some patients.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that tissue oxygen delivery would be affected by diminished oxygen stores in cyanotic congenital heart disease, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, red cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), P50, blood gases, oxygen saturations and systemic oxygen transport were measured in 29 hypoxemic infants and children. For the group, aortic saturation was 81 +/- 9%, PaO2 was 50 +/- 12 mm Hg, hemoglobin 16.2 +/- 2.1 gm/dl and systemic oxygen transport 620 +/- 145 ml/min/m2. P50 was increased above normal values (28.8 +/- 2.3 vs 26.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and DPG was 2.35 +/- 0.54 mumol/ml, at the upper limits of normal for this assay. Iron deficiency was present in 8. When patients with P50 greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg and P50 less than 30 mm Hg were compared, iron stores were diminished in the high P50 group: [serum ferritin (19 +/- 8 vs 53 +/- 48 ng/ml, p = 0.0006), transferrin saturation (11 +/- 6 vs 23 +/- 11%, p = 0.003) and MCV (79 +/- 8 vs 86 +/- 4 fl, p = 0.05)]. Hemoglobin, aortic oxygen saturation, PaO2 and systemic oxygen transport were similar in both groups. In children with iron sufficiency, 15 of 21 had MCV greater than 90th percentile for age and sex (p less than 0.001 versus expected distribution). Also, MCV greater than 90th percentile for age and sex had a positive predictive value of 0.88 for iron sufficiency. This study demonstrates that diminished iron stores in cyanotic congenital heart disease are associated with a more right-shifted oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (increased P50).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-three patients underwent surgical correction of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) between 1973 and 1986. There were 46 boys and 37 girls. Median age at operation was 60 days (1 to 240) and median weight 3.9 kg (1 to 22). The anatomic types encountered included infracardiac connection (16 patients), supracardiac connection (32) and pulmonary venous drainage connected directly to the coronary sinus (27). Mixed anomalous drainage or pulmonary venous return connected directly to the right atrium occurred in 8 patients. Diagnosis was established by cardiac catheterization and angiography (56 patients), clinical examination (3) and cross-sectional echocardiography alone in 24 of the last consecutive 28 patients. Pulmonary hypertension was present in 26 (55%) of those who underwent cardiac catheterization. The median pulmonary vascular resistance was 4.2 units/m2 (body surface area) for all the patients, whereas in those with infracardiac pulmonary venous connection the median value was 10 units/m2. The median interval between admission and operation was 72 hours. Surgical correction was performed using profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest in 68; for the remainder, conventional cardiopulmonary bypass with profound to moderate hypothermia was used. Ten patients developed 1 or more pulmonary hypertensive crises during the early postoperative period. These were diagnosed in 8 by direct pulmonary artery pressure measurement and in 2 by clinical examination. Late reoperation was necessary in 6 patients (10%). Analyses of risk factors for 30-day survival for all patients showed that the risk of early death was associated with the type of anomaly (infradiaphragmatic), occurrence of pulmonary hypertensive crises, year of the operation, set of the patient and pressure of preoperative congestive heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study determined whether noninvasive electrical impedance cardiography accurately measures systemic blood flow (cardiac output) in children with congenital heart defects. A total of 37 patients ranging in age from 2 to 171 months underwent complete right- and left-sided heart catheterizations that included simultaneous Fick and impedance measurement of cardiac output. Based on the diagnosis, 4 groups were formed consisting of a control group (n = 11) with no shunts, a group with intracardiac left-to-right shunting and an atrial septal defect (n = 7), another with a ventricular septal defect (n = 12) and an extracardiac left-to-right shunting with patent ductus arteriosus group (n = 7). Impedance values for systemic blood flow were compared with systemic and pulmonary blood flow obtained by the direct Fick method with measured oxygen consumption. The difference between impedance and Fick systemic blood flow was less than or equal to 5% in each of the 4 groups. The highest correlation between impedance and Fick systemic blood flow was with the atrial septal defect group (r = 0.89) and lowest with the ventricular septal defect and control (r = 0.69) groups. Fick pulmonary blood flow was significantly greater than impedance or Fick systemic flow in all 3 shunt groups. Impedance cardiography accurately measured systemic blood flow in children without shunts or valvular insufficiency. Likewise, systemic blood flow was accurately measured by impedance in the presence of intracardiac left-to-right shunts (atrial and ventricular septal defects) and extracardiac left-to-right shunts (patent ductus arteriosus).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The influence of an increase in heart rate on left ventricular (LV) contractile performance was assessed in patients with normal LV function. In 19 patients (3 men, 16 women) ages 55 +/- 9 years (mean +/- standard deviation) with normal global and segmental LV function and normal coronary arteries, LV dP/dt max was measured at baseline heart rate and during atrial pacing at baseline +5, baseline +25 and baseline +45 beats/min. In 10 of the patients, intravascular volume was not altered during pacing and, as a result, echocardiographically measured LV end-diastolic dimension decreased (5.4 +/- 0.4 at baseline vs 4.9 +/- 0.5 cm at baseline +45 beats/min, p less than 0.05). In these patients, LV dP/dt max increased modestly (1,571 +/- 237 at baseline vs 1,760 +/- 199 mm Hg/s at baseline +45 beats/min, p less than 0.05). In the other 9 patients, intravascular volume was expanded rapidly (by saline infusion) during pacing and, as a result, LV end-diastolic dimension was held constant (5.2 +/- 0.6 at baseline vs 5.1 +/- 0.6 cm at baseline +45 beats/min, difference not significant). In these patients, LV dP/dt max increased substantially with pacing (1,505 +/- 228 at baseline vs 2,050 +/- 258 mm Hg/s at baseline +45 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Thus, an increase in heart rate induces a modest increase in LV dP/dt max in patients in whom LV preload (as reflected by end-diastolic dimension) is allowed to decrease; in contrast, it causes a marked increase in LV dP/dt max in those in whom LV preload is maintained constant.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of autonomic tone on left ventricular (LV) contractility, along with the range of normal values and the effects of exercise on contractile state, were studied in 12 normal volunteers. Serial reproducibility was examined in a subgroup of 6. LV contractility was estimated by the LV peak-systolic pressure to end-systolic volume relation (pressure-volume relation), and the ratio of peak-systolic pressure to end-systolic volume (pressure/volume ratio). The cuff blood pressure and radionuclide ventriculogram were recorded at rest, during exercise and during pharmacologic pressure-afterloading with phenylephrine, before and after vagal and beta-adrenergic \"blockade.\" Both the pressure/volume ratio and ejection fraction increased during the stimulus of exercise (both p less than or equal to 0.008). After blockade, the pressure-volume relations were highly linear (r = 0.95 +/- 0.05 [standard deviation], n = 12), and there was no systematic difference in their slopes induced by blockade. The serial studies of pressure-volume relations showed no significant differences. The results demonstrated that vagal and sympathetic tone were not important in the support of LV contractility in normal subjects at rest, and that the pressure-volume relation and pressure/volume ratio are reproducible between studies. Also, the findings confirmed that both the pressure/volume ratio and the ejection fraction were sensitive to exercise-induced changes in contractility. This demonstration of intrinsic LV contractility in normal subjects, plus the reproducibility of the measurements, supports the feasibility of serial study of LV contractility.\r"

In the study of adoption, 52 men and women who had served for 6 months as controls for a study of moderate-intensity, home-based exercise training received 30 minutes of baseline instruction. They were then randomized to receive continuing instruction and support through 10 staff-initiated telephone contacts of 5 minutes each every 2 weeks, or to receive no telephone contacts. In subjects receiving telephone contacts, peak oxygen uptake increased significantly after 6 months, whereas no increase was observed in subjects receiving no staff support (p less than 0.05). In the maintenance study, 51 men and women who had significantly increased their peak oxygen uptake by 6 months of moderate-intensity, home-based exercise training were randomized to undergo daily self-monitoring and receive adherence instructions, or undergo weekly self-monitoring only, during a second 6-month period of training. Subjects performing daily self-monitoring reported completing significantly more exercise training sessions during the 6 months of training than subjects performing weekly self-monitoring; functional capacity in both groups remained higher than before training (p less than 0.05). Taken together, these studies suggest that brief baseline instruction followed by continuing telephone contact with staff can be used to help people adopt a moderate-intensity, home-based exercise training program that can be maintained by simple self-monitoring strategies.\r"

Levels of neutralizing activity, as well as those of rotavirus-specific antibodies detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were comparable for each socioeconomic group. Overall, neutralizing activity in human milk was detected in the majority of samples and can be increased many months postpartum. The prevalence of neutralization antibodies (titers, greater than or equal to 1:10) was 77% against Wa (serotype 1), 86% against SA-11 (serotype 3), and 75% against NCDV (bovine) rotavirus. Rotavirus-specific IgA and IgG antibodies detected by ELISA (titers, greater than or equal to 1:10) were present in 35% and 55% of breast milks, respectively. Sequential analysis of repeated breast milk samples from five individual mothers revealed that rotavirus neutralizing activity fluctuated over time, with high activity observed in one mother's milk at 18 months postpartum. Mothers who breast-fed for six months or more tended to have higher milk neutralizing titers against rotavirus.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the magnitude and cause of decreasing diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and pertussis (DTP) immunization rates, a retrospective cohort study investigated the immunization status against pertussis among 1-year-old children in Utah. Questionnaires were sent to the parents of 2975 children born in June 1985. Parents were asked about each child's DTP immunization status, including the number, type, and dates of the vaccinations, reasons for or against vaccination, and their knowledge of whooping cough and the vaccine. Children were considered adequately immunized against pertussis when they had received three DTP vaccinations by their first birthday. In Utah, the lack of pertussis immunization among young children is a serious problem: greater than 30% of 1-year-old children were not adequately protected. Accurate parental knowledge about the relative risks of vaccination and illness was associated with a greater likelihood for immunization. Although some parents chose to forego the vaccination because they were concerned about its side effects, the most common reason for incomplete immunization was illness at the time the vaccination was to be given. If immunization rates are to improve, health care professionals must not only make an effort to educate the general population regarding the vaccine, but they must also ensure immediate follow-up for immunization when the procedure is delayed.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients (age range, 3 to 17 years) with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia major were studied prospectively, beginning at the onset of chelation therapy with deferoxamine (desferrioxamine). A liver biopsy specimen was obtained from each patient at the start of the study, and periodically thereafter. Liver histologic features, iron content, and iron excretion were assessed during the course of the study. Hepatic iron levels from liver biopsy specimens appeared to correlate well with serum ferritin levels in the younger less heavily iron-loaded patients; however, in patients with higher serum ferritin levels, hepatic iron appeared to reach a saturation level. Fourteen of the 16 patients showed a pattern of marbled fibrosis of the liver in their initial biopsy specimens. Follow-up biopsy specimens from nearly all of the patients showed a substantial reduction in iron concentration, but only two of seven patients showed improvement in the degree of hepatic fibrosis three to five years later. Patients less than 8 years old exhibited a normal pattern of linear growth until approximately the age of 10 years, followed by a progressive decrease to the 30th to 40th percentile. Two patients, aged 18 and 22 years, died of cardiac disease during the study. These findings suggest that chelation therapy in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia needs to be initiated at an early age, possibly before 3 years, if significant liver fibrosis and growth impairment are to be effectively prevented.\r"

A variety of therapeutic modalities, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, have been utilized. Early recognition of a group of patients with PPHN who might require aggressive therapy would be clinically useful. Highest alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient at or near diagnosis was evaluated retrospectively in 53 patients with PPHN in relation to survival, aggressiveness of management, and frequency of pulmonary complications (air leak and broncho-pulmonary dysplasia). Highest alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was a good early predictor of nonsurvival and was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (mean [+/- SD], 618 +/- 23 mm Hg vs 521 +/- 128 mm Hg). Values of 600 mm Hg or greater were more frequent in the nonsurvivors compared with the survivors (92% vs 37%). Air leak also proved to be a good predictor of nonsurvival.\r"

This family illustrates both the marked variability of expression and the proposed X-linked dominant mode of inheritance of FDH. We postulate that early embryologic random inactivation of the X chromosome bearing the mutant gene responsible for FDH is the cause of the variable expression.\r"

Children with more severe malnutrition (ie, less than 50% of their expected weight) and with Cryptosporidium in their stools had a significantly longer duration of diarrhea than similarly malnourished children without Cryptosporidium (63 vs 32 days, respectively). In 77 better-nourished outpatients with diarrhea, Cryptosporidium was found in only 5.2% of cases and was associated with less-severe illness. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that in less-developed areas, Cryptosporidium is a major pathogen, not only in acute but also in chronic childhood diarrhea, and may play an important role in the interaction between diarrhea and malnutrition.\r"

The patients with CF did not differ from the other groups in terms of age at time of onset of prolapse, growth measurements, or number of episodes of prolapse. All patients with CF had a history of abnormalities or presented with signs and symptoms consistent with this diagnosis; none had a history of constipation. Although physicians can be reassured that CF is not a likely diagnosis in patients with RP and acute diarrheal disease or a clear history of constipation, a sweat test is indicated in all such cases as well as in those in which there is no apparent underlying cause. A sweat test is not usually indicated in patients with RP in association with underlying anatomic abnormalities.\r"

A balanced electrolyte solution of the nonabsorbable polymer polyethylene glycol (GoLytely, Braintree [Mass] Laboratories Inc) offers a safe and efficient method for clearing the intestine. Twenty-four patients with a mean age of 8.1 years (range, 0.8 to 17.6 years) and an average weight of 31.5 kg received polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution: eight patients with encopresis were given it as treatment for severe fecal retention unresponsive to outpatient management; the other 16 were being prepared for colonoscopy. Weight, complete blood cell count, and serum electrolyte, serum urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine levels were measured before solution administration and two hours afterward. Abdominal roentgenograms were obtained from the encopretic patients. The two groups were comparable in age and weight. Polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution was given at a rate of 14 to 40 mL/kg/h until clear fluid was excreted through the rectum. Intestines were cleaned out successfully in all patients, and side effects were minimal. Children with encopresis required an average of 11.8 L (574 mL/kg) given over 22.5 hours, while the other children needed only 4.0 L (128 mL/kg) given over 7.5 hours. Weight and serum electrolyte and creatinine levels did not change significantly in any patient. The hematocrit decreased only in encopretic patients (0.38 to 0.36 [37.6% to 35.8%]) and the serum urea nitrogen level decreased in the patients undergoing colonoscopy (3.6 to 2.0 mmol/L [10 to 8 mg/dL]).\r"

Propranolol caused a significant increase in the time required to perform sensitive psychometric tests (p less than 0.05).

Serum AST concentration and indices of cellular immune function were similar in patients with varying HBV replicative activity (high and low HBV DNA concentrations). The observed lack of relationship between serum AST concentration and indices of cellular immune function and HBV replication suggests either that other factors determine the severity of hepatic inflammation in chronic HBV infection, or that currently available tests of cellular immune function and HBV replicative activity do not accurately reflect processes in the liver.\r"

In order to assess the potential usefulness of screening by colonoscopy in this high-risk population, we reviewed the records of 48 colonoscopies performed on asymptomatic patients who were self- or physician-referred for colonoscopy because of a history of one or more first-degree relatives with colon cancer. Twelve (25%) had at least one adenomatous polyp, but no significant atypia was detected. No cancers were detected. One third of the lesions were beyond the reach of a flexible sigmoidoscope. This apparent increase in the prevalence of adenomas was most striking (46%) among men over the age of 50. These preliminary results demonstrate that colonoscopy is effective in detecting and removing adenomatous polyps in a substantial fraction of asymptomatic patients whose sole risk-factor is being a first-degree relative of a patient with colon cancer. Further studies in larger populations are warranted to determine the use of colonoscopy in screening these high-risk individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Antral gastritis has been described in up to 100% of patients with duodenal ulcer disease, and recently has been associated with Campylobacter pylori infection. The present study examines the effect of two ulcer therapies (cimetidine and colloidal bismuth subcitrate) on this lesion. Sixty-four consecutive patients with endoscopically diagnosed duodenal ulcer were randomized to treatment with either agent upon entry into the study. Antral biopsies were taken at both initial and final endoscopies for culture of C. pylori and assessment of degree of gastritis (as based on inflammatory cell infiltrate: grades 0 to 3). The organism was detected in 90% of the patients at initial biopsy, and grades 2 and 3 gastritis were documented in 76%. The presence of the organism and the gastritis were significantly correlated (p less than 0.001), and the bacterium was not cultured from histologically normal antral mucosa. Active chronic gastritis (grade 3) was seen in 65% of those with C. pylori, and was not found in any patient without the bacterium. Cimetidine had no effect on either the organism or the gastritis, whereas the bismuth preparation significantly (p less than 0.002) reduced the prevalence of both. The present study documents that therapy directed against C. pylori has a significant effect on the gastritis of duodenal ulcer disease and possible mechanisms for the observed effects are discussed.\r"

The distal esophagus of five subjects with daily heartburn was monitored for 24 h in the laboratory via an antimony pH electrode. The computer output from the ambulatory unit was compared to the on-line recording in terms of all events in which the pH dropped below four. A signal detection model was used, with an on-line pH tracing serving as the criterion response. The events noted as true positives (80%) were an accurate representation by the computer output of the events of pH less than four displayed by the on-line recording. The processing done by this particular ambulatory system tends to actually \"ignore\" transient pH drops (18% false negatives) and, may, in fact, provide more physiologically meaningful information than hardwired analog techniques for 24-h pH monitoring. The results confirm that ambulatory pH monitoring can produce meaningful and reliable physiological data concerning gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

Patients were studied retrospectively and followed for up to 10 years (mean 52 +/- 5 months). Only 20% (n = 10) of patients converted to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative, the majority of whom did so within 6 months of becoming HBsAg positive. Twenty-nine percent (n = 14) of patients developed chronic elevation of liver enzymes which remitted in one patient. Only one patient died from liver disease. We conclude that HBV infection in hemodialysis patients more often results in persistent antigenemia and chronic elevation of liver enzymes than is the case in patients without kidney disease. However, the risk of death from liver disease is low.\r"

These findings were caused by reduced urea nitrogen losses in the peritonitis group, which proportionately, more than made up for the increased nitrogen losses from protein. We speculate that the smaller loss of urea nitrogen was due to diminished intake of food. Cephalothin uptake from the peritoneal cavity was unaltered by peritonitis and a dialysate flow rate of 2 L/hour averaged 26 +/- 2 mL/minute and 27 +/- 2 mL/minute in the noninfected and infected groups, respectively.\r"

Acute metabolic acidosis produced by HCI infusion resulted in a prompt rise in the plasma [K], whereas no change was observed during acute respiratory acidosis in the dog. After 3 to 5 days of acidosis due to NH4Cl feeding, dogs became hypokalemic; this fall in the plasma [K] was due largely to increased urine K excretion. Despite hypokalemia, aldosterone levels were not low, and the calculated transtubular [K] gradient was relatively high, suggesting renal aldosterone action. Thus, rather than anticipating hyperkalemia in patients with chronic metabolic acidosis due to a HCl load, the finding of hyperkalemia should suggest that the rate of urinary K excretion is lower than expected (ie, there are low aldosterone levels or failure of the kidney to respond to this hormone).\r"

In six, but in none of five control patients on short-term hemodialysis, increased tracer uptake was found at the site of one or several articular and/or periarticular regions. Increased uptake at a given joint was often, but not always, associated with joint pain. It appeared to precede radiologically visible changes. In conclusion, the 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate scan may be of help in the early diagnosis of dialysis amyloidosis.\r"

  ".W": "Recent advances in technology have not substantially changed the relatively low survival rate associated with acute renal failure (ARF). Several clinical prognostic variables and multivariate models have been reported to predict survival in individual patients, but these are either cumbersome to use or restrictive in their application. A straightforward clinical index has been developed to predict survival in ARF based on data obtained for all patients receiving dialysis for ARF at the University of Kansas Medical Center from November 1979 through October 1985. During this period, 126 patients received dialysis for ARF, with an overall survival of 25% (32/126). There were no significant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors in age, gender, or indication for dialysis. Eleven variables were statistically related to survival, and were reduced to five when clinically similar variables were combined or eliminated. A clinical survival index was based on these five easily determined variables that were significantly related to survival: systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 110 mm Hg, assisted ventilation, congestive heart failure, proven or suspected sepsis, and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction (bleeding, ileus, obstruction, or recent abdominal surgery). Survival was directly related to the number of factors present: zero, 62% (8/13); one, 44% (8/18); two, 30% (10/33); three, 19% (5/26); four, 0% (0/20); and five, 6% (1/16). This straightforward index, derived from easily obtained clinical data, is useful for judging survival prognosis in patients with ARF severe enough to warrant treatment with dialysis.\r"

Intramuscular injections of CCK-8 and of cerulein induced mean maximal ejection fractions (EF max) of 50% +/- 6% and 58% +/- 4%, respectively. The mean EF max after ingestion of a fatty meal was 44% +/- 3%, while the EF max after a fat-restricted meal was significantly lower (17% +/- 4%). Oral water and sham feeding also significantly induced gallbladder contractions (EF max; 25% +/- 4% and 12% +/- 4% respectively) that were eliminated by premedication with atropine. The plasma CCK rose significantly after exogenous administration of CCK-8 and after ingestion of a fatty meal. The peak CCK concentration released after fatty meals was almost identical to that after exogenous CCK-8 loading. In contrast, plasma CCK levels showed no change after the fat-restricted meal, oral water and sham feeding. These findings suggest that not only CCK but also the cholinergic pathway may play important roles in the control mechanism of human gallbladder contraction.\r"

Patients in both groups had a high prevalence of abnormal liver function tests. It is concluded that infectious mononucleosis in patients over 40 years of age is not as uncommon as previously reported, and that clinical and laboratory features differ between young and older patients suffering from this disease.\r"

Histologic investigation of the skin lesion and nasal mucosa revealed non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse, mixed type. Her chief complaints were progressive dyspnea and hoarseness. Leukemic cell masses in her upper respiratory tract caused narrowing of the airway, which was responsible for her complaints.\r"

Results: partial remission, 3/16 (19%); stable disease, 8/16 (50%); and progressive disease, 5/16 (31%). Improvement in ECOG performance status was observed in 2/3 responding and 6/8 stable disease patients, respectively. Toxicities included hand-foot syndrome, mucositis, diarrhea, and cerebellar ataxia, which required treatment interruption in 9/16 patients (56%). No myelosuppression or catheter related problems were seen.

Sero-groups of beta-hemolytic streptococci were compared with respect to the patient's underlying disease, age, and clinical outcome. Patients who had GBS isolated from sputum were elderly (mean age, 68.1 years) and were older than patients with other beta-hemolytic isolates (mean age, 56 years). Patients with Group B streptococci were more likely to have cerebrovascular disease, whereas patients with Group C, G, and F were more likely to have malignancy, particularly of the head and neck.\r"

Implantation of anterior chamber lenses with the posterior capsule left intact (18 eyes) caused a similar degree of cell loss (23.5%) but caused marked polymegethism and pleomorphism of the cells. Endothelial cell loss (28.5%) and morphologic changes were greatest in five eyes that received anterior chamber lenses because of a rupture of the posterior capsule.\r"

We reduced the enlarged blind spot in a patient with focal peripapillary hyperopia, without papilledema, to near normal size by using progressively stronger plus lenses. Similarly, with the addition of plus sphere, we reduced the size of the blind spot in five of six patients with papilledema, but in none of our normal subjects.\r"

The degree of impairment was directly related to serum anticholinergic activity levels and, in the small subgroup of patients scheduled for spinal anesthesia, to CSF anticholinergic activity. Two of the mental status tests used, the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test and the Saskatoon Delirium Checklist, were sensitive enough to detect these mild drug-induced changes, while two other tests, the Mini-Mental State and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, were not.\r"

All patients were evaluated by means of a sleep/wake log, a sleep habits questionnaire, structured psychiatric and clinical interviews, and a minimum of two consecutive nights of polysomnography. Notwithstanding a high rate of Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC)-diagnosed psychopathology (63%) in this sample, the major finding was that in 49% of the patients laboratory results added to, refuted, and/or failed to support the clinical impression. This resulted in substantial modification of the initial diagnostic formulation and therefore in increased specificity of diagnosis.\r"

The best described neuropsychiatric alterations are dementia and an organic psychosis. Organic mood disorder has been reported less often, and mania secondary to idiopathic basal ganglia calcification has not been noted previously. The authors describe five patients with idiopathic basal ganglia calcification and organic mood changes, including one patient with secondary mania. Symptoms of idiopathic basal ganglia calcification resemble those of other disorders affecting subcortical structures and support an association between mood, affect, cognition, and the extrapyramidal nuclear system. Treatment may ameliorate the mood disorder.\r"

We conclude that shoulder arthroscopy accurately delineates abnormalities of the anterior and posterior labrum, bicipital labral complex, rotator cuff, joint synovium, and humeral head. CT arthrography accurately delineates capsular redundancy, loose bodies, hardware around joints, and bony glenoid rim abnormalities.\r"

Results from a group of 31 patients undergoing this procedure were compared with a group of 8 patients managed conservatively while awaiting surgery. The mean injury to follow-up interval was 82 months in the operated group and 104 months in the nonoperated group. The mean surgery to follow-up interval was 53 months. Sixty-nine percent of surgical patients were subjectively improved; however, 29 (91%) continued to have pain and 19 (59%) continued to experience giving way. Thirteen patients from the operated group who had associated procedures performed were significantly better subjectively than those with no associated procedures (P less than 0.05). Physical examination demonstrated no difference in clinical laxity between the operated and nonoperated groups. Medial gastrocnemius transfer did not result in any significant reduction in anterior-posterior translation (KT-1000 assessment) when reconstructed knees were compared with control posterior cruciate deficient knees. Surgery, combined with subsequent immobilization, may have also been responsible for the significant reduction in lower limb function observed in the reconstructed patients. We do not recommend this procedure as a primary PCL reconstruction.\r"

Current applications demonstrate excellent visualization of the anatomy and pathology of various organs. Preliminary studies in the knee reveal fine resolution of anatomy and pathology involving the meniscus. The purpose of this study is to determine a prospective correlation between MRI scans and actual meniscal pathology as documented at the time of arthroscopy. MRI scans were obtained in 155 patients, on 156 knees (one patient with bilateral scans), with 86 patients (87 knees) eventually undergoing diagnostic and operative videoarthroscopy performed by the same surgeon (DWJ). All images were obtained on the same high-resolution 1.5 Tesla GE Signa Magnetic Resonance Scanner with the same radiologist performing all readings (PEB). The knees were studied in the coronal and sagittal plane using a spin echo sequence and 5 mm slice thicknesses. The menisci were described as having Grade 1, 2, or 3 changes, with Grade 3 reserved for complete tears. Using arthroscopy as the diagnostic standard, the accuracy of MRI in diagnosing medial and lateral meniscal tears was 93.1% and 96.6%, respectively with a Grade 3 MRI reading. For tears of the ACL, the accuracy was 96.6% as confirmed at arthroscopy. Five tears of the PCL were also documented by MRI and correlated with clinical evaluation. Other abnormalities seen were articular cartilage and osteochondral defects, bone tumors, tibial plateau fractures, Baker's cysts, and meniscal cysts. The MRI scan is a highly accurate, noninvasive modality for documentation of meniscal pathology as well as cruciate ligament tears in the knee.\r"

Most of these (22, 91.6%) were contact injuries, and in the 11 cases where the mechanism of injury was known (45.8%), were incurred by a blow to the outer aspect of the leg while the foot was planted. The ACL was normal in 6 of the 24 knees. The abduction stress test at 0 degree extension was severely positive (2+ or more) in 21 of the 24 knees (87.5%). The phenomenon of an absent or equivocal posterior drawer test in the situation of acute straight medial instability is felt to occur when the mechanism of injury does not stress, strain, or tear the arcuate complex. If the PCL tear is not discovered and repaired, repeated stressful activity stretches the arcuate complex, and the chronically unstable knee subsequently presents with a positive posterior drawer test.\r"

Six acromioplasties were performed according to the recommended technique of Dr. Neer to create a standard for comparison. Fourteen fresh postmortem specimens were studied. In seven shoulders a standard acromioplasty was performed with an osteotome. In seven shoulders an acromioplasty was performed using standard arthroscopic approaches and motorized instruments. In five shoulders an isolated division of the coracoacromial ligament was performed arthroscopically. The coracoacromial ligament was completely divided in all five cases. In the osteotome group adequate bone was resected in 75% (21/28) measured locations. In the arthroscopic group adequate bone was removed at 86% (24/28) location. This difference is not statistically significant. In the cadaver, anterior acromioplasty was performed effectively and predictably with arthroscopic instruments. This compared favorably to a conventional osteotome acromioplasty. It was concluded that coracoacromial ligament division can be accomplished.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to examine risk patterns of concussion in college football. Multivariate models were used to interpret the data. Specifically, log-linear modeling and analysis techniques were incorporated into the investigation. An average of 49 college teams were studied over the 8 year period 1975 to 1982. This represented over 36,000 athlete-seasons and 395 team-seasons. The data selected were limited to 1,005 game-related concussions. The general hypotheses tested were the null hypothesis that the variables of team (offense and defense), player position, situation (rushing and passing), and activity (block and tackle) had no effect on the occurrence of these game-related concussions. It was found that concussions were a persistent and regular but relatively infrequent type of injury in college football. Concussions accounted for 75% of the total number of injuries on or about the head. The injuries were examined relative to player position, situation, and activity using a log-linear modeling technique, with interactions among the variables also established. The contribution of each variable was not always equal or completely interactive. Generally, the highest risk of concussion was associated with offensive and defensive players involved in a block on a rushing play. Specifically, running backs demonstrated the highest risk of concussion, regardless of activity. The lowest risk was for offensive linemen and quarterbacks while blocking on any type of play. On defense, the secondary exhibited the highest risk of concussion while being blocked on a running play. Similarly, linemen experienced their greatest risk while being blocked on plays run inside the tackle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Knowledge of the normal anatomical variations of this nerve is thus of importance to the surgeon, so that he can avoid postoperative distress caused by unintentional injury to the infrapatellar nerve. Anatomical variations of this nerve have been studied in 20 cadavers, with particular reference to its relationship to the sartorius and the nerve's distance from the medial femoral epicondyle. In 52.9% of the cadavers studied, the anatomy of the infrapatellar nerve was identical on both sides. Four types of nerve were found and classified according to their relationship to the sartorius: posterior, penetrating, parallel, and anterior. The commonest type was the posterior (62.2%), where the nerve emerged at the posterior border of the sartorius before passing superficial to it to supply the skin and fascia over the front and medial aspect of the knee and the proximal part of the leg. Situated furthest from the medial femoral epicondyle was the parallel type (average, 105.7 mm), which runs parallel to the posterior border of the sartorius before crossing it at infrapatellar level.\r"

  ".W": "Six athletes, all engaged in running activities at the time of injury, presented with tenderness over the medial malleolus and ankle effusion. Three patients had a fracture line which could be seen on radiographs. These patients were treated by open reduction and internal fixation using two 4.0 cancellous screws. The other three patients had normal radiographs but bone scans showed increased uptake over the medial malleolus. These patients were treated with cast and immobilization. We believe that each of these patients suffered a stress fracture of the medial malleolus. We suggest that the possibility of a stress fracture be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with 1) chronic or subacute pain over the medial malleolus and ankle effusion, and 2) a history of running activity at the time of injury or running activities aggravating the pain. Bone scans appear to be more sensitive than radiographs in detecting a stress fracture of the medial malleolus. We propose that athletes with radiographic signs of a medial malleolar fracture who desire early return to full participation should be treated by open reduction and internal fixation. For these patients, early motion can be initiated. Other athletes whose fracture cannot be detected on radiographs but whose malleolus shows increased uptake in the area on bone scans can be treated nonsurgically with immobilization and then progressive increase in activity. All of our patients returned to full activity between 6 and 8 weeks after treatment was initiated.\r"

Subjects pretested and posttested both concentrically and eccentrically, so that training overflow and specificity could be examined. Three maximally hit tennis serves made before and after training, which were analyzed by high speed cinematography to obtain ball velocity, served as a functional performance measurement. Statistical analysis of peak torque (newton meters) and peak torque to body weight ratio have revealed significant concentric strength gains (P less than 0.005) in the concentric as well as the eccentric training groups. Eccentric strength gains were demonstrated by the concentric training group at selected speeds (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.005) but were not generated in the eccentric group at the P less than 0.05 significance level. Functional test analysis shows an increase in maximal serve velocity at a significance level of P less than 0.005 in the concentric training group, with no significant (P greater than 0.01) increases in the eccentric group.\r"

The muscles used in this study fall into four morphologic categories: fusiform, unipennate, bipennate, and multipennate. Each muscle was pulled to failure at three different rates of strain (1, 10, and 100 cm/min). Specimens of fusiform, unipennate, and bipennate muscles were pulled from their proximal as well as distal attachments. The relationship of elongation to failure of the entire musculotendinous unit to resting muscle fiber length was examined to determine the effect of angle of pennation and fiber length on the failure properties. Our results demonstrate that all four muscle types tested show injury and rupture at the musculotendinous junction whether pulled from proximal or distal attachment, regardless of muscle structure and rate of strain. There was a statistically significant difference (P less than 0.005) in the degree of elongation to failure relative to resting muscle fiber length, with a tendency to greater elongation relative to fiber length for muscles with more pennate structure (tibialis anterior, 72.7% +/- 1.0%; extensor digitorum longus, 113.1% +/- 3.5%; rectus femoris, 225.5% +/- 3.7% elongation in percent resting fiber length).\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive and relatively safe procedure that is capable of distinguishing and differentiating small soft-tissue structures. Ten patients with primary hyperparathyroidism underwent preoperative diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging followed by cervical exploration. In 9 of these patients (90 percent), imaging correctly predicted the location of a single enlarged parathyroid gland, and in one patient the findings were misleading. All 10 patients proved to have single adenomas in orthotopic locations. Based on this early experience, magnetic resonance imaging appears to be a promising technique for preoperative localization of an enlarged parathyroid gland.\r"

Eight patients had persistent symptoms of acute cholecystitis despite intense symptoms of acute cholecystitis despite intense medical management. Of these patients, five underwent cholecystostomy and survived. The other three patients had cholecystectomy and one died. Thirteen patients presented with jaundice. Twelve patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography which revealed gallbladder stones in four but no stones in the common bile duct. They did not undergo further surgical procedures. One patient presented with jaundice, cholangitis, and pancreatitis was found to have stones in the common bile duct and underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy with removal of multiple small, pigmented stones. This patient died from sepsis and renal failure 37 days after sphincterotomy. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was unsuccessful in four patients who later underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography which revealed stones in one and cirrhotic ductal changes in three. The remaining jaundiced patient underwent cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration which revealed no ductal stones. This patient died 21 days after operation from sepsis and multiple organ system failure. Three of five patients with gallstones on endoscopic retrograde cholangiography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography died, but none of the deaths were due to biliary tract disease. At last follow-up the two surviving patients were asymptomatic. The overall mortality rate was 14 percent (3 of 21 patients). Cholecystostomy in cirrhotic patients with advanced liver disease and acute cholecystitis is associated with minimal mortality and morbidity. Cirrhotic patients with jaundice are probably best evaluated initially by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which is safe, diagnostic, and sometimes therapeutic.\r"

In the present series, recurrent disease was evident after hepatic resection, most commonly in the lungs; the liver; and locally, in that order. About half of the 45 patients with a second recurrence were operated on, and the recurrence was completely removed in roughly half of these patients. A median survival estimate of 31 months (range 1 to 67 months) after complete removal of the second recurrence was better than the survival estimate of 14 months (range 1 to 18 months) for those in whom the recurrence could not be removed (p less than 0.01). An elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level as the only indicator of recurrence after hepatic resection has proved to be an ominous prognostic sign.\r"

The remaining 128 masses with negative findings were observed and follow-up of 101 patients obtained. Cancer did not develop in any of these patients. Careful physical examination and mammography can predict if a breast mass is malignant or benign in 85 to 90 percent of patients. If fine-needle aspiration biopsy is added and performed by physicians and cytopathologists experienced in the technique, additional information is obtained which allows greater diagnostic accuracy and may eliminate many breast biopsies.\r"

These results may be attributed to the following: good personal contact between the surgeon and the patient at the first meeting, 1 month of preoperative management with carbimazole and propranolol without interruption of work, operation adapted to the type of goiter, and treatment of postoperative tachycardia by propranolol. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5 days. Sequelae were rare. In the patients with Graves' disease, results at 2 years were as follows: 74 percent of operated patients were euthyroid, 23 percent required substitutive treatment, and surgical treatment failed or early relapse occurred in 3 percent. There were no recurrences after operation in patients with solitary or multinodular toxic goiter, but 30 percent of the former and 98 percent of the latter had to be treated with L-thyroxine.

The combined use of the two methods resulted in only a 23.2 percent sensitivity for thigh thrombi and an overall sensitivity of 47.4 percent.

Based on this finding, we suggest that preoperative arteriograms be obtained. The method of treating these patients after arteriography should be to move quickly to the operating room. Patients with renal artery occlusion must be seriously considered for primary revascularization with either aortofemoral or aortoiliac reconstruction and thrombectomy or bypass of the occluded renal artery. If no renal artery involvement is revealed on arteriography, the initial operation should include an attempt to reestablish inflow by retrograde femoral thromboembolectomy under local anesthesia. If that fails, a decision must be made based on the patient's clinical status, whether a major vascular procedure would be tolerated. If so, primary revascularization or transabdominal thrombectomy should be attempted. If the patient is deemed unable to tolerate a major vascular procedure, then axillobifemoral bypass under local anesthesia should be performed. Postoperatively, the patient should be aggressively managed to prevent pulmonary and renal complications. Even with aggressive surgical management and postoperative care, these patients have an uncertain postoperative course. It is of primary importance that physicians realize that time is a critical factor and these patients must be referred to the appropriate care center promptly. Only by ensuring prompt surgical management can a mortality rate of less than 50 percent be expected.\r"

The older a patient is at the time of cholecystectomy, the more likely it is for that patient to present with an acute biliary complication. The elderly tolerate biliary tract operations quite well, especially before acute complications of cholelithiasis occur. Early cholecystectomy can prevent the morbidity associated with the natural progression of cholelithiasis. Whether prophylactic cholecystectomy for asymptomatic cholelithiasis would be cost effective is an issue that can be resolved only when further data regarding the natural history and incidence of cholelithiasis in the elderly is known.\r"

Due to the often extensive loss of duodenal substance, plication is impossible, pyloroplasty is hazardous, and duodenal closure is tenuous at best. In the absence of surgical precedent, it was thought that an ideal procedure would embody three principles: (1) defunctionalization of the upper gastrointestinal tract; (2) minimization of suture lines; and (3) control of potential fistula sites with tube enterostomies. As it finally evolved, the procedure of gastric disconnection became truncal vagectomy and antrectomy, along with tube gastrostomy, duodenostomy, and jejunostomy. Restoration of gastrointestinal continuity was deferred for 3 to 4 weeks after recovery. Four consecutive patients have been successfully managed by this technique. Gastric disconnection is physiologically sound and may prove to be superior to alternative techniques in this difficult condition.\r"

Iatrogenic injuries had a 50 percent mortality rate in all gestational age and birth weight categories and, therefore, great caution and surveillance are of utmost importance when using invasive monitoring and therapeutic modalities to prevent this cause of perforation. Term infants had a preponderance of mechanical causes of perforation which mainly occurred in the foregut and proximal midgut, whereas premature infants have a preponderance of asphyxial or ischemic events underlying perforations which mainly occurred in the ileocolic region and were often associated with necrotizing enterocolitis. Although neonatal intestinal perforation is a catastrophic event, the very premature infant weighing less than 1,000 g at birth is at significantly greatest risk. The discouraging 20 percent survival rate in the less than 1,000 g premature infants presents a challenge to the surgeon, since the overall survival rate was 59 percent and the term infants had a 78 percent survival rate. A substantial share of the mortality in the infants weighing less than 1,000 g at birth relates to the occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Vigorous medical and surgical approaches can be used to salvage premature infants in all weight classes with gastrointestinal perforation.\r"

One hundred seventeen consecutive patients were studied because their serum amylase levels were abnormally high for periods ranging from 3 to 48 weeks. In each case, extensive clinical and radiologic evaluation had failed to reveal a reason for the abnormality. The amylase isoenzymes of their sera were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the fractions were measured by a saccharogenic assay. The findings in the 117 patients showed that 79 percent had non-pancreatic causes for their hyperamylasemia. The biggest single group (64 percent) had a normal distribution of isoamylases, albeit at unusually high concentrations. This phenomenon, which has not been defined previously, is probably a variant of normal in which the homeostatic balance between production and metabolism is set at a high level. Macroamylasemia accounted for 6 percent of the cases and salivary hyperamylasemia for only 9 percent. Three patients had the characteristic isoamylase pattern (\"old amylase\") associated with pancreatic pseudocysts. Isoamylase fractionation is a cheap, efficient, and effective means of ruling out a pancreatic cause for hyperamylasemia. It is probable that in the majority of cases of persistent hyperamylasemia without obvious clinical cause there will be no disease at all.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred two patients admitted with the clinical suspicion of acute pancreatitis underwent computerized tomography scanning within 36 hours of admission. The diagnostic value of the computerized tomography findings was excellent, with a sensitivity of 92 percent and a specificity of 100 percent. One hundred seventy-six patients with acute pancreatitis defined according to the overall clinical course were included in the prognostic study. The pancreatitis was fatal in 21 patients, severe in 47 patients, and mild in 108 patients. The computerized tomography findings were classified into the following three groups on the basis of the extent of phlegmonous extrapancreatic spread: Group I, no phlegmonous extrapancreatic spread (100 patients, none died); Group II, phlegmonous extrapancreatic spread in one or two areas (28 patients, mortality rate 4 percent); and Group III, phlegmonous extrapancreatic spread in three or more areas (48 patients, mortality rate 42 percent) (p less than 0.0001). The following three scores from prognostic clinical and laboratory data were also obtained: Score 1, zero or one positive sign (82 patients, none died); Score 2, two to four positive signs (54 patients, mortality rate 13 percent); Score 3, five or more positive signs (40 patients, mortality rate 35 percent) (p less than 0.001). The combination of computerized tomography findings and prognostic signs had the best predictive value. Patients in Group III, Score 3 (24 patients) or Group III, Score 2 (19 patients) had mortality rates of 58 percent and 32 percent, respectively, and complications developed in all of the survivors. In addition, all except two acute pancreatitis patients in whom pancreatic abscess developed were found in Group III (p less than 0.0001). Furthermore, for Group III patients, the prediction of death associated with abscesses was enhanced by the number of prognostic signs. The mortality rate increased from 17 percent for Score 2 patients to 81 percent for Score 3 patients (p = 0.0078). As a result of this study, we recommend early computerized tomography for all Score 2 and Score 3 patients, since it allows prompt recognition of patients at high risk for systemic and local complications. Adequate therapy can then be directed to the group of patients to whom it is best suited. Serial computerized tomographies should be reserved for those patients presenting with phlegmonous extrapancreatic spread.\r"

Nodal involvement in the marginal sinus (30 nodes) and partial medullary sinus (37 nodes) were commonly seen, and the lymph nodes of those types were enlarged compared with 1,086 patients with no metastatic lymph nodes (control group). Lymph nodes of the wide medullary sinus (11 nodes), small nodule (3 nodes), and massive involvement types (17 nodes) did not enlarge compared with those of the other types and those of the control group. Most of the metastatic sites (76.6 percent) were in the perigastric lymph nodes along the lesser and greater curvatures, about a fifth were in the extraperigastric nodes along the left gastric, common hepatic, celiac, and splenic arteries, and the least were in the extraperigastric nodes (3.1 percent) along the hepatoduodenal ligament. Since the rate of macroscopic diagnosis during operation was so poor, regardless of the histologic modes of nodal involvement, and also in cases of metastatic lymph nodes less than 15 mm in widest diameter, for curative operation of patients with early gastric cancer, perigastric and extraperigastric lymph nodes along the main arteries near the stomach should be completely dissected, in addition to resection of the stomach.\r"

Excision of the tumor was carried out in 57 patients (63 percent) and was curative in 28 cases and palliative in 29 cases. Curative resection included proximal gastrectomy in 5 patients and total gastrectomy in 23 patients, which was extended to the spleen and distal pancreas in 18 patients. Lymph node metastases were found in 67 percent of the patients treated by resection. According to the TNM classification, 18 percent of the patients undergoing resection had stage I tumor, 28 percent had stage II tumor, 40 percent had stage III tumor, and 14 percent had stage IV tumor. The postoperative mortality rate was 16 percent for the entire series, 21 percent for patients undergoing palliative resection, and only 4 percent for patients undergoing curative resection. Three patients had an obvious anastomotic leak, one of whom died. Median survival time was 5 months for patients who had exploration only, 6 months for patients who had palliative resection, and 36 months for patients who had potentially curative resection. The 5 year actuarial survival rate was 20 percent for patients having resection and 40 percent for patients having curative resection. Survival was closely related to tumor stage. These results indicate that total gastrectomy with complete abdominal lymph node dissection can give comparatively good long-term results when performed for cure. Nevertheless, only one of three patients in this series could have a potentially curative resection. The only way to increase the curative resection rate and to improve survival is to detect the cancer at an early stage.\r"

The operations were for cure in all cases. Twenty-five patients were alive after 5 years, for a crude 5 year survival rate of 42 percent. The operative mortality rate was 5 percent (three patients). Twenty-four patients (41 percent) had complications, which consisted of postoperative respiratory infection in 11 patients (19 percent), postoperative ileus in 4 patients (7 percent), and subphrenic abscess in 2 patients (3.4 percent). In addition, there was one wound dehiscence and one liver rupture (with fatal outcome), one deep venous thrombosis, one urinary infection, and one wound infection. Only one patient (1.7 percent) had an anastomotic leak at the gastrojejunostomy site. Seven relaparotomies (12 percent) had to be performed for complications. We have concluded that, in patients with distal gastric cancer, 95 percent subtotal gastrectomy can result in a 5 year survival rate that is comparable to that reported in the literature for total gastrectomy, and it has the advantage of a very low rate of anastomotic leakage between the minute gastric remnant and the jejunum. Therefore, 95 percent subtotal gastrectomy is recommended over total gastrectomy in the treatment of distal gastric cancer.\r"

Patients with vomiting of food but not bile, postprandial pain, and nausea were considered to have the Roux-Y stasis syndrome. The syndrome was found in 49 patients with gastrojejunostomy (30 percent of those at risk) but in only 2 patients with esophagojejunostomy (8 percent, p less than 0.05). The condition was more common in women than men (p less than 0.05), but it was equally common in patients with and without vagotomy. The mean length of the Roux-Y limb in patients with stasis was 41 cm, which was longer than the 36 cm in patients without stasis (p less than 0.001). When multiple logistic regression was used, the length of the Roux-Y limb emerged as the major risk factor (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, construction of Roux-Y limbs greater than about 40 cm in length may increase the incidence of the Roux-Y stasis syndrome.\r"

One hundred four patients had either Gastrografin swallow or the methylene blue test to evaluate anastomotic integrity before resumption of oral feeding. Both tests were disappointing in that methylene blue failed to detect any case of leakage and Gastrografin swallow could only detect three cases of subclinical leakage. The high false-negative detection rate of Gastrografin swallow might be related to the inferior radiographic detail provided by this contrast medium. Aspiration of Gastrografin is potentially dangerous and could be fatal. We believe that barium sulfate, which provides better radiographic detail and is not so hazardous when aspirated, should be the contrast medium of choice.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty asymptomatic volunteer subjects underwent prolonged computerized ambulatory distal esophageal pH monitoring to characterize acid reflux patterns. A bimodal distribution of data, which corresponded to the erect and supine positions, occurred in 45 subjects, and separate mean baseline pH values were noted for the erect and supine positions (pH 6.46 and pH 5.46, respectively, p less than 0.001). At esophageal pH 4, reflux episodes occurred more commonly in the erect position (44 percent) than in the supine position (20 percent). There were also significantly greater numbers of reflux events and longer durations when the pH was below 3 (p less than 0.02) and 4 (p less than 0.001) in the erect compared with the supine position, but prolonged events (more than 10 minutes) occurred in both positions. Postprandial reflux occurred in 78.7 percent of the subjects, with an average of 5.1 episodes. A slight but significant correlation between age and erect reflux was seen (p less than 0.04). In the pH 3 to 5 range, 18 percent of the subjects had acid exposure in excess of the group mean plus 2 standard deviations and 10 percent in excess of the mean plus 3 standard deviations. Overall, a nonnormal distribution of pH data was found with 28 subjects having less than 1.6 percent of their values below pH 4. This finding may represent either the true spectrum of normal acid reflux or a subclinical pathologic state that will become symptomatic over time.\r"

The caudad end of the channel is restricted by a 5 cm collar. Thirty-one obese patients more than 45 kg overweight were studied by interview, barium swallow, endoscopy, and manometry. These procedures were repeated 13 +/- 5.5 weeks postoperatively, after resolution of operative edema and before extensive weight loss. Preoperative symptoms included heartburn in 24 patients, regurgitation in 17 patients, and aspiration in 2 patients, and barium swallow demonstrated hiatal hernia in 7 patients and reflux in 7 patients (5 with hiatal hernia). In addition, endoscopy detected mild esophagitis in 3 patients, and hiatal hernia in 11 patients. Postoperatively, the incidence of heartburn decreased in all patients, barium swallow showed slow channel emptying but no hiatal hernia or reflux, and endoscopy did not identify any esophagitis. Preoperative lower esophageal sphincter pressure was 14.5 +/- 7.2 mm Hg. Postoperatively, the vertical banded gastroplasty channel had an initial peak (collar) pressure of 19.2 +/- 7.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01 compared with preoperative lower esophageal sphincter pressure), a channel pressure of 9.5 +/- 6 mm Hg, a lower esophageal sphincter pressure of 20.1 +/- 7.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.005), and a channel length of 6.8 +/- 1.4 cm. Vertical banded gastroplasty creates a high pressure channel, inhibiting reflux of gastric juice without the need for any additional procedure.\r"

Thirteen died from radiation-induced complications and 27, from recurrent malignancy. Radiation deaths occurred in the postoperative period but had no impact on long-term survival. Life expectancy was poorer in patients presenting with perforation or fistula compared with bleeding or stricture, the main reason being significantly more recurrences among patients with fistulas (p less than 0.05).\r"

Hemostasis was evaluated by intraoperative measurement of blood loss and bleeding time at the staple line. There was no statistically significant difference in mean blood loss (p greater than 0.05) or mean bleeding time (p greater than 0.10) between the two cartridges. Wound healing was studied using bursting strength measurements and silicone rubber casting of the microvasculature at the staple line. At 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks postoperatively, there was no significant difference between bursting strength values achieved with the two cartridges. Microscopic examination revealed that wound healing in the ILA-52 anastomoses lagged behind healing in the ILA-32 anastomoses at each postoperative time period studied. The silicone rubber casting study showed a paucity of microvasculature at the healing staple line with the ILA-52 cartridge as compared with the ILA-32 cartridge. Our findings suggest that the ILA-52 cartridge does not offer significantly improved intraoperative hemostasis over the ILA-32 cartridge and may affect the microvasculature at the staple line in a way that delays wound healing.\r"

The addition of adrenaline to bupivacaine prolongs analgesia, reduces the degree of hypotension and delays its onset. Plasma bupivacaine levels were consistently lower when adrenaline was added, but this difference was significant only at 10 minutes after the initial dose. Prolonging the interval between increments seems to be a more reliable way to reduce plasma concentration than the addition of the catecholamine.\r"

In one case, blockage of the tracheal tube was detected swiftly and allowed corrective steps to be taken. This method can be used in patients with bronchospasm to detect correct tracheal placement when auscultation and decreased compliance of the chest may make clinical confirmation difficult. It can be concluded from this study that the oesophageal detector device is a reliable, rapid, inexpensive and easy to use method for the detection of oesophageal intubation and its very low cost should make it readily available in all situations where tracheal intubation is carried out.\r"

Each device was tested in two ways. First, the pressure generated in the infusion system was measured when the infusor bag pressure was maintained at 300 mmHg while the infusion bag was emptied in aliquots of 50 ml. Second, the pressures in the infusor bag required to maintain a pressure of 300 mmHg were measured as the infusion bag was emptied stepwise. The results reveal surprisingly large discrepancies between the pressure registered on the infusor manometer and the actual pressure generated in the fluid, which are not due to manometer inaccuracy. The degree of discrepancy depends on the amount of fluid that remains in the infusion bag and, when the infusor manometer shows a pressure of 300 mmHg, pressure in the fluid can be as much as 170 mmHg above or 200 mmHg below this value. Furthermore, it was impossible to maintain a pressure of 300 mmHg in the infusion system using one of the devices despite the fact that 100 ml fluid remained. The clinical significance of these findings is discussed.\r"

In three units the epidural service was shared with the obstetricians. A continuous anaesthetic presence was provided in 16 of 22 units. There was considerable variation in the attendance upon epidural patients by the anaesthetists. Instructions to midwives for top-ups and subsequent care of patients followed no uniform pattern. Midwife in-service training in the initial management of serious epidural complications and in cardiopulmonary resuscitation was inconsistent. In some units, the avoidance of aortocaval compression was not emphasised in the management of serious complications such as severe maternal hypotension, total spinal blockade or cardiac arrest of the parturient. The results obtained in this survey suggest that there is a need to review the requirements in the provision of obstetric epidural services and consideration should be given to the establishment of a generally accepted standard of practice.\r"

In group B 3% prilocaine with felypressin was used in a volume of 0.08 ml/kg body weight (i.e. equal total drug dosages). Use of the 3% solution resulted in highly significant reductions in the mean latency for analgesia of the nerve block and in the latency and degree of motor block achieved (p less than 0.005 in each case).

Maintenance anesthesia with fentanyl (1.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), 60% inspired nitrous oxide, and 0.7% inspired halothane resulted in regional dysfunction, measured as postsystolic shortening (20.6 +/- 10.7%), which was significantly worsened after 0.1 mg/kg (48.7 +/- 12.5%, P less than 0.05) and after 0.2 mg/kg (68.8 +/- 11.7%, P less than 0.05) intravenous diltiazem. Systolic shortening in the compromised LAD territory was substantially depressed after 0.1 mg/kg diltiazem (8.2 +/- 0.6% to 5.3 +/- 1.3%, P less than 0.05) and was essentially abolished after 0.2 mg/kg diltiazem (8.2 +/- 0.6% to 0.7 +/- 2.3%, P less than 0.05). At the higher dose of diltiazem, cardiac output was substantially decreased (1.37 +/- 0.23 L/min to 0.88 +/- 0.30 L/min, P less than 0.05) and LV dP/dtmax significantly depressed (1090 +/- 90 mm Hg/sec to 744 +/- 80 mm Hg/sec, P less than 0.05). These results demonstrate significant depression of regional systolic shortening and substantial worsening of regional dysfunction in myocardium with a compromised blood supply, in association with significant depression of left ventricular performance, with intravenous diltiazem administration during anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed in ten pentobarbital-anesthetized, open chest dogs to evaluate regional circulatory effects of isovolemic hemodilution alone, and in combination with adenosine-induced controlled hypotension. Regional blood flow measured with 15-microns radioactive microspheres was used to calculate regional oxygen supply. Hemodilution with 5% dextran (40,000 molecular weight) reduced arterial hematocrit and oxygen content by approximately one-half and caused heterogeneous changes in regional blood flows; flow decreased in the spleen, was unchanged in the renal cortex, liver, skeletal muscle and skin, and increased in the duodenum, pancreas, brain and myocardium; however, only in the brain and myocardium were increases in flow sufficient to preserve oxygen supply. Intravenous infusion of adenosine reduced aortic pressure by 50% and reduced flow in most tissues (renal cortex, pancreas, liver, spleen, skin, and brain), with the result that oxygen deficits were produced or accentuated in these organs. The magnitude of flow reductions in the renal cortex (-73%) and cerebral cortex (-37%) were noteworthy. In the myocardium, direct coronary vasodilation by adenosine caused parallel increases in blood flow and oxygen supply to levels exceeding prevailing metabolic requirements. It is concluded that 1) during isovolemic hemodilution alone, oxygen supply to the brain and myocardium is maintained at the expense of oxygen supply to less critical organs and, 2) during combined isovolemic hemodilution and adenosine-induced hypotension, oxygen is oversupplied to the myocardium but undersupplied to the brain and kidney. These latter effects suggest the need for extensive clinical monitoring of patients in whom combined isovolemic hemodilution and adenosine-induced hypotension is utilized.\r"

Recordings of several utterances were obtained by means of a microphone and an accelerometer attached to the skin at the midpoint of the suprasternal notch. Recordings were taken the day before induction of general anesthesia, 20 minutes after extubation, and 2 and 4 days after extubation. Waveforms of the recordings were subsequently assessed visually for features different from those of normal phonation as determined in preliminary studies. Waveforms in several of the recordings taken soon after extubation showed marked intraperiod and interperiod irregularities. These abnormalities improved and disappeared over the following 4 days. No changes were observed in the acoustic waveforms of seven patients given general anesthesia without tracheal intubation. The analysis of time-expanded acoustic waveforms of the larynx indicates that this technique has considerable potential as a sensitive, noninvasive technique that helps to evaluate the effects of tracheal intubation on laryngeal function, a technique that warrants further study and evaluation.\r"

The IV dose needed to achieve complete initial analgesia was 5.2 +/- 2.8 micrograms/kg buprenorphine and 166 +/- 100 micrograms/kg morphine. The duration of effect was significantly longer with buprenorphine than with morphine, 248 +/- 314 and 114 +/- 109 minutes, respectively (P = 0.03). The most common side effects were nausea and vomiting (28 and 16%) and urinary retention (21 and 19%) in the buprenorphine and morphine groups, respectively. Analgesia with sublingual buprenorphine was as effective and reliable as with intramuscular morphine but a longer duration of action could not be demonstrated.\r"

The combination's log dose response curves were significantly shifted to the left when compared with those of either relaxant alone; an increased potency is displayed by the combination. These observations indicate nondepolarizing muscle relaxant synergy for the combination of equal proportions of vecuronium and atracurium. The synergistic interaction of vecuronium and atracurium in this in vitro-model is not dependent on pharmacokinetic factors such as uptake, distribution, and biodegradation as are present in the in vivo animal models and in humans. Synergy of vecuronium and atracurium in vitro is a new finding and is consistent with hypotheses of multiple receptor sites and different modes of action of the \"competitive\" neuromuscular blocking agents. This degree of synergy, seen in the in vitro animal data, if extrapolatable to humans, is probably of little clinical significance.\r"

Patients with CRF weighed significantly less than did the control patients (28.7 +/- 5.7 vs 44.7 +/- 12.9 kg [mean +/- SD]). Although there was no statistical difference in the rate of clearance or apparent volume of distribution and half-life between the two groups, clearance and half-life were more variable among patients with CRF.

During inhibition of the micturition reflex, intravesical pressure rose with infusion until a continuous emission of urine (dribbling) was observed. Such a level of intravesical pressure (overflow pressure) was significantly greater than the premorphine bladder opening pressure (+56%). During dribbling, no periodic vesical contractions were observed, and the effects of a variety of agents on bladder tone were assessed. Significant (P less than 0.05) increases in vesical pressure over that produced by morphine were observed after intraperitoneal (ip) injection of carbachol (+86%), bethanechol (+55%), norepinephrine (+53%), methoxamine (+88%), and ST-91, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist (+70%). The increased vesical pressure was not accompanied by an increase in the rate of urine expression. Intraperitoneal injection of serotonin produced no effects on intravesical pressure or urine expression. Significant decreases in the otherwise elevated intravesical pressure were observed after ip injection of isoproterenol (-30%) and phentolamine (-21%), with no change in the rate of urine expression. In contrast, ip injection of apomorphine (dopamine agonist) resulted in significant decreases in vesical pressure (-49%) and near maximal emptying of the bladder. Apomorphine produced no effects on it morphine-induced antinociception as assessed by the tail flick response. Regarding potential treatments of spinal morphine-induced urinary retention, the present study suggests that: 1) cholinomimetic and alpha-adrenergic agonist agents might be harmful; 2) beta-adrenergic agonist and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents might be useful; and 3) dopaminergic agonist agents might be the drugs of choice.\r"

However, clonidine can produce vasoconstriction, and epidurally administered clonidine decreases spinal cord blood flow in anesthetized pigs. To examine the effect of epidurally administered clonidine on spinal cord blood flow in awake animals, the authors inserted lumbar epidural, femoral arterial and venous, pulmonary arterial, and left ventricular catheters in 13 adult sheep. Following a 24-h recovery, the authors injected saline (N = 6) or clonidine, 750 micrograms (17-25 micrograms/kg; N = 7) epidurally, and measured arterial blood gas tensions; temperature; heart rate; systemic and pulmonary arterial, right atrial, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures; and spinal cord and renal blood flows (by radioactive microsphere injection) before and at 45 min and 4 h following injection. Epidural saline injection did not affect measured variables. Heart rate decreased from 112 +/- 9 to 86 +/- 4 beats/min (mean +/- SE; P = .003) and arterial PO2 decreased from 99 +/- 3 to 78 +/- 6 mmHg (P = .04) 45 min following clonidine injection. Temperature increased from 39.1 +/- .2 to 40.6 +/- 1 degree C (P = .0001) 4 h following clonidine injection. Epidural clonidine administration did not affect cardiac output, pulmonary and systemic pressures, or renal or spinal cord blood flows, except for an increase in mid-thoracic spinal cord blood flow 45 min following injection. The authors conclude that, in sheep, epidural clonidine does not produce dangerous cardiovascular depression or global spinal cord ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The formation of acute edema in the tracheobronchial mucosa following local instillation of hydrochloric acid or gastric juice was studied in rats. Protein extravasation using the Evans blue technique was measured and used to indicate edema formation. A pH dependent Evans blue extravasation was observed whereby pH 2 produced a small, pH 1.5 an intermediate, and pH 1 a pronounced effect. Also, gastric juice (pH 1.3 +/- 0.1) induced a marked Evans blue extravasation in the tracheobronchial mucosa. Rats which had been pretreated with capsaicin (100 mg/kg s.c.) had a much lower Evans blue extravasation following local instillation of both hydrochloric acid and gastric juice. Thus, the increase in Evans blue content induced by acid at pH 1.5 was abolished while about 50% of the response remained at pH 1. The protein extravasation caused by gastric juice was reduced by about 70% after capsaicin treatment. Terbutaline (73 nmol/kg, iv) or enprophylline (25 mumol/kg, iv) injected intravenously 10 min before, as well as hydrocortisone injected immediately after the intratracheal instillation of gastric juice, did not influence the magnitude of edema formation. Beta-methasone (0.25 mg/kg ip) pretreatment 24 h prior to the gastric juice exposure enhanced tracheal extravasation. In conclusion, acute protein extravasation in the lower airway mucosa induced by hydrochloric acid or gastric juice is mainly dependent on capsaicin sensitive sensory nerves, suggesting that local release of mediators, such as tachykinins, play a key role in this reaction.\r"

Fourteen experiments were performed in 14 chronically instrumented pregnant guinea pigs near term. Immediately following a 1-h intravenous infusion of ritodrine (0.05-0.20 mg.kg.min-1), each animal received an intravenous bolus of vasopressor solution: 1) epinephrine, 0.001 mg/kg; 2) phenylephrine, 0.01 mg/kg; 3) mephentermine, 1.0 mg/kg; 4) ephedrine, 1.0 mg/kg; or 5) placebo. The experimental sequence was performed five times, so that each animal received all five solutions. The vasopressor sequence was randomly altered between animals. Infusion of ritodrine increased maternal heart rate 18 +/- 1% (P less than .0001), decreased maternal mean arterial pressure (MMAP) 4 +/- 1% (P less than .01), and decreased UBFV 5 +/- 1% (P less than .001). The four active vasopressor solutions resulted in similar, though not equivalent, increases in MMAP. Further, the MMAP response to each active vasopressor differed from the response to placebo (P less than .0001). Epinephrine and phenylephrine each significantly decreased UBFV (P less than .002). Ephedrine clearly preserved UBFV, whereas mephentermine appeared to result in an intermediate response.\r"

In some patients, this hypotension has apparently occurred independent of reduction in heart rate or systemic vascular resistance, suggesting decreased stroke volume. In the present study, the preload recuitable stroke work area (PRSWA) model was used to evaluate the negative inotropic effects of esmolol in nine chronically instrumented awake dogs. Left ventricular (LV) transmural pressure and minor axis diameter were measured by micromanometers and sonomicrometry, respectively. Vena caval occlusions were performed so that an analog of stroke work (area within LV transmural pressure-diameter loop) could be measured over a range of preloading conditions during esmolol infusions of 0, 100, 300, 1000, and 3000 micrograms/kg-1.min-1 (n = 9), and at 15 and 30 min after termination of esmolol (n = 8). The linear relationship between stroke work and end-diastolic diameter was characterized for each caval occlusion by a slope and x-intercept. PRSWA was calculated for each caval occlusion as slope/two times the square of the difference between x-intercept and the largest end diastolic diameter observed in the study of a particular dog. Heart rate was different from control (91 +/- 4) only at the highest esmolol dose (127 +/- 4). LV peak positive dP/dt, minor axis ejection shortening, stroke work, and PRSWA were depressed from control at esmolol doses greater than or equal to 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1.

Lung volumes and tidal changes in chest wall circumferences and gastric (delta Pgas) and esophageal (delta Pes) pressures were measured pre- and postoperatively. Volume displacement of the abdomen divided by tidal volume (delta VAB/VT) and delta Pgas/delta Pes were taken as indices of the diaphragmatic contribution to tidal breathing. These respiratory variables were obtained in the postoperative period, before and after epidural injection of 0.5% plain bupivacaine to achieve a block up to the T4 segment. UAS was constantly associated with a decrease in VT, delta VAB/VT, delta Pgas/delta Pes, and forced vital capacity (FVC). Epidural block was associated with an increase in VT, delta VAB/VT, and FVC. delta Pgas and delta Pgas/delta Pes returned to their preoperative values. It is concluded that: 1) diaphragmatic dysfunction observed after UAS is partially reversed by thoracic epidural block; and 2) that inhibitory reflexes of phrenic activity arising from the abdominal compartment (abdominal wall and/or viscera) could be involved in this diaphragmatic dysfunction.\r"

Blood was sampled at frequent intervals from 5 min to 600 min in all but one patients. Additional samples were taken at 720 and 840 min in five patients. Bupivacaine concentration was measured using gas chromatography. Protein binding was measured using ultrafiltration. Peak serum concentrations ranged between 0.55 and 1.93 micrograms/ml. The time to reach the peak ranged from 10 to 60 min. Terminal half-life (T1/2 beta) was 7.7 +/- 2.4h (mean +/- SD), the volume of distribution (Vss) was 3.9 +/- 2.01.kg, and the total body clearance (CL) was 7.1 +/- 3.2 ml.min.kg-1. The free fraction was markedly increased (0.16 +/- 0.07) when compared with published adult values, and showed a highly significant negative correlation with age. Alpha 1 acid glycoprotein measured in the same infants correlated significantly with age. In conclusion, pharmacokinetics of caudal bupivacaine in infants are characterized by Cmax of total drug similar to those observed in adults after epidural injection. The free fraction is increased at least until 6 months of life. This suggests caution in the use of bupivacaine in infants until we understand the clinical significance of this increased free fraction.\r"

Both Vf and Ra during the use of either muscle relaxant were not different than Vf and Ra when no muscle relaxant was used. Succinylcholine caused muscle fasciculations and raised CSF pressure transiently (increase of 5.5 +/- 1.0 cm H2O [mean +/- SD]), while vecuronium did not. When muscle relaxants were not used, it became difficult to distinguish the effects of cardiovascular and respiratory activity on the CSF pressure waveform, and the coefficient of variability for determination of cisternal outflow rates was increased, making Ra values less reliable. It is concluded that continuous infusion of succinylcholine or vecuronium do not affect Vf or Ra. When Vf and Ra are determined by the method of ventriculocisternal perfusion, immobilization of respiratory muscles improves both the reliability of Ra values and the usefulness of the CSF pressure waveform. If a muscle relaxant is used, either succinylcholine or vecuronium would be suitable for such studies.\r"

If so, ketamine should produce less analgesia in morphine tolerant animals, just as morphine does. To test this hypothesis, the analgesic effects of ketamine were tested in mice implanted with placebo pellets and in mice made tolerant to morphine through implantation of morphine pellets, using the abdominal constriction test. The test consisted of ip injection of 1% acetic acid, which caused stretching of hind limbs and constriction of abdominal muscles, also called writing. The number of writhes was counted for each mouse 10-15 min following acetic acid injection. Morphine pellet implanted mice treated with saline writhed 12.2 +/- 0.8 times (mean +/- SEM), not significantly different from 9.8 +/- 0.9 times seen in placebo pellet implanted mice. Treatment of the animals with ketamine at three doses of 20, 25, and 30 mg/kg, subcutaneously (sc), reduced the number of writhes in the placebo pellet implanted group to 5.8 +/- 0.8, 4.2 +/- 0.7, and 1.3 +/- 0.3, respectively. In the morphine pellet-implanted group, with the same doses of ketamine, the numbers of writhes were 10 +/- 0.9, 9.3 +/- 1.1, and 5.2 +/- 0.9, respectively. Morphine-tolerant animals writhed significantly more at each dose of ketamine, indicating that they were cross tolerant to the analgesic effects of ketamine.\r"

Using the diaphragmatic muscle as a representative of skeletal muscle, the changes in AchR were examined. The diaphragm, rather than limb muscles, was chosen to avoid the effects of wound contracture-induced immobilization and denervation of limb, which can also increase AchR in skeletal muscle. Study of changes in diaphragm also tested the hypothesis that increase in AchR are the result of a generalized systemic effect, and not limited to area of burn. Following a 45-55% body surface area thermal injury to the trunk (not limbs) of rats, AchR changes in the diaphragm were studied at 10, 14, 21, and 28 days after injury and compared to uninjured (control) rats. The AchR changes in the diaphragmatic muscle was assayed using 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin as the specific ligand. At 10, 14, and 21 days after thermal injury, the animals had an arrest in weight growth and the AchR concentration was increased to (mean +/- SE) 155 +/- 15% (P less than 0.02), 160 +/- 16% (P less than 0.003), and 141 +/- 16% (0.05 less than P less than 0.1), respectively, compared to control. At 28 days, probably because of wound healing and burn wound contracture, the size of thermally injured area was significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced to 19 +/- 4% of body surface area, and weight increased (P less than 0.001) compared to preburn weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 14 dogs, anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental. Following tracheal intubation, they were ventilated with isoflurane in oxygen. The chest was opened, the LAD coronary artery cannulated, and flow to it controlled with an autoperfusion circuit. Systolic shortening in the LAD and circumflex regions was measured with a sonomicrometer via pairs of piezo-electric crystals placed in the subendocardium. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres injected into the left atrium. Regional myocardial lactate metabolism was assessed by withdrawing blood from a catheter placed in the anterior cardiac vein. Measurements were made during the imposition of a stenosis on the perfusion circuit sufficient to decrease systolic shortening by 10-20%. The same stenosis was imposed three times in a randomized and balanced crossover design. Treatment with nitrous oxide was associated with small increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure (5 and 8%, respectively), as well as a 19% reduction in systolic shortening and a 30% fall in endo/epi blood flow ratio in the hypoperfused LAD region distal to the stenosis. Lactate extraction was low or negative during both anesthetics, but differences were not statistically significant. The data indicate that the substitution of 50% nitrous oxide for 0.4% isoflurane caused a reduction in mechanical function and a further maldistribution of blood flow in ischemic myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Adenosine was intravenously infused, at a rate of 90 +/- 20 (SEM) micrograms.kg-1.min-1, to reduce mean arterial blood pressure by approximately 20% (23 +/- 2% SEM, from 82 +/- 3 to 63 +/- 3 SEM mmHg) during a 20-min period. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance indices decreased by 36 +/- 3 and 32 +/- 6% (SEM), and cardiac index increased by 18 +/- 5%. Heart rate, ventricular filling pressures, and whole body oxygen consumption were not affected by adenosine. Despite the reduced mean arterial blood pressure, coronary sinus flow increased by 128 +/- 26% (SEM) in parallel with a 96 +/- 11% (SEM) increase in coronary sinus oxygen content. Left and right ventricular stroke work indices, as well as myocardial oxygen consumption, were maintained. ECG (12-lead) demonstrated signs of ischemia in one subject, while myocardial lactate uptake was unchanged in all subjects. In conclusion, adenosine-induced hypotension in patients with peripheral vascular disease increased cardiac index without affecting myocardial work, whole body, and myocardial oxygen consumptions. The marked increase in coronary sinus blood flow, indicating coronary vasodilation, was not related to increased myocardial work. Further information regarding myocardial effect of adenosine in patients with ischemic heart disease is warranted.\r"

Measurements of COHb levels were performed in a Radiometer OSM2 Hemoximeter. Determination of P50 was done using an IL 237 Tonometer, a Radiometer, OSM2 Hemoximeter, and a Corning 168 pH/Blood Gas Analyzer. Preeclamptic pregnant patients had a mean COHb level of 2.8%, whereas normal pregnant women had a mean COHb level of 0.7% (P less than 0.001). Preeclamptic patients also had a significantly lower (24.4 mmHg) P50 than normal pregnant women (P50 = 30.1 mmHg) (P less than 0.001). The authors conclude that a significant elevation of COHb in preeclamptic pregnant women is partly responsible for a significant decrease in P50 seen in preeclampsia.\r"

  ".W": "The emergency physician's disposition of patients with suspected myocardial ischemia is currently debated; some physicians believe that a subgroup of patients can be managed safely outside the coronary care unit. Clinical predictors are needed in assessing the patient with suspected myocardial ischemia to help identify this subgroup. Through a retrospective cohort study, we investigated the value of the initial emergency department ECG in discriminating between chest pain patients with low and high risk for immediately life-threatening complications. Two hundred eleven initially uncomplicated consecutive coronary care unit admissions with suspected unstable angina or myocardial infarction were studied. Patient outcome, including the incidence of myocardial infarction, complications, and mechanical and pharmacologic interventions, was reviewed. Immediately life-threatening complications included ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, shock, 2 degrees and 3 degrees block, and death. Mechanical interventions included electrocardioversion or defibrillation, endotracheal intubation, intra-aortic balloon pump, Swan-Ganz catheter, or pacemaker insertion. Pressors, antiarrhythmics, and vasodilators were the reviewed pharmacologic interventions. A positive ECG was defined by the presence of ST elevation or depression, T wave inversion, left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, paced rhythm, or new Q waves. All other ECG interpretations were considered negative. Patients were divided into two groups based on this initial emergency physician ECG interpretation and their complication incidences compared. Of the 211 patients, 96 had a positive ECG; 115 had negative ECGs. Patients with positive ECGs were older, had a greater history and concurrent incidence of myocardial infarction, and more complications and intensive interventions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined 144 battlefield casualties with penetrating intraperitoneal injury to determine whether patients in shock presented with pulse rates that were significantly more rapid than those in patients not in shock. No differences in mean pulse rates were found when using objective operational definitions of shock. In contrast, the only pulse rate difference was noted when shock was defined on the basis of the surgeon's subjective clinical impression and this was attributed to selection bias. The absence of a tachycardic response in battlefield casualties with penetrating abdominal wounds cannot be taken as an indication that serious injury and significant intraperitoneal bleeding have not occurred. Caution should be exercised when using this parameter as a guide for therapeutic interventions, and further study is indicated to determine whether a similar pattern is seen in civilian practice.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively studied the use of succinylcholine chloride and pancuronium bromide by the physician/nurse flight team of our hospital-based helicopter ambulance service. Patients who received these agents at the scene of an accident (prehospital group, n = 39) were compared with patients who were paralyzed by the flight team in the emergency department of transferring hospitals (control group, n = 35). By protocol, succinylcholine was used primarily for endotracheal intubation and pancuronium for prolonged paralysis after endotracheal intubation. Seventy-four patients received one or both agents. Overall, 61 of 74 patients had intracranial pathology as their primary diagnosis (82%). Endotracheal intubation was the primary indication for paralysis in the majority of patients (67 of 74), although intracranial pressure control, ventilation, agitation control, and seizure control were frequent secondary indications. Prior intubation attempts had failed in 40 of 74 patients (54%). After paralysis, intubation was successful in 68 of 71 patients (96%). Serious complications (ie, dysrhythmia requiring drug therapy) occurred in three patients but resolved with appropriate therapy in each case. Minor complications (ie, dysrhythmia not requiring drug therapy, histamine flush, infiltrated IV line) occurred in 18 patients. There was no significant difference in successful intubation or complication rate between the prehospital and control group. Paralysis allowed airway stabilization in a significant number of critically ill patients who could not otherwise be endotracheally intubated, with a lower incidence of complications than has been previously reported for ED patients. These results suggest that neuromuscular blocking agents can be used safely and effectively at accident scenes by a physician/nurse team.\r"

This results in rapid and profuse catharsis that could possibly cause fluid and electrolyte imbalance. An investigation was undertaken to determine if sorbitol catharsis enhanced the antidotal efficacy of activated charcoal. Eight healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, crossover trial. Subjects ingested 3 g of acetaminophen followed by either no intervention, 50 g of plain activated charcoal at one hour, or 50 g activated charcoal-sorbitol solution at one hour. Serial acetaminophen levels were determined at intervals over eight hours and side effects noted. Both interventions significantly reduced the area under the curve versus control (P less than .05). The addition of sorbitol did not enhance the efficacy of activated charcoal but did increase the side effects noted. Sorbitol has not been proven effective in enhancing drug removal and has side effects that can be significant in a poisoned patient. Current data do not warrant its use, and further investigations should be carried out with other ingested drugs.\r"

Overall mortality, degree of disability in survivors, and survival time after injury in fatally wounded patients were assessed. Ninety-eight percent of all patients with an initial GCS score of 8 or less died. When the GCS score was more than 8, 91% of patients survived (P less than .0001). Survival rate was significantly increased in patients with injury limited to one lobe of the brain, compared with patients with brain wounds of greater severity demonstrated on computerized tomographic scan (P less than .05), while a missile crossing both vertical anatomic planes of the brain or coming to rest in the posterior fossa was lethal in 100% of cases. Survivors scored relatively well on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Almost all (98%) fatally injured patients maintained vital functions for a time ample for transportation and evaluation at a major referral center.

The same samples were retested four hours later and the same sticks were tested after four months of aging. Variables controlled for included observer, lighting, performance according to package insert, pH, specific gravity, white blood cells, ascorbic acid, protein, age of dipstick, and exposure of urine to povidine or cleaning solutions. Results obtained using both N-Multistix and Chemstrip 9 urine dipsticks correlated closely with the degree of hematuria. Overall sensitivity was 100%, and specificity was 99.3%. We conclude that these urine dipsticks are reliable and are not affected when tested on urine four hours after void, and that Chemstrips 9 are much more reliable than are N-Multistix if aged in air for four months.\r"

  ".W": "Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm often presents with a pulsatile abdominal mass, abdominal pain, and hypotension. Recent clinical reports describe patients with less apparent clinical signs and symptoms who were found later in their evaluation to have a contained rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Even more unusual is a chronic contained rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Our patient had a chronic contained rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm that presented with erosion into the lumbar vertebral bodies and subsequent lumbar neuropathy. CT scan confirmed the contained rupture of the aortic aneurysm and the patient underwent successful repair of his aortic aneurysm. Our report discusses the significance of atypical presentations of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture and the importance of prompt diagnosis and definitive repair.\r"

A 36-year-old woman with previously undiagnosed distal renal tubular acidosis presented with foot and ankle swelling that was being treated with furosemide. She had been seen by three physicians within 24 hours and was diagnosed as having depression or hysterical conversion reaction. Her symptoms progressed to respiratory arrest. Initial treatment consisted of administering 40 mEq of KCl over one hour through a central venous line. The patient recovered rapidly and was weaned off a respirator within 24 hours of admission.\r"
