  ".W": "The epidemiology of Guillain-Barre syndrome was examined in a population-based retrospective study using defined diagnostic criteria and linked hospital records. Between 1974 and 1986 there were 72 incident cases, giving a crude annual incidence rate (95 per cent confidence interval) of 1.1 per 100,000 persons per year (0.8-1.4). Age-adjusted incidence rates were insignificantly higher for women, 1.23 (0.8-1.6), than for men, 1.0 (0.6-1.3). After infancy, rates increased with age, and remained high in the over-75 age group. These variations in incidence were not explained by variations in severity. There was evidence of an increase in rates over the period surveyed. Rates tended to be higher in the winter and early spring. The incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome in the elderly has been underestimated in the past, and this study shows no evidence of a previously reported bimodal distribution of age-specific incidence in adult life.\r"

For the purposes of this discussion, these entities can be classified according to the radiographic appearance of the skull, which may be similar in a variety of different diseases. Enlarged parietal foramina, sinus pericranii, aplasia cutis congenita, anterior fontanelle dermoid, cephaloceles, and craniolacunia are all examples of loceles, and craniolacunia are all examples of calvarial defects. Although there are numerous causes for wormian bones (Table 1), OI, cleidocranial dysplasia, congenital hypothyroidism, and hypophosphatasia are disorders that are commonly associated with defective ossification and the appearance of wormian bones. Osteopetrosis is an important example of rare bony dysplasias that cause sclerosis and hyperostosis of the skull. A partial list of other disorders causing similar radiographic findings is found in Table 2. Craniosynostosis results in an abnormality of skull shape. The suture(s) involved may be predicted by the deformed calvarial configuration. Knowledge of the growth and development of the skull and an understanding of the varied causes of congenital skull anomalies can enable the radiologist to provide the diagnosis or an informed differential diagnosis when confronted with a specific radiographic finding.\r"

  ".U": "91149538\r", 
  ".W": "Congenital anomalies of the airway are generally uncommon, but a vast array of possibilities exists. Some present life-threatening emergencies at birth, and others go undiagnosed for years. Clinical symptoms are often nonspecific, and radiographic evaluation is frequently requested to localize and characterize the lesion before endoscopy, surgery, or medical management. The most common intrinsic congenital anomalies causing airway compromise in infants include choanal atresia, mandibular hypoplasia, laryngomalacia, vocal cord paralysis, and congenital subglottic stenosis. The radiologist must be on the alert for unsuspected additional anomalies involving the airway, lungs, and esophagus, which occur with relative frequency. Numerous extrinsic congenital masses of the head, neck, and mediastinum may compromise the airway. Hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, and teratomas are more likely to be noted at birth, whereas branchial cleft cysts, thyroglossal duct anomalies, and dermoid cysts frequently present later. Mass location and radiographic characteristics usually allow accurate preoperative diagnosis. Intracranial involvement by nasal or nasopharyngeal masses, intrathoracic involvement by lower neck mass, and intraspinal involvement by posterior neck mass must always be sought for radiographically. Persistence of respiratory symptoms after removal of such masses is not uncommon because tracheal deformity and laxity may take months or years to resolve. Recent advances in cine CT and MR imaging promise to improve imaging of the airway in general and in the pediatric population in particular. Significant limitations in imaging of the pediatric larynx remain. As a result, endoscopy continues to be the primary diagnostic tool for airway anomalies of this region.\r"

  ".U": "91149539\r", 
  ".W": "Bronchopulmonary foregut malformations encompass a great variety of anomalies that may arise from abnormal differentiation of the respiratory and alimentary tracts, abnormal separation of the two systems, or abnormal development of blood supply, perhaps singly or in combination, during early embryogenesis. The pulmonary and neurenteric forms share the common features of a pulmonary parenchymal opacification and/or intrathoracic mass, with the addition of vertebral anomalies in the instance of the neurenteric malformations. Plain radiographs serve as the starting point for diagnostic evaluation and sometimes are all that is needed; more often, though, the plain film findings suggest which road to follow in further imaging. No single imaging approach can be advocated for all patients. The lesion may be found initially, for example, on prenatal sonography. Ultrasonography also can establish the cystic nature of a mass and may help define vascular supply, although it cannot yet be said to have supplanted angiography's role in evaluating suspected sequestrations. For most intramediastinal or intrapulmonary masses without associated vertebral anomalies, CT will satisfactorily establish the cystic nature and should afford a reasonably confident preoperative diagnosis of bronchogenic cysts or type 1 or 2 cystic adenomatoid malformations. Type 3 cystic adenomatoid malformation, because of its relatively \"solid\" imaging characteristics, may not be diagnosed confidently by preoperative imaging. The finding of vertebral anomalies associated with a mediastinal mass especially warrants MR imaging to define intraspinal involvement. However, the association of vertebral or rib anomalies with apparent unilateral pulmonary agenesis or hypoplasia arouses suspicion of a bronchopulmonary foregut malformation that communicates with the gastrointestinal tract, and this uncommon situation calls for a barium examination. Radionuclide scintigraphy has an ancillary role in assessing foregut anomalies, but many findings from scintigraphy are relatively nonspecific and anatomic definition is poor. Scintigraphy may yield supportive information in cases of sequestration that have inconclusive findings as determined by plain radiographs and CT.\r"

As noted, congenital abnormalities of the spine are relatively uncommon but may be of profound clinical significance. During the past decade, the most significant developments in the diagnosis and treatment of these abnormalities have been ultrasonography, CT scanning, and MR imaging. In the neonate, the spinal cord and neural outflow can be evaluated by ultrasonography until the osseous elements begin to fuse. Thereafter, MR imaging is the procedure of choice because it permits evaluation of the spine and spinal cord in all planes of imaging and provides detailed evaluation of the effect of osseous abnormalities on neural structures. Finally, plain radiographs of the spine for evaluation of neonates who have any of a spectrum of sacral dimples are rarely helpful, and in the presence of significant cutaneous or subcutaneous abnormalities, ultrasonography is the preferred modality for evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular factors controlling alternative splicing of precursor messenger RNA are largely unknown, even though this process plays a central role in specifying the diversity of proteins in the eukaryotic cell. For the identification of such factors, a segment of the rat preprotachykinin gene was used in which differential expression of neuropeptides gamma and K is dependent on alternative splicing of the fourth exon (E4). Sequence variants of the three-exon segment, (E3-E4-E5) were created, resulting in a sensitive assay for factors mediating the splicing switch between E4-skipping and E4-inclusion. A dinucleotide mutation in the 5' splice site of E4 that increase base-pairing of this site to U1 small nuclear RNA resulted in uniform selection of E4, whereas a control mutation that destroyed base-pairing resulted in uniform E4-skipping. Affinity selection of spliceosomes formed on these functionally distinct substrates revealed that the extreme difference in splicing was mediated by differential binding of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) to the 5' splice site of E4. These data show that, apart from its established role in selecting 5' splice sites, U1 snRNP plays a fundamental role in 3' exon selection and provides insight into possible mechanisms of alternative splicing.\r"

  ".W": "Picosecond phase-grating spectroscopy is highly sensitive to density changes and provides a new holographic approach to the study of protein dynamics. Photodissociation of carbon monoxide from heme proteins induces a well-defined transition from a ligated to a deoxy structure that is important to hemoglobin and myoglobin functionality. Grating spectroscopy was used to observe protein-driven density waves on a picosecond time scale after carbon monoxide dissociation. This result demonstrates that global tertiary structure changes of proteins occur on an extremely fast time scale and provides new insight into the biomechanics of deterministic protein motion.\r"

  ".W": "The mammalian transcription factor AP-2 is a retinoic acid inducible sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that is developmentally regulated. In this report, the functional domains necessary for AP-2 DNA binding were studied. AP-2 required a dimerization domain and an adjacent region of net basic charge to achieve a sequence-specific protein:DNA interaction. The sequences responsible for dimerization consisted of two putative amphipathic alpha helices separated by a large intervening span region. This helix-span-helix (HSH) domain was unable to bind DNA when separated from the basic region, but was still capable of dimerization. The ability of the HSH domain to function as a module that promotes DNA binding through dimerization was further demonstrated by attaching it to the heterologous basic region of the c-Jun proto-oncogene product. The resulting chimeric protein specifically recognized an AP-1 DNA-binding site in the absence of an intact c-Jun leucine repeat and in a manner that was dependent on the presence of a functional AP-2 dimerization domain.\r"

  ".W": "Although left ventricular (LV) aneurysm is associated with increased mortality, its independent prognostic significance is controversial. To determine the effect of LV aneurysm on risk, 121 patients with healed myocardial infarction (MI), 55 manifesting akinesia on ventriculography (MI group) and 66 with LV aneurysm characterized by diastolic deformity (eccentricity) and systolic dyskinesia (LV aneurysm group) were studied. At a mean follow-up of 5.7 years, there were 32 cardiac deaths (12 MI vs 20 LV aneurysm), including 9 sudden deaths (1 MI vs 8 LV aneurysm). Multivariate analysis revealed decreasing ejection fraction to be the best predictor of total cardiac death, and revascularization to be protective. Nonsudden cardiac death was predicted by ejection fraction, absence of revascularization and right coronary artery disease, whereas sudden cardiac death was predicted by LV aneurysm and the frequency of ventricular ectopic complexes on Holter monitoring. In the MI group, ejection fraction was the only significant predictor of total cardiac death and nonsudden cardiac death. In the LV aneurysm group, total cardiac death, as well as nonsudden cardiac death, were predicted by ejection fraction, ventricular tachycardia and right coronary artery disease, whereas ventricular tachycardia predicted sudden cardiac death. It is concluded that the risk profile for total cardiac death differs between LV aneurysm and MI patients, and that LV aneurysm constitutes an independent predictor of late sudden cardiac death after MI. Moreover, on a substrate of LV aneurysm, the risk factors for sudden cardiac death and nonsudden cardiac death differ, with ventricular tachycardia being the sole predictor of sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, Holter monitoring is valuable in identifying patients at persistent risk of sudden cardiac death.\r"

To address this issue, 88 patients with significant (greater than or equal to 50%) coronary artery disease presenting with angina--new onset (n = 38), worsening (n = 20) or at rest (n = 30)-were studied. Patients with left main artery disease, normal coronary arteries or occlusion of the ischemia-related arteries were not included in the study. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings were obtained during the first 24 hours. Angiography was performed within 1 week from admission. Complex morphology was defined as any stenosis with irregular borders, overhanging edges or intracoronary thrombus. Only data referring to the in-hospital outcome were considered in this study. Adverse end points were sudden death, myocardial infarction and emergency revascularization. Analysis of the angiograms revealed a complex morphology in 58 patients (group 1). The remaining 30 patients served as control subjects (group 2). Thirty-two of the 58 group 1 patients had an unfavorable clinical outcome (positive predictive value, 55%). A similar outcome occurred in only 2 of the 30 group 2 patients (negative predictive value, 93%). Of the 32 group 1 patients who had an unfavorable clinical outcome, 29 had a cumulative duration of transient myocardial ischemia of greater than or equal to 60 minutes per 24 hours. A similar duration of ischemia, however, was observed in another 6 group 1 and in 8 group 2 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Duration and magnitude of ST-segment deviation and heart rate at the onset of ischemia were similar in the 86 symptomatic and the 255 asymptomatic episodes with ECG changes. The 104 episodes of angina pectoris without ECG changes were detected in 44 patients (34%) (group A); 29 of them had only episodes with angina pectoris and 15 patients had both--episodes of angina pectoris with and without ECG changes. In 84 patients (66%) (group B) angina pectoris without ECG changes was not observed; all episodes were accompanied by ischemic ECG changes in these patients. No differences in the angiographic extent of coronary artery disease and in exercise test data were seen in both groups A and B; however, maximal ST-segment depression during exercise testing was significantly greater in group B than in group A patients (2.4 +/- 0.8 mm vs 1.9 +/- 0.9 mm; p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Simultaneous high-fidelity left ventricular pressure measurements were performed in all patients. A programmed single-coupled right ventricular extrasystole was induced during echocardiographic and subsequent cineangiocardiographic recordings. Adequate angiograms for volumetric analysis in both baseline and PES beats were obtained in 23 patients (7 in the control group and 16 in the MI group). PES potentiation of contraction was more pronounced in the MI group than in the control group. PES changes in ejection fraction, stroke volume and end-systolic volume were significantly greater in the MI group than in the control group (11 vs 5%, p less than 0.005; 15 vs 5 ml/m2, p less than 0.005; and -13 vs -4 ml/m2, p less than 0.01, respectively). In contrast, PES potentiation prolonged the time constants of left ventricular pressure decline derived from exponential curve fits with a zero (Tw) and non-zero (Tb) asymptote pressure in the MI group to the same extent as in the control group (4 vs 5 ms, difference not significant [NS], and 9 vs 11 ms, NS, respectively).

CAD, defined as greater than or equal to 25% diameter narrowing in a major coronary artery, was present in 106 men (85%) and 54 women (75%). Multiple regression analyses revealed that only high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level in men, and age and total/HDL cholesterol ratio in women, were independently associated with the presence of CAD after adjustment for other risk factors. HDL cholesterol level and age were significantly correlated with both extent (number of diseased vessels) and severity (percent maximum stenosis) of CAD in men. In women, age was the only independent variable related to severity, whereas age and total/HDL cholesterol ratio were related to extent. Of 71 patients with total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dl, 79% had CAD. With multiple regression analyses, HDL cholesterol was the only variable independently related to the presence and severity of CAD in these patients after adjustment for age and gender; extent was significantly associated with age and male gender, and was unrelated to any of the lipid parameters. With use of multiple logistic and linear regression analyses of the group of 197 patients, HDL cholesterol was the most powerful independent variable associated with the presence and severity of CAD after adjustment for age and gender. HDL cholesterol was also an independent predictor of extent. Age was independently associated with each of the end points examined, and was the variable most significantly related to extent. These data add to the growing body of information demonstrating an important association between HDL and CAD.\r"

Accordingly, minimal luminal cross-sectional area was determined by 2 methods, edge detection and densitometry, in 19 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and then coronary stent implantation for symptomatic coronary stenoses. The correlation coefficient, 0.73 before angioplasty, decreased to 0.59 after coronary angioplasty and then increased to 0.83 after stent implantation. The mean differences between edge detection and densitometric determinations of minimal luminal cross-sectional area were 0.31 +/- 0.51 mm2 before PTCA, -0.38 +/- 1.22 mm2 after angioplasty and 0.35 +/- 0.79 mm2 after coronary stenting. It is concluded that, although the correlation and variability in the measurement of minimal luminal cross-sectional area between edge detection and densitometry deteriorate after PTCA, they are improved after stenting, probably because of smoothing of the vessel contours by the stent and remodeling of the stented segment into a more circular configuration. Therefore, in the stented coronary artery, edge detection and densitometry are equally acceptable methods of analysis.\r"

One hundred six patients with 119 ostial branch stenoses were compared with 1,168 patients who underwent angioplasty of nonostial branch stenoses. An ostial branch stenosis was defined as a stenosis in the proximal 3 mm of a major branch vessel (diagonal [n = 58], posterior descending [n = 21], obtuse marginal [n = 34] and intermediate [n = 6]). The ostial branch stenosis was isolated in 61% of the patients and associated with a bifurcation stenosis in 39%. Despite a balloon to artery ratio of 1.05:1, angiographic success was 74% of ostial branch stenoses versus 91% of nonostial stenoses (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, angioplasty of ostial branch stenoses resulted in a complication rate of 13 versus 5% for angioplasty of nonostial branch stenoses (p less than 0.01). Therefore, angioplasty of ostial branch stenoses results in decreased procedural success and significant residual stenosis despite adequate balloon sizing, suggesting arterial elastic recoil and a significant increase in complications.\r"

The study recorded changes in fasting plasma lipids, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After establishing baseline lipid/lipoprotein levels in a 3-week period during which all participants received the currently marketed formulation, the men were randomized into 2 groups, 1 group (n = 31) taking the new Questran Light formulation of 4 g of cholestyramine in 5 g of powder per pack, while the other group (n = 30) continued to take the marketed Questran formulation of 4 g of cholestyramine in 9 g of powder per pack. Each group consumed a total of 24 g/day of cholestyramine in 2 divided doses. At the end of the maintenance phase of the study there were no statistically significant mean changes in percentage from baseline to end-point lipid/lipoprotein levels within either group, nor were there any significant differences between the Questran Light group or the currently marketed Questran formulation group. The new low-calorie cholestyramine formulation appears to be equally as effective in maintaining lowered plasma cholesterol levels as the currently marketed formulation.\r"

In 15 patients with anterograde decremental conduction, the accessory pathway was right parietal or septal in 14 patients and left parietal in 1 patient. In the 40 patients with retrograde decrement, the accessory pathway was left parietal in 19, posteroseptal in 13, right parietal in 2 and right anteroseptal in 6 patients. Anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway was absent in 11 of the 40 patients with retrograde decrement. Retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway was absent in 9 patients with anterograde decrement. There was no significant difference in the accessory pathway effective refractory period, or shortest cycle length with 1:1 conduction over the accessory pathway in anterograde and retrograde directions. The shortest RR interval in atrial fibrillation between 2 preexcited QRS complexes was longer in patients with anterograde decremental conduction than in a control group of patients with anterograde-conducting accessory pathways without decremental properties. These data demonstrate that decremental conduction over accessory pathways is uncommon. Anterograde decremental conduction usually occurs in right-sided or septal pathways that often do not conduct in the retrograde direction.\r"

The individual efficacy criterion (greater than or equal to 75% VPC reduction) was achieved in 34% of low-dose and 71% of high-dose sotalol versus 6% of placebo-treated patients (p less than 0.003, sotalol vs placebo; p = 0.007, high vs low dose). Repetitive beats were suppressed 25% by placebo (difference not significant), 80% by low-dose (p less than 0.003) and 78% by high-dose sotalol (p less than 0.005). Sotalol decreased heart rate (by 24 to 25%, p less than 0.001) and increased PR (by 4 to 6%, p less than 0.001) and corrected JT intervals (by 12 to 13%, p less than 0.001), but did not change ejection fraction. Proarrhythmia (nonfatal) occurred in 3 sotalol and in 2 placebo patients. Nine discontinued therapy because of adverse effects (1 low dose and 8 high dose, p less than 0.02). In summary, sotalol is an efficacious antiarrhythmic drug for VPC suppression; in lower doses, it is somewhat less effective but better tolerated.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the hemodynamic results of different anuloplasty techniques of primary valve repair for mitral regurgitation, 122 patients were prospectively studied with Doppler echocardiograms 5 to 10 days after operation. Seventy-seven patients had mitral valve prolapse, 27 had coronary artery disease, 13 patients had rheumatic mitral valve lesions and 5 patients had infective endocarditis. Forty-eight patients received the flexible Duran ring, 46 received the more rigid Carpentier ring and 28 patients received no ring. Doppler echocardiography demonstrated a significant decrease in mitral valve area estimated by the pressure half-time method in patients who received either a Carpentier (2.6 +/- 0.8 cm2) or Duran ring (2.8 +/- 0.8 cm2) when compared with patients who received no ring (3.2 +/- 0.7 cm2) (p = 0.01). No significant differences were observed for peak transmitral diastolic velocity, peak transmitral diastolic gradient, or the grade of mitral regurgitation by color flow Doppler mapping between patients with and without rings. The etiology of mitral disease and concomitant surgical procedures accompanying mitral valve repair did not significantly influence mitral valve area, peak velocity or peak gradient. These data suggest that Carpentier and Duran rings decrease the hemodynamic mitral valve area; however, the decrease in valve area is small and not associated with a clinically important increase in transvalvular gradient.\r"

At the highest atropine dose, heart rate increased from 60 +/- 9 to 105 +/- 8 beats/min (mean +/- standard deviation), the diastolic filling period decreased by 61% (573 +/- 141 to 222 +/- 34 ms), the peak early (E) filling decreased 23% (77 +/- 12 to 61 +/- 11 cm/s), the peak atrial (A) filling increased 103% (40 +/- 6 to 81 +/- 17 cm/s), and the E/A ratio decreased by 60% (2.0 +/- 0.5 to 0.8 +/- 0.3) (all p less than 0.001). These alterations were not correlated to changes in systolic function, preload, blood pressure or plasma catecholamines, all of which were unchanged. However, atropine-induced changes in diastolic filling period were highly correlated to changes in E peak (r = 0.64, p less than 0.01), A peak (r = -0.95, p less than 0.001) and the E/A ratio (r = 0.93, p less than 0.001). The effects of atropine on the E/A ratio were normalized by dividing the E/A ratio by the diastolic filling period (E/A/diastolic filling period).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied 22 consecutive patients referred to an esophageal diagnostic center for evaluation of noncardiac chest pain or dysphagia having high amplitude esophageal contractions, 14 of whom completed the study. Diltiazem (60-90 mg qid) was compared with placebo, each being administered for 8 wk. Patients were evaluated with esophageal motility pre- and posttreatment periods and with regular symptom assessment throughout each 8-wk treatment. Active diltiazem therapy resulted in significantly lower (p less than 0.05) mean distal esophageal peristaltic pressure (128 +/- 20 mm Hg; +/- SE) than placebo (158 +/- 16 mm Hg). Mean chest pains scores were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower with diltiazem therapy than with placebo. Only nine of the 14 patients fulfilled presently acceptable criteria for diagnosing nutcracker esophagus, and the diltiazem effect was similar, although not significant, because of the smaller sample. Conclusions: In this preliminary study involving 14 patients, the oral calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, appeared to improve noncardiac chest pain associated with strong esophageal contraction, the nutcracker esophagus. These improved symptoms were associated with significant decreases in contraction pressure.\r"

In two patients, chronic inflammatory changes were observed in the graft mucosa, consisting of mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria accompanied by crypt dilatation and deformation. In one of these patients, the inflammation was in the proximal third of the graft, and it was also seen at the endoscopy. In the remaining 34 patients, the graft mucosa was microscopically comparable to normal. The alterations were unexpectedly few and mild considering the marked change in the location and function of the colonic segment.\r"

The present study examined the perception of life events and, in addition, the role of daily \"hassles\" (stressful events) in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia. Thirty-three dyspeptic patients as defined by normal endoscopy and ultrasonogram and 33 controls of comparable sex, age, and social class were recruited for study. Both groups were asked to select from 56 major life events those they had experienced and to give a rating on how they perceived them. They were further asked to select similarly from 117 items of daily stress and to rate the severity of each item. The results demonstrated that the number of positive and negative events and the positive score were similar in both dyspeptic patients and controls, but dyspeptic patients had a higher perceived magnitude of negative events and a higher score of total life change as given by the summation of magnitude of positive and negative events (both p less than 0.05). The \"hassles\" scores were not significantly different between dyspeptic patients and controls. Analysis of individual life events revealed that dyspeptic patients had significantly (p less than 0.05) higher scores than controls in items of minor law violations, major change in closeness of family members, and major personal illness or injury. We conclude that patients with nonulcer dyspepsia have higher negative perception of major life events, which indicates that psychological factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of nonulcer dyspepsia.\r"

Based on the morphological structure, the microvasculatures were divided into high endothelial cell vessels (HEV) and flat endothelial cell vessels (FEV). There were distinct phenotypic differences between HEV and FEV in lymphoma tissues. HEV were characterized as OKM1- OKM5-, accompanied by the cluster of non-neoplastic T lymphocytes, and FEV were OKM1- OKM5+ not accompanied by T lymphocyte infiltration. Factor VIII-related antigen was clearly identified in both EnC, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens and interleukin 1 were absent or only faintly visible on EnC in lymphoma tissues, whereas they were expressed on EnC in non-lymphoma tissues. These findings suggest that microvascular EnC in primary B cell lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract lack a property as antigen-presenting cells, and that HEV are involved in the migration of non-neoplastic T lymphocytes.\r"

In order to determine why diagnosis is made late, we reviewed the records of all patients with small bowel malignancy diagnosed between 1967 and 1988. The time from the onset of symptoms to the first medical contact and the time from medical contact until diagnosis were evaluated in 77 patients. The average delay in diagnosis attributable 1) to the patient failing to report symptoms was less than 2 months, 2) to the physician not ordering the appropriate diagnostic test was 8.2 months, and 3) to the radiologist failing to make the diagnosis was 12 months. Thus, the major delay in diagnosis was after medical help was sought and not from the onset of symptoms to first medical consultation. Physicians must increase their sensitivity to the subtle but persistent symptoms that necessitate a small bowel evaluation.\r"

We measured alpha 1-ATCL at the end of the 1st and 4th wk, and a new jejunal biopsy was obtained at the end of the 4th wk. By wk 1, alpha 1-ATCL was abnormal in 11 patients but normal in one. By wk 4, alpha 1-ATCL was abnormal in 10 patients and still normal in one. The post-challenge biopsies showed atrophy in 11 and was normal only in the patient with normal alpha 1-ATCL at wk 1 and 4. One patient with abnormal alpha 1-ATCL had to stop the challenge at the first week. The patient with normal clearance at wk 1 and 4 and normal biopsy at wk 4 had abnormal results at 6 months. These data support our hypothesis that alpha 1-ATCL can be used as evidence of gluten toxicity after gluten challenge, and that this test can be abnormal as early as 1 wk after gluten is reintroduced.\r"

  ".W": "An analysis of postmortem investigations between 1980 and 1985 revealed 43 patients with acute pancreatitis. In 13 (30.2%) of them, the diagnosis was first established at autopsy. In eight of the latter patients, the diagnosis could have been present on admission. The etiology was alcoholism in three patients, hypothermia in one, biliary tract disease in one, and unknown in three patients. In five patients, acute pancreatitis developed after gastric, pancreatic, or biliary tract surgery. Abdominal pain was present in only one patient. Amylase levels had been estimated in 11 patients, but the level was in the diagnostic range (greater than or equal to 3 times of upper normal level) in only four. Consequently, ultrasound examination was performed in only two of the latter four patients, but failed to show the pancreas because of intestinal gas. To diagnose acute pancreatitis at an earlier stage and to improve therapy and prognosis, we recommend that serum amylase levels be measured and ultrasound examination be performed. If the results are inconclusive, this should be followed by computed tomography for all abdominal emergency cases and for patients who have undergone cardiopulmonary or upper abdominal surgery, especially when the patients deteriorate or fail to improve postoperatively.\r"

Patients were randomized to receive alpha 2a-interferon (INF), 3 MU im three times weekly for 12 months, or no treatment (10 patients per group). Five patients receiving IFN showed a marked decrease or negativization of HBV-DNA during treatment. At the end of the study (after 18 month), three patients lost HBV-DNA permanently, and two of them seroconverted to HBeAb 10 and 11 months after disappearance of HBV-DNA with normalization of aminotransferase values. In the control group, one patient had spontaneous clearance of HBV-DNA with conversion to HBeAb and normalization of aminotransferase levels. All treated patients had a febrile reaction in the first month of treatment. The dose of IFN had to be decreased in two patients and was discontinued for persistent intolerance in one of them. Patients who showed a decreased viral replication had higher initial biochemical and histological activity than nonresponders. The data suggest that IFN treatment may favorably influence the progression of chronic B hepatitis in children with a history of acute hepatitis and active chronic disease.\r"

Hepatitis B and D infection are commonly associated with intravenous drug abuse, but there have been no previous reports of an association with nonparenteral cocaine. Crack use, via sexual promiscuity, is associated with an increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection, but has never been associated with viral hepatitis. We report four fatal cases of fulminant hepatitis B including, one with delta virus coinfection and one with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, in young, sexually active, heterosexual crack users. These patients denied a history of intravenous drug abuse. Our patients probably contracted hepatitis B infection via heterosexual contact. Chronic cocaine exposure may or may not have contributed to the fulminant outcome. Crack users may be at increased risk of developing hepatitis B and D infection. Epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate their risk of viral hepatitis and the effect of cocaine on its outcome.\r"

The positivity rate of PIVKA-II was significantly decreased in patients receiving vitamin K (28.5%), compared with those without vitamin K administration (54.5%, p less than 0.05). The plasma levels of vitamin K derivatives [phylloquinone (VK1), menaquinone-4 (MK4), and menaquinone-7 (MK7)] measured were not decreased in patients with HCC, but were significantly increased in MK4 and VK1 + MK4 + MK7. The amount of PIVKA-II in plasma did not correlate with the plasma levels of vitamin K derivatives. However, PIVKA-II was decreased by the administration of vitamin K, and all of the six patients with more than 5.0 ng/ml of VK1 + MK4 + MK7 were within normal limits, whereas half of 32 patients with less than that had abnormal levels of PIVKA-II. Thus, it was suggested that PIVKA-II was not elevated due to vitamin K deficiency, but might result from the impaired metabolism or availability of vitamin K in the tumor. Therefore, PIVKA-II should be measured without vitamin K administration.\r"

Providers of prenatal care in Rochester, NY, were offered free testing of all their prenatal patients and genetic counseling of women found positive. The 18,907 prenatal samples tested in a 5-year period represented 35.1% of the pregnancies in the Rochester metropolitan region. A hemoglobinopathy was found in 810 pregnancies (4.3%). Of the 21 different types of hemoglobinopathies detected, the most common were sickle cell trait (59%), hemoglobin C trait (19%), beta-thalassemia trait (11%), and hemoglobin E trait (5%). At the time of phlebotomy, 75% of the pregnancies were of less than 18 wk duration. Sixty-six percent of the pregnancies occurred in patients unaware of their diagnosis, and 80% occurred in patients unaware that they might be at risk for a child with a serious blood disorder. Of the 810 positive pregnancies, 551 (68%) occurred in patients who came for counseling. Of 453 women counseled during their first screened pregnancy, 390 (86%) said they wanted their partners tested and 254 (55%) had their partner tested. In the 77 pregnancies thus found to be at risk, the couple was too late for prenatal diagnosis in 12 cases, and the condition for which the fetus was at risk was too mild in 12 cases. Prenatal diagnosis was offered in the remaining 53 pregnancies and was accepted by 25 couples (47%). These results indicate that unselected patients in the primary care setting in this region, even though pregnant, are receptive to and utilize genetic information.\r"

In this report we describe learning as a result of genetic counseling of 298 pregnant women identified as hemoglobinopathy carriers, 234 with sickle cell trait and 64 with beta-thalassemia trait. Counseling was designed to provide the information needed in a simple, clear, and nondirective manner. A special videotape produced for this purpose provided dramatization and a role model illustrating an appropriate response. After viewing the videotape the counselee had an opportunity to question the counselor and to have any misconceptions corrected. Questionnaires revealed significantly increased knowledge as a result of counseling in each of the three hemoglobinopathy subject areas tested-namely, clinical manifestations, genetics, and prenatal diagnosis. Five factors correlated with higher knowledge scores after counseling-namely, a younger patient age, more years of education, knowledge of having trait before this identification, knowledge of the baby's father having trait before counseling, and having no prior children.\r"

A woman identified as a carrier may face three decisions. The first is whether to accept the offer of counseling. The second is whether to have her partner tested. If her partner also tests positive, then the third decision is whether to accept the offer of prenatal diagnosis. This report analyzes factors affecting her decision, with special attention being given to factors invoked by the Health Belief Model. Factors predicting that a patient who we identified as a carrier would come for counseling included the following: patient had no prior knowledge that she is a carrier (P less than .001), a gestational age less than 18 wk (P less than .01), and Caucasian race (P less than .05). For sickle cell trait counselees and beta-thalassamia trait counselees, factors found to predict patient's intent to have partner tested were the following: a greater postcounseling knowledge of the disease (P less than .009), a lesser perceived burden of intervention (P less than .011), and belief that the partner is also a carrier (P less than .008). Also for sickle cell trait counselees and beta-thalassemia trait counselees, factors predicting that the partner actually will be tested were the following: living with the partner (P less than .001), gestational age at identification less than or equal to 18 wk (P less than .001), a lesser perceived burden of intervention (P less than .002), and a greater perceived seriousness of the disease (P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of familial mental retardation and is characterized by a fragile site at the end of the long arm of the X chromosome. The unusual genetics and cytogenetics of this X-linked condition make genetic counseling difficult. DNA studies were of limited value in genetic counseling, because the nearest polymorphic DNA loci had recombination fractions of 12% or more with the fragile X mutation, FRAXA. Five polymorphic loci have recently been described in this region of the X chromosome. The positions of these loci in relation to FRAXA were defined in a genetic linkage study of 112 affected families. The five loci--DXS369, DXS297, DXS296, IDS, and DXS304--had recombination fractions of 4% or less with FRAXA. The closest locus, DXS296, was distal to FRAXA and had a recombination fraction of 2%. The polymorphisms at these loci can be detected in DNA enzymatically digested with a limited number of restriction endonucleases. A strategy for DNA studies which is based on three restriction endonucleases and on five probes will detect one or more of these polymorphisms in 94% of women. This strategy greatly increases the utility of DNA studies in providing genetic advice to families with the fragile X syndrome.\r"

Linkage analysis has assigned EDMD to the terminal region of the human X chromosome long arm. We report here further linkage analysis in two multigenerational EDMD families using seven Xq28 marker loci. Cumulative lod scores suggest that EDMD is approximately 2 cM from DXS52 (lod = 15.67) and very close to the factor VIII (F8C) and the red/green color pigment (R/GCP) loci, with respective lod scores of 9.62 and 10.77, without a single recombinant. Several recombinations between EDMD and three proximal Xq28 markers suggest that the EDMD gene is located in distal Xq28. Multipoint linkage analysis indicates that the odds are 2,000:1 that EDMD lies distal to DXS305. These data substantially refine the ability to perform accurate carrier detection, prenatal diagnosis, and the presymptomatic diagnosis of at-risk males for EDMD by linkage analysis. The positioning of the EDMD locus close to the loci for F8C and R/GCP will assist in future efforts to identify and isolate the disease gene.\r"

Electron microscopy of a liver section showed many enlarged mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions. Decreased oxidation of the respiratory substrates-alanine and succinate-in skin fibroblasts suggested a deficiency of complex III of the electron-transport chain; cytochrome c oxidase activity (complex IV) was in the normal range. Biochemical analysis of liver supported the fibroblast data, since succinate oxidase activity (electron-transport activity through complexes II-IV) was reduced, whereas complex IV activity was normal. Furthermore, analysis of the cytochrome spectrum in liver revealed typical peaks for cytochromes cc1 and aa3, whereas cytochrome b (a component of complex III) was undetectable.

The phenotype is accounted for by mutations affecting the integrity and/or synthesis of the precursor procollagen molecules of type III collagen. In this article, we report the elucidation of the molecular defect in an EDS IV patient whose type III collagen was previously found to be structurally abnormal. We utilized PCR in a two-step process involving first the localization of the mutation in the mRNA and then the characterization of the defect in the gene. The results established the patient's heterozygosity for a genomic deletion of about 7.5 kb which eliminates 1,026 nucleotides of coding sequences in the message. The mutation arose as a result of an exon-to-intron recombination. The deleted segment extends from the 13th nucleotide of exon 9 to within a DNA sequence of intron 24, which is composed of a series of dinucleotide repeats. Using PCR, we tested the polymorphic nature of this DNA element on several unrelated individuals. Analysis of amplified genomic products of 45 chromosomes recognized at least four distinct allelic forms that display frequencies ranging from 5% to 61%. Mendelian segregation of three of the four alleles was established by the same method in a 3-generation family.\r"

A 1,477-bp cDNA was sequenced and shown to code for FAH by an in vitro transcription-translation assay and sequence homology with tryptic fragments of purified FAH. Transient expression of this FAH cDNA in transfected CV-1 mammalian cells resulted in the synthesis of an immunoreactive protein comigrating with purified human liver FAH on SDS-PAGE and having enzymatic activity as shown by the hydrolysis of the natural substrate fumarylacetoacetate. This indicates that the single polypeptide chain encoded by the FAH gene contains all the genetic information required for functional activity, suggesting that the dimer found in vivo is a homodimer. The human FAH cDNA was used as a probe to determine the gene's chromosomal localization using somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization.

  ".W": "Severe methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency with less than 2% of normal enzyme activity is characterized by neurological abnormalities, atherosclerotic changes, and thromboembolism. We have discovered a \"new\" variant of MTHFR deficiency which is characterized by the absence of neurological abnormalities, an enzyme activity of about 50% of the normal value, and distinctive thermolability under specific conditions of heat inactivation. In this study, lymphocyte MTHFR specific activities in the thermolabile variant and control groups were 5.58 +/- 0.91 and 10.33 +/- 2.89 nmol formaldehyde formed/mg protein/h, respectively. The difference was significant (P less than .01). However, there was overlap among the individual values from the two groups. On the other hand, residual MTHFR activity after heat inactivation was 11.2 +/- 1.43% in the thermolabile variant and 36.3 +/- 5.18% in the controls. There was no overlap. Enzyme studies in 10 subjects with thermolabile MTHFR and their family members support the hypothesis that thermolabile MTHFR is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. To elucidate the association of thermolabile MTHFR with the development of coronary artery disease, we determined the thermostability of lymphocyte MTHFR in 212 patients with proven coronary artery disease and in 202 controls without clinical evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Thermolabile MTHFR was found in 36 (17.0%) cardiac patients and 10 (5.0%) controls. The difference in incidence between the two groups was statistically significant (P less than .01). The average age at onset of clinical coronary artery disease in 36 patients with thermolabile MTHFR was 57.3 +/- 7.6 years (35-72 years). The mean total plasma homocysteine concentration in patients with thermolabile MTHFR was 13.19 +/- 5.32 nmol/ml and was significantly different from the normal mean of 8.50 +/- 2.80 nmol/ml (P less than .05). There was no association between thermolabile MTHFR and other major risk factors. We conclude that thermolabile MTHFR is a variant(s) of MTHFR deficiency which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In addition, it is positively associated with the development of coronary artery disease. Determination of in vitro thermostability of lymphocyte MTHFR is a reliable method for identifying subjects with this abnormality.\r"

All four subjects had less than 25% of normal mean MTHFR specific activity in lymphocyte extracts. Three of them with normal serum folate and cyanocobalamin had intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia, and one with high serum folate and cyanocobalamin had no excessive accumulation of serum homocysteine. The biochemical features in these four subjects are distinguishable from subjects homozygous for the thermolabile MTHFR, whose specific activity is approximately 50% of the normal mean, and from heterozygotes for severe MTHFR deficiency, in whom the enzyme is thermostable and has a specific activity of about 50% of the normal mean. We propose that these four subjects are genetic compounds of the allele for the severe mutation and the allele for thermolabile mutation of the MTHFR gene. It is postulated that subjects with this genetic compound are more susceptible to the development of intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia despite normal folate and B12 levels. Nonetheless, hyperhomocysteinemia due to this compound heterozygosity is correctable by oral folic acid therapy.\r"

  ".W": "An accurate diagnosis of heterozygotes for autosomal recessive disorders with unknown mutations can be difficult. Using a unique phenomenon occurring in vivo, we designed a method for the diagnosis of heterozygotes for adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency which makes way for a qualitative distinction between normal and heterozygous subjects. We cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 2,6-diaminopurine, an APRT-dependent cytotoxin, to search for in vivo mutational cells. Fifteen putative heterozygotes examined were found to possess such mutant cells at rather high frequencies; thus, a false negative diagnosis is unlikely. The analysis of genomic DNA in 82 resistant clones from two of the heterozygotes clarified that 64 (78%) had lost the germinally intact alleles. Thirteen members of APRT-deficient families were examined; eight proved to be heterozygotes. Among 425 individuals from two separate residential areas of Japan, two heterozygotes were found. The authenticity of the heterozygosity was validated by two separate methods for the two heterozygotes; hence, a false positive diagnosis can be ruled out. Our data showed a calculated heterozygote frequency of 0.47% (95% confidence limits; 0.05%-1.7%), a value compatible with that (1.2%) calculated from data concerning the incidence of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis. This novel genetic approach for identifying heterozygotes is now being tested to search for other enzyme deficiencies in humans.\r"

These families had multiple cases of Alzheimer disease (AD) in 2 or more generations with family age-at-onset means (M) ranging from 41 to 83 years. Included in this group are seven Volga German families which are thought to be genetically homogeneous with respect to FAD. Autopsy documentation of AD was available for 32 families. Linkage to the 21 q11-q21 region was tested using D21S16, D21S13, D21S110, D21S1/S11, and the APP gene as genetic markers. When linkage results for all the families were summed, the LOD scores for these markers were consistently negative and the entire region was formally excluded. Linkage results were also summed for the following family groups; late-onset (M greater than 60), early-onset (M less than or equal to 60), Volga Germans (M = 56), and early-onset non-Volga Germans (M less than or equal to 60). For the first three groups, LOD scores were negative for this region. For the early-onset non-Volga German group (six families), small positive LOD scores of Zmax = 0.78 (recombination fraction theta = .15), Zmax = 0.27 (theta = .15), and Zmax = 0.64 (theta = .0), were observed for D21S13, D21S16, and D21S110, respectively. The remainder of the long arm of chromosome 21 was tested for linkage to FAD using seven markers spanning the q22 region. Results for these markers were also predominantly negative. Thus it is highly unlikely that a chromosome 21 gene is responsible for late-onset FAD and at least some forms of early-onset FAD represented by the Volga German kindreds.\r"

Our demonstration of cytogenetic or molecular deletions in 21 of 25 MDS probands proves that deletion of a \"critical region\" comprising two or more genetic loci within band 17p13.3 is the cause of the MDS phenotype. We suspect that the remaining patients have smaller deletions involving the proposed critical region which are not detected with currently available probes.\r"

In our program approximately 20% (36/183) of persons have been excluded from predictive testing because of this reason. The major aim of this study was to examine whether data derived from linkage disequilibrium could modify risk analysis for persons at risk for HD. As a first step, we assessed whether the previously reported linkage disequilibrium between alleles recognized by probe pBS674E-D at locus D4S95 remained significant in a much larger data set. A total of 1,150 chromosomes from 622 individuals--200 affected and 422 unaffected--from 118 families were assessed. Significant haplotype association was detected with AccI and MboI RFLPs at the locus D4S95, with all the families (P = .00003), as well as for a subset from the United Kingdom (P = .0037). Data derived from linkage disequilibrium studies using D4S95 modifies the risk for HD, especially in persons of U.K. descent. Utilization of this approach for risk modification of HD awaits both validation of these data and additional information concerning ethnic-specific alleles at the D4S95 locus.\r"

We believe that this is a disease-causing mutation, as it involves a nonconservative amino acid change and has only been found on CF chromosomes with a consistent haplotype background. The mutation was detected using direct sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA and was confirmed by dot hybridization to both normal and mutant allele-specific oligonucleotides. The mutation was detected on three chromosomes from four individuals but not on any normal chromosome.

By incorporation of a restriction enzyme site into the (CA)n primer, we have been able to subclone the genomic DNA so that the sequence flanking the CA repeat is readily determined. Primers can then be designed to amplify across the CA repeat in patient DNA samples. Application of this technique to genomic DNAs surrounding the upstream \"brain\" promoter of the dystrophin gene has led to the discovery of four new CA repeats. Three of these repeats are highly polymorphic, with PICs ranging from .586 to .768. The location of these markers at the extreme 5' terminus of the dystrophin gene, together with their high degree of polymorphism and ease of assay, makes them ideal for linkage analysis in families with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\r"

Population screening indicates that this mutation constitutes about 8% of all PKU chromosomes in Chinese but is absent in Japanese and Caucasian PKU patients.

Three mutations were identified. The first was shown to be a not previously described mutation: a G----A substitution at the 5' donor junction splice site of intron 7. The second change was a reported G----A mutation at codon 261. The third change corresponded to a polymorphism at codon 245.

In vitro teicoplanin had a higher intrinsic activity than vancomycin did; and it also had a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile, resulting in higher peak concentrations in plasma, a longer elimination half-life, and a larger area under the concentration-time curve than those of vancomycin. To predict the antibacterial efficacies of the drugs in vivo on the basis of their activities in vitro and pharmacokinetics, a mathematical model was applied. In the model the in vitro effect was expressed as the difference in growth rate between control cultures and those in the presence of the antibiotic (ER), and the in vivo effect was expressed as the difference between numbers of CFU in control and antibiotic-treated animals (EN). The integral of ER against time, ERt, was calculated by using the concentrations found in vivo. A significant linear relationship was found between EN and ERt for different dosages at the same times (4 h) after drug administration as well as for the same doses at consecutive times, although at the lowest doses of teicoplanin the observed effect was less than the predicted effect.\r"

Three resistance phenotypes could be distinguished. Thirty-one enterococci were highly resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Resistance was transferable to other enterococci by conjugation for 16 of the 22 isolates that were tested. Homology was detected by hybridization between a probe specific for the vanA gene, which encodes an inducible high-level glycopeptide resistance protein in Enterococcus faecium BM4147, and DNA of the 31 clinical isolates and the 16 corresponding transconjugants. This indicates that a single class of resistance determinants accounts for high-level glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. The strains differed in their biotypes and resistance phenotypes and harbored resistance plasmids of various sizes, suggesting that spread of this resistance phenotype is due to dissemination of a gene rather than of a bacterial clone or of a single plasmid. Four enterococcal isolates were resistant to low levels of vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin. Twenty-three coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates were resistant to teicoplanin and susceptible to vancomycin. These two groups of strains did not hybridize with the vanA probe and did not transfer resistance at a detectable frequency. The vanA gene was not detected in the glycopeptide-producing strains of Amycolatopsis orientalis (vancomycin) and Actinoplanes teichomyceticus (teicoplanin) or in various gram-positive bacteria intrinsically resistant to glycopeptides.\r"

One preinfusion and 15 postinfusion serum samples and total urine output were collected over one dosing interval between days 3 and 8 of therapy. Cefepime concentrations in serum over time exhibited a multicompartmental profile. Peak and trough concentrations in serum determined by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method were 71.2 +/- 17.2 (mean +/- standard deviation) and 6.0 +/- 4.9 mg/liter, respectively. The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.22 +/- 0.05 liter/kg. Elimination half-lives ranged from 1.93 to 6.04 h (3.92 +/- 1.28 h), and total body clearances ranged from 36.9 to 102 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (73.0 +/- 19.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2). The disposition of cefepime at steady state in patients was comparable to previous observations in healthy elderly volunteers. The predictive performance of regression equations derived from single-dose studies in volunteers relating creatinine clearance with total body and renal clearances of cefepime exhibited slight biases (mean predictive errors, -9.7 and 2.1 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) and similar precisions. Predicted and observed total body clearances (63.3 +/- 25.1 versus 73.0 +/- 19.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) and renal clearances (51.3 +/- 24.4 versus 49.3 +/- 19.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) were not significantly different. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in infected patients appeared to be unaltered by illness, and the steady-state disposition of cefepime was predictable from data derived from single-dose studies in volunteers.\r"

In contrast, in the resistant (MIC, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml) group (in which most of the strains did not contain PBP 5*), the degree of saturation of PBP 5 seemed to determine the physiological response to the antibiotic: low levels of saturation caused growth inhibition, whereas almost complete saturation correlated with lysis. The penicillin-induced cell lysis of both penicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains was attributed, at least in part, to the extensive loss of acylated lipoteichoic acid into the growth medium.\r"

A cluster of genes containing IS140, aacC4, and hphB was found in these strains.

One explanation for these clinical failures may relate to the relatively high degree of daptomycin protein binding (94%). To evaluate the impact of protein on daptomycin activity, a two-chamber in vitro pharmacodynamic model was used to study and compare the interaction between Staphylococcus aureus (clinical isolate) and either daptomycin or vancomycin, each in the presence and absence of physiologic human albumin concentrations. Low-dose (2 mg/kg) daptomycin, high-dose (6 mg/kg) daptomycin, and 10 mg of vancomycin per kg beta-phase elimination serum-concentration-versus-time curves were simulated by using this in vitro pharmacodynamic model. The bacterial kill rates by all three regimens were decreased in the presence of albumin (P less than 0.0002). The average times required for a 99% kill of the initial S. aureus inocula (approximately 5 x 10(7) CFU/ml) without albumin were 0.81 (low-dose daptomycin), 0.33 (high-dose daptomycin), and 6.18 (vancomycin) h. The average times required for a 99% kill of S. aureus with albumin were 7.66 (low-dose daptomycin), 0.95 (high-dose daptomycin), and 10.52 (vancomycin) h. These data demonstrate that, depending on the concentration of daptomycin, the presence of albumin can profoundly diminish the bactericidal activity of daptomycin.\r"

  ".W": "A thigh muscle infection induced with Escherichia coli in irradiated mice was used as a model to compare the in vivo pharmacodynamics of the antibacterial effect of four cephalosporins (i.e., cefepime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone) with the in vitro antibacterial pharmacodynamics of these drugs. The following in vitro pharmacodynamic parameters were determined: the maximum effect as a measure for efficacy, the 50% effective concentration as a parameter for potency, and the slope of the concentration-effect relationship. For analysis of the in vivo antibacterial pharmacodynamics, the same parameters were applied for the dose instead of the concentration. For the detection of a relationship between concentration and antibacterial effect in vivo, we determined the pharmacokinetics of the four cephalosporins in the plasma of mice. The results showed that, in general, there is a direct relationship between the in vivo and in vitro pharmacodynamics of these cephalosporins. The maximum effects of cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone were approximately similar in vivo and in vitro. The sequence of potency of these drugs was, in descending order, cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone. Ceftriaxone differed from the other three cephalosporins in that it displayed unexpected in vivo pharmacodynamics. Ceftriaxone was just as efficacious as the other three in vitro, but its maximum effect in vivo was much lower. This relatively low maximum effect of ceftriaxone in vivo was not explained by the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug. From the present results it can be concluded that the in vitro efficacy of cephalosporins does not necessarily have a predictive value for the in vivo efficacy.\r"

Earlier, we isolated, after mutagenesis, Escherichia coli DS1, which exhibited reduced killing by quinolones. We evaluated the killing of DS1 and several other strains by quinolones and beta-lactams. In time-killing studies with norfloxacin, DS1 was killed 1 to 2 log10 units compared to 4 to 5 log10 units for the wild-type parent strain KL16, thus revealing that DS1 is a high-persistence (hip) mutant. DS1 exhibited a similar high-persistence pattern for the beta-lactam ampicillin and reduced killing by drugs that differed in their affinities for penicillin-binding proteins, including cefoxitin, cefsulodin, imipenem, mecillinam, and piperacillin. Conjugation and P1 transduction studies identified a novel mutant locus (termed hipQ) in the 2-min region of the DS1 chromosome necessary for reduced killing by norfloxacin and ampicillin. E. coli KL500, which was isolated for reduced killing by norfloxacin without mutagenesis, exhibited reduced killing by ampicillin. E. coli HM23, a hipA (34 min) mutant that was isolated earlier for reduced killing by ampicillin, also exhibited high persistence to norfloxacin. DS1 differed from HM23, however, in the map location of its hip mutation, lack of cold sensitivity, and reduced killing by coumermycin. Results of these studies with strains DS1, KL500, and HM23 demonstrate overlap in the pathways of killing of E. coli by quinolones and beta-lactams and identify hipQ, a new mutant locus that is involved in a high-persistence pattern of reduced killing by norfloxacin and ampicillin.\r"

Each volunteer received single 0.5-, 1-, and 2-g doses of cefmetazole administered intravenously over 5 min according to a three-way crossover design. Serial plasma and urine samples were collected over a 24-h period following dosing and assayed for cefmetazole by a high-performance liquid chromatography method. Results of the dose proportionality portion of the study indicated that cefmetazole pharmacokinetics are linear and proportional with dose in both age groups. Comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters between the young and elderly groups indicated that the systemic clearance was significantly lower in elderly than in young volunteers (92.4 versus 112 ml/min). Additionally, creatinine clearance was significantly lower in elderly (74.1 ml/min) than in young (92.9 ml/min) subjects. No significant differences between age groups were observed for volume of distribution, urinary recovery, terminal half-life, nonrenal clearance, or renal clearance, although half-life was slightly prolonged in elderly volunteers relative to that in young volunteers (1.54 versus 1.34 h), and renal clearance was slightly lower in elderly than in young volunteers (83.7 versus 96.1 ml/min). Both systemic and renal clearance were significantly correlated with creatinine clearance. These results indicate that the observed age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of cefmetazole are most likely due to differences in renal function between the two age groups. The small reduction in cefmetazole elimination in the elderly would not warrant dose adjustment in this population.\r"

When the tetradecyl derivative was tested against some selected microorganisms, the killing effect was comparable to that of the stable quaternary ammonium compound cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. At higher pH values, both the antimicrobial effect and the rate of hydrolysis of the esters increased. However, whereas at pH 6 greater than 99.99% killing of Salmonella typhimurium was achieved with 5 micrograms/ml in 3 min, the rate of hydrolysis was less than 20% in 18 h. At pH 7, a similar killing effect was achieved in 2 min and 50% hydrolysis occurred in ca. 5 h. Thus, it is possible to exploit the rapid microbicidal effect of the compounds before they hydrolyze. The rate of hydrolysis was reduced by the presence of salt. The bactericidal effect of the betaine esters increased with the length of the hydrocarbon chain of the fatty alcohol moiety up to 18 carbon atoms. Since the hydrolysis products are normal human metabolites, the hydrolysis property may extend the use of these quaternary ammonium compounds as disinfectants and antiseptics for food and body surfaces.\r"

Gyrase was much more sensitive to quinolones than the other topoisomerases which can therefore be inhibited by moderate concentrations of certain quinolones. No good correlation was observed between the activity on gyrase and on the other enzymes, since the ratio varied from 15 to more than 8,500. On the contrary, there was a good correlation between early inhibition of DNA synthesis, inhibition of gyrase, and MICs.\r"

  ".W": "We have elucidated a new mechanism for bacterial resistance to the 14-membered macrolides oleandomycin and erythromycin and the 15-membered macrolide azithromycin. Plasmid pNE24, previously isolated from a clinical specimen of Staphylococcus epidermidis, was characterized as causing resistance to 14-membered but not 16-membered macrolides by a mechanism suggested to involve reduced antibiotic permeation of bacterial cells (B. C. Lampson, W. von David, and J. T. Parisi, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 30:653-658, 1986). Our recent investigations have demonstrated that S. epidermidis 958-2 containing plasmid pNE24 also contains an energy-dependent macrolide efflux pump which maintains intracellular antibiotic concentrations below those required for binding to ribosomes. Thus, when strain 958-2 was pretreated with the inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), macrolide accumulated at the same rate and to the same extent as in CCCP-treated or untreated control cells lacking plasmid pNE24 (strain 958-1). In contrast, macrolide did not accumulate in energy-competent strain 958-2 but did accumulate to levels equal to those of ribosomes immediately following CCCP addition. Furthermore, intracellular macrolide was excreted and bacteria resumed growth when CCCP but not macrolide was removed from the growth medium. As expected, the 16-membered macrolide niddamycin accumulated to the same level in energy-competent strains 958-1 and 958-2 at the same rapid rate. Macrolide incubated with lysates prepared from both strains or recovered from cells of strain 958-2 was unmodified and bound to ribosomes from strains 958-1 and 958-2 with identical affinities and kinetics, thus precluding a role for ribosome or drug alteration in the resistance mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Deletion of any component from the system markedly decreased the toxic effect on P. falciparum. This toxic effect was not inhibited by catalase.

The higher the molecular weight range of dextran sulfate, the more potent the activity as assessed by a quantitative syncytium formation assay. Although all five HIV isolates had similar susceptibilities to the inhibitory effects of dideoxynucleosides, the two clinical isolates of HIV (HIV type 1 [HIV-1] TM and SP) exhibited a pattern of reduced susceptibility to dextran sulfate when compared with the two cloned isolates (HIV-1 WMF and HIV-2 ROD) and a prototype laboratory strain (HIV-1 IIIB). In combination with dideoxynucleosides, the high-molecular-weight range of dextran sulfate (500,000) resulted in an antagonistic response directed against the two clinical isolates of HIV (HIV-1 TM and SP) when the antiviral concentrations of dextran sulfate were in the ineffective range. Additive or synergistic effects were seen with the other three HIV isolates and all five HIV isolates when the low-molecular-weight range of dextran sulfate (8,000) was used.

These strains were characterized biochemically, and the metabolism of fluorinated pyrimidines was studied by 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. No evidence was obtained from these studies for degradative metabolism of the fluorinated derivatives. In the parental susceptible strain of C. glabrata, 5-fluorouracil but not 5-FC was detected within the cells. 5-Fluorouracil was also present in the culture supernatant after incubation of the cells with 5-FC. The distribution of fluorinated derivatives within the 5-FC-resistant strains was consistent with their genotype. Two strains of C. glabrata which had only a partial loss of cytosine deaminase and UMP pyrophosphorylase activity had high levels of resistance to 5-FC. Both C. glabrata and Candida albicans were susceptible to 5-fluorouridine. This compound but not the anticancer drug 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine was shown to be transported into susceptible cells by a specific uridine permease.\r"

The highest rates of use were among male subjects aged 15 to 24 years. Excluding 47 subjects whose prescriptions were stopped because of noncompliance or who left the care of Group Health Cooperative physicians, 39 (8.4%) of the remaining 466 discontinued taking the drug because of the following adverse effects: mucous/skin/musculoskeletal effects (17); elevated triglyceride levels (eight); headaches (five); increased liver enzyme levels (three); amenorrhea (two); and other (four). One subject, excluded from the 466 because of noncompliance, became pregnant while using medication from a previous prescription and had a therapeutic abortion; she was not under the care of a physician at the time of pregnancy. Most subjects (97%) developed a mucocutaneous symptom, and 42% developed musculoskeletal symptoms. Moderate elevations in liver enzyme levels developed in six (1.8%) of 341 subjects with normal baseline values. Of 389 subjects with normal baseline triglyceride values (less than 2.25 mmol/L), nine (2.3%) developed moderate elevations (4.5 to 9.0 mmol/L), and one (0.3%) developed a severe elevation (greater than or equal to 9.0 mmol/L). Of 24 subjects with elevated baseline triglyceride levels, three (12.5%) developed moderate elevations. Of an additional 53 subjects whose baseline serum triglyceride levels were not determined, two developed elevations during therapy, one up to 13.4 mmol/L. Subjects who were overweight or had elevated baseline serum triglyceride values had an increased risk of developing elevations in triglyceride levels during therapy (odds ratio, 6.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 22.0; and odds ratio, 4.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 20.2, respectively).

After 12.8 years of prospective study, we documented the pregnancy outcomes among 1380 patients (892 men and 488 women) who received PUVA treatments. Ninety-four men reported 167 pregnancies in their partners, and 93 women reported 159 pregnancies. For 34% of pregnancies among partners of male patients, the man received PUVA therapy near the time of conception. Nineteen percent of female patients reported exposure to PUVA at the time of conception or during pregnancy. Induced and spontaneous abortions were reported as the outcome of pregnancy more often by female than by male patients (12% vs 30%). Two congenital malformations and two stillbirths occurred, an incidence not significantly different from that expected for the general population. Although the power of our study to detect an increase in the risk of specific defects is limited, our data show no evidence to suggest that PUVA is a potent teratogen. Still, because PUVA is mutagenic, we believe it prudent for patients to avoid PUVA treatment during pregnancy whenever practical.\r"

Diffuse spectral transmittance of various thicknesses of opaque sunscreen formulations were measured from 350- to 800-nm range using a spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Transmission through 20% zinc oxide paste was high and decreased minimally despite large increases in the sunscreen layer thickness. Adding a visible light absorber such as iron oxide to scattering sunscreens, however, substantially lowered transmittance below that predicted by the product of the transmittances for each component alone. Opaque sunscreens protected against hematoporphyrin derivative photosensitization of albino guinea pig skin; these results were quantitatively consistent with the in vitro findings. Poor photoprotection against visible light is obtained with white paste sunscreens, even if thick layers are applied. The addition of pigments to such sunscreens, however, greatly enhances photoprotection and cosmetic acceptability.\r"

The results indicate that a large proportion of the sample (11.9%, n = 156) had observed signs of melanoma in the previous 12 months. Of the sample reporting signs that had first appeared in the previous 5 years, only 32% sought medical advice about the signs within the recommended period. Of the sample either not seeking advice at all or delaying, 49% reported that they thought the sign \"wasn't serious/would clear up.\" Furthermore, 30% of the sample either did not known or underrated the importance of early detection and treatment of lesions.

Ultrastructurally, the basal cells were lacking in cytoplasmic tonofilaments, and the initial change of the cytolysis seemed to be cleavages of the cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, a basal cell keratin was expressed in a suprabasal cell layer but not in the basal cell layer, and a panepithelial keratin was not detected in the basal cell layer. These findings suggest that keratin production of the epidermal cells may be delayed, resulting in a weakness of the basal cells against minor trauma to the skin.\r"

Histologic examination of a lesion skin biopsy specimen demonstrated a subepidermal blister. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy revealed linear deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 located on both the roof and the floor of the blister. Immunofluorescence antigen mapping using cryostat sections of a spontaneous blister and antisera against defined basement membrane components localized the bullous pemphigoid antigen and type IV collagen in the roof of the blister. This dermal type of blister formation was confirmed by electron microscopy, which showed the cleavage level below the lamina densa. In direct immunoelectron microscopy, granular deposits of C3 and IgG were found attached to and just beneath the lamina densa in a pattern identical to the distribution of anchoring fibrils. These findings are diagnostic of acquired epidermolysis bullosa, a blistering disease that has much more clinical heterogeneity than previously suggested.\r"

The beneficial effect of somatostatin in the treatment of certain hypersecretory disorders of hormone excess in well recognized; however its clinical usefulness has been limited in the past by its extremely short plasma half-life. The development of long-acting somatostatin analogues has provided clinically useful agents for treatment of hormone-producing tumors. In addition to well-known inhibiting effects on hormone release and actions, recent studies using experimental tumor models have demonstrated an antiproliferative effect of somatostatin and its analogues on growth of a variety of neoplasms. The exact role of somatostatin analogues in cancer therapy has yet to be established; however studies suggest that these agents could provide a useful and relatively nontoxic adjuvant therapy in the treatment of certain tumors. In this review, the oncologic application of somatostatin and possible mechanism of action are examined and current clinical and experimental studies are summarized.\r"

Rapid progress in the surgical technique of OLTX in the last few years has demonstrated that most patients with portal vein thrombosis can be safely and successfully transplanted. Presented here is a series of 34 patients with portal vein thrombosis transplanted at the University of Pittsburgh since 1984. The various techniques used to treat various forms of thrombosis are described. The survival rate for this series was 67.6% (23 of 34 patients). Survival was best for patients who underwent phlebothrombectomy or placement of a jump graft from the superior mesenteric vein. The survival rate also correlated with the amount of blood required for transfusion during surgery. Overall it is concluded that a vast majority of the patients with thrombosis of the portal system can be technically transplanted and that their survival rate is comparable to that of patients with patent portal vein.\r"

There were 26 separate episodes of severe hemorrhage: 17 patients bled only once, three bled twice and one bled three times. The frequency of bleeding was significantly higher among patients with colonic involvement (17 of 929; 1.9%) than among those with small bowel disease alone (4 of 597; 0.7%) (p less than 0.001). Twelve patients required surgery on 13 occasions, which involved colon resection in all but one case. Eleven of these patients underwent surgery during their first hemorrhagic episodes, and 1 of 11 had a second operation for recurrent bleeding; the 12th patient, whose first hemorrhage had been treated medically, had surgery during a repeated episode of hemorrhage. The precise bleeding points could be located in only 2 of the 26 bleeding episodes, both at the ileocecal area. Three patients died, of whom two had not undergone surgery when they had bled a few weeks earlier. Primary bleeding episodes subsided without surgery in 10 of 21 cases, but 3 of these 10 patients (30%) rebled massively. By contrast primary excisional surgery was followed by recurrent hemorrhage in only 1 of 11 cases (9%). These differences in mortality and in recurrent bleeding rates, although not statistically significant, seem to favor removal of diseased bowel at the time of the first episode of massive hemorrhage.\r"

Six hundred consecutive children who were examined with computed tomography (CT) following blunt trauma were enrolled. Complete data sets were available on 375 children. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictor variables for the presence of abdominal injury. There were 174 children with abdominal injury detected by CT. Of these, 95 were classified as having significant injury. Indicators associated with significantly higher risk of abdominal injury included the following: more than three clinical indications given (odds likelihood ratio [OLR] = 4.60, 95% confidence interval [95% Cl] = 2.29, 9.21, p less than 0.001); gross hematuria (OLR = 5.80, 95% Cl = 2.51, 13.4, p less than 0.001); lap belt injury (OLR = 12.2, 95% Cl = 2.22, 66.8, p less than 0.01); assault or abuse as the mechanism of injury (OLR = 5.08, 95% Cl = 1.07, 24.2, p less than 0.05); abdominal tenderness (OLR = 2.73, 95% Cl = 1.296, 5.82, p less than 0.01); and Trauma Score less than or equal to 12 (OLR = 2.27, 95% Cl = 1.006, 5.13, p less than 0.01). No child with asymptomatic hematuria (n = 56), regardless of grade or neurologic impairment in the absence of abdominal findings (n = 15), had an abnormal CT examination. These data are useful as an adjunct to clinical judgment in triage when the availability of CT equipment is limited or there are competing extra-abdominal injuries.\r"

The results of adjuvant hepatic arterial chemotherapy using 0.4 mg/kg of doxorubicin and 0.12 mg/kg of mitomycin C and infusion of 5-fluorouracil were reported. One hundred sixty patients who had undergone hepatectomy for hepatoma were studied. In the operative findings of hepatoma, with a surgical margin of less than 10 mm, intrahepatic metastasis, tumor embolus in the second or more proximal branch of the portal vein, or lack of capsule formation related to the prognosis were the risk factors for recurrence. In 132 patients with these risk factors the survival rate of 19 patients with adjuvant arterial chemotherapy was significantly higher than for the 113 patients without it. Adjuvant hepatic arterial chemotherapy thus may be an effective therapy and should be studied prospectively in patients undergoing hepatectomy for high-risk hepatoma.\r"

Their ages at operation ranged from 18 to 153 days (mean, 59 days). After dissecting the porta hepatis structures by Kasai operation, a biliointestinal anastomosis was constructed with a valved hepatic portoduodenal intestinal conduit in all cases. The intestinal valve is an intussuscepted muscular valve. Valvular function was examined radiologically. The upper gastrointestinal series demonstrated no reflux of contrast material into the conduit proximal to the valve and liver scintigraphy demonstrated that radioactive isotope drained readily into the duodenum through the valve. Thirty-nine of the forty-six patients (85%) had bile drainage after initial operation. At present 30 patients (65%) are alive without jaundice, 6 (13%) are alive with jaundice, and 10 (22%) are dead. The 5-year jaundice-free survival rate was 64%. Cholangitis occurred in 9 of 39 patients (23%) who had obtained apparent bile drainage: 5 had tractable cholangitis and 4 had refractory cholangitis. Reoperation restored bile flow in 2 of 8 patients who abruptly ceased to have bile drainage without cholangitis. In conclusion, with a valved hepatic portoduodenal intestinal conduit, the incidence of cholangitis was decreased, its medical control became easier, and the survival rate was improved.\r"

Three hundred seven patients (56%) had upper-third lesions (proximal carcinoma), whereas 71 (13%) and 101 (18%), respectively, had middle-third and lower-third bile duct carcinomas. The remaining patients had diffuse lesions. Resectability rates were 32% for upper-third localization compared to 47% and 51% for middle-third and lower-third localization, respectively. The operative mortality rate for proximal carcinomas was significantly lower with resection (16%) compared with palliative surgery (31%) (p less than 0.05). Overall 1-year survival (operative deaths excluded) was 68% after tumor resection compared to 31% after palliative surgery (p less than 0.001). Long-term results after surgical resection correlated with local and regional extension of the disease. The results of this study show that resection of extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas, particularly in an upper-third localization, often is associated with worthwhile long-term survival.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-two patients with colon cancer were treated by primary subtotal colectomy, including 23 patients with acute and subacute left colon obstruction. There were two operative deaths and no cases of disabling diarrhea. One death occurred in the group with colon obstruction. Other indications for subtotal colectomy included multiple polyps associated with the primary tumor (32), synchronous carcinomas (15), a previous transverse colostomy for obstruction (8), associated severe sigmoid diverticular disease (2), age less than 50 years with a positive family history (3), adherence of the sigmoid loop to a cecal tumor (2), and metachronous carcinoma (2). There were multiple indications in several patients. Subtotal colectomy has a defined role in a wide variety of clinical settings associated with colon cancer, including management of obstruction of the left and sigmoid colon, particularly if the proximal colon cannot be evaluated before operation by colonoscopy or barium enema. Segmental or regional colonic resections are appropriate if the entire colon can be evaluated before operation and no associated neoplasms are revealed.\r"

  ".W": "Intraperitoneal (IP) abscesses frequently are composed of aerobes and anaerobes, and, in experimental models, a particulate adjuvant. The environmental changes effected by these components, either singularly or in combination, have not been well defined. The IP pO2, pH, and recoverable bacteria from the peritoneum of rats were quantified over 6 hours during simple aerobic and anaerobic infections and during mixed peritonitis with and without a sterile feces-barium sulfate adjuvant (SFA). Fourteen groups were studied, receiving intraperitoneally, at time of oxygen probe placement, 1 mL normal saline (control), Escherichia coli (EC), Bacteroides fragilis (BF), SFA alone, or a mixture of EC and BF, EC and SFA, BF and SFA, or EC, BF, and SFA. Control animals exhibited a stable IP pO2 and pH during 6 hours. In monomicrobial EC peritonitis, inocula well below the LD50 produced an increased IP pO2 and reduced arterial-peritoneal gradient (APG), with a stable IP pH. By 6 hours lethal doses of EC produced a dramatic decline in IP pO2, with no change in arterial pO2 as well as acidic IP and arterial pHs. Simple BF peritonitis caused no or minor elevations in IP and arterial pO2 with no change in pH. During mixed infections a significant decline in the IP pO2 and pH at 6 hours in those groups infected with both SFA and EC of a moderate, normally sublethal inoculation was observed, while arterial pO2 was unchanged and arterial pH was decreased only slightly. Concomitantly there was a significant increased number of aerobic bacteria in those groups with SFA as adjuvant compared to similar inocula without SFA. This study demonstrates the complex interactions of bacteria, sterile particulate adjuvant (SFA), and the host peritoneum. It suggests that the combination of SFA and aerobic bacteria alter the peritoneal environment to one permitting anaerobic growth and promoting abscess formation.\r"

In septic patients elevated plasma concentrations of endothelin-1 were inversely correlated with cardiac index (r = -0.80, p less than 0.005) and positively correlated the severity of illness as documented by APACHE II score (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01) and plasma creatinine levels (r = 0.80, p less than 0.005). No such correlations were found in postoperative cardiac patients.

To study this C3H/HeN mice were bled to mean blood pressure of 35 mmHg for 60 minutes, resuscitated, and treated with either ibuprofen (1.0 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline). Hemorrhage increased plasma prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels by 151.7% +/- 40.0% (p less than 0.05) and significantly decreased peritoneal macrophage (pM phi) antigen presentation (AP) by 60.5% +/- 7.3%, Ia expression by 52.3% +/- 7.6%, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) synthesis by 60.5% +/- 12.3% compared to shams. However ibuprofen treatment reduced PGE2 plasma levels by 61.3% +/- 12.1% and significantly increased AP (+237.0% +/- 95.3%), Ia expression (+72.8% +/- 27.5%), IL-1 synthesis (+235.7% +/- 134.7%), and cachectin synthesis (+485.8% +/- 209.0%) compared to vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that prostaglandins but not cachectin are involved in the suppression of pM phi functions following hemorrhage because blockade of prostaglandin synthesis improved depressed macrophage functions despite enhanced cachectin synthesis.\r"

This study determined recurrence and complication rates of unilateral versus simultaneous bilateral repair. Of 659 patients undergoing hernia repair between 1974 and 1980, 333 underwent unilateral repair and 329 had simultaneous bilateral repair. More than 90% of patients were followed until death or a minimum of 60 months (median, 104 months). Perioperative complications were associated with 18% of repairs. More morbidity occurred in the bilateral group. However complication rates for specific events were not significantly different, except for urinary retention, which occurred in 20 patients (6.1%) of the unilateral group and 49 (15%) of the bilateral group (p less than 0.001). Overall 25 recurrences occurred in the unilateral group and 31 in the bilateral group. Recurrence rates at 5 and 9 years were, respectively, 4.8% and 8.8% in the unilateral group and 5.0% and 9.1% in the bilateral group (p = 0.861). These data suggest that simultaneous bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy does not result in increased rates of most postoperative complications or recurrence when compared with unilateral repair.\r"

Isolated rat hearts were used with an oxygenated modified Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer as perfusion medium. The hearts were arrested for 20 minutes at 37 degrees C or 90 minutes at 24 degrees C. Treatment groups received one dose of nine possible cardioplegic solutions containing magnesium (0, 1.2, or 15 mmol/L) and calcium (0.05, 1.5, or 4.5 mmol/L). Ninety-six percent of the 75 magnesium-treated hearts recovered, regardless of the calcium concentration, in contrast to a 52% recovery rate in the 69 hearts that did not receive magnesium. The addition of 15 mmol/L Mg2+ to a cardioplegic solution containing no magnesium but 0.05 mmol/L Ca2+ significantly increased (p less than 0.01) the percent recovery of the following parameters of cardiac function: systolic pressure, 74% to 93% (37 degrees C), 64% to 98% (24 degrees C); cardiac output, 76% to 101% (37 degrees C), 71% to 102% (24 degrees C); stroke work, 64% to 104% (37 degrees C), 52% to 99% (24 degrees C); and adenosine triphosphate level, 75% to 83% (37 degrees C), 58% to 90% (24 degrees C). There were significant reductions (p less than 0.03) in percent recovery (37 degrees C and 24 degrees C) of cardiac output, stroke work, and adenosine triphosphate level in the groups that contained 0 or 15 mmol/L Mg2+ as the calcium concentration was increased from 0.05 to 4.5 mmol/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-four consecutive patients (65 men and 69 women) underwent pulmonary resection for bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Mean age was 65 years. Lobectomy was done in 100 patients, pneumonectomy in 10, segmentectomy in 5, and wedge excision in 19. Only 10 patients had lymph node metastases (7.5%). The neoplasm was solitary in 111 patients (82.8%); 97 were in stage I, 4 were in stage II, 9 were in stage IIIa, and 1 was in stage IIIb. There were two operative deaths (1.5%). Thirty-nine complications occurred in 31 patients. Median follow-up was 5.1 years. Recurrent bronchoalveolar carcinoma developed in 45 patients. Five- and 10-year survival for patients in stage I was 75.2% and 62.0%, respectively. Survival for patients with T1 N0 M0 neoplasms was identical to expected survival and was 90.5% at 5 years, as compared with 55.4% for patients with T2 N0 M0 disease, only 35.9% for patients with multiple bilateral disease, and 0.0% for patients with bilateral disease (p less than 0.0001). Other significant factors adversely affecting survival included the presence of signs and symptoms, diffuse malignant invasion, mucin-producing tumors, and the histological absence of scar. We conclude that bronchoalveolar carcinoma has a unique natural history that is more influenced by local neoplastic processes than by lymph node metastases. Early aggressive pulmonary resection is safe and offers the potential for cure. The presence of bilateral cancer, however, is ominous.\r"

We divided these patients into two groups. Group 1 was seen before 1970 and group 2 was seen from January 1970 to April 1989. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of malignancy in group 2 (47.2% versus 17.1%; p less than 0.0001) due to an increase in the number of lymphomas (22.6% versus 3.5%; p less than 0.001) and malignant neurogenic tumors (6.8% versus 1.1%; p = 0.0528). There was a significant increase in the number of malignant tumors in the anterior (59.5% versus 30.9%; p = 0.0022) and paravertebral (28.5% versus 2.8%; p = 0.0027) compartments in group 2. More patients with these tumors were symptomatic in group 2 (63.6% versus 5%; p = 0.0422). There was an increase of ancillary diagnostic studies performed to evaluate these tumors (76.0% versus 34.5%; p = 0.0422).

The surgical approach to these tumors included more median sternotomy (30.1% versus 10.7%; p = 0.0008), anterior mediastinotomy, and cervical mediastinoscopy in group 2 (1.1% versus 17.5%; p = 0.0002).

To help establish guidelines, we performed a retrospective analysis of 188 patients who underwent PFNA biopsy for suspected intrathoracic malignancy. Biopsy led to a diagnosis in 72% (135/188) of the patients, but in 27% (50/188) samples were inadequate for cytological diagnosis, and in 2% (3/188) samples were adequate but failed to yield a diagnosis. Fifty-three patients underwent surgical intervention, thus allowing histological confirmation of the cytological diagnosis. In patients with a diagnosis from PFNA biopsy, operation confirmed malignancy in 97% (37/38) and a specific cell type in 79% (30/38). In patients without a diagnosis after biopsy, a malignancy was found in 73% (11/15) at the time of operation. This suggests a high rate of accuracy when PFNA biopsy provides a diagnosis. However, it also illustrates that a substantial percentage of PFNA biopsy attempts fail to yield a diagnosis in patients ultimately found to have malignancies. This implies that PFNA biopsy might best be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates.\r"

There were four hospital deaths not related to the shunts. The remaining 35 patients were followed up for 1.6 months to 6.3 years (mean, 24.7 +/- 18 months). Repeat cineangiocardiographic studies revealed stenosis or distortion of the pulmonary arteries related to the site of the shunt in 11/22 patients (50%) with PTFE shunts and in 1/6 (17%) with classic Blalock-Taussig shunts; the stenosis was severe in only 1 patient. Mean increase in the pulmonary arterial index in the group with classic Blalock-Taussig shunts was 117 +/- 52 mm2/m2 (not significant) and in the group with PTFE shunts, 158 +/- 21 mm2/m2 (p less than 0.001).

In 20 adult pigs, the second and third diagonal branches were occluded with a snare for 1 1/2 hours. Animals were then placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and underwent 30 minutes of ischemic arrest with multidose, potassium, crystalloid cardioplegia. In 10 animals, the cardioplegia was given antegrade through the aortic root, whereas in 10 others, it was given retrograde through the coronary sinus. After the arrest period, the coronary snares were released and all hearts were reperfused for 3 hours. Postischemic damage in the myocardium beyond the occlusions was assessed by wall motion scores using two-dimensional echocardiography (4 = normal to -1 = dyskinesia), the change in myocardial pH from preischemia, and the area of necrosis/area of risk (histochemical staining). Hearts protected with retrograde coronary sinus cardioplegia had less tissue acidosis (change in pH = 0.08 +/- 0.03 versus 0.41 +/- 0.13; p less than 0.05), higher wall motion scores (2.0 +/- 0.6 versus 1.3 +/- 0.3; not significant), and less myocardial necrosis (43.4% +/- 3.6% versus 73.3% +/- 3.5%; p less than 0.0001). We conclude that retrograde coronary sinus cardioplegia provides more optimal myocardial protection than is possible with antegrade cardioplegia after revascularization of an acute coronary occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial areas distal to complete coronary artery occlusions are poorly protected by antegrade cardioplegia. We assessed the effects of coronary sinus cardioplegia in 30 patients undergoing bypass operations and at high risk of cardioplegic maldistribution because of the following anatomical patterns of coronary artery disease: critical (greater than or equal to 50%) stenosis of the left main trunk with total occlusion of the right coronary artery (16 patients) or critical (greater than or equal to 70%) stenosis of the right coronary artery with total occlusion of the left anterior descending (11 patients) or circumflex artery (3 patients). After induction of arrest through the aorta, coronary sinus cardioplegia was given intermittently during the cross-clamp period at a flow rate of 100 mL/min. Intraoperatively, occluded arteries were consistently found to be filled with the retrogradely infused solution. One patient died early postoperatively of low cardiac output and a second patient died later during his hospital stay, presumably of an arrhythmia. At autopsy, none of them had pathological evidence of inadequate myocardial protection. One patient sustained a myocardial infarction and 3 others required inotropes for more than 24 hours postoperatively. Postoperative values for right and left stroke volume indices were not significantly different from prebypass levels. Overall, these results are consistent with the occurrence of limited intraoperative ischemic damage and, by inference, suggest the efficacy of the coronary sinus route in preserving myocardial areas supplied by completely occluded coronary arteries and, hence, in jeopardy of inadequate cardioplegia delivery.\r"

The indication for operation was left ventricular outflow obstruction in 16 patients (47%), aortic regurgitation in 14 (41%), mixed aortic valve disease in 3 (9%), and failure of a previously implanted aortic homograft in 1 (3%). There were four early deaths, all before 1971, giving a hospital mortality of 11.8% (70% confidence interval, 6% to 20%). Surviving patients have been followed up a cumulative total of 214 patient-years, the longest period of observation being 16 years 8 months. Late mortality was 13.3% (70% confidence interval, 7% to 23%), and 4 other patients required removal of the pulmonary autograft for endocarditis. Actuarial rates at 16 years were 74% +/- 11% for freedom from reoperation on the left ventricular outflow tract, 80% +/- 10% for freedom from reoperation on the right ventricular outflow tract, and 77% +/- 10% for late survival. There was no instance of primary structural degeneration in the pulmonary autograft, and all surviving patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I without medication. This experience demonstrates that the pulmonary autograft can achieve good early and medium-term results in young patients. Should growth potential be realized, it might constitute the ideal biological valve for the left ventricular outflow in children.\r"

This group of patients was analyzed to evaluate the outcome of those in whom the aortic valve was preserved compared with those having valve replacement. The overall preoperative characteristics of the two groups were similar except for the incidence of Marfan's syndrome. Valve replacement was the elected procedure in patients with valve degeneration or annuloaortic ectasia. In patients with leaflet prolapse with or without an enlarged annulus, a plastic procedure was used. In 48% of the patients, it was possible to preserve the valve. There were five hospital deaths (11%): three were due to low-output syndrome, one was due to bleeding, and one was due to neurological complications. There were two late deaths (5%). Follow-up of the 37 surviving patients ranged from 2 to 108 months (mean follow-up, 18 months). Seventy-eight percent of the survivors were in functional class I and the others were in class II. Two patients in whom the aortic valve was preserved had mild aortic insufficiency. Three patients with bioprostheses underwent reoperation because of prosthetic valve dysfunction. One patient who had aortoplasty and an aortic valve plastic procedure was seen with redissection and aortic insufficiency after 60 months and was reoperated on using the Bentall technique. The actuarial survival curves showed that patients who underwent valvoplasty had higher, but not significantly higher, survival rates than the valve replacement patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Between November 1985 and July 1989, 18 patients 65 years of age or older (mean age, 71 years; range, 65 to 82 years) were treated after cardiotomy with a centrifugal vortex or pneumatic mechanical ventricular assist device. This group comprised 1.9% of the 926 patients 65 years of age or older undergoing cardiac surgical procedures and 69% of the 26 patients requiring postcardiotomy support during this interval. Before institution of mechanical support, all patients were receiving maximal inotropic support and 16 patients had intraaortic balloon pumps inserted. Univentricular support was used in 9 patients (6 left, 3 right) and biventricular support in 9 patients. The mean duration of support was 45 hours (range, 8 to 118 hours). Twelve patients (67%) were successfully weaned, 8 (44%) were discharged from the hospital, and 6 (33%) remain alive 11 to 31 months postoperatively. Four of the 6 survivors are in New York Heart Association class I, 1 is in class II, and 1 is in class IV. The Combined Registry for ventricular assist device support has recently reported an overall survival rate of 12% in patients 65 to 70 years of age and 6% in those older than 70 years. Our results are comparable with those reported for younger patients and justify the use of postcardiotomy ventricular assist device support in the elderly.\r"

To determine the effect of recent changes in operative techniques and in the patient population itself on early mortality, we reevaluated the surgical outcome in this special group of patients. We reviewed the charts of 88 consecutive Jehovah's Witness patients who had an open heart operation between January 1986 and March 1989 and compared demographic variables in this group with those of 575 patients who underwent operation between May 1963 and January 1986. In our recent series, patients were older (mean age, 61 years versus 54 years), and 16% were seen for repeat procedures. Early mortality (less than or equal to 30 days postoperatively) was lower in the recent series than in the earlier series (7.0% versus 10.7%), but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. We identified several important factors associated with an increased risk of early death in the recent group of patients. These factors included repeat cardiac operations (p less than 0.01), especially for valvar dysfunction, severe left ventricular dysfunction (defined as an ejection fraction less than 0.35) (p less than 0.01), and a hemoglobin level lower than 80 g/L (8 g/dL) (p less than 0.01) on postoperative day 1. Although blood loss remains the leading cause of death in these patients, cardiac operations can be performed with an acceptable mortality.\r"

No significant changes occurred when the catheter was advanced into the wedged position without balloon inflation. Balloon inflation had no significant effect on these variables before bacterial infusion. We conclude that with sufficiently severe pulmonary hypertension in association with diffuse lung injury, lobar pulmonary artery occlusion may cause alterations in cardiac output and left atrial pressure. This may confuse interpretation of pulmonary artery catheter measurements.\r"

Overall, complete resolution was obtained by this technique alone in 60% (18/30). Of the 12 patients in whom complete resolution was not obtained, secondary surgical measures resulted in resolution of empyema in 8. Four patients died; all were elderly and severely debilitated, 3 with advanced malignancy. Their deaths were not related to the technique, which was well tolerated in all cases. Thoracoscopic debridement and irrigation used routinely as a first-line measure in empyema thoracis is a safe and relatively atraumatic procedure, does not exclude the use of any subsequent surgical measure, and provides valuable time to improve the condition of debilitated patients so that they may tolerate more aggressive surgical procedures.\r"

A total of 63 fistulas in 62 patients have been described. The case we present is unusual in the use of serratus anterior muscle for repair of the fistula. Eighty-seven percent of the cases documented in the literature were associated with an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. Eighty-six percent of the fistulas were between the descending aorta and left bronchopulmonary tree. More than 95% of patients experienced at least a single episode of hemoptysis, and massive hemoptysis occurred in more than half of the reported cases. A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only 54% of cases. Plain chest radiographs definitively demonstrated an aneurysm in only 16%. The computed tomographic scan was the most rewarding test, identifying an aneurysm in 11 of 12 patients and the fistula in 50% of them. Surgical repair resulted in a 76% survival rate.\r"

This pilot study was undertaken on 18 functionally impaired nursing home residents (age range 60 to 90 years) with markedly deteriorated muscle function (50%) secondary to age, disuse, and multiple chronic illnesses. Fourteen of the subjects completed the six-week program without adverse effects. In 75% of the patients, there was improved muscle function, with endurance, strength, and speed increasing 35%, 15%, and 10%, respectively. After the program, many subjects increased their spontaneous activity and decreased their dependency. The improvements were still evident four months after rehabilitation. These results suggest that it may be possible, through a carefully supervised, short-term program of muscle rehabilitation, for nursing home residents to achieve an enhanced level of physical functioning.\r"

The Cybex II isokinetic unit, timed gait, Ashworth scale, and subject's assessment of function were objective and subjective measures used to evaluate changes in hypertonicity. There was significant correlation between the Cybex and Ashworth as methods of measuring spasticity. Overall, treatment with baclofen alone significantly improved moderate quadriceps spasticity as measured by Cybex flexion scores. A trend, indicative of enhancing the beneficial effects of baclofen, was noted when stretching exercises were added to the treatment.\r"

Patients were evaluated using a subjective hip-rating scale and a gait-evaluation mat. Data were compared with those obtained from a control group of 91 patients. All patients showed a marked improvement in both subjective ratings and measured quantitative gait parameters. Patients with unilateral hip disease improved to a greater extent than those with bilateral disease after arthroplasty. We have concluded that total hip arthroplasty can greatly improve the gait characteristics of patients with degenerative arthritis, and that this improvement can be quantified, documented, and followed by using a system of gait evaluation.\r"

In the first two weeks after injury, in females and in males, there was no significant difference in mean hemoglobin level between SI and SCI patients. At six weeks, no male with SI was anemic, and males with SCI had significantly lower mean hemoglobin levels than those with SI (121.6 g/L vs 145.4 g/L, p less than .001). Identified early causes of anemia were blood loss due to bony soft tissue or visceral injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, and surgery. In the postacute phase (more than six weeks after injury), anemia occurred in 25 of 41 male and three of nine female SCI patients, and its occurrence was associated with the presence of an identified chronic disease, especially urinary tract infection.\r"

Clinical data were collected, and a questionnaire concerning both sexual behavior and feelings about sexuality was administered to the patients and their spouses. Twenty-four couples were eliminated from further analysis because of a discrepancy between husband and wife in the answers concerning sexual behavior after stroke. A marked decline in sexual activity after stroke was found in both genders; other aspects of sexual behavior underwent fewer changes. The feeling of an overall change in sexual life was reported more frequently by male patients. Most patients' spouses reported the feeling of an overall psychological change in their partners and the feeling of an overall change in sexual life after the onset of the illness. No significant associations were found between clinical features and changes in sexual life. This study confirms that cerebrovascular accidents are generally followed by some important alterations in sexual life. Clinical factors do not seem to play a crucial role in determining these changes, which may be better explained in terms of maladjustment attributable to psychologic and interpersonal factors.\r"

Forty-two limbs (50%) were totally asymptomatic one month after the operation and remained so for at least half a year postoperatively. In the follow-up examination, 31 limbs were still asymptomatic, whereas 11 limbs had the same symptoms as before the operation. Of the nine patients with recurrent TOS (two with bilateral resection), seven were women and two were men. These nine patients were on average 38 years old (range = 19 to 51 years) and their jobs consisted of monotonous desk work. Seven of 11 stumps of the first rib were subluxated disclosed by the cervical rotation-lateral-flexion test. The occurrence of a subluxated stump of the first rib in the group of asymptomatic patients was far lower, only 3% (p less than .001). Of the 42 patients with persistent problems, a subluxated stump was encountered in seven (17%). Results of this follow-up examination suggest that monotonous desk work is an important factor causing kinesiologic abnormalities in the thoracic aperture. This abnormal kinesiology contributes to the recurrence of TOS symptoms even after the resection of the first rib.\r"

Resting activity, motor unit action potential (MUAP) morphology, and MUAP recruitment were evaluated in every case. Medical records (excluding EMG data) were analyzed for clinical evidence of LMN or UMN dysfunction in the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and pharynx. The diagnosis of LMN dysfunction rested on clinical data consistent with cranial nerve injury, poliomyelitis, Wallenberg syndrome, or unilateral bulbar palsy. Criteria for UMN dysfunction included previous cerebral (not brainstem) infarction or mass lesion or the presence of hemiparesis. Electromyographic abnormalities were significantly associated with LMN dysfunction (p less than .05), but they were not significantly associated with UMN dysfunction. Of the parameters tested, MUAP recruitment was the most sensitive (82%) and specific (92%).\r"

In this review the literature is examined for evidence of neurobehavioral impairment due to carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproic acid. No comparative studies have been performed in the TBI population, making if difficult to determine if one of these medications is preferable. Direct inference from studies on epilepsy patients to TBI patients is hazardous due to underlying differences in the two populations. Reported findings for epilepsy patients are subtle and not consistent across studies. All three drugs appear to exert some effect on cognitive and motor functions in epileptic patients, and these impairments worsen at increasing serum levels. The varied length of experience with each drug makes it difficult to assign relative weight to the evidence for or against each. A comparative assessment of cognitive and behavioral effects of anticonvulsants should be done in the TBI population.\r"

We report the occurrence of an isolated lesion of the mandibular nerve associated with a unilateral mandibular fracture, and its substantiation electrophysiologically. A 65-year-old man was involved in a motor vehicle accident resulting in multiple fractures, including a unilateral mandibular fracture and temporomandibular joint dislocation. No evidence of intracranial pathology by CT scan was noted and the neurologic examination was nonfocal except for dysfunction of the mandibular nerve ipsilateral to the fracture site. Bilateral facial nerve latency and blink reflexes were normal. EMG evaluation of the muscles of facial expression and mastication demonstrated denervation confined to the muscles innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. In patients complaining of facial sensory dysfunction, malocclusion, or weakness of muscles of mastication after mandibular fracture, an electrophysiologic examination can assist in evaluating cranial nerve integrity.\r"

Previous studies included four CT scans and three MRIs which did not demonstrate the lesion. A myelogram was noncharacteristic. The correct diagnosis, confirmed by selective angiography, was ultimately contingent upon recognition of the clinical features and natural history of dural spinal cord arteriovenous malformations (SCAVM). The unusual combination of this multitude of nondiagnostic imaging studies in the uncommon dural SCAVM served to delay diagnosis and treatment. Such delay may have great functional consequences. This report illustrates the importance of suspecting SCAVM and recognizing its features. Emphasis is placed on the physiatrist's role in assuring proper diagnosis to expedite a timely treatment and to obtain the best functional outcome. A brief review of the classification, clinical features, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prognosis of SCAVM is presented.\r"

Abnormal thermographic studies were instrumental in uncovering intermittent compression of the subclavian artery, and this prompted us to study the effects of cello playing on skin temperature asymmetry. Temperature asymmetry was defined as the temperature difference (delta-T) from one hand to the other. In 57 controls, mean delta-T at rest was .309 +/- .254C. Exercising the upper extremities by prolonged elbow flexion or by movements mimicking cello playing in controls did not significantly affect delta-T. In our patient, delta-T was ten times control (3.6C). Angiography showed extrinsic compression of the subclavian artery occurring only after cello playing; sympathetic ganglion block relieved the pain. Our patient's abnormal skin temperature may have reflected sympathetic vasomotor hyperactivity. Intermittent neurovascular compression and sympathetic hyperactivity appear to be factors in scalenus anticus syndrome.\r"

A 50-year-old patient with C5 motor functional quadriplegia developed Candid albicans pyelonephritis while undergoing rehabilitation. The patient had several surgical procedures and multiple courses of antibiotic therapy during acute hospitalization. He continued to have a hectic fever curve, leukocytosis with increased band forms, lethargy, and progressive uremia during rehabilitation. Successful investigation of the patient's condition included assessment of serologic tests for Candida precipitin antigen; multiple blood and urine cultures; exclusion of other causes of hectic fever; abdominal computerized tomogram, which revealed a left kidney hypodensity with irregular margins; and a retrograde pyelogram, which demonstrated multiple renal pelvic-filling defects. Cystoscopically placed ureteral stents, which relieved the genitourinary obstruction, drained gross pus from which Candida albicans was cultured; the patient was treated with amphotericin B and showed clinical improvement.

The control strap was attached across the back to a buckle on the unamputated side at the shoulder to provide a more efficient anchor. This created more body contact across the back and formed a type of \"Z\" strap allowing full freedom of movement in any direction. Less forward shoulder flexion was necessary due to decreased cable travel and because the strap was not sliding up and over the shoulder. A single case study is described and the successful outcome for the amputee.\r"

Thirty-nine percent of the total sample of surgeons who responded would prefer not to treat any trauma patients. These surgeons were more likely to be older, to practice in an urban setting, to feel that trauma call has a negative impact on elective practice, and to believe more strongly that reimbursement from trauma patients is not equal to that of nontrauma patients. They also agreed more strongly with the statements that these patients require a greater time commitment and pose an increased medicolegal risk. The most significant influence on preference not to treat trauma patients was exerted by the perception of a negative impact on practice, older age, and perception of increased medicolegal risk. Reimbursement issues and location of practice were less influential factors. This information can be used to target concerns and barriers to active, willing participation in a trauma care system and to tailor strategies to deal with them effectively.\r"

The occurrence of infected intraabdominal bile collections in two patients with preexisting biliary tract infection suggested that abdominal drainage should be performed in such patients. Vascular inflow occlusion is recommended for all liver resections.\r"

We examined the effect of interferon alfa on the function of cells that underwent in vitro sensitization in adoptive immunotherapy. Interferon alfa increased the antitumor reactivity of in vitro sensitized cells in the treatment of MCA 106 pulmonary metastases. This effect was evident in irradiated mice, indicating that a host response to the interferon alfa was not required. Interferon alfa treatment increased class I major histocompatibility complex antigen expression on tumor cells and increased their susceptibility to lysis by in vitro sensitized cells. These results suggest that interferon alfa enhancement of adoptive immunotherapy was mediated by its effect on tumor cells. Interferon alfa may be a useful adjunct to the adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer.\r"

The preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels were predictive of recurrence and survival independent of the tumor stage. In a multivariate regression analysis of age, location, tumor stage, and preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, the latter three factors were significant prognostic variables with respect to the adjusted survival. Recurrent disease was found in 42% of patients, excluding patients with stage IV disease. The carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was greater than 5 ng/mL in 79% of the patients and in 89% of the intra-abdominal recurrences. Carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was not predictive of postrecurrence survival except in the subgroup of locoregional disease. The life span in patients with liver and lung metastases was not influenced by carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence. Preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels can indicate a poorer prognostic group of patients with colorectal cancer who may benefit from adjuvant treatment. The carcinoembryonic antigen at recurrence can be used effectively to diagnose intra-abdominal recurrences and project survival after development of local/regional disease.\r"

Red light (630 nm) was delivered to all peritoneal surfaces from an argon-pumped dye laser at doses ranging from 0.2 to 3.0 J/cm2 in an escalating fashion. Viscera and peritoneal surfaces were anatomically isolated and exposed to light for intervals calculated to deliver the prescribed energy. Light was delivered to mesentery and bowel by a flat-cut optical fiber, while other areas, including diaphragm, viscera, omental bursa, gutters, and pelvis, were delivered light through a diffusing wand. Twenty-three patients (13 with ovarian cancer, eight with sarcoma, and two with pseudomyxoma peritoneii) underwent photodynamic therapy. Five of eight patients cleared positive peritoneal cytologies after treatment. Six patients remained clinically free of disease for up to 18 months, and five patients had treatment-related complications. Intraperitoneal phototherapy is technically feasible and deserving of clinical evaluation.\r"

Both univariate and multivariate analysis of survival and disease-free survival were performed. The major factor in survival outcome was the ability to completely resect the lesion. When the 62 patients who underwent complete resection were examined, the only independent prognostic factor for both survival and disease-free survival was grade. We conclude that completeness of resection and grade of the lesion are primary determinants of survival. Once all tumor is macroscopically removed, no advantage could be demonstrated by more extensive surgical resection or current adjuvant therapy.\r"

Tumor embolization can occur at surgery, so we tested whether surgical stress decreased perioperative NK cell cytotoxicity, and examined the underlying mechanism of suppression. Patients with solid tumors underwent NK cell cytotoxicity assay just before and 24 hours after surgery in a 3-hour chromium 51 release assay. The NK cell cytotoxicity was significantly decreased postoperatively. We considered that surgical NK cell impairment might be due to (1) NK cell redistribution, (2) presence of suppressor cells, or (3) direct \"toxic\" effects on NK cells. Impaired NK cell cytotoxicity was not due to NK cell redistribution, because differential counts showed no significant changes in the percentage of large granular lymphocyte NK morphology. To isolate possible suppressor cells, postoperative cells from patients were selectively depleted of NK cells using anti-Leu-11b monoclonal antibody plus complement; these cells were then mixed with autologous preoperative cells. Postoperative NK cell cytotoxicity was markedly impaired, but the postoperative NK depleted cells did not suppress preoperative NK cells. We conclude that NK cell functional impairment from surgical stress is due to direct \"toxic\" effects on NK cells rather than either NK cell redistribution or the generation of NK-directed suppressor cells.\r"

The overall sensitivity was 77% and a predictive value of a positive detection was 78%. A total of 30 occult sites in 26 patients were identified.

Eighty-seven patients (84%) underwent a subtotal pancreatectomy, and 17 patients (16%) underwent a total pancreatectomy. The postoperative mortality was 5.7% (six patients), and reoperation for postoperative complications was required in six patients. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 34% and 25%, respectively. Eight patients died of tumor recurrence more than 5 years after resection. Patient survival was significantly impaired by microscopic lymphatic invasion, regional nodal metastasis, tumor grade, and the epithelium of origin. In a multivariate analysis, only microscopic lymphatic invasion significantly reduced patient survival. Radical resection for ampullary cancer can be performed with a low morbidity and mortality and should remain the procedure of choice for ampullary carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "We performed a retrospective analysis of 392 patients who underwent curative resection of gastric adenocarcinoma to evaluate the impact of splenectomy on survival from gastric cancer and postoperative morbidity. Twelve factors, including splenectomy, were associated with a poor prognosis by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis identified six of these factors, but not splenectomy, as independently predictive of death due to gastric cancer. The apparent adverse effect of splenectomy was due to its association with other significant risk factors. Postoperative complications occurred more commonly in patients who underwent splenectomy than in those who did not (45% vs 21%); patients in the splenectomy group also had a higher percentage of infectious complications than those in the nonsplenectomy group (75% vs 47%). We conclude that splenectomy has no direct influence on survival, but that it increases the morbidity of curative gastrectomy and should be avoided unless the spleen is close to or invaded by the tumor.\r"

We describe our experience using a biodegradable mesh that allows the small bowel to be supported above the pelvic inlet and is totally absorbed following radiation therapy. Between 1985 and 1989, 45 procedures were performed in patients with carcinoma of the rectum (anterior resection in 15 patients, abdominoperineal resection in 23 patients, pelvic exenteration in six patients, and proctocolectomy in one patient). In 30 patients a polyglycolic acid (Dexon) mesh was used, and in 15 patients a polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) mesh was used. Forty-four patients received postoperative radiotherapy. The mean (+/- SEM) dose was 56.8 +/- 18.4 Gy. There were no immediate complications related to the mesh. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 53 months (median follow-up, 34 months). With the exception of two patients who had a polyglactin 910 mesh and who developed bowel obstruction due to adhesions under the anterior abdominal wall, there has been no documented incidence of clinical radiation-associated small bowel injury. The use of the absorbable mesh may permit us to use higher doses of postoperative radiotherapy without the associated hazard of radiation-associated small bowel injury.\r"

After a burst of pioneering activity from 1880 to 1910, little progress was made until after World War II. In the last 40 years, remarkable advances have been made in the techniques of liver resection, our understanding of liver diseases requiring operation, and our ability to support patients through major resections. Liver transplantation epitomizes the challenges that can now be accepted, and its success augurs well for an increase in liver operations in the future.\r"

The local control of osteoclastic bone resorption is incompletely understood. Various small, locally active molecules, cytokines, have been shown to affect resorptive processes. Additionally, prostaglandins and their inhibitors have been shown to modulate the resorptive process in a number of in vitro studies. In this study, indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, was tested in a model of localized bone resorption, the pressurized gerbil bulla. After the experimental period, indomethacin was found to inhibit the number of osteoclasts and the resorptive area on the inner surface of the bulla. Therefore, it is likely that endogenous cyclooxygenase metabolites are intermediates in the sequence of cellular events, which results in localized bone resorption as in some systemic models.\r"

Six of the children had primary type I clefts that required endoscopic repair. The symptoms included inspiratory stridor, choking during eating, and aspiration. Five of the children had previous transcervical repair of type II clefts that had partial breakdown in the interarytenoid area causing symptoms of aspiration, which required secondary repair endoscopically. All the patients had successful microlaryngoscopic closure; in two children, however, the breakdown of the repair necessitated repeated endoscopic correction. The only complication occurred in a case of postoperative supraglottitis, which was successfully managed with intubation and antibiotics. We conclude that endoscopic repair is a useful and reliable technique and an elegant alternative to the open transcervical approach for the closure of supraglottic laryngeal clefts.\r"

Chemotherapy was administered prior to surgery in 42 patients (induction) and after surgery in an additional 29 patients (sequential). The populations were roughly comparable with respect to tumor site and stage. Twelve of the 42 patients in the induction group and seven of the 29 in the sequential group are alive and with no evidence of disease at the last reported follow-up. The median survival was 31 months in the sequential group vs 20 months in the induction group. Only two of the 26 patients with less than a complete clinical response following induction chemotherapy are still alive. Twenty-seven of the 42 patients who received induction chemotherapy did not undergo surgery as initially planned. Despite the lack of surgery, at 5 years the survival between the two groups was not significantly different (27% for the induction group vs 23% for the sequential group).\r"

C1qBM levels were correlated with computed tomographic evidence of tumor necrosis and/or thyroid cartilage destruction. Results show that patients with stage III/IV disease with tissue necrosis and/or cartilage invasion had demonstrably higher C1qBM levels than did individuals with similarly staged disease with no evidence of these radiographically defined characteristics (120 +/- 81 micrograms/mL vs 18 +/- 15 micrograms/mL); the strongest association was reflected by the area of necrosis within regional lymph metastases. Elevated C1qBM level in patients with stage III/IV laryngeal cancer thus reflects highly aggressive disease, which is less responsive to therapeutic intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Early squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis may be effectively treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Controversy exists as to whether radiation therapy effects survival at the expense of vocal function by ultimately requiring more total laryngectomies for salvage of local tumor recurrence. This study reviewed the medical records of 185 patients with T1 or T2, NO invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis treated with primary radiation therapy between 1969 and 1984. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 5 years after completion of therapy. One hundred sixty-one patients met the criteria for local control analysis. Radiation therapy controlled disease in 93% (105 of 113) of patients with T1 lesions and 73% (38 of 48) of those with T2 tumors. Ultimate control of disease for T1 and T2 lesions, including surgical salvage, was 111 (98%) of 113 and 44 (92%) of 48 patients, respectively. The rate of successful surgical salvage was 75% (T1) and 70% (T2). The T2 lesions with impaired vocal cord mobility or anterior commissure disease were identified as being at increased risk for recurrence after primary radiation therapy. Overall voice preservation was 90%. Our data demonstrate that radiation therapy effects disease-free survival rates that are comparable to those produced by surgery, without sacrificing voice. Although a small percentage of patients with selected early glottic lesions may be more effectively treated with primary conservation surgery, these data do not support a change in philosophy concerning primary treatment of early glottic cancer with radiation therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Younger siblings of children with sensorineural hearing loss of possible hereditary cause underwent interval audiologic examination. Seven siblings (in unrelated families) were found to have progressive sensorineural hearing loss despite early audiograms documenting normal hearing levels for age. Continued testing of these children allowed for early identification and intervention. We advocate regular otolaryngologic and audiologic follow-up even after normal audiologic assessments are made for younger siblings of children with documented sensorineural hearing loss, unless a definite nongenetic origin of the hearing loss in the older child is known. Recessive sensorineural hearing loss with onset in infancy or childhood may present with no antecedent family history and with normal behavioral audiograms early in life.\r"
