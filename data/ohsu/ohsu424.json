  ".W": "Menstrual and peripheral blood samples were collected from 19 regularly cycling women on days 1-3 of the menstrual cycle. Menstrual samples were collected with a soft silicone rubber menstrual cup. Hematocrit, PRL, LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P4) were measured in all samples. Validation studies were carried out for RIAs of PRL, LH, and FSH in menstrual plasma. The menstrual plasma PRL level was significantly higher than its peripheral blood level on day 1 (63.3 +/- 14.7 and 12.1 +/- 2.9 micrograms/L, respectively; t = 3.331; P less than 0.01), and menstrual PRL was significantly higher on day 1 than on day 2 (t = 3.340; P less than 0.01). There was a strong negative correlation between log menstrual PRL concentration and time of onset of menstruation (r = -0.596; P less than 0.01). Menstrual plasma FSH levels were significantly lower than peripheral levels on each of days 1-3 (day 1:t = 4.787; P less than 0.001), and there was a significant positive correlation between menstrual and peripheral levels (r = 0.607; P less than 0.01). By contrast, menstrual plasma LH was significantly higher than the peripheral level on days 1 and 2 (day 1:t = 3.105; day 2:t = 3.180; P less than 0.01), with no correlation between menstrual and peripheral levels. Menstrual E2 was slightly lower than and significantly positively correlated with peripheral E2 (r = 0.646; P less than 0.01). Menstrual P4 was lower than but showed no correlation with peripheral levels. As expected, the menstrual blood hematocrit was less than 0.20 and highly significantly lower than that of peripheral venous blood. These results suggest that PRL is released in substantial amounts from secretory endometrium into the menstrual flow during the first day of menstrual breakdown. LH may also be released in small amounts from menstrual endometrium, while menstrual FSH, E2, and P4 probably arise entirely from the peripheral circulation.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the dynamics of steroid secretion during the luteal-placental shift of early pregnancy in rhesus monkeys. Daily blood samples were obtained from six pregnant rhesus monkeys during the cycle of conception and for the first 44 days of pregnancy to examine the relationships among aromatizable androgens, estrogens, progesterone (P), and CG in the peripheral circulation. To elucidate the biosynthetic mechanisms involved in the changes in hormonal patterns, minces of placentae and corpora lutea (CL) were incubated in vitro with [3H]pregnenolone ([3H]P5) and [3H]androstenedione ([3H]A), and steroid metabolites were isolated and identified by reverse isotope dilution. After a brief rise (corresponding to the approximate time of implantation of the blastocyst), serum P levels declined despite rising serum CG levels and reached a nadir at the time of maximal CG secretion. In contrast, serum androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), estrone (E1), and estradiol (E2) concentrations rose and fell in parallel with CG and reached peak levels near day 24 of pregnancy 2- to 10-fold higher than those during the luteal phase. The CL of early pregnancy produced less than one third as much P from [3H]P5 as did the CL of the cycle, but had a 9-fold greater capacity for estrogen biosynthesis. Total CL aromatase activity did not differ between the nonfertile cycle and early pregnancy. 17-Hydroxylase and C17-20 lyase activities increased in the CL during early pregnancy, since 17-hydroxyprogesterone and A (but not T) syntheses were 3- to 5-fold greater in the CL of early pregnancy than in the CL of the cycle. Although serum E1 and E2 concentrations during early pregnancy were similar, E1 was the predominant estrogen produced from [3H]P5 or [3H] A by luteal tissue in vitro. Placental tissue obtained on days 23-27 of pregnancy produced large amounts of P from [3H]P5, but only trace amounts of estrogens were formed from [3H]A. By day 45 of pregnancy, however, the placenta had acquired substantial amounts of aromatase activity. Neither estrogens nor androgens were formed from [3H]P5 by the placenta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Cord serum samples were analyzed in 185 infants born during a 9-month period (1986-1987) in 2 goitrous and 1 nongoitrous localities of western Colombia. Urinary iodine was determined in all mothers before delivery. No significant differences were found among neonates of the 3 localities (Kruskal-Wallis test) for the various thyroid hormone values, and all values were within the normal range, although there was a trend in distribution of TSH to higher values in both goiter areas. Thyroid autoantibodies (antithyroglobulin and antithyroid microsomal) were negative in all neonates, and iodine intake, as indicated by urinary iodine, was adequate and similar among the mothers of the 3 groups. Those newborn infants with serum TSH values higher than 20 mU/L were reexamined 5-7 months later. At this time, all infants had lower serum TSH values and their serum free T4 index and T3 values were normal. Gestational age, weight, and height at birth were normal and also equal among the neonates in the 3 localities. These results indicate that neonates from goitrous iodine-sufficient areas have thyroid function similar to that of infants born in nongoitrous areas equally supplemented with iodine, and therefore, they are not more at risk to develop congenital hypothyroidism.\r"

Women had a somewhat lower Km but a similar Vmax compared to those in men. The Vmax was increased in patients with hyperthyroidism and decreased in those with hypothyroidism. Successful treatment lowered the initially high Vmax in hyperthyroid patients and raised the low Vmax in hypothyroid patients. One subject with the rare syndrome of thyroid hormone resistance had a Vmax in the upper normal range. The mean Km values of the hyperthyroid and hypothyroid groups and of the subject with thyroid hormone resistance were similar to that of the normal subjects. The results indicate that the initial saturable uptake of T3 by the human erythrocyte is increased in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "We monitored the estrogen metabolism and menstrual function of two groups of elite oarswomen as they progressed from a phase of low intensity training (phase I), to high intensity training (phase II), and back to low intensity training (phase III). Each phase lasted 3 months. The two groups of oarswomen included five oarswomen (group A) who experienced no menstrual dysfunction during the training year, even during the phase of high intensity training, and five oarswomen (group B) who experienced normal menses during phases of low intensity training but disrupted menses during the phase of high intensity training. Four nonathletic controls were also studied. Menstrual function was monitored throughout the training year by assay for pregnanediol glucuronide in overnight 12-h urine samples collected twice weekly. Repeated measures of the extent of estradiol metabolized by 2-hydroxylase oxidation, total body water, and nutrient intake of group A and B oarswomen were made at the three phases of the training year; the extent of estradiol metabolized by 2-hydroxylase oxidation was evaluated by radiometric analysis; total body water was measured by deuterium oxide dilution and bioimpedance analysis; and nutrient intake was evaluated by food frequency questionnaire. The group B oarswomen were found to metabolize a significantly greater fraction of administered [2-3H]estradiol by 2-hydroxylase oxidation than group A oarswomen (chi 2(1) = 6.57; P = 0.01). The extent of estradiol metabolized by 2-hydroxylase oxidation among group A oarswomen did not differ from that among nonathletic controls. The extent of 2-hydroxylase activity did not change significantly with the intensity of training among either group A or group B oarswomen. Oarswomen in groups A and B lost body weight and became leaner during the phase of high intensity training (phase II). Group A and B oarswomen did not differ in the degree of weight loss or in relative fatness during phase II. Over all subjects, the extent of estradiol metabolized by 2-hydroxylase oxidation was positively correlated with the extent of leanness. These data suggest that elevated estradiol 2-hydroxylase oxidation among elite oarswomen is associated with the occurrence of menstrual disturbances during phases of high intensity training and increased relative leanness.\r"

It is generally believed that the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1 alpha-hydroxylase does not respond appropriately to either hypophosphatemia or PTH in this condition. We performed 6-h human PTH-(1-34) infusions in five patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets who were receiving vitamin D and phosphate therapy. We measured changes in serum 1,25-(OH)2D, serum calcium, urinary nephrogenous cAMP, and phosphate clearance. Human PTH-(1-34) caused a rise in serum calcium, a rise in nephrogenous cAMP, a fall in renal phosphate reabsorption, and, in particular, a rise in serum 1,25-(OH)2D. All of these responses were indistinguishable from those in normal subjects or patients with surgical or idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. The population studied was not homogeneous, and in one elderly man with mild renal impairment serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations did not increase. Nevertheless, these results suggest that absolute PTH resistance is not a feature of X-linked hypophosphatemic ricket, although subtle forms of resistance at the level of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme are not excluded by these data.\r"

  ".W": "In this report we identify two cultured human primitive neuroepithelioma cell lines that express cholecystokinin (CCK) RNA and synthesize substantial amounts of pro-CCK, but differ in their ability to process the prohormone. Seven cultured human neural tumor lines, including two primitive neuroepitheliomas and five neuroblastomas, were screened for CCK gene expression using a CCK C-terminal RIA system, a RIA specific for the carboxy-terminal extension of prepro-CCK, and RNAse protection assays specific for CCK mRNA. RNA derived from the two primitive neuroepitheliomas yielded strong hybridization signals with CCK-specific probes. The five other neuronal tumors were negative for CCK mRNA. The two primitive neuroepitheliomas also synthesized substantial quantities of material reactive in the CCK carboxy-terminal extension RIA system. One of the tumors, Sk-N-Mc, postranslationally processed the CCK prohormonal material poorly, yielding only high mol wt CCK precursors and no immunoreactive CCK. The other, SK-PN-Dw, was able to process the prohormone, producing immunoreactive CCK-like material plus a peptide that immunochemically and chromatographically resembled the intact CCK C-terminal extension peptide. These cultured tumor lines should prove useful in furthering our understanding of the regulation of the CCK gene in human neuronal cells and will also provide an in vitro system for investigation of the posttranslational processing of the CCK preprohormone. In addition, the data demonstrate that screening procedures for examining peptide hormone expression by tumors are most comprehensive when specific molecular genetic probes are employed in addition to standard peptide assay methodology. Finally, these data suggest that CCK production may be a feature of some primitive neuroepitheliomas.\r"

  ".U": "89327431\r", 
  ".W": "Dopamine may exert a tonic inhibitory effect on aldosterone secretion and enhance renal sodium excretion. Nonmodulating hypertension in part is characterized by decreased aldosterone secretion in response to angiotensin II (AII) as well as a decreased natriuretic response to a saline load. This study assesses whether an abnormally increased dopaminergic inhibition of aldosterone secretion underlies the adrenal defect in nonmodulating hypertension and whether abnormalities of renal dopamine formation contribute to sodium retention. We measured the plasma dopamine concentration in 39 patients with nonmodulating hypertension and in 32 patients with normal modulation on a 10-meq sodium intake. Dopamine levels were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in nonmodulators. The aldosterone response to AII (3 ng/kg.min) was assessed before and during administration of the dopamine antagonist metoclopramide in 13 patients. Metoclopramide did not change the adrenal response to AII in either hypertensive subgroup. In 12 normal subjects mean urinary dopamine levels were higher in a sodium-replete state (200-mmol intake) than in a low sodium state (10-mmol intake; 1.68 +/- 0.28 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.22 mumol/day; P less than 0.01) as expected. Modulators demonstrated this same effect, while nonmodulators did not [modulators, 3.66 +/- 0.82 and 1.37 +/- 0.14 mumol/day; nonmodulators, 1.33 +/- 0.28 and 1.68 +/- 0.90 mumol/day; P less than 0.02]. The sodium-retaining tendency of nonmodulators may reflect, at least in part, reduced intrarenal dopamine production in the sodium-replete state, but the adrenal defect in aldosterone release in nonmodulators is not mediated by excess dopaminergic inhibition of aldosterone secretion.\r"

To determine whether plasma P5C levels fluctuate enough physiologically to regulate such pathways in vivo, we measured venous plasma P5C concentrations hourly for 48 h in five normal subjects while eating and in four subjects while fasting. Two fed subjects had one or more plasma P5C excursions per day exceeding 10 times the baseline level; the other fed subjects had lesser variations. These patterns suggest a relationship of plasma P5C peaks to meals. This relationship is supported by the finding of no significant P5C elevations above baseline levels in four subjects during fasting for 24 h. Despite the changes in plasma P5C concentrations, those of proline and other metabolically related amino acids were constant. The variation among subjects in the degree of plasma P5C fluctuation could not be explained by differences in total protein and caloric intake or body weight. Among plasma constituents, the large peak to basal plasma P5C excursions in some of the normal subjects we studied are matched only by those of peptide hormones.\r"

Triac has been used successfully to treat eight patients with thyroid hormone resistance. We gave Triac to a woman with selective pituitary resistance for treatment of hyperthyroidism (patient 1) and to a man with generalized resistance and chronic schizophrenia to determine whether it would improve his schizophrenia (patient 2). Patient 1 was given 0.35-3.5 mg Triac/day; patient 2 was given 0.7-4.2 mg/day. Dosages were increased by 0.7 mg/day every 2 weeks. Serum T3, T4, free T4, TSH, TSH response to TRH, systolic time intervals (STI), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and lipids were monitored bimonthly. In both patients, there was no change in symptoms, weight, lipids, or STI. In patient 1, basal TSH suppressed from 16.3 to 1.5 mU/L; in patient 2, from 2.0 to 0.5 mU/L. The peak TSH response to TRH stimulation decreased from 144 to 12.5 mU/L in patient 1 and from 14.2 to 2.8 mU/L in patient 2. Serum T4 decreased from 160 to 109 nmol/L in patient 1 and from 270 to 192 nmol/L in patient 2. ACE levels were persistently elevated in both patients. Resting energy expenditure, measured by oxygen consumption, was increased by Triac in both patients (12% in patient 1 and 9% in patient 2). Although Triac suppressed TSH and T4 secretion in both patients, it did not reduce peripheral action of thyroid hormone as expressed in STI, resting energy expenditure, and ACE. We conclude that in these two patients with resistance to thyroid hormone, at the doses used to suppress TSH and T4 secretion, the intrinsic peripheral action of Triac offset whatever decrease in thyroid hormone secretion it produced.\r"

Those in group A had basal serum PRL levels higher than 100 micrograms/L, and those in group B had basal serum PRL levels lower than 100 micrograms/L. Serum PRL levels in both groups were determined before and hourly for 8 h after a single oral dose of either 2 mg hydergine or placebo. Hydergine induced a significant (P less than 0.01) decrease in the serum PRL level, compared with placebo, in both groups. The fall in mean serum PRL in group A was significant (P less than 0.05) 300 min after hydergine administration, and the concentration remained low at 480 min, at 45.5% of the mean baseline value. However, the serum PRL concentration did not reach the normal PRL range in any group A patient. Chronic treatment with this drug (2 mg, 3 times daily, for 4-12 weeks) in 5 patients from group A normalized the serum PRL concentration in only 1 patient and did not induce ovulation in any patient. In group B, also, hydergine administration significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced the mean serum PRL concentration within 240 min, and it declined further to within the normal range. The mean maximal reduction was to 56.4% of the baseline value at 360 min. All of the group B women received chronic treatment (2 mg, 3 times daily, for 4-104 weeks); repeated ovulation was induced in 7 (78%). Seven pregnancies ensued in 6 of the women in whom ovulation had been induced, and 4 normal infants were delivered. There were no side-effects, such as nausea and vomiting, during these trials. These data indicate that hydergine has PRL inhibitory activity and is useful in the treatment of hyperprolactinemic anovulatory patients whose basal serum PRL concentrations are below 100 micrograms/L.\r"

We found no evidence that skin cancer had arisen in disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis lesions. A review of the etiologic and clinical features of disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis also is presented.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the effectiveness of systemic interferon alfa-nl versus isotretinoin in the treatment of condylomata acuminata. Patients were randomly assigned interferon alfa-nl, 5 million units, subcutaneously daily for 2 weeks then twice weekly for 4 weeks, or isotretinoin, 1 mg/kg by mouth daily for 6 weeks. Seventeen otherwise healthy men with histologically confirmed condylomata acuminata refractory to standard treatment completed 6 study weeks. Five of nine men (56%) treated with interferon alfa-nl had an objective clinical response (greater than or equal to 50% clearance of baseline disease), with one patient clearing completely. None of the patients treated with isotretinoin alone had an objective response (p = 0.009). Those whose clearing was incomplete with interferon alone were then assigned to interferon therapy three times weekly in combination with daily isotretinoin for 6 weeks, and those receiving isotretinoin were switched to interferon three times weekly for 6 weeks. There was continued clearing in all patients in the combination treatment group but in only three of seven in the sequential treatment group. Side effects were common and generally predictable for each drug but were generally not exacerbated when interferon and isotretinoin were used in combination. Parenteral interferon alfa-nl is an effective alternative treatment modality for patients with refractory condylomata acuminata.\r"

The mice were sensitized on the clipped dorsal skin and challenged on the ears. Changes in ear thickness after challenge were used to measure the degree of photosensitivity. The efficacy of two doses of each topical sunscreen was assessed by the degree of suppression of the contact photosensitivity response at challenge. Control studies were performed with the base of each sunscreen. Some but not all sunscreens that contained UVA-absorbing chemicals showed active suppression of contact photosensitivity in this test system. Several sunscreens gave greater suppression at 5 microliters/cm2 than at 2 microliters/cm2, which suggests a dose-related effect. One sunscreen, however, gave greater suppression at 2 microliters/cm2. Several of the bases tested also suppressed the contact photosensitivity response. An unexpected finding was an enhancement of the contact photosensitivity reaction by two of the bases tested.\r"

The upper aspect of the back and chest were the most commonly affected sites, with the neck being the third. Boys had significantly (p less than 0.01) more melanocytic nevi than girls, and prevalence was highest in children with pale skin and light-colored hair. Nonwhite heritage had a protective effect independent of pigmentary characteristics. Total numbers of nevi on children also were related to maternal tendency to large numbers of moles and to family history of melanoma. The only significant association observed for the presence of large (greater than 5 mm) nevi on children was a family history of melanoma. The children studied come from a general population that has the highest known risk of melanoma. In Australia they have been shown to have the highest prevalence of nevi ever reported in the prepubertal age group. These descriptive data, together with the specific pigmentary and family associations described, extend the known links between benign nevi and malignant melanoma.\r"

The mean serum level of 8-methoxypsoralen 60 minutes after completion of hand and foot soaks was 2.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml compared with 95.75 +/- 10.43 ng/ml after oral 8-methoxypsoralen, 0.5 mg/kg.

The highest sensitivity was determined for nuclear atypia (84%), followed by the asymmetry of the lesion (81.3%) and the presence of single cells in the upper layers of the epidermis (80.3%). The sensitivity was limited for the inflammatory reaction of the dermis (56%), poor demarcation of the lesion (49.3%), and infiltration of the adnexa (47.7%). For the mitotic activity a low sensitivity was found (33.3%). In only 7.6% of cases all criteria investigated (with the exception of the infiltration of adnexa) were simultaneously present. The three most sensitive criteria could be found in 46% of cases and two of these criteria in 88% of cases. In conclusion, this semiquantitative analysis of histologic criteria revealed that (1) thin malignant melanomas can be diagnosed with a few, but very sensitive, criteria and (2) the absence of criteria with minor sensitivity is not helpful for correct diagnosis.\r"

Histopathologic examination of four lesions revealed lobular capillary hemangioma, also known as pyogenic granuloma. Treated lesions did not recur after surgical excision or electrocauterization. Five months after the onset of the eruption, no new lesions were developing, and some were resolving spontaneously after bleeding. Eruptive, disseminated lobular capillary hemangioma is a rare, self-limited cutaneous disorder that occurs in otherwise healthy persons.\r"

We describe a 31-year-old Mexican-American man with multiple histiocytoid hemangiomas involving skin, subcutaneous tissue, and bone limited to the left arm and hand. Examination of skin and bone lesion biopsy specimens showed a proliferation of histiocytoid endothelial cells with intracytoplasmic vacuoles and associated vascular lumen formation. Ultrastructural and immunoperoxidase studies supported endothelial cell differentiation. Radiation therapy resulted in significant clinical improvement. Current concepts regarding the clinical and pathologic features of this disease spectrum also are discussed.\r"

This cutaneous lesion heralded the relapse of acute myelogenous leukemia. A review of the literature indicates that acute nonlymphocytic leukemia rarely presents as an ulcer or on the genitalia, thus emphasizing the uniqueness of this case regarding morphology, and site of presentation. To our knowledge, this is the first case of leukemia cutis presenting as a scrotal ulcer. Therefore leukemia cutis should be added to the differential diagnosis of chronic genital ulcers. Also, because a variety of skin lesions may signify the relapse of leukemia, any skin lesion in a patient with leukemia should be examined by biopsy.\r"

S91 murine melanoma cells were implanted into preformed intradermal blister cavities on the backs of DBA/2J mice. Evaluation of treatment response was undertaken after single and fractionated doses of hyperthermia. A single 60-second treatment at 46 degrees C did not result in any complete regressions, while 3 weekly 46 degrees C treatments produced a 40% incidence of tumor regression. Higher temperature therapy was associated with improved cure rates. A single treatment for 60 seconds at 50 degrees C resulted in a 25% complete response rate while 3 weekly 50 degrees C treatments resulted in the eradication of 92% of the treated tumors. In those tumors that responded only partially to hyperthermia, fractionated low- (46 degrees C) and (50 degrees C) high-dose regimens resulted in significantly smaller melanomas than single-treatment schedules at the same temperatures. It is concluded that fractionated hyperthermia is an effective modality in the control of intracutaneous murine melanoma. If other cutaneous malignancies are also sensitive to heat, this may provide a useful nonsurgical means of treating skin cancer.\r"

In the second period, no tumor changes were observed, but no new tumors appeared. Surgical excisions of the remaining tumors were carried out 3 months after the end of the etretinate treatment, with excellent results and no recurrences after 6 months of follow-up. Treatment with etretinate permits a less aggressive surgical excision and recurrence rate than surgical excision alone.\r"

Among eight patients with inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, six suffered arrhythmic events during a median follow-up period of 16 months. No patient without inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia suffered an arrhythmic event. Multivariate analysis showed that of all the variables examined, inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was the only independent predictor of arrhythmic events during the follow-up period. The sensitivity for predicting arrhythmic events by this response was 100%, the specificity 97% and the positive predictive accuracy 75%. Individually, the other prognostic variables were less sensitive and much less accurate predictors of arrhythmic events, but the combination of the occurrence of acute phase complications or frequent ectopic activity with an abnormal signal-averaged ECG approached the sensitivity and accuracy of inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. The prognostic utility of programmed ventricular stimulation in patients with recent myocardial infarction is limited because comparable information can be obtained less invasively. However, the test may have a role in selecting therapy in patients judged to be at risk from arrhythmias on the basis of noninvasive assessment.\r"

A 12 lead electrocardiogram was continuously recorded in each patient. Blood lactate in the aorta and great cardiac vein was measured during the procedure, and the lactate extraction ratio in the anterior wall was determined both before and during balloon occlusion. Eight of the 10 patients in group A and 1 of the 7 patients in group B had a dominant large right coronary artery. There were no significant differences in summed ST segment elevation in leads II, III and a VF between group A (0.56 +/- 0.26 mV) and group B (0.46 +/- 0.19 mV) during balloon occlusion of the right coronary artery, and no significant differences in summed ST segment depression in leads V1 to V6 during balloon occlusion between group A (0.44 +/- 0.26 mV) and group C (0.38 +/- 0.14 mV). Lactate extraction ratio before balloon occlusion was similar among the three groups. Patients in group A had a higher lactate extraction ratio during (38 +/- 11%) compared with before (30 +/- 11%) (p less than 0.05) balloon occlusion despite precordial ST segment depression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The failure of exercise-induced ST segment depression to consistently predict prognosis in patients after myocardial infarction could be a result of population differences and the rest electrocardiogram (ECG). These hypotheses were tested by studying 198 veterans who survived a myocardial infarction, underwent a submaximal predischarge treadmill exercise test and were followed up for cardiac events for 2 years. During the 2 years, 29 deaths, 19 reinfarctions and 28 revascularization procedures were documented. The prevalence of death or reinfarction was two times higher in patients who had exercise-induced ST depression than in patients who did not. However, in the 55 patients without Q waves, the risk increased to 11 times for an abnormal ST response. These findings suggest that exercise-induced ST depression only predicts high risk in patients after myocardial infarction whose ECG at rest does not exhibit Q waves and that differences in the prevalence of rest ECG patterns are the most likely explanation for the failure of agreement among prior studies.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary hypertension in chronic mitral valve disease has been related most commonly to left ventricular dysfunction or mitral stenosis; its association with chronic, isolated mitral regurgitation and preserved left ventricular systolic function is unclear. In 41 catheterized patients with chronic mitral regurgitation (known history of mitral regurgitation for greater than 18 months) and preserved left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction greater than 0.55), historic, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and hemodynamic variables were analyzed. Ten patients (Group I) had normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure (less than 30 mm Hg), whereas 31 patients had pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was mildly increased (30 to 49 mm Hg) in 13 patients (Group II) and was greater than or equal to 50 mm Hg in 18 patients (Group III). Univariate analysis showed the more frequent occurrence of male gender and ruptured chordae tendineae in the groups with pulmonary hypertension. Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, size of the V wave in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary arteriole resistance were higher, whereas cardiac index was lower in the hypertension groups. Multivariate stepwise analysis revealed higher mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary arteriole resistance as the only variables independently differing among groups. In conclusion, pulmonary hypertension occurs frequently (76% of cases) in patients with chronic, isolated mitral regurgitation with preserved left ventricular systolic function. In these patients, a severe increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is associated with elevation in pulmonary artery resistance, a finding similar to that in mitral stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "In patients suffering from end-stage congestive cardiomyopathy, cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptor function is markedly reduced, whereas cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptor function is nearly normal. To determine whether beta 1-adrenoceptor function is impaired in heart failure selectively, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor density and functional responsiveness in the right and left atria and the left papillary muscles from patients with mitral valve disease (functional class III to IV) were studied. In all three tissues concomitantly beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor density gradually declined when the degree of heart failure increased from functional class III to IV. This decrease in beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor density was accompanied by similar decreases in the contractile response of isolated electrically driven right atrial and left ventricular papillary muscles to beta-adrenergic agonists. It is concluded that a decrease in cardiac beta-adrenoceptor function is a general phenomenon in heart failure, and its extent is related to the degree of heart failure. However, in contrast to congestive cardiomyopathy, in mitral valve disease the decrease in cardiac beta-adrenoceptor function is due to a concomitant decrease in beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".W": "Between December 1981 and June 1987, 71 patients underwent aortic valve replacement with a Bicer monostrut tilting disc prosthesis. Clinical results and in vivo function of the artificial valve were assessed. The average age of the 71 patients at the time of operation was 51.3 +/- 11.5 years. The hospital mortality rate was 2.8% (two patients) and there were no further deaths during a mean (+/- SD) follow-up period of 2.4 +/- 1.6 years (range 1 month to 5.5 years) after surgery. There was also no occurrence of thromboembolism or valve dysfunction. Function of the Bicer valve prosthesis was assessed in 17 patients: 5 with a 21 mm valve, 7 with a 23 mm valve and 5 with a 25 mm valve. Examination was performed on average 10.3 +/- 8.1 months after surgery. Valve function was examined at rest and during exercise performed with a bicycle ergometer. Pressure gradients at rest were low: 21 mm valve = 8 mm Hg, 23 mm valve = 3 mm Hg and 25 mm valve = 2 mm Hg; the gradients during exercise were 11, 8 and 8 mm Hg, respectively. The valves had the following effective orifice area at rest: 21 mm valve = 1.54 cm2, 23 mm valve = 4.20 cm2 and 25 mm valve = 3.76 cm2; during exercise, the respective areas were 1.57, 3.48 and 3.01 cm2. These valves are deemed to be sufficiently wide for effective valve function. Aortographic observation indicated mild regurgitation that was within reasonable limits and posed no problem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Left ventricular volumes were calculated with use of a Simpson's rule algorithm, wall thickness was obtained iteratively, and both midwall circumferential and meridional stresses were computed frame by frame. The maximal pressure/volume and both circumferential and meridional maximal stress/volume ratios were calculated using a single beat from each loading condition assuming a zero volume-axis intercept. Mean left ventricular systolic pressure increased 47% during the methoxamine infusion and decreased 22% during the nitroprusside infusion compared with control (p less than 0.001 for both). Despite these changes in left ventricular systolic pressure, heart rate was eliminated as a confounding variable by right atrial pacing; and mean maximal rate of change of left ventricular pressure [(+)dP/dtmax] and rate of change at developed pressure 40 mm Hg [(+)(dP/dt) per DP40] values did not differ significantly. Mean single beat maximal pressure/volume ratios also did not differ significantly among the three loading conditions. In contrast, mean single beat circumferential and meridional maximal stress/volume ratios were 3.15 +/- 1.83 and 1.40 +/- 0.82 g/cm2 per ml at control; they increased to 4.47 +/- 2.44 and 2.21 +/- 1.25 g/cm2 per ml during the methoxamine infusion (p less than 0.001 for both), and they decreased during the nitroprusside infusion to 2.58 +/- 1.47 and 1.14 +/- 0.57 g/cm2 per ml (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The feasibility, safety and usefulness of dipyridamole echocardiography (two-dimensional echocardiography and 12 lead electrocardiographic monitoring during dipyridamole infusion, up to 0.84 mg/kg over 10 min) were evaluated in 94 asymptomatic patients 8 to 10 days after uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction. The results were compared with those of symptom-limited treadmill exercise testing and correlated with coronary angiography. Two mechanical patterns of positivity of dipyridamole echocardiography could be identified: 1) a new wall motion abnormality confined to the infarct zone or to the adjacent segments (24 patients), and 2) transient remote asynergy (33 patients). The success rate in recording adequate images during dipyridamole infusion was 100%. Interobserver agreement concerning diagnosis occurred in 89 (93%) of 94 patients. Dipyridamole echocardiography was well tolerated; no complication was observed during or after the test. Seventy-three patients underwent coronary angiography within 6 weeks after acute myocardial infarction. Transient remote asynergy on echocardiography was present in 27 of 40 patients with multivessel disease and in none of 33 patients without multivessel disease. Results of treadmill exercise testing were positive in 28 patients with multivessel disease and 8 patients without multivessel disease. Thus, the sensitivity of dipyridamole-induced transient remote asynergy was 68% compared with 52% for treadmill testing (p less than 0.05); specificity was 100% and 72%, respectively (p less than 0.005). The overall accuracy of dipyridamole echocardiography (81%) was higher than that of dipyridamole stress electrocardiography (63%) or exercise electrocardiography (60%) (p less than 0.02). It is concluded that dipyridamole echocardiography is a useful, feasible and inexpensive nonexercise-dependent test for detecting the extent of coronary artery disease early after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether high intensity, long-term aerobic training causes the left ventricle to develop different mechanisms for increasing cardiac output during submaximal and maximal upright bicycle exercise. Fifteen competitive collegiate long distance runners and 14 healthy sedentary adults were studied with use of subcostal view four chamber two-dimensional echocardiography at rest and during and at peak maximal upright bicycle exercise. At rest, the athletes had a larger end-diastolic volume index (85 +/- 14 ml/m2) (mean +/- 1 SD) than that of the sedentary adults (62 +/- 14 ml/m2) and a larger end-systolic volume index (37 +/- 11 versus 21 +/- 6 ml/m2). During low and moderate intensity exercise, end-diastolic and stroke volume indexes increased in both groups, but at high intensity exercise and at peak exercise the end-diastolic volume index of both groups decreased significantly below rest value (athletes, 61 +/- 14; sedentary subjects, 46 +/- 10 ml/m2, both p less than 0.001 compared with rest). Reflecting the decreased end-diastolic volume index, at peak exercise, the stroke volume index had decreased from intermediate exercise values in both groups and was not different from rest values. Therefore, although long distance runners have a dilated left ventricle at rest, they utilize the same mechanisms as sedentary adults for increasing cardiac output during upright dynamic exercise. At low and moderate level exercise, the Frank-Starling mechanism is a dominant mechanism for increasing cardiac output, but at peak exercise, probably because of reduced diastolic left ventricular filling, enhanced contractility is the major mechanism for maintaining stroke volume.\r"

None of the patients had symptoms of heart failure or ischemic heart disease, and at cardiac catheterization none had significant coronary artery disease or left ventricular wall motion abnormalities. In addition, all patients underwent left and right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy and ventricular stimulation studies. Signal-averaged ECG was performed and late QRS potentials were defined with use of Simson's method. Late QRS potentials were detected in a minority (18%) of patients including 2 of 23 with nonsustained and 5 of 15 with sustained (p = NS) ventricular tachycardia. Fifteen patients (40%) had abnormal endomyocardial biopsy results and these findings were more common in patients with sustained than in those with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (9 of 15 versus 6 of 23, p less than 0.05). Late potentials were associated with abnormal endomyocardial biopsy findings (6 of 15 versus 1 of 23, p less than 0.01). An increase in fibrous tissue was the most frequent histopathologic abnormality; this increase was quantified by morphometric methods and compared with biopsy findings in normal control subjects. In the control group the proportion of collagen in relation to myocytes was less than 10%. All patients with both late potentials and abnormal biopsy findings had a greater than 15% ratio of collagen to myocytes in at least one specimen and the biopsies revealed marked interstitial fibrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In five patients with prior myocardial infarction, sustained ventricular tachycardia with identical QRS configuration was inducible before and after intravenous infusion of procainamide. Transient entrainment of ventricular tachycardia was demonstrated at two or more cycle lengths by rapid pacing in the baseline state and after procainamide. Rapid pacing was performed from the same site during sinus rhythm at the cycle lengths that demonstrated transient entrainment of ventricular tachycardia. The conduction interval to the transiently entrained site during ventricular tachycardia (orthodromic interval) was compared with the conduction interval to the same site during pacing in sinus rhythm (antidromic interval). The mean tachycardia cycle length increased by 27% after procainamide administration (p = 0.002). The antidromic conduction intervals were prolonged by 9% (p = 0.06) compared with a 28% increase in the mean orthodromic conduction interval (p = 0.002). The difference between the orthodromic and antidromic conduction intervals increased by 40% (p = 0.003). Prolongation of the tachycardia cycle length after procainamide administration correlated positively with increases in the orthodromic conduction intervals (r = 0.94, p = 0.02) but not with changes in the antidromic intervals (r = -0.08, p = NS). The effect of procainamide on the difference between correlated strongly with changes in the cycle length of ventricular tachycardia (r = 0.97, p = 0.006).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean age (+/- SD) of the patients was 56 +/- 19 years; structural heart disease was present in 47 patients and absent in 52. Complete follow-up was available in 95 patients. During 20 +/- 11 months of follow-up, 2 patients (2%) died suddenly, 19 patients (20%) had recurrent syncope and 74 patients (78%) had no further episodes of syncope. Among the 19 patients who continued to have syncope after the electrophysiologic testing, the cause of syncope was established clinically in 4 and was found to be high degree atrioventricular (AV) block (2 patients) or sinus node dysfunction (2 patients). No clinical or laboratory findings distinguished patients who had sudden death or syncope during follow-up from patients who did not. In conclusion, in patients with unexplained syncope who undergo an electrophysiologic test that is nondiagnostic 1) the incidence of sudden death is low (2%); 2) the remission rate of syncope is high (80%); 3) the electrophysiologic test may be documented to have been falsely negative in greater than or equal to 20% of patients who continue to have syncope, syncope in these patients being caused by AV block or sinus node dysfunction; and 4) patients at risk of sudden death or recurrent syncope, or both, cannot be readily identified prospectively.\r"

In 9 of 10 patients in whom dilation was successfully performed, the conduit valve gradient decreased by 59 +/- 13%, right ventricle to pulmonary artery gradient by 43 +/- 22% and right ventricular pressure by 31 +/- 11%. After dilation, right ventricular pressure was less than 65% of systemic pressure in seven patients, although no pressure was less than 40%. In 8 of the 11 patients, surgery was avoided or postponed. Complications included loss of a balloon fragment after rupture during the unsuccessful dilation of the right atrium to left pulmonary artery graft and circumferential balloon rupture requiring catheter retrieval of the distal portion of the balloon from the femoral vein after successful dilation of the right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit. Conduit valve dilation by balloon can reduce but rarely eliminate conduit obstruction, and balloon rupture may occur and can result in fragment loss or embolization.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis was undertaken to define the natural history and long-term follow-up of a group of patients with Marfan's syndrome. Eighty-four patients were diagnosed between January 1959 and June 1987 as having Marfan's syndrome; 68% were male; their ages ranged from 2 to 67 years (mean 26.6). Sixteen patients constituted the early surgical group (those who underwent surgery before 1979; mean age 36.1 years). Nineteen patients constituted the late surgical group (surgery in 1979 or later; mean age 33.3 years). The nonsurgical group comprised 49 patients (mean age 19.3 years). Fifty-seven percent of the patients had a diastolic murmur and 38% had cardiomegaly at presentation. Fifty-seven percent underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed aortic root dilation (85%), aortic regurgitation (73%), aortic dissection (33%) and mitral regurgitation (36%). Thirteen of the 19 patients in the late surgical group received a composite graft repair of the ascending aorta as compared with only 2 of the 16 in the early surgical group. Follow-up information was obtained on 81 (96%) of 84 patients; the follow-up time was 2 to 332 months (mean 99). Thirty-one of the 81 patients died at age 3 to 63 years (mean age 35 years); 87% of the known causes of death were related to the cardiovascular system. Sixty-one percent of deaths were the result of aortic dissection or rupture or sudden cardiac death. Of the 50 survivors, 98%, including all patients in the late surgical group, were in functional class I or II. Overall survival at 5, 10 and 15 years after operation was 78.4%, 57.1% and 49.5%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89327747\r", 
  ".W": "To clarify the role of serotonin in eliciting myocardial ischemia, the effects of serotonin on coronary vasculature and cardiac performance were examined in anesthetized open chest dogs. Without coronary stenosis, intracoronary infusion of serotonin (0.001 to 1.0 micrograms/kg per min) for 40 s caused dose-dependent increases in coronary blood flow up to 175 +/- 8.3%. During fixed coronary stenosis produced by a metal constrictor that restricted active vasomotion of the stenosed segment, only the highest dose of serotonin increased coronary blood flow by 23 +/- 5.7% and decreased distal coronary pressure without any changes in stenosis resistance and systemic hemodynamic variables. During dynamic coronary stenosis created by inflation of an intraluminal microballoon that preserved active vasomotion of the stenosed segment, intracoronary serotonin (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms/kg per min) evoked marked decreases in coronary blood flow and distal coronary pressure and an increase in stenosis resistance, resulting in an elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and worsening of left ventricular dP/dt. These deleterious effects were reversed by additive intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerin (10 micrograms/min). The detrimental effects of serotonin were not attenuated by pretreatment with aspirin (10 mg/kg, intravenously), which suppressed adenosine disphosphate- and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation in vitro. Furthermore, intracoronary infusion of serotonin (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms/kg per min) from the site distal to coronary stenosis failed to decrease coronary blood flow during dynamic coronary stenosis. Therefore, these detrimental effects of serotonin during dynamic coronary stenosis could be caused by constriction of a large coronary artery but not by platelet aggregation. Vascular effects of serotonin without coronary stenosis and with dynamic coronary stenosis were inhibited by pretreatment with methysergide (0.3 mg/kg, intravenously), but not with ketanserin (0.5 mg/kg, intravenously) which inhibited serotonin-induced platelet aggregation in vitro. Thus, serotonin produced opposing effects on coronary vasculature, that is, small coronary artery dilation and large coronary artery constriction. Both vascular effects were mediated by non-S2-serotonergic receptor activation of the coronary artery. The data obtained in this study suggest that serotonin-elicited constriction of a large coronary artery may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia during pliable coronary stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that canine and human hearts exhibit a cardiac cycle-dependent variation of integrated backscatter (cyclic variation) that reflects intrinsic regional contractile performance. To determine whether ultrasound tissue characterization can identify viable though stunned myocardium before recovery of regional wall thickening, transient ischemic injury was produced in eight open chest dogs for 15 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. Cyclic variation and wall thickening were measured before ischemia, at 15 min after the onset of ischemia and at selected intervals after the onset of reperfusion from multiple sites within the ischemic zone with a novel combined two-dimensional and M-mode acquisition system. Cyclic variation and wall thickening were computed from digitized M-mode integrated backscatter images with an algorithm developed and validated for this purpose. Magnitude and \"delay\" of cyclic variation and wall thickening were compared. Delay represents the degree of synchrony of regional cyclic variation or wall thickening with global ventricular mechanical systole. Baseline cyclic variation and wall thickening magnitudes were 3.8 +/- 0.2 dB and 37 +/- 1.4%, respectively. With ischemia, cyclic variation and wall thickening decreased to 1.7 +/- 0.2 dB and 17 +/- 2%, respectively (p less than 0.05, compared with baseline). Cyclic variation recovered to baseline levels within 20 min after reperfusion (3.3 +/- 0.4 dB, p = NS). Wall thickening remained depressed for 2 h after the onset of reperfusion (23 +/- 2%, p less than 0.05 compared with baseline). Delay of cyclic variation in a unitless ratio expressed as delay (in milliseconds) divided by the QT interval (in milliseconds) increased from 0.87 +/- 0.03 at baseline to 1.10 +/- 0.12 with ischemia, a change consistent with mild asynchrony, and returned to baseline (0.95 +/- 0.07, p = NS compared with baseline) within 20 min after reperfusion. Delay of wall thickening was 0.88 +/- 0.02 at baseline, increased to 1.23 +/- 0.09 with ischemia and remained significantly increased 2 h after reperfusion (1.07 +/- 0.05, p less than 0.05 compared with baseline). Recovery time constants for cyclic variation and wall thickening with reperfusion reflected earlier restoration of cyclic variation (8.1 min) than of wall thickening (420.5 min). Thus, cyclic variation recovers before wall thickening with reperfusion. Its analysis appears to provide a useful index of the presence of viable and potentially salvageable tissue in regions of stunned myocardium that is independent of wall thickening.\r"

To identify acute myocardial perfusion abnormalities, the use of the paramagnetic agent manganese gluconate combined with calcium gluconate (MnGlu/CaGlu) was investigated in canine models of acute coronary artery occlusion. In vitro studies showed that MnGlu/CaGlu was a more efficient relaxing agent than gadolinium-DTPA (relaxivity of 7.8 versus 5.1 s-1 mM-1) and demonstrated affinity for normal myocardium. The distribution of MnGlu/CaGlu as measured by manganese-54 tracer studies was proportional to myocardial blood flow in both normal and ischemic tissue. Hearts excised from dogs after coronary artery occlusion and administration of 0.035 mM/kg MnGlu/CaGlu were imaged ex vivo using a relatively spin-lattice relaxation time (T1)-weighted gradient reversal technique (repetition time [TR] 50 ms and echo time [TE] 9 ms). These images showed increased signal intensity in the normally perfused myocardium with a mean signal intensity ratio of hypoperfused to normal myocardium of 0.55 +/- 0.12 (mean +/- SD). In vivo images obtained in nine dogs after coronary artery occlusion and administration of the same dose of MnGlu/CaGlu demonstrated the region of hypoperfused myocardium in six dogs with a signal intensity ratio of hypoperfused to normal myocardium of 0.64 +/- 0.23 (p less than 0.05 versus control). When a higher dose of 0.1 mM/kg MnGlu/CaGlu was utilized and in vivo imaging was performed using a relatively spin-spin relaxation time (T2)-weighted (TR gated, TE 60 ms) spin-echo sequence in six dogs, the signal intensity of normal myocardium was decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, quantitative computer-assisted two-dimensional echocardiography was used to define the relation between infarct thickness and systolic function in the acutely and subacutely infarcted canine left ventricle. Echocardiograms were obtained at the mid-papillary muscle level at baseline and 6 h after occlusion (acute infarction) in eight animals and at baseline and 72 h after occlusion (subacute infarction) in nine animals. Systolic function was assessed by measuring the extent of fractional radial shortening along each of 36 evenly spaced endocardial targets from end-diastole to end-systole; the transmural extent of infarction was determined from the triphenyltetrazolium chloride-staining deficit at 6 and 72 h. The relation between systolic function and transmural extent of infarction was analyzed in two ways. First, the extent of fractional radial shortening in each group was examined as a function of quartile (25%) increments in transmural infarct thickness. This analysis revealed 1) a significant overall loss of fractional radial shortening with increasing transmural extent of infarction in both groups; and 2) significant differences in the extent of systolic dysfunction between successive quartile increments of infarction. Second, the relation between infarct thickness and systolic dysfunction was modeled mathematically by fitting the data from each infarct series to linear, logarithmic and exponential functions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Additionally, this study evaluated the response of three ventricular contractility indexes to both the pacing intervention and acute load alteration. The indexes compared were ejection fraction, peak systolic pressure to end-systolic volume index ratio (SBP/ESVI) and end-systolic wall stress to end-systolic volume index ratio (ESWS/ESVI). After 2 weeks of pacing at 265 +/- 20 min-1 (mean +/- SD), cardiac index and ejection fraction were reduced to 73 +/- 38 ml/kg per min and 22 +/- 6%, respectively, from 161 +/- 22 and 46 +/- 7 before pacing (both p less than 0.001). Concomitantly, SBP/ESVI and ESWS/ESVI were reduced to 34 +/- 10 mm Hg/ml per kg and 54 +/- 19 g/cm2 per ml per kg, respectively, from 84 +/- 29 and 121 +/- 36 before pacing (both p less than 0.005). There were high correlations for the changes in SBP/ESVI and ejection fraction (r = 0.94, p less than 0.001) and ESWS/ESVI and ejection fraction (r = 0.89, p less than 0.003). Acute afterload alteration with phenylephrine depressed ejection fraction but not SBP/ESVI or ESWS/ESVI. Therefore, this study demonstrates 1) that left ventricular contractility is markedly depressed in the dog by 2 weeks of rapid atrial pacing, and 2) that SBP/ESVI and ESWS/ESVI are superior to ejection fraction as ventricular contractility indexes because these ratios accurately measure contractility changes but are influenced less by after-load conditions.\r"

However, little is known regarding the hemodynamic benefit of differential AV delay intervals or the magnitude of difference between optimal AV delay intervals for paced and sensed P waves in individual patients. In this study, Doppler-derived cardiac output was used to examine the optimal timing of paced and sensed atrial events in 24 patients with a permanent dual chamber pacemaker. The hemodynamic effect of utilizing separate optimal delay intervals for sensed and paced events compared with utilizing the same fixed AV delay interval for both was determined. The optimal delay interval during DVI (AV sequential) pacing and VDD (atrial triggered, ventricular inhibited) pacing at similar heart rates was 176 +/- 44 and 144 +/- 48 ms (p less than 0.002), respectively. The mean difference between the optimal AV delay intervals for sensed (VDD) and paced (DVI) P waves was 32 ms and was up to 100 ms in some individuals. The difference between optimal AV delay intervals for sensed and paced atrial events was similar in patients with complete heart block and those with intact AV node conduction. At the respective optimal AV delay intervals for sensed and paced P waves, there was no significant difference in the cardiac output during VDD compared with DVI pacing. However, cardiac output significant declined during VDD pacing at the optimal AV delay interval for a paced event and during DVI pacing at the optimal interval for a sensed event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Among 51 patients with coronary artery disease, 31 (61%) had one or more shocks, whereas all seven patients with cardiomyopathy had one or more shocks (p less than 0.05). Neither of the two patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation had shocks. Of the 13 deaths, 12 occurred during post-hospital follow-up and 1 during the index hospitalization. Of the four sudden post-hospital deaths, only one was due to tachyarrhythmia in the absence of acute myocardial infarction. All four sudden deaths and five of eight post-hospital nonsudden deaths occurred in patients who had had one or more appropriate shocks during follow-up. Eight of the nine first appropriate shocks among patients who subsequently died occurred within the first 3 months of follow-up, but the actual deaths were delayed to a mean of 14.1 +/- 13.9 months (p less than 0.05). The mean time to all deaths was 14.8 +/- 13.1 months.

Simultaneous radionuclide angiography and micromanometer pressure measurements were obtained to assess left ventricular pressure-volume relations. Compared with control conditions, verapamil increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume index from 57 +/- 16 to 70 +/- 28 ml/m2 (p = 0.05) without a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (from 10 +/- 4 to 13 +/- 6 mm Hg). Despite a downward and rightward shift in the end-systolic pressure-volume relation indicating negative inotropic effects, ejection fraction did not decrease significantly (from 52 +/- 9% to 46 +/- 9%); cardiac index and stroke volume index remained unchanged. The change in stroke volume index with verapamil was directly related to the magnitude of change in end-diastolic volume index (r = 0.82, p less than 0.005), suggesting that the increase in end-diastolic volume did not arise purely from negative inotropic effects. Systemic vascular resistance index decreased from 42 +/- 8 to 34 +/- 7 mm Hg.min.m2/liter (p less than 0.05). In contrast, nitroprusside decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume index from 57 +/- 16 to 41 +/- 10 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05), cardiac index from 3.2 +/- 0.7 to 2.8 +/- 0.6 liters/min per m2 (p less than 0.05) and stroke volume index from 28 +/- 6 to 24 +/- 5 ml/m2 (p less than 0.01), with no change in systemic vascular resistance index (40 +/- 10 mm Hg.min.m2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The underlying coronary arteries were normal or near normal. Although multivessel spasm has previously been considered to be uncommon and its spontaneous occurrence during angiography only rarely documented, these cases suggest that it may be more common than previously recognized.

Six sera were obtained from workers exposed to storage mites and with occupationally related lower respiratory tract symptoms. All workers had specific IgE to D. pteronyssinus and to one or more of the storage mites. The pattern of reactivity varied between the different sera, two responded primarily to D. pteronyssinus and A. siro and four sera to D. pteronyssinus and G. destructor. Only weak responses were observed to T. longior. RAST-inhibition and affinity-absorption experiments demonstrated that D. pteronyssinus had at least three groups of distinct allergenic determinants, determinants specific to D. pteronyssinus, determinants shared with A. siro, and determinants shared with G. destructor. Similarly, both A. siro and G. destructor have specific allergenic determinants and determinants shared with D. pteronyssinus. The findings demonstrate the complexity of the immunologic responses to the different mite species.\r"

Levels of spontaneous proliferation (SP) were not significantly different among homosexuals or hemophiliac subjects when they were grouped as asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seronegative, asymptomatic seropositive, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome groups. There was, however, a stepwise increase in levels of SP corresponding with progression of disease in both patient groups. No correlations were noted between SP and CD8+ cell populations or mitogenic responses in study subjects, but SP correlated inversely to percentages and numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes. Depletion of CD4+ cells from mononuclear cell populations of HIV-infected subjects decreased SP. Thus, in HIV-1-infected subjects, SP increases as HIV-1-related disease progresses and appears to be CD4 dependent.\r"

During the grass-pollen season, the nasal epithelium of patients with an isolated grass-pollen allergy demonstrated significantly more CD-1-positive cells than before and after the season. Before and after the season, the number of CD-1-positive cells in epithelium of the allergic patients was not significantly greater than the corresponding number in epithelium of nonallergic subjects without nasal complaints.\r"

  ".W": "Clinicians frequently rely on serum theophylline concentrations (STCs) as an indicator of compliance for asthma medications. Most patients with good compliance do not have excessive fluctuations during routine STC monitoring. However, our experience is that in certain patients, persistently low or erratic STCs may be a sign of abnormal theophylline disposition. With careful analysis of theophylline absorption (STC every 2 hours for 24 hours after oral theophylline doses) and elimination (serial STC for 12 hours after an intravenous dose of aminophylline), we identified several patients with previously unrecognized anomalies of theophylline pharmacokinetics. These include (1) a 16-year-old girl with consistent temporal fluctuation in STCs during administration of a sustained-release formulation every 8 hours because of delayed absorption and enhanced elimination of theophylline at night, (2) a 13-year-old girl with markedly delayed absorption of a once-daily preparation administered in the evening, (3) a 5-year-old boy with erratic absorption of a liquid theophylline preparation with significantly increased STCs during the night, and (4) a 49-year-old man with 60% bioavailability of aminophylline tablets. Based on these observations, we suggest that clinicians carefully consider the possibility of abnormalities in theophylline disposition before assuming unexpected deviations in STCs are solely the result of noncompliance.\r"

Since the number expected by chance alone is 37, given that less than 6% of normal subjects have TA, the association is significant (p less than 0.01; chi-square test). Age and sex distribution was typical of patients with TA. Clinically, most patients suffered relentless and severe urticaria and/or angioedema. With the exception of thyroid function and thyroid antibody tests, other laboratory tests were not rewarding. In most cases, treatment with 1 thyroxine did not improve urticaria or angioedema, but a few patients demonstrated a dramatic response. Awareness of the association resulted in the identification of previously undiagnosed thyroid disease. The authors hypothesize that a subset of idiopathic chronic urticaria and angioedema may be an autoimmune disease.\r"

  ".U": "89327773\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of maternal and infant avoidance of allergenic foods on food allergy was examined in a prenatally randomized, controlled trial of infants of atopic parents. The diet of the prophylactic-treated group (N = 103) included (1) maternal avoidance of cow's milk, egg, and peanut during the third trimester of pregnancy and lactation and (2) infant use of casein hydrolysate (Nutramigen) for supplementation or weaning, and avoidance of solid foods for 6 months; cow's milk, corn, soy, citrus, and wheat, for 12 months; and egg, peanut, and fish, for 24 months. In the control group (N = 185), mothers had unrestricted diets, and infants followed American Academy of Pediatrics feeding guidelines. The cumulative prevalence of atopy was lower at 12 months in the prophylactic-treated (16.2%) compared to the control (27.1%) group (p = 0.039), resulting from reduced food-associated atopic dermatitis, urticaria and/or gastrointestinal disease by 12 months (5.1% versus 16.4%; p = 0.007), and any positive food skin test by 24 months (16.5% versus 29.4%; p = 0.019), caused primarily by fewer positive milk skin tests (1% versus 12.4%; p = 0.001). The prevalences of allergic rhinitis, asthma, and inhalant skin tests were unaffected. Serum IgE levels in the prophylactic-treated group were marginally lower only at 4 months. Thus, reduced exposure of infants to allergenic foods appeared to reduce food sensitization and allergy primarily during the first year of life.\r"

The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline 15% nonfat dry milk, incubated with dilutions of sera from atopic or control subjects, and probed with a radiolabeled or peroxidase-labeled antihuman IgE. The IgE binding bands were detected by autoradiography or enzymatic reaction; 45 to 50 protein bands were observed in silver-stained gels. IgE from 30 of the 38 sera tested from oak-sensitive subjects bound to 23 bands with molecular weights (MWs) between 106 to 108 kd (band 1) and 13.2 to 15.2 kd (band 23). No band was recognized by sera of every patient. Band 5 (MW 74.0 to 77.9 kd) and band 21 (MW 16.2 to 17.7 kd) were recognized by 71% of the patients' sera. Multiple bands were recognized by 30% to 50% of the sera tested. All patients who were skin test positive to oak by prick testing had positive immunoblots. Of 12 patients positive by intradermal skin testing, only four patients had positive immunoblots. The average number of allergens recognized by a single patient was 6.6. The maximum number of allergens to which any individual reacted was 18; the minimum number was one. Extracts separated under nonreducing conditions resulted in aggregates that did not enter the polyacrylamide gel. Of the protein that did enter the gel, the higher MW species elicited banding patterns similar to patterns observed under reducing conditions, whereas lower MW IgE binding bands were lost. These data suggest that the extractable proteins of white oak pollen contain multiple proteins that are potentially allergenic.\r"

The two groups had similar entry PEFRs and FEV1 (MPA, 112 L/min; 0.94 L, respectively; EPI, 111 L/min; 0.85 L, respectively) and similar plasma theophylline levels (MPA, 12.2 micrograms/ml; EPI, 13.8 micrograms/ml). PEFR and FEV1 were measured every 30 minutes for 4 hours. Mean expiratory flow rates among both groups were similar at entry and at 120 and 240 minutes. At 120 minutes, flow rates had improved in 28/46 MPA-treated patients (61%) and 48/54 EPI-treated patients (89%). Among these improved patients, flow rates were significantly higher in the MPA-treated group. At 120 minutes, 18/46 MPA-treated patients (39%) and 6/54 EPI-treated patients (11%) had PEFRs less than 120 L/min and PEFR and FEV1 less than 120% of baseline values (p less than 0.01). In 13 of these 18 MPA-treated patients who did not improve compared to 1/6 EPI-treated patients who did not improve, PEFRs were greater than 120 L/min, and PEFR and FEV1 had increased 20% or more above baseline values after treatment with the crossover comparison regimen (p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Challenge with 4.5% saline was found to have an accuracy of approximately 80%, compared to 90% for histamine and 80% for hyperventilation. The challenge test was well tolerated by all children. Increasing the dose of 4.5% saline delivered to the children by use of a nebulizer with a higher output improved the accuracy of challenge with 4.5% saline to approximately 90%. This finding suggests that the nebulizer output is an important determinant of the accuracy of bronchial challenge with 4.5% saline. Bronchial challenge with 4.5% saline appears to be a promising addition to the tests of bronchial responsiveness in children, but further studies, particularly documenting the reproducibility and the relationship to clinical asthma, are needed before it can replace the current standard tests.\r"

Although the number of drugs used did not increase significantly from admission to discharge (4.50 to 4.80, P = .128), the number of narcotics, laxatives, and antibiotics increased significantly. For those elderly subjects admitted to the hospital taking less than the average number of medications, the overall use of medication increased from admission to discharge (2.89 to 3.75, P less than .0001). These \"low users\" were discharged on more benzodiazepines, narcotics, laxatives, antibiotics, and cardiac medications. Our data suggest that during hospitalization admission medications are discontinued and new medications are started in large numbers and that these changes are accompanied by a tendency towards the increased use of certain categories of medications. These changes may place the elderly patient at increased risk of polypharmacy and its complications.\r"

The remaining 109 cases, none of which involved CPR, were studied. Documentation of discussions about CPR between physicians and residents or their surrogates was present in 90 charts. Of 85 residents with cognitive impairment, four were included in the CPR discussion and surrogates were consulted for 66. In 15, no discussion was documented. Of 24 residents without documented cognitive impairment, 11 were consulted. For nine others, surrogates were asked, and in four no discussion was recorded. One resident and three surrogates requested CPR. All others who were asked accepted a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. For 67 residents DNR orders were written. In six of these cases, physicians wrote the order without documenting consultation with resident or surrogate. For five residents orders to resuscitate (full code orders) were written. For 37 residents no order about CPR was recorded. Of the 42 residents who died without a DNR order, 37 were found dead by nursing staff, but in only one case was a physician contacted urgently. In this nursing home advance planning about CPR was frequently undertaken. Regardless of planning or the orders in the chart, CPR was a rare event.\r"

A management plan for urinary incontinence was determined for 264 elderly incontinent patients (205 females and 59 males) based on a clinical evaluation, simple tests of lower urinary tract function, and several criteria for referral for further evaluation derived from the literature on incontinence. Of the 264 patients, 168 (64%) also consented to undergo a urologic and formal urodynamic evaluation. Half of these 168 patients met at least one criterion for referral for further evaluation. At least one-quarter of the patients who met one or more of the criteria were found not to require surgical intervention, and probably did not benefit from the urologic and urodynamic evaluation. Among 84 patients who did not meet any of the criteria for referral, the urologic and urodynamic evaluation changed the initial treatment plan in only 10 (12%). The risks associated with the treatment plan based on the clinical assessment in these patients were, however, relatively small. While further refinement and testing in larger numbers of incontinent patients are needed, the data presented document that a substantial proportion of elderly patients with a treatable and often ignored problem can be appropriately managed based on a relatively simple and inexpensive assessment, which can easily be carried out in primary care settings.\r"

To determine the usefulness of this measure, we asked 67 Alzheimer patients and 83 normal controls to draw the face of a clock reading the time of 2:45. Six independent observers blindly evaluated the results with ratings from 10 (best) to 1 (worst). The mean performance score of Alzheimer subjects was 4.9 +/- 2.7 compared to 8.7 +/- 1.1 for normal controls (P less than .001). Inter-rater reliability for the clocks drawn by Alzheimer patients was highly significant (r = 0.86; P less than .001), and there was relatively little overlap between ratings for Alzheimer patients and normal controls. Furthermore, correlations were highly significant (P less than .001) between the mean score of clock drawings and three independent global measures of dementia severity. Although the Clock Drawing Test is certainly not a definitive indicator of Alzheimer's disease, the test is easy to administer and provides a useful measure of dementia severity for both research and office settings where sophisticated neuropsychological testing is not available.\r"

Clock drawings by patients with normal mental status or depression were essentially normal. Alzheimer's patients were unable to complete a normal clock and demonstrated five characteristically abnormal patterns. As a test for Alzheimer's disease, clock drawing had a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 92.7%. There was correct identification in 97.2% of normals.

  ".W": "Seventy-five patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were screened for binding of alpha 2 receptors (A2R) to their platelet membranes; the results were compared with 51 age- and sex-matched controls. Receptor binding assays were performed using [3H] Yohimbine as the radioligand. The results showed a higher binding capacity in the demented population as compared to the control group (2.18 +/- 0.15 fmol/mg protein, as compared to 1.73 +/- 0.13, P less than 0.03). This increased binding to platelets in the demented patients was more prominent in demented females: 34% higher binding as compared with female controls (2.06 +/- 0.5 vs 1.54 +/- 0.04). The difference between demented and normal males was less (2.34 +/- 0.05 vs 1.88 +/- 0.05). The results indicate an involvement of the A2R system, either primarily or secondarily, in the disease process. Since there is an overlap between results from the patients with Alzheimer's disease and the normal subjects, A2R may serve as only a supportive marker for Alzheimer's disease.\r"

In most of these patients quality of life, as measured by lifestyle and independence, improved after pacemaker implantation. None of these patients exhibited evidence of ischemic heart disease or cardiac failure. Because of increasing longevity and age-related degenerative and destructive changes in the conduction system and the sinus node, we expect that the number of patients requiring pacemakers in this age group will continue to grow. Ischemic heart disease as an underlying pathology necessitating pacemaker implantation appears to be rare in this age group.\r"

  ".W": "Although earlier debates had questioned the wisdom of treating hypertension in elderly patients, it is now becoming apparent that such treatment is warranted. Systolic hypertension, which prevails in this population, is more closely correlated to hypertensive complications than is diastolic blood pressure. Recent multicenter trials have demonstrated that in this age group, as in younger patients, control of hypertension can significantly decrease the rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Many effective antihypertensive agents are available today, but elderly patients, because of their hemodynamic and biochemical characteristics, are particularly vulnerable to the common side effects of most drugs. However, the two newer classes of drugs (the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the calcium channel blockers) offer several advantages in terms of favorable hemodynamic and biochemical profiles, convenience of dosing, and maintenance of quality of life. These characteristics justify choosing these agents as first-line therapy for hypertension.\r"

All ZES patients had hypergastrinemia and a positive secretin provocation test. In three ZES patients studied before gastric surgery, edematous or erosive changes were present in the second portion of the duodenum. In the seven ZES patients studied postoperatively, examination revealed erosive changes in the distal portion of the duodenum and/or upper jejunum. These changes were frequently in a line on the uppermost part of Kerckring's folds. In the non-ZES patients, however, endoscopy revealed no erosive change in the distal part of the duodenum. We propose that such linear erosions on Kerckring's folds may be diagnostic of ZES.\r"

In two Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) patients we assessed basal acid output (BAO) and 24-h pH under SMS and compared them to controls. We also assessed total gastrin, gastrin 17, insulin, glucagon, C-peptide, and SMS by radioimmunoassay. In the benign gastrinoma, an acid-controlling action of SMS was shown, elevating the 24-h pH threshold over the pH range 1.5-5 of 55-10% compared with control. A parallel inhibition of the gastrins greater than 90% was apparent. We found no beneficial effect on gastric acid secretion and on tumor gastrin in the malignant gastrinoma despite a fourfold higher plasma SMS level. Non-tumor-related peptides were suppressed by approximately 50% and in contrast to gastrin they again reached pre-SMS levels before the next dose of the drug. We conclude that SMS is more effective in benign than in malignant gastrinomas, and may be exclusively so.\r"

We studied 51 healthy volunteers, using the hydrogen breath test technique. All patients received 25 g lactose in aqueous solution. Subjects with an abnormal test had the test repeated with 500 ml whole cow's milk, whereas subjects with a normal test repeated the test after ingesting the unabsorbable sugar lactulose to detect the capacity of their colonic flora to produce the gas. Symptoms of gastrointestinal intolerance were also recorded. Compared to an equivalent lactose amount, milk lactose is better absorbed (8% of the entire population malabsorbed 500 ml whole milk, whereas 33.33% malabsorbed 25 g lactose) and induces intolerance in fewer subjects. We conclude that milk rather than pure lactose must be used in clinical evaluation of lactose malabsorption and intolerance.\r"

Each patient was assessed for the presence of skin tags. A screening flexible sigmoidoscopy was then performed without knowledge of the dermatologic findings. All polypoid lesions were recorded, and patients with polyps greater than or equal to 3 mm in diameter underwent full colonoscopy and polypectomy. Twenty patients (9.2%) had documented adenomatous polyps on colonoscopy. Nineteen other patients had hyperplastic polyps and mamillations. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of polypoid lesions in those with skin tags compared with those without skin tags, either analyzed as group totals or stratified by age, sex, or type of polyp. We conclude that skin tags are not associated with a higher than usual risk for colonic polyps and should not be used as a marker for more intensive screening.\r"

The Canadian health care system, which places no responsibility for payment on the patient, allows a unique opportunity to assess such factors when financial influences are minimized. We hypothesized that in such a milieu patients with functional diseases might be more apt to seek a second opinion. In a university-based gastrointestinal unit we investigated how many of the patients, referred for the first time, were seeking a second opinion--i.e., a second consultation within 2 years of seeing a gastroenterologist. We compared the characteristics of 20 patients with 246 patients referred for the first time to a university-based gastrointestinal unit. All patients were interviewed at clinic registration, prior to seeing the gastroenterologist. Variables assessed included demographic characteristics, health care utilization within the last year, and perceived health status. A second questionnaire was offered to second opinion patients to determine (1) reasons for seeking a second opinion, and (2) whose decision it was to seek the second opinion. Following the interview, the patient's referring physician was contacted and asked identical questions. Both referring physician and gastroenterologist assessed every patient on a functional rating (FR) scale of 1 to 5 (with 1 being definitely organic and 5 being definitely functional).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma FN levels showed significant negative correlation with serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase values in the FHF group (p less than 0.02) and with prothrombin time in the SAHF group (p less than 0.02). Serial estimation of plasma FN showed that failure of FN levels to rise despite fresh plasma infusions indicates poor prognosis in these patients.

Patients with endoscopically or radiologically confirmed peptic ulcers were more often males and smokers. They more often presented with typical symptoms and had higher total hospitalization rates than NUD patients. No differences were noted regarding age distribution or coffee or alcohol consumption.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that complement-binding antibasement membrane zone (BMZ) autoantibodies can mediate complement-dependent directed migration and adherence of leukocytes to the BMZ in cryostat skin sections and that there is heterogeneity in the ability of anti-BMZ autoantibodies to mediate that response. Those observations suggested that directed migration and adherence of leukocytes to the BMZ might be dependent on the amount of complement-activating autoantibody deposited at the BMZ and the extent to which those antibodies could activate complement and generate C5-derived peptides (C5a, C5a des arg). In this study, we have examined the role of autoantibody concentration and C5 in mediating the adherence response. When cryostat skin sections were pretreated with anti-BMZ autoantibodies and subsequently incubated with neutrophils suspended in fresh serum, neutrophils adhered to the BMZ. Adherence was anti-BMZ autoantibody specific and proportional to anti-BMZ autoantibody concentration. To determine the role of C5 in mediating adherence, neutrophils were suspended in increasing concentrations of: 1) fresh serum, 2) heat-inactivated serum, 3) serum pretreated with antihuman C5, 4) serum pretreated with antihuman IgG, 5) C5-depleted serum, 6) purified C5, and 7) C5-depleted serum reconstituted with increasing concentrations of purified C5. The suspensions were then incubated with autoantibody-treated skin sections. The results showed a dose-dependent requirement for fresh serum and for C5-depleted serum reconstituted with increasing doses of C5. Adherence could be detected with C5 concentrations less than 200 ng/ml, which correspond to a C5a/C5a des arg concentration of 10(-8)-10(-9) molar. These results suggest that complement-dependent neutrophil adherence is a highly sensitive method for detecting and quantitating the ability of tissue-deposited anti-BMZ autoantibodies to activate complement and generate C5-derived bioactive peptides, for estimating the amount of C-activating anti-BMZ autoantibody deposited at the BMZ in vivo, and for evaluating the potential role of C-activating anti-BMZ autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of lesions.\r"

The UVA-MED is significantly reduced after 12 months of treatment. The development of photosensitivity depends on the total dose of AD; 40 g is the minimal cumulative dose requirement. Under the regimens commonly used, photosensitivity can be expected after 4 months of continuous AD treatment and appears to be unrelated to the skin type. Photosensitivity gradually decreases and returns to normal between 4 and 12 months after the withdrawal of AD. AD-related hyperpigmentation develops after an average of 20 months of continuous AD treatment and a minimal total dose of 160 g AD in about 8% of the patients (mainly of skin type I). Electron microscopic examination of the sun-exposed skin of patients without AD discoloration shows pigment deposits similar to those already described in patients with AD hyperpigmentation in exposed and non-exposed skin. Light and electronmicroscopic examination of sun-exposed skin of both clinically photosensitive and non-photosensitive patients reveals perivascular inflammation even in the absence of a clinical rash. Reduplications of vascular basal laminae occur in sun-exposed skin of both patients with and without UVA photosensitivity but are absent from non-exposed skin. In one patient, followed for 33 months after drug withdrawal, massive AD-induced hyperpigmentation was found to be reversible.\r"

Recent work has described an early increase in type III collagen during chronic irradiation of hairless mice as determined by cyanogen bromide digests of whole skin. In order to understand the correlation of these events and those seen with histochemistry, in the present study we irradiated hairless mice for up to 24 weeks with approximately 4 minimal erythema doses (MEDs) of UVB thrice weekly with Westinghouse FS-40 bulbs. Skin samples were taken at 4-week intervals from irradiated and age-matched control mice. Collagen was isolated from other skin proteins by acid extraction, pepsin digestion, and salt precipitation. Estimates of types I and III collagen were made by interrupted polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and densitometric scanning. Compared with unirradiated controls, there was a small increase in the ratio of type III to total collagen after 8 weeks of UV. There were no significant increases at later time points until after 24 weeks of radiation. Total collagen in normal mouse skin, determined by hydroxyproline content, remained constant over the 24 weeks, while UV radiation produced significant increases at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks, returning to control levels at week 20. There was no change in the degree of hydroxylation at any time point in either group. Thus, chronic UV exposure resulted in increased collagen synthesis until late in the course of irradiation. Because there is a lack of consistent change in the ratio of type III to total collagen, the early increases in collagen content may represent both types I and III, synthesized in relatively unchanging proportions.\r"

IgE-bearing epidermal dendritic cells were present in patients with elevated IgE serum level (greater than 300 UI/ml) and the staining pattern was stronger in lesional skin. On double immunostaining, a subpopulation of CD1a+ LC/IC was found not to bear IgE molecules as determined by the ratio IgE+/CD1a+ cells on serial sections as well. The ratio IgE+/CD1a+ cells decreased in patients who underwent a local therapy with glucocorticosteroids. These results suggest that the expression of IgE receptors and/or binding of IgE molecules on epidermal LC/IC in atopic eczema may be controlled by a complex network of mediators from the epidermis or the inflammatory infiltrate, or both, and that this phenomenon could be down regulated by glucocorticosteroids.\r"

By week 7 all dogs developed generalized lesions distributed over the entire body. These occurred as irregular, oval, sessile, unpigmented, firm masses. The incidence and severity of the skin lesions varied among dogs and anatomic site, with no correlation to the blood level of cyclosporine. Microscopic analysis revealed that the epidermis formed short papillary folds on broad fibrovascular stalks and was hyperkeratotic and acanthotic. Mild hyperplasia of hair follicles and sebaceous glands was also evident. A mild diffuse infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells was present in the papillary dermis. No histopathologic changes typical of papillomavirus infection were identified, nor were papillomavirus group-specific antigens or viral DNA detected. Other cutaneous side effects included hyperkeratosis of footpads, increased growth of hair and nails, and hyperkeratinization of the haired skin of the prepuce. All cutaneous lesions regressed spontaneously within 8 weeks following termination of cyclosporine administration. The hyperplastic lesions may have resulted from the action of cyclosporine via the T-lymphocyte system. Conversely a direct action of this drug on epithelial cells may have stimulated proliferation and keratinization.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4,5-12-dihydroxy 6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid), an enzyme-catalyzed oxidation product of arachidonic acid, is a major inflammatory mediator. Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and rodent hepatic microsomes catabolize LTB4 to 20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4, which is mediated by a cytochrome P-450 catalyzed reaction termed the LTB4 omega-hydroxylase. In this study we investigated the catabolism of LTB4 in rat, guinea pig, and human epidermis. The incubation of 3H-LTB4 (9 microM) for 60 min in the presence of oxygen, NADPH, and epidermal microsomes prepared from neonatal fat (3.0 mg) or adult guinea pig (2.6 mg) resulted in the formation of 20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4. Metabolite identification was based on co-chromatography on high pressure liquid chromatography with highly purified reference standards. The formation of 20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4 was accompanied by the disappearance of LTB4. The rate of formation of 20-OH-LTB4 was 9-12-fold higher than that of 20-COOH-LTB4. Product formation was negligible with boiled microsomes, required NADPH and oxygen, was linear with respect to incubation time and protein, and was maximal at pH 7.4. LTB4-omega-hydroxylase activity was inhibited (greater than 90%) by carbon monoxide or 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride (SKF-525A) (1 mM), whereas alpha-naphthoflavone produced only moderate (13%) or no effects. Topical application of 3-methylcholanthrene and other conventional inducers of epidermal monooxygenase activities to neonatal rats (100 mg/kg, single treatment) did not result in an increase in epidermal LTB4-omega-hydroxylase activity. The addition of 3H-LTB4 (30 nmoles) to primary human keratinocytes followed by incubation at 37 degrees C resulted in time-dependent disappearance of LTB4 and appearance of 20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4 in the medium. These results suggest that LTB4 is catabolized by the cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme system in rodent and human skin and that this may participate in modulating the effects of this proinflammatory lipid in this tissue.\r"

Aluminum fluoride also caused a dose-dependent accumulation of inositol phosphates suggesting the participation of a GTP binding protein in the regulation of phospholipase C-catalyzed phosphoinositide hydrolysis.

Desmoglein I is a highly insoluble 160-kD transmembrane glycoprotein of the desmosomal core. The detailed immunochemical characterization of the epitope(s) recognized by the PF autoantibodies is hampered by its large molecular weight and the insolubility of desmoglein I in nondenaturing buffers. This study was designed to identify alternative methods that could yield soluble immunoreactive PF antigen (Ag) from normal human epidermis. The presence of PF Ag in human epidermis and in its soluble or insoluble fractions was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence, immunoadsorption of PF sera, and immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled fractions. The PF Ag from trypsin-resistant, radiolabeled cell envelope preparations was cleaved by papain and immunoprecipitated by PF sera. A 50-kD peptide, isoelectric at pH 5.5-5.8, was immunoprecipitated by sera from all patients with endemic PF (n = 15) or idiopathic PF (n = 4), and by two of four pemphigus vulgaris sera, but by no control sera (n = 7). This study shows that a significant fraction of the PF Ag is insoluble, trypsin-resistant, and is associated with the cornified cell envelope fraction, but an Ag fragment can be obtained in a small molecular weight, soluble, and immunoreactive form by papain digestion. This 50-kD papain fragment is more amenable to detailed chemical and immunologic characterization than the native molecule.\r"

The PC values were identical in untreated and delipidized stratum corneum, suggesting that the stratum corneum/water PC data reflect the protein domain rather than the lipids. Although uptake into human stratum corneum was relatively insensitive to solute lipophilicity, reflecting the predominant role of proteins in the uptake, permeability coefficients were found to be more sensitive to lipophilicity, suggesting that transport is by a lipid pathway. A log-log plot of kp versus stratum corneum/water PC within the phenol series is linear, but with a slope of 3.6, indicating that kp is not directly proportional to PC. Functional group contributions to the free energy of the transfer process reflected in permeability or partitioning experiments were compared with group contribution data generated previously for the same substituents attached to the chain terminus of 21-esters of hydrocortisone. Within experimental error, a given functional group altered permeability by the same factor in either series of compounds. Group contributions of polar, hydrogen bonding substituents obtained from kp data were similar to those from octanol/water PC data, suggesting that the barrier microenvironment resembles that of a hydrogen bonding organic solvent. Comparison of the kp values of substituted p-cresols with those of hydrocortisone esters having similar lipophilicities also indicated a steep dependence of kp on molecular weight (log kp = constant + psi log PC - n log MW, n = 4.6) similar to the dependence observed in other biomembranes and isolated lipid bilayers.\r"

We have recently identified a culture substrate containing basement membrane-derived proteins that promotes morphologic differentiation of human umbilical vein and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells into capillarylike tubes. This differentiation is rapid, beginning within 1 h and is complete by 8-12 h. On electron microscopy these cells form a lumen, derived from remodeling of multiple cells and also by forming holes in the cytoplasm of individual cells. The endothelial cells no longer proliferate when cultured on this substrate known as matrigel, but can be induced to do so when cultured on fibronectin. We have also identified a critical molecular signal for endothelial cell differentiation induced by matrigel. Laminin, a prime constituent of matrigel, and to lesser extent collagen IV appear to be key elements in the differentiation of endothelial cells induced by matrigel.\r"

Histologic examination of the six aldosterone-producing adenomas studied confirmed a predominance of cells resembling zona fasciculata rather than zona glomerulosa, as reported in previous studies. Measurement by radioimmunoassay of the tissue content of steroids preformed in vivo demonstrated that aldosterone was present in concentrations 8 times higher in aldosterone-producing adenomas (1.5 +/- 0.5 micrograms/gm tissue; mean +/- SEM) than in adrenal glands (0.2 +/- 0.06 micrograms/gm tissue). Cortisol concentration in aldosterone-producing adenomas (5.4 +/- 1.4 micrograms/gm tissue) was approximately one third that in adrenal glands (15.8 +/- 6.3 micrograms/gm tissue), but cortisol was by far the major steroid in both types of tissue. In vitro, the most important metabolic product quantitatively from 4-carbon 14-labeled cholesterol incubated with mitochondria plus microsomes and from 4-14C-labeled pregnenolone incubated with tissue slices was cortisol, formed in a time-dependent manner in both types of preparations; cortisol synthesis greatly exceed that of aldosterone in adrenal glands, but even in aldosterone-producing adenomas the formation of cortisol was at least 5 times greater than that of aldosterone. The fasciculata structure and dual biosynthetic capacity of aldosterone producing adenomas for cortisol and aldosterone are interpreted in the light of developing concepts of the roles of adrenocorticotropic hormone and of alterations in the microenvironment of the cell in the zonal differentiation of the normal adrenal cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Amiloride inhibits the proliferation of cells in tissue culture environments and diminishes compensatory hyperplasia of liver cells after partial hepatectomy. In the current study, we determined the extent to which amiloride diminished the compensatory increase in contralateral kidney weight and protein content after uninephrectomy. Caworth Farms mice, 3 to 4 months of age, received amiloride by daily intraperitoneal injection for 7 days before the left kidney was removed and for an additional 4 days after nephrectomy. Four days after uninephrectomy, compensatory hypertrophy was quantified by the increase in weight and protein content of the right kidney in comparison with the left (R - L divided by L x 100; [weight] +24.7% +/- 2.9% and [protein] +20.6% +/- 4.4%). Treatment with amiloride reversibly reduced the compensatory increase in kidney weight and protein content (dose required to achieve 50% inhibition, 11.4 and 2.4 mg/kg/day, respectively). Hexamethylene amiloride, an analog with weak affinity for conductive Na+ channels and high affinity for Na+-H+ exchangers, had no effect on compensatory hypertrophy. Spironolactone, a natriuretic and antikaliuretic agent of potency similar to that of amiloride, but with a different cellular mechanism of action, had no effect on compensatory hypertrophy. We conclude that amiloride reversibly blunts the compensatory renal hypertrophy after uninephrectomy in mice by mechanisms that appear to be separate from the drug's effects to block Na+-H+ exchange and transepithelial Na+ and K+ transport.\r"

We have found that blood PMNs from rabbits with chronic (2-week) experimental Staphylococcus aureus abscesses have decreased chemotaxis in response to an S. aureus supernatant (370 +/- 130 microns migration vs 570 +/- 180 microns, p less than 0.05) and decreased adherence (11.5% +/- 13.2% vs 32.9% +/- 18.6%, p less than 0.005) compared with PMNs from animals with acute (24-hour) abscesses. No differences were found in chemokinesis, random migration, and chemotaxis in response to zymosan-activated serum. No plasma inhibitors of PMN chemotaxis or inhibitors of chemotaxins were found. Although animals with chronic abscesses had higher levels of circulating chemotaxins, in both groups of animals abscess chemotaxin levels were greater than the plasma chemotaxin level. Animals with a concomitant chronic abscess had less PMN influx into an acute abscess but also less bacterial growth within the abscess than animals without a concomitant chronic abscess. We conclude that rabbits with chronic staphylococcal abscesses have decreased chemotaxis and adherence measured in vitro and decreased PMN localization in vivo. In this model, these functions were not associated with increased bacterial proliferation in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "We used a mailed questionnaire and telephone interviews with 1717 shopping center screenees whose total serum cholesterol was greater than 200 mg/dl. Our specific aim was to assess the subjects' motivations for participation in cholesterol screening, their follow-up outcome, their self-knowledge, and any coronary heart disease risk factor intervention. Of 1717 questionnaires mailed, 507 (30%) were returned; 64 of 100 subjects randomly selected for telephone interview could be contacted, and 61 were interviewed. Responses to the questionnaire and telephone interview were congruent, indicating little self-selection response bias. Before the cholesterol screening, 50% and 67% of questionnaire and telephone interview subjects knew their cholesterol levels. The nine most commonly cited reasons for cholesterol screening participation were: a desire to \"watch\" health (72%), convenience (70%), low cost (64%), to recheck previously measured total cholesterol (54%), publicity (34%), curiosity (30%), a relative with premature coronary heart disease (27%), the subjects' obesity (26%), and a relative's high cholesterol level (25%). As a result of cholesterol screening, 65% and 63% of questionnaire and telephone interview subjects, respectively, followed up with their doctors; 67% and 56%, respectively, had total cholesterol remeasured, but 17% and 18%, respectively, were told to \"do nothing.\" At their doctors' follow-up, 74% and 51% of questionnaire and telephone interview respondents, respectively, began a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet; 10% and 15% started taking a cholesterol-lowering drug. As a result of cholesterol screening, 76% and 85% of questionnaire and telephone interview subjects, respectively, changed their diets; 78% and 84% lowered their dietary cholesterol intakes, 62% and 74% increased their fiber intakes, 49% and 57% tried to lose weight, and 44% and 43% increased their exercise. Of questionnaire subjects, 94% thought that by lowering cholesterol, coronary heart disease risk could be reduced; 95% had become more aware of cholesterol in the last 5 years. Of telephone interview subjects, 91% concluded that cholesterol screening had motivated them to reduce cholesterol levels. Public cholesterol screening is convenient, inexpensive, facilitates self-knowledge about cholesterol, stimulates follow-up, and motivates physician and subject-guided dietary changes to reduce cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease risk.\r"

Only 12 of the 43 patients with an abnormal fluorometric screening test were found to have less than 3% GALT activity by quantitative assay, no GALT-staining by IEF, and a clinical history consistent with classical galactosemia. The majority of the remainder (24 of 43) were found to be heterozygotes for galactosemia, the Duarte variant, or both.

High-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection was used for the measurement of analytes. Dopamine concentrations were quite similar in the caudate and the adrenal medulla; epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were some 600 times and 90 times higher, respectively, than that of dopamine in adrenal medulla but were barely detectable in caudate nucleus. Catecholamines and metabolites were also measured, before and after transplantation, in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma 1 hour after the patients' first morning dose of L-dopa. The major fractions of the catecholamines in CSF were sulfoconjugated. The concentrations of sulfoconjugated but not free dopamine were modestly increased in CSF after the transplantation, although plasma concentrations were unchanged. CSF concentrations of free and conjugated norepinephrine and epinephrine, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, and homovanillic acid were unchanged after the transplantation. The data suggest that the grafted tissue does not retain its noradrenergic or adrenergic properties after transplantation, and that dopamine formation in the brain may be modestly increased. Plasma catecholamines were unaffected after the removal of one adrenal gland for the transplant.\r"

In the 149 phlebotomy sessions performed in these patients, a mean of 228 +/- 8 ml (mean +/- SEM) of whole blood was removed; it had a hematocrit value of 27.7% +/- 0.2%. The iron content of the erythrocytes removed (erythrocyte iron concentration, 787 +/- 11 micrograms/ml in 133 samples) accounted for more than 99% of the total iron removal by phlebotomy. Serum iron (serum iron concentration, 1.57 +/- 0.09 micrograms/ml in 65 samples) accounted for an insignificant fraction of the total iron removed. The iron removed at each phlebotomy session averaged 49.1 +/- 2.0 mg, similar to the amount of iron removed with deferoxamine administration in patients undergoing dialysis who had iron overload, but without the potential for adverse side effects reported with long-term deferoxamine therapy. Total iron removal during the 18 weeks of this study ranged from 732 to 2797 mg. Mean serum ferritin level decreased from 3189 +/- 1076 micrograms/L to 1676 +/- 342 micrograms/L (p less than 0.02, Wilcoxon signed rank test). When compared with a group of five patients without transfusional iron overload who received recombinant human erythropoietin and did not undergo therapeutic phlebotomy, the patients with iron overload had much greater iron losses and a larger decrease in serum ferritin levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Platelets have been implicated as mediators of mesangial cell proliferation. Of interest is a potential role for platelet secretory proteins (some of which are known to be growth factors) in proliferative glomerular disease. This study examines the effect of sulindac, an inhibitor of platelet thromboxane A2 generation and platelet activation, on the development of glomerular cystic and proliferative lesions after injection of habu snake venom (HSV). To examine the association of platelet secretory proteins with glomerular lesions after HSV, antiserum against a pool of platelet secretory cationic proteins (PSCPs) was used, by immunofluorescence, as a marker of the secretory component of platelet activation in platelet-compromised and normal rats. Uninephrectomized rats received sulindac (60 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle daily before and after HSV (2 mg/kg body weight, IV). Glomerular cysts, proliferative nodules, and mixed lesions (cystic plus proliferative) were quantitated and PSCP localization was examined 48 hours after HSV. Sulindac substantially reduced the total number of glomerular lesions and preferentially reduced proliferative lesions when compared with controls. PSCPs localized in glomerular lesions in both groups and paralleled the severity of disease, but overall intensity of PSCP staining was less in sulindac-treated rats. Sulindac did not alter renal function before HSV, ruling out hemodynamic factors. The concomitant localization of PSCPs in glomerular lesions and amelioration by antiplatelet therapy supports a role for platelet secretory proteins in this model of proliferative glomerular disease.\r"

These are: plain X-ray, conventional tomography, computerised tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR). Plain X-ray is the initial examination, and is used as a screening procedure before employing one of the tomographic techniques. Conventional pluridirectional tomography has now been superseded by CT scanning, which has the advantage of providing both good bone detail and soft tissue imaging. Since the introduction of magnetic resonance (MR), this technique has replaced CT as the optimum method of showing the extent of soft tissue tumour in the sinuses. The introduction of the paramagnetic contrast agent Gadolinium (Gd DTPA) has improved its accuracy. In the anterior fossa discrimination between cerebral oedema and tumour invasion is better shown, and in the sinuses tumour is more easily identified from retained secretion and inflamed mucosa. The best method currently available to show pathology in the nose and sinuses is a combination of GdMR and CT: the former to identify the soft tissues and the latter to show bone changes.\r"

When compared with adult temporal bones, the inclination of the tympanic ring remains unaltered throughout fetal development. Expansion of the middle ear cleft is caused by intrinsic growth and by lateral displacement of its constituent elements: tympanic ring, otic capsule and squamous bone. Not only are the two mutually different modes of growth movement quite dissimilar in magnitude and direction, but so is their resultant vector for each constituent; this dissimilarity in growth movement leads to a characteristic change in shape of the middle ear cleft and to curvature of the tympanic membrane. The intrinsic growth of these elements is simultaneously accompanied by remodelling of their shape; lateral displacement of the squamous bone and tympanic ring is caused by the pressure of the enlarging brain. The consequences of developmental disturbances on the normal growth pattern are discussed.\r"

The amiloride caused collapse of the lateral intercellular spaces in the endolymphatic sac epithelium and a subsequent mild endolymphatic hydrops. These changes indicated a decreased absorption of endolymph in the endolymphatic sac. Amiloride is known to inhibit the transcellular fluid transport without inducing any changes in the paracellular fluid transport. It is therefore suggested that amiloride specially inhibits the fluid and ion exchange in the apical portion of the epithelial cells resulting a decrease in transcellular fluid transport across the endolymphatic sac epithelium. The transcellular fluid transport seems to be one of the main mechanisms in the endolymphatic sac fluid exchange system.\r"

Those found to have a significant hearing impairment were prescribed hearing aids without formal pure tone audiometry. A pilot study compared the method of hearing evaluation employed with such conventional testing. Six months after fitting, the degree of compliance with aiding was assessed. The results show a significant level of undiagnosed deafness in the community and, with this method of provision, an acceptance rate of 41.2 per cent of those recommended for aiding at six months which is higher than suggested by previous similar studies of this population.\r"

Endoscopically 96.8 per cent of the antrostomies were patent and 94.7 per cent of the maxillary sinuses were clear and regained healthy mucosa. The author concluded that middle meatal antrostomy, when done endoscopically, is a safe procedure with good results.\r"

The endolaryngeal mucosa is tubed in continuity with the trachea below and projects into the pharynx above. Thus a myomucosal shunt is formed. Air is directed into it by finger occlusion of the tracheal stoma. The voice production is highly satisfactory. Aspiration is prevented by constriction of the thyroarytenoid muscle which provides a valved upper end of the tube. The possibility of leaving tumour in the laryngeal remnant is eliminated by careful selection of patients, and re-confirmation of tumour extent intra-operatively and a frozen section. Eleven such operations have been performed since October 1983 for squamous cell carcinoma, some previously irradiated. None of the patients had local recurrence. Only one had an aspiration problem which later resolved. All acquired a satisfactory voice.\r"

The first patient showed complete recovery of a sensorineural hearing loss averaging 50 dB after ten months treatment with cyclophosphamide and high-dose prednisolone. The second patient, who was on maintenance haemodialysis, achieved a 40 dB improvement in sensorineural hearing loss within two weeks of adding cyclophosphamide to pre-existing corticosteroid therapy. These findings suggest that the prognosis of sensorineural hearing loss in Wegener's granulomatosis can be improved with suppression of the vasculitic process by early treatment with combined cytotoxic-immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent to which lipid solubility and receptor selectivity are related to the occurrence of symptoms during ordinary beta-blocker treatment in out-patients. Two hundred and five patients (mean age 60 years) on beta-blockade were interviewed about their symptoms. Eighty-five per cent of the patients had been on beta-blocker treatment for more than 1 year. The blockers most commonly used were atenolol (51.0%), timolol (20.0%), propranolol (18.5%) and metoprolol (7.8%). beta-Blocker treatment was associated with a significantly increased frequency of central nervous system and peripheral symptoms. The increase in central nervous system symptoms was significantly smaller in those on beta-blockers with low rather than with intermediate (P = 0.015) or high lipid solubility (P = 0.007). The increase in peripheral symptoms was not significantly different with beta 1-selective and non-selective blockers. The results indicate that the liability of beta-blockers to cause side-effects on the central nervous system is determined partly by their lipid solubility, and that receptor selectivity has only a small impact on their tendency to cause peripheral side-effects.\r"

Forty-eight-hour Holter monitoring was carried out before cod liver oil administration and at the end of weeks 6 and 12. The eicosapentaenoic acid content of plasma phospholipids was increased by 230% during cod liver oil administration. However, no significant change was observed in the 24-h prevalence of ventricular extrasystoles or other arrhythmias during the study period. The mean ln number of ventricular extrasystoles was 2.95 +/- 0.51 (+/- SEM) during cod liver oil ingestion and 2.63 +/- 0.30 when not taking cod liver oil.\r"

Patients with retinopathy were younger at the onset of diabetes, and had a longer duration of disease. In patients with more than 10 years of diabetes, proliferative retinopathy was more frequent if onset was before they were 15 years old, despite the fact that the duration of diabetes did not differ. Patients with severe retinopathy had worse metabolic control, and were more frequently treated for hypertension. In addition, the systolic blood pressure was elevated in all groups of patients with any type of retinopathy, whereas the diastolic blood pressure was elevated only in patients with more severe forms. Patients with severe retinopathy also had higher levels of albumin clearance.\r"

To evaluate the mechanisms for this effect, simultaneous turnover rates for autologous and normal homologous LDL were determined in 12 patients with primary hypertriglyceridaemia. On average, the autologous LDL was cleared more rapidly than the normal homologous LDL. Fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) for autologous LDL averaged 0.61 +/- 0.06 (SEM) pools d-1, whereas FCRs for homologous LDL averaged 0.49 +/- 0.04 pools d-1. In eight of the 12 patients the FCRs for 'hypertriglyceridaemic' LDL were found to be significantly higher than for normal LDL; in four others both forms of LDL were cleared at essentially the same rate. In all cases, however, both for the normal and 'hypertriglyceridaemic' LDL, clearance rates were higher than normal. Thus, besides the variability in LDL affinity for removal pathways, hypertriglyceridaemic patients appear to have an increased availability of LDL receptors for removal of circulating LDL.\r"

Family physicians' responses to a questionnaire based, in part, on the Health Belief Model were compared with teenagers' responses about their knowledge, health beliefs, and preferred format and method of learning about AIDS. Results indicated that family physicians' predictions about teenagers' knowledge and beliefs about AIDS were not always accurate, but, except when physicians underestimated the teenagers' perceived obstacles to AIDS prevention, the data suggested that physicians would be effective in teaching teenagers about AIDS. Family physicians showed good agreement with teens in estimating their desired method and format for learning about AIDS, including their preference for a physician instructor.\r"

A higher proportion of family physicians in the West North Central census region have privileges at various levels of obstetric care than in other census regions. For those family physicians who do not have privileges for any obstetrics, most indicated that they chose not to include obstetric care in their hospital practices. Family physicians most likely to have obstetric privileges include those who practice in nonmetropolitan areas and those who have completed a family practice residency program. Although disparities in the proportion of family physicians with certain hospital privileges exist among regions, the majority in each region indicated that the privileges afforded them were appropriate.\r"

The five-year actuarial survival, disease-free survival, and local control of all 66 patients were 70%, 77%, and 63%, respectively. For patients undergoing local excision alone, the prognostic features of lesion size greater than 3 cm, poorly differentiated histology, invasion into muscularis propria or deeper, moderate to marked stromal fibrosis, vascular or lymph vessel invasion, fragmented resection, and positive resection margins were associated with a local failure rate of 20% or greater. Of the 26 patients receiving postoperative radiation therapy, four patients have developed local failure. For subgroups of patients with small rectal carcinomas confined to the mucosa, local excision may be a reasonable alternative to abdominoperineal resection. For tumors with deeper invasion but limited to the bowel wall, local excision plus pelvic irradiation can be offered to preserve anorectal function.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of second cancers (SCs) was assessed in 744 patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) admitted to The Netherlands Cancer Institute from 1966 to 1983. Sixty-nine SCs were observed one month or more after start of first treatment. These included 14 cases of lung cancer, nine cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 16 cases of leukemia, and six cases of the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The median interval between the diagnosis of HD and that of second lung cancer, NHL, and leukemia was 8.1, 13.3, and 5.7 years, respectively. The overall relative risks (RR) (observed/expected [O/E] ratios) of developing lung cancer, NHL, and leukemia were 4.9 (95% confidence limit [CL], 2.7 to 8.2), 31.0 (95% CL, 14.2 to 58.9) and 45.7 (95% CL, 26.1 to 74.2), respectively. At 15 years the cumulative risk of developing an SC amounted to 20.6% +/- 2.9%. The 15-year estimates of lung cancer, NHL, and leukemia were 6.2% +/- 1.9%, 5.9% +/- 2.1% and 6.3% +/- 1.7%, respectively. Increased lung cancer risk following HD has not frequently been clearly demonstrated before; that we were able to demonstrate such risk may be due to the completeness of follow-up over long periods that could be achieved in this study. Excess lung cancer risk was only noted in treatment regimens with radiotherapy (RT); also, all lung cancers arose in irradiation fields. Excess risk of leukemia was only found in treatment regimens involving chemotherapy (CT). For NHL, combined modality treatment was shown to be the most important risk factor. Risk of lung cancer and NHL increased with time since diagnosis. A time-dependent covariate analysis (Cox model) performed on leukemia and MDS showed an increasing risk with intensity of CT, age (greater than 40 years), and a splenectomy.\r"

These approaches included: (1) staging laparotomy followed by radiation therapy (RT) alone; (2) staging laparotomy followed by combined RT and chemotherapy (CMT); or (3) clinical staging followed by CMT. Patients treated with CMT were more likely to have \"B\" symptoms, extension into extranodal sites, or stage III disease. Patients treated with RT alone had a significantly higher risk of relapse as compared to patients receiving CMT. No overall survival differences were seen between the three groups of patients. For patients treated with CMT without RT to the spleen or abdominal nodes, the risk of relapse in the abdomen was low (4%). These data suggest that for those CS I-II HD patients with LMA who are treated with CMT, the role for staging laparotomy and abdominal irradiation is limited. RT alone remains an option for some patients with LMA, but careful assessment of the anatomic extent of thoracic disease as well as staging laparotomy is essential if such treatment is recommended.\r"

Twenty-three patients (53%) had loss of a sex chromosome and ten (23%) had other chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the 8;21 translocation. Complete remission (CR) with induction chemotherapy was achieved in 40 patients (93%). The median CR duration was 18 months (range, 1 to 137+ months). Median survival time was 17 months (range, 0.5 to 138+ months) with a 3-year survival rate of 31%. Twenty-three patients (53%) relapsed between 1 and 58 months after entering remission with reinduction therapy resulting in 8 CRs (35%). Thirteen characteristics were examined for an effect on survival. The most striking finding was a significant association between elevated absolute granulocyte count and poor survival (P = .002). WBC count greater than 10,000/microL was also associated with shorter survival (P = .05). Patient age, albumin level, and platelet count showed trends for survival association. Although patients with AML and t(8;21) are regarded as a favorable group with respect to survival, we found a subset of patients who do very poorly. Intensive or more investigational approaches in first remission should be considered for these patients.\r"

The inferior survival of patients with GE-cardia lesions as compared with patients with tumors located in the body and antrum has been attributed to anatomic features. To determine if a biological difference could explain the varying prognosis, flow cytometric studies were performed prospectively in 50 patients with operable gastric cancer and analyzed for association with site, histology, gender, age, stage, and disease-free survival. DNA aneuploidy significantly correlated with tumor location: 96% of GE-cardia carcinomas were aneuploid as compared with 48% of body-antrum tumors (P = .0008). Nodal involvement was more common in aneuploid tumors (P = .0548), and women were more likely to have diploid tumors than were men (P = .0233). The median disease-free survival for patients with diploid tumors was 18.5 months as compared with 5.4 months for patients with aneuploid carcinomas (P = .076). Furthermore, within the body-antrum of the stomach, patients with diploid tumors had a significantly better disease-free survival than did those with aneuploid tumors from the same site (18.4 v 4.7 months, P = .0185). These results indicate there is a difference in the DNA content of gastric tumors located in different sites within the stomach and that DNA content correlates with prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Amplification of the HER-2/neu oncogene was recently reported to predict poor clinical outcome in node-positive breast cancer patients. Since expression of the oncogene as its protein product might be even more closely related than gene amplification to disease progression, we have now examined levels of the HER-2/neu oncogene protein for its prognostic potential in both node-positive and node-negative breast cancer. Using Western blot analysis, levels of this protein were determined in 728 primary human breast tumor specimens. We examined relationships between this protein and other established markers of prognosis, as well as clinical outcome. In node-negative patients (n = 378), the HER-2/neu protein failed to predict disease outcome. However, in node-positive patients (n = 350), those patients with higher HER-2/neu protein had statistically shorter disease-free (P = .0014) and overall survival (P less than .0001) than patients with lower levels of the protein. Higher HER-2/neu protein was found in tumors without estrogen receptor (ER) (P = .02) or progesterone receptor (PgR) (P = .0003), and in patients with more than three positive lymph nodes (P = .04). A significant correlation between levels of the HER-2/neu gene protein and amplification of the gene itself was also found (n = 48, P less than .001). Multivariate analyses in these patients showed that the HER-2/neu protein is a significant independent predictor of both the disease-free and the overall survival in node-positive breast cancer, even when other prognostic factors are considered.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple drug resistance (MDR), consisting of acquired cross resistance to anthracyclines, vinca alkyloids, and other antineoplastic antibiotics, has been described in a variety of cell lines. This MDR phenotype is associated with overexpression and sometimes amplification of a gene coding for a 170 kDa glycoprotein, termed P-glycoprotein. To understand the role of this mechanism in clinical breast cancer, 248 breast cancer specimens representing both untreated primary and refractory relapsing disease were probed for evidence of P-glycoprotein gene amplification or overexpression using Southern, Northern, or Western blot techniques. In no case was an increase in P-glycoprotein gene copy number or expression detected. Though these findings do not necessarily rule out a role for P-glycoprotein in mediating drug resistance in breast cancer, electrophoretic analysis of clinical specimens is unlikely to provide useful predictive information. More sensitive assays must be developed to overcome the difficulties inherent in analyzing heterogenous tissue samples.\r"

An additional five patients were treated with 0.18 mg/kg given three times at six-hour intervals. Excellent antiemetic efficacy was noted, with 44% of patients experiencing no vomiting and 26% no nausea. Major protection from vomiting (less than or equal to 2 episodes) and from nausea (less than or equal to 2 hours) was experienced by 81% and 44%, respectively. Mild to moderate headache (40%), lightheadedness (21%), and elevated transaminase (19%) were the most common adverse events reported. One patient experienced an apparent hypersensitivity reaction that responded to conventional medications. No extrapyramidal reactions or akathisia were seen. GR38032F was effective through most of the dose range. However, efficacy decreased at the 0.01 mg/kg level and number and intensity of adverse events increased at the 0.48 mg/kg level. Analysis of those patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (100 to 120 mg/m2) revealed a positive association of GR38032F dose and antiemetic activity (Fisher's exact test, two-sided; P less than .05). The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may provide antiemetic efficacy similar to high-dose metoclopramide without antidopaminergic toxicity. The maximum recommended dose on this schedule of GR38032F is 0.36 mg/kg.\r"

The results included success rate, failure, and complications, and were determined by a review of patient charts, surgical results, and autopsy results. The 20-gauge needle aspirations were accurate in suggesting the diagnosis in 20 of 22 cases of metastatic disease and ten of 15 cases of lymphoma. Using the 20-gauge needle, it was not possible to make a specific diagnosis in any of the lymphoma patients or for unusual benign disorders. With the 14-gauge Tru-Cut needle, the correct diagnosis was made in 13 of 13 cases of metastatic disease, ten of 11 cases of lymphoma, and two of 2 cases of unusual benign disorders. It was also possible to make the specific diagnosis of the lymphoma type in ten of 11 cases. The only complication was a small subcutaneous hematoma following a biopsy with a 20-gauge Chiba needle.\r"

Complexes were observed in all patients using size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography and complex formation was partially blocked by nonspecific murine antibody, suggesting the presence of human anti-murine antibody in serum. All patients subsequently underwent imaging studies with [131I] 9.2.27 given intravenously. The serum levels of the antibody obtained after the second administration were inversely correlated with the level of in vitro complex formation. Patients whose serum formed high levels of complex showed a rapid serum clearance, high hepatic uptake, and accelerated whole body clearance and urinary excretion of 131I. This suggests that in patients who receive repetitive administration of murine antibody the serum clearance rate and biodistribution of intravenously injected antibody are altered by antibody complex formation in the serum.\r"

Technetium-99m leukocyte scintigraphy has a promising future in comparison with [67Ga]citrate because of the ready availability of [99mTc]HM-PAO, the good image quality, more rapid results (within few hours), and the lower radiation exposure to the patient with 99mTc leukocytes. The usefulness of 99mTc leukocytes in chronic osteomyelitis needs further evaluation.\r"

The B72.3-MT conjugate was studied at three doses of B72.3 ranging from 0.03 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg to determine whether a relationship existed between the dose of total antibody administered intravenously and the biodistribution and clearance of the radiolabeled protein. Results indicated that [Tc]MT-B72.3 distributes rapidly to central body cavity organs and that there was no difference in the rate of blood elimination for the three doses of B72.3 studied. The terminal phase of blood elimination was found to be 26.2 +/- 6.1 hr for the combined groups of monkeys. Approximately one-half of injected 99mTc activity was recovered in the urine within 24 hr. A second purpose of these studies was to evaluate the overall immunogenicity of the mouse monoclonal B72.3 IgG1 antibody in Rhesus monkeys. These results demonstrated that a single i.v. exposure to mouse monoclonal B72.3 at doses of 0.3 mg/kg or greater elicited antibody production to B72.3 in Rhesus monkeys within 3 wk. Analysis of [Tc]MT-B72.3 biodistribution and clearance in monkeys with circulating levels of antibodies to B72.3 (immunized monkeys) revealed that the liver was the primary site of clearance of the presumed immune complex and that blood elimination was greatly accelerated.\r"

A single source of 90Y (beta-ray range less than or equal to 1.0 cm) was inserted in the bladder region and dosimeters were placed at distances greater than or equal to 3 cm to preclude detection of decay betas. Doses were corrected so as to represent the case of no biologic clearance. By comparing dosimeter location with the standard MIRD human geometry, sample organ doses could be determined. Representative results were 432 +/- 76 mrad/mCi at 3 cm (bladder), 260 +/- 60 mrad/mCi (uterus), 71 +/- 4 mrad/mCi (lower large intestine), and 1.4 +/- 0.7 mrad/mCi (liver). An estimation method, based on absorbed fraction tables, gave organ doses that were within the errors of measurement for all tissues with the exception of the bladder site. We conclude that organ bremsstrahlung radiation doses are not negligible and that they can be estimated using an integration over both the brake and beta-ray spectra.\r"

In this study, a general data processing procedure is presented that allows inter-individual comparison and definition of normal count density pattern of unevenly shaped scintigraphic structures. This new method is demonstrated on Fourier amplitude images of gated heart studies. The information contained in the original irregularly shaped left ventricular amplitude scans was transformed into a standard sized circle by interpolating the radiant profiles of varying length from the original left ventricular ROI into the radii of the standard circle using 720, 360, 180, and 72 sampling angles. Retransformation of the individual left ventricular amplitude image from the standard circle area is feasible with only approximately 1% error with the 180, 360, or 720 sampling steps. As a first application of this new method 20 normal amplitude studies were transferred into the standard circle, which allowed the definition of a statistically normal reference image against which individual left ventricular amplitude images may be compared for documenting areas of significantly depressed amplitudes quantitatively. This simple and unique approach may be applied to most organ-related scans such as brain, kidneys, lung, and liver both in planar and tomographic studies to first create a normal reference image and second, to quantify the significance of locally increased or decreased activity in routine scans automatically.\r"

Continuous and dynamic monitoring of injected radiolabeled Ivalon particles is made possible by viewing the persistence scope of a portable gamma camera whose head is positioned over the patient undergoing therapeutic embolization. Therefore, if inadvertent pulmonary embolism or reflux migration of radiolabeled Ivalon particles has occurred, the angiographer is immediately aware of this potentially serious or fatal complication and can take corrective action. We describe two patients, each with an arteriovenous malformation, who had therapeutic embolization with radiolabeled Ivalon particles, one resulting in reflux migration and the other resulting in inadvertent pulmonary embolism.\r"

Increased dietary methionine caused decreased selenium deposition in all tissues examined but increased glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx, EC 1.11.1.9) activity in testes, liver and lungs. A positive correlation was found between dietary methionine and the calculated percentage of selenium associated with GSHPx. In a second experiment, 75SeMet was injected into weanling male rats which had been fed the basal diet containing 2.0 micrograms selenium as DL-SeMet with or without the addition of 1.0% methionine. The selenoamino acid content of tissues and the distribution of 75Se in erythrocyte proteins were determined. In comparison to the rats fed the basal diet without added methionine, significantly more 75Se-selenocysteine was found in liver and muscle, more 75Se was found in erythrocyte GSHPx and less 75Se was found in erythrocyte hemoglobin of rats fed 1.0% methionine. These data suggest that methionine diverts SeMet from incorporation into general proteins and enhances its conversion to selenocysteine for specific selenium-requiring proteins, such as GSHPx.\r"

Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma and liver 105,000 x g supernatant was measured for comparison. Weanling male rats were fed a selenium-deficient diet or a control diet that contained 0.5 mg selenium/kg as Na2SeO4. The concentration of selenoprotein P fell at approximately the same rate in the rats fed the selenium-deficient diet as did plasma glutathione peroxidase activity. Groups of weanling rats were fed different levels of selenium for 8 wk. Selenoprotein P concentration was proportional to dietary selenium level up to 0.1 mg/kg and was a greater percentage of control values than was glutathione peroxidase activity. No increment in selenoprotein P concentration occurred between 0.1 and 0.5 mg selenium/kg diet. These results indicate that the concentration of selenoprotein P in the plasma is directly dependent on selenium supply in the diet up to 0.1 mg/kg. There is overlap between the dietary selenium ranges in which selenoprotein P concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity increase, but the selenoprotein P range is lower than the glutathione peroxidase range.\r"

One-d-old chicks and 7-wk-old male rats were fed diets supplemented with synthetic all-trans-beta-carotene or dry D. bardawil at equivalent levels of beta-carotene. The chicks were fed diets containing up to 0.025% beta-carotene for 2 mo, and the rats up to 0.1% beta-carotene for 2 wk. Liver analyses at the end of these periods indicated that both species showed at least a tenfold higher accumulation of the algal beta-carotene isomer mixture than of the synthetic all-trans-beta-carotene. The ratio of 9-cis-beta-carotene to the all-trans isomer in the livers of the algae-fed rats and chicks was similar to or higher, respectively, than that present in the algae. Retinol plus retinyl ester accumulated to a similar extent in the rats and chicks fed diets supplemented with synthetic all-trans or the natural isomer mixture of beta-carotene. The preferable accumulation of the natural isomer mixture of beta-carotene suggests that attention should be paid to the different sources of beta-carotene when testing their efficacy in effects other than providing retinol, such as in their possible role in the prevention of some types of cancer.\r"

Daily body weight gain, food intake, weekly plasma free amino acids, plasma B-6 vitamers, urinary oxalate excretion, hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit were measured. Kittens fed a -PN diet had depressed body weight gain, food intake, plasma pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxal (PL), Hb and hematocrit, and had elevated urinary oxalate, plasma tyrosine and plasma cystathionine. In a second experiment, 24 kittens were given a -PN diet for 45 d to deplete their body reserves. The kittens were then divided into six groups of four kittens each and given a purified diet containing either 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 or 8.0 mg PN/kg diet for 46 d. Following supplementation, positive responses in body weight gain, PLP, Hb and hematocrit, and decreased urinary oxalate excretion, plasma tyrosine and plasma cystathionine occurred in all groups except those fed 0.5 mg PN/kg diet. At the end of the repletion period, kittens fed 1.0 mg PN/kg diet had lower body weight gain, higher plasma tyrosine and cystathionine, slower rate of decrease in urinary oxalate, and lower values for Hb, hematocrit and PLP than did the kittens from groups fed 2.0-8.0 mg PN/kg diet. These findings indicate that the dietary requirement for PN is greater than 1.0 mg/kg diet, but 2.0 mg PN/kg diet is adequate for growing kittens given a 35% casein diet.\r"

Seven groups of ddY male mice were fed for 75 d purified diets with a range of 15-70% protein concentration, calculated on a gross energy basis. The food intake and body weight data were analyzed by nonlinear regression to Parks' feeding and growth equation, and data of body protein (%) and body energy (kcal/g) were analyzed using stepwise multiple regression. Body protein (approximately 17%) was independent of both dietary protein level and age. Body energy, as a function of time after weaning, increased to a plateau at about 30 d after weaning. At every dietary protein level the accumulation of body protein and energy increased with age asymptotically to a plateau at approximately 40 d and approximately 30 d after weaning, respectively. At every dietary protein level, the protein accretion rose rapidly with age to attain a maximum at about 7 d after weaning, when it depended on the dietary protein level, then decreased markedly to where differences due to dietary protein level became negligible. It is clearly shown in this study that manipulation of dietary protein level has a greater effect on protein growth and energy gain during the pre-peak part of the body protein accretion and body energy accretion curves than during other portions of those curves.\r"

Small intestinal absorption, based on xylose absorption tests, was greater in calves fed MPR than in those fed SPC (P less than 0.01) and was intermediate in SPP- and SPE-fed calves. Small intestinal segments were surgically excised from the proximal and distal jejunum of all calves at 7, 14 and 21 d of age. Villus length tended to be greatest in calves fed MPR, and mitotic index was least in SPC-fed calves (P less than 0.05). Mucosal protein concentration was 46, 41, 44 and 44 micrograms/mg mucosa for calves fed MPR, SPC, SPP and SPE, respectively. The ratio of mucosal protein:RNA was greatest in calves fed MPR, least in those fed SPC at d 7 (P less than 0.01) and d 14 (P less than 0.05), and intermediate in calves fed SPP and SPE. In proximal jejunum, activity of mucosal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, EC 4.1.1.17; the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis) in calves fed SPP was less than 50% of that in calves fed MPR, SPC or SPE. The activity of lactase (EC 3.2.1.108) and ODC in distal jejunum was 50% less in calves fed soybean protein than in those fed MPR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine the effect of prolonged ingestion of acetaminophen (ACAP) on the availability of methionine for its metabolic functions in mice. ACAP was fed to weanling mice at levels of 0.0, 0.3, 0.5 or 0.8% of the diet, with methionine provided at requirement (0.5%) or at twice the requirement (1.0%) level, for 2 wk to assess its effect on the availability of methionine for growth. In another study, ACAP was fed to adult mice at levels of 0.0, 0.4, or 0.6% of the diet, with methionine at 0.5 or 1.0% of the diet, for 2 wk to assess its effect on the availability of methionine for protein synthesis and methylation reactions. The growth rate of weanling mice decreased with increasing dietary ACAP in mice fed 0.5% methionine, but not in those fed 1.0%. Hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) decreased and plasma glutamic-pyruvic transaminase activity increased in an ACAP dose-dependent manner in weanling mice fed 0.5% methionine. Protein synthesizing ability decreased in adult mice fed 0.5% methionine and 0.6% ACAP. Relative liver weight and liver lipid decreased with increasing dietary ACAP in mice fed methionine at or above requirement. Neither plasma creatinine or muscle creatine was affected by variations in dietary methionine or ACAP. Ingestion of ACAP for a prolonged period of time increased the methionine requirement for growth, maintenance of hepatic GSH level and protein synthesis, but did not affect the methionine requirement for methylation reactions.\r"

In the first study four groups were fed either a diet containing skim milk (SM) powder or whole milk (WM) powder or one of two control diets with casein as the protein source. The SM diet and one casein diet (SM control) each contained 5% fat by weight as corn oil. The WM diet contained 20% fat by weight, derived from the milk powder, and the second casein diet (WM control) contained 20% fat by weight from corn oil and lard. The SM group had similar plasma and hepatic lipids, as did the SM control group; plasma apolipoprotein AI, AIV and B did not differ between the groups, but the apo E level was lower in the control group. The WM group had lower plasma triacylglycerides and apo B and lower hepatic cholesterol and triacylglycerides than did the WM control group. In the second study the WM diet was fed again, and the two control diets contained casein as the protein source, 20% butter oil (so that the level of dietary fat was comparable to that of the WM diet), and either lactose or sucrose was added. The plasma apo B and triacylglycerides and the hepatic cholesterol and triacylglycerides were significantly lower in the WM group than in the casein/lactose or casein/sucrose groups. The amount of protein, cholesterol and triacylglycerides in the VLDL fraction of the plasma was lower in the WM group than in the casein/lactose or casein/sucrose groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Leucrose [D-glucosyl-alpha(1----5)-D-fructopyranose], prepared by an enzyme-catalyzed transglycosidation from sucrose with greater than 99% purity, has previously been shown to be noncariogenic and was found in the present study to be apparently easily digestible when given to humans as a single oral dose of 100 g, or when fed to rats at a level of 35 g/kg body wt daily. Weanling rats fed a 25% leucrose diet grew as well as rats fed a diet containing 25% sucrose or corn starch. When 1 g of leucrose was given intravenously to adult rats, 70% of this disaccharide was excreted in the urine within 24 h, and feeding and drinking behavior of the rats was not altered. No adverse effects on their general health were observed. The substrate properties of leucrose for alpha-glucosidase from yeast and for carbohydrases from human jejunal mucosa were determined, and these data were then compared with those of maltose and sucrose. The cleavage rate of leucrose in vitro by human digestive carbohydrases was 31% that of maltose and 63% that of sucrose. Hydrogenated leucrose (leucritol) was cleaved 10 times slower, with a Michaelis constant close to that of leucrose. Blood glucose and fructose profiles in humans given leucrose per os tended to be lower than those in humans given sucrose, while insulin and C-peptide profiles were unaltered.\r"

Three groups of African green monkeys were fed for 3.5 yr purified diets containing 9.7% cellulose or psyllium husk and 0.8 mg cholesterol per kcal or 9.7% cellulose and 0.1 mg cholesterol per kcal. Total viable anaerobe and aerobe counts, microbial beta-glucuronidase activity, volatile fatty acid and ammonia nitrogen concentrations, dry matter and pH were determined in fecal and colonic samples. Compared to cellulose, psyllium husk feeding decreased (P less than 0.05) percentage dry matter, beta-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) activity and pH, and increased (P less than 0.05) ammonia nitrogen and volatile fatty acid output in feces and in colon contents. In all groups, colonic beta-glucuronidase activity was greater (P less than 0.05) than in fecal samples. Microbial beta-glucuronidase activity, pH or percentage dry matter in the ascending colon was not different from that in the transcending or descending segments. The ratio of anaerobic to aerobic bacteria was lower in colon contents from monkeys fed psyllium husk compared to those fed cellulose. Total viable bacterial counts were lower in monkeys fed low cholesterol compared to high cholesterol diets. The results suggest that chronic intake of dietary psyllium husk resulted in greater colonic microbial metabolism compared to cellulose feeding.\r"

Older white children (11 to 17 years) with a parental history of heart attack or diabetes were 4.3 and 5.6 times, respectively, more likely to have high levels (greater than or equal to 95th percentile) of serum total cholesterol than those without such a history (all p less than 0.05). White children with a parental history of heart attack or diabetes were twice as likely to have an elevated (greater than or equal to 95th percentile) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level than those without such a history (both p less than 0.05). In contrast, parental history of cardiovascular disease did not predict elevated levels of total cholesterol or LDL-C in black children. However, older black children with a parental history of heart attack, hypertension, or diabetes were 4 1/2 to 5 times more likely to have low levels (less than or equal to 5th percentile) of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than those without such a history (all p less than 0.05). Only 40% of white children and 21% of black children with elevated LDL-C levels had a parental history of vascular disease. These findings raise questions about the current practice of screening only children with a family history of cardiovascular disease to identify those with elevated total cholesterol and LDL-C levels.\r"

In two separate primer pairs, HIV-1 proviral DNA gag sequences were successfully identified in cell lysates from seven patients, including two infants with previously indeterminate HIV-1 status on the basis of serologic and culture results. In the remaining 18 patients the polymerase chain reaction was negative for HIV-1. Simultaneously grown HIV-1 cultures concurred with polymerase chain reaction results for all patients. In an 18-month-old infant who had had a single HIV-1 positive culture at 1 month of age with four subsequent negative cultures, both polymerase chain reaction and HIV-1 culture were negative. Our data demonstrate the clinical applicability of polymerase chain reaction on crude cell lysates for the rapid, early, definitive detection of HIV-1 infection in high-risk infants and children.\r"

With the child anesthetized in the operating room, a second contrast enema was given before laparotomy. Of the 31 intussusceptions, 21 (68%) were reduced without complication, thereby avoiding the discomfort, longer hospitalization, complications, and expense of surgery. Nine of the remaining 10 intussusceptions were difficult to reduce manually during surgery or required resection. The overall nonoperative reduction rate for the 3-year period was 84%; for the last 2 years it was 90%. Success with the second enema may be related to the effects of general anesthesia. In addition, partial reduction with the first enema may improve blood flow from the intussusceptum so that it becomes smaller and easier to reduce with the second enema. Because it can easily be added to standard management protocols without increased risk, routine use of this second enema with anesthesia is recommended.\r"

A comparative study of these patients with those whose cases were recently reported indicates that there is a wide variability of clinical and laboratory expression of the dystrophy, but a constant feature in all patients is a progression of motor disability. The association of congenital muscular dystrophy with brain abnormalities indicates a poor clinical prognosis. At present it remains an open question whether the three variants of the disease are separate diseases or only different expressions of the same syndrome, but our study tends to support the latter hypothesis.\r"

The mean (+/- SD) glomerular filtration rate was high at the start of the study (133 +/- 18 ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface area) and decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) to within normal values after 1 year of essential fatty acid supplementation. The urinary elimination of an oral sodium load initially was very low (3.6 +/- 2.5 mmol/hr/1.73 m2 body surface area vs control subjects' values of 7.9 +/- 2.0; p less than 0.001) and increased during treatment but was not normalized (p less than 0.05 vs control subjects' values). Free water clearance and distal tubular sodium delivery, which were significantly decreased before treatment (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001 vs control subjects' values, respectively) did not increase significantly. The mean urinary aldosterone excretion did not significantly differ from that in control subjects before and after treatment. The acidifying capacity was disturbed, indicating a low renal bicarbonate threshold, and was changed during treatment in only 2 of 10 patients. These data indicate that essential fatty acid deficiency may contribute to the renal disturbances in cystic fibrosis.\r"

Significant cognitive deficits were not observed in patients with normal growth patterns, except for one patient with profound mental retardation. The magnitude of the cognitive deficits was closely correlated with the degree of growth failure (p less than 0.001).

  ".U": "89328704\r", 
  ".W": "We hypothesized that changes in brain-stem auditory evoked responses related to bilirubin would be associated with changes in cry because of the anatomic proximity in the brain stem of cranial nerves 8 (auditory) and 9 to 12 (vagal complex, which controls cry). Brain-stem auditory evoked responses and computerized cry analysis were used to study the concurrent effects of moderate hyperbilirubinemia on auditory function and cry. Fifty term infants were divided equally into two groups on the basis of serum bilirubin concentrations: low (less than 8 mg/dl; 136) mumol/L and moderate (10 to 20 mg/dl, 170 to 342 mumol/L). Forty-three infants had successful tracings of brain-stem auditory evoked responses recorded with a Cadwell model 5200A evoked response unit during two successive trials, and a cry recording of each infant was analyzed by computer. The moderate serum bilirubin group had an increase in percent cry phonation (p less than 0.02) and an increase in the variability of the first formant (p less than 0.04) in comparison with the low serum bilirubin group. Serum bilirubin values correlated positively with brain-stem conduction time (r = 0.36, p less than 0.01), percent phonation (r = 0.42, p less than 0.004), and variability of the first formant (r = 0.39, p less than 0.02). Percent phonation, the voiced component produced by increased neural control, correlated with the interpeak of waves latencies I to III (r = 0.32, p less than 0.03) and brain-stem conduction time (wave I to V) (r = 0.35, p less than 0.01). We conclude that hyperbilirubinemia affects adjoining areas of the brain stem that control hearing and cry production.\r"

Severity of the illness was assessed by a clinical croup score based on retractions, stridor, air entry, cyanosis, and level of consciousness. Twelve hours from the time of injection, the patients receiving the dexamethasone had a statistically significant decline in median croup score from 4.5 to 1.0 (p less than 0.001), whereas the patients receiving the placebo did not. By 24 hours, a decline of two or more points in the total croup score was noted in 85% of the patients in the dexamethasone group compared with 33% of the patients in the placebo group (p = 0.027). During this same period, only 19% of patients receiving dexamethasone required two or more racemic epinephrine treatments in comparison with 62% of patients who received the placebo (p less than 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the two groups in improvement in oxygen saturation, respiratory rates, or duration of hospitalization. We conclude that dexamethasone is beneficial in reducing the overall severity of moderate to severe acute laryngotracheitis during the first 24 hours after injection.\r"

Some isolates are internally relatively homogeneous while others are heterogeneous. There was no correlation between virus complexity and disease stage. One isolate was in fact a mixture of two distinct strains. A strong preference for G----A base substitutions was observed.

At the ultrastructural level, round and oval clear spaces, divided by septae into several smaller ones, appeared in the neuropil. The pathogenesis of the majority of the vacuoles and cavitations is not clear yet but a focal loss of cortical neurons was evident and furthermore some of the vacuoles were identified as remnants of dendrites. The light and electron microscopic findings can not be interpreted as artefacts or as a simple edema of the brain and also can not be explained by the different infective complications. We have found spongiform alterations in all cases of clinically diagnosed dementia and therefore it seems obvious that these findings are quite frequent in AIDS dementia.\r"

The study comprised 2,301 adults, all apparently healthy. Crude prevalence rates range from 0.5 to 11.8%. We found three clearly different areas of HTLV-I seroprevalence rates. An area of low seropositivity in southern Chad and northern Cameroon (0.5-2.0%), an area of moderate seropositivity in the savannah region of Ngaoundere, Cameroon (4.2%) and in Bata, Equatorial Guinea (6.5%), and lastly an area of high seropositivity (8.6-11.8%) in the equatorial forest area of Equatorial Guinea and southern Cameroon. HTLV-I seroprevalence rates increased with age up to 12.6% after 40 years old in the areas of high seropositivity. There was no difference between male and female age-adjusted prevalence rates in all of the areas studied.\r"

  ".W": "It is clear that the traditional treatment program, as illustrated by the pyramid, does not suppress inflammation in most patients with RA to an extent sufficient to prevent joint damage. There is no basis for the concept that slow acting drugs are uniquely disease modifying. Disease modification correlates best with control of inflammation. Contrary to popular wisdom, this has been best demonstrated with prednisone. The arbitrary concept of a drug being either antiinflammatory or disease modifying serves no useful purpose and should be dropped. Many medications provide incomplete or temporary suppression of inflammation, presumably by differing mechanisms of action. Based on this rationale, a therapeutic program is proposed, employing a combination of drugs to control inflammation in the critical early stages of RA. With this step-down bridge concept, medications are sequentially withdrawn in contrast to the traditional pyramid, in which they have been sequentially added. Our early experience with patients indicates that toxicity is no greater problem with combined drugs than with the same drugs used individually. Time and comparative observations will be needed to show the optimum combination of drugs and whether the step-down bridge concept will achieve the sought-for and presently unobtained goal of early and sustained control of inflammation, improved quality of life, and prevention of bone and joint damage.\r"

Because our patients had recurrent thrombotic episodes, higher previous and subsequent titers of APLA, and other manifestations that have been similarly proposed to associate with APLA, our observations may indicate consumption of the APLA in the course of the thromboocclusive episode.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hand has been suggested to be the result of \"wear\" and \"tear.\" If so, OA should develop more frequently in the dominant hand. We compared dominant with nondominant hands of 134 consecutive community subjects aged 53-75 by questionnaire, radiographs of hands, and rheumatologic evaluation. Mean age was 60 years, 93% were right handed, and 95% were in occupations classified as nonphysical. Subjects estimated dominant hand use of 2-10 times the amount of the nondominant hand. OA was found in 133 of 134 subjects. No radiologic or clinical differences were found between the dominant and nondominant hands. Twenty-six subjects who self-reported heavier lifetime hand use had somewhat greater clinical and hand radiographic OA scores than the 36 subjects reporting lighter hand use (43.5 vs 34.5) (p less than 0.01). In our study population, OA was not more prevalent in the dominant hand.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the in vitro effects of therapeutic doses of tiaprofenic acid (26 micrograms/ml; 2.6 micrograms/ml), sodium salicylate (160 micrograms/ml), and hydrocortisone (7.25 micrograms/ml; 0.725 micrograms/ml) on the proteoglycan metabolism (catabolism and synthesis) and chondrocyte ultrastructure of organ explant cultures of human osteoarthritic (OA) articular cartilage. The effect of these drugs on chondrocyte neutral metalloprotease synthesis was also examined. Tiaprofenic acid and the higher concentration of hydrocortisone had a similar suppressive effect on proteoglycan catabolism (38%). The effect of the lower concentration of hydrocortisone was less marked (29%), while sodium salicylate had the least effect (21%). The proteoglycan released in each treated group was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than that of the untreated one. The suppression of proteoglycan catabolism by tiaprofenic acid was reversible in all but one specimen. This reversal was only seen in 4 of the 8 patient specimens treated with sodium salicylate and in 2 of the 8 patient specimens treated with the higher dose of hydrocortisone. The decrease in proteoglycan catabolism induced by these drugs correlated with their potential to reduce synthesis of neutral metalloprotease. The proteoglycan synthesis in cartilage organ explant cultures was reduced by sodium salicylate and hydrocortisone, but not by tiaprofenic acid. These findings were corroborated through an electron microscopic study, showing extensive vesicular dilatation of chondrocytic endoplasmic reticulum seen only in explants treated with hydrocortisone or sodium salicylate. Our data suggests that some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) are able to decrease OA cartilage catabolism. However, caution should be taken since certain NSAID, like salicylate, may also possibly jeopardize the cartilage repair process by inhibiting the proteoglycan synthesis.\r"

Trabecular bone volume and width were evaluated by histomorphometry and radiographic grading of osteoarthritis (OA) of hand joints was also done. Patients were divided into 2 groups: no or low grade OA (Group 1) and manifest OA Grades II-IV (Group 2). From the 27 specimens tested (women 56-80 years old), 17 were in Group 1 and 10 in Group 2. Significant differences in stiffness (E), compressive strength, trabecular bone volume and trabecular width between the 2 groups were found. In the group with manifest OA, bone was significantly stiffer, had a significantly increased compressive strength value, a significantly higher trabecular bone volume and trabecular width, compared to the group with no or low OA grade. Significant correlations were found between elastic modulus and trabecular bone volume and width, and also between compressive strength and trabecular bone volume and width. Our findings support the hypothesis that the primary defect in OA is not in the articular cartilage but in the subchondral bone and that primary OA is part of a more general bone disease.\r"

A dietary history interview was conducted within the 4 months following resection of the primary tumor. In the stepwise multivariate analysis, the multiple-odds ratio (OR) for having a tumor greater than or equal to 20 mm in diameter was 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.99) for each 1-g increase in fiber intake per 10 MJ of energy intake. Compared with patients having tumors poor in estrogen receptor (ER), those having ER-rich tumors (greater than or equal to 0.10 fmol/microgram of DNA) were older (P less than .01) and reported carbohydrate intake yielding higher E% (percentage of total energy intake) (P less than .01) and higher retinol intake per 10 MJ (P less than .05). The OR for having an ER-rich tumor was 1.58 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.31) for each 1-mg increase in retinol intake per 10 MJ; 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.16) for each additional year of age; and 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.13) for each 1% increment in E% from carbohydrates. These results suggest that the dietary patterns of the western world (e.g., high fat intake and low intake of carbohydrates and fiber) affect certain prognostic factors in breast cancer, such as tumor size and ER content of the tumor.\r"

These probes were used to study DNA extracted from tumors and normal tissues and/or tumor cell lines from five patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancer. Tumor DNA from four of the five patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancer retained heterozygosity at loci on 3p. Cytogenetic studies of the tumor cell lines established from these four patients showed retention of both short arms of chromosome 3. We conclude that the loss of genetic material from 3p observed in small cell lung cancer is not typical in extrapulmonary small cell cancer.\r"

A subpopulation of cells was generated that was at least twice as large as aerobic cells and contained greater than normal G2-M DNA content. This subpopulation showed no resistance to a continuous exposure to either ADR or methotrexate, nor was it more resistant to a pulse of ADR than the remaining cells with normal DNA content. Our data indicate that hypoxia can produce significant ADR resistance. However, conditions resulting in overproduced DNA did not cause significant additional resistance.\r"

The least methotrexate-resistant subline was completely sensitive to drugs associated with the multidrug resistance phenotype. However, more highly methotrexate-resistant sublines were significantly cross-resistant to vincristine, vinblastine, and dactinomycin (maximum relative resistance, 40-fold). These sublines were not cross-resistant to doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and teniposide. Regression analysis indicated that relative resistance to methotrexate was correlated with relative resistance to vincristine (r = 0.96) and vinblastine (r = 0.99). Such cross-resistance in highly methotrexate-resistant cells may have important clinical implications.\r"
