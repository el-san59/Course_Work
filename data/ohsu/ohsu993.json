  ".W": "Allergic Aspergillus sinusitis is a well-defined clinical and histologic entity, although surprisingly few reported cases have yielded any fungal growth on culture. Taking advantage of recent changes in the identification and classification of certain groups of fungi, we were able to identify a specific fungal organism in 19 of 22 consecutive patients with a histologic diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis over the past 2 1/2 years. Aspergillus was found in only one patient, while an organism in the family of dematiaceous fungi was found in 18 patients. Of these patients, the genus Bipolaris was the most commonly represented, while Exserohilum, Curvularia, and Alternaria species were seen with less frequency. Thus, it appears that Aspergillus may not be the most common etiologic agent in allergic \"Aspergillus\" sinusitis. Allergic fungal sinusitis is not unusual and its incidence may be increasing. On initial clinical evaluation it may be easily mistaken for malignancy or invasive fungal disease with the potential for overly aggressive treatment. Preoperative suspicion of allergic fungal sinusitis based on clinical and roentgenographic findings along with careful communication with the mycology laboratory about the possibility of dematiaceous fungal growth are necessary for proper diagnosis.\r"

Fungal cultures were performed for 55 bullae. The principal organisms isolated were alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae non-type B. Only 12 anaerobic organisms and four fungi were isolated. Of the 204 bullae cultured, multiple organisms were found in 61 bullae and 40 showed no growth. Isolates of other less common organisms were also found. These data are analyzed on the basis of age and duration of symptoms, and antibiotic treatment is described.\r"

A combination of DNA histogram features were used to define abnormal DNA-containing cell populations that were interpreted as representing intraepithelial neoplastic transformation. Eighteen biopsy specimens were classified as dysplasia/keratosis and graded SIN I, six (33%) of which were aneuploid. Eighteen (78%) of 23 biopsy specimens graded SIN II were aneuploid, and all 15 biopsy specimens graded SIN III had abnormal quantities of nuclear DNA. Twelve biopsy specimens (six of SIN II grade and six of SIN III grade) were considered to represent keratinizing forms of dysplasia, and all 12 (100%) were found to contain increased (aneuploid) quantities of DNA. We conclude that the proposed SIN-grading scheme for laryngeal epithelial abnormalities exhibits strong correlations with nuclear DNA content. In addition, aneuploidy was observed in all SIN II- and SIN III-graded biopsy specimens with prominent keratinization.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis of 457 radical neck dissections performed over a 30-year period for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx was carried out. Two hundred thirteen patients underwent radiotherapy to the primary cancer site and/or to the neck. Of these, 164 underwent perioperative adjuvant radiotherapy and 24 underwent definitive radiation for cure and were followed up by salvage surgery. Thus, 188 patients received radiotherapy for nonrecurrent disease. Twenty-five additional patients underwent radiation for surgical failure following radical neck dissection. The goal of the study was to determine whether radiotherapy altered the course or end result of the disease. The T and N stage at onset of disease was similar for the radiotherapy and nonradiotherapy groups. Preoperative radiotherapy was effective in down staging the disease at the primary site and, to a lesser extent, in the lymph nodes, but had limited impact on survival. Failure to control the disease in the neck occurred in 60 (32%) of the 188 patients who received radiotherapy for primary disease; recurrence rates were lower in the combined therapy group than in the surgical group of patients with N2 and N3 stages of disease. The 3-year disease-free survival was 45%; this was no better than the 63% survival rate in patients who did not receive radiotherapy, although survival was better in the combined therapy group for patients with N3 stage of disease. The worst results were in those patients who were irradiated for surgical failure (14% survival); the 24 patients who required salvage radical neck dissection following failure of definitive radiotherapy for cure had a 42% survival.\r"

As a result of the prior utilization of a \"dual\" management protocol, there were 170 children who received endotracheal intubation, and 64 children managed without placement of an artificial airway. In all, five children (2.1%) of varying ages developed this complication--all experienced severe airway obstruction progressing to respiratory arrest, with evidence of pulmonary edema developing shortly after endotracheal intubation. Two of these five children died due to complications resulting from upper airway obstruction-induced cardiorespiratory arrest. By contrast, no child with milder degrees of airway obstruction managed without an artificial airway exhibited clinical evidence of pulmonary edema. Several possible mechanisms for the development of this complication are described. Pulmonary edema associated with epiglottitis is an uncommon complication that can occur following endotracheal intubation in those patients with marked respiratory insufficiency. An artificial airway should be instituted in all cases of pediatric epiglottitis--the potential complication of pulmonary edema should be anticipated before placement of an artificial airway, especially in those patients with a severe degree of upper airway obstruction.\r"

A 2.5 MHz transducer connected to a diagnostic ultrasound machine was placed in a water tank facing pulsatile jets (duration, 0.5 second) obtained by a calibrated injector. Flow rate from 6 to 52 ml/sec were tested through a 5 mm diameter circular orifice. Four different three-dimensional inflow tract geometries were compared: (A) sharp-edged, (B) Venturi (funnel), (C) converging conical, and (D) diverging conical. Mean velocities of jets were measured by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography. Driving pressures were also measured by means of a fluid-filled catheter. Two observers independently digitized contours of maximal color jet areas by computer system from two separate sets of experiments. Results are given as the mean values of the four measurements for each parameter. Jet areas were correlated to flow rate, with no difference from A through D. The shape (eccentricity) of jets was different between A and B (p less than 0.05), between B and D (p less than 0.01), and between C and D (p less than 0.01). The shape of jets was correlated with flow rate, continuous-wave velocity, and pressure gradient in B, C, and D but not in A. Measured pressure gradients and estimated gradients by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography were similarly correlated from A through D.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The methods were applied to an in vitro pulsatile flow model. With the intraluminal method, pulsed Doppler recordings obtained throughout several flow pulses at different positions across a tube were digitized, and cross-sectional flow velocity profiles were obtained by matching the onset of flow velocity at the various positions. With the extraluminal method, cross-sectional flow velocity profiles were obtained by time interpolation between the digital flow velocity data obtained from several flow velocity maps. The first flow velocity map was recorded at onset of flow and the following maps were incrementally delayed with 20 msec from one flow pulse to the next. The time lag caused by the time needed to update each of the flow velocity maps was compensated for by time interpolation between the sequentially recorded flow velocity maps. The cross-sectional flow velocity profiles obtained with the two methods were compared at identical positions within the tube model at equal flow settings and throughout the pulsatile flow periods. At three different flow settings with peak flow velocity of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 m/sec, the difference (mean +/- SD) between the obtained velocities were 0.01 +/- 0.04, -0.01 +/- 0.05, and -0.03 +/- 0.07 m/sec, respectively. The findings suggest that cross-sectional flow velocity profiles from pulsatile flow velocity recordings can be obtained equally well with both methods.\r"

Inasmuch as reversible ischemia causes no structural damage and irreversible ischemia results in persistent structural myocardial damage, we postulated that ultrasonic tissue characterization can distinguish the two types of injuries. Anesthetized open chest dogs underwent 15 minutes (group 1, n = 5) and 90 minutes (group 2, n = 8) of acute total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. Myocardial ischemia-infarction was confirmed with segment shortening, electronmicroscopic examination, and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Integrated backscatter Rayleigh 5 (IBR5), a measure of ultrasonic backscatter, and Fourier coefficient of amplitude modulation (FAM), an index of cardiac cycle dependent variation in backscatter, were measured at baseline, during ischemia, and after reperfusion. Group 1 (reversible ischemia) showed an increase in IBR5 from -48 +/- 1.2 dB at control to -45 +/- 1.0 dB (p less than 0.01) during ischemia, which returned to baseline after reperfusion (-47 +/- 1.3 dB).

  ".W": "We recorded two-dimensional echocardiograms simultaneously with the respiration measurements of 20 normal subjects and 20 patients with anterior myocardial infarction. The apical long-axis and four-chamber views were quantitatively analyzed. Measurement variability of global ejection fraction and regional ejection fraction of 100 regions was calculated during inspiration and at end-expiration for two observers. To minimize variability, the endocardial contour was redefined and traced with an improved computer-assisted tracing system. Variability (absolute mean difference) between two beats at end-expiration was significantly less than during inspiration (p less than 0.05): for ejection fraction the variability at end-expiration was 3.4% and the variability during inspiration was 6.4% (mean, 54%; SD, 7%); for regional ejection fraction the variability at end-expiration was 11.8% and the variability during inspiration was 21.5% (mean, 56%; SD, 15%). Intraobserver and interobserver variability values of one beat at end-expiration for ejection fraction were 3.1% and 3.8%, respectively, and 9.5% and 12.8%, respectively, for regional ejection fraction. Variability in patients with myocardial infarction was comparable. This method of recording respiration and analyzing left ventricular function at end-expiration, with a new contour definition and tracing system, provides a measurement variability that is considerably less than that reported in previous echocardiographic studies and that is comparable to angiographic methods.\r"

  ".W": "Sedation is often required for extended or quantitative echocardiographic examination of young patients. To test the hypothesis that patient viewing of entertaining videotapes during echocardiographic examinations would reduce the need for sedation and that Doppler pressure gradients so obtained would correspond satisfactorily with subsequent catheterization pressure gradients, 38 patients (age, 5 to 64 months; mean age, 18.6 months) with a variety of cardiac defects were studied. Because of excessive activity, resistance, fear, or crying, all of these patients would have normally been sedated. Instead, an age-appropriate videotape was used for patient viewing. In 35 of 38 patients, complete examinations were obtained with video viewing with no sedation. Twelve study patients later underwent catheterization while receiving sedation. The Doppler pressure gradients obtained while patients were viewing videotapes corresponded well with catheterization (r = 0.94). However, those pressure gradients were higher than those obtained with catheterization (mean, 8.3 mm Hg), but there was only one significant discrepancy of 22 mm Hg. In this series, complete examinations were obtained without sedation in 92% of subjects who would have normally required sedation (p less than 0.001), with minimal reduction in the accuracy of prediction of subsequent sedated catheterization pressure gradients. This suggests that near baseline conditions existed while patients were viewing television. Video viewing during echocardiographic examinations appears to be advantageous.\r"

  ".W": "To define the normal size of the foramen ovale and the transatrial Doppler velocity pattern in the fetus, we examined foramen ovale size, foramen flap angle, and motion in 48 consecutive normal human fetal ultrasound studies. The maximal foramen diameter was similar in size to aortic root diameter at all gestational ages, differing by no more than 1.0 mm in any study. Attachment angle at the junction of the foramen with the rim of the foramen varied from 30 degrees to 50 degrees; at least a 30-degree angle was present at some point in the cardiac cycle in all studies. A redundant flap, defined as flap reaching greater than one half of the way across to the left atrial free wall, was observed in only three (6%) fetuses. Seventeen patients had transatrial Doppler velocities recorded with sample volume placed in the trough of the foramen flap on the left atrial side of the foramen ovale. A triphasic pattern was evident in systole with predominantly right-to-left flow in all fetuses. A biphasic pattern was present in diastole with bidirectional flow in all fetuses; this is toward the left atrium in early diastole and toward the right atrium in late diastole. Maximal right-to-left velocity ranged from 15 to 40 cm/sec (mean, 23 cm/sec) and was always less than or equal to mitral A wave velocity. Maximal left-to-right velocity ranged from 5 to 20 cm/sec (mean, 13 cm/sec). These data indicate that normal foramen ovale size is similar to aortic diameter, and foramen flap angle should reach 30 degrees or greater.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subsequent transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated three defects within the atrial septal aneurysm with left-to-right shunting across each defect. Normal pulmonary venous connections were also defined. All echocardiographic findings were confirmed at surgery. This case demonstrates the additional diagnostic accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography for detecting disease of the atrial septum.\r"

Six year mortality was 36%, 24%, 0%, and 16% respectively. In patients with acute myocardial infarction a higher mortality rate during follow up was associated with a higher than average age, a higher than average creatine kinase, previous myocardial infarction, Q wave infarction, and the presence of reciprocal changes. The presence of reciprocal changes was associated with higher than average concentration of serum creatine kinase, indicating more extensive infarction. Infarction complicated by ventricular fibrillation or left bundle branch block was associated with a higher death rate. The electrocardiogram recorded at the time of acute myocardial infarction contains much useful prognostic information.\r"

Technetium-99m gated blood pool images were obtained at rest and during exercise before, six weeks after, and a mean of fifteen months after successful angioplasty.

Left ventriculograms were obtained from 11 healthy individuals and 49 patients with coronary heart disease (30 with a previous myocardial infarction and 19 without any signs of myocardial damage). Post-extrasystolic potentiation was induced by a regularly driven right atrial rhythm that was interrupted by one atrial extrasystole in such a way that the post-extrasystolic RR interval was kept equal to the basic RR interval. The left ventricular end diastolic volumes of the pre-extrasystolic and post-extrasystolic beats were equal. In all groups there was evidence of post-extrasystolic potentiation in one or more of the indices of left ventricular function (ejection fraction, mean normalised systolic ejection rate, and systolic volume, and stroke volume). Potentiation was especially evident in patients with left ventricular damage; this suggests that a compensating mechanism is an intrinsic property of the myocardium. The Frank-Starling mechanism does not contribute to the increased performance of the post-extrasystolic beat in normal individuals or in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

In 15 (7.3%) patients impaired arterial perfusion due to vascular spasm with or without thrombus formation was seen in the cannulated leg after catheterisation. Despite heparinisation, signs of impaired arterial circulation persisted in nine patients (4.4% of the total). In these patients femoral artery thrombosis was strongly suspected. Six (53%) of these had undergone a balloon dilatation. Therefore in this study the risk of femoral artery thrombosis developing was 12 times greater after transarterial balloon dilatation than after arterial catheterisation without dilatation (20.6% v 1.7%). Systemic infusion of streptokinase was started in all patients with femoral artery thrombosis. Arterial perfusion became normal in all patients, though in one this was delayed. Haematological monitoring showed lengthening of the thrombin time and a decrease of the fibrinogen concentration during streptokinase treatment. There were no serious complications. Systemic infusion of streptokinase is a safe and useful treatment in children with persistent femoral artery thrombosis after arterial cardiac catheterisation.\r"

In the four patients with normal pulmonary artery pressures colour Doppler flow mapping showed multicoloured wide and long systolic and diastolic jets in the pulmonary artery. In the 15 patients with raised pulmonary arterial pressure the systolic jets varied from multicoloured to red and were thinner: in patients with considerably raised pulmonary arterial pressure the jets became redder during diastole. The Doppler velocity tracings showed that in patients with normal pulmonary artery pressures the mean peak systolic velocity was higher than the mean end diastolic velocity--so that in all four the ratio of peak systolic velocity to end diastolic velocity was less than 2. The mean peak systolic velocity was much higher than the mean end diastolic velocity in 13 of the 15 patients with raised pulmonary artery pressure; this meant that the ratio of peak systolic velocity to end diastolic velocity was greater than 2 in 10 of 11 patients. The end diastolic velocity was significantly lower in those patients with raised pulmonary artery pressure than in those with normal artery pressure. There was an inverse linear correlation between the mean pulmonary artery pressure and end diastolic ductal jet velocity in 17 of the 19 patients. Colour flow mapping and this quantitative Doppler technique can detect pulmonary artery hypertension in patients with a ductus arteriosus.\r"

In eight patients (mean age 7.7 years, range 3 months to 29 years) with transposition of the great arteries mass spectrometry was used to measure oxygen uptake and predict pulmonary end capillary blood oxygen content. The effects of the bronchial circulation were studied by computer modelling. There was close agreement between pulmonary end capillary and pulmonary vein blood oxygen contents but the resultant percentage difference in arteriovenous content difference was significant (mean (SE of difference)) (14.5(3.8)%). The effect of the bronchial circulation was to give spuriously high estimates of pulmonary blood flow. The error was greatest when oxygen consumption was low and aortic blood was very desaturated.\r"

The phonocardiogram confirmed a high frequency sound occurring 60-90 ms after aortic valve closure and coinciding with the time of maximal excursion of the atrioventricular valve patch towards the ventricular mass. One patient had coexisting congenital complete heart block. The M mode echocardiogram showed \"reversed\" motion of the patch towards the right atrium during atrial contraction. Doppler flow studies showed that coincident with this motion there was forward flow in the pulmonary artery with augmentation when atrial contraction coincided with ventricular systole. The early diastolic click in these patients was explained by abrupt cessation of the motion of the atrioventricular valve patch towards the ventricular mass in early diastole. In one patient atrial contraction led to a reversal of this motion and was associated with forward flow in the pulmonary artery.\r"

The other seven women added the two dydrogesterone doses in reverse sequence. No dydrogesterone was taken during months 8 and 9. Lipids and lipoproteins were measured before treatment and at the end of months 4, 7 and 9. Lipids were also estimated in an untreated (reference) group of eight postmenopausal women on two occasions 6 months apart; these showed significant changes in HDL2- and HDL3-cholesterol. In the treatment group, HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein (apo) A1 were significantly higher and LDL-cholesterol and apo B were significantly lower at months 4, 7 and 9 compared with baseline values. Triglyceride levels were increased significantly over baseline values, but remained within the normal range. No significant differences between the two dydrogesterone doses were observed on any lipid and lipoprotein fraction, nor were there any differences between the oestrogen-only and oestrogen/dydrogesterone treatment phases. Dydrogesterone appears to cause little, if any, lipid and lipoprotein changes and assessment in a larger population of postmenopausal women is warranted.\r"

The effects of the two dydrogesterone doses on endometrial histology, vaginal bleeding, and the symptomatic and psychological status were compared. Endometrial samples were obtained around day 10 of progestogen addition. Dydrogesterone, 20 mg, induced uniform, late secretory transformation in all samples; with 10 mg one sample showed mixed early and late secretory features and another demonstrated late secretory changes associated with atypical hyperplasia. Both dydrogesterone doses induced an acceptable withdrawal bleed; most bleeding episodes were 'spotting' or normal in amount, and heavy bleeding was reported infrequently. There was one episode of breakthrough bleeding. There were no differences in bleeding patterns between the two dose regimens. Anxiety, and the physical and psychological status were significantly improved after 3 months of therapy. Significant benefits on depression were observed less clearly. There were no differences between the two dydrogesterone doses on anxiety, depression and the physical and psychological status, and, overall, the addition of the progestogen did not antagonize oestrogen benefits.\r"

In 248 of the 537 pregnancies (46%) in this group there were no maternal complications or fetal malformations and the perinatal mortality (PNM) rate was 2.4%. The PNM rate increased significantly to 13.1% when there was associated pre-eclampsia, 10% with gestational diabetes, and to 7.6% with miscellaneous complications. When polyhydramnios was associated with a fetal or placental malformation the PNM rate was 61.4%. The commonest malformations were central nervous system (31%), musculoskeletal (12%) and gastrointestinal system anomalies (10%). Placental chorioangioma occurred in two patients (0.4%) and both babies died. In women with low oestriol excretion (18% of the 455 tested) the PNM rate increased five times to 22.7%.\r"

In association with state 1F the average recording time to obtain a satisfactory NST and BPS was 27.0 and 26.3 min respectively, and 52.6% and 44.0% respectively failed to achieve a 'normal' result. In contrast, satisfactory results were always obtained in the two active states (2F and 4F), and the average time was 3-5 min. Mature fetuses spend on average one third of the time in state 1F, and knowledge of its characteristics is therefore important, for the interpretation of biophysical tests. Our results suggest that continuation of biophysical recording for at least 40 min is necessary before an unreactive NST or low BPS should be regarded as suspicious. We suggest that interpretation of the NST and BPS should be made in the light of knowledge of normal patterns of behavioural development rather than using an arbitrarily defined scoring system.\r"

In 12 of the eyes the examinations were repeated within one year in order to follow changes in retinal light sensitivity during the evolution of the lesions. Retinal cotton-wool spots were in all eyes associated with localised non-arcuate scotomata in the visual field. In four eyes the cotton-wool spots disappeared within three months of the first examination, and in two of these cases the corresponding scotomata disappeared together with the morphological lesions. In eight eyes the cotton-wool spots (and the corresponding scotomata) had not resolved one year after the first examination.

Of the retinal breaks recognised dialysis at the ora serrata was observed in 49 eyes, of which 28 were situated at the lower temporal quadrant. Seventeen eyes had irregular breaks arising within necrotic retina at the site of scleral impact. Twenty-four (31.2%) patients had retinal break or retinal detachment diagnosed within 24 hours of injury and 49 (63.6%) within six weeks. Immediate retinal detachment was a feature of necrotic retinal breaks, while inferior oral dialyses led to a slow accumulation of subretinal fluid. Delayed diagnosis of retinal detachment was due either to opaque media or to failure to examine the retina after injury. Visual prognosis was good when retinal break or detachment were diagnosed within six weeks of injury. However, those patients who escaped initial retinal examination and were lost to follow-up had a less favourable visual outcome.\r"

In four patients there was an increase of intraretinal haemorrhages and hard exudates, accompanied by clinically significant macular oedema manifested as retinal thickening and extensive fluorescein leakage from both the macular and the peripapillary capillary networks. Of these four patients one also developed retinal ischaemia, evident ophthalmoscopically by flame-shaped haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots and angiographically by areas of capillary non-perfusion. The fifth patient showed proliferation of new blood vessels and vitreous haemorrhage. Diabetic patients scheduled for cataract surgery should undergo a thorough preoperative evaluation of any existing retinopathy. Postoperatively they should be followed up at close intervals so that any progression of retinopathy can be promptly detected and considered for laser treatment.\r"

Normal corneal epithelial cells, keratocytes, and endothelial cells expressed at least two distinct N-linked oligosaccharide subsets, of the non-bisected, biantennary and bisected, bi-/triantennary types. Corneal scars stained variably with the lectin subsets described above, and with Maclura pomifera agglutinin. Lattice dystrophy corneas showed a loss of the oligosaccharide expression observed on the plasma membranes of normal epithelial cells, and there was concurrent deposition of extracellular glycoprotein within the corneal stroma, which was of the same oligosaccharide subsets as were lost from the epithelial cell plasma membranes. This extracellular stromal glycoprotein was far more widely deposited than the amyloid and extended well beyond the stromal scarring. We propose that these observations are related and that in lattice corneal dystrophy a glycoprotein(s) is shed from the plasma membranes of epithelial cells and sequestrated within the corneal stroma, where it subsequently stimulates amyloid deposition.\r"

This study involves measurement of the pupil cycle time (PCT) to evaluate the autonomic nerve system of the iris to determine the presence of subclinical intraocular involvement. The study included 19 lepromatous (LL), 19 borderline lepromatous (BL), and five borderline tuberculoid (BT) leprosy patients and involved 25 healthy volunteers, 10 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and eight with Duhring disease. The PCT was measured in these groups. In all leprosy groups included in the study the PCT was higher than in the control groups. Moreover, the PCT of the leprosy patients without any intraocular involvement was higher than in the controls. These results show that in the ophthalmic examination of leprosy patients without any symptoms the fact that autonomic nerve system of the eye is affected by the leprosy can often be determined by measuring the PCT.\r"

It is of special interest for genetic consultation to evaluate an examination method for detecting subclinically involved patients. Seven patients of two families were examined. Three of them had the typical symptoms of DIOA: reduced visual acuity, tritan defect, temporal pallor of both optic discs, and a relative central scotoma for white test spots. In visual evoked cortical potentials (VECP) the amplitudes were reduced, and in one patient the latencies were slightly delayed and two patients considerably so. The amplitude of the negative component of the PERG was markedly reduced, while the positive component was normal. In the remaining four family members normal retinal and cortical responses were recorded under standard conditions and visual fields and colour vision (FM 100 hue) were also normal. However, static perimetry with blue test spots showed in two family members enlarged central scotomas, thus proving that they had subclinical DIOA.\r"

The main feature of interest was a massive accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium at the posterior pole, and quantitative fluorescence microscopy provided values three times those obtained in appropriate control tissue. The photoreceptor layer was normal at the posterior pole but became progressively atrophic towards the periphery. The concentration of lipopofuscin was proportional to the degree of preservation of the retinal photoreceptors. By electron microscopy the cells in the RPE were seen to be packed with a mixture of lipofuscin granules and melanolysosomal complexes, but occasional photoreceptor phagosomes were found. Bruch's membrane and the choriocapillaris were normal. We attribute this hitherto unreported abnormality of the RPE after trauma to a dysfunction consequent on an overload of the monolayer by photoreceptor debris at the time of trauma.\r"

Of the diabetic patients' 76% eyes improved by at least two lines of Snellen acuity postoperatively. Of these patients 68% eyes and of the control eyes 83% achieved an acuity of 6/12 or better. In the diabetics the visual outcome depended on the state of the retinopathy and in particular the maculopathy. The diabetic group had a greater incidence of postoperative inflammation, but the major complications were related to continuing neovascularisation. Early postoperative laser photocoagulation may help to prevent these proliferative complications, and, provided a large, adequate capsulotomy is performed for capsular thickening, the presence of an IOL does not interfere with this photocoagulation. We also advise early postoperative assessment, and treatment if necessary, of any maculopathy. Diabetic retinopathy should no longer be regarded as a contraindication to intraocular lens insertion.\r"

This translocation was associated with female sex (63%), age less than 1 year (60%), hyperleukocytosis (median leukocyte count, 156.5 x 10(9)/L), CD10-/CD19+ B-precursor cell immunophenotype, and myeloid-associated antigen (CD15) expression (63%). Nearly all cases had at least some CD24- blast cells. The CD10-/CD15%/CD19+/CD24/+ phenotype was found in 20 of the 32 t(4;11) cases tested. None of the 40 cases had the cytogenetic finding of hyperdiploidy greater than 50, which is a favorable prognostic feature. For clinical comparison, the t(4;11) cases were divided into three groups according to age at diagnosis: less than 1 year (n = 24), 1 to 9 years (n = 8), and greater than or equal to 10 years (n = 8). Compared with older patients, infants were more likely to have initial central nervous system leukemia (P = .05) and less likely to have pre-B-cell ALL (P = .05). Complete continuous remission has been maintained in only 7 of 24 infants and 2 of 8 patients aged greater than or equal to 10 years, in contrast to 7 of 8 children in the intermediate age group (P = .048). These findings suggest that the t(4;11) is an adverse prognostic feature in these two age groups.\r"

  ".W": "To define conditions for improved efficiency of retroviral-mediated gene transfer and expression in primate progenitor cells, four rhesus monkeys were treated with a 200 mg/kg intravenous bolus of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The kinetics of hematopoietic suppression and recovery were assessed in peripheral blood, bone marrow mononuclear cells, and bone marrow cells fractionated in an albumin density gradient. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were transduced with N2, a retroviral vector carrying the bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase gene (NPT), which confers resistance to the otherwise toxic neomycin analogue, G418. Circulating colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) disappeared at 2 days. CFU-GM, transducible CFU-GM, CD34+ cells, and the percent of cells in cycle decreased at 3 days in unfractionated bone marrow cells and in a light density population known to be enriched for these progenitors and for stem cells. NPT activity in the light-density fraction, marginally detectable before treatment, disappeared at 3 days as well. At day 7 the CFU-GM plating efficiency, the CD34+ cell content, and the percentage of cells in cell cycle began to increase in the light-density fraction. The NPT assay became faintly positive again but the CFU-GM were not yet transducible, implying that it was an earlier progenitor population that was dividing and differentiating. By day 15, there was a marked rebound in all of the progenitors measured, and transduction efficiency assessed by G418R CFU-GM and NPT assay rebounded to several times pretreatment levels. The data suggest that CFU-GM are optimally transduced at 15 days but that earlier progenitors are more likely cycling and transducible before 5 days, a time when a gene transfer experiment would probably have the best chance to succeed.\r"

The present study was prompted by our previous work in which we showed that the b/b rat has hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia associated with increased megakaryocyte size. To define the basic mechanism underlying this abnormality in the b/b rat we have studied both megakaryocytopoiesis and granulopoiesis in anemic b/b rats, chronically transfused b/b rats, iron-treated b/b rats, and controls. We have found decreased concentrations of megakaryocyte and granulocyte progenitors in the marrow of b/b rats. Full correction of the severe anemia by chronic transfusion resulted in normalization of megakaryocyte progenitors, small acetylcholinesterase positive cells, megakaryocyte size, and platelet counts, along with granulocyte progenitors. In contrast, the partial correction of anemia obtained by iron treatment resulted in improvement, but not normalization, of these parameters. These findings indicate that abnormal megakaryocytopoiesis in the b/b rat can be best interpreted as a consequence of hypoxia because of the severe anemia. Because we have recently shown that the number of erythroid progenitors in b/b rats is also low, we propose that abnormal megakaryocytopoiesis in this animal is a reflection of an acquired stem cell disorder induced by the prolonged hypoxia resulting from the severe anemia.\r"

  ".U": "91120946\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in the megakaryocytic differentiation. Recently, we have observed that IL-6 is synthesized by several human cell lines with megakaryocytic features. In this study, we have investigated whether a similar phenomenon occurs during normal megakaryocytic differentiation. Human megakaryocytes (MK) were obtained by culturing normal marrow in liquid culture with aplastic plasma (AP). First, an IL-6 secretion in bone marrow culture enriched in MK as well as in purified MK populations was demonstrated by a biologic assay. Second, IL-6 mRNA was detected in a purified population of MK by the polymerase chain reaction and dot blot analysis. IL-6 mRNA and protein were undetectable in platelets. Third, in situ hybridization procedure demonstrated the presence of IL-6 mRNA in individual immature MK. Fourth, IL-6 protein was detected in MK at the unicellular level by an immunoalkaline phosphatase technique using a monoclonal antibody against IL-6. Furthermore, the presence of IL-6 receptor (IL-6-R) on MK was demonstrated by in situ hybridization using an IL-6-R probe and in situ autoradiography after binding with [125I]-labeled recombinant IL-6. The IL-6 endogenously produced in liquid cultures containing normal human plasma or AP was subsequently neutralized. This resulted in a 50% decrease of the MK growth with a minor shift in the ploidy distribution toward lower values. In semisolid cultures the addition of anti-IL-6 antibodies led to a 42% decrease in colony number in cultures stimulated by IL-3 but not in other conditions of culture. These results suggest that normal human megakaryocytopoiesis might be regulated in part by an IL-6 autocrine loop.\r"

  ".W": "Hematopoietic depression and subsequent susceptibility to potentially lethal opportunistic infections are well-documented phenomena following radiotherapy. Methods to therapeutically mitigate radiation-induced myelosuppression could offer great clinical value. In vivo studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulates pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell (CFU-s), granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cell (GM-CFC), and erythroid progenitor cell (CFU-e) proliferation in normal mice. Based on these results, the ability of IL-6 to stimulate hematopoietic regeneration following radiation-induced hematopoietic injury was also evaluated. C3H/HeN female mice were exposed to 6.5 Gy 60Co radiation and subcutaneously administered either saline or IL-6 (1,000 micrograms/kg) on days 1 through 3 or 1 through 6 postexposure. On days 7, 10, 14, 17, and 22, femoral and splenic CFU-s, GM-CFC, and CFU-e contents and peripheral blood white cell, red cell, and platelet counts were determined. Compared with saline treatment, both 3-day and 6-day IL-6 treatments accelerated hematopoietic recovery; 6-day treatment produced the greater effects. For example, compared with normal control values (N), femoral and splenic CFU-s numbers in IL-6-treated mice 17 days postirradiation were 27% N and 136% N versus 2% N and 10% N in saline-treated mice. At the same time, bone marrow and splenic GM-CFC values were 58% N and 473% N versus 6% N and 196% N in saline-treated mice; bone marrow and splenic CFU-e numbers were 91% N and 250% N versus 31% N and 130% N in saline-treated mice; and peripheral blood white cell, red cell, and platelet values were 210% N, 60% N, and 24% N versus 18% N, 39% N, and 7% N in saline-treated mice. These studies demonstrate that therapeutically administered IL-6 can effectively accelerate multilineage hematopoietic recovery following radiation-induced hematopoietic injury.\r"

Recently, the possibility that cells of megakaryocytic lineage are susceptible to HIV infection has been raised. We have characterized infection of the permanent megakaryocytic cell line CMK by HIV in vitro. CMK cells were easily infected by HIV type 2 (HIV-2), producing significant amounts of virus in culture. Infection appeared to be mediated by the CD4 surface antigen on CMK cells. Three different strains of HIV-1 were able to minimally infect CMK cells, suggesting there may be isolates of HIV tropic for megakaryocytes. Infection of CMK cells led to downregulation of the CD4 surface antigen but no discernable change in expression of megakaryocyte-associated proteins glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. These observations support the likelihood that megakaryocytes are susceptible to HIV infection, and cell lines of megakaryocytic origin may provide a useful model to study effects of the retrovirus on megakaryocyte function.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and G-CSF to influence hematopoiesis in long-term cultures (LTC) of human marrow was studied by cocultivating light density normal human marrow cells with human marrow fibroblast feeders engineered by retroviral infection to constitutively produce one of these growth factors. Feeders producing stable levels of 4 ng/mL GM-CSF or 20 ng/mL G-CSF doubled the output of mature nonadherent cells. The numbers of both colony forming unit-GM (CFU-GM) and erythroid burst forming unit (BFU-E) in the G-CSF LTC were also increased (twofold and fourfold, respectively, after 5 weeks in culture), but this effect was not seen with the GM-CSF feeders. At the time of the weekly half medium change 3H-thymidine suicide assays showed primitive adherent layer progenitors in LTC to be quiescent in both the control and GM-CSF cultures. In contrast, in the G-CSF cultures, a high proportion of primitive progenitors were in S-phase. A single addition of either recombinant GM-CSF or G-CSF to LTC in doses as high as 80 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL, respectively, failed to induce primitive progenitor cycling. However, three sequential daily additions of 150 ng/mL G-CSF did stimulate primitive progenitors to enter S-phase and a single addition of 5 or 12.5 ng/mL of G-CSF together with 10 ng/mL GM-CSF was able to elicit the same effect. Thus, selective elevation of G-CSF in human LTC stimulates proliferation of primitive clonogenic progenitors, which may then proceed through to the terminal stages of granulopoiesis. In contrast, the effects of GM-CSF in this system appear limited to terminally differentiating granulopoietic cells. However, when both GM-CSF and G-CSF are provided together, otherwise biologically inactive doses show strong stimulatory activity. These findings suggest that the production of both of these growth factors by normal stromal cells may contribute to the support and proliferation of hematopoietic cells, not only in LTC, but also in the microenvironment of the marrow in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91120951\r", 
  ".W": "In this study we show that high molecular weight kininogen (HK) inhibited alpha-thrombin-induced aggregation of human platelets in a dose-dependent manner with complete inhibition occurring at plasma concentration (0.67 mumol/L) of HK. HK (0.67 mumol/L) also completely inhibited thrombin-induced cleavage of aggregin (Mr = 100 Kd), a surface membrane protein that mediates adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced shape change, aggregation, and fibrinogen binding. The inhibition of HK was specific for alpha- and gamma-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, because HK did not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, calcium ionophore (A23187), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), PMA + A23187, or 9,11-methano derivative of prostaglandin H2 (U46619). These effects were explained by the ability of HK, at physiologic concentration, to completely inhibit binding of 125I-alpha-thrombin to washed platelets. As a result of this action of HK, this plasma protein also completely inhibited thrombin-induced secretion of adenosine triphosphate, blocked intracellular rise in Ca2+ in platelets exposed to alpha- and gamma-thrombin, inhibited thrombin-induced platelet shape change, and blocked the ability of thrombin to antagonize the increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels induced by iloprost. Because elevation of cAMP is known to inhibit binding of thrombin to platelets, we established that HK did not increase the intracellular concentration of platelet cAMP. Finally, HK did not inhibit enzymatic activity of thrombin. To study the role of HK in the plasma environment, we used gamma-thrombin to avoid fibrin formation by alpha-thrombin. Platelet aggregation induced by gamma-thrombin was also inhibited by HK in a dose-dependent manner. The EC50 (concentration to produce 50% of the maximum rate of aggregation) of gamma-thrombin for washed platelets was 7 nmol/L and increased to 102 nmol/L when platelets were suspended in normal human plasma. The EC50 for platelet aggregation induced by alpha-thrombin in plasma deficient in total kininogen was 40 nmol/L. When supplemented with HK at plasma concentration (0.67 mumol/L), the EC50 increased to 90 nmol/L, a value similar to that for normal human plasma. These results indicate that (1) HK inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and cleavage of aggregin by inhibiting binding of thrombin to platelets; (2) HK is a specific inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by alpha- and gamma-thrombin; and (3) HK plays a role in modulating platelet aggregation stimulated by alpha-thrombin in plasma.\r"

  ".W": "The respective role of plasmatic and endothelial extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated von Willebrand factor (vWF) in platelet adhesion was investigated at a high shear rate using a parallel-plate perfusion chamber. Incubation of the endothelial ECM with a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to vWF, which specifically blocks vWF binding to platelet GP Ib (MoAb 322), inhibited 45% of platelet adhesion. Complete inhibition was achieved by incubating both plasma and endothelial ECM with MoAb 322 at concentrations that blocked only about 50% of adhesion when added separately. The effect of ECM-associated vWF was further demonstrated when a fibroblastic ECM, normally devoid of vWF, was coated with purified plasmatic vWF. Matrix associated-vWF was able to significantly enhance platelet adhesion in both the presence and the absence of plasmatic vWF. In contrast, this effect was not seen on endothelial ECM. Binding of exogenous vWF to the ECM was specific and dose dependent, reached the same value (500 ng/cm2) on both fibroblastic ECM and endothelial ECM, but exhibited a threefold-lower apparent dissociation constant (KD) on fibroblastic than on endothelial ECM. Our studies suggest that vWF deposited by endothelial cells in the ECM may be the most active form in platelet adhesion, whereas plasmatic vWF may only play a secondary role.\r"

  ".W": "The procoagulant properties of cultured vascular endothelial cells are enhanced in response to inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). A major component of this response is a reduction in expression of thrombomodulin, a cell surface cofactor for the activation of protein C. Regulation of thrombomodulin expression by TNF has been reported to occur through multiple mechanisms. To determine the relative roles of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, the effect of TNF on the turnover of thrombomodulin protein and mRNA was examined in human and bovine endothelial cells. Quantitative nuclease S1 protection assays showed a 70% to 90% reduction in thrombomodulin mRNA within 4 hours of the addition of 1.0 nmol/L TNF to the culture medium. The decrease in thrombomodulin mRNA resulted from inhibition of transcription, followed by rapid degradation of thrombomodulin transcripts (t1/2 less than or equal to 3 hours). In pulse-chase incubations, thrombomodulin synthesis decreased parallel with mRNA, but the rate of degradation of radiolabeled thrombomodulin was not significantly altered by TNF. Human thrombomodulin was degraded with a t1/2 of 8.2 +/- 2.4 hours (SD) or 7.5 +/- 1.3 hours (SD) in the absence or presence of TNF, respectively. We conclude that TNF acts primarily to inhibit thrombomodulin transcription. The subsequent decrease in activity results from the inherent instability of thrombomodulin mRNA and protein in these cells, and not from the regulation of thrombomodulin degradation.\r"

Protein S-deficient members of families A and B possessed identical restriction fragment length polymorphisms, which suggest the absence of 5.3 kb from one of their protein S alpha alleles. The abnormal alleles from individuals A7 and B1 were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using a forward primer in intron K and a reverse primer in exon XIV. The amplified DNA was cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparison with the normal protein S alpha gene showed that most of intron L (roughly 4.7 kb), the entire exon XIII (151 bp), and about a quarter of intron M (407 bp) were missing from both the A7 and B1 clones. Exon XIII contains all three potential N-glycosylation sites in human protein S. This deletion may result in RNA transcripts in which exon XII is spliced to exon XIV. Such an arrangement would generate a stop codon at position 463 and consequently produce a nonglycosylated protein S molecule truncated by 173 amino acids.\r"

We studied the developmental expression of the mRNA for two alpha granule proteins, fibronectin (FN) and fibrinogen gamma chain (gamma-FIB), and a cytoskeletal protein, actin, in MKs from marrow of Sprague-Dawley rats. By the method of in situ RNA:RNA hybridization, we showed that mRNAs for the alpha granule proteins were expressed most abundantly in a population of 15-microns diameter promegakaryocytes and in cells as small as 10 microns whose identity as immature MKs was inferred by positive staining for platelet- and MK-specific markers. gamma-FIB and FN mRNAs were present in reduced abundance in a small proportion of intermediate MKs; however, little or no expression was seen in mature platelet-producing MKs. In contrast, high levels of actin mRNA were expressed predominantly in mature, multi-nucleated MKs, and less abundantly in the immature forms. These results suggest that FN and gamma-FIB are transcribed early in MK development to permit translation and packaging of the protein into alpha granules, after which transcription ceases. On the other hand, transcription of actin occurs continuously throughout development, with highest levels in mature platelet-producing MKs, in which actin is needed for shape changes and intracellular movement of organelles. Our data suggest that in situ RNA:RNA hybridization for platelet-specific markers will provide additional criteria by which to establish MK lineage in immature marrow progenitors.\r"

Mast cell suspensions were examined after stimulation with anti-IgE to produce anaphylactic degranulation or examined in buffer-incubated controls. Histamine release was measured in replicate samples. Control, isolated HSMC studied by electron microscopy were well preserved and fully granulated. Although all granule patterns reported for human mast cells were found, crystal granules were the most prevalent, as is true for HSMC in situ. Individual mast cells containing both crystal and scroll granules occurred. Lipid bodies were rare, as in HSMC in situ. Control, isolated mast cells did not express granule changes associated with either piecemeal degranulation or recovery during wound healing in situ; nor were morphologic changes of anaphylactic degranulation present. Spontaneous histamine release was 0% in control samples. Anaphylactic degranulation of isolated HSMC was accompanied by 24% maximum histamine release and characteristically showed extrusion of altered, membrane-free granules through multiple pores in the plasma membrane to the exterior of the cell. Other morphologic aspects of anaphylactic degranulation, as expressed in isolated human lung mast cells, were also present. These events included granule swelling, fusion, alteration of matrix contents, degranulation channel formation, pore formation, and shedding of granules, membranes, and surface processes. The ultrastructural morphology of isolated HSMC and their IgE-mediated degranulation shows some differences from similar studies of isolated human lung mast cells and of human lung and gut mast cells in biopsy samples. These differences include crystal granules as the predominant granule pattern, minor numbers of lipid bodies, and extrusion of granules during anaphylactic degranulation as characteristic for HSMC. By contrast, isolated human lung and gut mast cells have more scroll granules and particle granules, respectively, and more lipid bodies. In isolated human lung mast cells, anaphylactic degranulation is almost exclusively an intracellular fusion event characterized by the formation of complex degranulation channels within which altered granule matrix materials solubilize. In addition to morphologic differences between mast cells of skin, lung, or gut origin, functional differences have also been reported among mast cells of these organs. The ultrastructural morphology of isolated HSMC is identical to that of skin mast cells in biopsy samples, thereby validating the usefulness of this new source of HSMC for correlative functional and morphologic studies.\r"

Northern blot analysis showed that appreciable levels of hsp70 mRNA are present in monocytes and granulocytes, whereas transcript levels were barely detectable or absent in lymphocytes. Monocytes functionally activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed an early (15 minutes) increase of hsp70 transcripts that was shown, by actinomycin D blocking and nuclear run-off experiments, to be dependent on transcriptional activation of the gene. LPS did not appreciably affect the hsp70 mRNA half-life. Monocytes exposed to inactivated streptococci, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, and tumor necrosis factor showed augmented levels of hsp70 transcripts, whereas interferon-gamma and monocyte, granulocyte, and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factors had no effect. Adherence to plastic augmented hsp70 expression in monocytes. S1 protection analysis indicated that the gene expressed in monocytes is indeed a heat-inducible member of the hsp70 gene family rather than a constitutively expressed heat-shock cognate gene. Western blot analysis showed that a heat-inducible HSP72 was present in monocytes and, at augmented levels, in LPS-treated monocytes. LPS-activated monocytes were more resistant to heat shock than unstimulated cells. These data indicate that a heat-inducible hsp70 gene can be efficiently expressed in myelomonocytic cells at physiologic temperatures. Expression of hsp70 genes in monocytes suggests a possible role of heat-inducible genes in the differentiation and/or functional activation of terminally differentiated nonproliferating elements of the myelomonocytic lineage.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported recently that freshly isolated human myeloma cell cultures proliferate in response to added interleukin-6 (IL-6). Endogenous levels of IL-6 found in the same cultures suggested that an autocrine growth loop may contribute to cell growth. However, the lack of homogenous cell populations in primary myeloma cultures has made it difficult to distinguish between paracrine and autocrine growth mechanisms. To precisely address the autocrine growth issue we have evaluated the growth of the human myeloma cell line, U266. We have found that a neutralizing anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody can inhibit U266 proliferation. Furthermore, the addition of IL-6 antisense oligonucleotides also inhibits U266 proliferation. These effects are reversed by adding IL-6, suggesting the presence of an autocrine loop. Using bioassays with two different IL-6-dependent cell lines, we were able to detect IL-6 in concentrated U266 supernatants. IL-6 mRNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA. Cell cycle parameter analysis shows that IL-6 acts to release a block in G1. Taken together these results present conclusive evidence for IL-6-mediated autocrine growth in the U266 human myeloma cell line.\r"

However, little is known about the incidence or importance of these genetic mutations in childhood myeloproliferative states (MPS). The bone marrow (BM) monosomy 7 syndrome accounts for a large percentage of childhood MPS. Although the duration of the MPS is quite variable, children with monosomy 7 eventually develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We investigated 20 children (13 with MPS, 7 with AML) with BM monosomy 7 or 7q- for the presence of ras gene mutations using the polymerase chain reaction and hybridization with mutation-specific oligonucleotides. Mutations of N-ras and K-ras were detected in three children. Two patients carrying a ras mutation were in the myeloproliferative phase, and one had acute leukemia. All three patients with ras mutations either died of their disease or relapsed after BM transplantation as compared with 8 of 17 without ras mutations. However, this difference is not statistically significant (P = .14, not significant). We conclude that ras mutations are observed in childhood monosomy 7, though less frequently than in adult MDS, and may play a limited role in the progression of this disease to acute leukemia. More patients are needed to address the prognostic role of ras mutations in this rare disease.\r"

We have now characterized its genomic organization and identified the major transcriptional start site to lie within an initiator-like motif. Ttg-1 is normally expressed in mouse brain and not in thymus. The mouse neuroblastoma cell line, N2a, also expresses Ttg-1. Antibodies raised against a TrpE-Ttg-1 fusion protein precipitate an 18-Kd nuclear protein from metabolically labeled 8402 cells. Immunofluorescence of N2a cells shows a nuclear pattern. The two potential zinc finger domains in Ttg-1 are highly homologous to similar regions in lin-11, mec-3, and lsl-1. This data suggests that Ttg-1 may be involved in gene regulation.\r"

We studied the activation of the human PMN oxidative burst and stimulated fluid pinocytosis induced by three monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed against Fc gamma RI (CD64) to study the role of this receptor in Fc-mediated cellular activation. All three MoAbs were capable of triggering PMN activation from IFN-gamma-treated PMN when cross-linked with goat antimurine Ig reagents. However, MoAb 197 alone demonstrated a concentration-dependent activation of the oxidative burst without the use of a second cross-linking antibody. The oxidative burst and stimulated fluid pinocytosis responses induced by monomeric MoAb 197 could be elicited only after the IFN-gamma induction of approximately 8,000 Fc gamma RI receptor equivalents and did not occur in freshly isolated or control-cultured PMN. Competitive blocking of Fc binding of MoAb 197 by human IgG or purified Fc fragments inhibited cellular activation. We believe the ability of MoAb 197 to activate these oxidative burst and fluid pinocytic responses was because of its murine IgG2a subclass, which allowed it to function as a trivalent anti-Fc gamma RI antibody binding through the combination of its two FAB regions and the Fc domain. This study demonstrates that the cross-linking of CD64 can activate PMN oxidative and endocytic responses and supports a role for Fc gamma RI in the human neutrophil inflammatory response.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the quantitative relationship between two natural serum antibodies, anti-band 3 and anti-alpha-galactosyl (anti-Gal), in their capacity to bind to human red blood cell (RBC) populations separated on density gradients. The question was approached in two ways. First, we determined the extent of rebinding of affinity-purified human serum antibodies to RBCs that had been stripped of in situ antibody. Second, we eluted the in situ bound antibody at low pH from density-separated RBCs and determined the proportion of total eluted antibody that bound specifically to erythrocyte band 3 or to a Gal-alpha-(1,3)-Gal structure. Our results show that high-density human RBCs bind increased amounts of both antibodies. Anti-Gal rebinding was specific, because it was saturable and occurred in the presence of serum IgG depleted of anti-Gal. Binding assays using control natural autoantibodies directed against antigens not found on the RBC surface showed that high-density RBCs also bind increased amounts of these antibodies as compared with low-density RBCs. However, the extent of this binding is substantially lower than that of anti-band 3 and anti-Gal. Binding studies using the lectins Bandeiraea Simplicifolia (alpha-galactosyl specific) and Arachis Hypogaea (peanut agglutinin, beta-galactosyl specific) indicated that only the alpha-galactosyl sites are exposed on high density RBCs, and not the beta-galactosyl structure characteristic of T antigen. Antibody that is eluted at low pH from high density RBCs contains a 5.0% to 18.0% component that binds to band 3 protein, and a 9.1% to 39.0% component that recognizes the alpha-galactosyl structure. Together, the two antibodies appear to constitute an average of 35% (range 17.2% to 57.4%) of the in situ bound antibody from high-density human RBCs.\r"

  ".U": "91120968\r", 
  ".W": "The antimalaria effect of iron chelators is attributed to their interaction with a labile iron pool within parasitised erythrocytes, and it was postulated that increased affinity to iron as well as increased lipophilicity may improve antimalarial activity. In the present study we have examined the antimalarial effect of 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones, a family of bidentate orally effective iron chelators whose lipophilicity may be modified by altering the length of the R2 substituent on the ring nitrogen. A significant dose-related suppression of Plasmodium falciparum cultures was observed with all drugs tested in vitro at concentrations of 5 mumol/L or higher. In contrast, there was a clear segregation of the in vivo effect on P berghei in rats (300 mg/kg/d subcutaneous) into two categories: compounds CP20, 38, and 40 failed to suppress malaria, whereas CP51, 94, and 96 had a strong antimalarial effect, similar or better than deferoxamine. There was a close linear correlation between the suppression of peak parasite counts and the reduction in hepatic nonheme iron induced by the various drugs tested (r = .9837). The most lipophilic compounds were also the most effective in suppressing malaria and in depleting hepatic iron stores. These data indicate that 3-hydroxypyrydin-4-ones are able to suppress malaria in vivo and in vitro. Because lipid solubility is an important determinant of antimalarial action, our study provides useful information regarding the selection of orally effective iron-chelating compounds that may be suitable for clinical application as antimalarial agents.\r"

  ".U": "91120969\r", 
  ".W": "Human erythrocyte glycophorin C plays a functionally important role in maintaining erythrocyte shape and regulating membrane mechanical stability. Immunochemical and serologic studies have identified a number of glycophorin C variants that include the Yus, Gerbich, and Webb phenotypes. We report here the molecular characterization of these variants. Amplification of glycophorin C mRNA from the Yus phenotype, using two oligonucleotide primers that span the coding domain, generated a 338-bp fragment compared with a 395-bp fragment generated by amplification of normal glycophorin C mRNA. Sequencing of the mutant 338-bp fragment identified a 57-bp deletion that corresponds to exon 2 of the glycophorin C gene. Similar analysis showed deletion of 84-bp exon 3 in the Gerbich phenotype. In contrast to the generation of shorter than normal DNA fragments from mRNA amplification in the Yus and Gerbich phenotypes, amplification of mRNA from the Webb phenotype generated a normal-sized fragment. Sequencing of this DNA fragment showed an A----G substitution at nucleotide 23 of the coding sequence, resulting in the substitution of asparagine by serine. This modification accounts for the altered glycosylation of glycophorin C seen in this phenotype. These results have enabled us to characterize glycophorin C variants in three different phenotypes that involve deletions of exons 2 and 3 of the glycophorin C gene, as well as a point mutation in exon 1 that results in altered glycosylation of this protein.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of an immunologic antileukemia reaction associated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is well established. However, a similar graft-versus-tumor effect against lymphomas has not been demonstrated. We analyzed the results of BMT in 118 consecutive patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease or aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The 38 patients less than 50 years of age with HLA-matched donors had allogenic marrow transplants, and the other 80 patients received purged autologous grafts. The median age was 26 years in both the allogeneic and the autologous graft recipients. The patient's response to conventional salvage therapy before transplant was the only factor that influenced the event-free survival after BMT (P less than .001). Both the patient's response to salvage therapy before BMT (P less than .001) and the type of graft (P = .02) significantly influenced the probability of relapse after BMT. The actuarial probability of relapse in patients who responded to conventional salvage therapy before BMT was only 18% after allogenic BMT compared with 46% after autologous BMT. However, the actuarial probability of event-free survival at 4 years was the same, 47% versus 41%, for patients with responsive lymphomas who received allogeneic and autologous transplants, respectively (P = .8). The beneficial antitumor effect of allogeneic BMT was offset by its higher transplant-related mortality (P = .01), largely resulting from graft-versus-host disease. Allogeneic BMT appears to induce a clinically significant graft-versus-lymphoma effect. The magnitude of this effect is similar to that reported against leukemias.\r"

  ".W": "The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect residual malignant disease before and after ex vivo purging with monoclonal antibodies and complement or immunomagnetic treatment of BM samples contaminated with known numbers of t(14;18)-carrying tumor cells. Sensitivity of the PCR was demonstrated by detecting a specific t(14;18) amplification product in DNA extracted from a preparation consisting of one tumor cell among 10(5) normal cells. When BM contaminated with 1% to 5% t(14;18)-carrying cells from the B-cell lymphoma line SU-DHL-4 was subjected to two rounds of anti-B-cell pool of antibodies and complement (Ab-C) treatment a 3- to 4-log reduction of the pretreatment PCR signal was observed. A similar log-cell kill was detected using an independent clonogenic assay confirming the utility of the PCR approach. BM contaminated with a second B-cell lymphoma cell line, OCI-Ly8, was more resistant because a third cycle of Ab-C treatment was required to obtain a similar reduction in the PCR signal. A similar 4 logs of tumor cell removal was obtained using anti-B-cell antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads. These studies demonstrate that the t(14;18) PCR can be used to detect levels of tumor cells as low as 0.001%. This approach can be used to determine the effectiveness of BM purging in patients undergoing autologous BM transplantation as well as to assess the biologic role of minimal marrow disease.\r"

  ".U": "91120972\r", 
  ".W": "Murine bone marrow chimera models were used to assess the efficacy of host total body irradiation (TBI) given at different doses, dose rates, and fractionation schemes in providing for engraftment of syngeneic and allogeneic bone marrow. B6-Hbbd congenic and LP mice, respectively, were used as donors (10(7) bone marrow cells) for syngeneic and allogenic (H-2 compatible) transplantation in standard B6 recipients. Stable marrow chimerism was determined from host and donor stem cell-derived hemoglobin phenotypes (Hbbs and Hbbd) on gel electrophoresis at 3 months posttransplant. Partial engraftment of syngeneic marrow was seen at single doses as low as 2 Gy, with the donor component increasing steadily with increasing TBI dose to a level of 100% at 7 Gy. Immunologic resistance of the host appeared to prevent allogeneic engraftment until 5.5 Gy. A very steep radiation dose response was then observed so that the level of chimerism with 6 Gy and above became comparable with syngeneic engraftment. Low dose rate (5 cGy minute-1) and fractionated TBI required higher total doses for equivalent engraftment (radiation dose-sparing) in both syngeneic and allogenic bone marrow transplantation. This displacement in the dose-response curve on fractionation was seen with interfraction intervals of 3 and 6 hours. A further dose-sparing effect was observed on extending the interval to 18 and 24 hours, but only for allogeneic transplantation, and may therefore be related to recovery of immune-mediated graft resistance. The involvement of multiple target cell populations in determining allogenic engraftment rendered the application of the linear-quadratic model for radiation cell survival problematic in this case. The recovery in dose when low dose rate and 6-hour interfraction intervals were applied in either syngeneic or allogeneic BMT is consistent with appreciable sub-lethal damage repair in the primitive self-renewing stem cell population of the host marrow. These results contrast with the poor repair capacity of the 11-day spleen colony-forming units (CFUs) population after fractionated irradiation and support the notion that ablation of early stem cells in the pre-CFUs compartment is essential for long-term marrow engraftment.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective audit of letters submitted for publication in the correspondence columns of the BMJ in response to articles published between 1 January and 21 May 1989. SUBJECTS--A total of 1319 letters received by the journal, 974 submitted in response to the 1501 published articles and a further 345 raising new issues. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The total numbers of letters submitted in response to the four main sections of the journal--editorials, news, papers, and middles--and the numbers published. Submitted and published letters were analysed according to whether they agreed or disagreed with articles. RESULTS--The overall rejection rate was 63% (831/1319), but among letters relating to articles it was 56% (543/974). Editorials and middles attracted proportionately more letters than papers, but letters relating to papers had a lower rejection rate (43% v 57% for editorials and 43% v 66% for middles). For all sections more letters disagreed than agreed, but a higher proportion of letters in response to editorials and middles disagreed than those submitted in response to papers (64% and 72% v 53%). Among the published letters, however, broadly equal numbers of letters agreed and disagreed with articles, irrespective of section. CONCLUSION--Those sections of the journal that aim at stimulating debate succeeded in attracting the most comment. The relative importance of original scientific research papers was reflected by the priority given to letters submitted in response to papers, and the final correspondence column was a balanced platform of debate despite an unequal submitted response in terms of letters that agreed and disagreed with different sections of the journal.\r"

SETTING--All maternity units in England and Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Type of general practitioner unit (if any); number of bookings, transfers, and deliveries by general practitioners; participation of general practitioners in the policy and audit of the unit. RESULTS--277 (93%) of 297 units replied. Of 611,644 deliveries, 36,043 (5.9%) were under general practitioner care. In all, 228 units permitted general practitioners to book women under their sole care: 65 were isolated, 29 alongside, and 134 integrated general practitioner units. Alongside units had significantly more bookings (568), antenatal transfers (69), intrapartum transfers (86), and deliveries (387) compared with isolated units (185, 18, 16, and 125, respectively) and integrated units (106, 18, 18, and 52) (p less than 0.001 for all differences). The percentage of women booked by general practitioners transferred either before or during labour was independent of both the type of unit and the number of general practitioner bookings. General practitioners in consultant units were significantly less likely to attend meetings reviewing perinatal mortality (p less than 0.01), and these units were less likely to have any form of general practitioner-consultant liaison committee (p less than 0.001) compared with general practitioner units as a whole. Compared with those in isolated and alongside units, general practitioners in integrated units were less likely to have taken part in deciding the unit's booking policy (p less than 0.01) and consultants more likely to be the final determinant of whether a general practitioner should be permitted to practice within the unit (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS--Both the number of deliveries booked by general practitioners and the number of isolated general practitioner units have fallen. Transfer from general practitioner to consultant care was independent of the general practitioner unit's caseload or the type of unit. General practitioner units differ from consultant units in important ways and differ among themselves as well. Except in remote areas, alongside units may be the ideal type of unit to encourage general practitioners to continue to provide intrapartum care.\r"

DESIGN--Analysis of linked, routine abstracts of hospital inpatient records for accidents. SETTING--Six districts in the Oxford Regional Health Authority covered by the Oxford record linkage study. SUBJECTS--Records for 19,427 children aged 5 years and under at the time of first recorded admission to hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Number of admissions to hospital. RESULTS--Records were analysed in three groups: person based annual admission rates were calculated for each calendar year; each child's first recorded admission in 1976-85 was identified, and the child's record was followed up by linkage for one year from that admission; each child's first recorded admission in 1976-81 was identified and followed up for five years. Overall, 19,427 children from an average annual resident population of 163,000 children in 1976-86 had 20,657 admissions for accidents before they were 6 years of age. Of these admissions 13,983 were for injuries, 5717 for poisonings, and 957 for burns. Admission rates declined after 1976 for poisoning, but no substantial changes over time were found in admission rates for injuries or burns. A total of 17,724 children were followed up for one year and 10,889 for five years; 470 (2.6%) of the children who were followed up for one year and 926 (8.5%) of those followed up for five years had at least one further admission for an accident. Of those followed up for one year the 4 and 5 year old children were least likely and those under 1 and 1 year old were most likely to have a further admission for an accident. The number of children who had more than one accident was greater than would be expected if accidents were random occurrences. Those who had a poisoning at first admission were more likely to have another poisoning than an injury or burn; and those who had a burn at first admission were more likely to have another burn. CONCLUSIONS--Hospital admissions for accidents in children are common: on average 1 child in 88 in this population was admitted each year. Multiple admissions are uncommon but none the less occur more often than would be expected by chance.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the effects of cigarette smoking on alcohol absorption and gastric emptying. DESIGN--Randomised crossover study. SETTING--Research project in departments of medicine and nuclear medicine. SUBJECTS--Eight healthy volunteers aged 19-43 who regularly smoked 20-35 cigarettes a day and drank small amounts of alcohol on social occasions. INTERVENTIONS--Subjects drank 400 ml of a radiolabelled nutrient test meal containing alcohol (0.5 g/kg), then had their rates of gastric emptying measured. Test were carried out (a) with the subjects smoking four cigarettes an hour and (b) with the subjects not smoking, having abstained for seven days or more. The order of the tests was randomised and the tests were conducted two weeks apart. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Peak blood alcohol concentrations, absorption of alcohol at 30 minutes, amount of test meal emptied from the stomach at 30 minutes, and times taken for 50% of the meal to leave the proximal stomach and total stomach. RESULTS--Smoking was associated with reductions in (a) peak blood alcohol concentrations (median values in non-smoking versus smoking periods 13.5 (range 8.7-22.6) mmol/l v 11.1 (4.3-13.5) mmol/l), (b) area under the blood alcohol concentration-time curve at 30 minutes (264 x 10(3) (0-509 x 10(3)) mmol/l/min v 140 x 10(3)) (0-217 x 10(3) mmol/l/min), and (c) amount of test meal emptied from the stomach at 30 minutes (39% (5-86%) v 23% (0-35%)). In addition, smoking slowed both the 50% gastric emptying time (37 (9-83) minutes v 56 (40-280) minutes) and the intragastric distribution of the meal. There was a close correlation between the amount of test meal emptied from the stomach at 30 minutes and the area under the blood alcohol concentration-time curve at 30 minutes (r = 0.91; p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSION--Cigarette smoking slows gastric emptying and as a consequence delays alcohol absorption.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study the need for and effectiveness of a ward based opportunistic immunisation policy. DESIGN--A six month prospective study. SETTING--An acute medical paediatric ward of an inner city teaching hospital. SUBJECTS--296 children admitted to the ward who lived within Central Manchester Health Authority boundaries and were aged from 5 months to 6 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Completion of immunisation schedule appropriate for age. RESULTS--56 children were three or more months behind with immunisations. The parent's history was not reliable for 18 children. Accessing health authority immunisation records was not difficult. The main reasons for falling behind were the mobility of the families (15 children), lack of motivation (14), and frequent minor illnesses (9). 40 children were immunised before discharge, but three could not be because of valid contraindications. Of the 16 children requiring more immunisations after discharge, only four obtained them at the correct time and five children not at all. CONCLUSION--An opportunistic immunisation policy is an important means of immunising a vulnerable group of children who would often default on routine immunisations, and such policies should operate whenever possible. Our ward based policy can achieve immunisation of three quarters of possible children without change or inconvenience to the daily ward work, but efficacy relies on adequate levels of enthusiastic staff. The system can be improved by having accurate and updated immunisation records available in the hospital, and by encouraging nursing staff to participate.\r"

Two families were characterized by premature-onset polyarticular CC with little associated structural arthropathy. In one of these families, recurrent childhood fits were strongly associated with subsequent development of CC. Affected members of the other three families resembled sporadic disease in showing predominantly late-onset, oligoarticular CC with mild arthritis and destructive change in only one case. Knee synovial fluid levels of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphate (NTPP) did not differ from those of 59 sporadic cases of CC due to CPPD, although PPi and NTPP levels in both groups were higher than in normal knee synovial fluid (P less than 0.0001). Urinary PPi levels were not different from normal controls. Screening for other metabolic abnormality was negative in all cases. This is the first report of familial CC in the UK, and the first to associate this condition with childhood fits. Absence of overt primary abnormality of PPi metabolism suggests that other factors relating to crystal nucleation/growth may be more relevant to predisposition in these cases.\r"

Presence of these antibodies correlated strongly with a previous history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and to the severity of NSAID-related dyspeptic symptoms, the latter often leading to multiple drug intolerance. This contrasts with short term, prospective NSAID toxicity data, which show little relationship between ulceration and HP carriage. This result suggests, however, that HP may have a definite role in the pathogenesis of symptomatic PUD associated with more chronic NSAID usage, and may have important implications for ulcer prophylaxis in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Transferrin (Tf) subtypes were investigated in 128 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the frequencies of TfC subtypes were compared with the results in normal individuals. The frequencies of the Tf genes: C1, C2, C3, D1, and D2 were 0.4765, 0.3867, 0.0742, 0.0390 and 0.0234, respectively. The frequency of TfC2 gene was significantly higher in these patients (0.3867) compared to the value in the control group (C2 = 0.247). The relative risk of RA in association with TfC1C2 type was 2.0, while it was 0.18 in association with TfC1C1 type and the results were statistically significant. This paper confirms the significant association between TfC2 and RA. Furthermore, it appears from our results that TfC1 homozygous phenotype is protective for the development of RA. The results are discussed in the light of earlier suggestions that the TfC2 subtype confers an increased risk of cellular damage by enhancing hydroxyl radical formation, although it is possible that there exists a genetic linkage of Tf variant to some other locus which is influencing susceptibility to RA.\r"

Adjusted for the population structure, the prevalence was 8.4 per thousand adults. Complementary data are also presented on cases of RA ascertained by special screening clinics in rural health centres and by hospital rheumatology clinics. In all parts of the study, cases of RA were less often seropositive than in European populations which may account for the lower prevalence of erosive disease.\r"

It is concluded that many of the currently used measurements are either statistically unreliable or clinically unhelpful in mild or moderate ankylosing spondylitis. The most clinically useful were cervical rotation using a protractor, cervical lateral flexion using a goniometer, thoracolumbar flexion as the C7 to iliac crest line distraction, thoracolumbar lateral flexion as the fingertip to floor distance and the modified Schober index.\r"

Septic arthritis is one infectious complication known to be overrepresented in RA. We studied the impact of disease severity and medication in a group of nine RA patients with proven septic arthritis, excluding those occurring as a complication of orthopaedic surgery. Two control groups were used for comparison. The septic arthritis patients were functionally more incapacitated and more often treated with cytotoxic drugs. Six of the nine septic arthritis patients had received an intra-articular injection into the infected joint within 3 months prior to the onset of the septic arthritis. Only one of these occurred immediately after arthrocentesis. The annual frequency of septic arthritis was approximately 0.2%. During the 4-year period studied the frequency was 0.5%. When related to the number of glucocorticosteroid injections, a frequency of 1 per 2000 injections was found when late septic arthritis was included. The high frequency of delayed septic arthritis after intra-articular glucocorticosteroid administration should alert physicians to this complication.\r"

  ".W": "Corticosteroid injections are the mainstay of treating tennis elbow even though their effectiveness has not been well established by controlled studies. A survey of consultant rheumatologists confirmed a widespread preference for this treatment but they varied in their choice of steroid dose and preparation. We examined the value of some practices by comparing local injections of 2 ml 1% lignocaine with either 10 mg triamcinolone or 25 mg hydrocortisone made up to 2 ml with 1% lignocaine (Study 1). The investigation was conducted double blind. Within the first 8 weeks, pain relief was greater for triamcinolone than hydrocortisone although the differences were not statistically significant. The response to both steroid preparations was significantly better than for lignocaine up to this point but at 24 weeks, the degrees of improvement were similar for all three groups and many patients still had pain. Relapse was common. In a separate but similarly designed study, triamcinolone 10 mg was compared with 20 mg of the same agent. Improvements of pain were similar and followed the same time scale. Post-injection worsening of pain occurred in approximately half of all steroid treated patients in both studies and this was sometimes severe and persistent. It was less frequent amongst those given lignocaine alone. Skin atrophy was reported in all groups but was more frequent amongst those given triamcinolone in Study 1. In conclusion, more rapid relief of symptoms was achieved with 10 mg triamcinolone than with 25 mg hydrocortisone or lignocaine alone and there was less needed to repeat injections. Results obtained with 20 mg triamcinolone were similar to those of the smaller dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Test/re-test was used to test its stability (r = 0.81), and Kuder Richardson formula 20 (r = 0.72) for internal consistency. Seventy randomly selected RA patients then completed the PKQ in a rheumatology out-patient clinic of a large teaching hospital. There was a wide variation in total scores ranging from 3 to 28 out of 30. Total scores correlated with years of general education (P less than 0.05) but not with disease duration or age. Sixty-two per cent of patients knew that the cause of RA is, as yet, unknown but 27% thought it could be caused by injury and 11% by cold damp weather. Fifty-two per cent had no idea why they had blood tests. All but four patients were taking some form of medication but there was widespread confusion about disease-modifying drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Exercise was reasonably well understood but many patients were unable to differentiate between methods of energy conservation and joint protection. This study highlights the need for careful individual knowledge assessment by use of tools such as the PKQ and effective patient education programmes.\r"

Felty's subjects showed associations with the DQB encoded DQw7 allele and with the C4B null allele but no preferential associations with any Dw subtype of DR4. By contrast DR4 +ve rheumatoid-vasculitic subjects showed associations with the Dw14 as well as with DQw7 and the C4A null allele. These different MHC associations in different clinical disease subsets show that rheumatoid disease is immunogenetically heterogeneous and suggest that MHC genes outside the DRB1 locus may also influence susceptibility or modify expression of the rheumatoid disease process.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the hormonal changes of the menopause are related to the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), 53 healthy women, younger than 44 years, and subjected to bilateral oophorectomy between 1 and 4 years before the study, were evaluated. Seventy healthy menstruating women matched for age were used as controls. In those complaining of symptoms and presenting signs suggestive of CTS, sensory and motor nerve conduction studies were done. In the oophorectomized group, 17 of 53 (32%) had clinical CTS, while only seven of 70 of the control group (10%) did so (relative risk for the oophorectomized group = 4.25; 95% confidence intervals 1.47 and 12.61). The nerve conduction studies were abnormal in 14 of 16 oophorectomized women (87.5%), and in only one of seven of the control group (14.2%; P less than 0.002). Symptoms tended to be milder in the controls. Symptoms developed in the first year after oophorectomy in 14 of the 17 women with CTS. This suggests that women develop CTS after oophorectomy more frequently than controls.\r"

This study demonstrates (1) results of immunocytochemical and DNA-FCM analysis of FNA-derived material are comparable in the majority of cases to those obtained from surgical specimens, (2) immunostaining of cytospin preparations for immunoglobulin (Ig) gives less background staining and in certain cases is easier to interpret than when performed on frozen sections, and (3) monotypia in FNA in conjunction with cytomorphologic study is 100% specific for lymphoma, and polytypic staining for Ig does not exclude HD, T-cell lymphoma, or B-cell malignancy focally involving a lymph node.\r"

There were 29 lymphomas (15 small non-cleaved cell [SNCL], 11 large cell [LCL], one small lymphocytic, and two Hodgkin's), 14 reactive hyperplasias, and three \"atypical lymphoid proliferations.\" The reactive hyperplasias were characteristically polymorphic and polyclonal lymphoid populations; six of seven were diploid on FCM, the seventh was hypodiploid. Higher proliferative indices (mean, 11.6%) and higher RNA indices (mean, 1.2) characterized this subgroup compared with published reactive lymphoid hyperplasias from patients without HIV positivity. Aspirates of SNCL showed monotonous populations of intermediate-sized cells except in one patient where a giant cell syncytial variant occurred. Nine of 13 SNCL aspirates showed light chain restriction. JH rearrangement revealed B-cell lineage in one aspirate in which immunocytochemical study was negative for Kappa, lambda, B1, and Leu-4. Nine of 12 SNCL were diploid; the mean proliferative index was 25.6% and the mean RNA index 2.3. Chromosomal translocations involving the c-myc locus were demonstrated in five of seven SNCL aspirates karyotyped. Five of eight LCL showed light chain restriction the remaining three showed null cell phenotype. Large cell lymphomas were diploid on tetraploid with the mean proliferative index of 22.0% and mean RNA index of 2.2. One of two LCL aspirates karyotyped demonstrated c-myc translocation. Despite the multiparameter approach, a definitive diagnosis could not be reached in three aspirates.\r"

A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 12 juvenile rhabdomyosarcomas in patients between the ages of 18 and 36 years is presented. There was a female:male ratio of 2:1. The orbit with or without contiguous paranasal sinus involvement, nasal cavity, sphenoid sinus, middle ear, and soft tissues of the neck and preauricular region were the primary sites. Seven tumors involved a parameningeal site and eight cases were alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas which together contributed to the adverse outcome. Only two patients were long-term, disease-free survivors. Six patients have died of tumor and two others are alive with persistent disease. Immunohistochemical study in 11 cases demonstrated reactivity for vimentin and muscle-specific actin (HHF-35) and desmin in ten cases. Juvenile rhabdomyosarcoma rarely presents in the head and neck of adults but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a small cell neoplasm in patients during the third and fourth decades of life.\r"

  ".W": "The clinicopathologic features of 60 patients with thymic carcinoma were studied. Patients ranged in age from 10 to 76 years (mean, 46), of whom 24 were females and 36 were males. Overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 56.6%, 40%, and 33.3%, respectively. The following morphologic features were correlated with survival: type of tumor margins; presence or absence of a lobular growth pattern; nuclear atypia; necrosis; mitotic activity; and histologic tumor type and grade. Eighty eight percent of patients with poorly circumscribed/infiltrating neoplasms died of their tumors as compared with 16.6% of patients with well-circumscribed neoplasms (P less than 0.0000). Of patients whose tumors had mitotic counts exceeding 10/10 high-power fields (HPF), 84.3% died, as compared with 21.4% of patients with lower mitotic counts (P less than 0.0000). Of patients whose tumors showed lack of lobular growth pattern, 91.6% died, as compared with 29% of those whose tumors had a lobular growth pattern (P less than 0.0000). Finally, 84.6% of patients whose tumors displayed a high-grade histology (lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, small cell/neuroendocrine carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, sarcomatid carcinoma, and anaplastic/undifferentiated carcinoma) died of tumor, as compared with 0% of patients whose tumors were of low-grade histology (well-differentiated squamous carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and basaloid carcinoma) (P less than 0.0000). Evaluation of the various treatment modalities used to treat these patients did not yield any statistically significant correlations with survival. Two clinically distinct groups of patients were identified: one after a relatively favorable clinical course with long survival, and one after a rapidly fatal outcome. The morphologic features of the tumors in these patients correlated well with their clinical behavior; histologic type (and the grade to which it was assigned) constituted the most reliable and important predictor of prognosis.\r"

In the first series of experiments, the three techniques were compared using bone marrow cells artificially mixed with a known amount of breast cancer cells, whereas in a second series bone marrow from breast cancer patients with bone metastases were used. The following results were obtained: When mixtures of the first series were analyzed, FC analysis detected from 1% to 10% of breast cancer cells in bone marrow (0.2% was a border line value), the morphologic method detected from 0.05% to 10%, and the immunocytochemic method, which was clearly superior, detected breast cancer cells in all mixtures (from 0.00025% to 10%). It was noted that, with both the morphologic and immunocytochemic methods, the percentage of breast cancer cells detected was 2 to 360 times higher than the percentage of added cells, and enrichment was inversely proportional to the percentage of added cells. This result could be a result of different separation of cells during centrifugation due to the different density of breast cancer cells. The superiority of the immunocytochemic method was confirmed in the second series of experiments.\r"

Early stromal invasion (Stage IA1) denotes the first invasive protrusions of a carcinoma in situ into the stroma. Microcarcinomas (Stage IA2) are small cancers a number of orders of magnitude larger than Stage IA1 lesions and with a maximum depth of invasion of 5 mm and a maximum horizontal spread of 7 mm; larger lesions are classified as Stage IB. This study reviews 486 patients previously classified as having Stage IA disease. This yielded 344 Stage IA1 and 101 Stage IA2 lesions; 41 cancers were reclassified as Stage IB. Three hundred nine, 89, and 38 patients were followed for greater than or equal to 5 years. One (0.3%) patient with Stage IA1 disease re-presented with Stage IIB disease 12 years after conization. Five (5.6%) patients with Stage IA2 lesions developed invasive recurrences; three died. None of the 38 patients reclassified as having a Stage IB lesion, including 16 who were treated conservatively, developed a recurrence. The FIGO classification is not a guideline for treatment. Stage IA1 lesions can be treated conservatively, but treatment in Stage IA2 must be individualized. Risk factors such as vascular space involvement and confluency are of high sensitivity but low specificity.\r"

Only two were initially recognized as LMS; the others had been diagnosed as malignant fibrous histiocytoma (two) and fibrosarcoma (one). The patients, four of whom were women, ranged in age from 32 to 70 years. Sites included proximal humerus (two), distal femur (two), and rib (one). All tumors presented with clinical and radiographic features consistent with a diagnosis of primary bone neoplasms, although one probably represented a solitary metastasis from a primary uterine LMS. Radiographs showed lytic bone destruction with a moth-eaten appearance, and three cases had soft tissue extension. Histologically, all tumors showed broad, interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with pleomorphic nuclei, frequent mitoses, and necrosis. Two cases had a focal storiform pattern and bizarre multinucleated cells, and two other cases had focally prominent osteoclast-like giant cells. Extensive immunoreactivity for muscle actin was seen in all cases and for desmin in three. In each case, electron microscopy showed definite smooth muscle differentiation including cytoplasmic filaments with densities. At this writing, two patients are free of disease (including the patient with a presumed metastasis), one is alive with locally recurrent disease, and two are dead of disease. Experience suggests that LMS of bone is a distinct clinicopathologic entity that may be more common than previously recognized. Application of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to nonmatrix-producing bone sarcomas should facilitate diagnosis of additional cases.\r"

  ".W": "Of 2947 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), treated during three consecutive studies of the Pediatric Oncology Group (1974-1986), 52 (1.8%) had Down's Syndrome (DS). Comparison of clinical and laboratory characteristics showed no significant differences in leukocyte count, racial distribution, sex ratio, platelet count, incidence of mediastinal mass, lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, or percentage of blood or bone marrow blasts for children with ALL with or without Down's Syndrome (DS-ALL or NDS-ALL, respectively). However, children with DS-ALL were slightly older at the time of presentation and had higher hemoglobin values. The relative frequency of each major immunophenotype (early pre-B, pre-B, T, or B) was also comparable for patients with or without DS. For this report, treatment regimens were categorized as either conventional (no consolidation therapy) or intensive. Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of DS, a higher leukocyte count, black race, or age older than 10 years was independently associated with a poorer event-free survival (EFS) for children treated with conventional chemotherapy. However, for the cohort of children who received intensive chemotherapy, DS was no longer an independent risk factor. In fact, event-free survival (EFS) was markedly improved to a level comparable with that observed in the children diagnosed as having NDS-ALL. On the other hand, serious toxicity, requiring interruption of treatment, was significantly more frequent in the intensively treated children with DS compared with similarly treated patients with NDS-ALL, although deaths resulting from toxicity occurred infrequently.\r"

The clinical course was chronic and characterized by chronic eczema, persistent peripheral blood eosinophilia, organomegaly, interstitial lung change, and pericarditis. Postmortem examination demonstrated a disseminated T-cell lymphoma involving the inguinal lymph node, liver, lung, and kidney. The findings of the current case suggest a possibility that certain abnormalities in this case of idiopathic HES per se may have triggered the development of malignant lymphoma, and it may represent a transition of idiopathic HES into a T-cell lymphoma. Other possible sequences are discussed. The development of T-cell malignancy in idiopathic HES in a girl is quite an unusual presentation.\r"

Fifty (46%) of the 108 patients had one or more hypersensitivity reactions. The risk of any child having an initial reaction over the cumulative dose range studied was 52% (95% confidence limits, 41% and 63%) for VM-26, compared with 34% (95% confidence limits, 24% and 44%) for VP-16. The risk of having an initial reaction to VM-26 or VP-16 was clearly related to the cumulative dose. This risk peaked at 1500 to 2000 mg/m2 for VM-26 and at 2000-3000 mg/m2 for VP-16. All reactions were Type 1 reactions according to the Gell and Coombs classification, characterized by urticaria, angioedema, flushing, rashes, or hypotension, and 86% of reactions were of Grade 1 or 2 severity according to standard criteria. There was no evidence of increasing clinical severity on repeated rechallenge with premedication, and no deaths occurred. The findings suggested that hypersensitivity reactions to epipodophyllotoxins in children with ALL are more common than previously reported, but only rarely constitute dose-limiting toxicity.\r"

The patient had extensive local recurrence comprising mainly the Schwann spindle cells within a year after complete piecemeal removal and died 15 months later after the initial presentation. The natural behavior of this tumor, as in other reported cases of malignant triton tumor, is extremely aggressive, unlike malignant schwannoma or glandular malignant schwannoma. The histogenesis of this tumor is likely to be from primitive neural crest cells, Schwann's cell precursors, or metaplastic malignant Schwann's cells.\r"

Studies have been reviewed, using methodologic standards for the critical appraisal of studies on prognosis, developed by Sackett and colleagues in the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). Few of the studies investigating psychosocial adjustment of women with breast cancer meet all of the criteria for reviewing studies of clinical course and prognosis. This review focuses the direction and methodologic rigor required in future investigations. In particular, studies are needed that employ prospective designs and that deliberately measure or control for the extraneous prognostic variables that may affect adjustment. Future investigations need to incorporate adequate precision in measurement so that measures of the psychosocial variables are objective, reliable, and valid.\r"

Valid data collection and analysis is problematic given that studies gather patients over many years. The charts of 56 women with Stages I, II, and III breast cancer, who were pregnant or within 1 year postpartum at the time of breast cancer diagnosis between 1960 and 1980, were analyzed. Patients with PA breast cancer were compared to nonpregnant women of comparable ages, who were treated at the same hospital, by the same physicians, and during the same period. Four patients were lost before 5-year follow-up, and one patient before 10-year follow-up. These five patients had distant metastases at the time they were lost to follow-up, and are considered to have died within that time. Across stages, patients with PA breast cancer have survival not significantly different from those patients with non-pregnancy-associated (non-PA) breast cancer.\r"

In a follow-up study they compared the efficacy and side effects of morphine in two groups of marrow transplant patients who controlled their own analgesic administration either by conventional bolus-dose, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or by adjusting the rate of continuous morphine infusion to increase or decrease their plasma morphine concentration. Patients controlling their morphine infusion rates (pharmacokinetically based patient-controlled analgesia [PKPCA] group) obtained more relief from oral mucositis pain than did patients using conventional PCA. Patients in the PKPCA group used more morphine than PCA patients and achieved superior pain relief without significant increases in side effects (e.g., nausea, mood changes, sedation). The authors conclude that PKPCA improves the management of prolonged, severe pain in marrow transplant patients and that this approach to patient-controlled analgesia may be useful in other types of persistent pain.\r"

Objective responses were seen in 50 of 119 (42%) TAM patients and 64 of 119 (54%) TAM plus FLU patients (two-sided P = 0.07). Time to disease progression was better for TAM plus FLU (medians: 11.6 versus 6.5 months; Cox model, P = 0.03). Duration of response and survival were similar in the two treatment arms. Among 97 patients with estrogen receptor (ER) of 10 or greater and 65 years of age or older, there were highly significant advantages for treatment with TAM plus FLU in both response rate and time to progression. Of particular note is that in this patient group TAM plus FLU showed a survival advantage (Cox model, P = 0.05). Although these data require confirmation in a prospective randomized trial, they suggest that there is a substantive therapeutic advantage for TAM plus FLU over TAM alone in elderly women with ER of 10 fmol or greater.\r"

One complete and 23 partial responses were observed, yielding an overall response rate of 60%. There was no significant difference in response rates based on histologic subtype or extent of disease (locally unresectable versus metastatic). Median duration of response was 6 months, and the median survival of all patients was 10 months. Two patients with unresectable disease at presentation became resectable after chemotherapy and remain disease-free at 46+ and 53+ months. Toxicity was modest, with oral mucositis the major adverse effect. Clinically important neutropenia was uncommon. PFM is an active regimen in NSCCL and deserves further study in the \"neoadjuvant\" setting.\r"

  ".U": "91121381\r", 
  ".W": "Cryosurgery, the in situ freezing of cancer, has been proposed in the past as a possible treatment for unresectable hepatic tumors. Its advantage lies in the fact that it is a very focal treatment sacrificing less normal tissue than surgical resection, allowing treatment of multiple lobes. Because cryosurgery does not affect large vessels, tumors in difficult locations, such as adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC), can be treated. With the use of intraoperative ultrasound to place the cryoprobes and monitor the freezing process, 18 patients with unresectable metastatic colon carcinoma confined to the liver were treated. Of the 18 patients treated, 4 (22%) are in complete remission as determined by computed tomography (CT) scans and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, with a mean follow-up of 28.8 months. Four patients (22%) were not adequately treated at the time of cryosurgery. The number of lesions frozen in each patient ranged from 1 to 12, with a mean of 6 lesions. Fourteen patients had bilobar disease; three patients had previous right lobectomies with recurrences in their remaining left lobes prior to cryosurgery, and one patient had unilobar disease. Mean survival of the 14 cases with recurrence was 21.4 months, with 2 of the 14 still alive. Ultrasound-guided hepatic cryosurgery appears to be an effective treatment for metastatic colon carcinoma to the liver that is unresectable (including patients with bilobar and multiple lesions). These preliminary results indicate that the procedure warrants further study.\r"

All had negative surgical resection margins and two received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The median follow-up was 29 months (4-43 months). The 3-year actuarial survival was 88%. The incidence of local failure was 7% (only site of failure) and 21% (component of failure). The incidence of local failure increased with T stage (T1, 0/3 [0%]; T2, 1/7 [14%]; and T3, 2/4 [50%]) and tumor size (greater than 3 cm, 33%, versus less than or equal to 3 cm, 0%). Three patients developed local failure at 6, 15, and 21 months. Three underwent a salvage abdominoperineal resection and were locally controlled at 2 and 28 months following salvage surgery. One patient underwent an abdominoperineal resection for a clinically presumed local failure; however, no tumor was found in the specimen. Therefore, the 13 patients who either were initially locally controlled or underwent salvage or nonsalvage surgery had no evidence of disease in the pelvis at the time of last follow-up. Local excision and postoperative RT may be an alternative to standard surgery in selected cases. However, additional follow-up and more experience are needed in order to determine if this approach will ultimately have local control and survival rates similar to those of a low anterior resection or an abdominoperineal resection.\r"

One hundred sixteen patients were randomized to receive neoadjuvant CT followed by definitive RT (treatment arm A) or alternating CT and RT. In treatment arm A, RT consisted of 70 Gy to the involved areas and 50 Gy to the uninvolved neck at 2 Gy/fraction, five fractions per week. In treatment arm B, RT consisted of 60 Gy to involved areas and 50 Gy to the uninvolved neck in three courses of 20 Gy each, 2 Gy/fraction, ten fractions/2 weeks alternated with four courses of CT. CT consisted of vinblastine 6 mg/m2 intravenously followed 6 hours later by bleomycin 30 IU intramuscularly, day 1; methotrexate 200 mg intravenously, day 2; leucovorin rescue, day 3. CT was repeated every 2 weeks up to four courses. The same CT was used in both treatment arms of the study. Fifty-five patients were entered in treatment arm A and 61 in treatment arm B. Complete responses were 7/48 and 19/57 in treatment arms A and B, respectively (P less than 0.03). Four-year progression-free survival was 4% in treatment arm A and 12% in treatment arm B (P less than 0.02), and four-year survival was 10% in A and 22% in B (P less than 0.02). Mucosal tolerance was significantly worse in treatment arm B (P less than 0.00004). The subgroup analysis shows the major improvement of alternating CT and RT in patients with the worst prognostic characteristics.\r"

Thirteen children had been resistant to first-line therapy, three had suffered a local relapse, and fourteen had suffered a disseminated relapse without over bone marrow infiltration. One child was treated initially because of resistance to first-line therapy, and subsequently for a local relapse. A total of 72 courses of 131-MIBG was administered, with doses ranging from 2.8 to 6.0 GBq (median, 3.7 GBq). One child received five courses, two four courses, 13 three courses, four two courses, and 12 one course of 131-MIBG. The most common toxic effect was thrombocytopenia, with a platelet level of less than 50,000/cmm occurring after 19 of 60 evaluable courses. A leukocyte count less than 1000/cmm was seen only once. There were six major responses (two complete) lasting 4 to 9 months, and two minor responses lasting longer than 38 and 44 months. Responses were seen more commonly in children whose only lesion was a residual primary tumor and in children who had not been pretreated who experienced disseminated relapse. Further studies of the role of 131-I meta-Iodobenzylguanidine in treatment of neuroblastoma are needed.\r"

The tumor was initially resected, but progression was seen at 1-month follow-up. Because further surgery to completely eradicate the tumor would have been extensive and disfiguring, 40-Gy external beam radiation was given in 20 fractions using a three-field wedge technique. Most recent clinical follow-up at 27 months showed local control. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for plasma cell granuloma when the disease can be completely resected. However, irradiation can also be effective in patients with recurrent or inoperable local disease.\r"

  ".W": "Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is a rare cutaneous malignancy, usually on the genitalia, that almost always extends beyond clinically apparent margins. Recurrences after standard methods of surgical excision are notoriously frequent; effective treatment with Mohs micrographic surgery was first reported in 1979. It has since been suggested this malignancy may be multifocal, and reports of recurrences after resection with micrographic surgery have appeared. The authors report six cases treated with Mohs surgery, two of which recurred. They also present data on 42 additional cases obtained from a written survey of members of the American College of Mohs Micrographic Surgery and comparison cases selected from the literature. The recurrence rate after micrographic surgery appears to be at least as low as that after conventional surgical excision with vertical frozen section or paraffin section margin control. Mohs micrographic surgery allows for maximal tissue sparing of critical anatomic structures and is performed under local anesthesia as an outpatient; because of this, it may be superior to conventional surgical excision. A scheme for management of this malignancy is presented. Surgeons should be aware radical excision is not needed for most cases of extramammary Paget's disease and very long-term patient follow-up is required.\r"

Overall, patients with DNA aneuploid tumors had a significantly worse prognosis than those with DNA diploid tumors (P less than 0.001) and, also in subdivided groups by tumor size (P less than 0.01). Among DNA aneuploid patients, the survival times were significantly shorter for patients with a low DNA index (less than 1.5) than for those with a high DNA index (greater than or equal to 1.5) (P less than 0.05). In a Cox multivariate analysis, nuclear DNA content provided significant prognostic value (P = 0.008), as did vascular invasion (P = 0.001) and intrahepatic metastasis (P = 0.005).

One hundred seven women recently diagnosed with breast cancer were followed for 26 weeks of treatment. Fifty-six (52%) of the patients experienced unjustified modification for at least one chemotherapeutic agent. Stepwise multiple regression revealed independent contributions of increased patient age, treatment setting (clinic versus academic or community private practice), and stage of disease to physician nonadherence. Regimen complexity, delay in seeking treatment, and presence of psychiatric disorder did not contribute, in general, to unjustified regimen modifications. Patient psychological and psychiatric factors, however, did influence prescribing behavior for vincristine. Physician awareness of factors contributing to unnecessary treatment modifications may reduce the frequency of such behaviors.\r"

The patient has remained reasonably well for at least 12 months after blastic crisis, and 6-mercaptopurine alone has been effective in controlling leukocytosis and megakaryoblast proliferation. The expression of mRNA for platelet-specific proteins, such as GPIIb and platelet factor 4 (PF4), was studied in the patient's blast cells by the Northern blot analysis. Both GPIIb and PF4 mRNA were detected in the blast cells. Cytoplasmic maturation occurs later than the synthesis of the surface GP during megakaryocyte maturation. Therefore, PF4 mRNA expression should be a marker of mature megakaryoblasts. The PF4 mRNA expression in megakaryoblastic leukemia may indicate that a patient will have long survival and a good response to chemotherapy.\r"

In five tumors there was only glial differentiation and in 20 tumors only neuronal differentiation. No reactivity for myelin and epithelial markers was found. Histologic and immunohistologic findings identified various degrees of differentiation in different tumors, which was bipolar (glial and neuronal) in most tumors and unipolar in the remainder.

Ten PC and four FC were also investigated for the presence of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). In situ deposits of immunocomplexes and circulating thyroid autoantibodies were also evaluated. An increased expression of Class I antigens was found in all PC and FC, in 33% of MC and AC, and in 31% of AD. An anomalous expression of Class II antigens was observed in 70% of PC, in 50% of FC, in 33% of AC, in 19% of AD, and in none of the MC. Expression of DP or DQ was revealed only in a portion of the DR-positive glands. A reduction of microsomal autoantigen expression was found. No ICAM-1-positive thyrocytes were detected. A moderate T-lymphocytic infiltrate was noticed only in PC, where it was correlated with DR and DP and/or DQ coexpression. B-cells and natural killer cells were virtually absent. The authors speculate that the weak Class II antigens expression, together with the partial or complete loss in microsomal autoantigen and the absence of ICAM-1 by thyrocytes, may account for the limited engagement of immunocompetent cells observed in thyroid tumors.\r"

These distribution patterns suggested that in a physiologic condition, PTHrP was closely related to keratinization and local secretion and/or the metabolism of calcium in specifically differentiated tissues. In lung cancer, however, PTHrP was detected in all cases of well-differentiated and moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and in most cases of small cell carcinoma, irrespective of the patients' serum calcium level. However, PTHrP was not detected in two of five cases of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and in all cases of adenocarcinoma. Consequently, it was found that PTHrP was commonly produced by squamous cell carcinomas of the differentiated type, and that humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy could be induced when the PTHrP transgressed the homeostatic mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, hematopoietic growth factors have been implicated in protean nonhematopoietic processes. In the current study, expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and its receptor (the c-fms proto-oncogene) was investigated in 42 samples of gynecologic tissues. There were 15 samples of normal ovarian and uterine tissue or benign conditions of these organs; 11 samples of primary ovarian cancer tissue; seven samples of metastatic ovarian cancer tissue; and nine samples of primary endometrial cancer tissue. Steady state transcript levels were assessed by Northern Blot analysis. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) expression was not observed in any of the specimens of benign abnormalities or of normal organs; c-fms expression was detected in two of 15 (13%) of these specimens, albeit at very low levels. In contrast, 14 (78%) of 18 ovarian tumor specimens, and five (55%) of nine endometrial tumor specimens expressed M-CSF. Similarly, 16 (89%) of 18 ovarian tumor specimens and six (67%) of nine endometrial tumor specimens expressed c-fms. Most positive malignant tissues (19 [86%] of 22) showed coexpression of M-CSF and c-fms. Of interest, M-CSF and c-fms mRNA were detected in tumor, but not in adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore, M-CSF and c-fms transcripts were produced by all metastatic tumors, including two cases in which the corresponding primary tumor from the same patient was negative. Because M-CSF mediates its effects by binding to its receptor, the increased levels of both these gene products in gynecologic malignancies suggest that an interaction between M-CSF and c-fms may participate in the development of ovarian and endometrial carcinomas and especially in progression to the metastatic state.\r"

Innovative advances in both morphologic and functional imaging have led to a dramatic improvement in our ability to diagnose and monitor human cancer. Frequently, anatomic detail can be demonstrated in ways that exceed views at surgery, and functional biochemical imaging is being used to show the metabolic activity and receptor status of normal and pathologic states. In vivo functional and biochemical studies differentiate normal from neoplastic or nonviable tissue, and make it possible to measure progression or regression of the disease. Because physiologic changes often precede morphologic findings in many disease processes, the use of in vivo biochemical probes can demonstrate disease before anatomic abnormalities become evident. Gross changes in anatomy are no longer adequate endpoints for therapy protocols. Today, using physiologic imaging, we can evaluate the response to treatment within hours of administration of therapy. Adjuvant metabolic tumor imaging studies provide complimentary information to morphologic evaluation of human cancers that will ultimately lead to better patient care.\r"

  ".U": "91121400\r", 
  ".W": "A study was conducted to compare results of transrectal ultrasound with pathologic findings on 116 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for treatment of prostate cancer. In 96% (111 of 116), transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies of a hypoechoic lesion proved cancer; seven patients had known Stage A cancer; one patient had cancer detected by palpation and not detected by ultrasound. Cancers in the outer gland (peripheral and central zones) were compared with cancers in the inner gland (transition zone) by both ultrasound and pathology. Forty-eight percent (52 of 108) of cancers originating in the outer gland showed extraprostatic extension (Stage C disease). The primary sites of tumor escape from the outer gland were the prostatic capsule (38%), anterior fibromuscular stroma (5%), seminal vesicle (18%), the base of the gland at the neurovascular bundle (21%), and the apex (31%). Twenty-two percent (17 of 54) of cancers originating in the inner gland (transition zone) showed extraprostatic extension (Stage C disease). The primary sites of tumor escape from the inner gland were the anterior fibromuscular stroma (6%) and apex (11%). Both histologic and biologic differences between outer and inner gland cancers were found when tumor size was controlled. Gleason scores were significantly different for inner and outer gland cancers, with mean scores of 6.2 +/- 1.6 and 7.4 +/- 0.9, respectively. An odds ratio of 8.6 confirmed the increased risk of extraprostatic extension for outer gland cancer. Outer gland cancers showed increased aggressive behavior of both histologic and biologic nature. The difference in biologic aggressiveness of outer and inner gland cancers has definite implications for treatment options. Use of other diagnostic parameters, such as DNA ploidy, may help to determine which cancers to treat and when to treat them; this may have more relevance for cancers originating in the inner gland. Strategic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy affords accurate tumor mapping and staging when modes of internal spread and escape of cancer from both outer and inner gland are known. Thus, transrectal ultrasound may be our \"window of observation\" through which additional research may explain the histologic and biologic discrepancies between outer and inner gland cancers.\r"

  ".W": "There is now a better understanding of the natural history of colorectal cancer, which has provided a basis for intervention to influence outcome. The possible interventions include earlier detection of colorectal cancer, removal of premalignant adenomas, demonstration of the mucosal field defect that precedes neoplasia to evaluate baseline risk and its change with dietary modification, and identification of inherited and dietary risk factors. Five controlled trials evaluating early detection of colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood testing have enrolled more than 309,000 patients. Early stage cancers with improved survival has been observed, but data on mortality reduction have not as yet been reported. Studies of patients with adenomas have demonstrated high synchronous and metachronous rates as a basis for complete colon evaluation initially and a surveillance follow-up program. Hyperproliferation and lack of normal differentiation have been observed as a field defect in the colon preceding neoplasia. Inherited factors have recently been shown to be important in a larger proportion of individuals destined to develop colorectal adenomas and cancer. These observations of the natural history of colorectal cancer have provided new opportunities for the application of radiologic and endoscopic techniques in diagnosis and surveillance; each examination has its merit. Further research is needed to answer many critical questions that have been raised regarding the impact of these interventions.\r"

It is a mistake to place colonoscopy and the barium enema in competitive positions; the two methods ideally complement one another in the evaluation of high risk individuals, including those with positive Hemoccult tests. The exclusion of significant pathology by the double-contrast enema can be relied on and is less costly to the patient. Detection of abnormalities by a barium enema should, when necessary, be followed by colonoscopic verification and/or biopsy. When used in this sequence, the procedures provide a cost-effective approach to the early detection and control of cancer; it is estimated that observance of the ACS guidelines can reduce mortality rates by 30%.\r"

The trials were conducted at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and the Mayo Clinic. Participants were middle-aged and older men who were chronic heavy cigarette smokers and thus at high risk of developing lung cancer. Screening procedures were chest radiography and sputum cytology, the only screening tests of established value for detecting early stage, asymptomatic lung cancer. In the Hopkins and Memorial trials the study population was offered yearly chest radiography plus sputum cytology every 4 months. The control population was offered yearly chest radiography only. In these trials the addition of sputum cytology appeared to confer no lung cancer mortality rate advantage. The Mayo Clinic trial compared offering chest radiography and sputum cytology every 4 months to offering advice that the two tests be obtained once a year. This trial demonstrated significantly increased lung cancer detection, resectability, and survivorship in the group offered screening every 4 months compared with the control group. However, there was no significant difference in lung cancer mortality rate between the two groups. The statistical power of these trials was somewhat limited. Nevertheless, results do not justify recommending large-scale radiologic or cytologic screening for early lung cancer at this time.\r"

The patient at high risk for thoracotomy is generally also subjected to radiologic staging.

The combined estimate of local extent and distant spread will assure adequate staging before definitive management decisions. Preoperative closed percutaneous biopsy for histologic diagnosis will be accomplished on an outpatient basis under fluoroscopic or CT guidance. Arteriography will be employed for delivery of local chemotherapy. Some combination of arteriography, MRI, and MR spectroscopy will be used to evaluate tumor response. After limb-salvage surgery, MRI will sequentially assess the tumor bed; bone scintigraphy and CT will detect skeletal and pulmonary metastases. The radiologist's role will undergo continuous redefinition.\r"

  ".W": "The number of imaging modalities available to stage and follow-up patients with primary neoplasms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract continues to increase. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography are useful techniques for both staging and follow-up. For staging, CT is most frequently used for the detection of liver metastases and is increasingly used as a substitute for the chest radiograph in the detection of lung metastases. CT is still the imaging test of choice for the preoperative staging of esophageal carcinoma. CT is less helpful in staging the patient with gastric carcinoma or colorectal carcinoma. The current usefulness of MRI in the staging of GI tract malignancies is limited by the lack of an adequate oral intraluminal contrast agent and degradation of images due to motion. Sonography, especially the new technique of endoscopic ultrasound, is promising for the detection of local invasion from GI tract malignancies. CT is used in the follow-up of patients with tumors of the GI tract to detect liver, adrenal, and nodal metastases as well as local recurrence because of the ability of CT to detect extraluminal masses. CT of the pelvis has been recommended as a routine follow-up procedure in patients who have undergone abdominal-peroneal resection. Both CT and MRI can be used to detect local recurrence, but suffer from the inability to differentiate scar from recurrent tumor. The initial hope that MRI would be capable of differentiating postoperative scar tissue from recurrent tumor has not been realized. Therefore, with positive CT or MRI findings, occasionally a percutaneous biopsy will be required to confirm local recurrence.\r"

These include ultrasound (US), radionuclide scintigraphy (RNS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and techniques especially designed for staging the extent of known liver cancer, such as computed tomography during arterial portography (CTAP) and intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS). Most authorities concede that CT scanning is the single test most closely fitting the designation \"gold standard\" for liver tumor imaging, although MRI, a less mature technique, is already preferred by some. Local factors profoundly influence the selection and sequence of imaging studies, including available equipment, radiologic skills, institutional interests, and especially the specific clinical circumstances of the patient. Thus, diagnostic algorithms or decision trees for sequential imaging workup of liver tumor suspects tend to be somewhat institution specific.\r"

  ".W": "Staging systems for breast cancer, unlike those of neoplasms in distant or recessed sites, allowed for the early development of clinical staging evaluation. It was established that clinical assessment of the breast lesion was often wrong compared with the pathologic examination (benign vs. malignant); clinical measurement of the tumor in centimeters was often larger than histologic size; and clinical assessment of axillary nodes (clear or metastatic) was incorrect in about 30% of cases. Although both clinical and pathologic staging provide effective discriminants for prognosis of treated patients, prognosis is more accurately determined by the pathologic stage. The single most important prognostic indicator is the axillary nodal status, and when positive, the number of positive nodes. The American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union International Contra Cancer have agreed on a TNM staging for breast carcinoma, and this is the preferable staging system. Follow-up of treated patients is of most value in detecting local recurrence on the chest wall (after mastectomy) or in the irradiated breast (after lumpectomy), and also in early detection of contralateral breast cancer. Physical examination and periodic mammography are most useful. There is a tendency to overinvestigate asymptomatic patients (with bone scans, blood tests, etc.), but this has been correctly criticized in recent years.\r"

For detection, definition (staging), and determination of resectability or recurrence, CT with intravenous contrast enhancement, and more recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium-DTPA, may be the only cross-sectional imaging studies required before institution of appropriate therapy. Carcinoma of the kidney is frequently diagnosed by serendipity or detected on incidental ultrasound or CT examinations. Real-time ultrasound and color flow Doppler offer unique information on tumor vascularity and major venous vascular involvement. Positive predictive values of 96% can be achieved for the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma using contrast-enhanced CT scanning. For follow-up CT and MRI are the best imaging techniques for evaluation of the retroperitoneum. MRI may distinguish tumor recurrence from fibrosis in selected cases. Because primary neoplasms of the adrenal gland are rare and often exceed 10 cm at the time of initial diagnosis, the functional nature (endocrine) of adrenal carcinoma may be part of the clinical presentation. Because initial stage is critical to survival and extent of surgical therapy, a knowledge of tumor classification is essential to the optimal diagnostic evaluation. Newer imaging tests, CT and MRI, have superseded conventional urography, ultrasound, and radionuclide studies for the diagnosis and staging of adrenal cancer. Early diagnosis and low stage at presentation are critical to survival in patients with adrenal carcinoma. The current concepts for pretreatment imaging evaluation and the role of CT, MRI, and ultrasound are outlined. An oncologic imaging approach based on tumor staging and classification for patients with real or suspected renal cell carcinoma and adrenal carcinoma is essential to optimal patient care.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-sectional imaging techniques i.e., computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), play an integral role in the evaluation of patients with carcinoma of the female reproductive system. Neither CT nor MRI, however, are tissue-specific, and benign and malignant disease cannot be differentiated using these techniques alone. Therefore, the diagnosis is clinical and is based on history, physical examination, and histology. After the diagnosis has been made, CT and MRI are recommended for noninvasive evaluation of tumor extent, often helping in designing optimal therapy, thus facilitating more effective treatment and ultimately influencing patient prognosis. In evaluating tumors of the uterus, including endometrial and cervical carcinomas, CT is limited to the evaluation of more extensive disease. It is believed that the value of CT rises proportionately to the size and extent of disease. Its major limitation is suboptimal tissue contrast resolution, making differentiation between a small tumor and the surrounding normal tissue difficult. MRI renders excellent soft tissue contrast, allowing direct tumor visualization and assessment of tumor volume, depth of penetration, and extension to adjacent tissues. Assessment of these parameters is crucial in deciding on the choice of therapy, whether surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or their combination. The initial management of ovarian cancer usually includes surgical staging with tumor debulking. CT remains the primary staging technique; its value resides primarily in identification of tumor metastases and in patient follow-up. Despite progress in the use of CT and MRI, second-look laparotomy for ovarian cancer has not been superseded. Technical advances in radiologic cross-sectional imaging have significantly improved the accuracy of noninvasive tumor staging. Although there are still limitations to these techniques, additional technical improvement and better tissue characterization are imminent.\r"

In the intradural extramedullary space, MRI is generally as accurate as myelography and postmyelography CT while being noninvasive. Finally, in the intramedullary space, MRI is unquestionably the procedure of choice in the evaluation of suspected cord tumors. In general, MRI has become the best initial procedure in the evaluation of suspected tumors of the spine, regardless of the space in which they may lie; frequently, it is the only required examination.\r"

Tumor Registry figures and epidemiologic data grossly understate the actual frequency of unknown primaries, because primary sites are often \"assigned\" to patients on a best-guess basis without positive proof of a tumor's origin. In the majority of patients whose primary tumors have continued to elude detection, the extensive use of diagnostic imaging studies fails to produce information that alters the patients' clinical course. Rare exceptions will be cited, but these exceptions prove the general rule. Imaging studies should therefore be targeted for selected patients with disseminated malignancies in whom identification of their primary tumors could benefit quality of life or length of survival.\r"

  ".W": "Targeting of radioactivity to tumors using antitumor antibodies is evolving from a laboratory curiosity toward a practical diagnostic and therapeutic technique that promises widespread benefits for many common human cancers. The development of the hybridoma technique by Kohler and Milstein for producing monoclonal antibodies is probably the single most important contribution to the development of this field. A large array of monoclonal antibodies against many human tumors have been created and labeled with a variety of radioisotopes; 110 clinical trials have been identified from the literature between the interval of 1978 to the present. These studies are beginning to form the basis for certain conclusions regarding likely benefits for certain combinations of antitumor antibodies and isotopes in specific instances of clinical management in patients with malignant neoplasms. For example, in melanoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and colorectal malignancies, radiolabeled antibodies have demonstrated occult tumors, which could not be disclosed with conventional methodologies. Radioimmunotherapy of malignant lymphoma is achieving durable remissions in patients who have failed conventional forms of therapy. For the most part, these advances have been achieved through intelligent application of known principles of immunochemistry, imaging physics, and tumor immunology. Progress has been slow but steady. In a few instances, the term \"magic bullet\" is warranted in describing the targeting of a particular radiolabeled antibody to a human tumor. I-131, 3-F8, an IgG3 against the GD2 antigen of neuroblastoma, which was introduced by Cheung, and In-111 T-101, against the CD5 antigen of T-cells, which was developed by Royston, stand out because of the consistency and high concentration of radioactive targeting to human tumors in clinical trials. If certain technical innovations fulfill their initial promise, the future will be bright for radioimmunologic methods of diagnosis and therapy. Genetic engineering will permit the development of \"humanized\" antibodies with biologic properties that favor tumor localization. New chemical approaches will broaden the range of isotopes available as diagnostic and therapeutic radiolabels. Application of modern imaging methodologies, such as positron emission tomography (PET), will detect more lesions of smaller size and permit quantitative imaging for dosimetry considerations. Greater speed and ease of use of computerized work stations will lead to the broader application of fusion imaging in which radioantibody images will be viewed simultaneously with TCT or MRI for better anatomic correlation of abnormal sites of antigen-reactive tumor deposits.\r"

  ".W": "Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are now being used to improve the information available from radioisotopic imaging of patients with cancer. These nuclear medicine techniques offer the potential for studying regional function and biochemistry by using radiolabeled substrates. The chemical changes of malignancy precede anatomic changes, and PET and/or SPECT may detect these changes before anatomic changes have occurred. The superiority of SPECT compared with planar imaging has been demonstrated for cardiac and brain imaging. Radiopharmaceuticals containing technetium 99 m (99mTc) are best suited for SPECT imaging because large amounts of radioactivity are administered and the collimator-camera systems are optimized for the 140 keV photons of 99mTc. The current interest in imaging cancer with SPECT relates to the use of gallium 67 citrate and monoclonal antibodies labeled with iodine 123 or indium 111. SPECT can image these radioisotopes, but the advantages compared with planar imaging have not been clearly defined. Furthermore, the ability to quantitate the distribution of single photon emitters other than 99mTc has not been demonstrated. New SPECT systems with three heads or rings of detectors offer promise for improved, quantitative imaging. PET has the capability of imaging tracers with the biologically important elements C-11, N-13, O-15, and F-18 used for positron labeling. These radioisotopes have short half-lives and require a cyclotron close to the PET facility. The most prominently used radiopharmaceutical for PET is F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). PET studies with FDG in patients with primary brain tumors have demonstrated the ability to determine the degree of malignancy, to differentiate necrosis from recurrent tumor after radiation therapy or chemotherapy, and to predict prognosis. Other metabolic functions of cancer have been studied, including amino acid accumulation, thymidine uptake, oxygen utilization, intermediary metabolism, and receptor status. PET has the potential to make a major impact on the characterization of a malignancy and the effect of therapy.\r"

SPECT quantifies the distribution of radiolabeled agents in tissues and organs; labeled monoclonal antibodies provide highly specific imaging of tumors. Spatial resolution is the limiting technologic factor. Proton MRI provides the highest current resolution, better than 1 mm in vivo in deep tissues, whereas the resolution of MRS and SPECT is limited to several cubic centimeters. Recent advances in these technologies have significantly increased their specificity and ability to detect small, deep lesions.\r"

The higher SPF among early OC users was apparent in patients with aneuploid tumors but not in patients with euploid tumors. Abortions (spontaneous or induced) before the first full-term pregnancy also were associated with a higher SPF compared with other young patients with breast cancer (P = 0.03). Adjusting for parity and abortions or OC use, respectively, an early OC use was associated with a 43% higher SPF and early abortions were associated with 49% higher SPF. Younger patients had a higher SPF and a higher frequency of aneuploid tumors, but this was found to be because the users of OC had a lower median age at diagnosis. Among never users, no significant age relationship was seen for SPF or the frequency of aneuploidy. For the DNA analyses there is a selection of patients with breast cancer with larger tumors, and therefore the conclusions drawn in this article may not be generalizable to patients with smaller primary tumors, e.g., cases diagnosed at breast cancer screening. The higher tumor proliferative activity and frequency of aneuploidy in early OC users are in line with previously reported findings of worse prognostic indicators and a worse survival in early users of OC compared with other young women with breast cancer.\r"

Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in the study and 12 of them had received prior conventional 5-FU chemotherapy. Treatment consisted of 4 weekly courses of high-dose LV (200 mg/m2) administered by intravenous (IV) bolus, followed by 5-FU (550 mg/m2) and CDDP (20 mg/m2) each administered as a 2-hour infusion on 4 consecutive days. After a median of 5.5 treatment cycles, objective tumor response was seen in 20 of 59 patients (34%) (this included 3 complete remissions). The response rate in the 47 previously untreated patients was 38% (95% confidence limits, 26% to 53%). Stable disease occurred in 16 (27%) patients, whereas the tumor progressed in 23 (39%) patients. The median survival time was 11.5 months, with 15% of the patients alive at 2 years. The regimen was well tolerated and the primary side effects were mild and reversible gastrointestinal symptoms and myelosuppression. There was no episode of life-threatening toxicity. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Grade III adverse reactions that required 25% dose reductions occurred in only 14% of the patients. The results of this trial suggest that 5-FU, LV, and CDDP is an active, safe, and well-tolerated combination regimen in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.\r"

Studies have shown that substantial differences exist between entry criteria and that these differences could influence the outcome of clinical trials. The factors contributing to these differences are not clear due to patient selection biases. Two hundred five unselected and consecutive patients allocated to and treated in good-risk and poor-risk treatment programs at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were reassigned risk status by the Indiana University (IU) Classification. The results were compared with those of the Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SECSG). The results using both criteria indicated substantial agreement in total end results and the identification of good-risk patients. The results in poor-risk patients differed substantially, with 39 patients (19%) classified as poor-risk by MSKCC criteria and 66 (32%) by Indiana criteria. The major discrepancy occurred in IU Stage 7, in which 26 of 32 patients (81%) achieved a complete response. The major factor contributing to this difference in risk assignment was the use of serum tumor markers. Serum tumor markers must be incorporated into risk assignment criteria for GCT clinical trials to minimize the number of good-risk GCT patients in poor-risk trials.\r"

Survival and/or response to salvage therapy were significantly enhanced for patients with a prior CR to induction chemotherapy, treatment with a cisplatin-based salvage regimen, a testis primary site, a normal serum human chorionic gonadotropin level, a normal serum lactate dehydrogenase level, one site of metastasis, and an Indiana Class of 6 or less.

When diagnostic doubts exist or stabilization is necessary, surgery precedes RT. Chemohormonal potentially responsive tumors are also treated with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Twelve patients (9.2%) underwent surgery plus RT, and 118 (90.8%) received RT alone. Thirteen (11%) early death patients were not evaluable. The 105 evaluable cases that received RT alone were analyzed. Median follow-up was 15 months (range, 4 to 38 months). Response among patients with back pain was 80%. In cases with motor dysfunction, 48.6% improved, and in 33 of 105 patients (31.4%) without motor disability there was no deterioration. Forty percent of patients with autonomic dysfunction responded to RT. Median survival time was 7 months with a 36% probability of survival for 1 year. The median duration of improvement was 8 months. The most important prognostic factor was early diagnosis. Radiosensitivity of tumor was only important in paraparetic patients in predicting response to RT. Complete myelographic block significantly diminished response to RT. Vertebral collapse did not influence response or survival.\r"

This institution admitted 903 PLC from January 1970 to April 1988, of which 118 cases were the central type; 65 cases were resected successfully, a resectability of 55.1%. One patient died from sepsis within 1 month of operation (mortality 1.53%). The modes of operation for the different segments are described, and suggestions for improvements are presented. The survival rates were compared with a similar number of patients with the peripheral type of tumor in the same period and treated by the same surgeons. The results show noticeable differences. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after resection were 70.9%, 43.2%, and 39.2% in the central type of PLC; they were 98.3%, 85.0%, and 76.4% in the peripheral type of PLC (P less than 0.001).

A previous study using the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) (Cavitron Lasersonic Corp., Stamford, CT) showed the successful removal of ovarian tumors from areas often considered unresectable: the diaphragm, spleen, stomach, and small bowel. However, the CUSA has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for gynecologic surgery except on an experimental basis. This study was designed to test whether ultrasonic irradiation produced by the CUSA caused alterations in cell structure or physiology of gynecologic tissue in adjacent areas. Paired tumor samples, unirradiated and irradiated, were obtained from ten patients, and portions were sent for pathologic structural evaluation and physiologic tissue culture evaluation. Histologic sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, showed that CUSA irradiation produced only minor tissue distortion as observed under the light microscope. A correct diagnosis would have been made in all cases had only tissue fragments obtained from the CUSA specimen trap been stained. For nine of ten patients, initial tumor cell viability was similar in the two specimen types. Flow cytometric DNA analysis confirmed that surgical methods produced matched samples. Cells that survived high-frequency ultrasound appeared functionally intact. For five of eight patients, the cells from the CUSA specimen traps survived and/or divided to a greater extent than those from the knife-dissected tumors. Cells from both surgical routes attained a similar number of passages in culture. It seems reasonable to extrapolate these in vitro observations with pelvic tumor tissues to normal surrounding tissue left in situ. Thus pelvic tissue is believed to be uninjured by CUSA ultrasonic irradiation.\r"

  ".W": "Using a monoclonal antibody specific to the Lewis X antigen (anti-Lex), the authors studied 103 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) in comparison with 57 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); three cases of granulocytic sarcoma (GS); two cases of malignant histiocytosis (MH); one case of monoblastic leukemia (ML); one case of interdigitating reticulum cell sarcoma (IRCS); six cases of histiocytosis X (HX); one case of reticulohistiocytoma (RH); 44 various reactive conditions of the lymph node (LN). Reed-Sternberg and related (R-S) cells stained selectively in 80 of 92 cases of HD (87.0%), excluding 11 cases of lymphocyte predominance type. The stain was better in B-5-fixed specimens than in formalin-fixed specimens, showing a dense deposit of reaction products at a paranuclear site and on the cell surface. The staining results were compared with those of Leu-M1 and found to be superior both qualitatively and quantitatively (detection rate of R-S cells: 87.0% versus 68.5% of Leu-M1). Granulocytes, rare epithelioid histiocytes, and some endothelial and/or erythrocytes also stained with anti-Lex. The stain had positive results in three cases of GS showing a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern. Of NHL, two of 29 peripheral T-cell lymphomas stained to show rare paranuclear deposits without cell surface staining. The stain had negative results in MH, ML, IRCS, HX, and RH. Of 45 reactive LN, minute subcapsular collections of Lewis X+, altered-appearing Langerhans'-like cells, were observed in all ten LN from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL). The stain had negative results in all other various reactive conditions of LN. In conclusion, Lewis X staining is useful as a marker for R-S cells in paraffin sections with staining results superior to those of Leu-M1. Lewis X staining also detects subcapsular clustering of altered-appearing Langerhans'-like cells in PGL, which has not been described previously and warrants additional study.\r"

  ".W": "The authors investigated the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF-R), estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and androgen (AR) receptors in 42 laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas and 20 normal laryngeal mucosa specimens. EGF-R were expressed in all tumor specimens analyzed, with significantly higher levels in tumor samples compared with normal mucosa (P less than 0.05). The immunohistochemical study demonstrated the presence of EGF-R in basal and parabasal cells of normal mucosa and in most of the cancer cells. There was no correlation between EGF-R and tumor localization or T classification. On the other hand, the authors did find an interesting correlation between EGF-R levels and grading, EGF-R levels being significantly higher in G3 than in G1-G2 tumors. Moreover, the three patients whose tumors expressed the highest EGF-R levels had disease recur within 8 months. Among tumor specimens, 9.5%, 35.7%, and 9.5% expressed very low but detectable ER, PR, and AR levels, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the levels of steroid receptors in the tumor and normal mucosa specimens, and neither was there any correlation of ER, PR, and AR with the pathologic findings. The authors' results suggest that the EGF-R system may play a role in regulating the growth of laryngeal cancer. Additional studies should demonstrate whether, as in other tumor types, EGF-R expression may have prognostic significance in human laryngeal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Two main models to account for the heterogeneous expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in human breast cancer have been proposed: the clonal model and the stem cell model. The authors previously provided evidence supporting the stem cell model since it was found that most of the proliferating cells in ER-positive (ER+) human breast cancer lack ER and that the ER-negative (ER-) and ER+ subpopulations are interrelated. The authors have analyzed in eighteen ER+/PR+ primary breast tumors the simultaneous expression of ER or PR (by immunohistochemistry) and DNA synthesis (by autoradiography) after 30 minutes of 3H-thymidine incorporation. The authors demonstrated that: (1) the average numbers of ER+ and PR+ cells were similar (36.8 +/- 10.7% and 39.3 +/- 17.6%, respectively); (2) The thymidine-labeling indexes of the ER+, ER-, PR+, and PR- subpopulations were 0.53 +/- 0.69%, 0.74 +/- 0.49%, 0.21 +/- 0.21 and 0.94 +/- 0.54%, respectively; and (3) 75.2% of the DNA-synthesizing cells were ER-, and 88.8% of them were PR-. The authors conclude that the cellular subpopulations expressing ER and PR were not identical, and the expression of PR was associated with a lower rate of cellular proliferation than was ER expression.\r"

  ".W": "Primary mammary lymphoma is rare, and little is known about the immunophenotype of such cases. The authors studied both primary and secondary breast lymphomas with a broad panel of T- and B-cell markers using paraffin-embedded tissue and the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. Cases of primary B-cell lymphoma were further tested to determine light and heavy chain type. Thirty-five cases were analyzed, including 16 primary lymphomas. Diffuse large cell lymphoma was present in ten of 16 primary and 14 of 18 secondary cases. Lymphoepithelial lesions in ducts and lobules and frequent vascular involvement were found in both primary and secondary cases. Immunohistochemistry studies on 13 tumors revealed all of the primary tumors to be B-cell in origin, except for one case of primary T-cell lymphoma; to the authors' knowledge, this represents the first description of this entity. Fifteen of 17 secondary tumors exhibited B-cell markers and one of 17 exhibited T-cell markers; in only one case could lineage not be determined. Among primary B-cell cases, IgM was found to be the most frequent heavy chain type; IgA reactivity was found in only one case. Survival was related to stage and histologic characteristics; patients with Stage II disease and higher grade histologic lesions had a worse prognosis. Half of the patients with primary lymphoma have had recurrent disease. Although local recurrences were observed, the authors also saw a tendency for recurrence in other extranodal sites. The authors conclude that, although primary lymphoma of the breast is compatible with long-term survival, a significant number of patients eventually die of their disease. As with other extranodal lymphomas, survival rate appears most related to stage of disease. Also, the vast majority of primary tumors are B-cell in origin, express IgM heavy chain, and can be considered tumors of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.\r"

From paraffin-embedded lymph node tissues of these patients, the authors examined DNA histogram pattern and DNA content, using flow cytometry, and histologic hyperplasia of germinal center and paracortical area; they also evaluated their correlation with the prognosis. In the good prognosis group at Stages I and II, paracortical hyperplasia (PH) of the lymph nodes was observed significantly more frequently. In the good prognosis group at Stage III, the incidence of PH, G2M phase in the DNA histograms, and DNA content were all significantly higher. DNA content was positively correlated with the grade of PH.\r"

  ".W": "To explore mechanisms of coagulation activation in adenocarcinoma of the prostate, the occurrence and distribution of components of coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways in situ were studied by means of immunohistochemical techniques applied to frozen sections of fresh malignant and benign hyperplastic prostatic tissue obtained at transurethral resection. Fibrinogen was distributed throughout the perivascular and tumor connective tissue in both malignant and benign disease but was not present in adjacent areas of normal prostate. Antibodies specific for fibrin and D-dimer crosslink sites stained vascular endothelium focally in both malignant and benign tissues. Both neoplastic cells and benign hyperplastic glandular epithelial cells stained weakly and in a patchy distribution for tissue factor and focally for low-molecular-weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Focal staining of vascular endothelium was also observed for tissue plasminogen activator and plasmin-antiplasmin complex neoantigen. By contrast, no tissue staining was observed for factor VII, factor X, factor XIII \"a\" subunit, high-molecular-weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 to 3, protein C, and protein S. Thus, the similarity in findings between benign hyperplastic and neoplastic prostate tissue, the lack of either an intact tumor cell-associated coagulation pathway or fibrin formation, and the presence of fibrin on vascular endothelium are consistent with the concept that coagulation activation in prostatic cancer may not be due to a direct effect of the tumor cells on the clotting mechanism. Rather, such activation may be induced by a soluble tumor product that activates procoagulant activity on certain host (for example, vascular endothelial) cells. These findings, together with the lack of effect of warfarin anticoagulation on the clinical course of patients with prostatic cancer, contrast with findings in certain other tumor types and suggest that coagulation activation may not contribute to progression of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.\r"

Association of the expression between N-myc and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes in 33 neuroblastomas obtained from Japanese children was investigated. Amplification of the N-myc gene was observed in two of five cases in Stage III, six of 11 cases in Stage IV, and one of five cases in Stage IV-S. In each case, the expression of N-myc gene was significantly increased. The expression was also increased in cases without amplification of the N-myc gene, the origin being from the suprarenal region. Expression of the MHC class I gene was significantly decreased in five of these nine with a high level of N-myc expression with amplification. These results suggest that the down-modulation of the MHC class I expression may be associated with the high level of expression and amplification of N-myc gene in the advanced stage of neuroblastoma.\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred seventeen patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (54 low grade, 180 intermediate grade, 76 high grade, and seven unclassified) treated with chemotherapy were evaluated for the presence of hematologic abnormalities at diagnostic staging. Anemia was present in 42%, leukopenia in 6%, thrombocytopenia in 13%, leukocytosis in 26%, and thrombocytosis in 14% at presentation. The presence of bone marrow involvement by lymphoma was more likely to be associated with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia than the absence of bone marrow involvement. Although anemia was slightly more common in patients with bone marrow lymphoma than in those without marrow lymphoma, the difference was not statistically significant. Hematologic parameters were similar for patients with B-cell or T-cell lymphoma. Evidence of bone marrow failure with multiple cytopenias was present in 26 patients (8%). Leukoerythroblastosis was present in 2%. Circulating lymphoma was present in 9.5%. Anemic patients had a shorter survival time than nonanemic patients, whether bone marrow was involved by lymphoma or not. Survival was not affected by the presence of leukopenia or mild leukocytosis, but, in patients without marrow lymphoma, leukocytosis with a leukocyte count greater than 20 x 10(9)/l was associated with short survival length. Thrombocytopenia was associated with short survival time only in patients with bone marrow involvement by lymphoma. Patients with multiple cytopenias or leukoerythroblastosis had short survival times, but the presence of circulating lymphoma did not alter survival when compared with other patients with bone marrow involvement by lymphoma. These data suggest that hematologic evaluation at the time of diagnostic staging of NHL provides useful prognostic information that may have therapeutic implications.\r"

Two patients with mammary cancer (primary tumors or metastases), analyzed for the levels of amplification of the oncogene erb-B2, are described in detail. This technique is suitable for analyzing alterations occurring during cancer progression and for identifying subgroups of mammary cancer with different characteristics.\r"

The relationship among histopathologic features, DNA distribution pattern, and survival time was investigated from the standpoint of recurrence. Of 128 patients, 77 (60.1%) died of recurrence within 2 years after surgery: 16 (12.5%) from 2 to 5 years and two (1.6%) over 5 years. The rate of death of recurrence within 2 years was higher in patients with T4 or N1 than T1, T2, and T3 or N0 (P less than 0.01). Survivors over 5 years more frequently possessed type II DNA pattern than types III and IV (P less than 0.05). The rate of death of recurrence within 2 years was 34.4% in type II, which was lower than the 59.6% rate in type III (P less than 0.05) and the 76.6% rate in type IV (P less than 0.01). Survivors from 2 to 5 years were higher in type III than in type IV (P less than 0.05), and recurrence over 5 years was found only in type II. This inclination was more apparent in those with curative resection. In the patients with type II, careful follow-up may be needed over 5 years for late recurrence. However, in those with type IV, no recurrence over 2 years could be regarded as healed because most of their recurrences occur within 2 years. These findings suggest that the growth rate of esophageal carcinoma should reflect DNA aneuploidy, and the DNA analysis of esophageal carcinoma should be a valuable parameter for postoperative follow-up planning.\r"

When this report was written, 7 years had passed since he underwent operation, and no recurrence of the meningioma had been detected. In Patient 2, a 61-year-old woman, multiple pulmonary metastases were confirmed 19 years after she had undergone operation for multiple cerebellar meningiomas, and the metastases were resected. After 2 years, multiple intraperitoneal metastases were found, and thus aggressive surgery was performed. Currently, 22 years after the operation for the primary cerebellar meningioma, the patient is alive without any subjective symptoms, although intraperitoneal metastases have recurred. To date, only four cases (all in women) of primary pulmonary meningioma have been reported. Case 1 reported in this article is thus the first case in a male patient to be reported, and, in addition, this patient also has the first reported case to have been evaluated for more than 5 years. In Case 2, however, each of the excised extracranial tumor lesions was histologically homogeneous and showed a hemangiopericytomatous pattern. The histologic picture of those tumor lesions was exactly the same as the picture of a small portion of the cerebellar meningiomas excised 19 years earlier. Thus, all those extracranial tumor lesions were diagnosed to be metastatic meningiomas. However, it is difficult to explain why there had been no symptoms for as long as 19 years until the pulmonary metastases were discovered.\r"

In 20 patients, cancer foci were in the prostatic region accessible to transurethral resection (TUR). Eight of these 20 patients had stage A1 disease (less than or equal to 3 foci); in six of these patients all foci were located at or within the transition-zone boundary only. Twelve patients had stage A2 disease (greater than 3 foci); in none were more than three foci at or within the transition-zone boundary. Among the 20 patients, 84 tumor foci were distributed as follows: 62% in the peripheral zone, 10% in the transition zone, 3% in the central zone, and 25% in the transition zone boundary. The authors' data suggest that Stage A prostate cancer, like larger clinically detectable cancers, is multifocal, multizonal, and similarly distributed with respect to the urethra. No case of Stage A1 disease would have been reclassified as Stage A2 by repeat TUR of the entire transition zone and transition zone boundary. The authors' results confirm those of previous studies that report a high incidence of residual carcinoma in regions not accessible to TUR in patients with presumptive Stage A1 disease and suggest that ultrasonography and ultrasonographically guided biopsies, rather than repeat TUR, may more accurately define the extent of Stage A disease in some patients.\r"
