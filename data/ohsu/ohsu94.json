  ".W": "In order to more fully understand the mechanisms involved in the developmental defect in polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) movement in human neonates, the authors have examined several events in the activation response sequence. Chemotactic factor receptor numbers have been found to be normal on the PMNs of neonates, but chemotactic factor-induced changes in membrane potential and cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations were markedly decreased to absent in the neonatal cells. Because the neonatal PMN lacks the ability to deform normally, we examined the effects of a methylxanthine derivative, pentoxifylline, on the responses of neonatal cells. This agent has been reported to increase cell deformability and improve cell movement. Pentoxifylline had an effect in improving chemotactic function in the PMNs of neonates, while correcting the abnormality in membrane potential. In addition, this agent was found to enhance the movement of cell surface concanavalin A receptors after colchicine treatment. These results suggest that this developmental defect in cell activation and movement may be an abnormality that can be corrected pharmacologically.\r"

  ".W": "Nuclear DNA contents of 95 paraffin-embedded parathyroid glands (2 carcinomas, 56 adenomas, 10 primary and 17 secondary chief cell hyperplasias, and 10 normal glands) were determined by flow cytometric analysis. All normal parathyroid glands and secondary hyperplasias, 80% of the primary hyperplasias, and 73% of the adenomas had diploid DNA patterns, with 15% or less tetraploid cells. Twenty-one percent of the adenomas, 29% of the primary hyperplasias, and all carcinomas had diploid and tetraploid DNA distribution patterns, with greater than 15% of the cells in the tetraploid region. One of the carcinomas (Figure 4B, Case 2) had an additional near-triploid aneuploid peak. Three of the adenomas (5.4%) had near-triploid aneuploid patterns. One of the patients with carcinoma (Figure 4A, Case 1) died, 32 months after initial diagnosis, of disease-related causes. The remaining patient with carcinoma (Case 2) had a 47-month disease-free interval. All of the patients with hyperplastic and adenomatous glands are free of disease, after a mean follow-up interval of 25 months. This study indicated that flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content does not complement conventional pathologic methods in distinguishing between parathyroid gland chief cell hyperplasia, adenoma, or carcinoma; however, it did suggest the possibility that parathyroid adenomas and primary chief cell hyperplasias may contain a subset of tumors that could manifest biologic malignancy if allowed to progress untreated.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested a possible role for natural killer (NK) cells in resistance to some fungal infections, including Cryptococcus neoformans infections. The role of NK cells in early clearance of C neoformans from tissues and in long-term survival was studied in mice following intravenous inoculations of the organism. Mice treated with anti-asialo GM1 antiserum to temporarily reduce NK activity demonstrated an increase in colony-forming units (CFU) of C neoformans in the lung 24 hours after an intravenous inoculation of the organism. CFU in liver, spleen, kidney, and brain were not different in anti-asialo GM1 antiserum-treated versus control mice. An NK-specific reagent, anti-NK 1.1 monoclonal antibody, was used to deplete mice of NK cells in vivo for at least 14 days without affecting other natural defenses. The number of C neoformans retained in the lungs 24 hours after inoculation of the organism was significantly greater in NK cell-depleted mice than in controls, although CFU in other organs were unaffected. Following the intravenous inoculation of C neoformans, the survival of anti-NK 1.1-treated mice was not different from control mice. The effect of NK cell activity on resistance to C neoformans was also determined after an intratracheal inoculation of the organism. Mice pretreated with anti-NK 1.1 demonstrated no increases in CFU in the lungs, spleen, or brain as compared with controls. These data indicate that NK cells can play a role in vivo in early resistance against C neoformans if the organism is delivered via the intravenous route. However, NK cells do not play a role in either determining survival after an intravenous inoculation nor in resistance during an infection acquired via the respiratory tract.\r"

Recent discharge from hospital was associated with the highest relative probability of program discontinuance (2.7, 95% CI = 2.2, 3.4), followed by having cancer (2.1, 95% CI = 1.6, 2.8), and having a non-hip fracture (2.0, 95% CI = 1.3, 2.9). Many of those with cancer died, while those recently discharged and those with non-hip fractures were more likely to leave the program because they were again able to cook for themselves.\r"

Of 162 staff members tested, 21 (13.0 per cent) were HBV marker positive and two (1.2 per cent) had HBsAg; specialized educators and teachers showed the highest HBV marker prevalence (22.2 per cent and 21.3 per cent, respectively). The prevalence of HBV markers among staff was independently associated with classroom contact with a HBsAg-positive student, duration of employment at the school, and previous work with mentally retarded individuals. The incidence of HBV infection among teaching staff with regular classroom contact, estimated by logistic regression analysis, was 2.6 per cent per year. This observation indicates that teaching staff in schools for mentally retarded students with direct classroom contact may carry an occupational risk of HBV infection.\r"

Sixteen sudden and unexpected deaths associated with sleep were found that were similar to the sudden deaths noted among Southeast Asian refugees in the United States. A case-control study in Ban Vinai revealed associations between sudden death in sleep and membership in the Green-Hmong subgroup, a family history of sudden death, and previous non-fatal sleep disturbances. Sudden and unexpected death during sleep of young adults is a regional phenomenon within Asia and occurs in populations that are culturally and genetically distinct. Migrants from affected populations in Asia carry with them the susceptibility to sudden death in sleep.\r"

Liquid-crystal thermometers for testing hot water temperature were offered at no cost; 140,000 were requested. Pre- and post-program general population random surveys (N = 337 and 318, respectively) found increased awareness of the danger of hot tap water, from 72 per cent to 89 per cent, but no increase in testing or lowering of water heater temperatures. A third random sample survey (N = 325) among thermometer requesters found a higher rate of testing (difference 58.1 per cent, 95 per cent CL 55.3 per cent, 60.9 per cent) than in the general population. Of those who tested, 43 per cent reported temperatures in the dangerous range of 54.4 degrees C (130 degrees F) or greater; 52 per cent of this group lowered their water heater thermostat. These findings indicate that: more than 25 per cent of the public is unaware of the potential danger of hot tap water; a safety education program which increases awareness will not necessarily result in injury-control behavior; and most people motivated to request a free thermometer will test their hot water temperature and lower it if necessary. As a result of this effort, thermostats of an estimated 20,000 water heaters were lowered from dangerously high levels.\r"

Less than half reported screening potential residents for communicable diseases before admitting them, and the majority reported that most of their staff are trained in basics of first aid, principles of hygiene, and experienced in day care work. More than half of the staff in the majority of shelters are counselors, but only 5 per cent (4/73) of shelters have health care workers. Less than one-fourth of the shelters have areas designated for diapering infants and less than half of the shelter directors knew of specified health regulations applying to their shelter. For most shelters, limitations on staff size, training, and funding may restrict the types of disease control measures they can apply. However, basic hygienic practices, such as strict handwashing and identification and cohorting of sick clients, may be effective in disease prevention.\r"

When causes of death were classified into fetal, placental/cord, maternal/environmental, and unknown, comparison of reported underlying cause of death revealed marked inaccuracies on FDF. Placental/cord causes reported on FDF often could not be documented subsequently while, in contrast, fetal causes of death were underreported. Few accurate fetal diagnoses were present on FDF.

  ".W": "An anatomical study of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint and its supporting ligaments was performed using both macroscopic and microscopic methods. The project used 63 cadaver shoulders of unknown ages. Fifty-three joints were used for macroscopic and 10 for microscopic study. The data consisted of micrometer measurements of the dimensions of the extrinsic and intrinsic ligaments of the AC joint; measurement and description of the intraarticular meniscus and the superior and inferior capsular ligaments of the AC joint; and the anatomical course and relationship of the coracoacromial (CA) ligament to the supporting ligaments of the AC joint and a description of its insertion on the acromion process. The following observations were made: The coracoclavicular ligament, especially the trapezoid ligament, provides significant soft tissue restraints to upward displacement of the clavicle. A complete AC joint disc was found in only one, meniscoid discs in 25, remnants of discs in 16, and no discs in 11 of the 53 joints studied macroscopically. (No age correlation was made since the ages of the cadavers were unknown). The CA ligament interconnects with the inferior capsular ligament of the AC joint as well as with the coracoclavicular and coracohumeral ligaments. It also has a broad area of insertion on the inferior acromial surface. The CA ligament appears to function as a buffer between the acromion and the rotator cuff, and to provide support for the AC joint. Transection of the CA ligament may result in loss of this buffering function.\r"

The EMG from the quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups was recorded and analyzed in three separate experimental procedures in which the knee was stressed. The test revealed that direct stress of the ACL has a moderate inhibitory effect on the quadriceps, but simultaneously it directly excites the hamstrings. Similar responses were also obtained in patients with ACL damage during loaded knee extension with tibia subluxation, indicating that an alternative reflex arc unrelated to ACL receptors was available to maintain joint integrity. The antagonist muscles (hamstrings) were clearly demonstrated to assume the role of joint stabilizers in the patient who has a deficient ACL. The importance of an appropriate muscle-conditioning rehabilitation program in such a patient is substantiated.\r"

  ".W": "Although the intercondylar notch becomes narrowed with a failed repair of the ACL or with chronic instability of the knee, narrowed intercondylar notches have frequently been observed during arthrotomy for an acute ACL tear in previously uninjured knees. In order to determine whether the structure of the intercondylar notch predisposes a knee to anterior cruciate tears, a computer graphics study was designed. Notch view roentgenograms of 50 patients with an acute ACL injury and 50 \"normal\" patients without history of significant knee injury were compared. An interactive graphics design station was used to obtain the area of the anterior opening (ANT) and posterior arch (POST) of the intercondylar notch. A \"total\" (TOTAL) area was obtained by tracing the distal 7.5 cm of the femur. Only the ratios of areas obtained from each roentgenogram were used for comparison because of varying femur sizes among patients and possible slightly varying techniques of taking the notch view roentgenogram itself. The following ratios were developed: ANT/POST, POST/TOTAL, and (POST-ANT)/TOTAL. The difference between the means of the ratio POST/TOTAL for knees with acute ACL tears and those for normal knees was statistically significant (P less than 0.005). This study suggests that a narrowed posterior arch of the intercondylar notch may predispose a knee to ACL tear.\r"

The type of injury was closely distributed among sprains, fractures, contusions, and strains. Collisions, with other players and objects, resulted in 64% of these injuries. Offensive ball handlers (running backs and receivers) had the greatest probability of being injured. From this data, it is obvious that women's injury patterns are not the same as men's and that varsity injury data cannot be extrapolated to recreational injuries.\r"

Circulatory skin changes are in turn reflected by altered superficial thermal emission, which can be reliably imaged by thermography. Examples of classic thermographic patterns associated with commonly occurring injuries and detected along cutaneous distributions of peripheral nerves or spinal root dermatomes are presented. Thermographic abnormalities may also occur in ondermatomal distributions to involve an entire hand, foot, or extremity as observed in reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Such thermographic findings often appear before skin or roentgenographic changes become manifest and lead to earlier diagnosis. Prompt and more effective treatment, particularly in reflex sympathetic dystrophy, may thereby be initiated so that full blown, difficult to manage, chronic disability may be averted. The diagnosis of malingering may also be strengthened or suspected if thermographic studies together with other examinations are normal.\r"

He used this term to describe a mass of hyalinized tissue that formed following an inversion sprain of the ankle. This band of tissue was predisposed to trapping between the fibula and the talus. His patients presented with persistent pain and swelling over the anterior aspect of the ankle. In the last 3 years, four patients have presented with this lesion at the Methodist Sports Medicine Center in Indianapolis. They were all soccer players who had experienced repeated ankle sprains accompanied by persistent pain, swelling and trapping. Initially, these patients were treated with physical therapy, taping, and antiinflammatory medication. After 6 months of treatment, they continued to have symptoms and underwent arthroscopic examination. In each case a band of white, fibrous tissue was found during surgery and was removed. After an appropriate period of rehabilitation, all four patients returned to competition with a cessation of symptoms. However, one patient reported recurrent pain on rare occasions.\r"

  ".W": "Elbow injuries are common in baseball pitchers. Curve balls are thought to increase this risk, particularly if the athlete begins throwing this pitch at an early age. The purpose of this paper is to identify forearm muscle firing patterns during the pitching cycle in an effort to understand this etiology. Dynamic EMG was performed on eight collegiate pitchers to evaluate extensor digitorum communis, brachioradialis, flexor carpi radialis, flexor digitorum superficialis, extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis, pronator teres, and supinator. Each subject threw a fast ball and curve ball, which were filmed at 450 frames per second and synchronized with the EMG. These signals were converted from analog to digital records. Results showed low to moderate activity in all muscles during all phases of the pitch. The function is probably positioning to accept the transfer of energy from the larger trunk and girdle structures. The most notable difference between the fast ball and curve ball is a slight increase in the extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis activity during late cocking, acceleration, and follow-through of the curve ball as compared to the fast ball. This difference, however, is not significant. In addition, there was no significant difference between the fast ball and the curve ball in the flexor-pronator group in any phase. We cannot substantiate that medial elbow problems are a result of an increase in the use of flexor muscles during the curve ball pitch.\r"

In one case, the neurovascular bundles of the middle finger were entrapped by the proximal edges of Cleland's ligaments. In the other two cases, the blood vessels to the index and middle fingers were compressed within the lumbrical canal. Hypertrophy of the lumbrical muscles and/or thickening of the palmar aponeurosis were responsible for the compression of the vessels. Surgical release of Cleland's ligaments or palmar aponeurosis, including superficial transverse fiber and vertical septa, resulted in good recovery of the circulation of the involved fingers. All of the pitchers returned to professional or college league baseball without recurrence of the ulcer.\r"

Minimally to moderately obese, otherwise healthy young women seeking to lose weight through a program of exercise without dietary restrictions were randomly assigned to one of three groups in which only the type of daily exercise was different. The three types of exercise were brisk walking, riding a stationary cycle, and swimming laps in a pool. All women slowly but progressively increased the time spent in daily exercise to 60 minutes. After 6 months or slightly longer, the women assigned to walking lost 10% of initial weight, the women who cycled lost 12%, but the women who swam lost no weight. The thickness of the subcutaneous panniculus over the middle of the extensor surface of the upper arm was measured using a Lang skin-fold caliper (Graham Field Co, New York, NY) and showed equivalent substantial reductions in the walkers and cyclists, but no change in the swimmers. The results of this study show that both walking and cycling are effective methods of reducing body fat, but that swimming is not.\r"

The diagnosis may be suspected when symptoms begin and progress months after an injury, when symptoms occur with vigorous activity, and when symptoms are most pronounced during midstance and preswing phases of the gait cycle. Confirmation of the diagnosis is easily made through radiographic examination, which should include the entire leg. Bone scan may show increased tracer uptake. Interference with normal dynamic function of the fibula subjects the synostosis to repetitive stress and ultimate fatigue fracture with resultant pain. Conservative treatment is recommended initially. Surgical excision should be reserved for the athletically active patient whose symptoms are gradually progressing and disabling, and whose synostosis has taken on the appearance of mature cortical bone on radiographs. The principles of tumor biopsy should be adhered to, lest the diagnosis be in error. Finally, meticulous hemostasis and use of bone wax may lessen the possibility of recurrence.\r"

The loss of righting reflex for 15 seconds was used to estimate the anaesthetic effect. The mean anaesthetic dose (AD50) for the pregnanolone emulsion was 5.25 mg/kg and for Althesin, 2.8 mg/kg. The mean lethal dose (LD50) was 44 mg/kg for pregnanolone and 54 mg/kg for Althesin. The sleeping time after pregnanolone was 2.5-3.5 times longer than after Althesin in dosages above 7.5 mg/kg. No signs of pain or local reaction from injection were observed for either of the drugs. The onset of action was fast for both drugs, with only minor signs of excitation, and recovery was rapid and without excitation. The results indicate that the anaesthetic properties of pregnanolone emulsion are very similar to those of Althesin. Further studies will show whether it can fill the major vacuum left in anaesthetic practice after the withdrawal of Althesin.\r"

Retention of the stimuli was tested using a cued recall technique, and the performance of the two experimental groups was compared with a control group which had not been exposed to the material but was tested in the same way. The light anaesthesia group retained more items than did the other two groups but this difference was significant (p less than 0.05) only when compared with the other experimental group. This is not very strong evidence of auditory registration, but a greater effect might be found with exposure to emotionally significant material. It is suggested that patients should be protected from unfortunate theatre conversation.\r"

The two patients with reduced clearance suffered from septic shock and were studied over a longer period. Their altered clearance was due to a reduced capability to form the 1-OH metabolite. As their condition improved, plasma concentrations of 1-OH midazolam increased and midazolam clearance returned towards normal. The impaired ability of critically ill patients with septic shock to metabolise midazolam, may be due to reduced organ perfusion and may lead to cumulation of midazolam in these patients.\r"

In the ilio-inguinal block group, 100% had either no pain or very mild discomfort when assessed 60 minutes after return to the day unit, compared to 95% in the infiltration group. Some children did appear to have pain following discharge but in all cases this responded well to simple analgesics. We conclude that both techniques provide satisfactory analgesia whilst the complications of narcotics are avoided, and suggest that simple infiltration of the wound with local anaesthetic solution should be encouraged in paediatric anaesthesia.\r"

The mean level of sensory analgesia (pinprick) was T8,9 +/- 1.0 (+/- SEM) and the mean degree of motor blockade was 1.3 +/- 0.1 (Bromage scale). Intrathecal bupivacaine significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased the amplitude of all SEP components after stimulation of the L1 dermatome and most components during stimulation of the S1 dermatome. Intrathecal bupivacaine also increased the latency of SEPs (P less than 0.05) of both dermatomes. The L1 SEP disappeared in 7 and the S1 SEPs in 5 of the 12 patients during neural blockade. In three patients the SEPs disappeared at both locations. Sensory thresholds increased significantly during blockade. We found no correlation between decrease of amplitude and degree of motor blockade or level of sensory analgesia. Thus, intrathecal plain bupivacaine has a strong depressant effect on the neural afferent transmission as assessed by SEPs. However, despite clinically effective blockade as assessed by pinprick and motor blockade nerve potentials after nociceptive stimulation within the area of sensory block were often able to pass to the cerebral cortex.\r"

To examine the influence of abdominal surgery on abdominal muscle tone, electromyographic (EMG) activity of abdominal and lower intercostal muscle was compared before operation with that at 3 hr and at 24 hr after operation in 18 healthy patients undergoing elective gastric or biliary surgery. After operation, EMG activity increased markedly and showed a phasic pattern of activity associated with respiration in most patients. This was characterized by a progressive increase in EMG activity during expiration with an abrupt decrease at the onset of inspiration. We conclude that increased expiratory activity in abdominal and lower intercostal muscle may be responsible for the decrease in lung volumes that occurs after upper abdominal surgery.\r"

None had preoperative alterations in coagulation or liver function and none were receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication. Whole blood coagulation status was quantitated using thrombelastography (TEG). Blood samples for TEG were obtained 5 min before and 15 min after induction of anesthesia, after each increment of blood loss (EBL) equalling 5% of estimated blood volume (EBV), at the end of surgery, and 2 hr post-operatively. Patients with EBL exceeding 0.15 EBV were given packed red cells and crystalloid solution. Patients with EBL less than 0.15 EBV received only crystalloid. Thrombelastography analysis showed a trend toward increased coagulability with progressive blood loss. Two of four patients with 80% loss of EBV maintained normal to enhanced coagulation status, although the other two developed clinical and thrombelastographic evidence of coagulopathy. Thrombelastography allowed rapid intraoperative diagnosis and specific treatment of loss of platelet activity in the latter two patients. We conclude that during moderate to massive blood loss, use of supplemental fresh frozen plasma and/or platelets should be reserved for patients with documented defects in coagulation. Thrombelastography is useful for the detection and management of coagulation defects associated with intraoperative blood loss.\r"

Prior to hepatic resection the effects of a short period of PTC (3-5 min) were evaluated in all 48 patients: mean arterial pressure increased 21%, whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac index decreased 10 and 17%, respectively. Systemic vascular resistance increased 48%. In 34 patients a liver resection was performed during PTC and hemodynamic measurements were repeated throughout the duration of liver ischemia, which ranged from 14 to 68 min. Hemodynamic changes occurred in the first 3 min and persisted thereafter. After releasing the clamp, hemodynamic parameters returned to initial values in 3 min. These results confirm that PTC does not induce the cardiovascular collapse in humans that it does in common laboratory animals and demonstrate that humans tolerate PTC for periods up to 1 hr.\r"

We analyzed the incidence of complications and the quality of pain relief obtained during the use of NCPB in 136 patients with pancreatic cancer. Eighty-five percent of the patients had good pain relief that, in 75% of cases, lasted through the patients' remaining life. No permanent neurologic complications resulted, although two patients had a pneumothorax. Radiographically guided needle placement did not affect quality of pain relief or the incidence of complications. This neurolytic pain block is effective, has a low incidence of neurologic complications, and deserves more widespread use in patients with pancreatic cancer.\r"

Anterior fontanel pressure was monitored and recorded continuously with a Ladd AFP monitor. Systolic and mean blood pressures were recorded at 1-min intervals. In group 1 (n = 6) patients, 0.02 mg/kg intravenous atropine was administered and awake intubation was performed. Group 2 (n = 6) patients received 0.02 mg/kg intravenous atropine and 0.1 mg/kg pancuronium and one of four anesthetics--0.75% isoflurane, 0.5% halothane, 20 micrograms/kg fentanyl, or 2 mg/kg ketamine--with intubation after 10 min of mask ventilation. In group 1, AFP increased from 7.7 cm H2O to 23.8 cm H2O (P less than 0.05); the mean increase in AFP was 197%. Anterior fontanel pressure did not change significantly in group 2. Significant increases in AFP may increase the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm neonates. The present data indicate that indirectly measured ICP increases significantly during awake tracheal intubation in preterm neonates and that this increase can be prevented by prior administration of pancuronium and a general anesthetic.\r"

The slopes of the carbon dioxide ventilatory response curves [delta VE/delta PCO2(L.min-1 X %CO2(-1)] were 7.45 +/- 1.17 with nalbuphine and 2.42 +/- 0.56 with butorphanol.

The subjects were randomly allocated into six groups. All patients received 15 mg bupivacaine plain solution in 4 ml, in the horizontal position. Patients in group 1 received bupivacaine plus 1 ml normal saline; patients in other groups received bupivacaine plus increasing dosages of epinephrine: 0.1 mg (group 2), 0.2 mg (group 3), 0.3 mg (group 4), 0.4 mg (group 5), 0.5 mg (group 6). The segmental level of sensory loss was tested using forceps. The time required for maximal spread of the sensory blockade was significantly 50% greater in group 5 than in group 1. No difference was observed, however, between mean highest levels. Addition of 0.2 mg epinephrine prolonged by a significant 25% regression time to L-2 level. Addition of 0.3 and 0.4 mg epinephrine significantly prolonged two-segment regression time by 36 and 53%, respectively, and regression to L-2 level by 29 and 44%, respectively. Addition of 0.5 mg epinephrine did not result in further prolongation of anesthesia. Motor blockade was also increased by addition of epinephrine. It is concluded that addition of 0.3 mg epinephrine may be useful to increase duration of isobaric bupivacaine spinal anesthesia.\r"

Ischemic rest pain and ulcers were treated with intravenous infusions of PGE1 at dose rates of 14-21 ng kg-1 min-1 for seventy hours, once a week. Symptomatic relief of rest pain and spontaneous healing of stable ulcers occurred. Whereas classically dependable noninvasive circulation evaluations were not prognostic of the treatment's success, they did suggest local and rheological changes rather than a generalized vasodilation. The PGE1 infusion is efficacious for an unknown length of time, which may somehow be related to inhibition of platelet aggregation. Since transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) were found to be associated with PGE1 infusion, cerebrovascular evaluation must be conducted prior to considering PGE1 replacement therapy for the individual patient.\r"

The effects of both pentoxifylline and PGE1 were not noticeable at 37 degrees C but became significant with hypothermia (5.0, 12, and 48 seconds at 20 degrees, 15 degrees, and 10 degrees C, respectively, in samples with pentoxifylline of 0.3 mg/ml; 5.3, 13, and 46 seconds at 20 degrees, 15 degrees, and 10 degrees C, respectively, in those with PGE1 of 40 ng/ml). The results in this study suggest that pretreatment of blood by pentoxifylline or PGE1 could improve coronary microcirculation perfused with cold blood cardioplegic solutions owing to significant improvement of the deformability of red blood cells.\r"

The measurement properties of this test have not, however, been well documented. We assessed the test-retest reliability of treadmill walking endurance in 10 normal subjects with a mean (+/- 1SD) age of 27.5 (+/- 3.3) years. On four occasions, at intervals of at least one week, each subject walked on a motorized treadmill to the limits of his or her capabilities. With the standard protocol, subjects began at a very low exercise intensity (0.25 m/sec, 0% grade), which increased in either speed or grade at ninety-second intervals through a maximum of fifteen stages to 2.75 m/sec and 20% grade. On the final occasion, 5 of the subjects were tested twice with a fifteen-minute interval, using a truncated protocol starting at stage five (1.25 m/sec, 0% grade). Within-subject standard deviations were low, averaging twenty-three seconds (2.1%). Reliability was very high for the first three tests with the standard protocol (r greater than or equal to 0.98, p less than 0.0001) and for the 5 subjects tested and retested with the short interval and truncated protocol (r = 0.99, p less than 0.0002), while the correlation between the standard protocol and the truncated protocol was somewhat lower (r greater than 0.81, p less than 0.01). For young normal subjects the measurement of walking endurance with an incremental treadmill test is highly reliable, but the limits of reliability need to be considered when conclusions are drawn from such measures.\r"

The second cycle lasted three weeks, during which ketanserin, a selective antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2) receptors, was administered. The therapeutic effect consisted of the complete healing of digital ulcers in 4 of 5 patients and a considerable decrease in the number, length, and severity of daily attacks. To evaluate the digital blood flow, each patient was submitted to a medical dynamic telethermographic test. This, after the cooling test, demonstrated an average decrease of twenty minutes in the time necessary to reestablish basal thermal conditions (T') at the end of an adequate period of therapy using optimal doses of the drug. The authors affirm that orally administered ketanserin has a beneficial effect and can be well tolerated in subjects with Raynaud's phenomenon.\r"

This might account for the observation of Schwartz, who reported the presence of multiple microthrombi in the subendocardial blood vessels following AMI but found only a few thrombotic occlusions in the main coronary arteries. This washing-out of the vessel (due to reperfusion waves) intermittently releases myoglobin into the serum and is responsible for the \"staccato phenomenon.\" We examined a group of 177 patients with a mean age of 66.1 years, whose sudden death was definitely of cardiac origin. Infarction was confirmed in 84.7% of the subjects (fresh infarct: 23.7%; fresh infarct with scarring: 25.9%; scarring alone: 35.0%; no change in myocardium: 15.2%). In other words, 49.7% of all postmortem subjects (88 cases) showed fresh infarction. Opening the coronary arteries longitudinally revealed only 7 thrombi in these 88 cases, i.e., 7.9% of all fresh infarcts. These observations confirm those of Roberts (8.5%) and Friedmann (4%).\r"

It was also found that the storage mite Blomia tropicalis occurred in 96% of the samples examined and contributed an average of 15% of the total mites. The genera Tyrophagus and Tarsonemus were infrequent but occasionally large contributors to the bedding dust fauna. In our area, therefore, sensitivity to those abundant nonpyroglyphid mites should be routinely investigated in house dust-sensitive patients.\r"

With respect to bronchitis, however, as a result of the data on age of onset and the temporal relationship with the adoption of smoking, the possibility that cigarette smoking among adolescents may contribute to bronchitis cannot be dismissed.\r"

Three days later the same dose of theophylline was administered, but then 50 g activated charcoal was placed through a nasogastric tube into the duodenum every hour for eight doses. In all five animals tested, activated charcoal significantly decreased the area under the serum concentration-time curve, decreased the half-life of elimination, and increased the clearance of theophylline. This effect on pharmacokinetics was not seen when the nasogastric tube was put into the stomach instead of the small bowel because the charcoal administered did not pass beyond the pylorus. In a separate experiment in which bile theophylline concentrations were measured, it was demonstrated that enhanced elimination was not from interruption of enterohepatic circulation of theophylline. This suggests that the demonstrated physiologic mechanism is that of gastrointestinal dialysis.\r"

Transient ataxia or over-sedation occurred in three of 62 patients (5%) and was exacerbated by concurrent ethanol, diazepam, or phenytoin (six of 17), who were excluded from the study. We conclude that IV-PB is a safe and efficacious therapy for mild to moderate AWS, and IV-PB may prevent AW seizures.\r"

  ".W": "The ECG and the determination of serum enzymes creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be falsely normal early in acute myocardial infarction. Myoglobin, an oxygen-carrying protein found in cardiac muscle and striated skeletal muscle, presents an attractive alternative to CPK and LDH in the emergency department setting for identification of acute myocardial infarction. Myoglobin levels may be elevated in the serum within one hour after myocardial cell death with peak levels reached within four to six hours. We report a study of 59 patients presenting to a community hospital with chest pain and subsequent hospitalization. Twenty-one had an acute myocardial infarction. Presenting (0 hour) myoglobin determination was positive in 13 of 21 individuals, while CPK-MB was positive in only three. Serum myoglobin elevation at three hours identified all 21 patients with myocardial infarction with the CPK-MB determination positive in 19. Serum myoglobin elevation may permit early identification of myocardial infarction, with subsequent verification using CPK-MB determination, allowing appropriate intensive care admission for careful monitoring of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted an analysis of all complaints received in a busy suburban emergency department during 1985. All complaints were handled in a standardized fashion, and were categorized as billing, physician, nursing, or miscellaneous. Data were expressed as a \"complaint frequency\" (complaints per 1,000 patient visits). Complaints were analyzed for the following characteristics: reason, gender of the patient, gender of the complaining party, relationship of the complaining party to the patient, health care provider, patient age, and patient disposition. The chi-square method was used to identify characteristics associated with a high risk for complaints. There were a total of 244 complaints, arising from 64,910 patient visits, yielding an overall complaint frequency of 3.8. The largest number of complaints (135), involved billing (frequency, 2.0). The most common (60) was insurance carrier rejection of the bill as a nonemergency. The next most common billing complaint (25) was a charge mistakenly billed too high by the ED. There were 70 complaints regarding emergency physicians, for a complaint frequency of 1.1. Of these, 17 were due to a perceived lack of communication with the patient, the patient's family, or the patient's private physician. Eighteen complaints were regarding a perceived misdiagnosis. One physician had a significantly higher complaint frequency than the group as a whole (P less than .005). There were 17 complaints regarding the nursing staff, for a complaint frequency of 0.2. Twenty-two complaints were classified as miscellaneous. Expressing data as complaint frequencies allows comparison of trends in a department, staff members, and different EDs with varied patient populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In January 1986, 66 of 67 residencies (98%) were contacted by phone, and 62 (94%) completed a validation form. Of the 67, 19 (28%) changed their length of training in 1987-88. Of the 19 programs that changed, 17 (90%) increased residency length by adding a fourth postgraduate (PGY-4) year of training. Two have moved to PGY-1,2,3 configurations. Two new programs are starting in 1987-88; one a PGY-1,2,3, the other a PGY-2,3,4. One program has lost accreditation for emergency medicine training. In 1986-87, 44 of 67 (66%) programs were 36 months long; for 1987-88 the number is 60 of 68 (88%). The number of four-year programs is increased from six (9%) to eight (12%). Both the average length of emergency medicine residency training and the average length of postgraduate training are increased in 1987-88. The number of programs whose graduates train for a minimum of four years prior to sitting for the boards has increased from eight (12%) to 26 (38%). The number of programs that begin at the PGY-I level increased from 48 (72%) to 50 (74%). The Midwest region has the greatest number of residencies and the most programs of the PGY-1,2,3 configuration. The implications of this change, including new curriculum development, differing training patterns, and budget concerns, are discussed.\r"

Shocks were delivered more quickly following paramedic arrival with self-adhesive pads than with hand-held paddles (1.6 vs 2.5 min; P less than .001). Ventricular fibrillation was terminated more frequently when shocks were delivered using the self-adhesive pads (55 of 58 patients, 95%) than when shocks were delivered using hand-held paddles (49 of 69 patients, 71%; P less than .005). Initial shocks delivered with self-adhesive pads were especially effective, converting 40 of 58 (69%) patients to an organized rhythm on the first or second shock; this was true of only 24 of 69 (35%) patients shocked with hand-held paddles (P less than .001). Patient survival to hospital admission improved when self-adhesive pads were used: 30 of the 58 (52%) patients shocked with self-adhesive pads achieved hospital admission, while only 21 of 69 patients (30%; P less than .025) survived to admission when hand-held paddles were used. In addition, electrical artifact that interfered with accurate rhythm interpretation was far more prevalent when standard monitoring electrodes were used, including artifact that resulted in inappropriate shock delivery (23% of patients monitored with standard electrodes vs 3% of patients monitored with self-adhesive pads; P less than .005). Self-adhesive monitor/defibrillation pads are superior to standard monitoring leads and hand-held electrode paddles in the management of prehospital ventricular fibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "In order to assess the effects of cigarette smoke and asbestos exposure, we divided guinea pigs into 4 groups: smoking or nonsmoking, and asbestos-exposed or not asbestos-exposed groups. Asbestos-exposed animals were given a single intratracheal instillation of 5 mg UICC amosite, a dose and method of administration that we have previously shown produces morphologic changes in the small airways as well as minimal interstitial fibrosis. Animals were smoked 5 days per week for 6 months. By itself, smoking did not affect lung collagen content, small airways wall thickness, or the volume fraction of tissue surrounding airways, but it did cause a significant increase in alveolar mean linear intercept (Lm). Asbestos alone increased collagen content, airway wall thickness, and tissue volume fraction surrounding airways, the latter measure used to assess interstitial fibrosis. An unexpected finding was that asbestos also increased Lm. The two agents administered together caused more severe changes of all types than were produced by either agent alone, and the interaction between the 2 was generally synergistic. Smoke-exposed animals retained 3 times the asbestos fiber burden of those not smoke-exposed; the increase in retention was greater for short than for long fibers. We conclude that cigarette smoke can potentiate the fibrosis induced by asbestos, possibly because of increased fiber retention. As well, in this model, asbestos or asbestos plus cigarette smoke produces increases in alveolar size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Type IV procollagen (PC) is a major structural component of alveolar basement membranes; however, the mechanisms of type IV deposition in lung matrix have not been defined. We have examined the deposition and cross-linking of newly synthesized type IV in slices of adult rat lung. Type IV was rapidly deposited and selectively and covalently cross-linked in lung matrix. After a 4-h labeling with radioactive L-proline, greater than 40% of the newly synthesized type IV was insoluble in neutral salt buffers or 2 M guanidine-HCl (GuHCl). Re-extraction of the GuHCl residue in the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) recovered greater than 80% of the remaining type IV. By contrast, less than 20% of the total type IV PC was solubilized with 1 M NaCl containing as much as 50 mM DTT. The GuHCl plus DTT extracts contained pro alpha chains and aggregates of pro alpha chains stabilized by nondisulfide cross-links involving the pepsin-sensitive carboxy-terminal domain of the pro alpha 1 (IV) chain. There was a time-dependent increase in the recovery of type IV participating in intermolecular disulfide and nondisulfide bonds, and in the recovery of cross-linked amino-terminal domains (i.e., \"7S-collagen\"). Our results further support the hypothesis that the intact secreted form of type IV PC is a major structural subunit of pulmonary basement membranes, and demonstrate that the rapid insolubilization of type IV in lung matrix involves the formation of strong noncovalent interactions that are stabilized by intermolecular disulfide and nondisulfide bonds involving the terminal domains of type IV procollagen.\r"

  ".W": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology characterized by inflammation of the lower respiratory tract and injury and fibrosis of the lung parenchyma. Neutrophils are a significant component of the alveolitis of IPF, and are known to have a potent armamentarium of mediators capable of damaging the lung parenchyma. To evaluate the ability of 2 pharmacologic agents, corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, to suppress the neutrophil component of the inflammation of IPF, bronchoalveolar lavage was used to monitor those patients with active disease (greater than 10% neutrophils recovered by lavage). Those patients treated with corticosteroids alone showed no suppression in the neutrophil component of the alveolitis after 3 months and at 6 months of therapy (p greater than 0.8, both compared to before therapy). In marked contrast, patients treated with cyclophosphamide, alone or with corticosteroids, showed a significant reduction in the neutrophil alveolitis at 3 months (cyclophosphamide alone, p less than 0.01; cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids, p less than 0.02; both compared to before therapy) and at 6 months (cyclophosphamide alone, p less than 0.01; compared to before therapy). Pulmonary function tests at the beginning and end of the study were not different in any of the treatment groups. Thus, cyclophosphamide, alone or in combination with corticosteroids, is much more effective than corticosteroids alone in suppressing the neutrophil component of the inflammation of IPF. Whether or not this effect of cyclophosphamide will result in overall stabilization or improvement of the disease will require a larger, likely multicenter, trial.\r"

  ".W": "A high frequency of pulmonary infections has been a well-described feature of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Alveolar macrophages (AM) play a crucial role in pulmonary bacterial defense. We therefore examined the antibacterial activity of AM and generation of superoxide anion in 17 patients with SLE without clinical or radiologic pulmonary changes and in 8 control subjects. Total cell count and cellular viability of AM (trypan blue exclusion) did not differ significantly between patients and control subjects. Antibacterial activity v/s Staphylococcus aureus was significantly decreased in both untreated and corticosteroid-treated patients (respectively, -16.2 +/- 7.4 and -42 +/- 12% compared with the normal value of 51 +/- 12%, p less than 0.001). The defect of antibacterial activity was observed as well v/s S. aureus as v/s Escherichia coli. In contrast, chemiluminescence response of AM before and after stimulation by either phorbol myristate acetate or opsonized zymosan did not differ among control subjects and treated and untreated patients with SLE. We did not find any correlation between disease activity and AM function. Antibacterial activity of normal AM was shown to be significantly reduced by previous incubation with SLE serum compared with normal human serum. Thus, our findings suggest that alteration of antibacterial activity of AM may contribute to the increased susceptibility to lung infections observed in SLE.\r"

At all ages median and mean cotinine levels among nonsmokers and ex-smokers increased with the number of smokers in the home. The prevalence of a detectable level of cotinine was about 35% for those not living with a cigarette smoker and was greater with the number of cigarettes smoked by household members. In a multiple logistic regression model, the major determinants of a detectable level of cotinine in children were mother's smoking (odds ratio (OR) = 3.2), father's smoking (OR = 2.1), and smoking of other household members (OR = 4.0). Among adults, the effects of spouse's smoking were smaller with OR = 1.3 and 1.4 for husband's and wife's smoking, respectively. We conclude that in the general population cotinine can be frequently detected in the saliva of nonsmokers, even among those not living with a smoker.\r"

  ".W": "Receptor-mediated superoxide (O2-) release by alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes from smokers and nonsmokers was studied in vitro. When the cells were incubated with monomeric IgG or monomeric Fc(IgG) fragment, no cell O2- release was observed. However, when cytochalasin D (Cyto D) was subsequently added to the cell suspension, we observed a markedly enhanced O2- release. Neither Cyto D alone nor the double stimulation of following Cyto D with monomeric IgG induced O2- release. Concanavalin A (Con A) also had a priming effect on O2 release in combination with Cyto D, as did monomeric IgG or monomeric Fc(IgG) fragment. On the other hand, heat-aggregated IgG, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induced O2- release without the addition of Cyto D. Thus, we observed 2 different mechanisms in the receptor-mediated O2- release by alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Alveolar macrophages from smokers, which had a higher affinity and a larger number of monomeric IgG binding sites per cell than those from nonsmokers, were more reactive to the double stimulation of following monomeric IgG with Cyto D than to that of Con A and Cyto D, FMLP, or PMA, but for peripheral blood monocytes it was the reverse. We conclude that the binding of monomeric IgG to the Fc(IgG) receptor of alveolar macrophages or peripheral blood monocytes results in a priming effect on the cells for O2- release, and that the regulation of receptor-mediated O2- release by alveolar macrophages differs at least in part from that of peripheral blood monocytes.\r"

After challenge with 1 X 10(6) colony-forming units (cfu), the eradication of viable pneumococci from the lungs (pulmonary clearance), the generation of a local inflammatory response, and the prevalence of bacteremia were similar in both study groups. Cimetidine also failed to influence pulmonary antimicrobial systems after challenge with lower bacterial inocula (5 X 10(4) and 5 X 10(3) cfu). Further, treatment with cimetidine had no effect on the in vivo phagocytic or bactericidal activity of resident murine alveolar macrophages. Thus, in this animal model, cimetidine does not disrupt host defenses of the lower respiratory tract.\r"

Of the 70 patients who had received antituberculosis therapy in the past, resistance rates in Group II (n = 31) to isoniazid (INH), streptomycin (SM), and rifampin (RIF) were extremely high: 39, 29, and 19%, respectively. Nineteen percent showed resistance to both INH and RIF. In Group I (n = 39), INH, SM, and RIF resistance rates were 8, 5, and 8%, respectively. Of 283 patients who gave no history of prior antituberculosis therapy, those in Groups I and II(a) (n = 170) rarely showed INH or RIF resistance. Among recent immigrants from Latin America or Asia [Group II(b), n = 113], 11.5% showed INH or RIF resistance and 14% harbored organisms resistant to SM. Thus, the 3 variables that are most helpful in estimating the likelihood of drug resistance are a history of prior antituberculosis therapy, country of origin, and duration of residence in the United States.\r"

Rifabutin (ansamycin, LM 427) had no effect on the viability of resident or activated peritoneal or alveolar macrophages or on the phagocytosis of M. intracellulare by resident peritoneal macrophages. In activated peritoneal and alveolar macrophages, it had a dose-related effect on the phagocytic index and intracellular growth of M. intracellulare. Macrophages from mice pretreated with 10 or 20 mg/kg of rifabutin either orally or intraperitoneally for 4 to 10 days showed inhibition of intracellular growth of M. intracellulare in a dose-related manner. The route of administration or further addition of the drug did not enhance the inhibitory activity of these macrophages. These results indicate that rifabutin has the potential of killing M. intracellulare persisters inside macrophages.\r"

Acetylating activity was detected in all strains examined despite variable levels of aminoglycoside susceptibility. Substrate profiles revealed 2 different patterns of 3-N-acetyltransferase. One pattern exhibited broad substrate specificity including significant activity to fortimicin and was specific for Mycobacterium fortuitum strains, whereas the second pattern showed a much narrower substrate range and was observed for the other 3 environmental species. Both types of enzymes inactivated the antimicrobial activity of drug in vitro. The acetylation reaction of mycobacterial enzyme with radiolabeled acetyl coenzyme A was significantly inhibited by malonyl- (34.7%), propionyl- (21.3%), and butyryl- (12.5%) coenzyme A in the presence of adenosine-5'-triphosphate, whereas no inhibition could be observed for the type enzyme (3-N-acetyltransferase-III) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa suggesting the two enzymes are different. Thus all species of rapidly growing mycobacteria probably contain one of several different types of aminoglycoside acetyltransferases including some isolates and species without a resistance phenotype. The origin and specific function of these enzymes are not known.\r"

Accordingly, an enumeration of total acid-fast and MAIS cells by stain and culture (respectively) in groundwaters from three United States regions that differ in their incidence of human infection by MAIS was undertaken. Of 30 state-monitored, undisinfected wells, 11 were in Georgia coastal plain (high incidence), 10 were in the Virginia coastal plain (intermediate incidence), and 9 were in Montgomery County, Virginia (low incidence). Total acid-fast cells ranged widely between 280 to 5,367 per ml among the groundwaters, and with one exception showed no correlations or trends between regions of different incidence of human infection, or to total bacterial cell counts or colony-forming units. The exception was that the proportions of acid-fast cells relative to total cells were higher in the Georgia groundwaters. However, despite the relatively high auramine-O counts, few mycobacteria were recovered by culture. Of 12 wells yielding mycobacteria, 9 yielded rapidly growing and 4 slowly growing mycobacteria. Only one well in Montgomery County, Virginia (region of low incidence) yielded a MAIS isolate, albeit at low density. This research supports the conclusion that clean groundwaters are unlikely sources of MAIS infection in humans in the southeastern United States.\r"

The MIC values of 4 of the 5 drugs (the exception was streptomycin) were 2 to 4 times lower in 7H12 broth than in 7H11 agar. The broth-determined MIC were also at least 2 to 4 times lower than the achievable serum concentrations. The broth-determined MIC are probably much closer to the true MIC values than those determined in agar plates because of the lower degree of absorption and degradation in the liquid medium. The radiometric broth method is a simple and rapid quantitative method for accurate determination of the MIC values of the antituberculosis drugs. The data obtained in this study will be used for further evaluation of the MIC values as complementary or alternative to the conventional qualitative testing against critical concentrations.\r"

Grass pollen challenge was followed by a significant (p less than 0.05) dose-dependent and time-limited (5 min) increase in histamine level in 7 of 10 patients; these values, however, were lower than those found in basal conditions. In 8 of 10 patients with hay fever, antigen challenge induced a significant (p less than 0.05) dose-dependent increase in LTC4 level, which persisted for 30 min. The LTC4 generation was well correlated with the appearance of allergic symptoms; LTB4 production was found in 2 patients only. A different pattern of symptoms was observed after in vivo nasal stimulation with histamine and LTC4.

Aerosols of antigen were inhaled through the nose and through a tracheostomy in random order; there was a 1-h recovery interval between challenges. After inhalation of OA through the nose, Ru increased from 0.441 +/- 0.057 (mean +/- 1 SE) to 1.342 +/- 0.504 cm H2O X ml-1 X s (n = 6; p less than 0.05) and Rlo increased from 0.099 +/- 0.017 to 0.269 +/- 0.08 cm H2O X ml-1 X s (p less than 0.05). Changes in Ru and Rlo were strongly correlated (r = 0.938; p less than 0.001). After OA was inhaled through the tracheostomy, Rlo increased from 0.089 +/- 0.021 to 0.152 +/- 0.041 cm H2O X ml-1 X s (p less than 0.05). However, Ru did not change significantly. Pretreatment of the lower airways with inhaled atropine did not affect the magnitude of the changes in Ru after inhalation of OA through the nose but significantly attenuated the response of the lower airways. We conclude that when sensitized, spontaneously breathing rats inhale antigen through the nose, the predominant reaction occurs in the upper airways; changes in upper airway resistance do not result from reflexes originating in the lower airways; lower airway responses are mediated in part by cholinergic mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the contribution of histamine to bronchoconstriction provoked by inhaled allergen and adenosine monophosphate (AMP), we have observed the effects of prior treatment with the potent H1-receptor antagonists, terfenadine and astemizole. Nine mild, atopic asthmatics underwent inhalation challenge tests on 6 separate days with histamine, allergen extract, and AMP using single concentrations previously shown to produce a 30% fall in FEV1. For each agonist, bronchoprovocation was performed 3 h after treatment with either terfenadine 180 mg or matched placebo, and airway caliber assessed by measurement of FEV1 over a period of 45 min. AMP challenge was also performed after prior treatment with astemizole. After placebo, histamine produced rapid bronchoconstriction, reaching a maximum within 5 min and returning to within 10% of baseline at 25 min. Pretreatment with terfenadine abolished the bronchoconstrictor response to histamine completely. In contrast, bronchoconstriction provoked by allergen after placebo was slower in onset and sustained during the 45 min of observation. Terfenadine only partially inhibited this response to allergen by 50 +/- 10% (mean +/- SEM) with the maximal effect being observed within the first 5 to 8 min of challenge. AMP inhalation provoked rapid bronchoconstriction similar in time course to that of histamine, and this reaction was inhibited by 86 +/- 8.1% by terfenadine. Astemizole produced inhibition of the response to AMP that was almost identical to that of terfenadine. On the basis of in vitro studies, we interpret these differential effects of terfenadine as reflecting the contribution of histamine to the various airway challenges.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A thorough study of the possible role of this purine nucleoside in the pathogenesis of asthma has been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model. We have studied the bronchial effects of adenosine in an in vivo rat model. The intravenous injection of 0.1 to 10 micromoles/kg body weight of adenosine causes in BDE-rats an increase in lung resistance and decrease in dynamic compliance. Study of the potency of various adenosine analogs suggests that the bronchial adenosine receptor belongs to the A2-type. The bronchoconstriction caused by adenosine is inhibited by atropine, methysergide, sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil sodium, and ketotifen. Xanthines in doses of 5 and 15 mg/kg body weight have no significant effect on the adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction. These results suggest that adenosine causes bronchoconstriction by stimulating postsynaptic vagal nerve endings and mast cells.\r"

  ".U": "87296997\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine if proliferation of pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) played a significant role in establishing the PAM population of the lung during postnatal development. New Zealand albino rabbits were killed at 0.5, 1 through 5, 7, and 14 days and 4 months after birth and their lungs were lavaged. Cell yield in the lavage was determined by hemocytometer counts, and the percentage of PAM in mitosis (mitotic index) was determined from cytocentrifuge preparations. The total number of PAM increased from 1.5 X 10(6) at 1 day to 8.38 X 10(6) at 14 days after birth. The mitotic index (MI) was 0.6% at 0.5 days after birth, increased to 1.6% at 1 day, and remained elevated through 5 days. By 14 days, the MI declined to 0.2%. The cell cycle time (Ct) of the PAM population was calculated from the MI and ranged from 1.8 to 2.4 days during Days 1 through 5 of life. Direct measurements of the doubling time (Dt) of PAM in the lavage revealed that the PAM population doubled twice over this same time period. Because Ct was equal to Dt during Days 1 through 5, we conclude that proliferation of PAM was the primary mechanism by which the PAM population increased during the immediate postnatal development of the rabbit lung. No evidence was obtained indicating that migratory monocytes or interstitial macrophages were involved with this process of population expansion. This study adds to the growing literature demonstrating that the intraalveolar proliferation of \"free\" PAM is the major local source of PAM in the lung.\r"

This study reports the effects of 21 days of exposure to 87% oxygen on the resting and active mechanical properties and structure of pulmonary arterial segments. Segments from the hilar region, extrapulmonary and proximal preacinar, and selected distal preacinar regions were studied. Resting and active (KCl-induced) tension:circumference curves were determined for each vessel. Morphometric measures were made of vessels fixed at a standard circumference using computerized planimetry. The areas of the media and adventitia as well as vessel wall thickness were increased in hyperoxic vessels. The walls of segments from the hypertensive rats demonstrated an increased stiffness based upon analysis of vessel resting tension:circumference relationships while the tangent modulus (a measure of stiffness normalized to tissue dimensions) was unchanged. Paradoxically, despite medial hypertrophy in the pulmonary vessels remodeled by hyperoxia, active tension was reduced. This study reveals that the resulting hypertensive state is not readily explained by an inherent increase in the maximal contractile capabilities of the remodeled vessel. Rather, obliteration of vessels in combination with increased resting stiffness appear to be the basis for pulmonary hypertension induced in hyperoxia.\r"

  ".W": "Acute alveolar injury (AAI) was induced in dogs by injection of N-nitroso-N-methylurethane. Two to 20 days after injection, alveolar lavage phospholipids were quantified. Lavage surfactant was partially purified by centrifugation (27,000 g for 2 h), and further purified by centrifugation in NaBr density gradient (100,000 g for 4 h). Phospholipids, neutral lipids, surfactant-associated proteins, and surface properties of partially purified and purified surfactants were analyzed. Lavage disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) decreased to 37% of control at peak injury (Days 6 to 8) and increased to near normal during recovery (Days 10 to 20). Lavage phosphatidylglycerol (PG) decreased to 22% of control at peak injury and remained in that range through recovery. In both partially purified and purified surfactants, percentages of phosphatidylcholine (PC), DSPC, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol in all phases of injury and recovery were not different from those in control animals. However, percentage of PG decreased markedly during injury and remained low through recovery, whereas those of phosphatidylinositol and lysoPC increased with injury and remained elevated through recovery. The PC-to-sphingomyelin ratio (L/S ratio) and percentage of triglyceride decreased during injury and returned to control values during recovery. Surfactant apoprotein of molecular weight 38,000 from partially purified and purified surfactant decreased markedly at peak injury and recovered to normal during recovery. During early and peak injury, both preparations failed to reduce surface tension below 19 dyne/cm and their isopycnic densities were altered. These studies indicate that, in addition to decreased quantity, qualitative changes in lipids and apoproteins and reduced surface activity of the surfactant occur during nitrosourethane-induced AAI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aims of this study were to determine whether the antiviral agent acyclovir could prevent this occurrence, and if so, whether prevention improved the outcome. Forty-five patients with ARDS underwent double-blind randomization into a treatment group (22 subjects) who received prophylactic acyclovir intravenously, 5 mg/kg every 8 h, and a control group (23 subjects). Upper and lower respiratory secretions were examined for the presence of HSV before randomization and twice weekly thereafter. Seven patients were excluded because of HSV detection prior to treatment. There were no significant differences between the remaining 17 acyclovir and 21 control patients in age, sex, distribution of primary diagnostic categories, and severity of primary illness. Only 1 patient (6%) in the acyclovir group developed HSV after treatment compared with 15 (71%) in the control group (p less than 0.001), but there was no improvement in the acyclovir group in the severity of respiratory failure, the duration of ventilator support (acyclovir, 20 +/- 19 days; control, 14 +/- 11 days), or mortality (acyclovir, 8 of 17, 47%; control, 9 of 21, 43%). We conclude that acyclovir is effective in preventing the high incidence of HSV in patients with ARDS, but that this prevention does not improve outcome. Routine prophylaxis of HSV is not recommended.\r"

The aim of this study was to assess the ability of 10 cm H2O IPS to improve the efficacy of spontaneous ventilation. We studied 8 intubated patients recovering from acute respiratory failure, all were breathing spontaneously via 3 different systems: a Servo 900 C ventilator (SCV) without IPS, a Servo 900 C ventilator with 10 cm H2O IPS, and a continuous flow system (CFS). Compared with the CFS, breathing with the SVC without IPS resulted in an increased respiratory rate (RR), increased tidal Volume (VT), increased transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), and no significant change in PaO2 or PaCO2. Ventilation with IPS resulted in significant improvements in VT, PaO2, and PaCO2 with a decreased RR and Pdi when compared with both the other modes of spontaneous ventilation. A significant decrease in the pressure-time index of the diaphragm (i.e., the product of the mean transdiaphragmatic pressure and the inspiratory duty cycle) occurred during IPS. In 2 patients, we recorded diaphragmatic electromyographic activity during both SVC and IPS. In both patients during IPS, an increased VT and a decreased Pdi coincided with a major reduction of electromyographic activity. We conclude that IPS at a level of 10 cm H2O markedly increases the efficacy of spontaneous breathing while reducing the activity of the inspiratory muscles.\r"

In 6 infants, dead space loading or air injection was performed in an attempt to alter abdominal and rib cage volume contributions and thereby improve the calibration. Neither of these maneuvers resulted in an improvement of the accuracy of the RIP calibration coefficient. We conclude that, when calibrated by the least squares technique, the reliability of inductive plethysmography in measuring tidal volume in small infants is low. This is presumably because they have very small tidal volumes and highly compliant rib cages.\r"

At any given flow rate (0.2 to 1.0 L/s), PaCO2 was greatest with He and lowest with SF6. Data for all gases could be described by the equation PaCO2/Pb = 0.044 V-0.64 v0.23, where Pb = barometric pressure, PaCO2 is in mm Hg, V = insufflated flow in L/s, and v = kinematic viscosity (cm2/s). At any given flow rate, the AaPO2 was greater using SF6 than using He. These results are consistent with a 2-zone model of gas transport in which the enhancement of gas transport as V increases may be due to an increase in the turbulent diffusivity in zone I (the region affected by the jet). The decreased gas transport with He compared to air and SF6 at any V may be due to either the decreased penetration depth of zone I caused by the greater kinematic viscosity of He, or the decreased rate of gas transport in the region affected by cardiogenic oscillations (zone II) secondary to the higher molecular diffusivity of He.\r"

Although upper and lower respiratory epithelium can be analyzed premortem, it is uncertain whether postmortem analyses provide a valid indicator of the premortem status of the ciliary apparatus. To address this question, we studied nasal ciliary motility and ultrastructure from 2 patients 16 h after death. After placement of the epithelial samples in Krebs-Henseleit solution and warming to body temperature, normal ciliary motility and frequency were observed in both samples. The specimen then could be stored within the solution at 4 degrees C for subsequent reanalysis on later days for as long as 60 h after collection with no deterioration in ciliary motility, as assessed by video motion analysis. Quantitative assessment of the ciliary ultrastructure did not reveal any abnormality in microtubular arrangements, and good tissue preservation was seen. These studies demonstrate that postmortem collection of nasal epithelium samples can provide a valid assessment of premortem ciliary structure and function.\r"

The factors contributing to the severity of endothelial injury induced by neutrophils are beginning to be recognized. Close and prolonged contact between neutrophils and endothelial cell, induced by a variety of mediators, may allow for secretion of toxic products into a limited area and thus overwhelming local defense mechanisms. Similarly, the intensity of neutrophil secretion (proteases or oxygen radicals) once the neutrophil is adherent appears to be of critical importance. In this regard, the ability of bacterial lipopolysaccharides and lipid mediators such as PAF and LTB4 to \"prime\" the neutrophil for enhanced secretion of oxygen radicals and proteases may be relevant to endothelial injury especially in the complex environment of an inflammatory focus.\r"

Injection of purified C5a causes similar hemodynamic events, and the hematologic changes suggest involvement of components such as polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) and mediators including vasoamines and prostanoids. The anaphylatoxin-induced hypotension coincided with an increase in central venous pressure (CVP), decreased cardiac output (CO), increased plasma prostanoid levels, and neutropenia. These phenomena were repeatable in the animals when C5a was administered as a bolus 45 min after the initial treatment. Animals pretreated with indomethacin failed to exhibit the hypotensive response to C5a but still exhibited the transient neutropenia. Indomethacin effectively eliminated prostanoid release into plasma as expected. Administration of H2, but not H1, histamine-receptor antagonists reduced both C5a-induced hypotension and prostanoid release, suggesting that histamine may contribute to the C5a response in rabbits. Animals rendered neutropenic with nitrogen mustard prior to C5a challenge respond normally to C5a infusion (i.e., elevated prostanoid release and hypotension). The mechanism that we proposed for C5a-induced hypotension requires vascular smooth muscle contraction to be predominant over peripheral vasodilation in affecting cardiac output. Neutropenia occurs as a parallel event to hypotension but seemingly has little influence on the hemodynamic response. Prostacyclin (PGI2) levels were elevated in C5a-treated animals, and this lipid mediator contributes to hypotension by enhancing peripheral vasodilation. Because plasma TGxB2, levels were also elevated and central venous pressure increased as cardiac output decreased in treatment animals, we concluded that thromboxane-dependent pulmonary vasoconstriction contributes significantly to the C5a hypotensive response.\r"

Thrombin also has direct effects on endothelial permeability and can contribute to neutrophil sequestration in the lung by increasing endothelial adhesivity.

A vasodilator such as nitroprusside (151 micrograms/kg X min) can be administered in early ARDS and will lower PAP and PAOP (capillary wedge pressure) while increasing cardiac output (CO) from 6.9 to 8.75 L/min X M2 and venous admixture from 23% to 31.6%. This suggests diffuse vasoconstriction is present in early ARDS. In 19 patients with severe ARDS, 13 had vascular occlusions on balloon occlusion angiography, and these occlusions correlated with increased post mortem counts of PA thrombi. At autopsy, there was a considerable increase of PA medial thickness and a reduction of lumen diameter. This hemodynamic and morphologic evidence suggests both vasoconstrictor and anatomic changes play major roles elevating the PVR in ARDS.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the sensitivity of historical risk factors for identification for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive parturients, 4399 pregnant women were consecutively screened for HBsAg. Information regarding risk for hepatitis B infection was obtained from each HBsAg-positive parturient. Twenty-three HBsAg-positive subjects were identified (5.2/1000 deliveries). The HBsAg carrier rate (18/2231, or 8.1/1000 deliveries) was significantly higher in women of black, Asian, or Hispanic origin than in the remaining ethnic groups (non-Hispanic whites plus all others, 5/2168, or 2.3/1000 deliveries) (chi square, 5.95; p = 0.016). Risk factors for identification of HBsAg-positive women were present in 10 of 22 asymptomatic subjects (sensitivity, 45%; 95% confidence interval, 24% to 68%). Much of the information required to assess one of these risk factors, previous infection, involved detailed questioning and is unlikely to be obtained in the context of conventional obstetrical care. Routine maternal HBsAg screening programs may be needed if transmission of hepatitis B from mother to infant is to be prevented.\r"

  ".W": "Study Objective: To determine the efficacy of intravenous aminophylline in the treatment of patients hospitalized for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial during the first 72 hours of hospitalization. Patients: Thirty patients admitted from the emergency room or walk-in clinic with the primary diagnosis of an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Twenty-eight patients completed the study; 2 patients, 1 receiving placebo and 1 receiving aminophylline, were removed from the study because of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Interventions: Patients received either intravenous aminophylline or placebo, in addition to nebulized, inhaled 0.3 mL of a 5% solution every 6 hours; methylprednisolone, 0.5 mg/kg body weight every 6 hours intravenously; ampicillin, 500 mg orally every 6 hours (tetracycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were substituted in penicillin-allergic patients); and supplemental oxygen as needed. Aminophylline infusion rates were adjusted by an unblinded investigator to achieve theophylline levels of 72 to 83 mumol/L. Changes were also made in placebo infusion rates to maintain the double-blind design. Measurements and Main Results: The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) before and after metaproterenol inhalation were measured twice daily by a blinded investigator, who also administered a verbal dyspnea index with a scale of 1 to 10 and questioned patients regarding possible side effects of treatment (tremor, palpitations, nausea, or vomiting). Arterial blood gas measurements at 72 hours were compared with those obtained on admission. Significant improvements in FEV1 and FVC measured before and after metaproterenol treatment and in dyspnea occurred over time in both treatment groups (p less than 0.05 for all measurements). However, there were no significant differences between the placebo and aminophylline groups in any of the spirometric measurements or the dyspnea indices (p greater than 0.5 in all five analyses). The mean increases (+/- SE) in Po2 of 1.9 (+/- 0.5) kPa with placebo and 1.7 (+/- 0.7) kPa with aminophylline and the mean decreases in PCO2 of 0.5 (+/- 0.4) kPa with placebo and 1.2 (+/- 0.4) kPa with aminophylline were not significantly different (p greater than 0.6 for PO2, p greater than 0.2 for PCO2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We found that in 15,187 consecutive hospital admissions, 162 (1.1%) patients who were at least 60 years of age had serum sodium levels that measured greater than 148 meq/L. Of that 162, 57% had become hypernatremic in the hospital; the remaining 43% were hypernatremic at hospitalization. The mean peak serum sodium level was 154 meq/L (range, 149 to 182), and mean water deficit, 9% of total body water (range, 6% to 30%). The most frequent primary causes were complications of surgery (21%), febrile illness (20%), infirmity (11%), and diabetes mellitus (11%), with more than 40 causal factors identified. Depression of sensorium correlated with severity of hypernatremia (p less than 0.001). The mortality rate (42%) was seven times that of age-matched hospitalized patients, but was not predicted by severity of hypernatremia. Mortality increased with increasing rates of fluid replacement (p less than 0.008). Hypernatremia in elderly patients is usually iatrogenic and often a marker for severe associated systemic illness.\r"

We measured the bone mineral density of lumbar vertebras and the femoral neck by dual-photon absorptiometry and determined the biochemical variables of bone turnover in two patients successfully treated for Cushing syndrome who were followed for the next 24 months. Our data are the first to show marked increases in bone density (up to 20%) during the recovery period. The accompanying biochemical changes, particularly the marked increase in serum osteocalcin levels, confirm that enhanced bone formation occurred during the recovery phase. These findings suggest that steroid-induced osteoporosis can be reversed at least in young persons.\r"

Few studies, however, have examined the impact of different levels of sodium intake on the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs. We administered two courses of verapamil to 13 patients with essential hypertension during a low-sodium (NaCl, 9 meq/d) and high-sodium (212 meq/d) diet. Overall, verapamil was an effective antihypertensive agent, but expressed its greatest potency in the lower-renin, sodium-sensitive subgroup. Moreover, the antihypertensive efficacy of verapamil was not blunted by the high-sodium intake (change in systolic/diastolic blood pressure, 18.8/17.7 in sodium sensitive patients compared with -11.4/-8.7 in sodium insensitive patients; p less than 0.05). Thus, dietary sodium restriction may not be necessary or appropriate in the treatment of essential hypertension with verapamil; salt-induced cellular calcium uptake may be involved in the phenomenon of sodium sensitivity.\r"

To assess the adequacy of the risk criteria, all women presenting for delivery to a large municipal hospital were screened. Sera from 5356 women were tested, and questionnaires designed to identify women at high risk were completed by 78% of these patients. Sixty-four women were found to be HBsAg seropositive (1.2%). If the CDC criteria had been applied for screening, 30 of the seropositive mothers (47%) would not have been identified. Women from some Latin American and Caribbean countries not recommended for screening were found to have a relatively high prevalence of hepatitis B infection. Reluctance to give a history of venereal disease or illicit drug use may be another factor in the failure of the CDC screening strategy. To achieve effective immunoprophylaxis of newborns, all pregnant women should be screened for HBsAg carriage.\r"

Tubal ligation had been done in 3 of these 4 women. There were 37 episodes of hemoperitoneum; 22 occurred at midcycle and 15 with menstruation. One patient required repeated blood transfusion, but after oral anovulant therapy no further bleeding occurred and no transfusion was required. Two patients needed laparotomy: one for heavy intraperitoneal bleeding originating from a luteal cyst, and the other for severe lower abdominal pain from follicular and luteal cysts. Ultrasound examinations suggested the presence of small ovarian cysts in the two remaining patients. Recurrent midcycle hemoperitoneum in women on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis may be triggered by ovulation and associated ovarian cyst formation. Suppression of ovulation should be considered.\r"

We used these data to speculate about potential changes in ambulatory care programs in university teaching hospitals. All 15 practices participated for 4 years. One third of their patient population had no medical insurance. Practice patients had twice as many chronic illnesses as did the general population, and two fifths of patients stayed at least 2 years in the practice. Few faculty members spent more than 14 hours weekly in the practices, and housestaff worked an average of 4 hours per week. Patient waiting times did not meet ideal standards, but patient satisfaction was higher than in a general population. Compliance with quality of care criteria was not exceptional; for example, 10% of eligible patients received an annual influenza vaccination. Housestaff assigned a relatively low ranking to their educational experience in the practices. We recommend the institution of additional experimental programs in ambulatory care and housestaff education to improve the quality of care in the ambulatory setting.\r"

Physicians spent more than half their allocated patient care or supervision time in other activities and 14% of nursing time was used for direct patient care. Visits to second- and third-year residents cost one half of those to faculty. Faculty supervision of second- and third-year residents was limited; it was, on average, 2 minutes per follow-up visit. Despite these inefficiencies, bad debts, and educational costs, practices appeared to break even financially. We conclude it is financially feasible for university hospitals to provide primary care to disadvantaged populations.\r"

  ".W": "High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has recently been described in the treatment of patients with glaucoma. However, despite previous studies in animal and mathematical models, the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. We therefore undertook a histologic study of 15 porcine eyes to evaluate the effect of HIFU and, in particular, the changes seen after sequential insonification on previously treated areas of sclera. We demonstrated initial scleral swelling that was followed by scleral thinning. The scleral thinning could be maximized by a second superimposed course of HIFU. The most consistent change in the ciliary body was necrosis of the pars plana. Some treated animals developed a hemorrhagic retinal detachment that we believe to be due to the presence of a circumferential blood vessel, which runs in the ora serrata of the pig but which is not present in humans. Based on our observations, possible mechanisms of action of this treatment are discussed.\r"

In untreated rabbit eyes, paracentesis of the anterior chamber induced a 25% narrowing of the pupil. In atropine-treated rabbit eyes, the absolute pupil diameters were larger, but the pupil still contracted, resulting in a postoperative diameter of 6.5 mm. Pretreatment with diclofenac 0.1% eye drops effectively inhibited paracentesis-induced miosis; the postoperative pupil narrowing amounted to only 9% of the original diameter in both untreated and atropine-treated eyes. With a combined topical application of atropine and diclofenac, the mean pupil diameters after paracentesis were as large as 8.7 mm. Diclofenac seems to be a promising drug for the maintenance of mydriasis during eye surgery.\r"

We report the results of 84 extended supraglottic laryngectomies performed by our group from 1970 to 1980. Besides the highly favorable 5-year cure rate (75%), full functional rehabilitation followed in all but three patients, who were therefore submitted to secondary total laryngectomy. Rehabilitation time is often somewhat longer than in standard supraglottic laryngectomy, especially when an ample resection of the base of the tongue is required. Combined resection of the base of the tongue, aryepiglottic fold, and one of the arytenoids may further lengthen the rehabilitation period. We believe that extended supraglottic laryngectomy should be performed more often, not only for actual invasion, but also for suspected invasion of extralaryngeal structures.\r"

Standard diagnostic examinations usually were normal in patients with cervical symptoms. Pyrosis, regurgitation, and a positive Bernstein examination were uncommon in patients with cervical symptoms. This occurred despite frequent acid reflux (68%) and poor acid clearance (79%). Esophageal dysmotility also was common (63%). Patients with reflux but no cervical symptoms and normal subjects had a normal acid clearance time, and dysmotility was unusual (8%). We conclude that patients with cervical symptoms have diminished esophageal sensitivity despite frequent and long acid exposure. The pathophysiologic significance of this observation is discussed.\r"

Thirty-eight (12.5%) of the patients had asymptomatic laryngoceles, defined as air-containing structures in the supraglottic region extending more than 5 mm above the superior border of the thyroid cartilage during normal breathing. The incidence of laryngoceles associated with laryngeal cancer (29%) was higher than that for laryngoceles associated with other diseases (9%). No patient with an asymptomatic laryngocele not associated with laryngeal cancer showed evidence of a subsequent laryngeal neoplasm during close follow-up of 10 to 36 months.\r"

Comparing this series to those describing thyroid cancer patients of all ages, we found that thyroid carcinoma in the 70+ age group presents at a more advanced clinical stage, behaves more aggressively, and has a higher death rate. These findings are attributed mainly to the higher incidence of undifferentiated carcinoma and the more aggressive course of the differentiated types of carcinoma in the older age group. If suspected thyroid nodules are managed by initial radical treatment, carcinoma can be diagnosed earlier and patients will survive longer.\r"

To restore the normal physiologic properties of the vocal folds, the normal mucosa should be removed as little as possible in phonosurgery. When the mucosa of the vocal folds is extensively removed by surgical intervention and the raw surface cannot be covered with the local pedicle flap, it should be covered with a free mucosal flap. We found an activated human fibrinogen concentrate, which is a biologic tissue adhesive, to be suitable for adhering a free mucosal flap to the raw surface by a laryngomicrosurgical approach.\r"

Of a total of 52 isolates recovered from neck abscesses (1.4 per specimen), 34 were aerobes (0.9 per specimen), and 18 were anaerobes (0.5 per specimen). Of a total of 62 isolates recovered from head abscesses (2.0 per specimen), 20 were aerobes (0.6 per specimen), and 42 were anaerobes (1.4 per specimen). The most frequently recovered organism in neck infection was Staphylococcus aureus (20 isolates), and the most frequently recovered organism in head infection was Bacteroides sp (19 isolates). beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 36 isolates recovered in 21 abscesses (46%). Correlation between the predisposing conditions and the bacteria recovered showed a higher recovery of anaerobes in patients with dental infection or manipulation, tonsillitis, and fetal monitoring. Staphylococcus aureus was associated with trauma. This study demonstrated the importance of anaerobic bacteria in abscesses in the head and neck, especially in infections originating from sites where these organisms are the predominant flora.\r"

Clinically interesting observations regarding endolymphatic hydrops included bulging into the perilymphatic space of the vestibule. In 17 of 22 bones the saccular membrane bulged into the vestibule laterally and was attached to the footplate of the stapes. In two of 22 bones, Reissner's membrane in the hook portion of the basal turn of the cochlea bulged superiorly into the vestibule, occupying most of the perilymphatic space of the vestibule.\r"

The temporal bones were removed 4 days after the injections, and the cochleas were examined using the scanning electron microscope. The damage to the hair cells was recorded in cytocochleograms. The results show that spermine is cochleotoxic when given intratympanically. Dosage of 50 mumol for kanamycin A sulfate and 5 mumol for spermine caused total damage of the outer hair cells in all ears. Lower dosage of kanamycin A sulfate (20 mumol) and spermine (1 mumol) did not cause any histologically discernible changes.\r"

The osmolalities and chloride concentrations of the collected samples were determined. In another experiment, the continuous changes of potassium and chloride concentrations in endolymph and perilymph of the ST before and after the injection were measured by ion-selective electrodes. The osmolalities in CSF and perilymph lagged behind the increase in serum osmolality. The osmolalities in endolymph and perilymph increased gradually after the injection, reached maximum values after 90 minutes, and then decreased. The changes in chloride and potassium concentrations in endolymph and perilymph had similar tendencies. But the increases in chloride concentrations in perilymph of the SV and ST were much less than that in endolymph. We propose that most of the osmolality increase in perilymph is due to glycerol or other osmotically active substances and that the osmolality increase in endolymph is due to water shift.\r"

All patients were on respirators, had indwelling urinary catheters, and had creatinine clearances estimated to be greater than or equal to 40 ml/min. Tobramycin or gentamicin (40 mg) was instilled every 4 h directly into the endotracheal tube. Nine patients also received systemically a different aminoglycoside from that administered through the endotracheal tube. Urine was collected over a 4-h dosing interval at steady state (after at least 5 doses of the drug). The amount of aminoglycoside excreted over the 4-h interval was measured and expressed as percentage of the dose administered over that period. The range of percentage of dose absorbed was 1.5 to 34%, with a mean of 16.7 +/- 11.4% standard deviation and a median of 16.5%. The coefficient of variation was 68%. Levels of the endotracheally administered aminoglycoside in serum were measured, and all were less than 1.0 microgram/ml. While a large degree of variability in absorption was observed in this study, significant amounts of aminoglycosides could be absorbed in some patients. However, levels apparently did not accumulate in sera of patients with adequate renal function, and an empirical dosage reduction in intravenous aminoglycoside should not be necessary with the addition of endotracheally instilled aminoglycoside in patients with creatinine clearances greater than 40 ml/min.\r"

Serum clearances (mean +/- standard deviation) were 26.8 +/- 5.7 and 15.4 +/- 4.3 liters/h per 1.73 m2 in normal and anephric volunteers, respectively. The half-life (mean +/- standard deviation) increased from 4.3 +/- 0.8 h in normal volunteers to 8.6 +/- 3.3 h in anephric volunteers. There was good correlation between normalized creatinine clearance and both normalized serum and renal clearance. The regression equation for serum clearance (CLS) versus creatinine clearance (CLCR) was CLS = 1.97 X CLCR + 13.23, where r = 0.697; for renal clearance versus creatinine clearance, the equation was CLR = 2.26 X CLCR, where r = 0.845. On the basis of these data, we recommend a maximum 50% reduction in dose when ciprofloxacin is instituted at a renal function of 1.2 to 1.8 liters/h per 1.73 m2 (20 to 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Because of the observed variation in ciprofloxacin half-life in our anephric volunteers, we also recommend that a schedule of administration every 12 h be maintained, even for patients without urine output.\r"

Relapsing peritonitis after the cessation of antimicrobial therapy is frequently reported and often involves Staphylococcus epidermidis. To investigate the potential role of catheter-associated biofilm in the pathogenesis of relapsing peritonitis, we describe an in vitro model permitting the development of an S. epidermidis biofilm on silicone elastomer biomaterial. This model has been used to investigate the ability of vancomycin hydrochloride to kill biofilm-encased organisms by using an antibiotic regimen typical of peritonitis therapy. No significant differences were seen between vancomycin-exposed and control groups in biofilm viable and total cell counts after 10 days. Vancomycin-exposed silicone-associated biofilm populations decreased by only 0.5 log10 CFU/cm2 over the study period. MICs and MBCs for the original S. epidermidis suspension were 3.125 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. For biofilm homogenate suspensions, MICs were 3.125 micrograms/ml, but MBCs were greater than 400 micrograms/ml. These data indicate that the biofilm organisms associated with an indwelling peritoneal catheter may display a form of tolerance, thereby suggesting one possible mechanism behind relapsing peritonitis.\r"

The pharmacokinetic disposition of mezlocillin was determined in eight healthy volunteers in a randomized, crossover fashion after single infusions of 50 and 80 mg of mezlocillin per kg of body weight. Plasma and urine were assayed with a specific high-pressure liquid chromatography assay and analyzed by noncompartmental methods. Pharmacodynamic (bactericidal) effects were evaluated from serial serum bactericidal titers obtained after each dose by using the area under the bactericidal activity curve method. The mean mezlocillin total body clearance decreased from 203.6 +/- 36.2 ml/min after the 50-mg/kg dose to 171.7 +/- 42.1 ml/min after the 80-mg/kg dose (P, 0.01). The decreased clearance was reflected by a decrease in nonrenal clearance only (108.9 +/- 20.0 to 77.9 +/- 23.5 ml/min, respectively; P, 0.001). Mean areas under the curve for concentration in plasma versus time normalized to the 50-mg/kg dose were 314 +/- 73 and 375 +/- 64 micrograms X h/ml for the low and high doses, respectively (P, 0.01). No significant changes were observed in the steady-state volume of distribution or elimination half-life. Mean areas under the bactericidal activity curve were 100 +/- 77 and 244 +/- 143 for the 50- and 80-mg/kg doses, respectively. The decrease in mezlocillin clearance and the disproportionate increase in the area under the curve for concentration in plasma versus time, coupled with the observed prolonged bactericidal effects of the 80-mg/kg dose, lend support for administration of mezlocillin at a higher dose less frequently (e.g., 5 g every 8 h).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a randomized crossover sequence, the subjects received 200 mg intravenously or 750 mg orally. With intravenous dosing, subjects also received 651 mg of iothalamate, a marker of glomerular filtration, and 700 mg of antipyrine, an indicator of hepatic oxidative drug metabolism. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by model independent methods. In the CF subjects, the ciprofloxacin concentration in serum during the first hour after intravenous administration was higher, and the oral absorption rate was slower. Other parameters did not differ between the groups. Mean concentrations in serum 5 min postinfusion were 3.08 and 2.14 micrograms/ml, and mean peak concentrations after oral dosing were 3.24 and 3.34 micrograms/ml in subjects with and without CF, respectively. Mean values for elimination half-life in all subjects were 4.8 and 5.0 h after intravenous and oral administration, respectively. The mean renal clearances in all subjects after intravenous and oral administration were 19.4 and 14.5 liters/h and accounted for 64 and 47% of the total clearance, respectively. These values were significantly greater than renal iothalamate clearance, indicating that tubular secretion contributed to the renal clearance of ciprofloxacin. A total of 69 and 35.4% of the administered ciprofloxacin was recovered from the urine within 48 h after intravenous and oral administration, respectively. The mean bioavailability was 71.2% and did not differ between the groups. We conclude that similar dosing regimens can be used to treat patients with CF and their normal counterparts.\r"

  ".W": "Aerosol treatment with RU 41821, a glycoprotein extract from Klebsiella pneumoniae, was tested in mice for its effect on the kinetics of the induction of bronchoalveolar cells (i.e., alveolar macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes). RU 41821 led to an increase in the total number of bronchoalveolar cells. The largest increase was observed for polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and more moderate increases occurred in the numbers of alveolar macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes. The alveolar macrophages recruited in response to RU 41821 were activated, as indicated by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence in response to stimulation by opsonized zymosan. The effects of five RU 41821 aerosol treatments and those of a single treatment were further examined in vivo by aerosol infection of mice inoculated with a mouse-pathogenic influenza virus. The maximum protective effect was obtained after five once-a-day treatments and was correlated with the largest increase in the total number of bronchoalveolar cells.\r"

The elderly subjects had both decreased estimated creatinine clearances and decreased albumin concentrations in serum. Cefoperazone concentrations in serum of elderly persons were significantly higher at each interval from 30 min to 6 h for the 2-g dose. Compared with that in younger persons, the total clearance in elderly subjects was significantly lower for both the 1- and 2-g doses, the renal clearance was significantly lower for the 2-g dose, and the area under the curve was significantly higher for the 2-g dose in the elderly persons. The half-life at beta phase was higher in the elderly persons at both the 1- and 2-g doses but not significantly so. Changes in total clearance and area under the curve and higher levels in serum in the elderly persons suggest a longer duration of antimicrobial activity in this age group.\r"

  ".W": "The quantitative relation between granulocytopenia and antibiotic treatment was established for a short-term Staphylococcus aureus infection in the thighs of mice, using rifampin, benzylpenicillin, and erythromycin. Granulocytopenia was induced by total-body irradiation; the number of granulocytes decreased gradually during the first 5 days after irradiation to 10% of the number in normal mice. Experimental infections were established on each of the 5 days after irradiation. In animals not treated with antibiotics, the number of granulocytes in peripheral blood and the number of CFU at the site of infection exhibited a strong negative correlation. The influence of granulocytes on the effect of antibiotics on the number of CFU differed for the three antibiotics. For erythromycin the slope of the dose-effect relation was rather flat, but a decrease in the number of granulocytes caused a significant, nearly parallel, shift in the dose-effect relation, resulting in an increase in the number of CFU. For benzylpenicillin the slope of the dose-effect relation for normal mice was also flat, but as the number of granulocytes decreased the slope became significantly steeper, resulting in a diminishing influence of granulocytes at higher dosages. For rifampin the slope of the dose-effect relation, which was already steep for nonirradiated animals, increased significantly. Here too the effect of granulocytes decreased as the dose increased.\r"

The oleandrose units of the demethylavermectins were not methylated by the wild-type strain, but the C-5 of the macrolide ring was methylated. This demonstrates that methylation of the oleandrose units is not a terminal step in avermectin biosynthesis and that it occurs before attachment of the sugars to the macrolide ring. Avermectin biosynthesis thus differs from that of tylosin and erythromycin, in which methylation of the hexose moieties is a terminal reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Mortality before surgery must be taken into account when comparing the surgical mortality of atrial redirection procedures (Mustard's or Senning's operation) and the arterial switch operation for patients with complete transposition. This is because the switch operation is usually performed within the neonatal period or early infancy but Mustard's or Senning's operation usually after 4 months of age. The outcome of balloon atrial septostomy was therefore assessed in all 102 infants with transposition of the great arteries (plus or minus associated anomalies) who underwent the procedure at our hospital in the 10 years from January 1975 to December 1984. We considered the procedure to have been unsuccessful if the patient died from any cause (including other surgical procedures) between the septostomy and subsequent interatrial repair (Mustard's operation) or arterial switch operation. Eighteen patients died, although in only two was this as a direct result of the septostomy. Statistical analysis showed that low weight, presence of a persistent arterial duct, and coarctation of the aorta were significant risk factors. Early survival of infants with transposition of the great arteries has been dramatically improved after the introduction of balloon atrial septostomy. Nevertheless, there is considerable attrition before definitive repair, which must be included in the prediction of overall outcome.\r"

Thirty four had received treatment with an H2 receptor antagonist, and all but four had had a satisfactory initial response. Seventy per cent relapsed within six months of discontinuing treatment, and long term maintenance treatment may therefore be necessary.\r"

Only 6% of cases occurred in Asian children, but Asians accounted for 32% of all admissions with gastroenteritis and 59% of admissions with shigella. This unexpected ethnic difference may be due to limited contact with animals among Asians or to differences in diet.\r"

A family history of similar malformation was found in 15 cases (9%). Where anorectal malformation was the only abnormality in the family an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance was likely, except in one case where there was consanguinity. Where there were associated malformations no single mode of inheritance emerged. Two families with probably hitherto unrecognised recessive syndromes are described. In most cases of anorectal malformation the recurrence risk is low. Multiple associated malformations may indicate recessive inheritance and subsequent pregnancies should be regarded as high risk and full antenatal investigative facilities provided.\r"

Preterm babies with early neonatal hypocalcaemia had significantly higher concentrations of serum thyrocalcitonin hormone in the first four days of life than normocalcaemic preterm babies. Parathyroid hormone concentrations were similar in hypocalcaemic and normocalcaemic infants. In contrast, in the full term group no significant differences were detected in thyrocalcitonin hormone and parathyroid hormone patterns between hypocalcaemic and normocalcaemic subjects. This suggests two different pathogeneses for early hypocalcaemia in low birthweight infants. Hyperthyrocalcitoninaemia seems to be the main determining factor in preterm infants, while a non-hormonal pathogenesis should be considered in full term infants who are small for gestational age.\r"

One child died from complications of cardiac surgery rather than from the chylothorax, and surgical intervention was necessary in the remaining four patients and included pleurectomy in three and thoracic duct ligation in the fourth. Lymphopenia, hypoalbuminaemia, hyponatraemia, and weight loss were the most common complications of conservative management and tended to occur in those patients with the longest duration of drainage. Postoperative recovery after pleurectomy and thoracic duct ligation was uneventful. We conclude that conservative management of chylothorax will be successful in most cases.

This 'intermediate care ward' admitted 297 babies with their mothers during its first year of operation. We estimate that the opening of the ward led to a 20% reduction in admissions to the neonatal unit, without disadvantage to any baby. The indications for admission are outlined and the reactions of patients and staff to the innovation discussed.\r"

Although we do not consider these estimates accurate measures of soil ingestion, the method we used is a reasonable approach that, to our knowledge, has not been used before in humans.

The results showed that the group of workers who were exposed to carbon black dust had an increased prevalence of chronic cough, sputum production and wheezing and the mean forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1.0) and flow between 25% and 75% of the FVC (MMEF 25-75%) were significantly less than those of the nonexposed group. Multiple regression analysis showed that the decline in respiratory health was related to the influence of smoking and age, with only a small part being associated with the combined effects of dust exposure and age. A simple type of pneumoconiosis was found in 6 of the workers, all of whom had more than 10 yr of dust exposure. Carbon black should be regarded as a nuisance dust without specific effect on the lungs.\r"

This process has been known to result in the evolution of isocyanates. The patient's sister had also developed cough and wheeze after she performed similar home piecework. Neither the manufacturer nor the distributors of the wire had provided a warning of its potential respiratory hazards. This episode emphasizes the importance of the occupational history, and of following-back thoroughly on cases of occupational disease. In addition, this episode reminds us that home pieceworkers are unlikely to have benefit of advice from industrial hygienists or others skilled in recognizing potentially hazardous situations.\r"

In comparison to studies conducted prior to 1976, exposures to BSFTPM in the current study are consistently lower for every job classification. However, even in 1983, a large percentage of the workers in many of the sampled job classifications had BSFTPM concentrations that were above 0.150 mg/m3, indicating that current engineering controls and work practices are not sufficient to provide exposure levels below the recommended standard.\r"

After operation, 7 patients were classified in Stage I, 11 in Stage II, and 82 in Stage III. Major postoperative complications occurred in 27 patients and included pulmonary problems in 11, suture line leak in 9, wound infection in 5, empyema in 4, renal failure in 4, abdominal abscess in 4, bleeding in 2, myocardial infarction in 2, and chylothorax in 1. There were 3 deaths within 30 days of operation. Five-year survival was 85.7% for patients with Stage I disease, 34.1% for patients with Stage II disease (p = .052), and 15.2% for patients with Stage III disease (p = .001). Late morbidity included weight loss in 60 patients, dysphagia in 40, gastroesophageal reflux in 14, and gastroduodenal dumping in 5. Thirty-one patients required postoperative esophageal dilations (mean, 3.4). Most patients, however, were eating without dysphagia at the time of last follow-up or death. We conclude that the Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy can be performed with low mortality, can provide adequate palliation, and does result in satisfactory long-term survival for those patients with more favorable postsurgical stages of cancer. These results support the continued use of the Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for treatment of carcinoma of the esophagus.\r"

On postoperative staging, 15 patients had Stage III and 6, Stage IV neoplasms. Among 25 elective resections there was 1 hospital death, which was due to severe coronary artery disease. One patient who had an urgent resection for a perforated carcinoma died of multisystem failure 32 days postoperatively. Complications included splenic injury requiring splenectomy in 5 patients; tracheal laceration in 2 patients (only 1 requiring a thoracotomy); azygos vein laceration requiring sternotomy for repair in 1 patient; chylothorax in 1; recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis in 3 (temporary in 2); and transient anastomotic leaks in 3. Five patients had pneumonia with transient respiratory failure. Twelve of the operative survivors died of cancer 3.2 to 32 months postoperatively, and 12 are alive 3 to 28 months after operation. The actuarial survival is 53 +/- 11% (+/- standard error) at one year and 46 +/- 12% at two years. Transhiatal esophagectomy is a reasonable, safe operation that should be considered for tumors at all levels of the esophagus.\r"

In conclusion, the QB index, the QB/QS, or both should be maintained in the range of 1.6 to 2.4 L/min/m2 and 30 to 40%, respectively. In infants, however, it is advisable to control the flow at less than the range just given. Analysis of graft size in relation to body weight (BW, in kilograms) and body surface area (BSA, in square meters) showed that the optimal diameter (D, in millimeters) could be calculated by the following formulas: D = 1.88 In(BW) + 1.8 (r = .86) D = 0.87 In(BSA) + 5.3 (r = .73).\r"

Preoperatively, 7 patients (44%) were asymptomatic and the cyst was found incidentally on a routine chest roentgenogram. Esophageal symptoms were present in only 3 patients (19%), whereas most symptomatic patients had precordial sensations or arrhythmias. A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only 1 patient. After enucleation of the cyst, preoperative symptoms were alleviated in all patients and short-term results were excellent. However, long-term follow-up 13.2 +/- 5.6 (+/- standard deviation) years later revealed moderate reflux in 9 (64%) of the surviving 14 patients. During esophagoscopy, macroscopic esophagitis was found in 12 (92%) of 13 patients. On histological examination of specimens obtained by forceps biopsy, esophagitis was present in 10 (77%) of 13 patients and included Barrett esophagus in 2. We conclude that, despite excellent early results, long-term follow-up of patients who undergo operation for congenital esophageal cysts is indicated because of the increased incidence of reflux esophagitis.\r"

From 1970 to 1983, 71 patients underwent MVR + AVR with Hancock porcine bioprostheses. There were 46 men an 25 women ranging in age from 21 to 64 years (mean, 47.5 +/- 5 years). Sixteen patients (22.5%) died at operation. The survivors were followed from 0.2 to 11.5 years (mean, 5.7 +/- 3 years). Duration of follow-up was 313 patient-years and was 100% complete. Overall late mortality was 6.7 +/- 1.4% per patient-year (linearized incidence), and actuarial survival was 54.2 +/- 8% at 11 years. Endocarditis occurred in 4 patients (linearized incidence of 1.3 +/- 0.6% per patient-year); thromboembolic events were sustained by 4 patients (linearized incidence of 1.3 +/- 0.6% per patient-year); the event was fatal in 1 patient. Actuarial freedom from thromboembolism was 90 +/- 4.8% at 11 years. Reoperation for primary tissue failure was performed in 11 patients (linearized incidence of 3.5 +/- 1% per patient-year) with no deaths; in 7 patients both bioprostheses were explanted, and in 4, only the mitral bioprosthesis was replaced. The durability of explanted aortic and mitral porcine bioprostheses was not significantly different, and the evaluation of seven pairs of explanted aortic and mitral bioprostheses showed similar amounts of calcification. Actuarial freedom from reoperation because of primary tissue failure was 44.6 +/- 13.7% at 11 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Age at operation ranged from 24 hours to 14.5 years (mean, 6.9 years). Morphology of the tricuspid valves included Ebstein's anomaly (6 patients), congenital tricuspid regurgitation (3), tricuspid regurgitation and univentricular heart (1), and previous tricuspid valve excision for acute endocarditis (1). There were 4 early deaths: the 3 youngest infants in the series (age 1 day to 16 days) and another child who underwent emergency valve replacement died. On follow-up to 13 years after valve replacement, there were 2 late deaths and two reoperations. Both reoperations were for calcified degenerative tissue prostheses 6.5 and 9 years following implantation. The estimated 5-year survival based on a collected review of data from the literature is 68 +/- 9% for children with prosthetic tricuspid valves. Although tissue valve durability is better in the tricuspid position than on the systemic side of the circulation, calcification does result in late dysfunction. Tricuspid valve repair should always be carried out when possible, especially in the infant group. Elective prosthetic valve replacement in older children can be performed with reasonable operative risk and reasonable late results.\r"

This strategy facilitated rapid access to the mediastinum for evacuation of clot when the risk of tamponade from hemorrhage was deemed great. When sternal closure over a dilated and edematous heart caused hemodynamically significant cardiac compression, wound closure without sternal reapproximation facilitated hemodynamic stability. Postoperative correction of hemodynamic and hemostatic functions allowed delayed sternal closure to be done a mean of 2.8 days later. Thirty-eight patients survived to leave the hospital. Recognized complications of delayed sternal closure included superficial wound infection (3 patients), sternal osteomyelitis (1 patient), and fatal mediastinal infection (1 patient). Delayed sternal closure may be beneficial in selected patients. Morbidity and mortality related to this technique have proved acceptable in this high-risk group.\r"

  ".W": "From January, 1979, to December, 1984, at the Cardiac Surgery Department of the University of Torino Medical School, major sternal wound infections developed in 48 (1.86%) of 2,579 consecutive patients. These patients underwent open-heart procedures through a midline sternotomy and survived long enough for infection to appear. Possible risk factors were evaluated by means of a multivariate analysis. For the group of patients, we considered age, sex, hospital environment (different locations of our surgical facilities over the years), interval between hospital admission and operation, antibiotic prophylaxis, type of surgical procedure, elective or emergency surgical procedure, reoperation, duration of surgical procedures, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, amount of blood transfused, postoperative blood loss, chest reexploration, rewiring of a sterile sternal dehiscence, duration of mechanical ventilation, and days of treatment in the intensive care unit. Univariate analysis indicated that age, sex, type and mode of surgical procedure, antibiotic prophylaxis, and duration of mechanical ventilation were not significantly associated with wound infection. For all other predisposing factors, a p value of less than .05 was demonstrated. These variables were entered in a multiple stepwise logistic regression. Six emerged as significant: hospital environment (p = .0001), interval between admission and surgery (p = .041), reoperation (p less than .0001), blood transfusions (p = .031), early chest reexploration (p less than .0001), and sternal rewiring (p less than .0001). Contamination of patients may occur before, during, and after operation, and any kind of reintervention may predispose to wound infection.\r"

Eight components of social support were measured to determine the magnitude of their influence on adjustment. A new instrument, the Social Support Inventory for Stroke Survivors, was designed for this purpose. The General Health Questionnaire, used to measure psychosocial symptomatology, showed that 27% of the sample suffered psychosocial dysfunction. Multiple regression analysis explained 14.5% of total variance as due to social support and functional status.

Analysis of scale validity (content, clinical, concurrent, and discriminant validity) showed content validity to be low to moderate. Therapists found the scales more useful in identifying patient problems than in assessing improvement in function over time. There were low positive correlations between dressing, undressing, and ambulation scores and ROM scores on admission. Correlations between the American Rheumatism Association Functional Classification and scales of the RBFA were significant, while the Assessment as a whole and all four scales discriminated significantly between the functional abilities of patients on admission and discharge.\r"

We examined the effects of cold on the Hoffmann (H) reflex and on the tendon tap (T) reflex in 16 subjects. A series of H/M recruitment curves and T-reflexes were recorded via surface EMG electrodes before and during cooling of the triceps surae. Skin and intramuscular temperatures were recorded with average decreases of 18.4C and 12.1C, respectively. Peak-to-peak amplitude of the M, H, and T compound action potentials (CAPs) was measured. In all cases, the amplitude of the maximal M-wave decreased (p less than 0.001) in response to cooling. These changes in the recording of CAPs should be considered when cooling experiments result in alterations in H or T waveforms. When using the M-wave as a covariant in our analysis, there were no significant changes in the H-reflex amplitude; the height of CAPs elicited by T decreased (p = 0.025). Our findings do not support earlier claims that simple cooling facilitates the excitatory alpha motoneuron pool as measured by the H-reflex; we do confirm that muscle spindle activity, as measured by the T-reflex, is decreased by muscle cooling.\r"

The study population consisted of 154 spinal cord injured persons who were treated at our hospital between 1973 and 1979, and followed for seven years after injury. Demographic, social, and injury severity data were abstracted from each subject's hospital record. Motivation to work, employment history, and sources of postinjury financial support, were assessed by a vocational rehabilitation counselor. The study population was divided into four groups: persons continuously unemployed after injury, homemakers, students, and those employed at some time during the seven-year follow-up period. Stepwise discriminant analysis was used to develop a predictive model that ultimately included seven variables: gender, motivation to work, whether the patient's last job required ambulation, race, educational level, a functional ability score, and whether the patient had children. The model correctly classified 82% of those persons who were continuously unemployed, 100% of homemakers, 63% of students, and 72% of employed subjects. Overall, 79% of subjects were classified correctly. The most important classification errors were between the unemployed and employed groups. Seventeen percent of employed patients were incorrectly classified as unemployed, and 11% of unemployed patients were incorrectly classified as employed. Although there are other determinants of postinjury vocational status, individual potential can be assessed by means of a comparatively small set of predictor variables.\r"

The five devices include the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (touch); three-point esthesiometer (two-point discrimination); Pfizer thermal tester (temperature); biothesiometer (vibration); and Optacon tactile tester (vibration). Each subject was tested at 12 upper extremity (UE) and ten lower extremity (LE) sites. The threshold was determined by the two-alternative forced choice method. Results showed that the mean threshold for each sensory perception modality in the UE sites was significantly lower than in the LE sites. The means of distally located sites for two-point discrimination and vibration thresholds were significantly lower than the means of the proximal sites in the UE. In the LE, touch perception threshold was significantly higher distally than proximally. Distally located nerves (median and ulnar) showed lower mean threshold values than proximally located nerves for two-point discrimination. There were also similar findings for the other sensory modalities in the UE and LE. The mean threshold of dermatomes showed significant variation across the trials for two-point discrimination and vibration sensation. Distally located dermatomes showed lower threshold values than those located proximally. The means of most sites tested for each sensory modality (except vibration tested by the Optacon) showed correlation with age.

The mean values of standard deviation were provided for each peripheral sensory nerve and dermatome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The Family of Assessment Device and clinical data for 60 stroke patients were used to predict outcome at six months and one year poststroke. Ratings of behavior control and affective responsiveness of the family predicted number of days of rehospitalization during the study. Problem solving scores, family communication skills, and patient self-care ability predicted family-rated patient adjustment. Family function was a better predictor of hospital stay than baseline ratings of typical predictors of stroke outcome. Family function represents an area for potential stroke intervention that may have more relevance to efficient health care delivery and the clinical status of stroke patients than has previously been noted.\r"

  ".W": "Caregivers of 60 stroke patients were assessed five months after patient discharge from a stroke care unit to determine the relationship between family function and poststroke treatment adherence. Areas of family interaction which were significantly related to ratings of treatment adherence included problem solving, communication, and affective involvement. Better functioning families were consistently high on signs of treatment adherence. Findings suggest that families with specific dysfunction may not be as capable of helping patients comply with rehabilitation efforts as families who function more effectively. Thorough family assessment to identify which areas of family interaction are most problematic in relation to adherence issues is recommended.\r"

A case of partial Down syndrome is presented in which a cervical spine injury resulted in an incomplete quadriplegia. Possible factors leading to increased risk of SCI in partial Down syndrome are ligamentous laxity, atlantoaxial subluxation or odontoid abnormalities, neck inflammatory changes, and age below eight years.\r"
