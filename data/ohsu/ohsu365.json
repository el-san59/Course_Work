  ".W": "Leukocytes have been shown to play an important role in the development of isolated organ injury after experimental ischemia and reperfusion. To examine the role of leukocytes in generalized ischemia-reperfusion injury we used the MAb 60.3 (directed to the human leukocyte adherence glycoprotein, CD18) to block leukocyte adherence functions in a rabbit model of hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. In control animals subjected to 1 h of shock (mean blood pressure 45 torr and mean cardiac output 30% of baseline) followed by resuscitation, only 29% survived 5 d. All had gross and histologic evidence of injury to lungs, liver, and gastrointestinal mucosa. In contrast, 100% of the MAb 60.3-treated animals survived 5 d (P less than 0.01) and organ injury was absent or markedly attenuated. The control animals also had a persistent acidosis, lost more weight, and had evidence of continued gastrointestinal bleeding in contrast to MAb 60.3-treated animals. We conclude that increased leukocyte adhesiveness plays an important role in the development of multiple organ injury and death after generalized ischemia-reperfusion and that this injury may be significantly reduced by blocking leukocyte adherence functions with the MAb 60.3.\r"

  ".W": "The CD34 antigen is present on 1-4% of human marrow cells including virtually all hematopoietic progenitors detected by in vitro assays. Since the anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody 12-8 reacts with a similar marrow population in baboons, it was possible to test whether this antigen is expressed by stem cells responsible for hematopoietic reconstitution in vivo. CD34+ cells were enriched from marrows of five baboons using avidin-biotin immunoadsorption. After lethal irradiation, the five animals were given 15-27 X 10(6) autologous marrow cells (3.2-4.4 X 10(6) cells/kg) containing 65-91% CD34+ cells. All animals achieved granulocyte counts greater than 1,000/mm3 and platelet counts greater than 20 X 10(3)/mm3 by 13-24 d posttransplant and subsequently developed normal peripheral blood counts. Two additional animals received 184 and 285 X 10(6) marrow cells/kg depleted of CD34+ cells. One animal died at day 29 without engraftment, while the other had pancytopenia for greater than 100 d posttransplant. The data suggest that stem cells responsible for hematopoietic reconstitution are CD34+.\r"

The AgNORs were visualised as dots within the nuclei of the cells, and on the basis of their relative mean numbers of AgNORs fibrous proliferations of childhood could be easily differentiated from low grade infantile fibrosarcoma. The differences observed were significant (0.01 greater than p greater than 0.001).

Immunoblotting detected factor XIII subunit a in macrophages isolated from placenta but not in human fibroblasts. At lower dilutions, the commercially available antibody against the b subunit of factor XIII also positively reacted with the same cell population. The facts that immunoblotting showed that the antiserum crossreacted with the a subunit and that placental macrophages did not stain strongly for the b subunit also indicate that this antigen is not present in adult connective tissue cells.\r"

Seven patients had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and five various autoimmune diseases with one or more circulating autoantibodies. Serum samples from three patients were found to be HTLV-I-positive by the ELISA assay and sera from five patients showed a non-specific reaction by indirect immunofluorescence. These sera were negative when tested by indirect immunoperoxidase staining and Western blotting assay. All four methods gave positive results when tested with samples from 19 HTLV-I carriers and 16 patients with adult T cell leukaemia. Indirect immunoperoxidase staining and Western blotting assay are probably useful and more specific assays for the detection of anti-HTLV-I antibodies in samples from patients with autoimmune diseases.\r"

Twenty of the 80 women (25%) seropositive for specific IgG antibodies and one of 47 (2%) patients without these antibodies were culture positive (p less than 0.001). Compared with isolation, chlamydial antibodies at a titre of greater than or equal to 16 showed high sensitivity and negative predictive value (95% and 98%, respectively), but low specificity and efficiency (43% and 52%, respectively). Chlamydial IgA antibodies at a titre of greater than or equal to 8 showed low sensitivity (52%), but a higher specificity, negative predictive value, and efficiency of 81%, 90%, and 76%, respectively. C trachomatis IgG antibodies at a titre of 16 as determined by IPA can be used as an efficient negative exclusion marker for active chlamydial infection in screening women seeking abortion.\r"

  ".W": "Propranolol is a commonly used drug; of new and refilled prescriptions, it ranked no. 1 in 1984 and no. 2 in 1985. Medical conditions for its use include angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias, hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, migraine headache, hyperthyroidism, and pheochromocytoma. Almost all dental practitioners will treat a patient receiving propranolol for one of these conditions. The following recommendations seem appropriate at this time: The patient should continue to receive propranolol during dental treatment. Sudden withdrawal of the beta-blocker will cost the patient the benefit of propranolol therapy and may lead to acute myocardial ischemia. Acute stress should be minimized, as hypertensive responses may also be caused by endogenously released epinephrine. Short appointments scheduled in the morning, possibly with conscious sedation, should be considered. The dosage of adrenergic vasoconstrictors should be limited and gingival retraction cord containing epinephrine avoided entirely. The blood pressure should be taken approximately 5 minutes after local anesthesia is administered to determine if a systemic response has occurred. In the unlikely event of a hypertensive emergency, a rapidly acting, short-duration antihypertensive drug, such as the alpha-blocker phentolamine (Regitine, 5 mg intravenously) should be administered. Sublingual nitroglycerin (Nitrostat, 0.4 mg) may be useful as a nonparenteral alternative. These recommendations apply to other nonselective beta-blockers, including nadolol (Corgard) and timolol (Blocadren). They may also apply to labetalol (Normodyne, Trandate), a nonselective beta-antagonist with some alpha-blocking activity and to pindolol (Visken), a beta-blocker with some intrinsic beta 2-agonistic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most procedures involved the placement of two- and three-surface anterior and posterior restorations. Results were evaluated for pain control related to procedure type, patients' level of relaxation, sensitivity to pain, and patients' skepticism about the success of the reduction in pain during the procedure. Electrical analgesia with neurotransmitter modulator (TENS) was a valuable adjunctive tool for scaling, prophylaxis, and restorative procedures.\r"

Analyses were performed grouping the patients according to infarct location (anterior, n = 253; inferior, n = 218), infarct type (Q wave, n = 323; non-Q wave, n = 148), and both location and type (inferior non-Q wave, n = 85; inferior Q wave, n = 133; anterior non-Q wave, n = 63; and anterior Q wave, n = 190). Patients with anterior infarction had a substantially worse in-hospital and follow-up clinical course compared with those with inferior infarction, evidenced by a larger infarct size (21.2 versus 14.9 g Eq/m2 creatine kinase, MB fraction [MB CK], p less than 0.001), lower admission left ventricular ejection fraction (38.1 versus 55.3%, p less than 0.001) and higher incidence of heart failure (40.7 versus 14.7%, p less than 0.001), serious ventricular ectopic activity (70.2 versus 58.9%, p less than 0.05), in-hospital death (11.9 versus 2.8%, p less than 0.001) and total cumulative cardiac mortality (27 versus 11%, p less than 0.001). Patients with Q wave infarction similarly experienced a worse in-hospital course compared with patients with non-Q wave infarction, evidenced by a larger infarct size (20.7 versus 12.7 MB CK g Eq/m2, p less than 0.001), lower admission left ventricular ejection fraction (43.7 versus 50.6%, p less than 0.001), and a higher incidence of heart failure (31.9 versus 21.6%, p less than 0.05) and in-hospital death (9.3 versus 4.1% p less than 0.05). However, there was no increased rate of reinfarction or mortality in hospital survivors with non-Q wave infarction compared with those with Q wave infarction, and total cardiac mortality was similar (16 versus 21%, p = NS). To evaluate the role of infarct location and type independent of infarct size, patients were grouped according to quartile of infarct size, and outcome was reanalyzed within each group. Patients with anterior infarction demonstrated a lower left ventricular ejection fraction on admission and after 10 days than did patients with inferior infarction, even after adjustment for infarct size, as well as a higher incidence of congestive heart failure and cumulative cardiac mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Five hundred consecutive RR intervals were recorded and measured before and during varying right ventricular pacing rates. As anticipated, all RR intervals longer than the right ventricular pacing intervals were abolished. However, RR intervals shorter than the right ventricular pacing intervals were also eliminated. It is difficult to explain the elimination of RR intervals shorter than the pacing intervals with the accepted concepts concerning the mechanisms governing the rate and rhythm of the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation. An alternative explanation may be that during atrial fibrillation the atrioventricular node behaves as a nonprotected pacemaker that is electrotonically modulated by the chaotic atrial electrical activity. The result is a random ventricular rhythm. With right ventricular pacing, the automatic focus is depolarized by the retrogradely concealed conducted ventricular impulses, the short RR intervals are not generated as a consequence and the rhythm becomes pacemaker dependent.\r"

  ".W": "Timely administration of verapamil has been shown to reduce indexes of ischemic injury in experimental models of prolonged coronary artery occlusion, yet its effect on contractile function of reversibly injured (that is, \"stunned\") myocardium remains unknown. The objective of the present study was to determine whether verapamil--administered either 30 min before coronary artery occlusion, at the time of reperfusion or 30 min after reperfusion--could attenuate the regional contractile dysfunction and alterations in high energy phosphate metabolism produced by 15 min of transient coronary artery occlusion in anesthetized, open chest dogs. All treatment groups exhibited passive systolic bulging during occlusion. In the control dogs receiving saline solution, segment shortening in the previously ischemic tissue averaged only 31 +/- 8% of normal baseline values after 3 h of reperfusion. In addition, endocardial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stores were depleted by -8.7 +/- 0.8 nmol/mg cardiac protein to 26.5 +/- 1.1 nmol/mg protein, and endocardial creatine phosphate content increased by 9.6 +/- 4.3 nmol/mg cardiac protein over normal values. Pretreatment with verapamil essentially ablated the phenomenon of postischemic stunning: segment shortening was restored to 115 +/- 8% of normal after 3 h of reflow (p less than 0.01 versus control), endocardial ATP stores were partially preserved (30.6 +/- 1.2 nmol/mg protein; p less than 0.05 versus control) and creatine phosphate overshoot was blunted (endocardial creatine phosphate content decreased by -5.6 +/- 2.9 nmol/mg protein; p less than 0.05 versus control). Verapamil administered at or after reperfusion also attenuated postischemic contractile dysfunction: segment shortening for both groups recovered to 65 +/- 9% of baseline at 3 h after reperfusion (p less than 0.05 versus control). Verapamil given at or after reperfusion had no beneficial effect, however, on high energy phosphate stores. Thus, even when treatment was \"delayed,\" that is, initiated at or after reperfusion, administration of verapamil significantly increased contractile function of the postischemic stunned myocardium.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition could reverse left ventricular dilation and improve the diastolic properties of the left ventricle very early after coronary occlusion. The acute time course of left ventricular dilation and infarct expansion (as determined by two-dimensional echocardiography) and early diastolic isovolumic relaxation time were studied in 20 dogs subjected to 3 h of coronary occlusion. End-diastolic area before occlusion was 8.4 +/- 0.5 and 8.9 +/- 0.7 cm2 (p = NS) in the captopril- and the saline-treated group, respectively. At 30 min after occlusion (pretreatment), end-diastolic area increased to 12.6 +/- 0.8 cm2 in the captopril-treated group (p less than 0.01) and 11.3 +/- 0.9 cm2 (p less than 0.05) in the saline-treated group. Three hours after occlusion and after captopril treatment, end-diastolic area decreased to 9.4 +/- 0.6 cm2 (p less than 0.05 versus 30 min after occlusion), whereas it was unchanged in the saline-treated group. Functional infarct expansion (as assessed by end-systolic anterior to posterior endocardial segment length ratio) occurred early after occlusion, and captopril reduced this expansion. Pretreatment values for early diastolic isovolumic relaxation time increased from 29.1 +/- 2.4 to 50.5 +/- 2.9 ms in captopril-treated dogs (p less than 0.01) and from 34.3 +/- 3.4 to 46.9 +/- 2.7 ms in saline-treated dogs (p less than 0.01) after coronary occlusion, implying a worsening of diastolic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fatty infiltration was observed in the sinus node in two cases, AV node in two, AV bundle in six, bundle branches in one and ventricular myocardium in nine. Atrophy was prominent in the AV bundle in five and bundle branches in eight. Lymphocytes infiltrated the conduction system in three cases and were associated with myotonic dystrophy in two and varicella myocarditis in one. Ventricular myocytes were hypertrophied in seven cases, vacuolated in three and exhibited disarray in two. The distribution and extent of conduction system lesions tended to correspond to antemortem electrocardiographic abnormalities, including prolonged PR interval in six cases, intraventricular conduction delay in six and bundle branch block in four. Cardiac involvement by myotonic dystrophy may have contributed to sudden death in four cases.\r"

Here, we report the existence of a large intracellular pool of Mo3e Ag in addition to that expressed on the surface of activated U-937 cells. As detected by quantitative immunofluorescence analysis, permeabilization of unstimulated and PMA-stimulated U-937 cells revealed a latent pool of Mo3e Ag that was 75-fold and 9-fold greater, respectively, than the magnitude of Mo3e Ag expressed on the surface. PMA stimulation not only induced an increase in the relative proportion of Mo3e antigen expressed on the surface membrane, but also stimulated a 1.8-fold increase in \"total\" Mo3e detectable in permeabilized cells. Trypsin treatment of intact PMA-stimulated U-937 cells eliminated surface Mo3e expression but had little measureable effect on the total Mo3e pool. Permeabilization also uncovered a sequestered compartment of Mo3e Ag in I-937 cells, a variant of U-937 that is surface Mo3e negative. Although the PMA-induced surface Mo3e expression of U-937 was abrogated by cycloheximide, the total pool of Mo3e detectable in permeabilized PMA-stimulated cells was only partially reduced; cycloheximide treatment caused no reduction in the intracellular Mo3e compartment of unstimulated U-937 cells. Detergent lysates of PMA-stimulated U-937 cells exhibited undiminished quantities (relative to untrypsinized cells) of p75 and p50 proteins immunoreactive with anti-Mo3e mAb as detected by Western blotting. This trypsin-sequestered intracellular Mo3e Ag may serve as a reservoir for the up-regulated surface expression of Mo3e that occurs as a result of mononuclear phagocyte activation.\r"

One clone (U1) produced low levels of HIV but was found to increase its production 20-fold after PMA induction, as detected by reverse transcriptase or A capture. Further characterization of U1 indicated that PMA could induce cellular differentiation and maturation in the clone similar to that in uninfected U937 cells. In addition, functional studies revealed that superoxide anion production from the U1 clone was not different from that of uninfected U937 cells. Electron microscopic studies of U1 indicated that PMA induced endocytotic vesicles containing many HIV particles. These studies provide a model at the clonal level to 1) examine latency or chronicity of HIV infection in monocytes and 2) delineate the signals required for conversion to high level viral expression.\r"

Placental syncytial trophoblast does not express detectable levels of class I HLA; chorion membrane cytotrophoblasts bind one mAb to monomorphic determinants of class I Ag, W6/32, but not a second, 61D2. In the present study, sections of normal term placentae and matching extraplacental membranes were evaluated by in situ hybridization procedures for cells containing class I HLA mRNA using pHLA1.1, which is complementary to HLA-B. Class I Ag expression was identified by immunohistology using two mAb to class I HLA (W6/32, 61D2) and the mAb 4E to identify HLA-B. Placental syncytial trophoblast contained low to undetectable levels of class I mRNA and failed to bind all three mAb. Chorion membrane cytotrophoblast cells contained moderate levels of class I HLA mRNA and were positive with the mAb W6/32 but were negative with 61D2 and 4E. In adjacent tissues, fetal mesenchymal cells and maternal decidual cells contained high levels of class I mRNA and were positive with all three mAb. The results suggest that syncytial trophoblast may not express class I HLA because of low steady-state levels of class I HLA mRNA. In contrast, chorionic cytotrophoblast cells may express truncated versions of class I HLA or nonclassical HLA-A,B,C-like Ag. Regulation of the expression of class I HLA gene products may be essential to the development of a satisfactory immunologic relationship between the mother and her semiallogeneic fetus during pregnancy.\r"

The search for and identification of these factors has led to the discovery and molecular cloning of cachectin. This pyrogenic cytokine is identical to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and, when released into the circulation, causes profound shock and multiple organ injury. Cachectin antibodies protect against the lethal effects of mice given endotoxin and baboons given E. coli, a result suggesting that this mediator is both necessary and sufficient to provoke septic shock. Cachectin is produced in humans after endotoxin infusion; the infusion of small doses of TNF is associated with fever, rigors, headache, and hypotension. Septicemic patients also produce cachectin, and during meningococcal infection, patients with the highest serum levels of cachectin die. Chronic cachectin production causes a potentially lethal syndrome of cachexia, anemia, and protein and lipid wasting. Future investigation is being directed toward the development of cachectin antibodies for use in treating the humorally mediated systemic complications of infectious disease.\r"

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect serum IgG and IgA to the filamentous hemagglutinin and lymphocytosis-promoting factor of B. pertussis. Using criteria from ELISA values, we identified an additional 83 residents and 28 staff members as seropositive. Among seropositive persons, antibody levels were elevated by the time of onset of respiratory symptoms and, in three of the four assays, remained elevated for 14 mo. In 44 seropositive persons tested within two weeks of onset of symptoms, 80% were culture positive, compared with 33% of 15 tested two to four weeks after onset (P = .003) and none of 15 tested more than four weeks after onset. The most specific (94%) clinical case definition identified only 41% of seropositive persons. Thus, ELISAs are important tools for individual diagnosis and epidemiological studies of pertussis.\r"

Fifteen potential risk factors were evaluated, including the following: pretransplant CMV serological status of donor and recipient; recipient's age, sex, race, and cardiac disease; number and type of blood products transfused; type and intensity of immunosuppression; occurrence of rejection; and leukopenia. The Cox proportional hazards model identified both greater than average steroid dosage and positive recipient CMV serology as significant risk factors for CMV infection (P = .014 and .048, respectively). In a separate analysis, however, only greater than average steroid dosage was associated with clinically significant CMV infection (P = .005).\r"

  ".W": "The use of the nontoxic B subunits of cholera and Escherichia coli enterotoxins in vitro and in vivo led to a decrease in toxin binding to target cells and a decrease in toxin-induced effects (i.e., morphological effects, adenylate cyclase activation, and fluid secretion). The reduction in toxin binding involves a process of down-regulation of cellular receptors for the toxin and not toxin occupancy of receptors. The extent of inhibition was dependent on the amount of B subunit used and on the duration of time after its use. Thus, in vivo exposure to a single bolus of B subunit was sufficient to block toxin binding and activity for up to 18 h. Because the B subunit binds extensively to the esophagus and the stomach, peroral administration will require a preparation that allows the subunit to reach the small bowel in a protected form. Our data provide a rationale for using B subunit therapy for short-term protection against the effects of enterotoxins, before the development of an immune response.\r"

I have reviewed the evolution of stapes surgery during these last thirty years and tried to gain some agreement for several important facts about otosclerosis and several basic principals of stapes surgery. While a well-performed stapedectomy can eliminate the conductive component, the sensorineural hearing loss continues and, in about one-third, will progress till the patient, after age 65, must return to a hearing aid. A piston prosthesis gives the best hearing results: 0.6 mm diameter, when half the footplate is removed and a living oval window seal interposed, and 0.6 mm diameter when a small opening is made in the footplate obliterated by otosclerosis. I prefer a teflon prosthesis to stainless steel because it can be altered by the surgeon at operation, and vein as an oval window seal. I have presented a rare group of patients who develop facial palsy 5-1/2 days after uncomplicated stapedectomy, of whom all recover quickly and completely. I am confident that progress will continue to be made in the understanding of otosclerosis, and the performance of stapes surgery, but in these last thirty years we have made a good beginning.\r"

The patients were treated post-operatively for two days with either naproxen suppositories 500 mg. twice, or ASA effervescent tablets 1000 mg. three times, daily. The therapeutic gain was evaluated by recording the intensity of pain, reduced ability to open the mouth (trismus), consumption of supplementary analgesic (parcetamol), and pain-related sleep disturbances. The statistical analysis of the results revealed no differences in pain intensity, consumption of additional analgesics or pain-related sleep disturbances in the two treatment groups. A considerable degree of trismus was demonstrated in most of the tonsillectomized patients. This reduced ability to open the mouth was gradually overcome in the naproxen group while it remained unchanged in the ASA group, however, no statistical significant difference could be demonstrated. Additionally, no significant positive correlation between pain intensity and trismus was proven. The pain-relieving effect, however, was unsatisfactory in both the naproxen and the ASA group, and clinical controlled trial studies of alternative analgetics in tonsillectomized patients are still to be encouraged.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients with brain tumors were given a 30- to 60-minute intravenous infusion of bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR), 200 mg/sq m. Grossly viable fragments were taken from the biopsied tumor specimens and divided into two portions. One portion was dissociated into single cells, stained both with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) using anti-BUdR monoclonal antibody as the first antibody and with propidium iodide (for deoxyribonucleic acid), and analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). The labeling index (LI) was calculated as the number of FITC-labeled cells expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells analyzed. The other portion was fixed in 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with immunoperoxidase using anti-BUdR monoclonal antibody as the first antibody. The LI of these tissue sections was calculated in two ways: from selected areas in which the labeled cells were evenly distributed and from the entire tissue section. The LI's obtained by FCM correlated closely with those from the entire tissue sections (r = 0.99, p less than 0.000001) and were usually lower than LI's from selected areas of tissue sections. The LI's determined by FCM also correlated well with the LI's from selected areas of tissue sections (r = 0.82, p less than 0.00012), despite the difference in values between them. Thus, the FCM-derived LI and the tissue LI can both provide useful information for predicting the biological malignancy of individual tumors and for designing treatment regimens for individual patients with brain tumors; however, different standards should be used to interpret the LI's obtained by these two methods.\r"

Those changes affect therapy for endometritis since it may take several weeks for a return to the pregravid state. Preeclampsia is associated with reductions in intravascular space, increased extravascular space from edema and impaired renal function. Postpartum uterine changes may also complicate drug therapy because of poor antibiotic perfusion. The ideal antibiotic for postpartum endometritis would achieve optimal uterine tissue levels, be administered infrequently, and have adequate activity against anaerobes and minimal toxicity.\r"

New, more-effective means of prevention, diagnosis and treatment are being sought using research techniques in microbiology, immunology and behavioral science. In the meantime, medical screening, treatment and contact tracing should be carried out for patients and their sexual partners. Sexually active individuals must be empowered with knowledge and emboldened to protect themselves and their established or potential families from these common infections.

Thus, an understanding of the microbiology of the female genital tract is important in the informed selection of therapy for PID. Chlamydia trachomatis plays an important role in PID, and tetracycline and erythromycins are the agents most active against those infections. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is also an important pathogen in PID, particularly in a lower socioeconomic, urban setting. The treatment regimens currently recommended for penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae are spectinomycin and a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. Other bacterial flora of the female genital tract, including the facultative enteric bacilli, gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes, play an important pathogenic role in PID. Among the broad-spectrum cephalosporins, ceftizoxime has been shown to possess greater activity against isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group and enteric bacilli than do the related agents, cefoxitin and cefotetan.\r"

Less-aggressive surgical approaches to chronic pelvic inflammatory disease and even tuboovarian abscess, when possible, can preserve some part of the pelvic anatomy in these women, who may then undergo reconstructive pelvic surgery or in vitro fertilization. Due to the recent technological revolution in infertility therapy, preservation of a women's uterus alone is all that is necessary to sustain the hope for a pregnancy.\r"

However, if the drug is not optimal for treatment and sequelae of a disease process develop, no true savings are gained. The goal of treating pelvic inflammatory disease should not be just reduction of morbidity but preservation of fertility and reduction of surgery after therapy. Multiple factors must be considered when choosing antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease, including the spectrum of pathogenic organisms involved, the efficacy of the antibiotic chosen, the safety profile of the antibiotic, the pattern of resistance to the antibiotic in both the hospital and the community, the cost of administering the antibiotic and management of its side effects. This paper reviews the concepts used at the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, University of Chicago, in choosing the primary antibiotic, ceftizoxime, for the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease. This antibiotic offers a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity with little resistance, few side effects, evidence of penetration into the infected tissues and prolonged dosing intervals, which allow substantial cost savings as well as efficacious treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.\r"

The diagnosis of tuboovarian complex is made by history, pelvic examination and ultrasonography. Tuboovarian abscesses (TOAs) are sequelae of surgical procedures. Both conventional and novel surgical techniques can be used to manage them. Pelvic thrombophlebitis and ovarian vein thrombosis are late complications of pelvic infections that may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\r"

Untreated pyelonephritis is clearly associated with premature labor; however, the association of asymptomatic bacteriuria, appropriately treated pyelonephritis and premature labor is less clear. Some microorganisms have been demonstrated to produce phospholipase A2 and possibly prostaglandins, which might be the mechanism for some of the associations between premature labor and bacteria.\r"

These cells were selected for transformation in the presence of zinc, a known inducer of the mt-1 promoter. When the transfected cells were grown in medium depleted of zinc, there was a dramatic reduction in their soft agar cloning efficiency. Adding zinc back to the medium restored the transformed phenotype in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of the intracellular p21 levels of induced and uninduced cells showed that zinc was modulating the expression of the transfected ras gene. In vivo studies done with syngeneic mice showed that zinc-induced cells were tumorigenic and formed metastatic lesions in the lungs of the inoculated animals.\r"

Six patients were given 7 courses of carboplatin at 200 mg/m2/day; 3 patients received 5 courses at 250 mg/m2; 9 patients received 11 courses at 300 mg/m2; 2 patients initially treated at 200 mg/m2 were given their 2nd course at 300 mg/m2. Significant hearing loss documented by audiometry occurred in five patients, including three of nine treated at 300 mg/m2. All five had prior or recent exposure to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Three patients developed cancer and acute leukemia group B grade 3 or 4 mucositis, and 18 of 23 courses were complicated by nausea and vomiting. Marrows were hypocellular or aplastic in all patients treated at the highest dose. No complete responses occurred, although two patients with ANLL treated at 300 mg/m2 achieved partial responses lasting 71 and 138 days. The t1/2 alpha [half-life (t1/2)], t1/2 beta, and total body clearance of ultrafilterable platinum were comparable to those previously described by us in patients receiving bolus doses of carboplatin of 22-77 mg/m2/day X 5.

It provides a useful guide to the development and interpretation of preclinical studies and clinical trials. Despite the clarity and usefulness of the theory, there are misunderstandings of its implications and technical problems associated with its implementation. Few studies have been properly designed to validate the theory experimentally. Independence of steady-state pharmacokinetic advantage on intraregion blood flow differences predicted for a nonextracted drug is counterintuitive. Extrapolation from laboratory animals to humans raises some important questions of allometry, particularly for the brain, which does not follow the scaling rules applicable to other organs. Finally, drug streaming from the site of infusion has been observed in vitro and in vivo. The extent of the resulting clinical problem has not been adequately characterized, but it may be severe under some circumstances.\r"

RA-233 plus chemotherapy was compared with chemotherapy alone in a 5-year double-blind trial involving 719 patients with advanced carcinomas of the lung and of the colon. RA-233 treatment was associated with a statistically significant prolongation of survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (N-SCLC) limited to one hemithorax and with reduction in mean plasma fibrogen concentration. RA-233 was not toxic. The favorable effects on survival could not be explained by any factor other than the RA-233 treatment. In other tumor categories tested, no differences in survival were observed. These results suggest that RA-233 is useful in the treatment of N-SCLC of limited extent. They also suggest that therapeutic intervention aimed at modified intracellular pathways might constitute a novel investigative approach to the treatment of cancer.\r"

The etiology of renal artery disease was atherosclerosis in 55 patients, fibrous dysplasia in 6, renal transplant arterial stenosis in 5 and postoperative saphenous vein graft stenosis in 2. A successful clinical outcome, defined as a decrease in blood pressure and/or improvement in renal function, was achieved in 12 patients (26.1 per cent) with atherosclerotic renal artery disease, 3 (75 per cent) with fibrous dysplasia, 2 (100 per cent) with saphenous vein graft stenosis and all 5 with transplant renal arterial stenosis (100 per cent). Improved results were observed in patients with nonostial atherosclerotic lesions compared to ostial lesions. There were 23 complications (33.8 per cent) after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and all but 1 occurred with atherosclerosis. Of these complications 13 (19 per cent) were considered major. Since the beginning of 1983, however, only 3 complications occurred among 32 procedures (9.4 per cent) and only 1 of these was of major significance. When technically feasible, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can provide effective treatment for selected patients with renal artery stenosis.\r"

We describe a patient who presented with 2 episodes of staphylococcal bacteremia associated with a ureteral structure and struvite calculi involving the calices, renal pelvis and proximal ureter of a cadaveric renal allograft. The patient was treated successfully with a combination of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous extraction and balloon dilation of the ureteral stricture. Renal transplant function was not altered postoperatively. In selected cases shock wave lithotripsy can be used as effective adjunctive therapy in a renal allograft harboring stones.\r"

A comprehensive search found 13 reports of controlled trials of intravenous aminophylline therapy in severe, acute asthma. These studies compared aminophylline therapy with treatment with either albuterol (salbutamol), epinephrine, or other bronchodilators. The 13 reports did not agree. Seven reported no difference in spirometric values between aminophylline treatment and the control regimens. Three found aminophylline treatment superior. Three favored the control regimen. The results of the 13 trials were reanalyzed and pooled. Overall, there was no difference between the aminophylline-treated groups and the control groups. Sensitivity analysis suggests that aminophylline therapy is ineffective alone but may be more effective than single-drug therapy when combined with an injected beta-agonist. Despite widespread practice, available trials do not provide adequate evidence to support or reject the use of aminophylline in the treatment of severe, acute asthma.\r"

Like all review methods, meta-analysis can be limited by sampling bias, inadequate data, and biased outcome interpretation. Still, the advantages noted above make meta-analysis a methodology that warrants testing and empirical evaluation.\r"

From age 55 years upward, the continuing increase in cancer mortality is due to epidemic lung cancer. The principal cause of that disease and what must be done to control it are well understood. The objectives for cancer control by the year 2000 set by the National Cancer Institute and the feasibility of reducing cancer mortality by as much as 25% to 50% are also considered.

To evaluate the events, we developed and applied concepts of a five-phase process that can be used to assess the clinical utility of diagnostic marker tests. The review showed that when the DST was introduced into the clinical arena, the initial and final two phases of testing (I, IV, and V) had not been adequately conducted. When these phases of testing were suitably checked many years later, the Phase I studies (exploring basic mechanics of test procedures) showed that dexamethasone had variable bioavailability and that the cortisol assay procedure was unreliable. The Phase IV and V studies (examining test results in groups with suitably broad spectrums of cases and controls) showed that the test did not differentiate depression from most pertinent comorbid conditions. Beyond application to the specific problems of the DST, the proposed five phases of development and evaluation for diagnostic marker tests can be used to plan suitable research and avoid similar problems in the future.\r"

Sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. Although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. We evaluated the management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of catheter. Seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. The catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. The most common microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and Streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group D Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. Thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. Thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. Twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. Lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. These findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of Broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.\r"

Urgent surgical consultation is requested when these features are prominent enough to mimic common acute processes requiring laparotomy. This condition must be included in the differential diagnosis in order to avoid an unnecessary laparotomy in this select group of patients who are usually severely thrombocytopenic and leukopenic. Clinical diagnosis alone is very reliable.\r"

  ".U": "88142088\r", 
  ".W": "In this study we tried to define the possible benefits of the oxygen-derived free radical scavengers after 3 hours of cold myocardial global ischemia, as required in the setting of cardiac transplantation. Twenty-one pig hearts were harvested after preservation with a cold cardioplegic solution (St. Thomas' Hospital solution) and topical cooling. Normothermic reperfusion with blood was achieved with a special heart-lung machine preparation, which allows the heart to beat in a working or nonworking mode. Twelve hearts served as control hearts (group I), and nine (group II) were subjected to superoxide dismutase and catalase. Superoxide dismutase was applied at a dose of 40 U/ml of cardioplegic solution and 1500 U/kg body weight with the start of reperfusion. Catalase was added to the cardioplegic solution in a dose of 100 U/kg and 3500 U/kg body weight with the start of reperfusion. After 15 minutes of retrograde reperfusion, both left ventricular developed pressure and its first derivative were significantly higher in group II (137 +/- 7.6 mm Hg, 2467 +/- 162 mm Hg/sec) than in group I (105 +/- 6 mm Hg, 1676 +/- 231 mm Hg/sec, p less than 0.05 for each). In addition, a considerably higher coronary blood flow was observed in group II throughout the 180-minute period of reperfusion (p = 0.047). We therefore conclude that the combined administration of superoxide dismutase and catalase during the initial period of cardioplegic arrest and during early reperfusion of donor hearts submitted to 3 hours of cold ischemia has a beneficial effect on myocardial performance.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of free radical-induced injury during heart preservation and transplantation, we harvested hearts from 28 mongrel dogs (12.5 to 16.5 kg), divided them into four groups, and orthotopically transplanted them. A group of seven hearts were orthotopically transplanted immediately after excision (group A). A second group of seven animals received allopurinol pretreatment (50 mg/kg/day) for 72 hours, and the hearts were orthotopically transplanted immediately after excision (group B). A third group of seven hearts were transplanted after continuous perfusion with oxygenated modified Collins solutions at 4 degrees C, pH 7.4, and a pressure of 20 mm Hg for 18 hours (group C). A fourth group of seven animals received allopurinol pretreatment (50 mg/kg/day) for 72 hours, and the hearts were orthotopically transplanted after perfusion with modified Collins solutions in the same manner as group C hearts (group D). The generation of free radicals, estimated by measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (malondialdehyde) in the coronary effluent, stayed at low levels during perfusion in groups C and D and also remained at low levels during operational ischemia in group A and B. During reperfusion, their levels abruptly and significantly increased and were associated with a corresponding increase in creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme (malondialdehyde levels at 30 minutes' reperfusion: A, 2.25 +/- 0.43; B, 1.55 +/- 0.25 nmol/ml/100 gm wet weight [p less than 0.05 versus group A]; C, 2.67 +/- 0.28; D, 1.77 +/- 0.27 nmol/ml/100 gm wet weight [p less than 0.05 versus group C]). In the allopurinol pretreatment groups, allopurinol significantly slowed the appearance of malondialdehyde and the release of creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme during reperfusion. Furthermore, cardiac functions during reperfusion, expressed as percent of control (mean +/- standard deviation), were significantly better in the allopurinol pretreatment groups than in the untreated groups: maximum first derivative of left ventricular pressure: A, 76.4 +/- 9.5; B, 99.7 +/- 14.3 [p less than 0.05 versus group A]; C, 25.2 +/- 2.6; D, 42.7 +/- 7.9 [p less than 0.05 versus group C]). These results indicate that (1) the generation of oxygen free radical is not significant during perfusion with modified Collins solutions nor during operational ischemia, but only during reperfusion, and (2) allopurinol reduces free radical-induced injury during reperfusion. Allopurinol has potential application in the prevention of reperfusion injury during heart transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Two immunosuppressive regimens-cyclosporine plus prednisone and azathioprine plus prednisone-were compared in 78 renal transplantation patients (39 in each treatment group) who were successfully managed for more than 15 months. In patients who received cyclosporine, the dosage was adjusted to achieve trough whole blood concentrations of 100 to 250 ng/ml measured by liquid chromatography. A greater number of haplotypes matched in the azathioprine-treated group than in the cyclosporine-treated group (P less than 0.026). Graft survival was similar in patients who received azathioprine (95%) and those given cyclosporine (94%). The azathioprine group had a higher mortality (7%) than the cyclosporine group (2%). In a comparison of the two treatment groups, no statistically significant difference was found in posttransplant renal function, based on either serum creatinine or iothalamate clearance. We conclude that renal toxicity due to cyclosporine can be minimized to statistical nonsignificance by using cyclosporine dosages that provide trough whole blood concentrations in the range of 150 to 250 ng/ml during the first 4 months of therapy and 80 to 200 ng/ml thereafter.\r"

The patient had typical features of Cushing's syndrome and dynamic pituitary-adrenal testing, which suggested an ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome. Results of petrosal sinus catheterization indicated that the pituitary gland was the source of excess ACTH. Total hypophysectomy resulted in complete remission of Cushing's syndrome. Light microscopic and immunohistochemical studies revealed multinodular corticotrope hyperplasia. Plasma corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) was undetectable, and computed tomography of the chest and abdomen disclosed no neoplastic source of CRH. We speculate that either an abnormality in hypothalamic CRH secretion or corticotrope hypersensitivity to CRH might have been responsible for Cushing's syndrome in this patient.\r"

A rational decision can be made when the pathophysiologic features of aortic regurgitation and the natural history of medically treated patients are understood and the benefits and risks associated with aortic valve replacement are known. Proper interpretation of the literature involving echocardiography and nuclear cardiology is essential, as is consideration of the constantly changing surgical techniques and results. Aortic valve replacement should be recommended for those patients with chronic aortic regurgitation who are severely symptomatic (New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV), in order to ameliorate symptoms and increase longevity. In asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients, close continued serial follow-up is necessary in order to detect the onset of resting left ventricular dysfunction and to recommend the optimal timing for surgical intervention.\r"

In the past 10 years, many important advances have been made regarding the management of these disorders. Risk factors have been better defined than in the past. Several new prophylactic measures--such as external pneumatic compression of the lower extremities, dihydroergotamine in combination with heparin, adjusted-dose heparin, and two-step warfarin therapy--can be used to help prevent deep venous thrombosis in surgical patients. The use of serial impedance plethysmography has expanded options for noninvasive diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. Correlations between pulmonary embolism and ventilation-perfusion lung scan patterns have been clarified. Although much has been learned about heparin and warfarin that affect common management decisions, the indications for thrombolytic therapy for venous thromboembolism remain controversial. Finally, studies have shown that calf vein thrombi that are not detectable by impedance plethysmography and that show no evidence of proximal propagation by serial impedance plethysmography do not require treatment.\r"

  ".W": "In February to July, 1986, an outbreak of type 3 poliomyelitis occurred in north-east Brazil that was linked to type-specific failure of trivalent oral polio vaccine (TOPV). To see if alternative vaccines would improve seroconversion to type 3, 441 children less than 5 years of age who had previously received no or up to four doses of TOPV were randomly assigned to receive one dose of standard TOPV (1,000,000, 100,000, and 300,000 median tissue culture infection doses [TCID50] of types 1, 2, and 3, respectively); a new formulation of TOPV containing twice the dosage of type 3 (600,000 TCID50); or a monovalent vaccine containing 300,000 TCID50 of type 3. While rates of seroconversion to types 1 or 2 were equivalent following vaccination with either formulation of TOPV, children who received the new formulation were 2.7 times more likely to seroconvert to type 3. Similar differences for type 3 were observed when monovalent vaccine was compared with standard TOPV, though both groups had received the same dose of type 3 antigen. The low rate of seroconversion to type 3 in the standard TOPV group was associated with a higher rate of reinfection with type 2, which also appeared to interfere to some extent with seroconversion to type 1. These findings extend earlier observations that interference from Sabin type 2 virus may be an important contributory cause of type-specific TOPV failure, and suggest that interference can be overcome with alterations in the formulation.\r"

The basis of the immunosuppression could be molecular mimicries involving viral gp-110, CD4 molecules, antibodies, and CD4-acceptor sites. Whether an individual develops auto-immunosuppressive responses or mounts a harmless defence against (or coexists with) the virus follows the general rules of lymphocyte repertoire selection. MHC and V region genes and other polymorphic loci, together with the previous state of the immune system, particularly at early developmental periods, are factors that influence the response. Vaccination against gp 110-HIV might thus protect against infection but at the same time cause auto-immunosuppression and disease.\r"

Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty was performed in 98 patients.

There were 37 (37.7%) good, 33 (33.6%) moderate, and 28 (28.5%) poor responders in this group. Twenty-four patients underwent tracheostomy. Eighteen (75%) patients continue to have their tracheostomies without complications (mean follow-up time 32 months). One hundred thirty-eight patients were evaluated with CPAP. Of the 100 patients who began home CPAP use, 53 continue to use CPAP successfully at 18 months. Medical treatment (tricyclic antidepressants) was used in 35 patients. The response to this modality was generally poor. Six patients were fitted with TRD. The compliance to this device was poor, although two have had significant improvement in their apnea. An orthodontic appliance was used in two patients with one responding successfully.\r"

Eligibility required disease onset to be before age 16, and an endoscopic excision requirement of at least three operations in the 6 months immediately prior to entry. Patients were randomized to Observation versus WFN at a dose of 5 MU/m2 daily for 28 days and three times weekly for 5 months. The patient groups were comparable in extent of disease at entry. Total extent of disease was determined by a composite score derived from the number of diseased anatomic sites and extent of surface area and lumen encroachment present at each site. Standard endoscopic excisions were performed every 2 months and clinical courses compared on a basis of composite scores determined at each endoscopy. Statistically significant improvement occurred in the patient group which received WFN. We conclude that interferon alpha n-1 is an effective adjuvant to surgery in RRP management.\r"

  ".U": "88143002\r", 
  ".W": "With the dramatic increase in the frequency of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection, there has been a need for more rapid and less invasive diagnostic techniques. Recent studies have shown that examination of induced sputum can establish the diagnosis of P. carinii pneumonia in about 55 percent of cases. To assess whether a recently developed indirect immunofluorescent stain using monoclonal antibodies was more sensitive than Giemsa or toluidine blue O stains in detecting P. carinii in sputum, we undertook two prospective studies. Of 63 patients at one institution from whom sputum specimens were obtained, 49 were ultimately given a diagnosis of P. carinii pneumonia, 46 of them by staining of sputum. The sensitivity of the three stains in detecting P. carinii was 45 of 49 (92 percent) for immunofluorescence; 37 of 49 (76 percent) for Diff-Quik (a Giemsa-type stain); and 39 of 49 (80 percent) for toluidine blue O. There were no false positive immunofluorescent stains. In a similar study of a series of 25 patients at another institution, a diagnosis of P. carinii pneumonia was made in 23 of 25 patients by staining of induced sputum. We conclude that examination of induced sputum is a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive method for diagnosing P. carinii pneumonia and that indirect immunofluorescence is a practical and highly sensitive staining technique for establishing this diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "To test our previous observation that methotrexate reduces corticosteroid requirements of patients with severe asthma, we studied 14 patients with corticosteroid-dependent bronchial asthma in a 24-week randomized double-blind crossover trial comparing a low dosage of methotrexate (15 mg per week) with placebo. At base line the mean dosage of prednisone was 173.5 mg per week (range, 70 to 420). On the average, 36.5 percent less prednisone was required when patients received methotrexate than when they received placebo (P = 0.01). Measurement of forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second showed that there was no deterioration in the condition of patients in whom the dosage of prednisone was reduced. The patients' subjective assessment of breathing ability indicated significant improvement (P = 0.01). The adverse effects of methotrexate were limited to transient nausea in three patients and an evanescent rash in one patient. Nine patients are still receiving methotrexate 3 to 10 months after the study's conclusion. The dosages of steroids have been further reduced in each of these patients, and prednisone has been discontinued in four. We conclude from this preliminary study that the use of methotrexate allows a significant reduction in the use of corticosteroids in patients with severe asthma without deterioration of pulmonary function.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the use of silver nitrate drops and tetracycline ointment for the prophylaxis of ophthalmia neonatorum in a controlled trial involving 2732 newborns in Nairobi, Kenya. The overall rates of prevalence of intrapartum maternal gonococcal and chlamydial infection were 6.4 and 8.9 percent, respectively. After prophylaxis with silver nitrate, the incidence rates of gonococcal, chlamydial, and nongonococcal, nonchlamydial ophthalmia neonatorum were 0.4, 0.7, and 6.2 percent, respectively, whereas after prophylaxis with tetracycline, the rates were 0.1, 0.5, and 4.5 percent. The attack rates of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum in newborns exposed to Neisseria gonorrhoeae at birth were 7.0 percent in those receiving silver nitrate and 3.0 percent in those receiving tetracycline (95 percent confidence interval for the difference in rates, -3.4 to 11.4 percent). As compared with historical controls, the incidence of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum decreased 83 percent among infants treated with silver nitrate and 93 percent among those treated with tetracycline. Failure of prophylaxis was associated with postpartum maternal endometritis (P = 0.05). Among newborns exposed to maternal infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, chlamydial conjunctivitis developed in 10.1 percent given silver nitrate and in 7.2 percent given tetracycline (95 percent confidence interval for the difference in rates, -4.7 to 10.5 percent), yielding reductions in the incidence of chlamydial ophthalmia of 68 and 77 percent, respectively, as compared with the historical controls. We conclude that tetracycline is as effective as silver nitrate in preventing gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.\r"

  ".W": "During 100 autopsies of patients who had no previous endocrinological problem, selective injections of the pituitary arterial systems were performed. Pituitary glands were examined from 60 male and 40 female patients with an average age of 68 years. Detailed histological and immunocytological studies using peroxidase-antiperoxidase techniques for prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticocotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and growth hormone were used. Thirty-three microadenomas were found in 27 patients; 22 were single, 4 were double, and 1 was triple. Fourteen were nonreactive to immunostaining, 10 were reactive to PRL, and 9 were reactive to ACTH. Their diameters ranged between 0.5 and 5.0 mm, and they were located mainly in the lateral wings and the peripheral zone of the anterior pituitary gland. Microvascular study revealed that 22 microadenomas (66%) had direct extraportal arterial supplies. Because the hypothalamic factors are transported to the anterior lobe through the portal vessels, this study suggests that the formation of microadenomas occurs most frequently outside the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system and further supports the hypothesis that pituitary adenomas may arise de novo without the influence of hypothalamic factors.\r"

The salient clinical features of this syndrome are described, with emphasis on the peculiar pattern of motor weakness and the physiology of painful symptoms. Diagnostic methods are critiqued. The various surgical approaches for this syndrome are evaluated according to their facility for wide exposure, their potential morbidity, and their beneficial results.\r"

Computed tomographic (CT) scans suggest the diagnosis by showing a posterior fossa lesion, iso- and hypodense, partially calcified, and not enhanced by contrast medium. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) seems to define limits of the lesion better than CT scanning and could improve the surgical approach. Surgical excision of the lesion is the only satisfactory treatment. The postoperative prognosis is usually favorable.\r"

  ".U": "88143352\r", 
  ".W": "To determine whether cerebral arteries in spasm have an altered capacity to synthesize the vasoactive substances prostacyclin and thromboxane A2, we measured levels of these arachidonic acid metabolites using a primate model of vasospasm. Twenty-four cynomolgus monkeys were assigned at random to one of three groups designated sham, clot, or clot-removal. All animals underwent base line cerebral angiography and bilateral dissection of the major cerebral arteries from the arachnoid. The clot and clot-removal groups had autologous hematomas placed around the vessels to simulate subarachnoid hemorrhages. The sham group had a similar volume of saline instilled into the subarachnoid space. Twenty-four hours later, the clot-removal group underwent a second craniotomy to remove the hematomas. Seven days after the initial operation, angiography was repeated on all animals. The animals were then killed, and the cerebral arteries were removed. Basal levels of prostacyclin and thromboxane in the cerebral vessels were measured after incubation in vitro by radioimmunoassay. No detectable leukotriene C4 release by these arteries was measurable using radioimmunoassay. Angiography revealed severe cerebral vasospasm in the clot group, but not in the clot-removal or sham groups. There were no statistical differences among the groups in thromboxane release, but prostacyclin levels were significantly lower in the clot group than in the clot-removal group (P less than 0.05). It thus seems that, if an imbalance in constrictor and dilator eicosanoids occurs in association with vasospasm, this is more likely to arise from a relative lack of the vasodilator component prostacyclin than from a surplus of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nine of 10 patients who were neurologically normal preoperatively were normal postoperatively, and the other had transient upper extremity weakness after resection of a lesion in the contralateral motor strip. The 1-year survival in this group of patients was 62.5%. No local recurrence was noted in any patient. Computer-assisted stereotactic resection permits accurate localization of metastatic lesions and gross total resection from difficult locations with acceptable levels of morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "To delineate the immunoarchitecture of the normal human lacrimal gland, monoclonal antibodies that detect B- and T-lymphocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell lineage, subset, and differentiation-associated antigens were used in combination with highly sensitive tissue-section immunoperoxidase techniques. Plasma cells, identified with monoclonal antibody OKT10, represented the predominant mononuclear cell population, accounting for 53.9% of all mononuclear cells present. A qualitative study of plasma cell cytoplasmic immunoglobulin heavy-chain expression in deparaffinized, formalin-fixed tissue sections showed that the vast majority of these plasma cells contained IgA. Rare plasma cells contained IgG, IgM, or IgD. T-cells, identified with monoclonal antibody OKT3, represented the second most common cell type in the normal human lacrimal gland, accounting for 40.3% of all mononuclear cells present. T cells were located predominantly in lymphocytic foci and singly in the interstitium. T8 antigen-positive (suppressor/cytotoxic) T cells predominated over T4 antigen-positive (helper) T cells, averaging 25.2 and 14.7%, respectively. The overall mean T4/T8 ratio was 0.56. T8 antigen-positive T cells were the most numerous cell population outside aggregates and follicles, being distributed almost equally between the acini and the ducts (49%) and the interstitium (51%). Only 16% of T4 antigen-positive cells preferred glands or ducts to the interstitium. B cells, identified with monoclonal antibody BL9, represented only 5.7% of all mononuclear cells present. B cells were exclusively found in the centers of primary and secondary follicles. The majority of the surface immunoglobulin-positive B cells expressed IgM, fewer expressed IgD, and still fewer expressed IgG or IgA. Rare LeuM1+ OKM1+ macrophages were present in the center of B-cell follicles, where rare OKT6+ dendritic cells and activated T cells (IL-2+) were also discovered. These results support the concept that the lacrimal gland belongs to the mucosa-associated lymphoid system.\r"

In three cases, persistent fistulas of the limbal sclera were excised with a trephine, and a peripheral graft using corneal donor tissue was used to seal the circular defect. This resulted in permanent wound closure and provided a tissue diagnosis of epithelial downgrowth (2 cases) and chronic scleral necrosis (1 case).\r"

In addition to the morphologically granular deposits, numerous fusiform deposits identified as amyloid by histochemistry and electron microscopy and morphologically identical to those seen in lattice corneal dystrophy were detected deep to the granular deposits. It was further shown that the histochemical pattern of staining of the granular material by a series of lectins was similar to that present in corneas with lattice dystrophy.

Results of histochemical studies showed that the M-G bodies stained positively for calcium, iron, and mucopolysaccharides. Results of electron microscopic studies showed that the histiocytes contained numerous membrane-bound lysosomal bodies of variable size and density. Some histiocytes demonstrated coccobacilli, some of which were degenerated and incorporated into large phagolysosomes. The latter provided the nidus for the deposition of inorganic elements (calcium and iron) and mucopolysaccharides to form the M-G bodies which displayed concentric calcific rings with radiating spicules of hydroxyapatite crystals. The pathogenesis of malakoplakia is discussed. The case reported herein represents the third one involving the ocular adnexa.

Upon comparing the preoperatively determined refractive goal with that actually obtained, an \"ideal\" IOL power which would have resulted in the refractive goal was determined. The IOL power selected by the regression formula was within 2 diopters (D) of the ideal IOL power in 67% (35/52) of the cases. For comparison, the power which would have been selected if the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK) or Binkhorst formula was used would have been within 2 D of the ideal IOL power in 62% (SRK, 32/52) and 58% (Binkhorst, 30/52) of the cases. Deviations from the ideal IOL power were predominantly in the undercorrected category for all three formulas evaluated. The authors conclude that even though a surgeon-specific regression formula relying on preoperative axial length performed fully as well as either the SRK or Binkhorst formulas, the choice of which formula to apply remains in the surgeon's hands.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of suspected benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma) of the lacrimal gland consists of wide local surgical excision of the tumor and its capsule in their entirety. The tumor should be approached routinely via a lateral orbitotomy to provide maximal exposure and allow complete removal of the lesion. However, if clinical and radiographic evidence indicates a far anterior location implying an origin in the more superficial palpebral lobe, an anterior transcutaneous approach is advantageous and preferred. The authors report an adult case of an anteriorly located benign mixed tumor of the palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland. The authors reviewed the characteristic clinical, echographic, and computed tomographic (CT) features, offered a differential diagnosis, and described surgical removal using a cryoprobe via an anterior lid approach. An awareness of the distinctive clinical and diagnostic features of benign mixed tumor of the palpebral lobe should help to avoid the complications that ensue from an incisional biopsy or piecemeal resection through the lid, and also to avoid the need for more extensive surgery for removal of residual or recurrent tumor.\r"

The purpose of this article is to review the pathophysiology of hemophilic arthropathy and its management. A case of temporomandibular joint hemophilic arthropathy in a patient with a factor XI deficiency will be presented. A brief review of factor XI deficiency and a hypothetical pathophysiological mechanism for internal derangement induced by myofascial pain dysfunction are included.\r"

The median mandibular cyst does not appear to exist as an entity. All cysts reported as such are probably odontogenic. In previous reports on median mandibular cysts, undue emphasis has been placed on the \"vitality\" of adjacent teeth, as determined by thermal or electrical pulp testing. These tests are not completely reliable. Mucous cells and cilia can be found in odontogenic cysts, and consequently their presence in lesions reported as median mandibular cysts does not preclude these cysts from being odontogenic.\r"

HSV was more common in patients with than without graft vs. host disease (GVHD) (9 of 30; 30% vs. 10 of 66; 15%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Late or prolonged isolation of HSV occurred in patients with chronic GVHD. Cytomegalovirus was significantly more common in patients with than without GVHD (10 of 30; 33% vs. 7 of 66; 11%). The presence of pretransplant antibody to cytomegalovirus or HSV was a good predictor of subsequent infection. Adenoviruses were isolated from all 3 patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. Adenovirus type 12, a serotype uncommon in man and known to be highly tumorigenic in young hamsters, was recovered from 4 patients. Adenoviruses were not notably more common in patients with GVHD (6 of 30; 20% vs. 11 of 66; 17%).

Data from the 1980 National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey were used, and differences in use, charges, and out-of-pocket expenses for children with and without limitations in their activities due to chronic health problems are described. The results indicate that children limited in their activities used more medical services than other children, especially hospital-based services and services provided by health professionals other than physicians. Charges and out-of-pocket expenses were two to three times higher on average for disabled children, compared with other children. Charges and out-of-pocket expenses were also skewed; 10% of the sample children accounted for more than 60% of total charges and out-of-pocket expenses for the disabled population. The skewed distribution of out-of-pocket expenses suggests that financial burdens are unevenly shared by families of disabled children. Several public policy options designed to result in a more equitable distribution of financial risks are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Urinary concentrations of beta 2-microglobulin and creatinine were measured serially in 140 sick infants, of whom 109 were asphyxiated, and in 35 healthy preterm and term infants. First voided urines and samples from days 3 and 7 postpartum were studied. Urinary beta 2-microglobulin concentrations in healthy infants averaged 1.34 +/- 1.34 mg/L (mean +/- SD) in first voided specimens and 1.32 +/- 0.98 mg/L in day 3 samples; the calculated upper limit of normal (95% confidence limit) was 4.00 mg/L. Elevated values (those exceeding the 95% confidence limit) occurred most often in the sick asphyxiated patients (56%); the first voided sample value in these patients was 10.0 +/- 10.4 mg/L. The equivalent value in the sick nonasphyxiated infants was 8.32 +/- 7.27 mg/L. Values were significantly and persistently elevated in the sick infants on days 3 and 7. Factoring beta 2-microglobulin levels by urinary creatinine concentration did not affect the significance of the findings. The increased urinary beta 2-microglobulin levels were not (1) related to gestational age; low beta 2-microglobulin values occurred at all gestational ages for both healthy and sick infants; (2) a consequence of urine flow rate; urinary beta 2-microglobulin did not correlate with urinary creatinine concentration or with urine to plasma creatinine ratio; and (3) a consequence of increased production of beta 2-microglobulin; urinary and serum beta 2-microglobulin values did not correlate (r = .03). Thus, we propose that the elevated levels of urinary beta 2-microglobulin in the sick infants were the consequence of tubular injury. This was associated with hematuria but not with a high incidence of azotemia or oliguria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The mRNA of bacteriophage T4 contains a strikingly abundant intercistronic hairpin. Within the 55 kilobases of known T4 sequence, the hexanucleotide sequence CTTCGG is found 13 times in the DNA strand equivalent to mRNA sequences. In 12 of those occurrences, the sequence is flanked by inverted repeats predictive of RNA hairpins with UUCG in the loop. Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, which can traverse hairpins of larger calculated stability, terminates efficiently at these CUUCGG hairpins. Thermal denaturation studies of model hairpins show that the loop sequence UUCG dramatically stabilizes RNA hairpins when compared to a control sequence. These data, when combined with previously described parameters of helix stability, suggest that T4 has utilized this loop sequence to optimize the stability of intercistronic hairpins. The stability of CUUCGG hairpins is also utilized in the RNAs of many organisms besides T4.\r"

  ".W": "A cDNA library from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, constructed in the phage expression vector lambda gt11, was probed with antiserum directed against the nuclear-encoded gamma subunit of the chloroplast H+-transporting ATP synthase [ATP phosphohydrolase (H+-transporting) or chloroplast coupling factors 0 and 1, EC 3.6.1.34] of C. reinhardtii. A cDNA was isolated and transcribed in vitro. The transcript was translated in vitro and immunoprecipitated with anti-gamma-subunit serum to yield a product that coelectrophoresed with the immunoprecipitated product from in vitro-translated polyadenylylated RNA. These proteins were larger than the mature gamma subunit, either immunoprecipitated as chloroplast coupling factor 1 or as the individual subunit. Thus, the gamma subunit is synthesized as a precursor of greater molecular weight in C. reinhardtii. Furthermore, the precursor protein encoded by the cDNA is imported into pea chloroplasts and processed to a lower molecular weight polypeptide that coelectrophoreses with mature C. reinhardtii gamma subunit. The largest cDNA isolated is about the same length as the corresponding mRNA (approximately equal to 1900 bases long) and probably contains the entire coding region. Southern blot analyses revealed restriction fragment length polymorphisms and that the gamma subunit is probably encoded by an intron-containing single-copy gene.\r"

  ".W": "During tRNA biosynthesis the 5'-leader sequences in precursor tRNAs are removed by the ribonucleoprotein RNase P, an enzyme whose RNA moiety is required for activity. To clarify some aspects of the enzyme mechanism, we examined substrate binding and product formation with mutant precursor tRNAs. Mutations G-1----A or U-2----C in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe sup3-e tRNASer, which cause mispairing at or near the top of the acceptor stem, prevent the removal of the 5'-leader sequences by Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase P. Equilibrium binding studies involving specific gel retardation of RNase P-precursor tRNA complexes showed that complexes with wild-type and A-1 and C-2 mutant precursor tRNAs had very similar dissociation constants (average Kd for sup3 = 1.5 +/- 0.2 nM). Thus, the 5'-terminal nucleotides of mature tRNA, on the 3' proximal side of the RNase P cleavage site, affect the enzyme's catalytic function but not substrate binding. The catalytic integrity of the RNA component of RNase P is not essential for binding of tRNA precursors, as demonstrated by gel retardation of micrococcal nuclease-inactivated enzyme. This suggests a possible role for the protein component of the enzyme in substrate binding. Upon restoration of base pairing to the acceptor stem in the A-1 or C-2 mutants, we found that, in addition to a requirement for pairing at these positions, conservation of the wild-type first and second nucleotides of the tRNA was necessary to obtain maximal cleavage by RNase P. This indicates a distinct sequence preference of this enzyme.\r"

Three proteins appear to be required for receptor-mediated control of swimming behavior, the products of the cheA, cheW, and cheY genes. Here we present the complete nucleotide sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium cheA gene together with the purification and characterization of its protein product. The protein is a 73,000 Mr cytoplasmic constituent. Amino acid-sequence comparisons indicate that it belongs to a family of bacterial regulatory proteins including the products of the cpxA, dctB, envZ, ntrB, phoR, phoM, and virA genes. Each member of this family has a conserved domain of approximately equal to 200 residues within its C terminus. We have previously shown that another chemotaxis protein, CheY, represents a domain of protein structure that has been conserved within a second large family of bacterial regulatory proteins. Each protein of the CheA family seems to function as a regulator of a different CheY homologue. Although each pair of proteins appears to produce a specialized response to a distinct type of stimulus, the relationships in primary structure suggest that a similar molecular mechanism may be involved.\r"

When dsI is activated by low levels of dsRNA, it is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. The transient expression of dsI is due to an autocrine effect of interferon at specific stages of growth and differentiation, and it may represent a mechanism for regulating cell growth and differentiation in 3T3-F442A cells. In this report, the purification of dsI from 3T3-F442A cell cultures by a two-step procedure is described. A specific immune serum to dsI was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with highly pure preparations. Immune precipitation studies demonstrate that the serum reacts with phosphorylated dsI both in vitro and in vivo and with de novo synthesized dsI after induction with interferon. We find that dsI of 3T3 cells can undergo phosphorylation in vitro without the addition of dsRNA and in vivo in the absence of viral infection. These results are consistent with a physiologic role for dsI in the growth and differentiation of these cells.\r"

It is proposed that the native alpha 2-macroglobulin consists of the juxtaposition of two protomers with one protomer shaped like a distorted letter \"S\" and with the other its reverse image, to form a binding site between the two protomers near the bottom of the complex. On cleavage of the subunits with chymotrypsin, the native structure condenses to 16.7 nm and rearranges so that the interaction between the protomers is near the middle. Two images of the alpha 2-macroglobulin-chymotrypsin conjugate were obtained. We suggest that these images represent the end and side view of this complex. Based on the manner in which the native structure is assembled, we propose that the proteolyzed form of alpha 2-macroglobulin is functionally asymmetric in that both protease binding sites reside on the same half of the complex.\r"

There are approximately equal to 10 copies of the sequence dispersed among the chromosome-sized DNA molecules resolved by pulsed-field electrophoresis. New DNA polymorphisms in this gene family arise at high rates. As a consequence, this probe will readily distinguish strains from different patients in the same hospital and from various sites in individual patients. The DNA polymorphisms detected by using this probe are largely due to internal changes in members of the family rather than movement to new genomic locations. This suggests recombination or gene conversion rather than transposition as the mechanism producing the observed variation.\r"

R. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 2071-2076]. By using restriction fragments of lacY genes harboring specific site-directed mutations, a fusion gene has been constructed that encodes a permease in which His-35 and His-39 are replaced with arginine, and His-205 with glutamine (RQHE permease). The resultant molecule contains a single histidine residue at position 322 and exhibits all of the properties of the wild-type permease. In addition, an analogous single-histidine permease was engineered with alanine at position 325 in place of glutamic acid (RQHA permease). This construct is defective in active transport but catalyzes exchange and counterflow normally. RQHA permease, like the single-histidine permease with Glu-325, also shows normal behavior with respect to N-ethylmaleimide inactivation, substrate protection, and binding. In addition to providing strong support for previous experiments, the engineered permease molecules should be useful for determining the apparent pK of His-322 under various conditions.\r"

The substitution of a serine or alanine residue at position 146 did not appreciably alter the binding affinity for 2'-deoxyuridylate but the serine mutant enzyme was less active by a factor of 5000, whereas the alanine mutant enzyme was catalytically inactive. In contrast, the substitution of a glycine or threonine at position 146 created inactive enzymes with higher 2'-deoxyuridylate dissociation constants. The dissociation constant values for 2'-deoxyuridylate were used to estimate the overall contribution of the side chain of the amino acid at position 146 to substrate binding. The results suggested that the side chains of cysteine, alanine, and serine make nonspecific but effective van der Waals contacts with 2'-deoxyuridylate, thereby contributing about 0.82 kcal.mol-1 (1 cal = 4.184 J) to the apparent binding energy of the substrate.\r"

This property raises the possibility that SMC-derived PDGFs function as autocrine/paracrine regulators in the formation and maintenance of the artery wall. In this study we have asked if levels of mRNAs directing synthesis of PDGF are modulated in aortic SMC during postnatal development. We report here that genes encoding PDGF A- and B-chain precursors are expressed at similar low levels in intact aortas from newborn and adult rats. Marked differences in regulation of transcript abundance of these genes were revealed when aortic SMC were grown in cell culture. PDGF B-chain transcripts accumulated in passaged newborn rat SMC but not adult rat SMC, whereas PDGF A-chain RNA was found in comparable amounts in SMC from both age groups. Similarly, SMC from newborn rats secreted at least 60-fold more PDGF-like activity into conditioned medium than did adult rat SMC. PDGF B-chain transcripts in newborn rat aortic SMC are short-lived and increased 5-fold by 3 hr after treatment with cycloheximide. In contrast, PDGF A-chain transcripts are more stable, and their constitutive levels were generally unaffected by cycloheximide. These results show that PDGF A- and B-chain genes are transcribed in the normal rat aorta and provide evidence for age-related change in the control of PDGF B-chain gene expression in aortic SMC. Independent regulation of transcript levels in cultured SMC leaves open the possibility that PDGFs of different composition (AA, AB, BB) play different roles in normal function of the artery wall.\r"

After confluent cell monolayers were coated with alternate layers of cationized colloidal silica and a polyanion, 60% of the apical surface was recovered as large membrane sheets through the application of a polylysine-coated glass surface. Scanning electron microscopy of the cytoplasmic aspect of the apical surface revealed a honeycomb pattern given by the cell borders fractured at or above the level of the tight junctions. By transmission electron microscopy, the apical preparation appeared to be composed of plasma membrane and a thin layer of cytoplasm. Enzyme assays and immunoblots demonstrated a 6- to 7-fold enrichment of an apical marker and a low level of contamination by cytoplasmic and basolateral markers. After removal of cytosolic contaminants and peripheral membrane proteins by alkaline extraction, apical integral membrane proteins were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (NaDodSO4/PAGE). Lectin blotting and [3H]glucosamine labeling identified two major sialoglycoproteins of apparent Mr 200,000 and 100,000. The apical membrane sheets here described provide a useful model for systematic characterization of the molecular components of the membrane, for reconstitution of lipid and protein transport in cell-free systems, and for study of the interactions of submembranous cytoskeletal proteins with the apical plasma membrane domain.\r"

The 65-kDa and 80-kDa polypeptides were shown to be immunologically distinct from laminin, type IV collagen, fibronectin, and major serum proteins. They presumably represent a novel basement membrane-associated protein, which we have named merosin. No merosin immunoreactivity could be detected in cultures of any of 28 established cell lines. In developing mouse tissues, merosin staining first appeared at the newborn stage. The restricted tissue distribution and late developmental appearance of merosin suggest that the protein has a tissue-specific function associated with a high level of differentiation.\r"

We devised a genetic screen to distinguish between cells containing only membrane-bound AP and those containing soluble AP. The screen depends on diffusion of soluble AP away from cells with a leaky outer membrane to produce a halo of AP activity around colonies on solid growth medium. Several mutants lacking this halo show reduced degradation of Tsr-AP 2. One mutant is also defective in breakdown of five other abnormal periplasmic proteins but not of two cytoplasmic proteins. The mutation in this strain, degP4::Tn5, defines a locus distinct from previously identified loci that affect protein stability or protease activities.

The nucleotide sequence of the gene conferring tetracycline resistance was modified by conservative codon replacement so as to accommodate the sequence d(CCTTCGCTAC) flanked by two restriction sites, Bsm I and Xho I. The corresponding synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide underwent reaction with 2-(N-acetoxy-N-acetylamino)-fluorene (AAAF), forming a single dG-AAF adduct. This modified oligodeoxynucleotide was hybridized to its complementary strand and ligated between the Bsm I and Xho I sites of the vector. Plasmids containing the C8-dG-AAF adduct were used to transfect simian virus 40-transformed simian kidney (COS-1) cells and to transform several AB strains of Escherichia coli. Colonies containing mutant plasmids were detected by hybridization to 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides. Presence of the single DNA adduct increased the mutation frequency by 8-fold in both COS cells and E. coli. Over 80% of mutations detected in both systems were targeted and represented G.C----C.G or G.C----T.A transversions or single nucleotide deletions. We conclude that modification of a deoxyguanosine residue with AAF preferentially induces mutations targeted at this site when a plasmid containing a single C8-dG-AAF adduct is introduced into mammalian cells or bacteria.\r"

  ".U": "88144484\r", 
  ".W": "It is known that the production of cytolytic T lymphocytes requires growth factors such as interleukins 2 and 4 (IL-2 and IL-4). Elsewhere we have described bioassays that detect a cytokine that operates in concert with growth factor to generate cytolytic T lymphocytes. The factor that is termed cytolytic T-lymphocyte differentiation factor (CDF), together with IL-2 and lectin, mediates the formation of CD8+ killer cells in 2 days from thymocyte or peripheral lymphoid precursors. CDF is not mimicked by natural or recombinant sources of interferons, colony-stimulating factors, and IL-1 to IL-4. Here we use these bioassays to isolate and further characterize a single 24-kDa CDF protein from the conditioned medium of stimulated human blood mononuclear cells. CDF is first enriched by three successive chromatographic procedures that utilize anion exchange, hydroxyapatite, and phenyl-Superose. A single 24-kDa band with CDF activity is then isolated on 12% NaDodSO4/PAGE and clearly distinguished from the 17-kDa band of IL-2. The apparent molecular mass is similar under reducing and nonreducing conditions. After elution from NaDodSO4/PAGE the cytokine is maximally active at 0.25 nM in the CDF assay and has no growth factor activity for T lymphoblasts. To generate cytolytic CD8+, CD4- cells from spleen and lymph node T lymphocytes, IL-2 and small numbers of accessory dendritic cells must be applied together with CDF.\r"

Fifty-two presentation AML DNAs were screened for mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 of NRAS and in codons 12 and 61 of KRAS and HRAS. Fourteen (27%) contained mutations--all in NRAS and predominantly in codon 12. The most common amino acid substitution identified was of glycine by aspartic acid at codon 12 (7/18), with a G----A transition being the most common base change (11/18). No particular correlation was observed between disease subtype and the incidence or type of NRAS mutation. In DNA samples from four patients, 2 NRAS mutations were found to coexist. NIH 3T3 focus-formation assays revealed that in each case the mutations were present in different NRAS alleles. We also report the absence of a mutated RAS gene in relapse DNAs of four patients in which a RAS oncogene had been detected at presentation. These observations suggest that RAS mutations arise as part of the evolution of neoplastic transformation.\r"

  ".W": "To eliminate the undesirable edematogenic effect of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) antagonists containing basic D amino acids at position 6, exemplified by [Ac-D-Phe(pCl)1,2,D-Trp3,D-Arg6,D-Ala10]LH-RH [Phe(pCl) indicates 4-chlorophenylalanine], analogs with D-ureidoalkyl amino acids such as D-citrulline (D-Cit) or D-homocitrulline (D-Hci) at position 6 were synthesized and tested in several systems in vitro and in vivo. HPLC analysis revealed that the overall hydrophobicity of the D-Cit/D-Hci6 analogs was similar to that of the basic D-Arg6 antagonists. In vitro, most of the analogs completely inhibited LH-RH-mediated luteinizing hormone release in perfused rat pituitary cell systems at an antagonist to LH-RH molar ratio of 5:1. In vivo, the most active peptides, [Ac-D-Nal(2)1,D-Phe(pCl)2,D-Trp3,D-Cit6,D-Ala10]LH-RH [Nal(2) indicates 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine] and its D-Hci6 analog, caused 100% inhibition of ovulation in cycling rats in doses of 3 micrograms and suppressed the luteinizing hormone level in ovariectomized female rats for 47 hr when administered at doses of 25 micrograms. Characteristically, these peptides did not exert any edematogenic effects even at 1.5 mg/kg. These properties of the D-Cit/D-Hci6 antagonists may make them useful clinically.\r"

  ".W": "A protein of 75 kDa is produced in large quantities by the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum and is present on the surface of the merozoite, whose function is to infect erythrocytes. Based on nucleotide sequence coding for 40% of this protein, two nonoverlapping model peptides 13 and 19 residues long were synthesized, coupled to a keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier, and used to immunize rabbits. Although both antisera had high titers of anti-peptide antibodies, only that raised against the 13-residue peptide showed good reactivity against the original protein. Although the 19-mer adopted the helical secondary structure predicted for the corresponding protein region, antisera against this peptide reacted with the native protein weakly or not at all. Concluding that the poor anti-protein reactivity was due to modification of lysine-containing epitopes by glutaraldehyde conjugation, we used a carrier-free 28-residue peptide presented as a 56-residue disulfide-bonded dimer to model the same region. This peptide, in contrast to the conjugated 19-mer, stimulated the production of IgG antibodies that reacted at high dilution with the authentic protein in immunoblots, ELISA, and radioimmunoprecipitation assays. These data indicate that large carrier-free peptides may be successfully used as immunogens. In addition, our results show that this strategy may greatly improve the ability of conjugation-sensitive peptides to stimulate antibodies reactive with the original protein and therefore has substantial practical application.\r"

However, the nature of the relationship between NFT and NP and the source of the amyloid beta proteins found in each have remained unclear. We used in situ hybridization techniques to map the anatomical distribution of precursor amyloid-beta-protein mRNA in the neocortex of brains from three subjects with no known neurologic disease and from five patients with Alzheimer disease. In brains from control subjects, positively hybridizing neurons were present in cortical regions and layers that contain a high density of neuropathological markers in Alzheimer disease, as well as in those loci that contain NP but few NFT. Quantitative analyses of in situ hybridization patterns within layers III and V of the superior frontal cortex revealed that the presence of high numbers of NFT in Alzheimer-diseased brains was associated with a decrease in the number of positively hybridizing neurons compared to controls and Alzheimer-diseased brains with few NFT. In contrast, no correlation was found between the densities of NP and neurons containing precursor amyloid-beta-protein mRNA transcripts. These findings suggest that the expression of precursor amyloid-beta-protein mRNA may be a necessary but is clearly not a sufficient prerequisite for NFT formation. In addition, these results may indicate that the amyloid beta protein, present in NP in a given region or layer of cortex, is not derived from the resident neuronal cell bodies that express the mRNA for the precursor protein.\r"

All of the antisera immunoprecipitated the envelope glycoprotein. In particular, an antiserum directed against amino acids 254 to 274 of env was efficient in neutralizing three different isolates of HIV in vitro, without affecting the binding of the virus to CD4-positive cells. Therefore, this conserved region of gp120 appears to be critical in a postbinding event during virus penetration and may represent a target for antibody neutralization of HIV. These findings may be applicable in the design of a vaccine for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

As in most lysosomal storage diseases, neurological deterioration is a prominent feature of the disease in these mice. Transplantation of enzymatically normal congenic bone marrow was earlier found to result in prolonged survival and increased levels of galactosylceramidase in the visceral organs of twitcher mice. It is now reported that bone marrow transplantation results in increased galactosylceramidase levels in the central nervous system (CNS). Concomitantly, the levels of psychosine, a highly toxic lipid that progressively accumulates in the CNS of untreated twitcher mice, stabilized at much lower levels in the CNS of treated twitcher mice. Histologically, a gradual disappearance of globoid cells, the histological hallmark of Krabbe's disease, and the appearance of foamy macrophages capable of metabolizing the storage product were seen in the CNS. By immunohistochemical labeling it was demonstrated that these foamy macrophages were of donor origin. The infiltration of enzymatically competent, donor-derived macrophages was accompanied by extensive remyelination in the CNS. It is concluded that after bone marrow transplantation, donor-derived macrophages infiltrate the affected brain tissue and are capable of inducing a partial reversal of the enzyme deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "A spatial-temporal model of calcium messenger function is proposed to account for sustained cellular responses to sustained stimuli, as well as for the persistent enhancement of cell responsiveness after removal of a stimulus, that is, cellular memory. According to this model, spatial separation of calcium function contributes to temporal separation of distinct phases of the cellular response. At different cellular sites, within successive temporal domains, the calcium messenger is generated by different mechanisms and has distinct molecular targets. In particular, prolonged cell activation is brought about by the interaction of calcium with another spatially confined messenger, diacylglycerol, to cause the association of protein kinase C with the plasma membrane. Activity of the membrane-associated protein kinase C is controlled by the rate of calcium cycling across the plasma membrane. In some instances, a single stimulus induces both protein kinase C activation and calcium cycling and thus causes prolonged activation; but in others, a close temporal association of distinct stimuli brings about cell activation via interaction of these intracellular messengers. Persistent enhancement of cell responsiveness after removal of stimuli is suggested to be due to the continued association, or anchoring, of protein kinase C to the membrane.\r"

It is essential for de novo synthesis of purines and of deoxythymidine monophosphate for DNA synthesis. Among viruses, however, only the T-even and T5 bacteriophage have been found to encode their own DHFR. In this study a gene for DHFR was found in a specific subgroup of the gamma or lymphotropic class of herpesviruses. DNA sequences for DHFR were found in herpesvirus saimiri and herpesvirus ateles but not in Epstein-Barr virus, Marek's disease virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, herpesvirus tamarinus, or human cytomegalovirus. The predicted sequence of herpesvirus saimiri DHFR is 186 amino acids in length, the same length as human, murine, and bovine DHFR. The human and herpesvirus saimiri DHFRs share 83 percent positional identity in amino acid sequence. The herpesvirus saimiri DHFR gene is devoid of intron sequences, suggesting that it was acquired by some process involving reverse transcription. This is to our knowledge the first example of a mammalian virus with a gene for DHFR.\r"

The usefulness of the technique is increased by repeating the test during the hospital course and by calculating a DTH score, which is the sum of the diameter of induration of all five or six tests expressed in millimeters. Regression analysis of factors that could possibly indicate development of sepsis and death after surgical treatment reveals that the most powerful predictors are serum albumin, DTH score and age of the patient. The population of patients who are anergic are more frequently malnourished than reactive patients, but the DTH response cannot be used to determine the malnourished state in individual patients. The lack of a DTH reaction (anergy) identifies an immune defect characterized by a failure of release of lymphokines in vivo. Lymphokines from normal individuals can restore to normal the absent response of anergic patients to specific antigens. In experimental animals made anergic by a heat injury, the mortality rate from bacterial peritonitis can be significantly lowered by lymphokines. Immunomodulation of demonstrated defects in host resistance is an exciting prospect for the future of surgical patients.\r"

All three children with group B streptococcal CNS infections subsequently required multiple CNS shunting procedures and prolonged hospitalizations. Two children suffered major neurological sequelae. In neonates with myelomeningocele, group B streptococci have direct access to the CNS, perhaps explaining the high incidence of serious meningitis and ventriculitis in this population.

  ".W": "Three hundred four patients have undergone cardiac transplantation at the University of Pittsburgh since 1980. Twenty patients have required 27 upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic procedures. After heart transplantation the primary indications for endoscopy were epigastric pain (six patients with gastritis, one with multiple shallow gastric ulcers, and one with normal test results), mild upper GI bleeding (four patients with esophagitis, two with gastritis, and two with multiple shallow gastric ulcers), dysphagia and odynophagia (two patients with esophagitis), persistent nausea and vomiting (one with normal test results), lower GI bleeding (one with normal test results), and routine follow-up (one with normal test results). After heart-lung transplantation the primary indications for the endoscopy were massive upper GI bleeding (three patients with actively bleeding duodenal ulcers), dysphagia and odynophagia (one patient with esophagitis), mild upper GI bleeding (one patient with gastritis), and routine follow-up (one patient with normal test results). No complications resulted from endoscopy. The procedures were performed in the GI suite without cardiac monitoring. Prophylactic antibiotics were not routinely administered. No patient had a fungal infection of the upper GI tract--a finding attributed to the prophylactic use of nystatin in all patients. Opportunistic viral infections were identified histologically in six patients, including two patients with actively bleeding duodenal ulcers. The possibility of opportunistic viral infections in this immunosuppressed group required aggressive diagnostic techniques, including endoscopy and biopsy, which can be safely performed after cardiac transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular biology of graft rejection is not well understood. Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy is a new noninvasive technique for the measurement of intracellular pH and relative amounts of phosphorus-containing compounds, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), inorganic phosphate, phosphocreatine, and sugar phosphates, in any tissue from which a clear signal can be obtained. Biochemical analysis of such precision, without the need for tissue destruction, represents an unusual opportunity for analysis of in vivo cellular metabolism under varying conditions, including graft rejection. 31P NMR study of intra-abdominal viscera has not been feasible in most laboratories without laparotomy because of signal interference from abdominal wall muscle. In this study, to eliminate this interference, a rat kidney was transplanted to the groin, where it could be serially studied without overlying skeletal muscle. This new vascular technique was successful in 11 of 11 attempts and maintained normal serum creatinines in 10 chronic survivors after removal of both native kidneys. The 31P NMR spectroscopic signal from the groin kidney is clear and highly reproducible. This new microvascular model will make it possible to carry out noninvasive long-term spectroscopic studies that could potentially identify a reliable marker for allograft rejection.\r"

Five ultrasonic layers of different echogenicities are displayed; each corresponds to a precise anatomic structure. In gastric diseases this layering evidently changes. In 10 patients with suspected primary gastric lymphoma, EUS showed a characteristic thickening of the second, the second and third layers, or a diffuse, transmural thickening of the entire wall. A precise correlation between the longitudinal and depth infiltration observed at EUS and the surgical finding was seen in all patients. In three cases in which the preoperative bioptic diagnosis was erroneous (two gastritis and one carcinoma) EUS showed a characteristic echographic pattern for lymphoma, which was confirmed at surgery. There was agreement also, in EUS and surgical findings in all patients, about involvement of neighbor organs. It seems possible that in the future EUS could play an important role in detecting, staging, and planning treatment of lymphoma and other gastric tumors.\r"

  ".U": "88145923\r", 
  ".W": "Isolated hepatocyte studies demonstrated that leucine can be a precursor of ketone bodies. In this study we examine the relative contribution of leucine to hepatic ketogenesis in vivo. Three groups of conscious dogs with long-term indwelling catheters in the femoral artery, hepatic vein, and portal vein were studied. Group I (n = 3) animals were fasted overnight for 24 hours, and those in groups II and III (n = 4, each) were fasted for 62 to 68 hours (designated 3-day fast). Groups I and III received intravenous saline solution (0.9%) and served as controls. In group II selective acute insulin deficiency (SAID) was induced by a peripheral intravenous somatostatin (SRIF) infusion and intraportal glucagon (0.55 ng/body weight/min). Net hepatic production (NHP) of ketone bodies (kb) and leucine (leu) was measured by the arteriovenous difference technique. Hepatic conversion of leucine to ketone bodies was measured by continuous infusion of L-U-[14C]-leucine and by determination of the appearance of [14C]-ketone bodies across the liver. In the group fasted overnight NHPleu was 0.02 +/- 0.01 mumol/kg/min, a value not different from zero. NHPkb was 3.1 +/- 0.1 mumol/kg/min and hepatic conversion of leucine to ketone bodies accounted for 3.5% of NHPkb. Insulin deficiency after 3 day's fasting resulted in a near 70% increase in NHPleu (from basal values of 0.31 +/- 0.1 mumol/kg/min to 0.52 +/- 0.06 mumol/kg/min during SAID, p less than 0.01). NHPkb increased from 11.0 +/- 1.0 to 15.5 mumol/kg/min (p less than 0.05). The rate of leucine conversion to ketone bodies (L-C) increased from 1.1 +/- 0.25 to 2.4 +/- 0.3 mumol/kg/min (p less than 0.01) with SAID. We conclude that as the dog progresses to fasting, the contribution of leucine carbon to hepatic production of ketone bodies increases from 3.5% to 10% (p less than 0.01), and this value increases to 15% (p less than 0.01 versus groups I and II) after SAID. Furthermore, the amount of leucine carbon taken up by the liver was not sufficient to account for all [14C]-labeled leucine to ketone bodies. The data suggest that the leucine carbon converted to ketone bodies must have been derived from intrahepatic protein sources of possibly from the keto acids of leucine, which are derived by the breakdown of leucine at distant sites, such as skeletal muscle or adipose tissue.\r"

Embolization was suspected when, in the absence of an exit, routine x-ray films showed the missile in a distant location. Angiography and echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis. Peripheral arterial emboli were extracted while cerebral and venous emboli were kept, as they caused transient symptoms and remained silent.\r"

To determine whether regional differences in brain enzyme activity might exist and therefore affect the amount of enzyme released, we quantified the levels of creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase in 12 regions of normal canine brain (n = 4). Adenylate kinase activity varied the least among regions (49 +/- 7 units/g), followed by lactate dehydrogenase activity (122 +/- 28 units/g). The pattern for both adenylate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase was higher activity in predominantly gray matter areas, lower activity in white matter, and intermediate activity in mixed regions. The distribution of creatine kinase brain isoenzyme and mitochondrial creatine kinase in canine brain was less predictable, showing wider variations among regions (isoenzyme, 462 +/- 116 units/g; mitochondrial, 42 +/- 20 units/g). Even cerebral gray matter demonstrated substantial regional variations in creatine kinase brain isoenzyme, ranging from 606 units/g in the parietal cortex to 329 units/g in the temporal cortex. We conclude that the content of creatine kinase brain isoenzyme varies more than twofold among areas of brain. This regional variation may be important in the interpretation of creatine kinase brain isoenzyme measurements in cerebrospinal fluid and serum used to assess neurologic injury following stroke.\r"

Morphologic studies reveal structural damage to the penile autonomic nerves. Biochemical, histochemical, and immunohistochemical evidence suggests a general depletion of the adrenergic, cholinergic, and NANC neurotransmitter systems that control penile erection. These in vitro studies on human tissue are, however, not performed with appropriate control tissue from potent patients with diabetes mellitus. For this reason, it is important to study diabetic penile neuropathy by developing animal models. The investigative work by Crowe and Fani in streptozocin-induced diabetes mellitus is encouraging, but more research efforts should be directed toward this objective. Clinical testing is needed to assess the functionality of the autonomic corporal nerves objectively. At present, the patient's erectile response to an intracavernosal injection of vasoactive agents is being studied. If there is an isolated autonomic neuropathy, as commonly exists in young patients with spinal cord injury, the erectile response to the intracavernosal injection is immediate and complete. This intracavernosal injection test for autonomic neuropathy records hemodynamic and not neurophysiologic responses. In patients with an accompanying hemodynamic impairment, such as cavernosal artery insufficiency or corporal veno-occlusive dysfunction, as commonly exists in patients with diabetes mellitus, the hemodynamic erectile response to the intracavernosal injection is impaired, and the presence or absence of autonomic neuropathy is subsequently masked.\r"

The goals of sex therapy are to enhance attentional focus on sexual cues and to lessen distractions in the form of anxiety, conflict, or other stresses. Although there continue to be methodologic problems in outcome evaluation research of multidisciplinary treatment of sexual dysfunction, follow-up studies generally indicate improvements in sexual functioning, satisfaction, and self-esteem.\r"

  ".W": "Penodynamics, the functional evaluation of erection after intracavernous injection of vasoactive drugs, is a simple screening test that excludes significant vascular problems if full erection occurs within a reasonable period of time. Although it is more invasive than the penile brachial index (PBI), it is well tolerated and easy to perform. There is good evidence that studies on the flaccid penis are less accurate and do not correlate well with the results of functional papaverine testing. To evaluate arteriogenic impotence, sonography and pulsed Doppler analysis combined with papaverine injections provide objective and reproducible measurements of diameter increase and blood flow of each penile artery and have the advantage of being a functional study. Although this equipment is expensive, it is available in many centers where noninvasive vascular flow studies are performed. With training, the technique can be mastered by anyone. The arterial response to papaverine and the resulting erection allow indirect judgment about the venous system. Therefore, the whole penile vasculature can be evaluated with this technique. Currently, many drugs or drug combinations are used to induce artificial erection, not only for diagnosis but also as a therapeutic alternative to penile prostheses. The only physiologic agent is prostaglandin E1, a substance that seems to be as effective as papaverine but can be metabolized within the cavernous tissue and reportedly results in fewer incidences of prolonged erection and priapism. The use of vasoactive drugs is also very helpful for angiographic studies by improving flow and diameter of the penile vessels, which will result in better images of the arterial lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most importantly, the Ig genes have proved to be the sites of interchromosomal translocations that contribute directly to the malignant phenotype.

  ".W": "In summary, the best diet for an insulin-requiring diabetic person is a diet that can be best integrated into the person's lifestyle, one that is best matched to an insulin regimen acceptable to that person, and one that leads to the best control of the 24-hour integrated blood glucose concentration. Should future research indicate that a very high-CHO, low-fat diet is of additional benefit to the patient, then the dietary recommendations to the patient should be altered accordingly. It should be understood that diabetes is a chronic disease that requires intensive effort by the patient if reasonable management is to be attained. We should not complicate this management unnecessarily by dietary intervention unless clear benefits can be observed. For the type II, noninsulin-requiring diabetic person, dietary recommendations are even less certain. Obese patients should be encouraged to lose weight and to maintain a more ideal body weight, but one should not be disappointed if the patient is unable to accomplish this. Medical indications for weight loss rarely have been sufficient motivation for patients to remain on a semistarvation diet. Should safe, effective anorexigenic drugs become available, they clearly would be the treatment of choice for these patients. The best weight-maintenance diet for type II diabetic persons remains to be determined. A high-CHO, low-fat diet would appear to be best, provided it results in a more normal average level of blood glucose. An increase in dietary soluble fiber also may be useful in reducing the serum cholesterol concentration. In such a diet, those CHO foods that raise the postprandial glucose concentration the least should be emphasized.\r"

A variety of technological advances--the establishment of T cell clones, the production of MAb, the production of pure lymphokines through gene cloning, the modification of target cells by gene transfer and synthetic peptides--has led to tremendous strides in our understanding of CTL function and their role in the pathophysiology of a variety of disease states. It is likely that future efforts will generate important applications of such understanding, such as the pharmacologic modulation of CTL activity and proliferation, novel vaccines, and the introduction of adoptive transfer of cloned CTL as a clinically practical therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we attempted to determine whether administration of iloprost (ZK 36374), a chemically stable prostacyclin analogue, would reduce infarct size after experimental coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. One hour of coronary artery occlusion was performed in 28 open-chest, anesthetized rabbits++, followed by 5 hours of reperfusion. Two minutes after occlusion, 99mTc-labeled albumin microspheres were injected into the left atrium for later assessment of the area at risk of infarction. Fifteen minutes after occlusion animals were randomly assigned to either the treatment group (iloprost, 1.2 micrograms/kg/min intravenously for 6 hours; n = 14) or the control group (n = 14). In vitro platelet aggregation was inhibited in rabbits receiving iloprost. In 10 rabbits (five treated and five control) regional myocardial blood flow was also measured by means of differentially labeled radioactive microspheres. Infarct size was significantly smaller in treated rabbits (53.6 +/- 4.1% of the risk zone vs 89.4 +/- 3.8% in control rabbits; p less than 0.001). Flow to the nonischemic myocardium was higher in treated animals, that is, 1.87 +/- 0.20 ml/min/gm of tissue 50 minutes after occlusion and 1.90 +/- 0.20 ml/min/gm of tissue 4 hours after reperfusion, compared with 1.54 +/- 0.20 and 1.64 +/- 0.30 ml/min/gm of tissue, respectively, in control rabbits (p less than 0.01). Collateral flow to the ischemic region was not affected by the drug. Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and pressure-rate product in treated rabbits were not significantly different from values in control rabbits. In conclusion, administration of iloprost reduced myocardial infarct size in this model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in absence of major hemodynamic effects.\r"
