This task is equivalent to solving an \"ill-posed\" computational problem because the number of degrees of freedom of the musculoskeletal apparatus is much larger than that specified in the plan of action. Some of the mechanisms and circuitry underlying the transformation of motor plans into motor commands are described. A central feature of this transformation is a coarse map of limb postures in the premotor areas of the spinal cord. Vectorial combination of motor outputs among different areas of the spinal map may produce a large repertoire of motor behaviors.\r"

  ".W": "Incubation of the apoB2 subunit of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase with Fe2+ and O2 produces native B2, which contains the tyrosyl radical-dinuclear iron cluster cofactor required for nucleotide reduction. The chemical mechanism of this reconstitution reaction was investigated by stopped-flow absorption spectroscopy and by rapid freeze-quench EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy. Two novel intermediates have been detected in the reaction. The first exhibits a broad absorption band centered at 565 nanometers. Based on known model chemistry, this intermediate is proposed to be a mu-peroxodiferric complex. The second intermediate exhibits a broad absorption band centered at 360 nanometers and a sharp, isotropic EPR signal with g = 2.00. When the reaction is carried out with 57Fe2+, this EPR signal is broadened, demonstrating that the intermediate is an iron-coupled radical. Variation of the ratio of Fe2+ to B2 in the reaction and comparison of the rates of formation and decay of the intermediates to the rate of formation of the tyrosyl radical (.Y122) suggest that both intermediates can generate .Y122. This conclusion is supported by the fact that both intermediates exhibit an increased lifetime in a mutant B2 subunit (B2-Y122F) lacking the oxidizable Y122. Based on these kinetic and spectroscopic data, a mechanism for the reaction is proposed. Unlike reactions catalyzed by heme-iron peroxidases, oxygenases, and model complexes, the reconstitution reaction appears not to involve high-valent iron intermediates.\r"

  ".W": "It is widely thought that animals switch gaits at speeds that minimize energetic cost. Horses naturally switched from a trot to a gallop at a speed where galloping required more energy than trotting, and thus, the gait transition actually increased the energetic cost of running. However, by galloping at this speed, the peak forces on the muscles, tendons, and bones, and presumably the chance of injury, are reduced. When the horses carried weights, they switched from a trot to a gallop at a lower speed but at the same critical level of force. These findings suggest that the trot-gallop transition is triggered when musculoskeletal forces reach a critical level.\r"

In mitosis, as the nuclear envelope breaks down, hnRNPs disperse throughout the cell. At the end of mitosis, hnRNPs dissociate and their proteins are transported into the daughter cell nuclei separately. Some are transported immediately (early group), while others are transported later (late group). Transport of the late group appears to require transcription by RNA polymerase II, in that inhibitors of this polymerase cause the late proteins to remain in the cytoplasm. Thus, there are two modes, transcription-dependent and transcription-independent, for the transport of nuclear proteins.\r"

The presence of 2'-fluorouridines, 2'-fluorocytidines, or 2'-aminouridines did not appreciably decrease catalytic efficiency. Incorporation of 2'-aminocytidines decreased ribozyme activity approximately by a factor of 20. The replacement of all adenosines with 2'-fluoroadenosines abolished catalysis in the presence of MgCl2 within the limits of detection, but some activity was retained in the presence of MnCl2. This effect on catalysis was localized to a specific group of adenines within the conserved single-stranded region of the ribozyme. The decrease in catalytic efficiency was caused by a decrease in the rate constant; the Michaelis constant was unaltered. The 2'-fluoro and 2'-amino modifications conferred resistance toward ribonuclease degradation. Ribozymes containing 2'-fluoro- or 2'-aminonucleotides at all uridine and cytidine positions were stabilized against degradation in rabbit serum by a factor of at least 10(3) compared to unmodified ribozyme.\r"

Cell lines were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of an HTLV-I-seronegative patient with mycosis fungoides. DNA hybridization analysis revealed the presence of HTLV-I-related sequences with unusual restriction endonuclease sites. Sequence analysis of subcloned fragments demonstrated the presence of a monoclonally integrated provirus with a 5.5-kilobase deletion involving large regions of gag and env and all of pol. Additional evidence for the presence of deleted proviruses was found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA from cutaneous lesions of five other HTLV-I-seronegative patients. The findings suggest that HTLV-I infection may be involved in the etiology of at least certain cases of mycosis fungoides.\r"

Furthermore, recombinant HIV surface glycoprotein gp120 bound to GalC but not to other glycolipids.

The 4-kilodalton amyloid beta protein is derived from a larger amyloid precursor protein and forms amyloid deposits in the brain by an unknown pathological mechanism. Except for aged nonhuman primates, there is no animal model for Alzheimer's disease. Transgenic mice expressing amyloid beta protein in the brain could provide such a model. To investigate this possibility, the 4-kilodalton human amyloid beta protein was expressed under the control of the promoter of the human amyloid precursor protein in two lines of transgenic mice. Amyloid beta protein accumulated in the dendrites of some but not all hippocampal neurons in 1-year-old transgenic mice. Aggregates of the amyloid beta protein formed amyloid-like fibrils that are similar in appearance to those in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.\r"

In fact, V beta 14+ T cells were virtually undetectable in the peripheral blood of a majority of these RA patients. beta-chain sequences indicated that one or a few clones dominated the V beta 14+ population in the synovial fluid of individual RA patients, whereas oligoclonality was less marked for other V beta's and for V beta 14 in other types of inflammatory arthritis. These results implicate V beta 14-bearing T cells in the pathology of RA. They also suggest that the etiology of RA may involve initial activation of V beta 14+ T cells by a V beta 14-specific superantigen with subsequent recruitment of a few activated autoreactive v beta 14+ T cell clones to the joints while the majority of other V beta 14+ T cells disappear.\r"

Despite recent progress in the molecular analysis of voltage-activated K+ channels, Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels have not been similarly characterized. The Drosophila slowpoke (slo) locus, mutations of which specifically abolish a Ca(2+)-activated K+ current in muscles and neurons, provides an opportunity for molecular characterization of these channels. Genomic and complementary DNA clones from the slo locus were isolated and sequenced. The polypeptide predicted by slo is similar to voltage-activated K+ channel polypeptides in discrete domains known to be essential for function. Thus, these results indicate that slo encodes a structural component of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels.\r"

The open probability of a large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel from rat brain, incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, is increased by the addition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the cytoplasmic side of the channel. This modulation takes place without the addition of protein kinase, requires Mg2+, and is mimicked by an ATP analog that serves as a substrate for protein kinases but not by a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. Addition of protein phosphatase 1 reverses the modulation by MgATP. Thus, there may be an endogenous protein kinase activity firmly associated with this K+ channel. Some ion channels may exist in a complex that contains regulatory protein kinases and phosphatases.\r"

When equal proportions of normal marrow progenitors and blast cells were mixed, exposed to the oligodeoxynucleotides, and assayed for residual colony formation, the majority of residual cells were normal.

However, IMA vasospasm may contribute to myocardial ischemia and early postoperative morbidity. To investigate mechanisms of vasospasm, we compared the reactivity of human and canine IMA segments in vitro to agonists known to release endothelium-derived contracting factor and endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Rings (4 mm in length) of human and canine IMA were studied in organ chambers. Human and canine vascular smooth muscle exhibited comparable contraction to norepinephrine (maximum = 7.55 +/- 0.63 gm and 6.4 +/- 0.90 gm, respectively) and relaxation to sodium nitroprusside. Human and canine IMAs exhibited comparable endothelium-derived relaxing factor-mediated relaxations to acetylcholine (human) and methacholine (canine). Human and canine IMA also exhibited comparable endothelium-dependent contraction to hypoxia (to 173.3% +/- 8.1% and 178.9% +/- 16.0% of initial prehypoxic tension; means +/- SEM; n = 12). Endothelium-dependent contraction to hypoxia in human and canine IMA could be attenuated by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (10(-6) mol/L), a competitive inhibitor of L-arginine metabolism (n = 9 and n = 10 for human and canine; p less than 0.05). These studies establish that the canine is an appropriate model for study of human IMA vascular reactivity and that hypoxia can induce the release of an L-arginine-dependent, endothelium-derived contracting factor in the human and canine IMA. In vivo, the release of endothelium-derived contracting factor in response to hypoxemia may be cause of IMA vasospasm.\r"

Because exogenous adenosine has been shown to protect the ischemic myocardium, we hypothesized that augmentation of endogenous adenosine levels would attenuate myocardial stunning. To induce stunning, anesthetized dogs were subjected to 15 minutes of ischemia (left anterior descending artery occlusion) followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA; 5 mg/kg/hr), an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, was used to augment adenosine levels. The effect of EHNA on interstitial fluid (ISF) adenosine levels, coronary blood flow, and regional systolic wall thickening was compared with that of an untreated group (n = 8). EHNA increased preischemia ISF adenosine levels threefold and was associated with a corresponding increase in coronary blood flow. EHNA administration did not alter preischemia systolic wall thickening. Although ISF adenosine increased fourfold during ischemia in the untreated group, ISF adenosine increased nearly sixtyfold above preischemia values in the EHNA-treated group and remained elevated throughout reperfusion. Postischemic regional function was enhanced significantly in the group treated with EHNA. These data show that adenosine deaminase inhibition increased ISF adenosine levels and attenuated myocardial stunning. Metabolic manipulation of myocardial ISF nucleoside levels may be beneficial in limiting postischemic myocardial dysfunction.\r"

Vein grafts (n = 5) were interposed in the common carotid artery and explanted after 10 minutes. Distended veins were inflated in vitro with modified Krebs' solution at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes at pressures of either 20 mm Hg (D-20; n = 5) or 80 mm Hg (D-80; n = 5). Externally supported veins (ES-80; n = 5) were inflated at 80 mm Hg pressure, but distention was prevented by covering with a 3 mm internal diameter polytetrafluoroethylene sleeve. Bradykinin-induced in vitro maximal tension was attenuated significantly in vein grafts (0.13 +/- 0.04 g) and D-80 rings (0.27 +/- 0.07 g) compared with D-20 rings (1.20 +/- 0.14 g), ES-80 rings (0.99 +/- 0.13 g), or nondistended control rings (n = 40; 1.19 +/- 0.10 g; p less than 0.001). The attenuation in contraction in the vein graft and D-80 groups was nonspecific (i.e., similar results were obtained with respect to other smooth muscle agonists). Contractile function was inversely associated with wall tension, the product of pressure and radius (r2 = 0.7438; p = 0.06). In contrast, there were no differences in endothelium-dependent or endothelium-independent relaxation among the five groups. It is concluded that, in this experimental system, (1) venous smooth muscle function is significantly attenuated after short-term in vitro distention or grafting although endothelial function is largely preserved, and (2) the decrement in contraction is due to elevated wall tension.\r"

We postulated that hepatic failure after liver resection was related to gut-derived endotoxemia. Rats were randomized to receive oral gavage twice daily with one of the following preparations: (1) 0.9% saline; (2) neomycin sulfate and cefazolin; (3) cholestyramine; (4) lactulose. After 7 days of gavage, animals underwent either a two-thirds partial hepatectomy or sham operation. At time 0 (preresection), 10, 20, and 30 hours after resection, aortic blood was obtained for determination of ammonia, glutamine, and endotoxin levels. In selected animals, portal vein or inferior caval blood was obtained simultaneously with the aortic sample to evaluate the glutamine and ammonia exchange across the intestine and hind limb. Germ-free rats also underwent a partial hepatectomy or sham operation, and blood was obtained for glutamine and ammonia exchange at 0 and 20 hours after resection. Hepatectomy in the saline-pretreated rats resulted in a sixfold increase in plasma glutamine, increased uptake of glutamine and release of ammonia by the gut, increased release of glutamine by the hind-limb, and a high mortality rate. Pretreatment with agents that altered gut contents reduced the endotoxemia, maintained normal glutamine and ammonia levels, and reduced the mortality rate. Germ-free rats had a similar response to that seen in treated animals. Altering the gut contents in this model reduced the level of endotoxemia, blunted the catabolic response, and enhanced survival.\r"

Sequential expression of nuclear and cytosolic protooncogenes accompanies the restoration of normal liver function and architecture. Although cirrhosis is known to inhibit liver regeneration, the effects of noncirrhotic cholestasis on hepatocellular proliferation, differentiation, and regulatory gene expression are unknown. To examine this, 25 male Fisher rats underwent common bile duct ligation and division. A 47% +/- 5% PH was performed 10 days after common bile duct ligation and division when histologic analysis revealed cholestasis without cirrhosis. Despite early elevations of total hepatic DNA and RNA values, cholestatic livers demonstrated a significant threefold suppression of expected hepatocyte mitotic indexes 48 and 72 hours after PH, compared with livers after PH alone. Weight restoration in cholestatic livers was 11% +/- 5.2% compared with 40% +/- 4.3% in control livers (+/- SEM; p less than 0.001) 5 days after PH. Analysis of regenerating liver messenger RNA with complementary DNA probes revealed an abnormal, sustained elevation of K-ras expression in cholestatic livers through all time points. Cholestasis blunted but did not obliterate normal sequential elevations in H-ras found in control livers. The expression of c-myc was inhibited threefold with cholestasis 72 hours after PH. These results are the first indication that cholestasis alone inhibits hepatocyte proliferation and the expression of c-myc that normally precedes the first wave of mitosis. This implies that cholestasis without cirrhosis may alter programmed liver gene expression, inhibiting normal hepatic regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "Ischemia and reperfusion stimulate several adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent processes involving release of substances including free radicals. This cellular response is mediated through receptors responsive to transcriptional products of gene expression; c-fos acts as a transcriptional factor involved in the regulation of genes associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. We hypothesized that nitrone free-radical spin traps promote restoration of cytosolic ATP during reperfusion and prevent c-fos induction. Four control rats had no ischemia. Global hepatic ischemia was induced in 19 rats in four groups: saline solution, phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN), alpha 1-pyridyl-N-oxide N-tert-butyl nitrone (POBN), and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). ATP and intracellular pH were measured at intervals before, during, and after ischemia. At 90 minutes of reperfusion, liver c-fos mRNA was measured. A fourfold elevation of c-fos occurred in the saline-treated group (p less than 0.001). PBN and POBN groups did not differ from the saline group. DMPO resulted in significantly less induction of c-fos than did NS. ATP depletion and recovery in all treatment groups was similar to that of the saline group. We conclude that (1) nitrone spin traps do not prevent c-fos induction or alter the pattern of ATP recovery after hepatic ischemia and reperfusion and (2) c-fos induction is not necessary for restoration of ATP, but the rate of ATP restoration is inversely related to c-fos induction.\r"

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is secreted by macrophages in response to endotoxin and mediates some of the toxicity of endotoxin. This study investigates the effects of pentoxifylline on endotoxin-stimulated TNF production in vitro and in vivo. Pentoxifylline concentrations of 100 and 1000 micrograms/ml inhibited TNF production by murine adherent peritoneal exudate cells incubated with endotoxin 1 microgram/ml. Similarly, pentoxifylline at 100 and 1000 micrograms/ml decreased the number of available TNF messenger RNA transcripts in peritoneal exudate cells assessed by Northern blot. Pentoxifylline had no effect on TNF mRNA stability, but appeared to act by inhibiting the rate of TNF mRNA production (transcription). In murine in vivo experiments at each dose of endotoxin administered from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg, pentoxifylline treatment significantly reduced serum TNF levels, suggesting a favorable shift of the endotoxin dose-response curve. Expression of murine TNF gene in the livers of these animals showed fewer TNF transcripts in the pentoxifylline-treated animals compared to controls. Pentoxifylline inhibited endotoxin-induced TNF production both in vivo and in vitro and exerted this control by inhibiting endotoxin-induced transcription of the TNF gene. This study suggests that pentoxifylline may ameliorate endotoxic shock by decreasing macrophage TNF production.\r"

Because previous studies suggested a role for pentoxifylline in attenuating the toxic effects of IL-2, we hypothesized that pentoxifylline would inhibit alterations in the microvasculature induced by IL-2 and would ultimately reduce IL-2-induced toxicity. To determine the validity of this hypothesis, we prepared four groups of rats for in vivo microvascular observation. In the first group, a bolus intravenous injection of IL-2 (1 x 10(6) units/kg) acutely induced hypotension, tachypnea, hypoxia, increased lung water, decreased microvascular blood flow, and increased leukocyte-endothelial adherence. No significant changes occurred in animals treated by pentoxifylline alone or the control IL-2 vehicle-alone group. However, pentoxifylline inhibited many of the IL-2-induced systemic and microvascular effects, such as hypotension, tachypnea, increased lung water, hypoxia, and increased leukocyte-endothelial adherence, but not tachycardia or increased microvascular protein leakage. These data support our hypothesis that systemic toxicities induced by IL-2 are associated with alterations in the microcirculation, which may be ameliorated by pentoxifylline.\r"

  ".W": "Activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) associated with sepsis. Adhesion of activated PMNs to endothelial monolayers is mediated by the CD18 adhesion-receptor complex on the PMN cell surface. Monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) blocks CD18-dependent PMN-endothelial adhesion in vitro and in vivo. This study was designed to determine the role of CD18-dependent PMN adhesion in ALI associated with gram-negative sepsis. Anesthetized, ventilated (FiO2 0.5, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O) pigs received sterile saline (control, n = 8) or live Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 x 10(8) colony-forming units/ml at 0.3 ml/20 kg/min (septic, n = 9) for 1 hour. A third group (n = 7) received MoAb 60.3, 2 mg/kg intravenously, 15 minutes before Pseudomonas infusion. Animals were studied for 300 minutes. MoAb 60.3 significantly (p less than 0.05) attenuated the neutropenia seen in sepsis (15 +/- 1 vs 6 +/- 1 x 10(3) PMNs/mm3 at 300 min). Alveolar-capillary membrane injury was assessed by bronchoalveolar-lavage protein content and extravascular lung water determination. MoAb 60.3 significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced BAL protein at 300 minutes (388 +/- 75 vs 1059 +/- 216 micrograms/ml in septic animals) and attenuated the increase in extravascular lung water to 240 minutes (7.1 +/- 2 vs 14.2 +/- 1.2 ml/kg in septic animals). Systemic hypotension, decreased cardiac index, pulmonary hypertension, and relative hypoxemia, all characteristic of this model, were not altered by MoAb 60.3. These data suggest that, in this model of septic ALI, neutropenia is, in part, CD18 dependent and that blocking CD18-dependent PMN adhesion protects the alveolar-capillary membrane independently of altered hemodynamic status.\r"

However, concern exists that interference with normal polymorphonuclear neutrophil host-defense functions may increase susceptibility to bacterial infection. We compared the development of subcutaneous Staphylococcus aureus abscesses in rabbits pretreated with MAb 60.3 to those pretreated with saline placebo. Bacterial inoculation with 10(6) or 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) did not result in abscess formation in either control or antibody-treated groups. However, inoculation with 10(8) CFU resulted in more frequent and larger abscesses in antibody-treated rabbits than in controls. Abscess incidence was similar for inoculation with 10(9) CFU, although antibody-treated rabbits developed larger abscesses than did controls. The difference in abscess development is due to delayed leukocyte migration into inoculated tissue. The results of these experiments suggest that subjects treated with MAb 60.3 and exposed to massive S. aureus inocula may be at serious risk of infection. However, despite inhibited leukocyte adhesion, inocula of up to 10(7) CFU were well tolerated in this model. Whether these findings are clinically important remains to be determined, although exposure to bacterial concentrations of 10(8) CFU or greater occurs only rarely in clinical practice.\r"

KC function within a unique microenvironment in which high hepatic arginase activities (25 times greater than those activities in the kidney) result in negligible local L-arginine levels. To evaluate the relevance of this profound arginine deficiency on the physiologic function of KC, the kinetics of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) production and autoregulatory eicosanoid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production were compared in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated KC cultured with (1200 mumol/L) and without (10 mumol/L) L-arginine media. In (+)arginine culture the KC TNF-alpha production peaked early before decreasing as PGE2 production increased. In (-)arginine culture, however, KC TNF-alpha production was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced, whereas PGE2 production was amplified (p less than 0.01). When cyclooxygenase blockade with indomethacin completely prevented KC production of PGE2 in (-)arginine culture, TNF-alpha production was upregulated (p less than 0.001 vs (-)arginine; p not significant vs (+)arginine). These arginine-specific depression of TNF-alpha responses appeared unique to KC because both TNF-alpha and PGE2 levels increased when peritoneal, pleural, and alveolar macrophages were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide in (-)arginine medium. This PGE2-dependent autoregulation of potentially harmful lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha responses may reflect an evolutionary adaptation by KC to their local hepatic environment and strategic anatomic position in the portal circuit, which optimally removes endotoxin and naturally protects the host.\r"

Therefore, we hypothesized that cis-dichlorodiammine platinum (CDDP), mitomycin-C, and doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin), by the release of ROS, would increase macrophage TNF production. Murine macrophages were incubated for 20 hours with varying doses of the chemotherapeutic drugs and 2.5 micrograms/ml endotoxin. Both CDDP and mitomycin-C increased TNF production compared to nondrug-exposed cells. Peak TNF values occurred at 10 micrograms/ml CDDP and 62.5 micrograms/ml mitomycin-C with 377 +/- 38 and 427 +/- 54 units/ml TNF produced, respectively. These increases were significant (p2 less than 0.05) compared to the nonchemotherapy; but endotoxin-exposed macrophages (CDDP 11 +/- 3 units/ml; mitomycin-C 10 +/- 3 units/ml). Only CDDP-increased production of TNF from non-endotoxin-primed macrophages (0 microgram/ml CDDP - 0 +/- 0 unit/ml TNF; 50 micrograms/ml CDDP - 13 +/- 5 units/ml TNF; p2 less than 0.038). 5-Fluorouracil, a non-ROS-generating chemotherapeutic, and Adriamycin failed to amplify TNF production. By Northern blot analysis, CDDP induced transcription of the TNF gene in non-endotoxin-primed macrophages as early as 3 hours after exposure to 50 micrograms/ml CDDP, and this preceded the increase in TNF protein in kinetic studies. Because CDDP, mitomycin-C, and Adriamycin all produce ROS, the mechanism for this selective chemotherapy-induced cytokine amplification remains unclear. This finding may explain both indirect toxic and tumoricidal properties of CDDP and mitomycin-C.\r"

We have now extended this model to examine whether developing precursor rat T cells from rat bone marrow stem cells can undergo normal differentiation in mature lymphocytes under the influence of a xenogeneic mouse thymus. We examined thymic and splenic lymphoid cells from fully xenogeneic chimeras starting 1 week after bone marrow transplantation to characterize early T-cell repopulation and phenotype. Our data suggest that developing rat precursor T cells are able to undergo normal differentiation in the mouse thymus. The first precursor T cells appeared 2 weeks after reconstitution and by week 10 accounted for more than 90% of thymocytes present in the chimeras. In chimeras, developing rat T lymphocytes in the mouse thymus exhibited an immature pattern (Thy 1.1+, alpha beta-TCRdull, CD4+ plus CD8+) when analyzed by flow cytometry. This pattern was similar to a normal rat. In contrast, splenic T-lymphoid cells showed a mature rat phenotype (Thy 1.1-, alpha beta-TCRhi, CD4+ or CD8+), again similar to a normal rat. This development began 2 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, and both thymus and spleen from chimeras exhibited \"normal\" rat T-cell staining profiles by 10 weeks after reconstitution. Overall, these data indicate that developing rat T cells are capable of undergoing normal maturation in a xenogeneic mouse thymus of tolerant animals.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the specific tissue distribution of neurotensin messenger RNA (mRNA) and to examine the molecular mechanisms that regulate intestinal neurotensin gene expression and content. In the first experiment, various segments of gut tissue from three Sprague-Dawley rats were harvested, and polyadenylated RNA was extracted for Northern hybridization with a rat neurotensin probe. In the second experiment, 32 Sprague-Dawley rats were fasted for 72 hours and then killed at 0, 3, 12, and 24 hours after refeeding (n = 8 rats/group). Rats fed ad libitum were killed before fasting (control, n = 8). Distal ileal segments (30 cm) were resected for measurement of neurotensin tissue concentration by radioimmunoassay and extraction of poly (A)+ RNA for Northern hybridization with a rat neurotensin complementary DNA probe. Blots were stripped and reprobed for beta-actin as a control for RNA loading. A nuclear run-on transcription assay was performed to determine the relative rate of neurotensin transcription. In the first experiment, neurotensin messenger RNA transcripts of 1.0 and 1.5 Kb sizes were found throughout the small intestine and proximal colon; the greatest abundance was found in the distal small intestine. In the second experiment, neurotensin tissue concentration was significantly reduced with fasting. Refeeding a diet for 24 hours returned neurotensin concentration to control levels. However, neither the amount of neurotensin messenger RNA nor its rate of transcription were altered by fasting and refeeding. These findings suggest that a posttranscriptional mechanism is responsible for regulation of neurotensin synthesis in gut mucosa.\r"

The mean discrepancy between paired interviewers (1 to 10 scale) was 1.34 +/- 0.10 for the blinded group versus 0.93 +/- 0.06 for the open group (p less than 0.001). Individual and multiple regression analysis were used to test the IS as a dependent variable in the open group, with the blinded group as a control. In each instance (except clerkship grades), the IS correlated more closely with other parameters (p less than 0.05) in the open group. Correlation coefficients were 0.27 (blinded) and 0.64 (open) for weighted scores combining all parameters (p less than 0.001) and 0.39 (blinded) and 0.65 (open) for multiple linear regression analysis (p less than 0.001). We conclude that the IS is significantly influenced if other objective variables are at hand, thus deflating the actual weight of the interview. To accurately quantify the value of the interview, a correction factor must be applied, or, more appropriately, the interview must be conducted blindly.\r"

Abnormally high levels of the protein are found in many different types of cancer. In breast carcinoma overexpression of p53 is associated with point mutations within highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. These altered genes encode stable p53 proteins that can be detected by standard immunohistochemical techniques unable to detect rapidly degraded wild-type protein. The level of p53 expression in 184 primary breast cancer specimens was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis and related to the following established prognostic factors for breast cancer: age, stage, metastatic involvement, concentration of estrogen and progesterone receptors, proliferative index, and HER-2/neu overexpression. Fifty (27%) of these primary breast cancer specimens had widespread overexpression of p53. Highly significant associations were found between p53 overexpression and late stage, metastatic spread, and low concentration of progesterone receptors. The presence of elevated levels of mutant p53 may itself be a prognostic factor in human breast cancer and activation of this oncogene may be important in the ability of a tumor to metastasize.\r"

Some gastrointestinal cancer cells possess functional receptors for VIP; however, the role of VIP in regulation of growth of gastric cancer cells has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to determine whether VIP and other agents that increase cAMP regulate growth of a human gastric cancer cell line (AGS) and whether these agents regulate expression of c-myc proto-oncogene, which is required for cell proliferation. We measured levels of cAMP by radioimmunoassay, and we used Northern blot analysis to examine c-myc messenger RNA expression. Cell-growth studies were carried out in media supplemented with 3% serum, and cells were counted with a Coulter counter. We found that VIP significantly increased cAMP production of AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas secretin, glucagon, and peptide histidine methionine (PHM) did not stimulate cAMP production. Exogenous cAMP (8-bromo-cAMP) inhibited AGS cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. VIP acted synergistically with either isobutylmethyl-xanthine or forskolin to inhibit AGS cell proliferation. The increased c-myc expression, which was induced by serum, was inhibited by simultaneous treatment with VIP and isobutylmethyl-xanthine. We have found that AGS cells have specific, functional VIP receptors (activation of which are negatively correlated with cell growth) and that the mechanism by which VIP acts to inhibit cell growth appears to be due, in part, to cAMP-dependent regulation of c-myc proto-oncogene expression.\r"

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), the regulatory enzyme of hepatic mitochondrial long-chain fatty-acid oxidation, is involved in the control of hepatic fat oxidation in sepsis. Using either H4IIe rat hepatoma cells or rat hepatocytes in primary culture, we tested the hypothesis that interleukin-1-alpha (IL-1 alpha) would modulate CPT transcription (CPT mRNA), CPT translation (35S-methionine CPT protein incorporation), and hepatic mitochondrial oxidation of 1-Carbon 14-labeled (14C) palmitate to ketone bodies (acid soluble products). We showed that IL-1 alpha significantly increased CPT mRNA, 35S-methionine incorporation CPT protein, and hepatic mitochondrial oxidation of 1-14C-palmitate to acid soluble products. We further hypothesized that the Ca2+ second messenger system may play a role in the IL-1 alpha induction of hepatic CPT gene transcription. We showed that either calcium ionophore (A23187) or phorbol myristate acetate increased CPT gene transcription and that either calcium chelation, protein kinase C inhibition (acridine orange), or chronic exposure to phorbol myristate acetate significantly inhibited IL-1 alpha induction of CPT mRNA. We conclude that the IL-1 alpha increases in hepatic mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation may be, in part, secondary to increased CPT gene transcription and translation and that the Ca2+ second messenger system may play an important role in IL-1 alpha induction of CPT gene transcription.\r"

Incubation of PAECs with cytokines (10 to 1000 units/ml) resulted in a significant increase in System ASC-mediated glutamine transport that was dose-dependent, first observable after 8 hours, and maximal after 12 hours of exposure. Kinetic studies indicated that the increase in carrier-mediated activity was not due to a change in Km (transporter affinity) but instead to a 45% to 75% increase in maximal transport rate (Vmax). The cytokine-stimulated increase in glutamine uptake by PAECs was completely blocked by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, indicating that the accelerated glutamine transport was dependent on de novo RNA and protein synthesis, perhaps of the transporter itself. The data indicate that these cytokines accelerate glutamine uptake by PAECs, either directly or indirectly, a response which may be required to support endothelial metabolism, structure, and function during infection and inflammation. The results of this study represent, to our knowledge, the first reports of cytokine-mediated modulation of System ASC activity, a carrier that has historically been unresponsive to hormonal regulation in other tissues.\r"

  ".W": "We examined whether L-arginine is a substrate for nitric oxide (NO) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) in vitro. Minimal extracellular arginine (0.04 mmol/L) is required for maximal lymphocyte proliferation after phytohemagglutinin stimulation. In the absence of arginine, proliferation was 41% of normal without loss of viability. In contrast, MNC total protein synthesis (as assessed by tritiated leucine incorporation) or lymphokine synthesis (interleukin-2, as assessed by cytotoxic lymphoid line (CTLL) proliferation) were not affected by the absence or presence of arginine in the medium. Exogenous nitric oxide provided as sodium nitroprusside could replace L-arginine for maximal blastogenic proliferation. The addition of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA; 0.1 mmol/L), a specific inhibitor of the NO synthetic pathway, significantly reduced DNA synthesis both at 0 and 0.1 mmol/L arginine concentrations; this effect was reversed to 91% of normal by excess arginine (1.0 mmol/L). Homoarginine (0.1 mmol/L; a known substrate for NO production) partially substituted for arginine, and this effect was also abrogated by NMMA. Nitrite levels (an end product of NO metabolism) were reduced when L-arginine was absent or NMMA was added to L-arginine-containing media. Cytosol from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated MNC-enhanced cyclic guanosine monophosphate production in the presence of L-arginine as substrate. The data suggest that the inductive effects of L-arginine on MNC DNA synthesis are not related to its nutrient requirement for protein synthesis, but rather caused by its role as a substrate for NO production. MNC actively synthesize NO during mitogenic proliferation. NO appears to be a promoter of MNC DNA synthesis, probably by its well-known effect as an activator of guanylate cyclase, which increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels.\r"

We have recently shown that nitric oxide is a potent inhibitory molecule in the in vitro rat mixed-splenocyte culture, resulting in inhibition of proliferation and cytolytic T-cell induction. We undertook this study using the sponge matrix allograft model in the rat to determine whether nitric oxide plays a role in an in vivo allograft response. Our experiments showed that on day 6 after grafting, when cytolytic activity of allograft-infiltrating cells is first detected, allogeneic graft fluid contains higher levels of NO2-/NO3- (the stable endproducts of nitric oxide metabolism) than syngeneic graft fluid. Furthermore, evaluation of the supernatants of cultured graft-infiltrating cells revealed that allogeneic graft-infiltrating cells spontaneously produce higher amounts of nitric oxide than syngeneic graft-infiltrating cells. The nitric oxide production was inhibited in the presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA), the competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide production. Most of the nitric oxide production was observed in the adherent macrophage fraction of the allograft-infiltrating cells. When allograft-infiltrating cells were cultured in the presence of NMA, donor-specific cytolytic activity was observed, whereas allograft-infiltrating cells cultured in the absence of NMA showed no cytolytic activity. These data show that nitric oxide production may play an important regulatory role in the allograft response.\r"

In this study we investigated the role of endogenous prostaglandins and angiotensin II in cyclosporine-induced intrarenal vasoconstriction. Split hydronephrotic kidneys in decerebrate rats (n = 16) were suspended in an environmentally controlled tissue bath. Interlobular, afferent, and efferent arteriolar diameters and red blood cell velocity were measured by in vivo video-microscopy and Doppler velocimetry. After topical application of cyclosporine to the kidney in the tissue bath, a 12% +/- 2% constriction of the interlobular and a 28% +/- 5% reduction in interlobular blood flow occurred. The afferent and efferent arterioles also constricted by 13% +/- 2% and 10% +/- 3%, respectively. Prostaglandin inhibition with mefenemate augmented this vasoconstriction (16% +/- 2% at interlobular and 21% +/- 4% at afferent arterioles) and reduction in interlobular blood flow (38% +/- 8%) below baseline values. Mefenemate alone resulted in a 35% +/- 5% reduction in interlobular blood flow, which was not further augmented by cyclosporine. In contrast, local competitive angiotensin II-receptor inhibition with saralasin maintained blood flow after cyclosporine and prevented intrarenal vasoconstriction by cyclosporine. This suggests that prostaglandins protect against intrarenal vasoconstriction and that acute cyclosporine-induced vasoconstriction is mediated through angiotensin II receptors.\r"

Hemorrhage caused intestinal microvascular blood flow to decrease to 10% to 15% of baseline values. In the control group, resuscitation restored cardiac output and mean arterial pressure to baseline values, but intestinal microvascular blood flow remained at 30% of baseline values. In contrast, addition of pentoxifylline to the resuscitation regimen resulted in an immediate hyperemic response with an increase in intestinal microvascular blood flow to significantly greater than baseline values followed by return to baseline. Arteriolar dilation was not responsible for the improvement in flow implicating improved flow dynamics between erythrocytes, granulocytes, and vascular endothelia within the microcirculation. We conclude that addition of pentoxifylline to resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock restores intestinal microvascular blood flow.\r"

Rats were administered a 5 mg/kg dose of MPL at 2 hours and 24 hours before a 25-minute, global, 37 degrees C ischemic insult followed by reperfusion (modified Langendorff). At 40 minutes of reperfusion, ventricular function was assessed (ventricular balloon; developed pressure, rate of contraction, rate of relaxation). Hearts from rats pretreated with MPL 24 hours before isolation exhibited preservation of ventricular function (p less than 0.05). After I/R, hearts from rats pretreated with MPL 24 hours before isolation had increased (p less than 0.05) catalase activity compared to saline pretreated controls and rats pretreated with MPL 2 hours before isolation. We conclude that (1) pretreatment with MPL induces functional protection against cardiac I/R injury, (2) protection (not evident at 2 hours) is maximal at 24 hours, suggesting enzyme induction, and (3) increased catalase activity correlates with the functional protection.\r"

  ".W": "Atherosclerosis of the infrarenal aorta results in distinct clinical entities--aortoiliac occlusive disease (AOD) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Although loss of collagen has been implicated in AAA, collagen accumulation plays a role in AOD. In vivo collagen-gene expression can be assessed using complementary DNA for collagen types I and III alpha-chains. The purpose of this study is to compare total collagen (type I + III) and collagen types I and III messenger RNA in AAA, AOD and normal aorta. Specimens were collected from the infrarenal aorta during operation for AOD (n = 7), AAA (n = 7), autopsy, or organ procurement (normal; n = 7). Northern transfer analysis of total RNA was used to compare mRNA levels for type I and III collagen. After preliminary extraction, specimens were hydrolyzed for hydroxyproline analysis used to calculate total collagen (type I + III). Relative levels of type I (pro-a1[1]) mRNA were greater in both AOD (0.77 +/- 0.35) and AAA tissue (0.94 +/- 0.24; p = 0.6) than in normal aorta (0.02 +/- 0.03). Type III (pro-a1[III]) mRNA levels were also greater in AOD (2.52 +/- 0.19; p = 0.09) and AAA tissue (3.15 +/- 1.3) than in normals (0.97 +/- 0.47). Total collagen concentration was increased in AOD (45.6% +/- 3.1% dry weight; p less than 0.05) but not AAA tissue (27.8% +/- 4%) when compared to normal aorta (34.7% +/- 2.3%). Collagen type I and III gene expression is greater in older, diseased aorta, yet collagen accumulated only in AOD. This implies a similar synthetic response in both AOD and AAA. Thus, proteolytic degradation in AAA appears to determine collagen content and possibly the clinical course of the atherosclerotic process.\r"

  ".W": "Aspirin and dipyridamole have frequently failed to control intimal hyperplasia in vascular grafts in animal and clinical trials. These trials were based on the concept that the smooth muscle mitogen, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) released from platelets, was a major cause of intimal hyperplasia. Both endothelial and smooth muscle cells (ECs and SMCs), however, can also release PDGF-like SMC mitogens that might cause intimal hyperplasia. We therefore tested whether aspirin and dipyridamole alone or together can affect PDGF-A chain mRNA levels in cultured human saphenous vein ECs and SMCs. Cultures were exposed for 72 hours to 3 x 10(-5) mol/L aspirin and/or 5 x 10(-6) mol/L dipyridamole. Cellular RNA was then extracted, and PDGF-A chain mRNA signal levels were measured by a reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction method. mRNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a constitutively expressed control RNA species. Signal strength on Southern blots of amplified polymerase chain reaction products was measured by densitometry. Neither aspirin nor dipyridamole alone or together reduced the ratio (PDGF-A chain signal/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal) below that of control cultures. PDGF-A chain expression was not a constitutive artifact of culture because dibutyryl cyclic AMP (5 x 10(-4) mol/L) reduced PDGF-A chain signal from a control index of 1.0 to 0.5 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SE) (n = 3; p less than 0.05) in EC cultures and to 0.2 (mean) (n = 2) in SMC cultures. These data may explain why aspirin and dipyridamole fail to reduce intimal hyperplasia in some animal and clinical trials despite effective inhibition of platelet aggregation.\r"

It is also known that calcium antagonists produce various beneficial effects on cell and organ function after ischemia and shock. However, it remains unknown whether such agents have any salutary effects on the depressed active hepatocellular function and hepatic blood flow in a nonheparinized model of trauma and hemorrhage. To study this, rats underwent a midline laparotomy (trauma-induced) and were bled to and maintained at a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg until 40% of the maximum bleedout was returned in the form of Ringer's lactate. They were then resuscitated with four times the volume of shed blood with Ringer's lactate over 60 minutes, during and after which diltiazem (400 micrograms/kg body weight) was infused intravenously over 95 minutes. Active hepatocellular function (Vmax and Km) was determined with an in vivo indocyanine green clearance technique. Effective hepatic blood flow (EHBF) was determined by Fick principle and corrected by the indocyanine green extraction ratio. Hepatic microvascular blood flow (HMBF) was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry. Results indicate that Vmax, Km, EHBF, and HMBF decreased significantly at 1.5 and 4 hours after resuscitation. Diltiazem infusion restored the depressed Vmax, Km, EHBF, and HMBF and prevented the occurrence of hepatic edema. Thus, diltiazem may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of trauma and severe hemorrhage even in the absence of blood resuscitation.\r"

Infection was defined as a temperature of 101 degrees F or more and a white blood cell count of more than 12,000/cm3 associated with a positive culture. Eighteen patients developed an infection, and 19 patients did not. On day 1, both groups showed a significant decrease in DI, compared to controls (0.33 +/- 0.18 and 0.34 +/- 0.25 for patients with infection and patients with no infection vs 1.52 +/- 0.12 for control volunteers; p less than 0.05). In the group with no infection, the DI improved in 16 of 19 patients after injury; the DI in patients with infection continued to decrease in 17 of 18 patients. The decrease in DI occurred 4 +/- 2 days (range, 2 to 8 days) before the diagnosis of infection. No significant differences were apparent in the absolute white blood cell count between the group with infection and the group with no infection at any time after injury. Differences in maximal temperature were noted on day 3 and beyond; however, 30% of patients with no infection had a temperature of more than 101 degrees F for 7 days. These data show that trauma results in a significant decrease in RBC deformability and that serial changes in DI appeared to predict which patients would develop an infection and which patients would recover uneventfully. RBC deformability may be helpful in early detection of infection in patients who have suffered trauma.\r"

However it is less clear how to assess the quality of the educational experience the program itself provides. This study examines the use of a resident-directed survey as a means of identifying and rectifying weakness in a surgical training curriculum. Multiple choice questionnaires covering each of 14 senior rotations were prepared by chief residents and distributed to all senior surgical residents in April 1989 (year I). The survey covered factors considered vital to resident education, including operative experience, input into preoperative and postoperative decisions, autonomy, and time demands, and an overall rating (OR) of the educational quality of the rotations. Responses were numerically graded: 1, appropriate; 0, fair; -1, inadequate (or \"excessive\" for the variable \"time demands\"). The results, which were presented and discussed at a departmental retreat that spring, prompted specific curriculum changes for the 1989-1990 academic year. An identical survey was conducted the next spring (year II). Major reorganizational changes were made in three of the four negatively rated rotations from year I. The OR for each of the rotations improved dramatically in year II (average increase of 0.64/rotation; p less than 0.05). None of the eight favorably rated rotations in year I suffered a reduction in OR as a result of the changes. Case load, intraoperative involvement, and input in both preoperative and postoperative decisions correlated most frequently with favorable ORs in both years. This study shows that a resident survey is an effective tool for critically assessing the education curriculum of a surgical training program.\r"

Transport was studied in tissues stripped of muscularis propria and in nonstripped tissue. In nonstripped colon, the action of serotonin (5-hydroxytrytamine [5-HT]) on short-circuit current was inhibited by a factor of 60% by tetrodotoxin (P less than 0.05; t test) and was also inhibited by the 5HT2 antagonist ketanserin (p less than 0.05 vs serotonin; t test) and the 5-HT3 antagonist ICS 205-930 (p less than 0.05 vs serotonin, t test). These compounds produced corresponding inhibition of serotonin-induced sodium and chloride flux in this preparation. The tetrodotoxin-sensitive component was not inhibited by atropine, hexamethonium, phentolamine, or propranolol. Histologic analysis of the stripped preparation showed that it consisted of mucosa and musclaris mucosa only. In this stripped preparation, serotonin-induced change in short-circuit current was tetrodotoxin insensitive and inhibited by ketanserin (p less than 0.05 vs serotonin, t test) but not by ICS 205-930. Serotonin-induced sodium and chloride flux was inhibited by ketanserin in the presence of tetrodotoxin in this preparation. These results suggest that serotonin-induced electrolyte transport in rat distal colon is mediated by nonneural 5HT2 receptors in the mucosa or muscularis mucosa and by 5-HT3 receptors located on enteric nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nerves.\r"

Using our in vivo rabbit model of esophagitis, we have observed that acute luminal exposure (within 1 to 5 minutes) to potentially harmful agents, such as acid, bile, or ethanol, induces a rapid increase in mucosal blood flow; whereas prolonged exposure (10 to 60 minutes) results in mucosal injury and ablation of blood flow. We have also shown that capsaicin-sensitive mucosal afferent nerves can modulate esophageal blood flow. These findings led us to hypothesize that the reactive increase in blood flow induced by luminal agents represents a mechanism of protection mediated by capsaicin-sensitive nerves. The objective of these experiments was to determine if luminal capsaicin, a specific probe for visceral afferent nerves, could both preserve mucosal blood flow and protect against ethanol injury. Rabbits were subjected to luminal instillation of 50% ethanol with or without 1% capsaicin. Blood flow was measured with microspheres at baseline and after 2 and 10 minutes. Rabbits exposed only to ethanol developed severe mucosal injury coincident with near ablation of mucosal blood flow. In contrast, rabbits exposed to ethanol with capsaicin showed protection of the epithelium with a sixfold increase in mucosal blood flow. We conclude that capsaicin-sensitive nerves in the esophagus are local effectors of mucosal protection by virtue of preserving blood flow.\r"

  ".U": "91313530\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic pancreatitis is difficult to treat in patients with a nondilated duct. Patients experiencing intractable pain unresponsive to or judged untreatable by lesser procedures must decide between total pancreatectomy and resultant diabetes or a continuation of their pancreatitis. From 1977 through 1990, 26 patients underwent extensive pancreatectomy and dispersed pancreatic islet tissue autotransplantation for treatment of chronic pancreatitis pain and prophylaxis of surgical diabetes. Of these 26 patients, total (Whipple) or near-total (greater than 95%) pancreatectomy was performed in 24 patients. Of these 24 patients, pain relief could be assessed in 21 patients at 5 to 155 months (mean, 5.7 years), and 19 patients (90%) reported partial or complete remission. Of the patients who underwent total or near-total pancreatectomy, islets were injected intraportally in 22 patients and into the renal subcapsule in two patients. The latter two patients have required insulin since surgery. Of the other 22, one patient died from a complication of the pancreatectomy. Nine of the 21 evaluable recipients of intraportal islet autografts were insulin independent for at least several months after surgery. Five patients are currently insulin independent at 6 years, 4 years, 1.5 years, 9 months, and 5 months after surgery. Of the other four patients, one patient died insulin independent at 6 years, and three patients required insulin beginning 8 to 18 months after surgery. Insulin independence correlated with the number of islets recovered, which in turn correlated inversely with the degree of pancreatic fibrosis. Of our four most recent patients, three patients had mildly to moderately fibrotic glands, and higher numbers of islets were obtained. After total (Whipple) pancreatectomy, these three patients are insulin independent. A liver biopsy was performed in one patient 8 months after total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation; numerous clusters of islet cells staining strongly for insulin and glucagon were detected within portal triads on both wedge and needle biopsy specimens. Morbidity related to the intraportal-dispersed pancreatic islet tissue transplantation was low (no disseminated intravascular coagulation, significant portal hypertension, or hepatic dysfunction). Islet autotransplantation can be an effective and safe adjunct to extensive pancreatic resection for those patients who risk surgical diabetes for relief of their chronic pancreatitis pain.\r"

  ".W": "Although hemorrhage depresses macrophage antigen presentation (AP), a critical component in eliciting an antigen-specific immune response, it is not known which particular step in macrophage AP (i.e., uptake, ingestion, catabolism, or presentation of degraded antigens to T cells) is defective. To study this, C3H/HeN mice were bled to an arterial mean blood pressure of 35 mm Hg, maintained for 60 minutes, and then adequately resuscitated. Peritoneal and splenic macrophage cultures were prepared 2 and 24 hours after hemorrhage. Macrophage AP capacity was measured by coculturing macrophages with the T-helper cell clone D10.G4.1. To gain information about macrophage ability to digest the specific antigen conalbumin, lysosomal activity was bypassed by use of chemically denatured conalbumin peptides. To study macrophage ability to present conalbumin peptides, macrophages were fixed and D10.G4.1 proliferation in response to fragmented conalbumin was determined. AP of native conalbumin by peritoneal macrophages and splenic macrophages was depressed (p less than 0.05) by 50% (peritoneal macrophages) and 55% (splenic macrophages) 2 hours and 57% (peritoneal macrophages) and 35% (splenic macrophages) 24 hours after hemorrhage. In contrast, presentation of conalbumin peptides was only slightly decreased. In addition, the ability of fixed peritoneal macrophages and splenic macrophages to present conalbumin peptides was similar in hemorrhaged and sham mice. Because bypassing of macrophage lysosomal activity with degraded native antigens prevented the suppression of AP, the results suggest that hemorrhage-induced suppression of AP is not caused by a reduced macrophage capacity to present antigenic peptides but by decreased antigen catabolism by macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "Growth factors and amino acids (AA) are required for cell proliferation. A comparison of the AA composition of wound fluid (WF) to that of Eagle's medium reveals that AA in WF may be limiting to cell replication. Yet WF supports fibroblast replication and stimulates AA uptake. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates fibroblast replication and stimulates human wound healing when applied topically. We evaluated the interactions between EGF and AA concentrations found in WF. Wound fibroblasts were cultured in media prepared to mimic the AA concentrations found in WF on days 1, 5, and 10 and in the presence of varying concentrations of EGF. Fibroblasts cultured in all three experimental media showed a dose response to EGF for both tritiated-thymidine uptake (proliferation) and AA uptake. The fibroblast proliferation in response to EGF was augmented by the AA composition of day-5 WF. These data show a dose-dependent effect of EGF on fibroblast replication and AA uptake in the absence of serum that is augmented by the particular AA combination found in day-5 WF and suggests that an optimal physiologic AA profile may aid in EGF stimulation of wound fibroblast replication.\r"

The New Zealand children were also more likely than the Welsh children to have a history of \"wheeze ever\" (27% versus 22%), and wheeze brought on by running (15% versus 10.5%). The sex ratio of asthmatic and wheezy children was very similar in the two countries. A history of hospital admission for chest trouble was twice as common in New Zealand as in South Wales. An exercise test produced a fall in peak expiratory flow rate of 15% or more in more New Zealand children (12.2%) than Welsh children (7.7%). These results suggest that the prevalence of childhood asthma is higher in New Zealand than in South Wales.\r"

Cephalometric radiographs of patients with sleep apnoea were compared with those of snorers without sleep apnoea and those of non-snorers. Fifty two snorers with suspected sleep apnoea had a conventional sleep study and were divided into two groups: those with an apnoea-hypopnoea index greater than 10/h (n = 40, sleep apnoea group) and those whose apnoea-hypopnoea index was 10/h or less (n = 12, snorer group). The cephalometric measurements in these patients were compared with those of 34 non-snoring control subjects. Controls were subdivided into two groups: control group 1 included 17 subjects similar in age to the sleep apnoea and snorer groups (mean (SD) age 50.0 (10.9), 50.7 (9.4), and 50.6 (9.7) years); control group 2 included 15 young men (25.4 (2.6) years). The distance from the mandibular plane to the hyoid bone (MP-H) and the length of the soft palate were greater in the patients with sleep apnoea (28.7 (7.8) and 43.6 (5.0) mm) than in the snorers (23.7 (4.2) and 40.3 (4.9 mm). The MP-H was similar in snorers and age matched control subjects, but was significantly greater in the older than in the younger control subjects (22.1 (6.1) vs 17.0 (6.8]. The soft palate was longer in subjects who snored (both sleep apnoea patients and snorers) than in control subjects. The MP-H distance significantly correlated with age for all subjects (snorers and controls) and for the control subjects alone. This study shows that non-apnoeic snorers have cephalometric abnormalities that differ from those of patients with sleep apnoea and that cephalometric values are influenced by the subject's age.\r"

  ".W": "Many possible pulmonary complications of renal disease have been described, but little is known of their physiological importance or the effects on them of different forms of renal replacement therapy. Four groups were recruited, each containing 20 patients. The groups consisted of patients with chronic renal failure before dialysis (group 1); patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, never having received a transplant (group 2); patients receiving haemodialysis, never having received a transplant (group 3); and patients after their first successful cadaveric renal transplant (group 4). All were attending the same regional dialysis and transplant unit. None was known to have clinically important lung or chest wall disease. Flow-volume loops were recorded before and after 400 micrograms of salbutamol, and plethysmographic lung volumes and airway conductance and single breath carbon monoxide transfer factor were measured. Only nine of 80 patients had normal lung function. The reductions in spirometric values were minor. Whole lung carbon monoxide transfer factor was reduced in all groups (mean % predicted with 95% confidence intervals: group 1 81.7% (74-89%); group 2 69.7% (62-77%); group 3 87.5% (80-96%); group 4 82.5% (78-87%]. The values were significantly lower in those having continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (group 2). Residual volume was reduced significantly in the group who had undergone renal transplantation (85.7%, 77-94%). There was no correlation between these changes and smoking habit, age, duration or severity of renal failure, duration of treatment, or biochemical derangement. It is concluded that abnormal lung function is common in renal disease. The main change is a reduction in carbon monoxide transfer that persists after transplantation. The likeliest explanation is that subclinical pulmonary oedema progresses to fibrosis before transplantation. The fibrosis may worsen further to cause the reduced residual volume in the recipients of grafts.\r"

A man with bilateral pleural thickening and plaques developed acute pericarditis and an effusion and was treated by pericardiectomy. Two men died from constrictive pericarditis associated with bilateral pleural effusions and diffusion pleural thickening. The pericardium showed nonspecific fibrous thickening. All had been occupationally exposed to asbestos. In the fatal cases the lungs contained amphibole fibres, in keeping with a modest degree of occupational exposure. Asbestos produces progressive fibrosis of the pericardium that is similar to diffuse pleural thickening and may be fatal. Both conditions may develop after relatively short or light exposure.\r"

During bronchoconstriction, induced by a wide range of inhaled methacholine concentrations (0.5-256 g/l), the rise in Rrs6 was reflected by a fall in PtcO2 in all subjects. Although there was a significant mean fall in SaO2 at maximum bronchoconstriction there was no consistent relation between changes in SaO2 and Rrs6. The inhaled dose of methacholine causing a 40% increase in Rrs6 (PD40Rrs6) and a 20% fall in PtCO2 (PD20PtcO2) was calculated for each subject. There was no significant difference in mean PD40Rrs6 and PD20PtcO2, and the relation between the two was similar in the asthmatic children and the normal adults. It was therefore concluded that the measurement of PtcO2, but not SaO2, during methacholine challenge can be used for the assessment of bronchial responsiveness, and that it could prove particularly useful for children too young to cooperate with lung function tests.\r"

The mean annual decline in the ratio for each age group was as follows: 0-14 years 6.7% (95% confidence interval 4.00 to 9.6%), 15-34 years 1.4% (-0.2 to 3.0%), 35-54 years 4.5% (2.2 to 6.9%), 55-74 years 2.8% (1.8 to 3.7%), and 75+ years 3.2% (2.1 to 4.2%). Because the incidence of disease in the 75+ group has declined much more slowly than in the rest of the population and because the size of this age group has increased in relation to the other groups, the overall annual mortality from tuberculosis has declined by only 0.13% (95% CI -1.3 to 1.3%). The total number of deaths from tuberculosis declined from 996 in 1974 to 430 in 1987, whereas deaths in the 75+ age group remained relatively constant at around 200 a year.\r"

Eight healthy men were studied in a randomised, double blind placebo controlled cross-over study. A single dose of platelet activating factor that caused a fall of at least 35% in specific airways conductance (sGaw) was determined initially for each subject. Challenge with this dose of platelet activating factor was then carried out on two further occasions after pretreatment with a single nebulised dose of SK&F 104353-Z2 or placebo. The % reductions in specific airways conductance and of partial flow at 30% of vital capacity (PVmax30) were less after SK&F 104353-Z2 than after placebo (22 versus 34 for sGaw, 19 versus 31 for PVmax30). The mean (95% confidence limits (CL] differences in the maximum % fall from control values for SK&F 104353-Z2 and placebo were -12.6 (-23.8, -1.4) for sGaw and -12.5, (-20.8 -4.2) for PVmax30. The mean % fall in neutrophil count was similar after SK&F 104353-Z2 (46%) and after placebo (50%) (95% CL of difference 13.6, 6.6). Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine did not increase above baseline values in any subject when measured two weeks after challenge by platelet activating factor. This study suggests that leukotrienes play a part in the response to platelet activating factor in man.\r"

Neither the severity of chest radiographic abnormalities, the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (both measured before sputum induction), nor baseline SaO2 prospectively identified the patients who developed oxygen desaturation. Two patients, one with pneumocystis pneumonia, developed dyspnoea and had a fall in arterial oxygen saturation to 84% within 10 minutes of starting sputum induction. The procedure was abandoned in both patients and in two further patients, who developed severe nausea and reaching but no oxygen desaturation.

Travelers to these areas should carry three tablets of pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, which should be taken for presumptive treatment of malaria at the onset of chills and fever. It is essential that chemoprophylaxis be continued for four to five weeks after departure from endemic areas. In travelers who develop symptoms of malaria after returning from an endemic area, it is imperative that treatment be started even if blood smears are negative.\r"

The syndrome may cause weakness and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles and loss of sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution of the hand. The most common cause of ulnar tunnel syndrome is chronic occupational trauma, either from pressure exerted over the hypothenar eminence by a tool or from the use of the heel of the hand as a hammer. Nonoccupational etiologies include congenital, inflammatory, neoplastic, vascular, metabolic, degenerative and traumatic disorders. Diagnosis often requires neurophysiologic evaluation, in addition to a careful history and physical examination. Conservative treatment aimed at protecting the ulnar tunnel from trauma frequently is effective. Occasionally, surgical decompression of the ulnar tunnel is required.\r"

Approximately 80 percent of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome will develop pneumocystis pneumonia. Diagnosis is important, because effective therapy is available. In most cases, diagnosis can be made by sputum analysis. Bronchoalveolar lavage will yield a diagnosis in 85 to 90 percent of patients with pneumocystis pneumonia, and is used when sputum induction and analysis is unproductive, unavailable or negative. Transbronchial biopsy and, rarely, open lung biopsy will yield the etiology of pneumonia in the remaining patients. Pentamidine or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the treatment of choice. Toxicity often occurs, including hypoglycemia, nephrotoxicity, neutropenia and rash. Corticosteroids are helpful in moderate to severe disease. Mortality for the first episode of P. carinii pneumonia averages 20 percent. Prophylaxis effectively prevents and reduces the incidence of future episodes.\r"

Parenting practices that may encourage tantrums include inconsistency, unreasonable expectations, excessive strictness, overprotectiveness and overindulgence. Boredom, fatigue, hunger or illness may reduce the child's tolerance for frustration. Management consists of teaching the parents to understand the underlying meaning of tantrums and to modify parental behaviors that may perpetuate or accentuate the problem. Temper tantrums are best handled by ignoring the outburst, offering nurturance to the child after the tantrum has subsided and helping the child learn to express negative feelings in more acceptable ways.\r"

After successful PTCA 66 patients were treated with conventional therapy (group I), and 48 patients were treated with IABP for 25 +/- 8 hours (group II). The reocclusion rate was significantly lower in group II (2.4% vs 17.7% p less than 0.05). An increase in ejection fraction in group II compared with group I was marginally significant (4.5 +/- 12.2% vs 9.2 +/- 13.0%, p = 0.08). Vascular complications occurred in two patients, but there were no deaths from IABP. These results suggest that after successful PTCA for acute myocardial infarction, IABP prevents reocclusion and may add strength to reperfusion in the improvement of left ventricular function.\r"

The viability of myocardial tissue was assessed by exercise thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy, and the collateral circulation was angiographically evaluated by means of a collateral index ranging from 0 to 3. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (group 1, n = 10) or absence (group 2, n = 10) of viable myocardium in the perfusion territory of the infarct-related artery. The collateral index in group 1 was 2.5 +/- 0.5 (SD), which was significantly higher than the 0.7 +/- 0.8 in group 2. These findings indicate that the presence of ischemic but viable myocardium is intimately related to the development of collateral circulation in patients with myocardial infarction, and the existence of well-developed collateral channels predicts the presence of viable myocardium in the infarct area.\r"

Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (n = 17) or absence (n = 34) of restenosis defined as greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis at the dilated site. Baseline characteristics were comparable. The mean value for angina functional class at follow-up was significantly better in the group without than in the group with restenosis (0.4 +/- 0.6 vs 2.1 +/- 1.1, respectively; p less than 0.001). Sixty-five percent of the patients without restenosis were asymptomatic at follow-up. Seventy-five percent of the predicted maximal physical capacity was reached by 76% of the patients without restenosis compared with 33% in the group with restenosis (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In our series 31 patients underwent dilatation at either the site of anastomosis (24), the native coronary artery beyond the anastomosis (4), or both (3) with no mortality, myocardial infarction, or need for emergency coronary artery bypass surgery. Angiographic and clinical success was achieved in 28 patients (90%). There were two internal mammary artery dissections with both patients requiring elective coronary bypass surgery. Of the patients in whom dilatation was successful, 22 (79%) have been followed for longer than 6 months and 19 (86%) have had sustained functional improvement at a mean of 35 months after angioplasty. One patient is to undergo repeat coronary bypass surgery. No patient has had a myocardial infarction or died during follow-up. Although percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the internal mammary artery has inherent difficulties because of the anatomic characteristics of the vessel, it can be performed with a high degree of primary success and a low incidence of complications and can provide long-term clinical improvement.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the accuracy of exercise echocardiography is affected by the degree of effort during exercise, we examined 101 patients who had 6 months earlier undergone successful coronary artery angioplasty, with resting and immediate postexercise echocardiography and same-day coronary angiography. A positive exercise echocardiographic response was defined as the development of a new or worsening wall motion abnormality postexercise, compared with resting wall motion. Significant coronary disease (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) was present in 48 patients, 38 of whom had single-vessel disease and 10 of whom had two-vessel disease. Exercise echocardiography correctly identified 32 patients with significant disease (sensitivity 67%) and 44 patients without significant disease (specificity 83%). The effect of the degree of exercise effort on the sensitivity and specificity of the test was evaluated by three criteria; (1) the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate (MHR), (2) the duration of exercise (DUR), and (3) the double product (DP). To determine the influence of the degree of effort upon sensitivity and specificity, the effort criteria were compared between patients with true positive (TP) tests to those with false negative tests (FN), and in patients with true negative (TN) tests compared with those with false positive (FP) tests. No significant differences were detected in MHR, DUR, or DP between TP versus FN patients or between TN versus FP patients. These results indicate that for symptom-limited exercise echocardiography in postangioplasty patients, neither sensitivity nor specificity is significantly affected by the degree of effort during exercise.\r"

Risk was particularly associated with inhalation, the risk for inhalers being almost twice that of noninhalers. No difference in risk could be demonstrated between various types of tobacco (pipe, cigar/cheroots, or plain and filtered cigarettes). The risk seemed associated with current smoking only, inasmuch as the duration of the smoking habit was not important. Ex-smokers had the same risk as those who had never smoked regardless of duration of smoking and time elapsed since quitting. Relative excess risk was significantly higher in female smokers than in male smokers, and daily alcohol intake appeared to have some protective effect on the risk of first acute myocardial infarction among heavy smokers.\r"

In 39% of the patients difficulties in selectively cannulating the separate ostium of the circumflex artery and adequately opacifying this vessel resulted in a need to change the diagnostic catheter size. Recognition of this coronary anomaly is needed to ensure accurate angiographic interpretation and is important for patients undergoing cardiac surgery to selectively perfuse these separate vessels during cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

In the present study, we assessed whether heparin alone is effective in increasing treadmill capacity in 14 patients with effort angina. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: (1) group A--20 treadmill exercise periods with standard Bruce protocol twice a day for 10 days with heparin (5000 IU intravenously) pretreatment (seven patients) or (2) group B--10 injections of heparin calcium (10,000 IU subcutaneously) once a day for 10 days (seven patients). In group A, total exercise time was increased from 6.9 +/- 1.2 (SD) to 9.9 +/- 1.9 minutes (p less than 0.0005), as was the maximal double product, from 21,700 +/- 3,500 to 27,000 +/- 4,800 mm Hg/min (p less than 0.05). The double product at the onset of angina was also increased by 34% (p less than 0.05), and the double product at which ST depression (0.1 mV) first appeared was 22% (p less than 0.05) greater after treatment. In contrast, in group B, all of the above-mentioned parameters of treadmill capacity remained unchanged. These data indicate that heparin does not serve as an angiogenic factor by itself, but that it potentiates the ischemia-derived angiogenic factor.\r"

Following the shift, S values of 2n-1 form were always achieved by the occurrence of double ventricular ectopic rhythms in succession. Concealed trigeminy of 3n and 3n-2 form was seen in the other two patients. Double ventricular ectopic rhythms had bizarre abnormal QRS complexes of two different morphologies and were inscribed in opposite directions. Ectopic rhythms in each case had parasystolic characteristics. These observations suggest bifocal automaticity as a mechanism for bidirectional ventricular tachycardia.\r"

QRS duration, terminal QRS amplitude (root mean square [RMS]), and low-amplitude (less than 40 microV) signal (LAS) duration were determined by an automated algorithm from the vector magnitude of the QRS high-pass filtered at 25 Hz and at 40 Hz. Despite marked decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge (27 +/- 7 to 16 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and right atrial (13 +/- 7 to 7 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) pressures and a 20% increase in cardiac output, there was not a significant change in QRS duration, RMS, or LAS. Before and after therapy late potentials, defined as abnormal QRS duration RMS, or LAS, were present in 14 (52%) patients with filtering at 25 Hz and in 22 (81%) patients with filtering at 40 Hz. The signal-averaged ECG after hemodynamic improvement predicted the results during exacerbation of heart failure in all patients. Thus in patients with advanced heart failure the signal-averaged ECG obtained after hemodynamic improvement reflects the findings during exacerbation of heart failure.\r"

Therefore to estimate the frequency of clinically silent DVT, we performed ultrasound examinations of the leg veins in 29 asymptomatic CABG patients before hospital discharge. We used high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography with color Doppler imaging. Fourteen (48.3%, 95% confidence interval 30.1 to 66.4%) had 20 documented leg vein thromboses, and all but one patient had DVT limited to the calf veins. Of the 20 thrombi 10 (50.0%) were present in the leg ipsilateral and 10 (50.0%) in the leg contralateral to the saphenous vein harvest site. None of the DVTs were suspected clinically. DVT was not associated with any local sign attributed to saphenous vein harvest such as pitting edema, incisional drainage, or local tenderness or with any putative risk factor for DVT such as cigarette use, distant history of malignancy, or varicose veins. Follow-up of these patients 5 to 11 months after CABG surgery showed no clinical evidence of DVT or pulmonary embolism. Our findings indicate that asymptomatic DVT of the calf occurs with surprisingly high frequency, 44.8% after CABG surgery. Future studies in patients undergoing CABG surgery should address the natural history of asymptomatic DVT, determine its clinical importance, and develop optimal strategies for prophylaxis and treatment.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed the echocardiograms (two-dimensional Doppler and Doppler color flow imaging, or transesophageal with color flow imaging) obtained in seven patients with preoperative mitral regurgitation who had a prosthesis implanted with the native mitral leaflets left intact. Systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet, as seen in dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction, was observed in six of seven patients. LV fractional shortening preoperatively was less than or equal to 0.25 in all (mean 0.20 +/- 0.04) and did not significantly (p = ns) increase postoperatively (mean 0.27 +/- 0.12). Color flow imaging revealed disturbed systolic flow in the LV outflow tract in five patients, and all had systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet. Continuous wave Doppler detected significant systolic LV outflow tract jets in five patients averaging 4.1 +/- 0.9 m/sec. Mitral prosthetic function was normal (pressure half-time of 81 +/- 25 msec and mean gradient of 7 +/- 3 mm Hg +/- SD) in five patients. Clinical follow-up revealed that all had died, six of them within 2 months of their operation. Thus systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet occurs commonly after prosthetic mitral valve insertion with the native leaflets left intact. Continuous wave Doppler often demonstrates increased systolic LV outflow tract velocities consistent with dynamic LV outflow obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Multiple jets consistent with mitral regurgitation originating from the central and lateral portion of the prosthesis were found in all patients. Maximum jet length ranged from 11 to 51 mm (mean 21 +/- 9 mm). Maximum jet area ranged from 0.2 to 4.1 cm3 (mean 1.2 +/- 0.9 cm2). The color M-mode Doppler interrogation showed two distinct components of the regurgitant jet: brief early systolic flow consistent with valve closure followed by holosystolic regurgitant flow consistent with transvalvular leakage. Four patients (11%) had a maximum regurgitant jet length exceeding 30 mm and absence of early systolic closure regurgitant flow by M-mode color imaging, suggesting clinically silent paravalvular leakage. Two pin-sized paravalvular suture line defects were confirmed in one patient at cardiac transplantation. We conclude that transesophageal echocardiography is a highly sensitive method for detection of mitral regurgitation in the St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis. Clinically silent paravalvular leakage should be suspected if the maximum jet length exceeds 30 mm and color M-mode interrogation fails to demonstrate an early systolic closure regurgitant flow component.\r"

This study evaluated the ability of transesophageal echocardiography in the assessment of the 22 patients in whom aortic dissection was not found. A range of pathologic conditions was diagnosed in these patients. Five patients had ischemic heart disease when they were initially seen. Among the remaining 17 only one patient had a normal aorta. Aortic disease was present in the other 16 patients with aortic dilatation in 10. Atheromas were detected in seven patients with concomitant aortic dilatation in five of them. An extrinsic aortic mass was present in two patients. Transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified an anastomotic leak at the site of left coronary artery implantation in a patient with a recent Bentall procedure, and a large mobile clot within the proximal descending aorta in a patient with blunt chest trauma. These findings obviated the need for other tests in 15 patients and led to surgery in four with no ancillary tests performed in three of them. Thus transesophageal echocardiography has an important role in assessing patients with suspected dissection. Aortic disease is common even in patients in whom aortic dissection is excluded, and some of the conditions can be just as life-threatening as dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography not only reliably identifies dissection but can also detect luminal and extraluminal diseases not adequately visualized by other modalities.\r"

Several methods of assessment of ASD size, namely, echographic, pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (Qp:Qs), and angiographic measures, were undertaken in a group of 16 patients, aged 7 months to 45 years (median, 4.5 years), who were being evaluated for transcatheter closure of ASD; the results were compared with the stretched diameter. Although the echographic size of the ASD (9.9 +/- 4.1 mm, mean +/- SD) is similar (p greater than 0.1) to the angiographic size (7.9 +/- 2.5 mm), it is much smaller (p less than 0.01) than the stretched diameter (16.1 +/- 5.3 mm). When the relationship between various measures of ASD was examined, although the Qp:Qs ratio and angiographic size have a significant (p less than 0.05) correlation with the stretched diameter (r = 0.55 and 0.54, respectively), the echo diameter has the best correlation coefficient, r = 0.82, p less than 0.001. The stretched diameter can be estimated by the equation: 1.05 x echo + 5.49 mm. It is concluded that the echographic diameter is a useful adjunct in the estimation of the stretch ASD diameter, which in turn can be used in the selection of the size of the device for transcatheter occlusion of the ASD.\r"

Each subject performed three treadmill tests (Bruce, Balke, and ramp) and three bicycle ergometer tests (50 W/stage, 25 W/stage, and ramp) in random order. The ventilatory threshold was determined for each of the six exercise tests by three independent, blinded reviewers by means of graphic plots of three commonly used methods of determination: (1) changes in the ventilatory equivalents for VO2 and VCO2, (2) changes in end-tidal oxygen and carbon dioxide pressures, and (3) the intersection of the slope of VCO2 and VO2 (V slope). The largest variability in the ATge was observed with changes in the exercise protocol. The greatest absolute (ml/min) and percentage differences in oxygen uptake at the ATge as a result of changes in protocol, method of determination, and observers were 336 (36%), 125 (12%), and 70 (7%), respectively. The overall intraclass correlation coefficient for VO2 at the ATge among the three reviewers was 0.60 and among the three protocols was 0.85 (p less than 0.01). The V slope method of detection had consistently good agreement among reviewers and was least affected by the protocol. The variance in the ATge (excluding intersubject and error variance) accounted for by differences in protocol, method, and reviewer was 82%, 14%, and 4%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

CHF was fatal in less than 1 month in five patients (two had shown some initial improvement). The other 20 had sustained improvement by at least one functional class, interrupted by episodes of CHF that usually responded to intravenous therapy. Median survival was 12 months (range 10 days to greater than 3 years); five patients died suddenly, 12 died of intractable CHF, and two died of other causes. Six patients were alive 3 years after the onset of treatment with pimobendan. Add-on therapy with pimobendan produced a sustained improvement in many patients with severe CHF that was no longer responding to a combination of digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.\r"

Glycolysis was assayed in terms of the release of tritiated water from [5-3H] glucose, a measure of the rate through the aldolase step. It was found that 5 mmol/L F-1,6-P2 reduced the glycolytic rate parallel to the decrease in oxygen consumption. The results suggest that the cardioprotective action of F-1,6-P2 is related to a substrate effect and a decrease in adenosine triphosphate consumption as indicated by a decrease in oxygen consumption in accordance with the recent demonstration of Ca2+ binding by F-1,6-P2.\r"

Cardiac output was elevated (4.50 +/- 1.13 L/min versus 3.94 +/- 1.12 L/min, p less than 0.05) in patients with isolated systolic hypertension in comparison with values in normal elderly subjects. Systemic vascular resistance did not differ between both groups (2140 +/- 536 dyn.sec/cm-5 versus 2011 +/- 553 dyn.sec/cm-5, p = NS). The mean acceleration of blood during left ventricular ejection was similar in patients with isolated systolic hypertension in comparison with normals (12.6 +/- 5.6 m/sec2 versus 11.5 +/- 3.5 m/sec2, p = NS). Patients with isolated systolic hypertension had significantly decreased arterial compliance, as measured by the stroke volume-to-pulse pressure ratio (0.77 +/- 0.26 cm3/mm Hg versus 1.11 +/- 0.30 cm3/mm Hg, p less than 0.0001). The prevalence of aortic and mitral regurgitation as well as valvular and annular calcification did not differ between analyzed groups. Isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients appears to be multifactorial, with reduced arterial compliance and increased cardiac output both playing a role.\r"

Recent estimates suggest that in the United States as many as 5000 patients per year may have cardiac complications resulting from HIV infection. Patients with AIDS may have pericardial, myocardial, and/or endocardial disease. Pericardial tamponade and/or constriction may be related to neoplasms, infections, or nonspecific effusions. Myocardial dysfunction may result from specific neoplastic infiltration or myocarditis. Particularly intriguing is the role of HIV-1 in the nonspecific myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs in patients with AIDS. As in other debilitating conditions patients with AIDS can have nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. Infective endocarditis may be a complication, especially in AIDS associated with intravenous drug abuse. Most patients with AIDS have no overt clinical evidence of cardiac disease. When cardiac dysfunction does develop, the signs and symptoms are often misinterpreted to be the result of noncardiac causes (pulmonary failure or infection) which can mimic heart failure. This review is intended to alert the reader to the cardiac manifestations of AIDS, which present a number of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.\r"

The results indicate that myocardial infarction has a significant influence on fibrinolytic activity and that impaired fibrinolysis is more frequent in patients who have had a myocardial infarction than in healthy control subjects. Prospective cohort studies indicate that tests for global fibrinolytic activity are not of prognostic value for first or recurrent myocardial infarction. However, high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor and low levels of tissue plasminogen activator activity were associated with an increased risk of reinfarction in survivors of a first myocardial infarction. Whether this relationship between impaired fibrinolysis and reinfarction is causal or coincidental is unclear. There is evidence that impairment of fibrinolytic activity is more marked in patients with myocardial infarction who have minimal coronary atherosclerosis than in those who have marked atherosclerosis, suggesting that impaired fibrinolytic activity might be of pathogenetic importance in this small subgroup of patients.\r"

  ".W": "A pilot study was performed to determine the safety and efficacy of coronary pulsed mid-infra-red laser angioplasty. The laser was coupled with a novel 2.0 mm multifiber catheter consisting of 37 optical fibers of 150 microns each arranged concentrically around a 0.018-inch central lumen and a soft leading tapered distal tip to maintain coaxial alignment and position plaque in front of fibers. The laser was operated at 500 millijoules/pulse, 3.5 Hz, and 250 microseconds/pulse. Twenty-three patients with stenosis or occlusion of the left anterior descending or right coronary artery were selected for laser treatment. In three patients the catheter could not be positioned against the obstruction. In the 20 remaining patients laser angioplasty increased the diameter of the lumen from 0.3 +/- 0.3 mm to 1.4 +/- 0.3 mm and reduced the stenosis from 91 +/- 8% to 57 +/- 10%. In three patients \"stand-alone\" laser treatment was sufficient. In 17 patients balloon dilatation further reduced the stenosis to 20 +/- 18%. In two patients who had previously undergone unsuccessful balloon angioplasty with high inflation pressure, laser angioplasty allowed subsequent successful dilatation with low inflation pressure. There were no deaths, perforations, dissections, or arrhythmias. One patient had abrupt reclosure 24 hours after the procedure. Spasm occurred in four patients, and six patients had chest sensations during laser emission. Thus mid-infra-red pulsed coronary laser angioplasty is safe and effective for recanalization of stenosed and totally occluded arteries. The efficacy may be sufficient for \"stand-alone\" laser treatment. The technique may improve the efficacy of balloon angioplasty in cases of unsuccessful primary dilatation.\r"

Previous biplane probes suffered from inferior images because of reduced scan elements. We evaluated the utility of a prototype 48 X 48 element biplane transesophageal probe in 23 consecutive patients. Examinations were well tolerated with no side effects. In comparison to the single transverse plane, imaging with the longitudinal plane gave superior information on prosthetic valve pathology, atrial septal abnormalities, and pathoanatomy of the ascending aorta and mitral valve. Complementary information was provided by the longitudinal plane in patients with endocarditis and vegetations and in mitral protheses. Images obtained with this 48 X 48 element biplane probe along with color and spectral Doppler information were not perceptibly inferior to those obtained by single-plane probes. In conclusion, biplane transesophageal echocardiography with a 48 X 48 element probe indicates a great potential for enhanced three-dimensional understanding of cardiac pathology and diagnostic yield in specific pathologies.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of glutamate on anginal threshold, cardiac metabolism and hemodynamics were studied in 11 patients with stable angina pectoris, positive stress test results, and pacing-induced myocardial lactate release due to coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 9) or syndrome X (n = 2). Data were obtained before, during and after 2 identical periods of coronary sinus pacing, the second being preceded by an intravenous injection of monosodium glutamate 1.2 (n = 7) or 2.5 (n = 4) mg/kg body weight. After glutamate administration, pacing time to onset of angina increased from mean +/- standard deviation 103 +/- 53 to 166 +/- 71 seconds (p less than 0.01) and ST-segment depression after pacing decreased from 2.3 +/- 1.0 to 1.6 +/- 1.1 mm (p less than 0.01). Arterial glutamate concentration increased 60% (p less than 0.01) after the low dose and 150% (p less than 0.01) after the high dose of glutamate. Regardless of dose, myocardial glutamate uptake increased by 25% (p less than 0.01). Pacing-induced cardiac release of lactate diminished 50% (p less than 0.05), whereas the releases of xanthine and hypoxanthine were unchanged by glutamate. Arterial free fatty acids decreased 20% (p less than 0.01). Circulating levels and cardiac exchanges of alanine, glucose and citrate were unchanged. Glutamate did not influence heart rate, arterial blood pressure, coronary blood flow, coronary vascular resistance or myocardial oxygen consumption. One patient complained of short-lasting burning sensations after receiving the high glutamate dose. In conclusion, augmented provision of glutamate enhances pacing tolerance in stable angina, presumably by a metabolic improvement of cardiac energy production during ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "In this open multicenter study, 156 patients with acute myocardial infarction received 30 U of anistreplase intravenously over 5 minutes within 4 hours of the onset of chest pain. The patency of the infarct-related vessel was determined by coronary angiography 90 minutes after anistreplase treatment, and also 24 hours after treatment, in patients with a patent infarct-related vessel at 90 minutes, to assess the reocclusion rate. The investigators categorized the infarct-related vessel as patent or occluded, and 2 independent cardiologists graded the infarct-related vessel according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) perfusion criteria. At the 90-minute assessment, 106 of 145 evaluable patients (73%) had patent infarct-related vessels, and 39 of 145 (27%) had occluded infarct-related vessels. Of the 139 independently assessed patients, 98 (71%) had TIMI grades 2 or 3 and 41 (29%) had TIMI grades 0 or 1. At the 24-hour assessment, 98 of 102 patients (96%) had a patent infarct-related vessel, and reocclusion had occurred in 4 of 102 patients (4%). Of the 94 independently assessed patients 90 (96%) had TIMI grades 2 or 3, and 4 (4%) had TIMI grades 0 or 1. The reliability of noninvasive parameters as indicators of achieved patency of the infarct-related vessel was estimated by means of correlation with patency assessed by coronary angiography. A significant correlation of 0.62 was found. The patency rate of 71 to 73% after use of anistreplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction corresponds with findings in earlier studies. The low reocclusion rate of 4% after use of anistreplase probably reflects the prolonged action of anistreplase.\r"

Mean New York Heart Association functional class was 1.6 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- standard deviation). Aortic systolic pressure (p less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased (10 +/- 3 to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly (p less than 0.001), whereas pulmonary and right atrial pressure and pulmonary arteriolar resistance did not change. Cardiac and stroke indexes showed biphasic changes. Although positive and negative maximal rate of left ventricular pressures decreased significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively), they did not change significantly when aortic systolic pressure was corrected. There was a significant inverse correlation between the negative rate of left ventricular pressure/aortic systolic pressure before nicardipine infusion and its maximal percent increase after infusion (r = -0.56, p less than 0.05), indicating a beneficial effect on diastolic relaxation in patients with impaired diastolic function. Our data show that a low dose (10 micrograms/kg) of intravenous nicardipine exerts a favorable effect on impaired diastolic function, but depresses left ventricular pump function with much less effect on right heart circulation.\r"

Baseline diltiazem data were obtained during a 2-week period, after which 86 patients were randomized to bepridil (n = 46) or diltiazem (n = 40). Angina frequency, nitroglycerin consumption and ischemic manifestations induced by exercise treadmill testing were evaluated over 8 weeks. Bepridil significantly (p less than 0.05) increased time to angina onset, time to 1 and 2 mm of ST-segment depression, total exercise time and total work over baseline values. Changes in time to angina onset and time to 1 mm of ST-segment depression were significantly (p less than 0.05) greater for bepridil than for diltiazem. Angina frequency and nitroglycerin consumption did not differ significantly between groups. Compared with baseline, bepridil significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased heart rate (mean 4 beats/min) and prolonged QTc (mean 35 ms). The most frequent adverse effects in both groups were nausea, asthenia, dizziness, headache and diarrhea. Four patients taking bepridil and 1 taking diltiazem withdrew from the study because of adverse reactions. No sudden deaths, myocardial infarctions or instances of sustained ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes occurred in either group. The data indicate that bepridil provided safe and effective antianginal and antiischemic therapy in patients with chronic stable angina who exhibited less than optimal response to maximal tolerated doses of diltiazem.\r"

Procedural results were compared with 8,117 consecutive procedures in patients with ejection fractions greater than 40%. The patients with LV dysfunction were older (63 vs 60 years, p less than 0.01), had a greater incidence of prior myocardial infarction (84 vs 45%, p less than 0.001), prior bypass surgery (39 vs 21%, p less than 0.001), 3-vessel disease (62 vs 33%, p less than 0.001), and class IV angina (48 vs 41%, p less than 0.01) than the control group. Angiographic success was lower (93 vs 95%, p less than 0.01), and overall procedural mortality was increased ( 4 vs 1%, p less than 0.001) in the study group. Emergency surgery rates were identical (2%). No significant difference was found in rates of nonfatal Q-wave myocardial infarction (2 vs 1%). At mean follow-up of 33.5 months, 15% of the patients with LV dysfunction required late bypass surgery, 27% underwent repeat PTCA, and 59% were angina free. Actuarial survival at 1 and 4 years was 87 and 69%, respectively. Cox regression analysis identified 3-vessel disease, age greater than or equal to 70 years, class IV angina and incomplete revascularization as correlates of long-term mortality. These data suggest that PTCA may be an effective treatment for coronary artery disease in patients with LV dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Although quantitation of exercise thallium tomograms has enhanced the noninvasive diagnosis and localization of coronary artery disease, the detection of stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery remains suboptimal. Because posterolateral regional wall motion during exercise is well assessed by radionuclide angiography, this study determined whether regional dysfunction of the posterolateral wall during exercise radionuclide angiography is more sensitive in identifying left circumflex disease than thallium perfusion abnormalities assessed by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). One hundred ten consecutive patients with CAD were studied, of whom 70 had a significant stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery or a major obtuse marginal branch. Both regional function and segmental thallium activity of the posterolateral wall were assessed using visual and quantitative analysis. Left ventricular regional function was assessed objectively by dividing the left ventricular region of interest into 20 sectors; the 8 sectors corresponding to the posterolateral free wall were used to assess function in the left circumflex artery distribution. Similarly, using circumferential profile analysis of short-axis thallium tomograms, left ventricular myocardial activity was subdivided into 64 sectors; the 16 sectors corresponding to the posterolateral region were used to assess thallium perfusion abnormalities in the left circumflex artery territory. Qualitative posterolateral wall motion analysis detected 76% of patients with left circumflex coronary artery stenosis, with a specificity of 83%, compared with only 44% by qualitative thallium tomography (p less than 0.001) and a specificity of 92%. Whereas quantitation of thallium activity increased the sensitivity for detecting left circumflex coronary artery stenosis to 80% with a specificity of 55%, it did not achieve statistical significance when compared with qualitative wall motion analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial stunning (postischemic ventricular dysfunction) occurs in dogs after coronary stenosis following treadmill exercise. Less data are available in humans regarding development of stunned myocardium after exercise. Regional wall motion changes were evaluated in 22 patients with known coronary artery disease using 2-dimensional echocardiography and exercise treadmill testing. Wall motion was scored as 1 = normal, 2 = hypokinetic, 3 = akinetic, 4 = dyskinetic. At least 1 left ventricular segment with normal resting function developed an increase in wall motion score at 15 or 30 minutes compared with values at rest. The wall motion score in the midportion of the ventricular septum increased from 1.0 at rest to 1.6 (p less than 0.004) at 30 minutes after exercise; the basal inferior wall score worsened from 1.0 at rest to 1.9 (p less than 0.01) at 30 minutes after exercise. Coronary angiographic data in these patients revealed that left anterior descending narrowing correlated best with left ventricular septal wall motion abnormalities, whereas right coronary artery and circumflex narrowing best correlated with inferior and posterior wall motion abnormalities. Eight normal adult volunteers with no history of myocardial ischemia also underwent 2-dimensional echocardiography and exercise testing. No wall motion abnormalities were observed at any time after exercise. The present study suggests that in patients with coronary artery disease, exercise treadmill testing may induce regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle that persist greater than or equal to 30 minutes after exercise, an observation consistent with the phenomenon of stunned myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the antiarrhythmic effect of reflex-induced vagal activation, phenylephrine was infused in 17 patients with frequent ventricular premature complexes (VPCs). The role of heart rate reduction in suppressing VPCs was explored by pacing the atria at the preinfusion levels. Baroreceptor activation was considered effective when a greater than or equal to 20% decrease in heart rate was observed. Ten patients (59%) achieved the target heart rate decrease (-29 +/- 5%), whereas in 7 (41%) the baroreceptor reflex was considered inadequate. In the former group (\"responders\"), heart rate decreased from 73 +/- 7 to 52 +/- 6 beats/min (p less than 0.0001). When heart rate was allowed to fluctuate, ectopic activity was completely abolished in 9 of 10 patients; mean number of VPCs decreased from 38 +/- 8 to 0.2 +/- 0.6/100 beats (p less than 0.0001). During pacing, VPCs reappeared but their mean number (22 +/- 10/100 beats) was still significantly reduced compared with control values (p = 0.003). In the \"nonresponders,\" despite adequate blood pressure increases, VPC frequency was not affected. The QT interval lengthened during phenylephrine (392 +/- 17 ms) versus control conditions (372 +/- 18 ms, p = 0.0008) in the responders group, whereas no change was observed in the nonresponders. These results demonstrate that reflex vagal activation markedly reduces VPCs. This effect is only partially rate-dependent; direct and indirect electrophysiologic changes secondary to baroreflex activation are also likely to be involved.\r"

Heart failure was due to coronary artery disease in 23 patients (group I) and to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 16 (group II). LV shape was quantitated based on the ratio of LV major-to-minor axis and LV sphericity index calculated at end-systole and end-diastole. In group I, 9 patients had angiographic evidence of MR and 14 did not. In group II, 10 patients had MR and 6 did not. Within each group, there were no differences between patients with and without MR with regard to LV chamber volume and regional segmental wall motion abnormalities. In both groups, however, a significant difference was observed between patients with and without MR with respect to end-systolic and end-diastolic LV shape indexes. In group I, the end-systolic major-to-minor axis ratio was lower in patients with (1.42 +/- 0.04) than without (1.72 +/- 0.05) MR (p less than 0.001). Similar differences were observed in group II (1.41 +/- 0.06 vs 1.69 +/- 0.04) (p less than 0.01).

Similar differences were observed in group II (0.37 +/- 0.03 vs 0.26 +/- 0.01) (p less than 0.02).

Significant atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias, or both, were detected on presentation or during follow-up in 24 patients. Arrhythmias were present in only 8 of 51 survivors (16%) but were detected in 16 of 30 patients (53%) who died (p less than 0.05). Patients dying suddenly were even more likely to have had documented dysrhythmias (8 of 11, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular shortening fraction was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors (14.9 +/- 1.0% vs 15.3 +/- 1.7%). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in 44 patients who had cardiac catheterization averaged 20.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in patients who died than in those who survived (29.5 +/- 2.2 vs 15.0 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Analysis of actuarial survival revealed that mortality was highest during the first 6 months after presentation (19% mortality). Survival declined more gradually thereafter and was 70% at 2 years, 64% at 5 years and 52% after 11.5 years. Age at initial presentation did not have any significant impact on survival. However, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 25 torr was associated with a significantly increased mortality rate (p less than 0.05). Early cardiac transplantation should be considered in patients with markedly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or complex atrial or ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

All patients received a regimen of prednisone, 1.0 mg/kg/day, and azathioprine, 1.5 mg/kg/day, followed by repeat endomyocardial biopsy and reevaluation of LV function. LV function improved significantly in the group with borderline myocarditis, as assessed by LV stroke work--end-diastolic volume ratio (0.26 +/- 0.17 to 0.54 +/- 0.31 kg.m.ml-1, p less than 0.02), heart rate corrected velocity of circumferential shortening (0.49 +/- 0.30 to 0.80 +/- 0.29 circ.s-1, p less than 0.05), and LV ejection fraction (0.30 +/- 0.15 to 0.47 +/- 0.13, p less than 0.05).

No significant change in these indexes of LV function or volume occurred in the myocarditis group. Whereas salutory improvements in cardiac output and filling pressures were found in both groups, objective improvement in LV function assessed by complementary indexes of contractility was greatest in the borderline myocarditis group. It is concluded that short-term immunosuppressive therapy improves LV contractile function and appears to be associated with regression of ventricular dilatation in patients with borderline myocarditis to a greater extent than patients with myocarditis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No patient had concomitant disorders known to affect diastolic function. All patients had normal systolic function. LV wall thickness and internal dimension were measured in order to calculate LV mass. Fifty percent of morbidly obese patients had LV diastolic filling abnormalities as assessed by the presence of greater than or equal to 2 abnormal variables of mitral inflow velocity. The ratio of peak early to peak late (atrial) filling velocity was significantly decreased in obese compared with control patients (1.16 +/- 0.26 vs 1.66 +/- 0.30, p less than 0.001). The peak velocity of early LV diastolic filling was significantly reduced in obese patients (75 +/- 15 vs 98 +/- 19 cm/s, p less than 0.001). The atrial contribution to stroke velocity as assessed by the time-velocity integral of late compared with total LV diastolic filling was significantly increased in obese patients (36 +/- 7 vs 27 +/- 4%, p less than 0.001).

However, increased LV mass did not correlate with indexes of abnormal diastolic filling in obese patients. These data suggest that abnormalities of diastolic function occur frequently in asymptomatic morbidly obese patients and may represent a subclinical form of cardiomyopathy in the obese patient.\r"

Twenty-two individuals (8%) overestimated and 29 (11%) were accurate to within 419 kJ (100 kcal) of their maintenance requirement. The remaining 215 individuals (81%) reported their habitual intake at 2930 +/- 1586 kJ (700 +/- 379 kcal) below that subsequently determined as their maintenance requirement. These findings suggest caution in the interpretation of food-consumption data.\r"

Infants less than 2500 g in birth weight were studied while less than 24 h old and at 4-7 d of age. TBW (n = 32) was measured by H2(18)O dilution and ECW (n = 34), by bromide dilution. Measurements were made by using an impedance plethysmograph from each of four electrode pairs. Bioelectrical resistance correlated inversely with TBW (r = -0.683). When body weight and crown-heel length were factored into the equation, the correlation improved (r = 0.953). Bioelectrical reactance correlated inversely with ECW (r = -0.707). When body weight and surface area were factored into the equation the correlation improved (r = 0.882). We conclude that bioelectrical resistance and reactance are good indices of TBW and ECW, respectively. However, the ability to resolve small changes in body-water compartments when confined to the intraluminal or other third spaces remains questionable, particularly for single subjects.\r"

Total body weight, lean body weight, and fat weight were measured at the end of the HF and LF dietary periods by hydrostatic weighing. Despite adjustments in energy intake to maintain weight throughout the study, subjects exhibited a 2.8% decrease in total body weight (P less than 0.0006), an 11.3% decrease in fat weight (P less than 0.0001), and a 2.2% increase in lean body weight (P less than 0.0149) by the end of the LF period. Similar changes were observed in obese (BMI greater than 30) and non-obese women (BMI less than 30). By the end of the LF period, energy intake had increased significantly in comparison with the HF diet (119% of the HF intake, P less than 0.0001).

HIV-infected patients had 8% (P less than 0.05) higher rates of resting energy expenditure than did control subjects. Fat-oxidation rates were significantly higher in the patients (means +/- SE: 2.90 +/- 0.08 vs 2.19 +/- 0.17 g.kg FFM-1.d-1, patients vs control subjects, P less than 0.01) whereas no significant differences in carbohydrate-oxidation rates between patients and control subjects were found. These alterations in metabolism were not associated with increased concentrations of catecholamines, cortisol, or thyroid hormones. Mean concentrations of interleukin 6 in the patients were increased only twofold when compared with healthy control subjects. The results indicate that HIV infection affects host metabolism in the early asymptomatic stage, before CD4+ T cell numbers start to decline.\r"

The 30 children who completed these tests successfully were classified as nontasters or tasters based on their PROP thresholds as well as their suprathreshold PROP functions. Analysis of variance showed significant differences in acceptance of cheese and milk for the two taste groups on one of the three preference tasks, selection of foods in order of preference. Tasters selected cheese later than did nontasters, suggesting that they like it less. Tasters selected milk earlier than did nontasters, suggesting that they like it more.\r"

Percentages of fatty acids in adipose tissue were significantly correlated with the percentage of total fat intake for polyunsaturated fatty acids (Spearman correlation = 0.37), n-3 fatty acids of marine origin (Spearman correlation = 0.48), and trans fatty acids (Spearman correlation = 0.51) but not for saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Correlations were somewhat stronger in 78 women with stable weight over the 6 mo before fat aspiration. These data suggest that intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including n-3 fatty acids, and trans fatty acids are reflected in the adipose tissue but that intakes of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids are not. The data also provide further support for the validity of the food-frequency questionnaire in the assessment of fat intake.\r"

In another study, animals fed the 10% MO or the 10% SO diet for 5 wk were subjected to subcutaneous methotrexate injections for 3 consecutive days. Feeding rats a diet containing large amounts of menhaden oil resulted in lower prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 synthesis and lower sucrase activities. Indicators of mucosal mass after methotrexate-induced injury were significantly improved in both the jejunum and ileum at 3 and 10 d after methotrexate administration. Our data suggest that dietary menhaden oil stimulates mucosal regeneration after methotrexate-induced injury.\r"

Compared with 1984 data, we found essentially no change in 1989 for the per capita availability of trans fatty acids from total food service fats and oils. The 1989 value we obtained for industrial fats and oils is somewhat higher than the value we reported for 1984, in part because more complete data were available for 1989. In contrast, however, since 1984 the per capita availability of trans fatty acids from household salad and cooking oils, household shortenings, and all margarines and spreads (retail, food service, and industrial) has decreased. Overall, our reassessed (1989) value for total trans fatty acid availability is 8.1 g.person-1.d-1, which is similar to our original estimate. This total may increase slightly (approximately 0.3 g.person-1.d-1) as a result of the recent switch by many establishments from the use of tallow to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for frying.\r"

  ".W": "The upper range of the requirement for methionine plus cystine in healthy adults was proposed in 1985 by FAO/WHO/UNU to be 13 mg.kg body wt-1.d-1. To explore the validity of this estimate, five healthy, young adult men were given for 7 d a diet based on an L-amino acid mixture supplying 13 mg methionine.kg-1.d-1 (87 mumol.kg-1.d-1) without cystine. Constant intravenous infusions of L-[2H3-methyl-1-13C]methionine were given on days 5 and 7 while subjects were in the fed and postabsorptive states, respectively. Estimates were made of methionine oxidation, and daily methionine balance was derived from the intake-oxidation data. For the five subjects, methionine balances were -0.9, +0.7, +3.5, -3.1, and -3.8 mg kg-1.d-1, or -6, +5, +23, -21, and -26 mumol.kg-1.d-1. These findings lead to the conclusion that the upper range of the requirement for methionine plus cystine probably exceeds 13 mg.kg-1.d-1 in healthy young adults. The implications of this conclusion for establishing an appropriate amount of sulfur amino acids in an amino acid requirement pattern for adults is discussed.\r"

Four groups of four subjects each were given a control diet, based on an L-amino acid mixture supplying 29.5 and 21.9 mg.kg-1.d-1 of L-methionine and L-cystine for 4 d before the tracer study, conducted on day 5 during the fed state. Two groups received the control diet and two groups received the betaine supplement. Tracer was given intravenously (iv) or orally. The transmethylation rate of MET (TM), homocysteine remethylation (RM), and oxidation of methionine were estimated from plasma methionine labeling and 13C enrichment of expired air. RM tended to increase (P = 0.14) but the TM and methionine oxidation were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher after betaine supplementation when estimated with the oral tracer. No differences were detected with the intravenous tracer. Methionine concentration in plasma obtained from blood taken from subjects in the fed state was higher (P less than 0.01) with betaine supplementation. These results suggest that excess methyl-group intake may increase the dietary requirement for methionine.\r"

Also, [2H3]leucine was added to the diet. Leucine oxidation was similar for all diet groups in the fasted state. During the fed state, leucine oxidation was not affected by the Val:Ile pattern.

Burn patients, compared with normal individuals, demonstrated a doubling in proline and leucine flux (P less than 0.01 for both findings), a threefold enhancement of proline oxidation (P less than 0.05), a trend toward decreased proline synthesis, and a 37% reduction in plasma proline concentrations (P less than 0.05). Further, the injured group, unlike the control group, was in a distinct negative body proline balance, as proline oxidation greatly exceeded endogenous proline biosynthesis (P less than 0.01). These studies indicate that significant proline deficits may evolve during the postabsorptive period in severely burned patients and that an exogenous supply of proline might benefit the nitrogen economy of the traumatized patient.\r"

Similar regression curves were also obtained for soluble DF (SDF) and insoluble DF (IDF). The two regression curves indicated that the correlation coefficient between observed GI and GI calculated from the IDF regression curve (-0.781) was virtually identical to that for SDF (-0.780), but a given content (eg, 5% vs available carbohydrate) of SDF gave a lower GI (39) than did IDF (48). This stronger dependency of GI on SDF suggests a major function of SDF in the TDF hypoglycemic effect. From the regression curve of GI vs TDF, we propose a supplemental GI to predict the glycemic response to foods with no published GI.\r"

Groups A, B, and C were fed 100%, 60%, and 20%, respectively, of the recommended amounts of calcium and phosphorus that, when adjusted for rates of growth, approximated the range of dietary intakes of preterm infants. Group C manifested biochemical and body-composition evidence of mineral deficiency when compared with group A: lower serum phosphorus; higher serum alkaline phosphatase activity; less fat-free tissue, calcium, and phosphorus in tibiae, vertebrae, and whole carcasses. Neonatal miniature piglets are useful for studying mineral deposition during mineral deficiency in preterm infants.\r"

Calcium intake was determined from the mean of 4-d, food-intake records. Average vertebral bone mineral density from L1-L4 was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry. A multiple-regression model revealed that 81% of the variance in V-BMD was described by maturational age, chronological age, and calcium intake, with all representing significant predictors of bone mineral density (P less than 0.0001, 0.005, 0.04, respectively).

It is now known to occur in children and adolescents from widely diverse areas including Egypt, Iran, Turkey, China, Yugoslavia, Canada, and the United States; and among pregnant women from Iran, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States. Major manifestations include retarded growth and development and an increased incidence of pregnancy complications. Other manifestations may include suppressed immunity, poor healing, dermatitis, and impairments in neuropsychological functions. Precise information as to the numbers of people affected by dietary zinc deficiency is not available.

Such infections in infants are often not diagnosed during the acute phase. Late sequelae of reflux nephropathy include hypertension, proteinuria, or chronic renal failure. The latter may eventuate in the subset of patients with urinary tract infection and unilateral reflux extending to a solitary kidney or bilateral reflux. Proteinuria may herald the inexorable progression of glomerular sclerosis in patients destined to progress to end-stage renal disease, despite the absence of further recurrences of urinary tract infections. The mechanism of progression is probably similar to that occurring in other forms of chronic, diffuse parenchymal renal disease, which all have similar alterations in glomerular hemodynamics (an increase in glomerular capillary flow, pressure, and filtration). The consequent hyperfiltration per nephron may be related to the level of dietary protein intake or to some derivative of the protein load. Hyperfiltration appears to recapitulate the presumed renal hemodynamic response to the relatively high level of episodic meat consumption by paleolithic hunter-gatherers. A prudent therapeutic intervention in children with progressive reflux nephropathy may be a proportional reduction in protein intake.\r"

The hypocalcemia resolved in 1 week, 3 months, and 14 months in the three patients. The recurrences of hypocalcemia occurred at 4, 7, and 12 years of age. Their plasma parathyroid hormone concentrations were consistently low but detectable. We suggest that partial hypoparathyroidism is the underlying abnormality in these patients and that neonatal hypocalcemia in otherwise healthy infants indicates the need for calcium measurements during childhood and adolescence.\r"

A clinic-based program was designed to encourage early book use among parents of children at risk. It included (1) waiting room readers, (2) guidance about literacy development, and (3) provision of children's books at each visit. Seventy-nine parents of children aged 6 to 60 months were interviewed. Parents who had previously received a book were more likely to report looking at books with their children or that looking at books was a favorite activity (adjusted odds ratio, 4.05). This association was strongest among parents receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children (odds ratio, 7.8). This preliminary study suggests that pediatricians can play a role in enriching children's early literacy environments, especially for children at high risk of school failure.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the immunologic potential of infants 7 to 15 months of age to respond to Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine following immunization with H influenzae b oligosaccharide-CRM197 conjugate vaccine. STUDY DESIGN. One hundred seventy-one infants, aged 7 to 15 months, were consecutively and alternatively assigned to one of three immunization protocols. Group 1 (n = 71) received three doses of H influenzae b oligosaccharide-CRM197 conjugate vaccine, group 2 (n = 47) received two doses of H influenzae b oligosaccharide-CRM197 conjugate vaccine followed by one dose of H influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine, and group 3 received one dose of H influenzae b oligosaccharide-CRM197 conjugate vaccine followed by two doses of H influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine. Immunizations were given on day 0 and at 2 months and 6 months. Anti-H influenzae type b polysaccharide antibody levels were measured on day 0 and 2, 3, 6, 7, and 12 months after the study began. RESULTS. Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine given as a second dose stimulated an antibody rise but did so less effectively than H influenzae b oligosaccharide-CRM197 conjugate vaccine. Two doses of H influenzae b oligosaccharide-CRM197 conjugate vaccine were highly immunogenic; geometric means were 31 and 35 micrograms/mL in the 7- to 11-month and 12- to 15-month age groups, respectively. Following two doses of H influenzae b oligosaccharide-CRM197 conjugate vaccine, both immunization protocols resulted in (1) equally high geometric mean antibody levels 1 month after immunization and (2) similar geometric mean antibody levels 6 months after immunization. CONCLUSIONS. Haemophilus influenzae b oligosaccharide-CRM197 conjugate vaccine induces antibody levels that would be expected to protect infants from initial invasion and primes the immune system for an anamnestic response. Our data indicate that if a booster immunization is needed, H influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine could be an alternative to H influenzae b oligosaccharide-CRM197 conjugate vaccine.\r"

This led to a reexamination of the organic evaluation and the discovery of an undiagnosed organic contribution to the vomiting. In the fourth patient, gastric emptying studies confirmed that there was a strong psychological contribution to the vomiting, and helped to more carefully define this contribution.

While adults with CD4 counts less than 0.2 x 10(9)/L are at highest risk for Pneumocystis carinii, clinical or laboratory markers of high risk in children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus have not yet been established. A chart review of 13 infants with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection and children with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia revealed that infants younger than 12 months developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia despite CD4 counts that were normal by adult standards. In contrast to the markedly increased serum IgG levels seen in most children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, five children with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia had IgG levels less than 3.0 g/L. Twelve patients had pre-existing symptoms consistent with human immunodeficiency virus infection before the episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. In addition to clinical symptoms, low IgG levels and CD4 counts adjusted for age may serve to identify those children who are most at risk for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and therefore candidates for prophylaxis. Prophylaxis should be offered to all infants under age 12 months with proven, or clinical symptoms compatible with, human immunodeficiency virus infection. For children older than 12 months, CD4 counts less than 0.3 x 10(9)/L appear to be predictive of risk for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and these children should also receive prophylaxis.\r"

Neutropenia was diagnosed at 4 weeks of age. Antineutrophil antibody studies were negative. A bone marrow aspirate showed granulocytic hypoplasia and a maturation arrest at the promyelocyte stage. Hematopoietic cell culture showed normal numbers of colony-forming units-granulocyte macrophage. Serum granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor level, was 0.24 ng/mL (normal, greater than 0.05 ng/mL). Serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor levels, measured by enzyme immunoassay, were undetectable. The patient was successfully treated with filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), with an increase in the absolute neutrophil count to 10.0 x 10(9)/L. Thus, our case of Kostmann's syndrome appears to represent a defect in regulation or production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.\r"

Sixty-nine term neonates were studied through 2 weeks of age, and formula-fed neonates were randomized at birth to receive formula with molar ratios of 0.9, 1.2, or 1.4. Serum phosphate concentrations on days 2 and 6 of age were higher, and ionized calcium levels lower on days 6 and 14, in formula-fed vs human milk-fed neonates. Serum intact parathyroid hormone level increased between days 2 and 6 in formula-fed neonates compared with a decrease in human milk-fed neonates. Serum parathyroid hormone level on day 6 correlated with phosphorus intake among formula-fed neonates. No differences were noted in serum mineral or hormone levels among formula-fed groups. We speculate that the lowering of serum ionized calcium concentrations in neonates fed a modern \"humanized\" cow's milk formula may be a factor in late neonatal hypocalcemia.\r"

Prospective controlled study comparing two routes of drug administration. SETTING. Research laboratories of a large pharmaceutical company. PARTICIPANTS. Twenty male and female domestic swine weighing 10 to 20 kg. INTERVENTIONS. The animals were anesthetized and treated with controlled ventilation. The animals were divided into one of four groups: (1) intravenous and intraosseous cefotaxime sodium (50 mg/kg), (2) intravenous and intraosseous chloramphenicol sodium succinate (25 mg/kg), (3) intravenous and intraosseous vancomycin hydrochloride (15 mg/kg), or (4) intravenous and intraosseous tobramycin sulfate (2.5 mg/kg). There was a 24-hour clearance period for groups 1 and 2 and a 48-hour clearance period for groups 3 and 4. Serum drug levels were measured at 1, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after intravenous and intraosseous administration of the respective antibiotics. Control and treated tibias were sampled for drug levels at the end of the experiment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS. - Peak serum concentrations for intravenously administered antibiotics were within the therapeutic range. Peak serum levels after intravenous and intraosseous administration were 102 and 82 mg/L, respectively for cefotaxime; 13.9 and 6.3 mg/L, respectively, for chloramphenicol; 24.5 and 3.8 mg/L, respectively, for vancomycin; and 7.1 and 1.3 mg/L, respectively, for tobramycin. CONCLUSIONS. Cefotaxime may be administered intraosseously when intravenous access is not possible. We cannot recommend chloramphenicol or vancomycin for intraosseous administration, because serum levels were not comparable with those following intravenous administration. Findings with tobramycin suggested a lack of achievement of serum levels comparable with those following intravenous administration.\r"

Intraoperative ultrasonography demonstrated gallstones in 20 (19%) and gallbladder sludge in four (4%) patients. Eighty-one patients had a normal gallbladder ultrasound. After bariatric surgery, these patients were followed prospectively with periodic gallbladder ultrasound examinations. At 6 months, gallstones had developed in 36% and gallbladder sludge in 13% of patients. These percentages remained relatively constant at 12 and 18 months. Body weight declined rapidly after surgery from a mean of 132.3 kg to 95.5, 87.0, and 84.0 kg at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. Gallstones developed significantly more often in the white race, and in women. No significant differences in age, body weight, percent ideal body weight, percent weight loss, or percent of excess body weight lost existed between patients who developed gallstones or sludge and those who did not. Patients who developed gallbladder sludge had less cholesterol and lower cholesterol saturation (1.25 +/- 0.42) in their gallbladder bile than persons who developed gallstones (2.00 +/- 0.79). Forty percent (13/32) of patients who developed gallstones became symptomatic; nine (28%) underwent elective cholecystectomy. An attempt to prevent gallstone formation during rapid weight loss appears warranted.\r"

After closely reviewing relevant literature, it would appear that operative mortality in comparable cases is much higher.

To elucidate a role for pancreatic enzymes in ERCP-induced pancreatitis, we measured serum amylase, lipase, trypsin, and elastase in 25 patients undergoing ERCP. Serum alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin, two major pancreatic protease inhibitors, also were measured. All pancreatic enzymes measured rose significantly after ERCP. Pancreatic duct cannulation was associated with a greater elevation in serum amylase and lipase. Circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin was reduced by 7% (p = 0.04) 6 h after ERCP, whereas circulating alpha 1-antitrypsin increased over the same time period. Papillotomy, stent placement, or underlying disease did not influence changes any further. Three patients developed ERCP-induced pancreatitis. All three patients had circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin levels below 243 mg/dl (p = 0.03). The ERCP-induced alterations in circulating pancreatic enzymes and their inhibitors are similar to changes seen in clinical pancreatitis. Low circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin levels may predispose to ERCP-induced pancreatitis.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to describe our experience from 1976 through 1988 with fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of pancreatic lesions in 90 patients. Fine needle aspirations were performed preoperatively under ultrasound guidance (USG) in 46 patients, under computed tomographic guidance (CTG) in seven patients, and intraoperatively in 37 patients. Based on histologic, cytologic, and clinical findings, final diagnoses were reached in 80 patients, of whom 62 had malignant pancreatic disease (MPD) and 18 had benign pancreatic disease (BPD). The accuracy of cytologic diagnoses was verified by histologic, cytologic, and clinical findings. In 62 patients with MPD, the cytologic findings suggested malignancy in 54 patients, suspected malignancy in five, and did not reveal malignancy in three patients. Among 18 patients with BPD, all of the cytologic findings were reported as benign. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy for intraoperative FNA cytologic results were 96%, 100%, 100%, 91%, and 97%, respectively, and for USG FNA cytologic results were 94%, 100%, 100%, 78%, and 95%, respectively. No complications followed the procedure. Conclusions: Both transabdominal percutaneous imaging-guided and intraoperative FNA cytology of pancreatic lesions are simple, safe, and highly accurate methods in differentiation of benign from malignant pancreatic lesions.\r"

  ".W": "This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between indicators of preoperative glucose tolerance and quantitative changes of endocrine cells in the islet of Langerhans in patients with chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer. Twenty-one specimens of pancreatic tissue obtained from patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy for pancreatoduodenal cancer were divided into four groups according to the degree of fibrosis (Grades 0-III). Islet cells in serial sections were stained immunohistochemically to determine the proportions of B-, A-, D-, and PP-cells in the islets of Langerhans. In patients with pancreatic tissue with the most severe fibrosis, of several preoperative glucose metabolism indices measured, it was found that the ratio of integrated value of change in serum insulin to that of serum glucose (sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS) was significantly decreased. There was a significant positive correlation between proportion of B-cells, and both the ratio of change in insulin to that of glucose (delta IRI:delta BS) and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between proportion of A-cells and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. The present data strongly suggest that it is possible to estimate the degree of fibrosis and to quantify changes of the islet cells prior to surgery in patients with obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer by calculating these glucose metabolism indices, and that sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS is a particularly useful index.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1974 and 1989, 411 patients with pathologically and anatomically proven carcinoma of the head of the pancreas underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). According to the localization of the tumor, these patients were divided into those with a cranially, centrally (periductally), caudally, or indeterminately localized tumor. In cranially localized tumors, extrahepatic metastases and vessel invasion were absent or resectable in 53% and 46%, respectively. The tumor was resectable in 41% of cases. If a patient with a cranially localized tumor could not be operated curatively for secondary reasons, the prognosis was better than for tumors with another localization. If there was unresectable vessel invasion and the tumor was not resectable, the 0% survival rate was reached at 33 months. Of the curatively operated patients, 26% were alive at 36 months after the start of complaints. Of the centrally or periductally localized tumors, there were no liver metastases in 73%. Extrahepatic metastases and vessel invasion were absent or resectable in 57% and 53%, respectively. The tumor was resectable in 48% of cases. If there was unresectable vessel invasion or the tumor was unresectable, the 0% survival rate was reached after 18 months. These tumors have maximal chances at curative resection. Of the curatively operated patients, 31% were alive at 36 months after the start of complaints. In caudally localized tumors, there were liver metastases in 59%, unresectable other abdominal metastases in 93%, unresectable vessel invasion in 91%, and the tumor was unresectable in 96%. In patients with an unresectable vessel invasion or an unresectable tumor, the 0% survival rate was reached after 33 months; 3% of these patients were operated curatively. Indeterminately localized tumors had liver metastases in 77%, unresectable extrahepatic metastases in 90%, unresectable vessel invasion in 95%, and the tumor was unresectable in 91%. Only one of the 44 patients (2%) could be operated curatively.\r"

We applied ESWL after endoscopic sphincterotomy of the pancreatic orifice in eight patients with impacted pancreatic duct stones. An electromagnetic lithotriptor (Siemens Lithostar, Erlangen, FRG) was used. Patients were treated in prone position under fluoroscopic control. A mean of 6,813 shock waves (range 1,500-10,000) was delivered in one or two sessions. Disintegration of stones was achieved in 6/8 patients, initial relief of pain in 7/8 patients, and total clearance of the pancreatic duct in 3/8 patients. One patient had an exacerbation of her pancreatitis one day after ESWL, which resolved rapidly with medical treatment. No other complications were observed. Four of five patients with fragmented stones had no abdominal complaints at follow-up (mean 17 months, range 3-27). Three patients in whom ESWL was not completely successful (two without and one with partial fragmentation) underwent an operation according to Puestow. Two of them still have abdominal complaints after surgery. From these data, we conclude that ESWL of pancreatic duct stones is a promising new alternative for surgery, when endoscopic stone extraction fails.\r"

In this report, 25 patients with Crohn's disease who were being operated on for the first time had their small intestine measured at the time of surgery. The mean length of small intestine in this group was 501 cm, which was not different from a group of patients without Crohn's disease who were being operated on for other problems. In the group of patients with Crohn's disease, as well as the entire group, there was a correlation between increasing height and longer small bowel length. No other parameters investigated, including weight, surface area, age, sex, and duration of disease, correlated with bowel length. The results of this study are somewhat encouraging to patients with Crohn's disease, since these patients do not start off with a shortened bowel prior to surgery.\r"

  ".U": "91314541\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to assess effects of heme administered intravenously, complexed to human serum albumin, on activities of the hepatic hemoproteins, cytochrome(s) P-450, and tryptophan pyrrolase, and on the size of the heme pool that regulates activity of 5-aminolevulinate synthase. Effects were compared in six normal women and four women with acute intermittent porphyria. All porphyric subjects over-excreted heme precursors and had histories of acute neurovisceral porphyric attacks. All subjects were placed on a constant daily diet that included at least 3 g carbohydrate/kg body weight and sufficient total intake to provide 1.4 times the estimated resting energy expenditure. Urinary excretions of 5-aminolevulinate, porphobilinogen, porphyrins, and metabolites of tryptophan were measured daily before, during, and after infusions of heme-albumin. In the porphyric subjects, intravenous heme [4 mg (6.1 mumol)/kg body weight (BWt) with equimolar albumin], given daily for 4 days, markedly reduced overexcretion of 5-aminolevulinate, porphobilinogen, and porphyrins, indicating repletion of the regulatory heme pool. The heme infusions also decreased mean urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid from 4.9 to 2.9 mg/g creatinine per day, suggesting increased activity of hepatic tryptophan pyrrolase, the rate-controlling enzyme for metabolism of tryptophan to products not in the serotonin-5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid pathway. Heme-albumin infusions were without detectable effects on excretions of heme precursors or tryptophan metabolites in normal subjects. In contrast, in both normals and porphyrics, heme-albumin infusions significantly increased rates of antipyrine metabolism (by 159% and 330%, respectively), suggesting increased activities of cytochrome(s) P-450 were produced by the infusions. The infusions were well tolerated; no subject developed thrombophlebitis or bleeding. We conclude that such infusions are safe and effective in repleting deficient heme pools and hemoproteins in patients with acute porphyria, and that activities of cytochrome(s) P-450 in normal subjects may also be increased by heme administration. The therapeutic effect of heme in acute porphyria probably relates to its ability to decrease overproduction of precursors of heme or serotonin, as the result of its increasing critical cellular heme pools.\r"

The patient presented with diarrhea, right lower quadrant pain, fever, and significant weight loss. At surgery, the terminal ileum was inflamed, indurated, thickened, and angulated. Ileal endometriosis may be expected to simulate Crohn's disease, because intestinal endometriosis frequently produces local bowel inflammation, adhesions, stricture, and angulation. Ileal endometriosis should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease in menstruating females who are nulliparous and have dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, menometrorrhagia, or other perimenstrual symptoms. It is important not to mistake endometriosis for Crohn's disease because endometriosis has a different therapy.\r"

Physicians, especially in areas in which amebiasis is endemic, are familiar with this difficulty. Moreover, in individual cases, it may even be impossible to distinguish between the two conditions, since stool specimens, bowel biopsies, and serological studies may be negative for Entamoeba histolytica, even in the presence of invasive amebic colitis. Invasive amebiasis may rarely be superimposed on IBD, which further complicates the issue. We report here a young patient with a 7-yr history of Crohn's colitis proven histologically who developed invasive amebic colitis during steroid and 6-mercaptopurine treatment for active disease. Stool specimens, mucosal biopsies, and serological studies were negative for E. histolytica, and the diagnosis was established on pathological examination of a surgically resected bowel. Anti-amebic therapy should be considered in endemic areas in cases of persistent IBD.\r"

A pancreatic tumor was detected by ultrasonography and computed tomography, along with an elevation of serum vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). The secretory diarrhea diminished dramatically, and the serum VIP level decreased into the normal range immediately after resection of the pancreatic tumor. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a pancreatic vipoma. Despite removal of the vipoma, she underwent restorative proctocolectomy and ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis 2 yr later due to progression of the ulcerative colitis. Postoperative course was uneventful, with excellent functional results. Knowledge of this rare condition accompanying ulcerative colitis may help in the management of the patient with an atypical clinical course.\r"

A small intestinal neoplasm was diagnosed, and a partial resection of the jejunum was performed. Endoscopy on the operating table showed a large, irregularly shaped sessile ulcer. Histologically the tumor was diagnosed as choriocarcinoma, composed of syncytiotrophoblastic cells and cytotrophoblastic cells. Immunohistochemical staining for HCG was positive.

  ".W": "Screening colonoscopy was performed on 119 asymptomatic elderly men with no other risk factors for colonic neoplasms. Ninety adenomas were detected in 49 (41%) subjects. Mean adenoma size was 6.5 mm, with 83 (92%) less than or equal to 10 mm. Forty-nine (54%) adenomas were located proximal to the splenic flexure, and 17 (19%) were classified as tubulovillous or villous. Moderate- to high-grade dysplasia was found in 29 (32%) adenomas and was associated with larger size (p less than 0.0001) and villous architecture (p = 0.0038). Two subjects harbored adenomas with invasive cancer. Seventy-one hyperplastic polyps were found in 40 (34%) subjects. The mean size of hyperplastic polyps was 3.4 mm, and 64 (90%) were located in the left colon. We conclude that, in this population, adenomas are common lesions that are frequently small. However, substantial proportions of these adenomas may be at risk for malignant degeneration due to the presence of villous architecture and higher grades of dysplasia. Because adenomas and hyperplastic polyps are endoscopically indistinguishable, all polyps found at endoscopy should be removed or ablated.\r"

  ".W": "Screening of asymptomatic individuals for colon malignancy has been advocated for the past 20 yr in the hopes of reducing colon cancer mortality. Although sigmoidoscopy is an important element of current screening recommendations, the sensitivity of this test in asymptomatic subjects has never been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and location of polyps and cancers in an asymptomatic population by performing full colonoscopy. We wished to assess the sensitivity of screening flexible sigmoidoscopy to 60 cm by determining how many patients with adenomas or cancer had \"index\" adenomatous polyps in the distal 60 cm. One hundred five healthy male outpatients, over 50 yr old, with negative examinations for occult blood in stools and no prior history of colon pathology, had full colonoscopy. Careful examination of the distal 60 cm was performed, followed by a full colon examination to the cecum. Forty-three patients (41%) had adenomatous polyps, and only 19 of these patients had an index adenomatous polyp in the distal 60 cm. Therefore, the sensitivity of sigmoidoscopy was 44%. The prevalence of adenomas increased with age. Patients were assigned to one of three groups based on the findings in the distal 60 cm. Group 1 (n = 65) had no polyps in the distal 60 cm, but 18 of these patients (28%) had adenomatous polyps in the proximal colon. Among 21 patients with only hyperplastic polyps in the distal 60 cm (group 2), six patients (29%) had proximal adenomas. In group 3, eight of 19 patients (42%) with adenomas in the distal 60 cm also had proximal adenomatous polyps. We conclude that adenomatous polyps are common in asymptomatic men who have negative tests for fecal occult blood. Sigmoidoscopy to 60 cm had a sensitivity of only 44% in this patient population, suggesting that this is an insensitive test for the detection of patients with adenomatous polyps.\r"

  ".W": "Performance of same-day upper and lower endoscopy has many potential advantages, as it may reduce costs, shorten hospital stay, and expedite patient care, but its feasibility, efficacy, and potential have not been carefully defined. We report here our experience with a group of 87 patients who underwent same-day upper and lower endoscopy (174 procedures) over a 2-yr period at a tertiary care VA Hospital, compared with an alternate-day upper and lower endoscopy group of 50 patients (100 procedures) over the same time period. Most patients were elderly males. Common indications for endoscopy were occult or overt gastrointestinal bleeding, previous or concomitant history of pertinent pathology (i.e., polyps, ulcers), abdominal pain, diarrhea, or other symptoms, abnormal radiological studies, and iron deficiency anemia. Both groups required similar amounts of intravenous sedation. There were no complications in either group. In both groups, common positive findings were inflammation (i.e., colitis, esophagitis), benign neoplasms, diverticulae, peptic ulcer, and cancer. In both groups, only 2-6% had negative upper and lower endoscopy, whereas either one procedure was negative in 25% and 18% of cases, respectively. We conclude that the practice of same-day inpatient upper and lower endoscopy is feasible, has excellent diagnostic yield, even in the elderly, and carries no increased risks. When indicated, the practice of same-day upper and lower endoscopy should be encouraged.\r"

Hemodynamic parameters were recorded at 3-min intervals before, during, and after the procedure. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy resulted in an increased heart rate (HR), while colonoscopy caused a decreased blood pressure (BP) and HR. Hemodynamic aberrations occurred in 71% of monitored patients, including hypotension 6%, hypertension 30%, bradycardia 26%, and tachycardia 32%. Only one-third of the hypotensive episodes were recognized as aberrations, and therapeutic intervention did not improve outcome. No monitored or control patient had an adverse result. Certain hemodynamic changes were directly correlated with the baseline BP or HR and associated with the presence of coronary artery disease, particular medicines with cardiovascular effects and longer procedure duration. We conclude that automated monitoring during routine endoscopy unmasks frequent hemodynamic aberrations that are clinically insignificant. Routine monitoring during endoscopy does not improve outcome.\r"

The findings were benign esophageal disease (43%), normal (15%), gastric ulcer (11.5%), and duodenal ulcer (11%). Gastric ulcers were more common in women taking NSAIDs (25%) than in NSAID abstainers (7%) p less than 0.001 and male NSAID users (8%) p less than 0.001. Esophagitis and esophageal stricture were not influenced by NSAID usage, but gastric erosions were more common (10% vs. 3%) p less than 0.01. Of 142 patients receiving NSAIDs, 41% presented with hemorrhage, compared with 20.5% of NSAID abstainers (p less than 0.001). Hemorrhage was as common in aspirin takers (15 of 33, 45%) as in standard-dose NANSAID takers (43 of 109, 39%), even though 86% were taking 300 mg of aspirin per day or less. In elderly patients, esophageal disease is common. NSAID use, even low-dose aspirin, is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage. In females, NSAID usage is associated with gastric ulcer.\r"

To assess the prevalence and characteristics of GER within this patient population, questionnaires evaluating symptoms associated with GER were administered to 313 consecutive patients 62 yr old or older from a primary care setting. Fourteen percent of these patients reported having at least weekly heartburn. Ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring was accomplished in 54 of the 313 patients surveyed. Twenty percent (11/54) of this subgroup exhibited increased acid contact time (pH less than 4 for more than 6% of the monitoring period). Twenty-two percent (12/54) complained of heartburn, yet only six individuals (11%) exhibited both symptomatic and objective indications of acid reflux. Surprisingly, 31% (17/54) of the patients studied exhibited significant alkalinity within the distal esophagus (pH greater than 8 for greater than 1.5% of the monitoring period). Whereas 29% of these patients (5/17) reported heartburn, 40% of those reporting heartburn (2/5) had acid GER as well as excessive alkalinity. In contrast to patients with acid GER--none of whom reported pulmonary symptoms--24% (4/17) of these patients with esophageal alkalinity reported wheezing, nocturnal cough, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Of the four patients with significant distal esophageal exposure to both acid and alkali, two reported heartburn and a third reported dysphagia. In addition to the somewhat higher prevalence of acid reflux than anticipated, a surprisingly high prevalence of esophageal alkalinity was observed.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is associated with a significant reduction of the rate of duodenal ulcer (DU) relapse. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term effect of a bismuth-free triple therapy on the eradication of H. pylori and reduction of DU relapse. After informed consent, 61 patients with endoscopically proven DU and H. pylori infection detected on 14C-urea breath test (BT) were included in the study. All patients received a combination of furazolidone, amoxicillin, and metronidazole, three times a day, for 5 days, in addition to eventual classical antiulcer agents prescribed by their attending physicians. BT was repeated after an interval of at least 60 days to evaluate H. pylori eradication. Endoscopy and another BT were performed again at 6.5 months after therapy to detect possible recurrences. Forty-eight patients completed the trial: 26 (54%) patients were negative for H. pylori at 6.5 months after the end of treatment, and 22 (46%) persisted H. pylori positive. Ninety-two percent of the patients in whom the bacteria were eradicated showed endoscopically healed ulcers and were asymptomatic, and two that were symptomatic presented only occasional pain not requiring therapy. Among the 22 patients who persisted H. pylori positive, six (27%) showed endoscopically active ulcers (p = 0.012) and eight (36%) patients continued to be symptomatic (p less than 0.01), and were still using antiulcer drugs (p = 0.002) 6.5 months after treatment. It is concluded that combined treatment with furazolidone, amoxicillin, and metronidazole for 5 days represents a well-tolerated, inexpensive, and effective therapeutic regime for the eradication of H. pylori and abolition of DU relapse in more than 50% of the patients during a follow-up period of 6.5 months.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous studies have shown that the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the stomach is linked to the development of chronic gastritis most commonly seen in the antrum. However, the pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. In 23 of 31 patients, examined due to symptoms from the upper gastrointestinal tract, H. pylori-associated chronic gastritis of the antrum was diagnosed histologically and by growth of H. pylori. Immunoperoxidase staining on gastric biopsy specimens from these patients showed an increased number of gamma/delta T-cells within the epithelium. Furthermore, the Mab ML30 (raised against the 65 kDa heat shock protein of mycobacteria) demonstrated positive staining in the gastric epithelial cells in all H. pylori-positive but not in H. pylori-negative biopsy specimens. H. pylori also reacted with ML30, as detected by immunoperoxidase staining as well as by immunoblotting. Intraepithelial gamma/delta T cells may play a role in host defense against invading H. pylori, and the bacteria may trigger an autoimmune response to stress proteins expressed by the gastric epithelial cells.\r"

In each instance, the abdominal CT examination proved crucial in the diagnosis of duodenal diverticulitis, with contained perforation or inflammatory changes involving the adjacent structures. Five patients underwent laparotomy while two others were treated conservatively with antibiotics and/or percutaneous drainage of peridiverticular abscess. The clinical and radiological features of this uncommon entity are herein described, along with a brief review of the medical literature regarding the current approach to its diagnosis and management.\r"

In the untreated group, 95% of patients had enteric protein loss with values higher than the upper limit of normality (mean +/- 2 SD). In the treated group of patients, only 22% had abnormal levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance. Sixteen patients who had elevated clearance before treatment had decreased clearance after an average of 7.4 months on a gluten-free diet. There was a significant relation (p less than 0.05) between the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and the degree of alteration of the jejunal histological structure. We conclude that enteric protein loss is a very frequent finding in celiac patients and the measurement of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance may be a reliable method to evaluate the activity of the disease and useful in following the efficacy of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Cholelithiasis is more prevalent in diabetics than in nondiabetics. Gallbladder dysmotility is supposed to be one of the causative factors. Reduced alpha-adrenergic tone has been demonstrated in the enterocytes of diabetic rats, and its correction by clonidine might explain the beneficial effect that the drug has on diabetic diarrhea. We therefore surmised that diabetic cholecystoparesis could also be due to alpha-adrenergic alterations. To test this hypothesis, we studied gallbladder contractions by real time ultrasonography, and small bowel transit time by lactulose hydrogen breath test, in 13 insulin-requiring diabetics before and after administration of the alpha-adrenergic stimulant clonidine (0.3 mg orally). That plasma levels were sufficient was evidenced indirectly by a fall in blood pressure. Clonidine significantly improved the rate of emptying (0.0193 +/- 0.00057/min vs. 0.0318 +/- 0.0027/min; p less than 0.005), but not the fasting and residual gallbladder volumes. Small bowel transit time was significantly prolonged after clonidine (169 +/- 17 min vs. 208 +/- 17; p less than 0.05). These results suggest that 1) reduced alpha-adrenergic tone corrected by clonidine may be present in the diabetic gallbladder, and 2) clonidine's antidiarrheal effect might be explained, at least in part, by a prolongation of the small bowel transit time.\r"

To investigate the pathophysiology in those patients with DU who are HP-negative compared with those who are HP-positive, we interviewed consecutive patients prior to endoscopy regarding factors often associated with ulcer disease. At esophagogastroduodenoscopy, antral biopsy specimens were obtained for urease test, culture, and Warthin Starry staining for HP in all patients with DU who did not have active bleeding. RESULTS: Compared with HP-positive patients who had DU, HP-negative patients with DU were more likely to be aspirin users and less likely to have had prior ulcers. HP-positive patients with DU had more severe antral inflammation than HP-negative patients. Whites were more likely to be HP-negative than blacks. HP-negative patients with DU most commonly presented with bleeding, whereas HP-positive patients with DU presented with pain. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a different mechanism for DUs in patients who are HP-positive versus those who are HP-negative, and this difference might have a bearing on treatment. The absence of HP should lead to a more thorough search for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug/aspirin use, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and other potential causes of DUs.\r"

This study prospectively examined the incidence of radiographically undetectable completely obstructing lesions encountered during routine diagnostic bronchoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred for bronchoscopy at the San Diego Veterans Administration Medical Center because of suspected bronchogenic carcinoma formed the population base. Chest radiographs were interpreted routinely 24 hours prior to bronchoscopy. Patients found to have complete endobronchial obstruction during bronchoscopy were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Eighty-one completely obstructing lesions were found in 77 patients. No radiographic signs of obstruction were found in 36 (44%) completely obstructing endobronchial lesions. There was no difference in the rate of radiographically occult tumors based on cell type. Obstruction of segmental bronchi was more likely to be undetectable than obstruction of more proximal airways. Chest radiographs were normal in 13 (16%). All 13 had risk factors for and symptoms suggestive of bronchogenic carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Complete endobronchial obstruction due to bronchogenic carcinoma can occur frequently in patients at risk for lung cancer. The significant incidence of radiographically undetectable complete obstruction has implications for the diagnosis, staging, and assessment of treatment of lung cancer.\r"

Fifteen patients were immigrants who had acquired malaria while visiting their country of origin, particularly West Africa. Fever was present in 67% of cases and gastrointestinal complaints were prominent in 26%. Individuals with a past history of malaria could accurately distinguish current malarial infections from other febrile illnesses. Two patients developed cerebral malaria. Plasmodium falciparum was identified in 77% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria is an important diagnosis that United States physicians must consider in the medical evaluation of returning travelers. A significant increase in the number of cases of P. falciparum acquired in East Africa has been reported in recent years. P. falciparum infection must be rapidly diagnosed and treated since delays may result in complications of malaria that may lead to death. Mefloquine is currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control for prevention of malaria in travelers visiting countries endemic for chloroquine-resistant malaria. This change may alter the epidemiology of malaria in the United States in the future.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Hemostatic alterations and elevated tumor necrosis factor/cachectin (TNF alpha) serum levels may contribute to the pathogenesis of organ complications in human Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Therefore, we examined whether altered protein C (PC) and thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) plasma levels correlated with TNF alpha serum concentrations, parasitemia, and the clinical course of human P. falciparum malaria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients with P. falciparum malaria were evaluated prospectively before and during antiparasitic therapy. TNF alpha serum levels were determined by immunoradiometric assay, PC and TAT plasma antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and PC and PC inhibitor-1 (PCI-1) activity levels by functional tests. Cultured endothelial cells were incubated with serum from four patients with malaria and from healthy control subjects and then assayed for procoagulant activity. Northern blot hybridization was used to detect tissue factor mRNA. RESULTS: In vivo, TNF alpha serum concentrations were elevated (median: 38.6 pg/mL; n = 47) while plasma levels of PC (antigen 55.4%; activity 39.0%; n = 47) and PCI-1 (0.56 U/L) were decreased in almost all patients before antiparasitic treatment. At the same time, TAT concentrations were high. These alterations correlated significantly (p less than 0.01) both with the severity of the disease (as defined by organ impairment) and with the number of circulating parasitized erythrocytes. Low PCI-1 activity correlated with low PC activity (p less than 0.001) and antigen (p less than 0.05) levels. The plasma level of coagulation factor IX, another vitamin K-dependent protein, was not significantly changed. In vitro, incubation of endothelial cells with patient serum (severe P. falciparum malaria) increased both endothelial cell procoagulant activity and cytoplasmic tissue factor mRNA levels. CONCLUSION: Elevated levels of TNF alpha and TAT, decreased plasma levels of anticoagulant PC, and the induction of procoagulant activity in endothelial cells by patient serum indicate a shift in the balance of hemostatic activity towards a procoagulant state in P. falciparum malaria. The alterations in TNF alpha, TAT, and PC levels may be a response to infection, since they correlate with parasitemia and are reversed during antiparasitic treatment.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report the incidence, the antecedents, and the clinical significance of clinically recognized cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks (CVA-TIA) complicating acute myocardial infarction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 1981 to 1983, a secondary prevention study with nifedipine (SPRINT) was conducted in 14 hospitals in Israel among 2,276 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the study, demographic, historical, and medical data were collected on special forms for all patients with diagnosed acute myocardial infarction in 13 of these 14 hospitals (the SPRINT registry, n = 5,839). Mortality follow-up was completed for 99% of hospital survivors for a mean follow-up of 5.5 years (range: 4.5 to 7 years). RESULTS: The incidence of CVA-TIA was 0.9% (54 of 5,839). The latter rate increased significantly only with age, from 0.4% among patients up to 59 years old to 1.6% among those aged greater than or equal to 70 years. Multivariate analysis identified age, congestive heart failure, and history of stroke as predictors of CVA-TIA during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. Patients with CVA-TIA exhibited a complicated hospital course, with a 15-day mortality rate of 41%. Subsequent mortality rates in survivors at 1 and 5 years were 34% and 59%, respectively. Rates at the same time points in patients without CVA-TIA were 16%, 11%, and 29% (p less than 0.01). In a multivariate analysis that included age, gender, congestive heart failure, history of previous myocardial infarction, and hypertension, CVA-TIA was independently associated with increased 15-day mortality (covariate-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.62; 90% confidence interval [CI], 1.59 to 4.32), as well as subsequent 1-year (OR = 3.29; 90% CI, 1.70 to 6.36) and long-term (mean follow-up = 5.5 years) mortality (OR = 2.46; 90% CI, 1.30 to 4.69). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of consecutive patients with myocardial infarction, CVA-TIA was a relatively infrequent complication of acute myocardial infarction. Factors independently favoring the occurrence of CVA-TIA were old age, previous CVA, and congestive heart failure. CVA-TIA occurring during acute myocardial infarction independently increased the risk of early death threefold as well as the risk of long-term mortality in early-phase survivors. (2.5-fold).\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The impact of long-term L-thyroxine replacement therapy on skeletal integrity is a growing concern because of the large number of women receiving thyroid hormone therapy. The purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that long-term L-thyroxine therapy in which the free thyroxine index (FT4I) is maintained within a physiologic range has minimal impact on vertebral or femoral bone mineral density in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured hip integral and spinal trabecular and integral bone densities in 28 premenopausal and 28 postmenopausal women who had been receiving L-thyroxine therapy for a median of 12 and 15 years, respectively, and in whom therapy was titrated to keep the FT4I within the normal range. The relationship between bone density parameters and thyroid hormone status was examined using univariate and multivariate statistical methods. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of the premenopausal women and 86% of the postmenopausal women had FT4I values in the normal range at the time of bone density determination. Moreover, throughout the study's duration, the majority of annually measured values were in the normal range for more than 80% of subjects. Premenopausal women had slightly lower bone density than would be expected for age: -6.7% (z = -0.39 +/- 0.74 [mean +/- SD], p less than 0.01), -3.1% (z = -0.22 +/- 0.78, p = 0.15), and -5.1% (z = -0.36 +/- 0.74, p less than 0.02) for spinal trabecular, spinal integral, and hip integral bone density, respectively. Postmenopausal women likewise had slightly lower bone density values that were significant only at the hip: -0.2% (z = -0.01 +/- 1.01, p = 0.95), -1.0% (z = -0.05 +/- 1.11, p = 0.80), and -6.2% (z = -0.39 +/- 0.80, p less than 0.02) for spinal trabecular, spinal integral, and hip integral bone density, respectively. When patients with previously treated Graves' disease (n = 4 in each group) were eliminated, the differences in bone density at the hip were no longer seen. Correlation analysis revealed only weak and generally nonsignificant relationships between parameters of thyroid hormone status and bone density at any site in either subgroup. Results of multiple regression analysis among the pooled data of all subjects showed that age provided a consistently significant contribution (R2 = 0.18 to 0.66) to the variability in bone density at the spine and the hip, but parameters of thyroid hormone status did not. CONCLUSION: These data provide the first supportive evidence that long-term L-thyroxine therapy that maintains the FT4I in the physiologic range is associated with a statistically significant, but clinically minimal, decrement in spinal and hip bone density in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The decrement at the hip was entirely due to the inclusion of patients with treated Graves' diseases. Thus, the changes in bone density in women receiving long-term L-thyroxine therapy are minimal at most and should not be a contraindication to therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in black Americans consists of two variants: one with insulin resistance and one with normal insulin sensitivity. This study examined whether cardiovascular disease risk factors are significantly different between the two variants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two black patients with NIDDM in near-normoglycemic remission who were receiving no pharmacologic therapy for NIDDM were evaluated for insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic insulin clamp, plasma insulin levels, degree of obesity, glucose metabolism, serum total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and fasting plasma triglyceride levels. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of these patients had normal insulin sensitivity (glucose disposal rate in response to a 1 mU.kg-1.minute-1 insulin infusion greater than 6.0 mg.kg-1.minute-1). The insulin-sensitive patients were less obese (body mass index [BMI] 26.5 +/- 0.6 versus 30.8 +/- 0.9 kg/m2) and had lower fasting plasma insulin levels (56.9 +/- 7.8 versus 88.0 +/- 6.0 pmol/L), lower serum cholesterol (4.47 +/- 0.30 versus 6.39 +/- 0.26 mmol/L), lower serum LDL cholesterol (2.77 +/- 0.31 versus 4.51 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and lower fasting plasma triglyceride levels (0.83 +/- 0.08 versus 1.45 +/- 0.16 mmol/L) than the insulin-resistant patients. Serum HDL cholesterol was not different between the two groups and was in the high-normal range (1.31 +/- 0.08 and 1.19 +/- 0.07 mmol/L). Univariate analysis demonstrated that serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and fasting plasma triglycerides were highly correlated with insulin-mediated glucose disposal and fasting plasma insulin. The differences in insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles were independent of obesity, as they were present in six insulin-resistant and six insulin-sensitive patients matched for BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Black patients with the insulin-sensitive variant of NIDDM have a low risk factor profile for cardiovascular disease as compared with those with the insulin-resistant variant, who have a high risk factor profile. A high prevalence of the insulin-sensitive variant of NIDDM in the black population might explain the lower prevalence of angina and myocardial infarction in black patients with NIDDM as compared with white patients with NIDDM.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The serum samples of 28 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven vasculitis involving medium- and/or small-sized arteries were tested for ANCA by an indirect immunofluorescence technique, by neutrophil extract enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and by catching ELISA. RESULTS: Eight patients had Churg-Strauss syndrome; six had myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies, and in the other two patients, ANCA were not detected. Six patients had polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) limited to the skin and the musculoskeletal system; ANCA were not detected in these patients. Two patients had systemic PAN and both had MPO antibodies. The remaining 12 patients had overlapping clinical features of the different forms of vasculitis. Five patients had polyarteritis in combination with chronic nasal inflammation and glomerulonephritis compatible with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) but without granulomas in the respiratory tract. All five patients had 29-kd serine protease antibodies. Two patients had polyarteritis in combination with nasal polyposis and asthma compatible with Churg-Strauss syndrome, but eosinophilia was not detected. Both patients had MPO antibodies. Three patients with unclassified granulomatous arteritis had either elastase antibodies or ANCA of unknown specificity. One patient with unclassified systemic vasculitis had 29-kd serine protease antibodies, and one patient with necrotizing arteritis of the bowel in combination with Schonlein-Henoch purpura was negative for ANCA. CONCLUSION: Determination of ANCA and its specificities is a useful adjunct to the classification of patients with biopsy-proven necrotizing arteritis. Within the spectrum of idiopathic vasculitides, 29-kd serine protease antibodies are associated with WG, MPO antibodies are associated with Churg-Strauss syndrome and systemic PAN, and PAN limited to the skin and the musculoskeletal system is not associated with ANCA.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To evaluate prospectively whether serum theophylline concentrations of 25 mg/L and greater were predictable (and presumably preventable) by use of basic pharmacokinetic calculations. DESIGN: Prospective study. PATIENTS: Fifty-five patients with a serum theophylline concentration of at least 25.0 mg/L were evaluated initially and if subsequent elevated theophylline concentrations occurred. INTERVENTIONS: The predicted steady-state serum theophylline concentration was calculated from the dosage rate divided by the predicted clearance to determine how many elevated concentrations (greater than 20 mg/L) were predictable. Predicted clearances were 0.04 L/kg/hour for normal subjects less than 70 years of age and 0.02 L/kg/hour for patients with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or liver disease. Estimated clearances were determined and compared with predicted clearances. If patients did not have steady-state concentrations, additional calculations were made. MAIN RESULTS: From 6,368 consecutive theophylline determinations, 69 (1.08%) samples from 55 patients were 25 mg/L or higher. Predictably high concentrations occurred in 23 of 33 (69.7%) fully evaluable cases. These concentrations occurred because of a failure to consider decreased elimination clearance from congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or hepatic disease. Five fatalities occurred, and in two cases, theophylline appeared to contribute to the patient's death. Three other patients experienced syncope. The predicted elimination clearance of theophylline of 0.02 L/kg/hour was too high in eight patients over 70 years old with cardiac or pulmonary disease. Nursing and pharmacy oversights were identified as three patients were given two theophylline products simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Most elevated theophylline concentrations are predictable (and preventable) by basic pharmacokinetic calculations. Patients experiencing elevated theophylline concentrations often had comorbid conditions and were greater than 60 years of age. The dosage rate of theophylline (mg/hour) can be estimated from predicted clearance (L/kg/hour) times desired steady-state serum concentration (mg/L).\r"
