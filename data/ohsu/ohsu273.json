  ".W": "The available data on potential alterations in serum melatonin (MLT) levels during a human lifetime are fragmentary and inconsistent. We, therefore, measured day- and nighttime serum MLT concentrations in 367 subjects (210 males and 157 females), aged 3 days to 90 yr. Blood samples were collected between 0730 and 1000 h and between 2300 and 0100 h. Serum MLT levels were measured by RIA. The mean nighttime serum MLT concentration was low during the first 6 months of life, i.e. 27.3 +/- 5.4 (+/- SE) pg/mL (0.12 +/- 0.02 nmol/L). It then increased to a peak value at 1-3 yr of age [329.5 +/- 42.0 pg/mL; (1.43 +/- 0.18 nmol/L)], and it was considerably lower [62.5 +/- 9.0 pg/mL; (0.27 +/- 0.04 nmol/L)] in individuals aged 15-20 yr. During the following decades serum MLT declined moderately until old age (70-90 yr of age), i.e. 29.2 +/- 6.1 pg/mL (0.13 +/- 0.03 nmol/L). This biphasic MLT decline follows 2 exponential functions with different slopes (from age 1-20 yr: r = -0.56; P less than 0.001; y = 278.7 X e -0.09x; from age 20-90 yr: r = -0.44; P less than 0.001; y = 84.8 X e -0.017x). The decrease in nocturnal serum MLT in children and adolescents (1-20 yr) correlated with the increase in body weight (r = -0.54; P less than 0.001) and body surface area (r = -0.71; P less than 0.001). At a later age (20-90 yr) there was no correlation among these variables. Daytime serum MLT levels were low and no age-related alterations were found. This study revealed major age-related alterations in nocturnal serum MLT levels. The negative correlation between serum MLT and body weight in childhood and adolescence is evidence that expansion of body size is responsible for the huge MLT decrease during that period. The moderate decline at older ages must derive from other factors.\r"

S2 segments of the proximal straight tubule were perfused in vitro and changes in intracellular pH (pHi) and chloride activity (aCli) were monitored by double-barreled microelectrodes. Total peritubular chloride replacement with gluconate increased pHi by 0.8, and this change was inhibited by a pretreatment with an anion transport inhibitor, SITS. Peritubular bicarbonate reduction increased aCli, and most of this increase was lost when ambient sodium was totally removed. The reduction rates of pHi induced by a peritubular bicarbonate reduction or sodium removal were attenuated by 20% by withdrawal of ambient chloride. SITS application to the bath in the control condition quickly increased pHi, but did not change aCli. However, the aCli slightly decreased in response to SITS when the basolateral bicarbonate efflux was increased by reducing peritubular bicarbonate concentration. It is concluded that sodium coupled chloride/bicarbonate exchange is present in parallel with sodium-bicarbonate cotransport in the basolateral membrane of the rabbit proximal tubule, and it contributes to the basolateral bicarbonate and chloride transport.\r"

However, there are patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea who have low-normal pharyngeal collapsibility. The factors leading to nocturnal upper airway obstruction in such patients have not been ascertained. We studied 10 overweight male patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea and low-normal pharyngeal collapsibility to determine the site of upper airway pathology in these patients. We found that all 10 patients exhibited paradoxical inspiratory narrowing of the glottis during quiet tidal breathing. This phenomenon was not observed in a matched group of 10 snoring, nonapneic male controls. We conclude that paradoxical glottic narrowing may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of upper airway obstruction in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea who have low-normal pharyngeal collapsibility.\r"

  ".W": "To define the primary effects of aluminum on bone in the mammalian species, we examined the dose/time-dependent actions of aluminum in normal beagles. Administration of low dose aluminum (0.75 mg/kg) significantly elevated the serum aluminum (151.7 +/- 19.9 micrograms/liter) compared with that in controls (4.2 +/- 1.35 micrograms/liter) but did not alter the calcium, creatinine, or parathyroid hormone. After 8 wk of therapy, bone biopsies displayed reduced bone resorption (2.6 +/- 0.63 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.39%) and osteoblast covered bone surfaces (2.02 +/- 0.51 vs. 7.64 +/- 1.86%), which was indicative of low turnover. In contrast, prolonged treatment resulted in increased bone volume and trabecular number (38.9 +/- 1.35 vs. 25.2 +/- 2.56% and 3.56 +/- 0.23 vs. 2.88 +/- 0.11/mm) which was consistent with uncoupled bone formation. Administration of higher doses of aluminum (1.20 mg/kg) increased the serum aluminum further (1242.3 +/- 259.8 micrograms/liter) but did not affect calcium, creatinine, or parathyroid hormone. However, after 8 wk of treatment, bone biopsies displayed changes similar to those after long-term, low-dose therapy. In this regard, an increased trabecular number (3.41 +/- 0.18/mm) and bone volume (36.5 +/- 2.38%) again provided evidence of uncoupled bone formation. In contrast, in this instance poorly mineralized woven bone contributed to the enhanced bone volume. High-dose treatment for 16 wk further enhanced bone volume (50.4 +/- 4.61%) and trabecular number (3.90 +/- 0.5/mm). These observations illustrate that aluminum may stimulate uncoupled bone formation and induce a positive bone balance. This enhancement of bone histogenesis contrasts with the effects of pharmacologic agents that alter the function of existing bone remodeling units.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of bone marrow transplant patients have suggested that the stromal cells of the in vitro hematopoietic microenvironment are transplantable into conditioned recipients. Moreover, in patients with myeloproliferative disorders, all of the stromal cells, which include presumptive endothelial cells, appear to be derived from hematopoietic precursors. To confirm these findings, we have constructed two chimeric mouse models: (a) traditional radiation chimeras, and (b) fetal chimeras, produced by placental injection of bone marrow into genetically anemic Wx/Wv fetuses, a technique that essentially precludes engraftment of nonhematopoietic cells. Using two-color indirect immunofluorescence, the stromal cells in long-term bone marrow culture derived from these chimeras were analyzed for donor or host origin by strain-specific H-2 antigens, and for cell lineage by a variety of other specific markers. 75-95% of the stromal cells were shown to be hematopoietic cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage, based upon donor origin, phagocytosis, and expression of specific hematopoietic surface antigens. The remaining 5-25% of the stromal cells were exclusively host in origin. Apart from occasional fat cells, these cells uniformly expressed collagen type IV, laminin, and a surface antigen associated with endothelial cells. Since these endothelial-like cells are not transplantable into radiation or fetal chimeras, they are not derived from hematopoietic stem cells. The contrast between our findings and human studies suggests either unexpected species differences in the origin of stromal lineages or limitations in the previous methodology used to detect nonhematopoietic stromal cells.\r"

We assessed the viability of gland cells with fast green exclusion, release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the medium, and ultrastructural damage by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Both indomethacin and ethanol significantly reduced the viability of placebo-pretreated glands, increased LDH release into the medium, and produced prominent ultrastructural damage. DmPGE2 significantly reduced both indomethacin and ethanol-induced injury, increased the number of viable cells, reduced LDH release, and diminished the extent of ultrastructural damage. These studies indicate that PG protection of gastric mucosal cells has a direct cellular action that is not limited to replacement of depleted endogenous PGs. PG protection in our experiments did not depend on PG's previously described systemic actions, such as protection of the microvessels, preservation of the mucosal blood flow, or stimulation of bicarbonate and mucus secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Two intestinal brush border membrane carboxypeptidases were found to participate in the sequential digestion of proline-containing peptides representing a novel mechanism of hydrolysis from the COOH terminus. NH2-blocked prolyl tripeptides were rapidly hydrolyzed by either brush border membrane angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, E.C. 3.4.15.1) or carboxypeptidase P (E.C.3.4.12-) depending on the position of the proline residue. Furthermore, these two enzymes were found to participate in a concerted manner to sequentially degrade larger proline-containing pentapeptides from the COOH terminus. A brush border membrane associated neutral endopeptidase also participated in the hydrolysis of the prolyl pentapeptides. During in vivo intestinal perfusion, the NH2-blocked prolyl peptides were degraded and their constituent amino acids efficiently absorbed by the intestine. Furthermore, hydrolysis and absorption of these peptides could be dramatically suppressed by low concentrations of captopril, a specific inhibitor of ACE. These studies show that prolyl peptides are efficiently and sequentially hydrolyzed from the COOH terminus by the combined action of ACE and carboxypeptidase P, and that these enzymes may play an important role in the digestion and assimilation of proline-containing peptides.\r"

  ".W": "We infused dobutamine into the left main coronary artery of 24 patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and 8 normal subjects without hemodynamic dysfunction. The maximal +dP/dt response to intracoronary (IC) dobutamine in CHF patients was only 37% of that in normals. This decrease in maximal response was not associated with a rightshift in the EC50 for dobutamine's effect on +dP/dt, or a decrease in the affinity of myocardial beta adrenergic receptors for dobutamine determined in vitro. In nine of the CHF patients, IC dobutamine infusion was followed by IC infusion of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone, and subsequently, by a second IC infusion of dobutamine. After IC milrinone, the increase in +dP/dt caused by IC dobutamine (74 +/- 10%) was significantly greater than that caused by the first infusion of dobutamine (52 +/- 11%; P less than 0.003) or milrinone (42 +/- 6%; P less than 0.001). Resting plasma norepinephrine was markedly elevated in CHF patients (837 +/- 208 ng/liter), but not in normal subjects (142 +/- 32 ng/liter); and the increase in +dP/dt caused by IC dobutamine was inversely related to resting plasma norepinephrine levels (r = -0.653; P less than 0.001). IC dobutamine caused a dose-related decrease in plasma norepinephrine (maximal effect, -160 +/- 31 ng/liter; P less than 0.001). Thus, (a) the maximal inotropic response to dobutamine is markedly depressed in patients with severe CHF, and is significantly greater after pretreatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone; (b) the impairment in inotropic response to dobutamine is inversely related to circulating norepinephrine levels; and (c) myocardial stimulation by dobutamine results in withdrawal of sympathetic tone.\r"

  ".W": "Alterations in cation homeostasis during and after recovery from myocardial ischemia may account for some of the reversible and irreversible components of myocardial cell injury. To investigate possible mechanisms involved, we exposed cultured layers of spontaneously contracting chick embryo ventricular cells to media containing 1 mM cyanide (CN) and 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), and zero glucose for up to 6 h, and then allowed cultured cells to recover in serum-free culture medium for 24 h. Changes in Na, K, and Ca contents, 42K uptake and efflux, ATP content, cell water content, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were measured, and compared with changes produced by exposure to 10(-3) M ouabain and severe hypoxia. Exposure to CN and 2-DG caused marked increase in cell Na (sevenfold) and Ca (fivefold) contents, and a decrease in K content (one-fifth normal), coincident with ATP depletion to one-tenth normal levels. This produced only slight cell injury, evidenced by increased LDH release. Recovery for 24 h resulted in return to near normal values (expressed in nanomoles per milligram of protein) of Na, Ca, and ATP contents. However, there was failure of cell K content to return to normal, associated with a persistent reduced net uptake of 42K, and an increase in the rate of 42K efflux. These abnormalities in K homeostasis were associated with a decrease in cell volume and water content per milligram of protein. More marked ATP depletion (to 1/100 normal values) was produced by hypoxia plus 2-DG and zero glucose, and was associated with much more severe cell injury manifested by LDH loss. Ouabain exposure resulted in a much greater Ca gain (20-30-fold), relative to increase in Na content, than did either CN and 2-DG or hypoxia; and ouabain effects were not reversible (after a 15-fold or greater increase in Ca content was produced) and were associated with significant LDH release. We conclude that these cells are resistant to cell injury caused by moderately severe Ca overload and ATP depletion produced by exposure to CN and 2-DG. However, metabolic inhibition of ATP production produces persistent abnormalities in K homeostasis, associated with functional abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of contraction of the diaphragm on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, we studied eight healthy volunteers during spontaneous breathing, maximal inspiration, and graded inspiratory efforts against a closed airway (Muller's maneuver). Electrical activity of the crural diaphragm (DEMG) was recorded from bipolar esophageal electrodes, transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) was calculated as the difference between gastric and esophageal pressures, and LES pressure was recorded using a sleeve device. During spontaneous breathing, phasic inspiratory DEMG was accompanied by phasic increases in Pdi and LES pressure. With maximal inspiration, DEMG increased 15-20-fold compared with spontaneous inspiration, and LES pressure rose from an end-expiratory pressure of 21 to 90 mmHg. Similar values were obtained during maximal Muller's maneuvers. LES pressure fell promptly when the diaphragm relaxed. Graded Muller's maneuver resulted in proportional increases in the Pdi, LES pressure, and DEMG. The LES pressure was always greater than Pdi and correlated with it in a linear fashion (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the contraction of the diaphragm exerts a sphincteric action at the LES, and that this effect is an important component of the antireflux barrier.\r"

Phosphates and pH were measured in adductor pollicis using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance at 2.0 Tesla. The force of muscle contraction was simultaneously measured with a force transducer. The effects of aerobic and anaerobic exercise were compared using two exercise protocols: 4 min sustained maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and 40 min of repeated intermittent contractions (75% MVC). The sustained maximal contraction produced a rapid decline of MVC and PCr, and was accompanied by a rapid rise of Pi, H+, and H2PO4-. Intermittent exercise produced steady state changes of MVC, pH, and phosphates. No significant changes of ATP were found in either protocol. During fatiguing exercise, PCr and Pi had a nonlinear relationship with MVC. H+ showed a more linear correlation, while H2PO4- showed the best correlation with MVC. Furthermore, the correlations between MVC and H2PO4- were similar in sustained (r = 0.70) and intermittent (r = 0.73) exercise. The highly significant linear relationship between increases of H+ and H2PO4- and the decline of MVC strongly suggests that both H+ and H2PO4- are important determinants of human muscle fatigue.\r"

In contrast to another H-ATPase (gastric H-K-ATPase), the renal enzyme is not stimulated by K+ and is not inhibited by vanadate. However, our preliminary observations indicated that a K-stimulated ATPase (K-ATPase) sensitive to inhibition by vanadate is present in renal medullary collecting duct (MCD). To localize and further characterize this renal tubular K-ATPase, we measured K-ATPase activity in eight specific segments of the rabbit nephron. K-ATPase activity was the difference in ATPase activity in the presence and absence of KCl but in the presence of ouabain (to inhibit Na-K-ATPase). ATPase activity was determined by a fluorometric microassay in which ATP hydrolysis is coupled to the oxidation of NADH. There was a significant K-ATPase activity (expressed as pmol.min-1.mm-1) in the connecting tubule (CNT, 17.0 +/- 3.3), cortical collecting duct (CCD, 6.6 +/- 0.7), and MCD (8.8 +/- 1.7), but not in the proximal segments and the thick ascending limbs. The renal tubular K-ATPase was not only inhibited by vanadate but also by omeprazole and SCH 28080 (relatively specific inhibitors of gastric H-K-ATPase). It is concluded that K-ATPase present in the CNT, CCD, and MCD has some properties in common with gastric H-K-ATPase. However, the physiological role of K-ATPase in the distal nephron segments remains to be elucidated.\r"

Analysis of Hb F in the erythroblasts present at the end of suspension cultures and in the erythroid colonies formed from treated progenitors showed that 1 X 10(-9)-5 X 10(-8) M 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine produced a concentration-related increase in the proportion of Hb F-positive erythroblasts, of Hb F-positive erythroid CFU (CFUe) colonies, and at the higher doses used, an increased Hb F expression in erythroid burst-forming unit (BFUe)-derived colonies. Preincubation of bone marrow cells with Ara-C produced significant megaloblastic changes by the end of the 2-d incubation and increased the proportion of Hb F-positive erythroblasts, CFUe colonies, and e-clusters, but BFUe-derived progeny was unaffected. Hydroxyurea failed to produce significant changes in Hb F at the range of concentrations used. The data raise the possibility of more than one mechanism underlying the stimulation of Hb F by S-stage drugs.\r"

  ".W": "\"Perinatal\" hypophosphatasia is the most severe form of this inborn error of metabolism, which is characterized by deficient activity of the tissue-nonspecific (liver/bone/kidney) isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (TNSALP). We report that autopsy tissue from three affected subjects, which was profoundly low in ALP activity, had essentially unremarkable levels of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxal, and total vitamin B6 content despite markedly elevated plasma PLP levels (5,800, 14,500, and 98,500 nM; adult norm, 5-109 nM). Our findings help to explain the general absence of symptoms of vitamin B6 excess or deficiency in hypophosphatasia, and provide evidence that TNSALP acts as an ectoenzyme to regulate extracellular rather than intracellular concentrations of PLP (the cofactor form of vitamin B6) and perhaps other phosphate compounds.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species in hepatocytes or reticuloendothelial cells may cause ischemia-reperfusion injury was tested in isolated perfused livers of male Fischer rats. GSSG was measured in perfusate, bile, and tissue as a sensitive index of oxidative stress. After a preperfusion phase of 30 min, the perfusion was stopped (global ischemia) for various times (30, 120 min) and the liver was reperfused for another 60 min. The bile flow (1.48 +/- 0.17 microliters/min X gram liver weight), the biliary efflux of total glutathione (6.54 +/- 0.94 nmol GSH eq/min X g), and GSSG (1.59 +/- 0.23 nmol GSH eq/min X g) recovered to 69-86% after short-term ischemia and to 36-72% after 2 h of ischemia when compared with values obtained from control livers perfused for the same period of time. During reperfusion, the sinusoidal efflux of total glutathione (16.4 +/- 2.1 nmol GSH eq/min X g) and GSSG (0.13 +/- 0.05 nmol GSH eq/min X g) did not change except for an initial 10-30-s increase during reperfusion washout. No increased GSSG secretion into bile was detectable at any time during reperfusion. The liver content of total glutathione (32.5 +/- 3.5 nmol GSH eq/mg protein) and GSSG (0.27 +/- 0.09 nmol GSH eq/mg protein) did not change significantly during any period of ischemia or reperfusion. We conclude, therefore, that at most only a minor amount of reactive oxygen species were generated during reperfusion. Thus, reactive oxygen species are unlikely to cause ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat liver by lipid peroxidation or tissue thiol oxidation.\r"

  ".W": "When a suspension of rabbit proximal tubules is subjected to anoxia, ATP falls by 80-90% during 40 min of anoxia, and upon reoxygenation (reox) the cells only recover 25-50% of their initial ATP. Addition of Mg-ATP (magnesium chloride-treated ATP), Mg-ADP, or Mg-AMP (five aliquots of 200 nmol/ml added 10 min apart) during anoxia causes complete recovery of ATP levels, and respiratory and transport function after 40 min of reox. Similar additions of adenosine (ADO), or inosine (INO), or Mg-ATP only during reox are less effective. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release after 40 min of anoxia is 30-40% under control conditions, only 10-15% when adenine nucleotides or ADO are added during anoxia, and 20% when INO is added, suggesting that these additions may stabilize the plasma membrane during anoxia and help preserve cellular integrity. During reox, recovery may depend on the entry of ATP precursors and, therefore, we explored the mechanism whereby exogenous ATP increases the intracellular ATP content. Additions of Mg-ATP, Mg-ADP, or Mg-AMP to continuously oxygenated tubules increase cellular ATP content three- to fourfold in 1 h. The added ATP and ADP are rapidly degraded to AMP, and more slowly to ADO, INO, and hypoxanthine. Furthermore, the ATP-induced increase in cellular ATP is abolished by the exogenous addition of adenosine deaminase, which converts extracellular ADO to INO. These results suggest that the increase in cellular ATP requires extracellular ADO. The ADO obtained from the breakdown of AMP may be preferentially transported into the renal cells to be resynthesized into cellular AMP and ATP.\r"

  ".U": "88170060\r", 
  ".W": "Numerous studies have suggested that epinephrine may facilitate neural release of NE. There have been no studies in humans that demonstrate the functional significance of this action. To determine whether epinephrine facilitates neurogenic vasoconstriction in humans, we contrasted forearm vasoconstrictor responses to a reflex stimulus (lower body negative pressure [LBNP]) and to intraarterial NE before, during, and 30 min after infusion of epinephrine (50 ng/min) or isoproterenol (10 or 25 ng/min) into a brachial artery. These doses had no systemic effects. We reasoned that if prejunctional stimulation of beta receptors by epinephrine and isoproterenol had functional significance, the vasoconstrictor response to LBNP would be potentiated in comparison to the response to NE (postjunctional mechanism). Studies were done on 23 normal male volunteers. Forearm blood flow was measured with a strain gauge plethysmograph and intraarterial pressure was recorded. The ratio of vasoconstrictor responses to LBNP/NE was used as an index of neural release of the neurotransmitter NE. This ratio increased during infusions of both epinephrine and isoproterenol. 30 min after epinephrine the vasoconstrictor response to LBNP (n = 15) was augmented from +9.9 +/- 2.2 (SE) resistance units (RU) before epinephrine to +16.4 +/- 3.2 RU (P less than 0.05); whereas the response to NE (n = 8) tended to decrease from +8.8 +/- 3.1 RU before to +4.2 +/- 1.2 RU after epinephrine (P greater than 0.05). In contrast, 30 min after isoproterenol the vasoconstrictor responses to LBNP and NE were the same as before isoproterenol. The augmented ratio of responses to LBNP/NE after epinephrine and not after isoproterenol supports the concept that epinephrine, but not isoproterenol, is taken up by the adrenergic terminal, is released subsequently during reflex stimulation, and augments the release of the neurotransmitter NE. These experiments provide the first hemodynamic evidence in humans that epinephrine and isoproterenol facilitate neurogenic vasoconstriction. The sustained effect of epinephrine in contrast to isoproterenol suggests that the late facilitation by epinephrine is related to its neural uptake and subsequent release.\r"

  ".W": "Regional variations in the ion transport properties of the colon may have significant physiological and pathophysiological implications. However, only limited studies have been performed in cecum, which comprises 50% of the macrosurface of the rabbit colon. In vitro under short-circuit conditions, cecum actively absorbed Na and Cl (JnetNa = 5.6 +/- 0.3, JnetCl = 1.5 +/- 0.3 mu eq.cm-2.h-1) with a short-circuit current (Isc) of 6.29 +/- 0.2 mu eq.cm-2.h-1.Cl substitution with sulfate decreased both JnetNa and Isc by 1.3 mu eq/cm2.h-1.HCO3 removal decreased both JnetNa and Isc 3.3 mu eq.cm-2.h-1. This effect was due primarily to removal of serosal HCO3. There was both a linear correlation between JNanet and Isc (r = 0.845) and a concentration-dependent stimulation of Isc by increasing [Na] in the bathing media. However, 10(-4) M amiloride did not significantly alter either Isc or JnetNa. In contrast, 10(-4) M phenamil, an amiloride analogue highly specific for the Na channel, significantly blocked both Isc and JnetNa. The sulfhydryl reagent PCMBS increased Isc; this response was reversed by phenamil. Electrogenic Cl secretion was stimulated by 1 mM theophylline, 10(-4) M 8BrcAMP and 10(-4) M 8BrcGMP. None of the secretagogues inhibited JnetNa. Epinephrine (5.5 microM) increased JnetNa from 5.9 +/- 1.3 to 7.8 +/- 1.1 (P = 0.02) and JnetCl from 0.1 +/- 1.2 to 2.0 +/- 0.8 (P NS) mu eq.cm-2.h-1. Studies of pH stat demonstrated an epinephrine-stimulated increase in Jm-sHCO3 without a change in Js-mHCO3. Thus, cecum exhibits a distinct type of electrogenic Na electrogenic Na absorption which is partially dependent on the presence of Cl and HCO3, not blocked by amiloride but by phenamil. Because of its large surface area and its novel mechanism of electrogenic Na transport, the cecum exerts an important regulatory role in colonic fluid and electrolyte balance.\r"

The subjects had normal antigenic concentrations of antithrombin and normal progressive inhibitory activity. However, the variant had defective heparin and heparan sulfate cofactor activities, and was not activated by a synthetic pentasaccharide representing the minimum heparin sequence. The abnormal antithrombin was isolated using heparin-Sepharose chromatography, and on electrophoresis at pH 8.6 migrated more anodally than normal. Two-dimensional peptide mapping of tryptic and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digests was performed and the abnormal peptide was located by tryptophan staining. Amino acid sequence studies demonstrated a substitution of arginine at residue 47 by a serine. Evidence strongly suggests that arginine 47 is a prime heparin binding site in antithrombin and that it forms part of a proposed positively charged linear site (to which heparin binds) that stretches across the surface of the molecule from the A to the D helix.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the renal tubular sites and mechanisms involved in the effects of hypooncotic volume expansion (VE) on renal electrolyte excretion, we performed clearance and isolated tubular perfusion studies using intact and thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rabbits. We also examined the effect of VE on luminal brush border transport. In the microperfusion studies, proximal convoluted (PCT) and straight (PST) tubules were taken from rabbits without prior VE or after 30 min of 6% (body wt) VE. Acute VE increased the percentage excretion of Na, Ca, and P in TPTX animals and the percentage and absolute excretions of these ions in intact rabbits. In PST from VE animals, fluid flux (Jv) was depressed compared with Jv in PST from nonVE rabbits: Jv = 0.18 +/- 0.03, (VE) vs. 0.31 +/- 0.03 nl/mm.min, (nonVE) P less than 0.02. Phosphate transport (Jp) in the PST from VE animals was also depressed: JP = 1.58 +/- 0.10 (VE) vs. 2.62 +/- 0.47 pmol/mm.min, (nonVE) P less than 0.05. Similar results were obtained with TPTX animals. In the PCT from VE animals, Jv was decreased (0.49 +/- 0.10 (VE) vs. 0.97 +/- 0.14 nl/mm.min, (nonVE) P less than 0.02), but JP was not affected significantly. Transport inhibition was stable over approximately 90 min of perfusion. In the brush border vesicle studies, sodium-dependent phosphate transport was inhibited compared with that in control animals, at the 9-, 30-, and 60-s time points. These findings indicate that the inhibition of renal ionic transport by VE occurs in both PCT and PST and is, in part, the result of a direct effect of VE on tubular transport mechanisms.\r"

C4d standard (100%) was produced by exhaustive activation of the classical pathway in pooled normal human serum using heat aggregated human immunoglobulin. Serial dilutions of the standard provided a reference curve against which clinical samples were read. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed significantly higher C4d values (mean 53.8%) than controls (21.7%; p less than 0.001). The technique proved accurate, rapid, and suitable for the routine laboratory evaluation of complement activation through the classical pathway, and it may be useful in the management of those conditions in which complement activation has a pathogenic role.\r"

In serum pools with raised total alkaline phosphatase activity errors in recovered intestinal activity were small (usually less than 3 U/l) when intestinal alkaline phosphatase was added. Much larger errors and many underestimated results were found using L-phenylalanine.

The incidence of Weeksella virosa was found to be 2% in the first two groups. This suggests that, irrespective of the presence of pathogens, the incidence of the species in the general female population is around 2%. A much higher incidence (15%) was found in the third group, suggesting sexual transmission of the organism.\r"

Two of these patients experienced a reduction of this leukodermic defect, whereas the remaining patients showed a stable clinical course. Dopa and Fontana stains disclosed, in most cases, decreased but not absent functional melanocytes and a marked reduction of melanin. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated slight to severe damage of keratinocytes and melanocytes similar to that previously reported in vitiligo patients. The phototoxic effect of PUVASOL therapy is suggested as a possible etiologic factor in these patients. A probable relationship among idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis, leukoderma punctata, and vitiligo is discussed.\r"

A strong association has been established between infection by HPV 16 and HPV 18 and the subsequent development of cancer in the uterine cervix. Therefore, a clinical challenge exists with respect to identification of patients harboring the latter type of high-risk HPV types. The present study on 108 men with genitoanal warts focuses on whether reliable gross and/or histopathologic criteria exist to predict the presence of HPV 16 and HPV 18 or whether there is a need for HPV typing by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hybridization assay in future epidemiologic studies. The high-risk HPV types were identified in 9 of 91 HPV DNA-positive lesions (11%). The gross appearance of the lesions appeared to be of limited predictive value for the presence of these HPV types. HPV 16 was most common in warts exhibiting some degree of dysplasia (p less than 0.001) and also occurred in the two lesions with a severe dysplasia. Lack of dysplasia correlated with the presence of HPV 6 and/or 11 (p less than 0.01). However, absence of dysplasia did not preclude infection with high-risk HPV types, and a mild to moderate dysplasia was associated with all of the four HPV types studied. Therefore, we emphasize the value of HPV typing in clinical routine in order to trace men harboring the high-risk HPV types 16 and/or 18.\r"

Healing occurred without systemic corticosteroid therapy in all but three patients. All patients had clinical pyoderma gangrenosum. In five patients the lesion occurred after surgery of the skin. Histopathologic study of 40 biopsy specimens showed focal neutrophilic abscesses of the papillary dermis, often with peripheral palisading histiocytes and foreign-body giant cells. Pseudoepitheliomatous, vegetative hyperplasia and sinus tract formation were observed frequently. All patient had massive areas of plasmacytosis, and 13 had eosinophils. Granulation tissue, hemorrhage, and fibrosis were additional features in some areas. Foreign material in the lesions was considered unimportant, except in one patient with a starch granuloma. Therapy with local corticosteroids, minocycline, tetracycline, or sulfa drugs resulted in healing in 15 patients. We believe that we have identified a localized, limited form of chronic superficial pyoderma gangrenosum with verrucous and ulcerative lesions and a granulomatous histologic appearance that represents a unique pattern of this disease in some patients.\r"

There is currently no treatment that reverses the atrophic changes associated with this lesion. We have carried out a clinicopathologic study on 15 subjects and, in addition, have reviewed 10 further biopsy specimens of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. We found a frequent association of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum with other chronic complications of diabetes mellitus, including limited joint mobility. It is possible that nonenzymatic glucosylation or other changes in collagen may be important in the etiology of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum and the limited joint mobility. We confirmed that cutaneous anesthesia is usually present in the necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum lesions. With the use of an antibody to S100 protein and an immunohistochemical method, there was an apparent decreased number of nerves in the skin lesions. We suggest that sensory loss results from local destruction of cutaneous nerves by the inflammatory process. Finally, in six elliptical biopsies extending into clinically normal skin, we demonstrated that the inflammatory infiltrate of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum extended from the lesion into apparently normal skin surrounding clinically active lesions. Thus, intradermal steroids might be administered to perilesional areas surrounding active lesions in the hope of halting progression.\r"

An average of 6 months elapsed between patients' recognition of a new or changed lesion and their realization that the lesion was suspicious. For 21% of cases, at least 2 months elapsed between physicians' observation of lesions and a definitive diagnosis of malignant melanoma, and 13% were diagnosed a minimum of 4 months following a visit to the physician. Patients routinely cannot distinguish between melanomas and moles. Physicians do not always diagnose melanoma accurately or act promptly in response to suspicious lesions.

Univariate correlates of a second restenosis were an interval between the first and second angioplasty less than 5 months (41 versus 20% of patients had restenosis, p less than 0.01), male gender (35 versus 12%, p less than 0.05), lesions length greater than or equal to 15 mm before the second angioplasty (62 versus 28%, p less than 0.05), diameter stenosis greater than 90% before the second angioplasty (67 versus 29%, p less than 0.05), final gradient greater than 20 mm Hg after the second angioplasty (52 versus 28%, p less than 0.05) and an additional site requiring dilation at the time of the second angioplasty (50 versus 29%, p = 0.10). Multivariate predictors of a second restenosis were an interval of less than 5 months between the first and the second angioplasty (p = 0.001), male gender (p = 0.001), lesion length greater than or equal to 15 mm before the second angioplasty (p = 0.001) and the need to have an additional site dilated at the time of the second angioplasty (p = 0.002).

The diagnosis was made by the following studies: sputum culture (n = 4), culture of pericardial fluid obtained by pericardiocentesis (n = 3), histologic study and culture of pericardial biopsy (n = 3), lymph node biopsy (n = 2) and pleural biopsy (n = 1). Clinical presentation was remarkably variable: four patients had an acute, apparently self-limited course, one had relapsing tamponade, four had tamponade effectively treated with pericardiocentesis and four had toxic symptoms with persistent fever. The interval from hospital admission to diagnosis ranged from 1 to 14 weeks (mean 5.2). Constrictive pericarditis developed in six patients and effusive-constrictive pericarditis in one; all seven required pericardiectomy 2 to 3.5 months after admission. No patient died. It is concluded that 1) tuberculous pericarditis has a variable clinical presentation and therefore it should be considered in the evaluation of all instances of pericarditis without a rapidly self-limited course; 2) the diagnosis should be based only on objective data obtained with a systematic study protocol; 3) early definitive diagnosis is still difficult to achieve; and 4) development of subacute constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy is common.\r"

The same protocol was repeated in 17 patients 5 to 10 min after completion of coronary angioplasty. In 13 patients with normal coronary angiograms, peak contrast intensity corrected for background myocardial intensity was measured in 36 regions and was found to increase after papaverine from 36 +/- 16 to 55 +/- 22 U (p less than 0.001). In contrast, in the 27 patients with angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease, peak intensity in 64 regions remained unchanged after papaverine (35 +/- 22 versus 36 +/- 23 U). An increase in peak intensity greater than or equal to 10 U was 80% sensitive and 92% specific for coronary artery disease. After successful coronary angioplasty, peak intensity in the involved regions improved significantly (p less than 0.001) during baseline contrast injections (from 32 +/- 16 to 50 +/- 25 U) as well as in the postpapaverine contrast injections (from 30 +/- 12 to 60 +/- 26 U). In conclusion, measurement of peak contrast intensity after intracoronary injections of sonicated meglumine provides a relative index of myocardial perfusion that allows assessment of regional coronary reserve in patients with coronary artery disease. This may be of particular value in evaluating the immediate effects of coronary angioplasty on myocardial perfusion.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of changes in coronary stenosis on left ventricular diastolic filling, diastolic filling was serially examined before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty using pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 50 patients with stable exertional angina pectoris. Peak rapid filling velocity and the ratio of peak atrial filling to peak rapid filling velocities were measured from the transmitral flow velocity pattern before and 2 and 9 days after coronary angioplasty. Peak rapid filling velocity increased and the ratio of peak atrial filling to peak rapid filling velocities decreased gradually after coronary angioplasty. The improvement in left ventricular diastolic filling was greater in patients with severe (greater than 90%) coronary stenosis than in patients with mild (less than or equal to 90%) coronary stenosis. In the long-term follow-up period, the improved left ventricular diastolic filling worsened in only 11 patients with marked progression to greater than 90% coronary stenosis. Thus, left ventricular diastolic filling improved gradually after coronary angioplasty, possibly reflecting post-ischemic \"stunned\" myocardium. Serial examinations of left ventricular diastolic filling with pulsed Doppler echocardiography may be a means of noninvasively assessing the temporal changes in the coronary stenosis and predicting the occurrence of coronary restenosis after coronary angioplasty.\r"

To determine the accuracy and reliability of the peak Doppler flow velocity signal for measuring the peak pressure gradient in this condition, 340 beats were analyzed from five consecutive patients studied with simultaneous continuous wave Doppler ultrasound and dual catheter pressure recordings across the left ventricular outflow tract. Each patient was studied at steady state and during physiologic and pharmacologic manipulations of the pressure gradient. Peak velocity and calculated peak gradient were determined by two independent observers who did not know the catheter measurements. In addition, 18 beats with well defined flow velocity envelopes were digitized for analysis of the magnitude, timing and contour of the instantaneous Doppler ultrasound and catheter gradients throughout systole. Peak catheter gradient in the 340 beats ranged from 12 to 245 mm Hg. The correlations between the Doppler-derived and catheter peak gradients were close (r = 0.96, SEE = 4 mm Hg for Observer 1 and r = 0.97, SEE = 11 mm Hg for Observer 2). Interobserver variability for measurement of peak flow velocity was small (mean +/- SD 0.16 +/- 0.15 m/s). An interobserver difference greater than 0.3 m/s occurred in 25 of the 340 beats analyzed. By retrospective analysis, this was due to contamination of the outflow tract signal by mitral regurgitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Left-sided cardiac catheterization was performed to determine the severity of mitral incompetence and aortic regurgitation semiquantitatively. In healthy subjects and in patients without valve disease, stroke volumes were nearly identical with the two methods and the correlation was high (r = 0.98 [p less than 0.001]). The mean regurgitation fraction was 13% in patients with mild mitral incompetence and 2+ aortic regurgitation, 37% in patients with moderate mitral incompetence and 3+ aortic regurgitation and 57% in patients with severe mitral incompetence and 4+ aortic regurgitation. These findings suggest that combined first pass and gated equilibrium radionuclide cardiography, being insensitive to intracardiac shunts and right-sided valve disorders, constitutes a valid noninvasive technique for quantitation of left-sided cardiac valve regurgitation.\r"

  ".W": "Three patients who had incessant ventricular tachycardia and in whom a zone of slow conduction was identified are presented. Each patient's tachycardia was refractory to multiple antiarrhythmic drugs and was being treated with amiodarone at the time of the electrophysiologic study. The ventricular tachycardia cycle length was 500 to 580 ms. In Patients 1 and 2, a single site at the posterolateral wall or low septum in the left ventricle was identified at which overdrive pacing during ventricular tachycardia resulted in ventricular capture with a stimulus to QRS interval of 280 to 400 ms and with little or no change in the configuration of the QRS complexes during pacing as compared with during ventricular tachycardia. In Patient 3, the same phenomenon was observed at two areas in the left ventricle: at the inferior wall, overdrive pacing during ventricular tachycardia resulted in a stimulus to QRS interval of 440 to 470 ms, whereas at the posterolateral wall, the stimulus to QRS interval was 320 to 360 ms. Transcatheter shocks of 100 to 240 J delivered at the pacing sites have been successful in preventing recurrences of ventricular tachycardia over a follow-up period of 10 to 11 months. These observations may be explained by the pacing site being located within a reentrant circuit in a zone of slow conduction bounded by inexcitable tissue between the pacing site and the exit site of the reentrant circuit. In Patient 3, the variable stimulus to QRS intervals are explained by variable proximity of the pacing sites within the slow conduction zone to the exit site of the reentrant circuit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Introduction of the balloon through a left atriotomy and across the mitral valve allowed endocardial activation maps to be obtained in the intact left ventricle. Of 20 patients with coronary artery disease studied in this way, suggestive evidence of endocardial reentry was found in 6. Three separate reentrant mechanisms were observed. In two patients, a single broad wave front of continuous recirculating activation reminiscent of a vortex was initiated by the formation of a functional arc of block in response to premature stimuli. In five patients, premature stimuli again produced a functional arc of block, which was circumvented by two opposing wave fronts that united on the distal side. Retrograde penetration by a narrow isthmus of slow conduction through the block initiated the tachycardia, whose activation sequence was consistent with figure eight reentry. In one patient, premature stimuli produced a region of delayed potentials. Critical timing of these resulted in microreentry in an adjacent circumscribed site, which formed the site of origin of the ensuing tachycardia. The microreentrant signals were not detected by standard unipolar recordings, but were seen on simultaneously recorded high gain electrograms. In 14 patients, although mapping identified a site of origin, the activation patterns showed either radial spread or incomplete circles. Detection of reentrant mechanisms during intraoperative mapping required high density electrode arrays and refined high gain recordings. An intact ventricle may facilitate intraoperative initiation of tachycardia.\r"

Left atrial systolic time interval indexes included atrial pre-ejection period (the time between the onset of an electrocardiographic P wave and the onset of left ventricular inflow during atrial systole [A wave]), corrected atrial pre-ejection period (the atrial pre-ejection period divided by the duration of the P wave), and atrial ejection time (the time between the onset and cessation of the A wave). Twenty-one patients with a fourth heart sound on the phonocardiogram had a shorter atrial pre-ejection period (81 +/- 10 versus 89 +/- 14 ms p less than 0.05) and a corrected atrial pre-ejection period (66 +/- 17 versus 83 +/- 18 ms, p less than 0.01), as well as a longer atrial ejection time (147 +/- 15 versus 126 +/- 13 ms, p less than 0.001) than did 26 patients without a fourth heart sound. The ratio of atrial pre-ejection period to atrial ejection time and that of corrected atrial pre-ejection period to atrial ejection time was smaller in patients with than in patients without a fourth heart sound (0.56 +/- 0.08 versus 0.71 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.001; 0.46 +/- 0.16 ms-1 versus 0.67 +/- 0.17 ms-1, p less than 0.001, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During exercise, an overall decrease from 6.4 +/- 1.9 to 5.6 +/- 1.9 mV (-11%) in the atrial signal amplitude was noted. Despite considerable variability among patients, marked changes occurred in 15 patients whose signals diminished by 11 to 49%. Slew rates showed a similar decrease from 1.35 +/- 0.45 to 1.18 +/- 0.45 V/s (-10.8%), with individual changes of as much as -51%. Signal attenuation in the time domain correlated well with frequency data, exhibiting a highly significant reduction of signal energy between 25 and 105 Hz. However, spectral distribution changed from rest to exercise, with a relative increase of signal energy in the range between 5 and 25 Hz and a decrease at higher frequencies. Individual changes differed widely when low (15 to 65 Hz) and high (65 to 115 Hz) frequencies were compared, but in a group of 11 patients signal attenuation in the high frequency band was more pronounced (-45%) than in the low frequency band (-23%). The clinical impact of the change in frequency distribution during ergometry was visualized by computer simulation of two different (low and high bandpass) filters. Although in individual patients, both characteristics may be favorable with respect to atrial sensing, it was observed in 11 patients that high pass filtering attenuates signal amplitudes by 10 to 24% in excess of the variation without filtering.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-six percutaneous transluminal balloon valvuloplasty procedures were performed in 51 patients suffering from congenital pulmonary valve stenosis. The patients ranged in age from 1 day to 60 years (mean 6.9 years); 21 were infants less than 1 year of age, including 8 neonates. The peak systolic pressure gradient was greater than 50 mm Hg (mean 81.5) in 47 cases, and less than 50 mm Hg (mean 34.6) in 9. Valvuloplasty enabled a reduction in the mean right ventricular peak systolic pressure from 93.1 to 51.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), the mean transvalvular gradient from 73.4 to 27.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and the mean right ventricular pressure expressed as a percent of systemic pressure from 99.5 to 52.0% (p less than 0.001). In infants and neonates, the mean right ventricular pressure expressed as a percent of systemic pressure decreased from 117.3 to 64.4% (p less than 0.001). In 23 patients, follow-up cardiac catheterization at 1 to 17 months revealed a significant change in the right ventricular systolic pressure, which decreased from 54.0 to 46.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), and in the peak systolic pressure gradient, which decreased from 27.3 to 22.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Valvuloplasty is an effective procedure in relieving pulmonary stenosis in patients of all ages, including neonates.\r"

  ".U": "88170403\r", 
  ".W": "Although balloon dilation of valvular pulmonary stenosis is established in infants and children, the techniques for and results of balloon dilation in neonates with critical pulmonary stenosis remain largely unreported. Since January 1, 1985, six successive neonates with critical pulmonary stenosis (aged 1 to 6 days) underwent attempted balloon dilation. Each was cyanotic and three of the six were on prostaglandin E1 therapy and three required tracheal intubation and ventilation. All had suprasystemic right ventricular pressures (mean 122.8 +/- 6.8 mm Hg). After hemodynamic evaluation and right ventricular angiography, the valve was crossed in five patients, and was first dilated with a low profile, 5 or 6 mm diameter, 2 cm long balloon. At least one more balloon was used in each patient, the largest being 95 to 133% of the diameter of the pulmonary valve anulus. The anulus size was 6.8 +/- 1.1 mm and the largest balloon size used was 6 to 10 mm. Right ventricular pressure decreased to nearly systemic level or less in five of five patients (58.8 +/- 6.7 mm Hg). Pressure gradients, measured in four infants, were 7, 12, 16 and 35 mm Hg, respectively, but were unreliable indicators of obstruction because of a patent ductus arteriosus. The five patients were discharged 3 to 8 days after balloon dilation. All are currently symptom free 10.6 +/- 11.7 months later, and all but one are believed clinically to have mild obstruction. Complications included iliac vein occlusion (n = 1) and complete right bundle branch block (n = 1). Although follow-up has been brief, neonates with critical pulmonary stenosis can safely undergo balloon dilation, usually with good short-term results.\r"

  ".U": "88170404\r", 
  ".W": "Doppler echocardiographic determination of the pulmonary to systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) ratio requires calculation of pulmonary artery and aortic luminal areas and integrals of the Doppler systolic velocity curves. To simplify the Doppler calculation of the Qp/Qs ratio, the square of the ratio of pulmonary to aortic luminal diameters, substituted for the ratio of vessel areas, was multiplied by the ratio of pulmonary to aortic peak flow velocities, substituted for the ratio of velocity time integrals. The Qp/Qs ratios were calculated by both the conventional and the simplified Doppler method in 42 children, 1 month to 16 years of age. Fifteen children had no evidence of shunt and 27 had an intracardiac left to right shunt at the atrial or ventricular level, or both. In children with a shunt, the Qp/Qs ratio obtained at cardiac catheterization by oximetry ranged from 1.4:1 to 4.3:1. Both the conventional and the simplified Doppler Qp/Qs ratios correlated well with the oximetric Qp/Qs ratios (r = 0.94 and 0.93, respectively). Since the pulmonary to aortic luminal area ratio and velocity time integral ratio varied in each patient, neither measurement alone correlated well with the oximetric Qp/Qs ratio and, therefore, neither alone could be used as an estimate of the Qp/Qs ratio. The simplified Doppler calculation of the Qp/Qs ratio, which requires less time and no computer facilities, provides an excellent estimate of the Qp/Qs ratio in children.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of definitive operation for Ebstein's anomaly on rest and exercise cardiorespiratory function, cycle exercise studies were performed on 38 patients with Ebstein's anomaly before definitive operation and on 11 patients after operation. An atrial septal defect was present in 29 of the 38 preoperative patients and in none of the postoperative patients. Seven of the postoperative patients had tricuspid valvuloplasty and four had valve replacement. Exercise tolerance, as defined by maximal oxygen uptake, was significantly greater in patients after operation for Ebstein's anomaly than in the preoperative patients. However, exercise tolerance for preoperative patients without an atrial septal defect was similar to that for postoperative patients. Tricuspid valve repair or replacement appeared to affect favorably cardiac output response to exercise. Rest systemic arterial oxygen saturation increased from 88 to 95% and exercise saturation from 77 to 93% after operation. Rest ventilatory equivalent for oxygen decreased from 48 +/- 13 preoperatively to 37 +/- 6 postoperatively, and exercise ventilatory equivalent for oxygen decreased from 53 +/- 23 preoperatively to 38 +/- 6 postoperatively. Definitive operation (tricuspid valvuloplasty or replacement and atrial septal defect closure) for Ebstein's anomaly results in significant improvement of exercise tolerance, normalization of systemic arterial oxygen saturation and reduction of excess ventilation at rest and during exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The short-term effects of sublingual nifedipine (20 mg) on cardiac output and its distribution at rest and during exercise were evaluated by measurement of iliofemoral blood flow and cardiac output in 10 men with stable angina pectoris controlled by metoprolol. At rest, nifedipine significantly decreased iliofemoral vascular resistance from 294 +/- 36 to 165 +/- 29 dynes.s.cm-5.10(2) (p less than 0.01) and significantly increased iliofemoral blood flow from 0.34 +/- 0.04 to 0.57 +/- 0.11 liters/min (p less than 0.05). Systemic vascular resistance was reduced from 19 +/- 1 to 13 +/- 1 dynes.s.cm-5.10(2) (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output increased significantly from 4.7 +/- 0.3 to 5.8 +/- 0.5 liters/min (p less than 0.05). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly and heart rate increased significantly. During maximal upright bicycle exercise during nifedipine therapy, iliofemoral vascular resistance and leg blood flow were unchanged compared with control (23 +/- 2 versus 21 +/- 3 dynes.s.cm-5.10(2) and 4.7 +/- 0.5 versus 4.4 +/- 0.6 liters/min), cardiac output remained significantly increased (12.8 +/- 0.8 to 15.2 +/- 1.2 liters/min, p less than 0.05) and systemic vascular resistance remained significantly reduced (8 +/- 1 to 5 +/- 1 dynes.s.cm-5.10(2); p less than 0.001). The proportion of cardiac output distributed to the working lower limbs was significantly reduced at all exercise levels. In summary, nifedipine caused a redistribution of cardiac output by vasodilating nonexercising vascular beds without altering the locally mediated vasodilation in exercising muscle. In patients with coronary artery disease given nifedipine therapy, an increase in exercise tolerance is due to relief of myocardial ischemia rather than to increased peripheral oxygen delivery.\r"

During dose ranging, patients received placebo followed by 50, 75 and 100 mg of indecainide three times daily. Eight of the 10 patients achieved greater than or equal to 80% reduction in ventricular ectopic depolarizations during inpatient therapy. Mean ventricular ectopic depolarizations decreased from 15,792/24 h to 2,357/24 h on optimal dosage (p less than 0.01). Nine patients had paired ventricular ectopic depolarizations; four of the nine had greater than or equal to 99% reduction of these beats. Among seven patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, five had 100% elimination of these events with indecainide and all had greater than or equal to 90% reduction in these events. Indecainide prolonged the PR interval 44 +/- 27 ms (p less than 0.0001) and the QRS interval 11 +/- 9 ms (p less than 0.0001) from baseline without prolongation of the QTc or JTc interval. The mean trough plasma level of indecainide on optimal dosage was 409 +/- 173 ng/ml and the mean plasma elimination half-life was 10.3 +/- 2.3 h (range 7.1 to 14.2). No adverse hemodynamic effects of indecainide were detected. Side effects during short-term therapy were mild and did not require discontinuation of the drug. Efficacy was maintained for some patients during long-term therapy for 2 years, although five patients discontinued therapy because of loss of efficacy or side effects. Indecainide is a highly effective and well tolerated antiarrhythmic drug for suppression of frequent and repetitive ventricular ectopic depolarizations.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to test the accuracy of echocardiographic radial shortening measurements during variable degrees of regional dysfunction produced by 14 transient (less than or equal to 10 min) coronary occlusions (8 left anterior descending coronary artery, 6 left circumflex coronary artery) followed by up to 24 h of reperfusion in chronically instrumented conscious dogs. Independent measurement of regional myocardial thickening was obtained using epicardial pulsed Doppler probes and served as a standard for comparison. Radial shortening fraction was derived from two-dimensional short-axis views along 12 equidistant radii. Six reference systems from the epicardial and endocardial centers of geometry (centroids) in a fixed or a floating position were explored. In the ischemic zone, percent thickening fraction averaged 22 +/- 5% at baseline, decreased to -4 +/- 4% during occlusion and gradually returned to baseline values after reperfusion. Percent change in radial shortening correlated significantly with percent change in thickening fraction in the ischemic zone. The worst correlation was seen with the floating endocardial centroid (r = 0.68), and the best was observed with the epicardial floating reference (r = 0.91). Moreover, the epicardial floating reference provided narrower 95% confidence limits of radial shortening and less heterogeneity among radii than did fixed reference systems. Thus, compared with an independent standard, echocardiographic measurement of radial shortening from the short axis provided recognition of discrete grades of regional dysfunction induced by transient reversible ischemia. This technique may be amenable for serial assessment of regional function after interventions on the ischemic myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of the centerline method to discern regional myocardial risk area was evaluated using two-dimensional echocardiographic measurements and coronary artery occlusion in 16 open chest, anesthetized dogs. The centerline method was modified to allow determination of both wall thickening and wall motion at control and during coronary artery occlusion. End-systolic and end-diastolic echocardiographic images were analyzed at 100 equally spaced points around the centerline of the short-axis view of the left ventricle to determine shortening and thickening abnormalities. In vivo risk regions were assessed by microsphere injection during occlusion, and autoradiographic analysis revealed a mean (+/- SD) circumferential risk area of 37.5 +/- 7.7%. Abnormal function was established by three criteria on the basis of the control values for both fractional shortening and wall thickening: 1) less than 2 SD, 2) less than 95% tolerance limits, and 3) dyskinesia. The criterion of less than 2 SD estimated a risk area of 45.9 +/- 16.7% for fractional shortening and 37.2 +/- 16.8% for wall thickening. Although neither value was significantly different from the actual mean value for the risk region, the results for fractional shortening were greater than for wall thickening (p less than 0.01). The less than 95% tolerance limit method significantly underestimated risk area for both shortening (25.6 +/- 15.1%, p less than 0.05) and thickening (19.1 +/- 12.7%, p less than 0.001), as did analysis by dyskinesia (13.1 +/- 12.1% for shortening, p less than 0.001; 20.6 +/- 12.1% for thickening, p less than 0.01). Thus, modification of the centerline method allowed determination of both fractional shortening and wall thickening from echocardiographic images.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cocaine potentiated shortening of sinus cycle length, AH interval and ventricular effective refractory period induced by norepinephrine infusion and shifted dose-response curves of these variables to the left in eight dogs (supersensitivity). Cocaine did not affect frequency-response curves of sinus cycle length and AH interval to ansae subclaviae stimulation. Ansae subclaviae stimulation shortened the ventricular effective refractory period more after cocaine injection, but frequency-response curves were not shifted to the left in seven dogs (no supersensitivity). Cocaine did not enhance electrical induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 15 dogs without acute myocardial infarction.

Recainam induced a concentration- and frequency-dependent decrease in the maximal rate of rise of the phase 0 of the action potential (Vmax), action potential amplitude and overshoot potential, with little or no change in the effective refractory period except in Purkinje fibers, in which it was markedly reduced. At a 300 microM concentration, Vmax was reduced 51% (p less than 0.001) in ventricular muscle and 44% (p less than 0.001) in atrial muscle, with no change in action potential duration or effective refractory period. At the same drug concentration in Purkinje fibers, Vmax was decreased by 41% (p less than 0.01), action potential duration at 90% repolarization by 36% (p less than 0.01) and effective refractory period by 34% (p less than 0.01). Recainam had no significant effect on the sinoatrial node, but it depressed phase 4 depolarization in isoproterenol-induced automaticity in Purkinje fibers. The drug had no effect on slow channel potentials induced by high concentrations of potassium and isoproterenol. The data indicate that the electrophysiologic profile of recainam in isolated cardiac muscle is consistent with the overall effects of class IC agents without having an effect on the slow calcium channel. Its major action is to depress Vmax, with little effect on refractoriness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They were also classified by severity: error of convenience (not critical with respect to diet) or error of compliance (contradictory to diet order). Error rates were determined and compared by meal, weekday vs. weekend, and first half of assembly period vs. second half. An average error rate of 12.9% was calculated from the 6,553 trays studied, with error rates of 12.5%, 10.9%, and 15.1% for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively. Evaluation of data revealed no significant difference in error rate as sorted by type of error, among meals, or between weekday and weekend. Only 2.7% of the trays had errors contradictory to the diet order. The error rate was significantly higher during the second half of the assembly period, and the highest error rates were observed for the evening meal. The methodology used in this study serves as the basis for quality control monitoring and as a motivational tool to stimulate improved performance by trayline employees.\r"

  ".W": "Median daily iron absorption was determined in iron-replete males and females between 2 and 19 years of age from the upper and lower socioeconomic strata of the Venezuelan population. A comparison was made with iron absorption of well-nourished children, on the basis of hematological and anthropometric reference values from the U.S. The median absorption level, which was calculated from the increase in total body iron due to growth and the daily losses through exfoliation and menstruation, was also used to estimate the requirements of 95% of the population. When the requirements were expressed in terms of body weight, no significant difference in iron absorption was observed between the three Venezuelan and one U.S. groups, ranging from about 30 to 38 micrograms/kg/day in both sexes between 4 and 16 years of age. However, when the requirements were expressed without division by the weight factor, the requirements of the better nourished groups were somewhat higher than those of the Venezuelan lower socioeconomic population with, in addition, a threefold variation over the 5 to 16 year age range. These findings suggest that the total iron requirements of children at a certain age may be most adequately expressed in terms of the optimal body weight for that age.\r"

The children with PKU were treated with a phenylalanine-free L-amino acid mix that supplied the following percentages (mean +/- standard deviation) of total daily intake: energy, 45 +/- 13; protein, 75 +/- 11; copper (Cu), 62 +/- 10; iron (Fe), 82 +/- 7; selenium (Se), 40 +/- 20; and zinc (Zn) 87 +/- 8. Diet records and blood samples were collected from each subject. Children with PKU had significantly greater mean intakes of Cu, Fe, and Zn than normal children. Mean serum Cu, Fe, and Zn concentrations of the children with PKU and normal children were not different despite significantly greater intakes by the children with PKU. Normal children had a significantly greater mean serum Se concentration and a mean blood chromium concentration 1.6 times that of children with PKU. Individuals whose primary source of protein is an elemental diet are especially at risk for multiple trace mineral deficiencies. Manufacturers of chemically defined medical foods should evaluate composition, specifically molar ratios between minerals, as a basis for product formulation.\r"

Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls were completed by parents of children aged 6 months and repeated at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years; children 10 years old served as their own respondents and were surveyed at ages 13, 15, and 17 years. The sample was 60% white and 40% black. Additional cohorts of 10-year-olds (no. = 686) were studied for temporal trend. Whites consumed significantly more caffeine than blacks as early as 1 year and persisted at a higher intake level from 2 to 17 years. This trend continued whether intake was measured in total milligrams, milligrams per 1,000 kcal, or milligrams per kilogram body weight. Significant sex differences in caffeine intakes per 1,000 kcal occurred among 15- and 17-year-olds (girls greater than boys). Peak periods of consumption occurred at ages 2, 3, 13, and 17. Snacks contributed large quantities of caffeine, particularly for 10-year-olds. Most frequent sources of caffeine were regular carbonated beverages, chocolate-containing foods, and tea. Mean intakes of caffeine for 10-year-olds were consistent from 1973 to 1982. Those observations document caffeine intakes beginning early in life.\r"

To examine food chloride distribution in nature, we focused on the uncooked, unadulterated, discrete, primitive foods in the data base (no. = 216 food items). The findings indicate the existence of both a large variability of chloride content among foods and a high degree of coupling of chloride with sodium. The contents of chloride and sodium varied over a similarly large range (coefficients of variation, 229% vs. 263%), differed very little from each other on the average (less than 20%), and correlated (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001) to the extent that greater than two-thirds of the overall variation of chloride content was linked to that of sodium content. Those findings accord with the often posited but untested assertion that the chloride content of foods approximates and parallels that of sodium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The conventional system, which involves the production of food close to time of service, has been the traditional method of hospital foodservice for centuries. The technology of the 1960s initiated the use of alternative systems, such as cook-chill and cook-freeze. Data from a survey of 807 hospital foodservice directors indicate that the conventional system remains the primary choice for hospital foodservice, although an increasing number of hospitals are converting to the cook-chill system. Choice of foodservice system appears to be dependent on the size of the hospital, city, and county but did not differ by region across the United States. In general, the smaller the hospital, city, and county, the more likely the use of the conventional system. As size increases, so does the occurrence of alternative systems, with cook-chill systems being the primary alternative chosen. Additional information is needed on the comparative costs and cash flows of the various foodservice systems.\r"

Corrective nutrition practices are critical for the endurance athlete to train, compete, and avoid injuries effectively. The best preventive measure may be the education of wrestlers, parents, and coaches about the consequences of rapid and extreme weight loss and the significant role nutrition plays in successful training and competition for the endurance athlete, fluid replacement being a key concern. For as long as wrestlers are required to compete in different weight categories, the popular practice of competing at the lowest possible weight will probably continue. The best course of action nutrition professionals can take is to become acutely aware of the unique nutritional concerns of these athletes in order to make this practice as safe as possible.\r"

A stratified sub-sample of subjects from the abstainers, infrequent, weekly, and daily drinkers was subsequently investigated in more detail. Men took alcohol more frequently than women and in greater quantities although frequency and amount decreased with age. The usual place for drinking was the home. The highest use of psychotropic drugs occurred in the abstainers, but this was significant for men only. When compared with drinking patterns in middle age, 60.1% of men and 30.3% of women said that they took less alcohol, while 7.4% of men and 11.1% of women said that they took more. The main reasons for decrease in alcohol intake were change in health and fewer social opportunities. The main reasons for increase in alcohol intake were more money and more time. Drinking was most commonly associated with social activities and few took alcohol to help cope with personal situations.\r"

The control group received no intervention. A year later, the experimental group reported 7.40 ambulatory encounters with a physician (SD = 4.94) and the control group reported 8.61 encounters (SD = 6.85). The difference between the groups, after adjusting for various prognostic factors, was 1.20 (95% confidence interval, -0.84 to 3.24). Although the difference did not achieve statistical significance, the results suggest that telephone support may bring about a substantial decrease in medical care utilization. Further research assessing the cost-advantage ratio for this type of intervention is recommended.\r"

Surveys of the U.S. population aged 65 years and over reveal a high frequency of such beliefs and activities, which are reported to play a significant role in their lives. In this study, the religious beliefs, activities, and motivations of 106 consecutive patients (mean age 74.4 years) attending a geriatric outpatient clinic were examined. A high prevalence of orthodox Christian beliefs, religious community activity, private devotional activity, and intrinsic religious orientation was found. Levels of religious activity and intrinsic orientation were lower among patients with cancer, chronic anxiety, depressive symptoms, and those who smoked cigarettes or consumed moderate to large amounts of alcohol. Intrinsic religiosity was lower among men with hypertension. Patients with mild to moderate dementia tended to have higher levels of intrinsic religious orientation. The results of this study suggest that religion is a powerful cultural force in the lives of older medical patients and is integrally related to both mental and physical health.\r"

X195 bound to NH2-terminal (C9a) fragments, and X197 bound to COOH-terminal (C9b) fragments obtained by cleavage of C9 with alpha-thrombin or trypsin. P40 recognized the epitope on the C9b fragment obtained by alpha-thrombin cleavage but did not react with the NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal fragment obtained by trypsin cleavage. In this respect, P40 differed from mAb to C9 reported previously. P40 almost completely inhibited the hemolytic activity of C9. X195 and X197 also inhibited C9 activity, but less effectively than P40. C9 molecules bound to P40 could not bind to EAC1-8 cells. C9 bound to X197 could not bind rapidly to EAC1-8, but prolonged incubation of the C9-X197 complex with EAC1-8 caused considerable lysis of the cells. C9 molecules bound to X195 could bind rapidly to EAC1-8, but their lytic activity was partially inhibited by the bound antibody. From these results, it is concluded that the C9b but not C9a domain contributes to the binding of C9 to EAC1-8 and that the epitope recognized by P40 or a closely adjacent site may be the binding site of C9 molecule to EAC1-8.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the migration of oil-induced, guinea pig peritoneal macrophages in three-dimensional fibrin matrices, with particular attention to variables which modified fibrin gel structure and/or its adhesive properties for cells. The variables studied were fibrin concentration, gel cross-linking, and fibronectin and glycosaminoglycan content. Macrophage migration was an inverse linear function of fibrinogen concentration. Little or no fibrinolysis accompanied macrophage migration; rather, macrophages migrated through fibrin gels by an active process associated with marked distortions of cell shape and specialized plasma membrane contacts with fibrin strands. Fibrin matrices prepared from fibrinogen that had been depleted of clotting factor XIII and/or fibronectin provided a superior matrix for macrophage migration. Both the number of migrating cells and distance of migration were reduced when the gel matrix included fibronectin and was cross-linked by factor XIII. A hexapeptide containing the fibronectin cell-binding RGDS sequence reversed this migration inhibition, suggesting that fibronectin immobilized by cross-linking to fibrin may have bound macrophages and restricted cell migration. Hyaluronic acid, heparin, and heparan sulfate inhibited macrophage migration in cross-linked fibrin-fibronectin gels over a range of concentrations. These data are relevant to an understanding of macrophage migration in vivo where cross-linked fibrin-fibronectin gels containing variable amounts of glycosaminoglycans are deposited in tissues in immunologic reactions and in many other types of pathology.\r"

Administration of Ag i.v. caused a marked increase in the peristaltic movement of the intestine, plasma exudation, and arteriolar constriction in the mesentery. The microvascular changes were accompanied by a profound fall in blood pressure, which was biphasic. The first phase lasted for approximately 2 min. The second phase was very prolonged and the hypotension was still maintained 40 min after Ag challenge. The changes observed were dose dependent with regard to Ag. Intradermal application of Ag resulted in dose-dependent extravasation of Evans blue dye in the skin. Plasma exudation was partially inhibited by pyrilamine and methysergide. However, their effect seemed to be more pronounced in the skin than in the mesentery. The leukotriene D4-R antagonist L-649,923 and the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor ONO-LP-049, alone or in combination with other inhibitors, did not alter the plasma leakage in the skin. In the mesentery, the leukotriene antagonists alone had a moderate effect on vascular permeability. However, the combination of these agents with pyrilamine completely inhibited macromolecular extravasation. The hypotension was modulated by the antihistamines as well as the leukotriene and serotonin antagonists. Pyrilamine inhibited the first phase and the second phase. The major effect of methysergide was a decrease in the duration of the hypotension. This was especially evident when it was administered in combination with other inhibitors. The leukotriene antagonists when given alone had moderate effects on the blood pressure changes. However, in combination with pyrilamine, the hypotension was substantially reduced. Leukotrienes appeared to be important mediators of the vascular changes in the mesentery but not in the skin (passive cutaneous anaphylaxis). They markedly potentiated the action of histamines.\r"

Monocytes and their in vitro transformed macrophages continued to elaborate these basophil histamine-releasing activities for at least 3 wk in culture. In the 18 basophil donors tested, maximum histamine release induced by monocyte supernatants was 33.8 +/- 5.9% (mean +/- SEM) of total basophil histamine content; optimum anti-IgE-induced release was 38.8 +/- 6.2%. Basophil histamine release in response to monocyte activities was optimal at 37 degrees C and at calcium concentrations of 2 to 5 mM. Release was greater than 90% complete 1 min after challenge and was inhibited by anti-allergic drugs. The mechanism of release appeared to be independent of IgE binding. Gel filtration of supernatants derived from both day 1 (monocyte stage) and day 14 (macrophage stage) cultures demonstrated activity peaks with approximate m.w. of 12,000 and 30,000. In contrast to the marked responsiveness of basophils, only 2 of 10 human lung mast cell preparations responded; release in those preparations was low: 3% and 13% histamine release, respectively. Thus, monocytes produce potent histamine-releasing activities with differential actions on basophils and mast cells.\r"

The C5a degradation product, C5a des Arg, is rapidly formed after exposure of C5a to serum carboxypeptidase N and may represent the relevant C5-derived inflammatory peptide in vivo. To examine the biologic activity of human C5a des Arg in vivo and to compare it with that seen with human C5a, we purified and characterized homogeneous preparations of human C5a and C5a des Arg and injected them intradermally into seven normal volunteers. C5a des Arg exhibited biochemical and biologic properties in vitro that were different from those of C5a. When injected into human skin, C5a des Arg was less potent than C5a, in respect to both minimal dose eliciting wheal and flare reactions and maximal wheal and flare elicited at a given dose, but C5a des Arg still elicited cutaneous wheal and flare reactions at physiologically relevant concentrations. Histologically, C5a des Arg skin test sites showed dense polymorphonuclear neutrophil-rich infiltrates associated with leukocytoclasis, dermal mast cell degranulation, and endothelial cell swelling. These were virtually indistinguishable from reactions elicited by C5a and occurred with concentrations attainable in vivo. Cutaneous wheal and flare reactions elicited by either C5a or C5a des Arg were partially inhibited by H1 antihistamines but were unaffected by selected nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.\r"

Two mAb produced against promastigote membranes (P-9 and P-10) were found to be specific against this stage. Antibodies P-1 through P-8 on analysis by radioimmune binding only reacted with determinants present on amastigotes. mAb P-2, P-4, and P-8 also reacted with Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes but not promastigotes. No cross-reactions were found on any other species of Leishmania or with membranes of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes or amastigotes. An indirect immunofluorescence assay using mAb P-1 through P-8 confirmed the stage specificity and binding to L. pifanoi axenically grown amastigotes, amastigotes within infected hamster tissue, and amastigotes within J774.1 macrophages. When Western blot analysis of amastigote membranes was conducted, one distinct group of molecules associated with L. pifanoi-specific determinants was identified. mAb P-1, P-3, P-5, P-7, and P-8 bound to molecules Mr 43 and 34 kDa. Promastigote-specific mAb P-9 recognized a diffuse pattern from 88 to greater than 200 kDa, and mAb P-10 localized a second class of proteins with Mr53 kDa. On immunoprecipitation of solubilized [35S]methionine-labeled amastigotes, mAb P-2 recognized a doublet of Mr 35 and 33 kDa and another doublet at Mr 17.5 and 13.5 kDa. mAb P-4 and P-7 each precipitated a band at Mr 34 kDa. These studies indicate that antigenically the axenically cultured amastigote is closely related to macrophage-derived amastigote. These mAb and/or purified protein Ag may be useful in studying stage differentiation, monitoring transformation, and for further taxonomic, epidemiologic, and immunologic studies of New World leishmaniasis.\r"

  ".U": "88170832\r", 
  ".W": "The nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequence of a DRw10 beta chain was obtained from cDNA clones isolated from a DR1, DRw10 heterozygous cell line. The sequence of this beta chain gene was distinctive, differing from those of all other defined DR types. The DRw10 beta chain gene was shown by transfection experiments to encode a polymorphic epitope recognized by mAb 109d6 that is also encoded by the DRw53 beta 2 chain gene. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of both genes revealed that their third D regions (amino acids 67 to 73) were identical. This suggested first that the 109d6 epitope could be encoded by residues of this region, and second, that a putative gene conversion event transferred this sequence along with the information encoding the 109d6 epitope from a donor gene such as DRw53 beta 2. The sequence of the DRw10 beta chain gene was observed to be identical to that of clone pII beta 4 derived from the non-DR3 haplotype in the Raji cell line, which was also demonstrated to express the determinant recognized by antibody 109d6, suggesting that the typing of this cell line is HLA-DR3/DRw10. No evidence was found for the existence of a DR beta 2 chain gene product encoded by the DRw10 haplotype. The DRw10 haplotype was of particular interest because it was present along with a DR1 haplotype in the propositus who had rheumatoid arthritis, and was shared by the DR4-positive son of the propositus, who also had rheumatoid arthritis. This raised the possibility that the DRw10 haplotype, and most probably one or more specific conformations encoded by the DR beta chain, are involved in the definition of the disease susceptibility phenotype.\r"

A three- to fourfold increase in collagen synthesis was associated with a two- to threefold increase in the levels of mRNAs for both type I and type III procollagens.

To further evaluate the relationships between granuloma formation and T-cell function, we treated euthymic BALB/c mice with cyclosporine (Cs), a potent immunosuppressive drug, injected intramuscularly (150 mg/kg/day) 5 times a week. Hepatic granulomas were isolated from mice with schistosomiasis and transplanted into the skin of mice treated with Cs for 2 weeks. Cyclosporine injection was continued for 3 additional weeks. Blood levels of the drug increased during treatment (489 ng/ml at 2 weeks and 822 ng/ml at 5 weeks). Morphologically identical granulomas developed in both treated and untreated mice. Examination for T-cell functions showed that by the end of 2 weeks treatment, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin responses, and IL-2 activity were markedly depressed, and IL-2 receptor expression was not detected in either lymph nodes or spleen of the Cs-treated mice; however, after hepatic granuloma graft, T-cell functions in regional lymph nodes, but not in spleen, as well as peripheral blood eosinophilia were stimulated in Cs-treated mice. These data strongly suggest that intact T-cell activity is not essential for the initiation of granuloma formation. In addition, granuloma grafts appear to stimulate Cs-resistant T-cell activation locally, which amplifies and organizes the granulomatous response.\r"

During the organization and maturation of these cysts, fibronectin accumulates in the surrounding extracellular matrix and the basement membrane proteins bullous pemphigoid antigen and laminin appear at the epithelial-stromal interface. The sequence in which these proteins appear parallels that seen during reepithelialization of a skin wound in vivo. Fibronectin appears during aggregation of the epidermal cells and persists in the area surrounding the cysts for at least 7 days. Bullous pemphigoid antigen and laminin appear later (by 4 and 7 days, respectively) and ultimately become organized into a continuous band at the periphery of the cyst. This distribution of bullous pemphigoid antigen and laminin at the stromal-epithelial interface persists at least 5 weeks, suggesting that the implanted epidermal cells are capable of developing and maintaining a stable basement membrane zone. Fibronectin, which is abundant in the matrix adjacent to the epidermal cysts and in the surrounding stroma during cyst organization and maturation, diminishes to undetectable levels by 5 weeks. While much of the fibronectin derives from the host tissues, species-specific antibodies to human fibronectin reveal that at least a portion of this protein is synthesized and deposited by the implanted epidermal cells.\r"

As an alternative to the colony formation assay, this method can be used for the rapid diagnosis of ultraviolet light sensitivity in fibroblasts from photosensitive disorders. The method is based on growth of small numbers of cells in 1-cm wells of culture trays for 4 or more days after irradiation and determination of cell survival by the incorporation of [3H]hypoxanthine. D37 values (the dose at which 37% of the control level of incorporation remains) obtained from this procedure showed the same relative sensitivity of normal and xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts as was obtained by colony formation. Untransformed and SV40-transformed fibroblasts, which have different growth rates and different responses to high cell densities, gave different D37 values by this assay in culture trays as compared with colony formation. Comparison of relative sensitivities to irradiation should therefore be made only between cell types with similar growth characteristics. The similar sensitivity of normal and xeroderma pigmentosum cells to mitomycin C was also determined by this culture tray method. By increasing cell density at the beginning of the experiments, a greater capacity of group C compared with group D fibroblasts for recovery from potentially lethal damage was also detected.\r"

Both cell types display two forms of the enzyme, one of which is cytosoluble (TGc) and the other which is associated with the plasma membrane (TGm). Normal keratinocytes contain predominantly TGm, and SV-K14 cells mainly TGc. The ratio of TGm to TGc can be modulated by the culture conditions and correlates with the competence of the cells to form a cornified envelope. TGm and TGc differ in their biochemical and immunological properties. SDS electrophoresis reveals apparent molecular weights of 92 and 85 kD, respectively. Only the activity of TGc is inhibited in the presence of guanosine 5'-triphosphate. Their response to Ca2+ is different: TGc exhibits a sigmoidal activation kinetics with an A50 value of about 200 microM, whereas the kinetics for TGm is hyperbolic with an A50 value of 75 microM. TGm reacts with a monoclonal antibody raised against epidermal \"particulate\" transglutaminase, and TGc with a polyclonal antibody raised against guinea pig liver transglutaminase. These reactions are very specific and no cross-reaction occurs. The coappearance of TGm with a proteolytic fragment (Mr 82,000) in the cytosol and intracellular particulate fraction of normal human keratinocytes is probably a preparation artifact.\r"

  ".W": "The ontogeny and composition of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) in developing human embryonic and fetal skin was studied at progressive stages of gestation by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunocytochemistry using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The DEJ of embryonic skin at 5 weeks estimated gestational age (EGA) was a simple basement membrane zone limited to the basal cell plasma membrane, lamina lucida, and lamina densa. A network of reticular collagen fibrils (reticular lamina) was deposited beneath the lamina densa by 6 weeks. Coincident with the onset of increased complexity in epidermal and dermal structure, at the time of the embryonic to fetal transition, the DEJ displayed additional components that were markers of maturation. At 7-8 weeks EGA, fine filamentous structures extended from the DEJ into the reticular lamina. By 9 weeks EGA hemidesmosomes and banded anchoring fibrils were recognizable, although distributed sparsely at the DEJ. With increasing gestational age, these structures displayed greater electron density and structural completeness. By the end of the first trimester, the DEJ appeared ultrastructurally similar to that of mature skin. Weak immunofluorescent labeling demonstrated the presence of type VII collagen at the DEJ by 8 weeks EGA. From 10-12 weeks EGA immunofluorescent labeling of the DEJ for type VII collagen was distinctly punctate, while immunoperoxidase labeling observed by TEM was linear, continuous, and sublamina densa in position. With ongoing gestation the immunofluorescent labeling became increasingly stronger at the DEJ. Thus, type VII collagen was present at the DEJ in the zone immediately beneath the lamina densa, before the appearance of mature anchoring fibrils but coordinate with the appearance of fine filamentous, unbanded structures, and appeared to increase with the development and accumulation of anchoring fibrils.\r"

  ".W": "Hairless mouse skin currently provides a popular model membrane for studies in human percutaneous absorption. Although some similarities between the two skin types have been demonstrated, the effects of prolonged hydration on hairless mouse skin have not previously been rigorously examined. We have measured in vitro the effects of hydration at 31 degrees C on the permeabilities of hairless mouse skin and human abdominal and scalp skin to a model polar compound (water) and a lipid material (hexanol). The permeability of hairless mouse skin rose dramatically, especially to water (fiftyfold increase), whereas the human skin was more stable. We also compared the effects of stripping the stratum corneum with the effects of 8-d hydration for hairless mouse and human abdominal skin. Hydration of hairless mouse skin was as effective as tape-stripping in eliminating the stratum corneum barrier, whereas stripping human skin was far more damaging than hydration, suggesting that prolonged hydration mechanically disrupted mouse skin but not human skin. Histological examination of fresh and hydrated tissues confirmed this suggestion. We therefore recommend that hairless mouse skin is not used as a model for human tissue during in vitro permeation studies under conditions of long-term hydration, i.e., greater than three days.\r"

This paper describes an enzymatic alternative. Epidermal homogenates from hairless mice were found to catalyze the formation of PCA from both glutamine and glutamic acid at pH 6.2. Enzyme activity responsible for the first step in this reaction, gamma-glutamyl peptide formation, was partially purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange, gel filtration, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. Enzyme preparations free of gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase activity (which forms PCA from certain gamma-glutamyl peptides) catalyzed formation of gamma-glutamyl-glutamine from glutamine and gamma-glutamyl-glutamate from glutamic acid. Enzyme preparations catalyzed hydrolysis of a variety of gamma-glutamyl peptides but did not split non-gamma-glutamyl peptides or the transpeptidase substrate gamma-glutamyl-rho-nitroanilide. Ammonium sulfate fractions containing both gamma-glutamyl peptidase and gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase activity catalyzed linear formation of PCA from glutamic acid for periods of up to 19 h. Using gamma-glutamyl-leucine as a substrate, gamma-glutamyl peptidase activity was found to be much higher in crude extracts from epidermis than in preparations from liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, lung, brain, or heart. This activity has not, to our knowledge, been previously described in mammalian tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Human psoriatic scale extracts produced kinins from heated plasma (11.3 +/- 5.5 ng kinin/mg protein) and from purified low molecular weight (LMW) bovine kininogen (4.4 +/- 1.7 ng/mg). Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration of the extracts showed three peaks of kininogenase activity with Mr values of 90,000 (K-I), 65,000 (K-II), and 35,000 (K-III). Upon DEAE-Sepharose chromatography of the Sephacryl peaks, K-I activity was found in the nonadsorbed fraction and formed kinins only from heated plasma. Peak K-II activity was resolved into two peaks, K-IIa (in the nonadsorbed fraction), which formed kinins only from heated plasma, and K-IIb (in the adsorbed fraction), which formed kinins from both heated plasma and LMW bovine kininogen. K-III kininogenase activity appeared at the same position as K-IIb and also formed kinins from both substrates. Kininogenases K-I and K-IIa had the same Km value (0.3 mM) with Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide(pNA), similar to that found with human plasma kallikrein. The Km value of K-IIb with Val-Leu-Arg-pNA (0.8 mM) was like that found for human salivary kallikrein, whereas K-III had a low affinity for this substrate. Like plasma kallikrein, K-I and K-IIa were inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor, but only weakly by aprotinin. In addition the kininogenase activity of both K-I and K-IIa was neutralized by adding antihuman prekallikrein immunoglobulin G (IgG). In contrast, K-IIb and K-III were strongly inhibited by aprotinin but not by soybean trypsin inhibitor, consistent with their being tissue kallikreins. It was confirmed that K-IIb and K-III shares antigenic determinant of urinary kallikrein.\r"

We questioned whether increased kinase activation could account for this observation. In these studies, we measured abnormally lower basal calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PK-C) phosphorylation in MNL from patients with AD. Basal cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK-A) phosphorylation was concomitantly higher in MNL from patients with AD. These results are in agreement with earlier reports that PK-A activity may have a negative influence on PK-C activity in certain cell systems. Stimulation with the H1-histamine agonist, thiazolylethylamine (TEA), of MNL from normal donors but not patients with AD, resulted in statistically significant increases in PK-C phosphorylation. This implies receptor down regulation or functional desensitization in AD cells. Altered basal protein kinase phosphorylation and abnormal response to selective histamine agonists seen in MNL from patients with AD could explain elevated PDE activity.\r"

All men were treated with 49 g per week of either Betamethasone Diproprionate in an optimized vehicle or Clobetasol Proprionate ointment. Three methods used to assess HPAS were compared. Classic 8 a.m. plasma cortisol measurements, urinary-free cortisol, and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid determinations and gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GCMS) quantitation of urinary cortisol metabolites were compared. Values for all methods were obtained just prior to therapy and at days 4, 7, 14, and 21 during therapy and at day 28 after treatment was stopped for 7 d. Plasma cortisol measurements correlated well with other measures of HPAS. GCMS determination of urinary cortisol metabolites was slightly more sensitive at detecting HPAS than the other two methods. Persistent HPAS after day 7 was only appreciated by GCMS. Urinary-free cortisol and 17-hydroxycortisol was the least sensitive of the three methods. Analysis of urinary cortisol metabolites by GCMS may be most useful in the monitoring of HPAS resulting from use of topical glucocorticosteroid preparations.\r"

  ".W": "To better define the relationship between membrane depolarization and extracellular Ca2+ influx during neutrophil activation, we compared stimulation by elevating the extracellular K+ concentration, [K+]o, with stimulation by the chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Elevation of [K+]o resulted in uniform depolarization of the entire population of cells. This was associated with an influx of Ca2+ that was temporally delayed and quantitatively less than that induced by fMLP. K+ depolarization also caused increased expression of type 1 (C3b/C4b) complement receptor (CR1) and type 3 (C3bi) complement receptor (CR3), but the increments were less than with fMLP. We then used pertussis toxin to determine if guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins were involved in these responses. Toxin inhibited the fMLP-induced membrane depolarization as well as the uptake of extracellular Ca2+ and the expression of both CR1 and CR3 induced by the chemoattractant. This indicates that the fMLP receptor is not directly coupled to an ion channel. The membrane depolarization induced by elevating [K+]o was not inhibited by toxin, but the uptake of Ca2+ and the increased expression of CR1 and CR3 were all significantly inhibited. The toxin failed to block increased CR1 and CR3 expression induced by ionomycin, demonstrating that its effects were not attributable to general toxicity. The results suggest that voltage gating is not the major mechanism by which polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) increase their permeability to extracellular Ca2+. Initial signals, whether generated by chemoattractants binding to their receptors or by small initial influxes of extracellular Ca2+, must be amplified by pertussis toxin-sensitive steps to fully increase the Ca2+ permeability and optimally activate the cell.\r"

  ".W": "Beta-blockade has been reported to have beneficial hemodynamic effects in chronic congestive heart failure that may be related to alterations in the abnormal neurohumoral profile characteristic of this population. To determine the relationship of the neurohumoral profile to the hemodynamic response to beta-blockade in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, neurohumoral and hemodynamic variables were measured in 10 subjects having congestive cardiomyopathy at baseline and after administration of the beta-blocker pindolol. Baseline stroke index was noted to have an inverse curvilinear relation with plasma norepinephrine (r = -0.69) and renin (r = -0.71) concentration. Pulmonary vascular resistance demonstrated a direct logarithmic relation with plasma norepinephrine concentration (r = 0.68). Increases in norepinephrine, dopamine, and epinephrine concentrations after dosing were noted, with the most marked increase in norepinephrine concentration being coincident with a significant decline in stroke volume index. Two patients not tolerating beta-blockade were characterized by having baseline norepinephrine concentrations 3 SD higher than those of the remaining patients, more marked increases in epinephrine concentration after dosing, and the most profoundly decompensated heart failure at baseline, as defined by the relationship between neurohumoral and hemodynamic variables. These observations suggest that increases in catecholamines after dosing reflect a compensatory response to the adverse hemodynamic-inotropic effects of beta-blockade in congestive heart failure. The neurohumoral profile and the relationship of neuroendocrine to hemodynamic parameters may be useful in delineating patients at risk for adverse hemodynamic effects of beta-blockade.\r"

These effects were systematically investigated in 10 patients with normal intraventricular conduction. The His-Purkinje system relative refractory period (HPS-RRP) of the postextrasystolic beat and that of a comparable constant cycle length ventricular drive were measured by the ventricular extrastimulus technique. Results were as follows: the HPS-RRP of the postextrasystolic beat after one premature beat was longer than the HPS-RRP during a comparable constant ventricular drive. However, with the addition of each successive premature beat, the HPS-RRP of the postextrasystolic beat alternated between lower and higher values, in a manner dependent on whether there was an odd or even number of premature beats. In contrast, ventricular refractoriness of the postextrasystolic beats behaved in a cumulative manner, decreasing progressively with the addition of each premature beat.\r"

After 30 days of incubation with conduritol-B-epoxide, the macrophages contained almost 10 times as much glucocerebroside as the untreated controls, and the cells displayed morphologic changes reminiscent of Gaucher's cells.

In six rabbits 14C-dextran was compared with dextran blue during a 4-hour \"dwell\" with a 4.25% dextrose solution. The recovery of 14C-dextran at the end of the dwell was 71% +/- 3% vs. 92% +/- 1% for dextran blue (P less than 0.001). In six other rabbits, radioactive albumin (RISA) was compared with dextran blue. The recovery of RISA was 78% +/- 4%, compared with 85% +/- 2% for dextran blue (P less than 0.05). The calculated peritoneal volumes, uncorrected for disappearance of the markers, were consistently higher than when correction was made. After correction, the calculated end volumes were similar to actually measured end volumes. In six patients with chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, the intraperitoneal volume during a single dwell of 6 hours was estimated in paired observations with lactated Ringer's solution and 1.5% dextrose dialysate, using simultaneously autologous hemoglobin and RISA. In eight additional patients, a single dwell with 4.25% dextrose dialysate was studied. The recoveries of both markers were related to the osmotic strength of the dialysate. Recoveries were 66.7% +/- 2.3% and 69.6% +/- 0.9% in lactated Ringer's solution, and increased to 81% +/- 3% and 82% +/- 2% in 4.25% dextrose for hemoglobin and RISA, respectively. With each dialysate, after correction for disappearance of the marker, no differences in volume profiles or between calculated or measured end volumes could be found with either hemoglobin or RISA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Conflicting data exist on the role of neutrophils (PMNs) in the pathogenesis of hyperoxic lung damage. We examined the contribution of PMNs and the contribution of food deprivation, a frequent complication of the methods used to produced neutropenia, to the lung damage that results when mice are exposed to high concentrations of oxygen. Mice were exposed to either 100% oxygen or air for up to 4 days. Neutropenia was induced by a single tail vein injection of nitrogen mustard (NM) given 1 day before the oxygen exposure. Food deprivation, which induced the same weight loss as that found in NM-treated mice, was achieved by withholding food (fasted) during the oxygen exposure. We examined mortality; weight loss; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL fluid) protein concentration, cell count, and differential count; the number of PMNs in blood; and lung histologic conditions by light and electron microscopy. NM-treated mice lost approximately 25% of their body weight when exposed to either air or oxygen. They also had more severe lung damage than the saline-treated mice during hyperoxic exposure, despite a marked reduction in the number of PMNs in blood, BAL fluid, and lung tissue. Although a correlation was found between the number of blood PMNs and the BAL protein concentration in the nonneutropenic mice (r = 0.69; P less than 0.001), no correlation was seen in the neutropenic mice (r = 0.26). Fasted, oxygen-exposed mice had the same weight loss as the NM mice, but they had more severe lung damage at an earlier time (day 3 vs. day 4) and greater mortality than the saline-treated and the NM-treated mice. These results indicate that PMNs are not required for either the development or progression of hyperoxic lung damage in mice; fasting increases susceptibility to the lung damage; and differences in nutritional status may explain, in part, the controversial role of PMNs in oxygen-induced lung damage.\r"

Serum from a worker with trimellitic anhydride (TMA) asthma that contained high titers of IgE, IgG, IgM, and IgA to trimellityl-human serum albumin (TM-HSA) was aerosolized into the lungs of two monkeys to afford passive airway sensitization. After the monkeys were challenged with aerosolized TM-HSA, pulmonary functions demonstrated acute airway responses similar to that of Ascaris antigen-induced, IgE-mediated bronchospasm in Ascaris-sensitive monkeys. The monkeys had no airway reactivity when challenged with TM-HSA 1 week after the first positive TM-HSA response elicited with passive sensitization. Passive cutaneous reactivity to TM-HSA was also elicited by the donor serum, but heat-treated donor serum failed to confer cutaneous or bronchial reactivity. These results indicate that airway reactivity in this passive-transfer monkey model of TMA asthma is an antigen-specific response mediated by heat-labile serum factors, presumably IgE to TM-HSA, and does not occur by irritant mechanisms. This experimental model could become a valuable system for evaluating the role of IgE to hapten-protein conjugates in the immunopathogenesis of asthma caused by other reactive chemicals capable of acting as haptens. We postulate that immunologic and clinical features should be consistent with asthma caused by such reactive chemicals and mediated by such mechanisms.\r"

(Br J Haematol 1985; 61:315-22) reported that men at high risk for cardiovascular disease had an increased mean level of factor VII procoagulant activity that was apparently attributable to an increase of a phospholipase C-sensitive form of factor VII in their plasma. We chose to investigate this phenomenon further by observing patients at high risk of coronary artery disease with assays that reflect the activity state of factor VII. We measured factor VII levels in patients before coronary arteriography and in normal subjects by an amidolytic assay (FVIIam assay) and by a standard clotting assay (FVIIc-A assay), both of which reflect the total amount of factor VII and are insensitive to activated factor VII, and by the method of Seligson et al. (Blood 1978;52:978-88) (FVIIc-B assay), which is sensitive to the presence of activated factor VII. In the FVIIc-A and FVIIam assays, the patients had a significantly higher mean value than the normal subjects; in the FVIIc-B assay, the patients had a significantly lower mean value than did the normal subjects. Moreover, the ratio of FVIIc-B to FVIIam, which is an indicator of the factor VII activity state, was much lower for the patients (0.70) than for the normal subjects (0.99). Thus, patients at high risk for coronary artery disease have an increased mean level of total factor VII that is not associated with an increase in activated factor VII and therefore presumably reflects an increase in zymogen factor VII.\r"

The sequence of development of these alterations has been examined by X-ray of 1965 cadavers of 15 years of age or over and correlated with the gross bone and cartilage morphology changes in many cases. This technique allows for age determination within 5 years of real age in 55% of cadavers and within 25% of real age in 95% of all cadavers. The greatest departures from real age are in the over-60-year groups. The same roentgenograms can allow for correct sex prediction in 99% of the population.\r"

The correction factor suggested by this study is 0.16(age--45), subtracted from the maximum height. The loss is also affected by the maximum height of the individual. In cases of low bone mineralization, the increased incidence of vertebral crush fractures may cause further reductions in standing height. The low rate of recognition of height changes among the older community lowers the usefulness of the age adjusted height estimate. It is recommended that both the maximum and age adjusted heights be provided in forensic science reports to aid in matching with missing person reports.\r"

Postmortem human rib samples were surface sterilized and incubated under sterile conditions in either high or low humidity conditions at room temperature for a period of weeks. At selected times, portions of the bone were cut away, and the DNA from these samples was extracted and subjected to strand separating gel electrophoresis. The DNAs in the gels were transferred to a nylon membrane, preserving their relative positions as in the gel, and probed with radioactive total genomic human DNA. Autoradiograms produced were scanned and digitized. When the samples were incubated under identical conditions, the degradation rate of DNA in samples from different individuals appeared very similar. The DNA degradation rate may vary with temperature and humidity more than it varies between individuals.\r"

He also administered two body-image questionnaires, each to half of the sample population. Those who used a name variation, however defined, were found to have increased head awareness and decreased stomach awareness when compared with those who had not used a name variation. Otherwise, these groups had no statistically significant differences among a wide group of descriptive variables. The author suggests that the differences in body image may be associated with cognitive differences in the ways in which these subjects approach themselves and their environments.\r"

The latter three are measured by rating scales completed by both patients and staff. Although statistical analysis of recidivism is in progress, it may not reflect the true frequency of reoffenses.

A suicidal .410-caliber shotgun injury of the right eye is described in which typical petal abrasions were noted around the entrance wound. However, significant soot deposition around the wound suggested that the range of fire was less than 30 cm and perhaps closer to 15 cm. Test-firing of the weapon and ammunition used by the decedent showed some spread of the shotcup petals at a range of 7.5 cm, progressing to maximum spread at 30 to 52.5 cm. Further testing with other .410 ammunition, containing shotcups, confirmed the spread of shotcup petals at ranges less than 30 cm, irrespective of manufacturer, shotshell length, and birdshot size. When a variety of shotguns were tested, it was found that one weapon with a very short barrel and cylinder bore did not exhibit petal spread until a range of 30 cm was reached. The remaining shotguns, with longer barrels and full choke, all demonstrated definite petal spread at a range of 12.5 cm. The long, narrow configuration of .410 shotcup petals may explain their early spread and the production of petal abrasions at ranges of less than 30 cm.\r"

Although radiographic examination is helpful in bullet localization, the characteristic central post may be identified by X-ray only if sufficient expansion results in its exposure. Three cases of shooting deaths involving Hydra-Shok bullets are presented and discussed; in each case, the entrance wounds were indistinguishable from entrances associated with conventional ammunition, and in no instance did the missiles exit from the body (including head, chest, and abdominal wounds). Familiarity with relatively unusual ammunition types such as the Hydra-Shok allows for quick identification by the pathologist at the time of autopsy.\r"

The approximate 95% reference range for zinc in precoital vaginal fluid was 1.2 to 15 micrograms/mL (mean 4.5), and in postcoital vaginal fluid 4.0 to 135 micrograms/mL (mean 24). There is an overlap between the precoital and postcoital reference ranges.

The leading method in use today is particularly ineffective in its placement of American Indian skulls from the western regions of the United States. Recent development and testing of a new metric method suggests a much more effective technique. The method involves six breadth and projection measurements of the midfacial skeleton, the calculation of three indices, and a simple direct reading of results. The method has the additional advantage of use in the autopsy room with minimal dissection of soft tissue required. Based upon a less extensive test of East Asian and Arctic Mongoloid crania, the method appears to be even more effective in separating them from the sharp featured whites. Larger samples of American blacks and Polynesians are presently under study and these also appear to separate quite readily from whites using the same or similar sectioning values.\r"

By computed axial tomography (CAT), ventricle-brain ratio (VBR) and cortical atrophy were assessed. The relation between the clinical variables and CAT findings was assessed using linear correlation. CAT-based subgroups were compared using univariate analysis of variance. Previous findings of ventricular enlargement and cortical atrophy in some schizophrenics were replicated. Premorbid asociality and social deterioration were found to have a modest, positive relation with CAT findings but formal thought disorder had a negative relation to ventricle size. There was no relation between the negative symptoms and CAT measures. Within the CAT-positive group the presence of cortical atrophy appeared to be associated with a more severe illness compared with those with ventricular enlargement but the sample sizes were too small to obtain any significant differences.\r"

The schizophrenic patients as a group showed significantly poorer performance on the WAIS (full scale: X +/- SD, 92.9 +/- 2.9 vs. 110.8 +/- 2.1, p less than .002) and the Halstead-Reitan Battery (HRB; Average Impairment Range = 2.1 +/- .2 vs. 1.12 +/- .06, p less than .003). In addition the schizophrenic patients did significantly worse than did nonschizophrenic patients on all WAIS subtests and scored in the impaired range on most HRB subtests. Computed axial tomography scans revealed large ventricles on nine schizophrenic patients and cortical atrophy on three others. Among schizophrenics, the enlarged ventricle group consistently scored the worst. No relationship was seen between neuropsychological test performance and degree of ongoing psychopathology as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. These findings are consistent with previous reports of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and are discussed in terms of regional localization. They provide additional evidence that the impairment is related to the disease process and that structural abnormalities are associated with the more severe condition.\r"

Community adjustment was operationalized to include measures of instrumental performance, social participation, and satisfaction with community circumstances. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to assess the contribution of social- and community-level predictors. The results of the study suggest that the character of a psychiatric patient's social milieu can influence the success he or she experiences in attempting to adjust to life in the community. Specifically, each of the measures of adjustment was closely related to significant other attitudes, i.e., expectations and tolerance of deviance. The nature of the community in which the patient resides seems to have less of an impact on community adjustment than social-level factors. Overall, the results suggest the importance of a social-environmental strategy as a means of achieving positive changes in patients' adjustment to community living.\r"

Patients experienced a greater sense of being helped when the emotional climate of the program was highly evaluated, when the staff had been clear about the program goals and expectations, and when personal problems were not scrutinized. Staff felt that the most important program ingredients were the actual treatment elements dealing with personal and practical problems.

These findings indicate that the different clinical syndromes caused by cortical auditory lesions form a spectrum of related auditory processing disorders. Differences between syndromes may depend on the degree of involvement of a primary cortical processing system, the more diffuse accessory system, and possibly the efferent auditory system.\r"

Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) thus elicited in the orbicularis oris muscle of controls were of similar amplitude but longer latency (1.3 SD 0.15 ms) compared with CMAPs produced by conventional electrical stimulation at the stylomastoid foramen. No response to magnetic stimulation could be recorded from the affected side in 15 of 16 patients with Bell's palsy. Serial studies in two patients demonstrated that the facial nerve remained inexcitable by magnetic stimulation despite marked improvement in clinical function. In the patient with a pontine glioma, the CMAP elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation was of low amplitude but normal latency. In six of seven patients with demyelinating neuropathy, the response to intracranial magnetic stimulation was significantly delayed. Magnetic stimulation produced no response in either patient with traumatic facial palsy. Although the precise site of facial nerve stimulation is uncertain, evidence points to the labyrinthine segment of the facial canal as the most likely location.\r"

In 16 patients the diagnosis could be confirmed serologically by means of ELISA techniques. In gnathostomiasis encephalitis, myelitis, radiculitis and subarachnoid haemorrhage formed the majority of clinical syndromes. Intracerebral haematoma and transitory obstructive hydrocephalus are described in this report as being caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum infection for the first time. In angiostronglyus infections the clinical syndrome of meningitis was predominant, but one patient, whose angiostrongyliasis was proved serologically, also showed bilateral paresis of abducens nerve. The main laboratory finding was eosinophilic pleocytosis in the CSF (greater than 10%) which in patients originating or returning from South-East-Asia, particularly Thailand, is highly suggestive of these parasitic infections. Increasing transcontinental travel, influx of refugees and those seeking asylum as well as importation of food from South East Asian countries demand greater awareness of these parasitic infections even in Central Europe.\r"

MAP was reduced by the infusion of sodium nitroprusside. In the normal animals with administration of sodium nitroprusside, CBF increased initially but started to decrease as MAP was reduced below 65 mm Hg and fell below its baseline value when MAP was less than 50 mm Hg. In the SAH group, there was no initial hyperaemic response and CBF fell below baseline values when MAP was reduced below 50 mm Hg. When, during the infusion of the sodium nitroprusside, MAP was returned to normal using angiotensin, CBF increased above its baseline value. These results suggest that the cerebrovascular effects of sodium nitroprusside are the net result of competition between direct cerebral vasodilatation, falling arterial blood pressure and the degree of impairment of the \"autoregulatory\" mechanism. Evidence of ischaemic brain damage was found in the arterial boundary zones of both groups of animals.\r"

Cortical rCBF was not reduced in Huntington's disease patients even while they manifested overt prefrontal-type cognitive deficits. Caudate atrophy on CT and rCBF were significantly correlated, but only during the prefrontal behaviour where the correlation was positive. These results suggest a qualification of the subcortical dementia concept as applied to Huntington's disease and implicate an interaction between pathology that is subcortical and cognitive function that is cortical.\r"

In addition, there is scattered epidemiologic evidence and considerable clinical support that disturbed or inadequate sleep may be a risk factor for clinical emergence of cardiovascular disease and for total mortality. The role of sleep problems both as a precursor and as a sequela of disease states could be better delineated in large groups by the availability of a brief, reliable and standardized scale for sleep disturbance. Such a scale could also be used to evaluate the impact of different therapies upon sleep problems. This paper presents data from two study populations responding to three and four item self-report scales. From 9 to 12% of air traffic controllers reported various sleep problems to have occurred on half or more of the days during the prior month, whereas 12-22% of patients 6 months after cardiac surgery reported such frequent sleep problems. Utilizing data from the 6 and 12 month follow-ups, test-retest reliability of the three-item scale in cardiac surgery patients was found to be 0.59. Internal consistency coefficients for the three and four-item scales were 0.63 and 0.79 respectively.\r"

This question has been addressed using a telephone interview of families of 483 children followed in one of three clinics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia: the Neonatal Follow-up Program, the Pediatric Rheumatology Center and the Spina Bifida Program. Limitations in activities of daily living due to the health of the child, medical care use and variables indicative of socio-economic disadvantage were associated with a maternal rating of child health as fair/poor in all groups. The relationship was strongest in the rheumatologic group and less strong in the other two, suggesting that mothers may distinguish between a chronic active disease in a previously healthy child and the disability following a neonatal event in conceptualizing health. The results add to our information about maternal perceptions in assessing child health and suggest ways in which such ratings may prove useful in assessing health and health services for children with health problems.\r"

In this method the sum of squares of regression (SSR) for pairs of variables are partitioned into orthogonal and shared components. A shared component is the reduction in the SSR of one of the variables when the other variable is added to the regression equation. This method shows how the SSR for one variable depends on the other variables present in the regression equation and explains apparent inconsistencies between forward and backward stepwise regression. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of this method we reanalyzed previously reported data on the relationship between coronary heart disease (CHD) and diet. The analysis suggested that carbohydrate and alcohol intake are negatively associated with CHD because they are associated with greater caloric intake. Protein and fat intake are also associated with greater caloric intake, but in addition they are associated with factors that increase the risk of CHD.\r"

On the basis of this hypothesis, a model has been postulated and applied to the data for the 94 Italian provinces in order to identify the two components. When considering alcoholic drinking data, it appears that only one of these components is associated with the consumption of alcohol, both for men and for women. In this way an estimate can be made of the proportion of mortality in Italy which can be linked to alcohol consumption. For males, this is 40.4% (47.1% for the North, 29.7% for Central Italy, and 33% for the South/Islands). For females, the average is 24.6% (36.6% for the North, 16.2% for Central Italy, and 12.3% for the South/Islands). In absolute terms, these figures represent approx 5000 of the 13,000 deaths per year among males and around 1200 of the 5000 deaths from cirrhosis among females.\r"

Several authors have discussed the problems involved and concluded that a multivariate approach often has to be preferred. Because until now such an approach has not often been used in practice and qualitative arguments for a multivariate approach are seldom supported by quantitative results, in this paper the use of univariate reference ranges is evaluated with a multivariate range as the standard, taking into account correlation coefficients. Probabilities of false positive and false negative results and predictive values are computed and displayed for decision rules based on two separate test results with an elliptic region as the gold standard. The conclusion is that the quality of the univariate approach is dependent on the correlation coefficient and on the choice of the decision rule. In the most important cases, however, it falls short compared with a multivariate approach. For example, the probability that a univariate positive result is false is around 50% for all values of the correlation coefficient, which is unacceptably high.\r"

J Chron Dis 1981; 34: 87-103) changes in sex- and age-specific mortality from all causes of death in England and Wales were studied in relation to changes in sex- and age-specific cigarette consumption. The absence of a consistent correlation between the two variables, and the general characteristics of the data, suggested that studies of sex ratios might provide a better test of the hypothesis that the association between smoking and mortality has a causal basis. In this paper temporal changes in the sex ratio of cumulative cigarette consumption by cohort, and of smoking rates by age, are considered in relation to changes in the sex ratio of mortality. Again, no consistent correlations emerge and it is evident that factors other than smoking have played a dominant part in determining recent changes in the sex ratio of mortality in all age groups from 35-39 to 80-84 years. Among these \"other factors\" are birth cohort effects that can be attributed, in part, to birth cohort changes in the sex ratio of mortality from bronchitis and emphysema. The present results, together with other evidence (vide supra; and Burch P. R. J. J Chron Dis 1984; 37: 148-156), show that great care needs to be exercised when attempts are made to deduce causation from epidemiologic surveys.\r"

In this paper an effort is made to determine whether American society is making satisfactory progress toward this goal. Two independent databases are analyzed: time diaries collected from a national sample of American adults in 1981; and the Simmons Market Research Bureau, Inc., survey undertaken in 1984. Participation of adults 25-64 in moderate to vigorous activities that included racquet sports, swimming, hiking, bicycling, skiing, jogging, outdoor gardening, skating, etc. is compared between the two time periods. After adjusting for social desirability bias the results indicated there were a similar number of non-participants of the activities analyzed in 1981 and 1984. There was, however, an increase in the number of adults participating occasionally in vigorous activity, although, there did not appear to be any increase in the number who were regularly active, i.e. at least 3 days/week. Thus, while there are indications that adults 25-64 years are adopting more vigorous activity, less than 20% were regular enough in 1984 for improvements in cardiovascular functioning to occur. Unless there were dramatic increases in the activity status of adults 18-24 years of age which was not assessed in this study, the 1990 goal is unlikely to be met.\r"

Cases and controls in both studies reported more smears over the previous 5 years than their medical records indicated; also patients reported their last smear as more recent than noted in physician files. Cancer cases were somewhat more accurate on frequency and timing of smears than the other patient groups. Patients tend to report more symptoms at interview than recorded in their files. Disagreements on smear results were probably because of differences in terminology, especially in distinguishing invasive from pre-cancerous conditions; cancer cases tended to report some dysplasias as cancer, but the controls in both studies under-reported dysplasia. If high physician response rates can be obtained, we would prefer to use physician records as the basis of evaluation of screening programs, especially when accurate dating of screening events is required. However it is less clear whether physician records are to be preferred, if the evaluation is to take symptoms into account.\r"

Ninety-six percent of patients age 60 or younger achieved a complete response (CR); none have relapsed. Overall, 88% of patients are alive and well and potentially in the survival plateau. For patients greater than 60 years, CR was obtained in 73%, with 42% potentially in the survival plateau, the difference resulting in part from four relapses, three toxic deaths, and one presumed unrelated death. These results in the elderly were paralleled by a relatively reduced ability to tolerate therapy. Toxicity was primarily pulmonary, occurring in 39% of patients, two of whom died. With an overall CR rate of 84%, of which 92% are sustained at a median follow-up of 40 months, COPBLAM III represents a highly effective treatment in a sizeable cohort of patients.\r"

In this phase II trial, 20 patients with stage III or IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were administered 10-EDAM at a dose of 80 mg/m2 once weekly for 5 weeks. No patient had previously received chemotherapy. Nineteen of the 20 patients were adequately treated for response assessment. Six of 19 patients (32%) experienced a major objective response (exact 95% confidence limits, 15% to 55%). The median duration of response has not been reached and will exceed 13 months. Mucositis was the most common toxicity observed. Leukopenia was seen in only 10%, and 15% had platelet nadirs less than 100,000/microL. At the dosage and schedule used, 10-EDAM is an active agent in patients with NSCLC who are previously untreated with chemotherapy with a predicted response rate greater than or equal to 15% (P = .05). Because of its level of antitumor activity and the fact that 10-EDAM causes minimal myelosuppression, it is a suitable agent for further study in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in this disease.\r"

Patients achieving either a complete or partial response and remaining in remission after completion of induction therapy were subsequently randomized to consolidation chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin 20 mg/m2 X 4 plus etoposide (VP-16) 100 mg/m2 X 4 every 4 weeks for two courses v no further therapy. There were 160 patients entered on the consolidation phase and 148 were fully evaluable. The median survival for patients randomized to cisplatin plus VP-16 (PVP16) from start of CAV chemotherapy was 97.7 weeks, compared with 68 weeks for the no-consolidation arm (P = .0094). PVP16 consolidation also significantly increased the duration of remission, with median durations of 49 weeks v 28 weeks (P = .0008). The median durations for partial remission were 41 weeks v 23 weeks (P = .013), and for complete remission, 52 weeks v 30.5 weeks (P = .0091). Furthermore, 18 patients on PVP16 consolidation remain in a continuous complete remission for 12+ months and 13 of these are continuously disease free 2+ years. Eight patients randomized to no consolidation remain in a continuous complete remission, with only four patients disease free 2+ years. PVP16 consolidation has significantly improved the duration of remission and overall survival and appears capable of improving the cure rate in limited SCLC.\r"

The model uses estimates of tumor volume obtained from computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest before each course of chemotherapy. Application of the model to a trial using single-agent high-dose cyclophosphamide (HDC) showed that HDC killed approximately 94% of the sensitive tumor on each application, but that the proportion of tumor resistant to HDC rose from an average of 1% to an average of 15% after the first cycle, assuming a 30-day tumor doubling time. These estimates proved fairly insensitive to different assumptions about tumor doubling time and inaccuracies in volume measurement and may thus provide a useful additional evaluation technique for some clinical trials.\r"

In a univariate analysis, significant favorable prognostic factors were good performance status (PS), duration of symptoms greater than 6 months at the time of diagnosis, early stage of disease, white race, and female sex. In a multivariate analysis, PS, race, duration of symptoms, and stage were of significance for a favorable prognosis. Age, pain as first symptom, histologic subtype, and RT dose were not of prognosis significance in this study. The stepwise addition of treatment modalities did not increase survival, which remained the same as that reported for untreated patients. Therefore, phase II trials of new agents offer the only hope for advance in the treatment of this disease.\r"

This complication occurred in 0.6% of 2362 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed at the Mayo Clinic from 1972 through 1986. All hemorrhages occurred within the first 2 weeks after operation and were ipsilateral to the side of the operation. Eight patients died, and only two made a good recovery. Significant risk factors are hypertension and chronic hemispheric hypoperfusion with impaired autoregulation. The \"normal pressure-hyperperfusion breakthrough\" syndrome was considered to be operative in 12 of the 14 patients. Nine patients had documented hyperperfusion (at least 100% increase of baseline cerebral blood flow) at the time of surgery. In an additional three patients, normal perfusion-pressure breakthrough was inferred by the clinical course and radiological findings, as well as by the absence of alternative explanations. Patients at risk for postendarterectomy intracerebral hemorrhage include those who have a clinical history suggestive of hemodynamic cerebral ischemia, severe carotid stenosis with limited hemispheric collateral flow, and postendarterectomy hyperperfusion, as measured by intraoperative cerebral blood flow. To minimize the risk of hemorrhage in these patients, strict maintenance of blood pressure at normotensive or even relatively hypotensive levels during the intraoperative and early postoperative periods is advised.\r"

The patients suffered from recurrent cerebral ischemic symptoms, and further operative intervention, including superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and intracranial omental transplantation, was performed. The choice of operative maneuver depended on the availability of scalp arteries and on the nature of the ischemic symptoms. Although indirect non-anastomotic revascularization procedures have the advantage of technical ease and most patients respond to these procedures alone, there are some patients like the 11 presented here who are not cured by such procedures. In such cases, direct anastomotic revascularization is necessary for the prevention of stroke.\r"

One patient had a large intramedullary cyst that accounted for only part of the enlargement, and one had multiple tumor nodules. Six other patients had no obvious explanation for the diffuse cord enlargement. This phenomenon of extensive spinal cord enlargement appears to be unique to this type of tumor and not related to multiple tumors or extensive cyst formation. The cord enlargement seems to be related to edema and congestion of the spinal cord, perhaps secondary to the vascular shunt present in the hemangioblastomas. The possible pathophysiology and clinical importance of this observation is discussed.\r"

The percentage of successful treatment (\"control rate\") was 68%, 30%, and 14%, respectively, in these three groups of patients. Based on these results, the authors offer guidelines for the management of patients with prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas associated with exceptionally high serum prolactin levels.

The frequency of hematoma enlargement, hematoma size, and changes in the level of consciousness and intracranial pressure (ICP) were examined in these patients. The hematomas enlarged in 24 (64.9%) of the 37 patients, and attained a maximum thickness of 25 mm or greater in 19 patients (51.3%). The level of consciousness could be closely observed during enlargement of the hematomas in 13 patients: the level remained unchanged in eight, deteriorated in two, and improved in three, indicating relative stability in the state of consciousness despite the marked changes in hematoma size. The patients whose hematoma enlarged after the initial examination included three who underwent initial CT examination 5 hours after the injury. In five patients enlargement of extradural hematomas was observed unexpectedly during conservative treatment under ICP monitoring. The ICP also remained stable in three patients until the follow-up examination, but showed a rapid increase in two after a period of stability. However, there was no difference in the final size of the hematomas between the patients showing an increase in ICP and those who did not. These findings suggest that extradural hematomas enlarge progressively at rates varying with the condition of the source of hemorrhage. Moreover, a period of stability in the level of consciousness, such as the lucid interval seen in patients with extradural hematoma, is considered to be a period during which compensatory mechanisms can maintain the stability of the intracranial condition during progressive enlargement of the hematoma.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that head injury can cause alterations of cerebral energy metabolism. However, the etiology of this metabolic perturbation is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of fluid-percussion trauma on cerebral energy metabolism. Seven ventilated, chloralose-anesthetized cats were subjected to a 3.2-atm fluid-percussion brain injury. Before and for 8 hours after trauma, continuous phosphorus-3 1 magnetic resonance spectrography was obtained to noninvasively monitor tissue pH, phosphocreatine (PCr), and inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels. Measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by the radioactive microsphere technique and calculation of oxygen and glucose consumption (CMRO2 and CMRG1) were also performed before trauma as well as 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after trauma. The data showed a moderate decrease in tissue pH from 7.04 to 6.89 at 30 minutes following trauma with return to control levels by 3 hours posttrauma. During the 8-hour observation period, CBF, CMRO2, and CMRG1 remained at control levels. Tissue PCr and Pi levels were also unchanged. Fluid-percussion trauma at the 3.2-atm level in ventilated cats causes a moderate and transient decrease in tissue pH that returns to control levels after trauma. No other metabolic changes are seen later than 30 minutes posttrauma. This indicates that a mild metabolic disturbance occurs after trauma in the ventilated animal and quickly returns to normal.\r"

The cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rates of oxygen (CMRO2) and glucose (CMRGl) were measured, with simultaneous phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy quantifications of cerebral tissue pH, phosphocreatine (PCr), and inorganic phosphate (Pi). Hypoventilation alone did not produce marked changes in CMRGl, tissue pH, or PCr:Pi ratios. When hypoventilation was combined with trauma, marked alterations in CBF, CMRGl, PCr:Pi ratio, and tissue pH were seen, indicating relative ischemia. The alterations of cerebral energy metabolism produced by combining trauma and hypoventilation are more severe than those caused by fluid-percussion trauma alone, and may provide a more realistic model of human head injury.\r"

Repair of the microvascular architecture had begun by the 3rd day after injury, with hematogenous cells and reactive astrocytes present in the edematous brain participating in the regenerative process. The normal microvascular architecture was reconstructed starting from the edge of the lesion nearest to the brain surface. On the other hand, in the most severely injured part of the brain surface, newly formed microvascular architecture appeared, resembling that of the developing fetal and newborn rat cortex. Seven days after injury, the entire microvascular architecture in the region of the lesion had been reconstructed.\r"

Radiological investigations revealed nodular calcifications, 5 to 7 mm in diameter, in the cervical ligamentum flavum compressing the spinal cord. Light microscopic, scanning electron microscopic, and x-ray diffraction studies were performed on all three surgical specimens obtained by laminectomy. In two of the cases x-ray microanalysis and transmission electron microscope studies were also performed. This study defined the presence of two patterns of crystal deposition in the ligamentum flavum. One is a nodular deposit, in which hydroxyapatite crystals are seen in the central part of the nodules, with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) being distributed thinly around them. The other pattern is a linear deposit seen in multiple ligaments and composed of pure CPPD, which causes minimal thickening of the ligaments. A transitional pattern between the two types was also observed. This study revealed details of the nodular deposition of crystals in the ligamentum flavum and demonstrates that CPPDcdd and so-called \"calcification of the ligamentum flavum\" are the same disease: namely, CPPDcdd. Hydroxyapatite is assumed to have been transformed from CPPD.\r"

In both cases, CSF pleocytosis was limited to 20 or 60 cells with variable protein and sugar values. Fever was a constant finding, frequently accompanied by signs of central nervous system dysfunction. Corynebacterium Group JK organisms are common contaminants of the normal skin flora. When isolated from the blood and/or the CSF of a patient with a CSF shunt who has symptoms and signs compatible with infection, the organism should not be dismissed as a contaminant. A significant feature of this group is its resistance to almost all presently available antibiotics including penicillin, the cephalosporins, and the aminoglycosides. These organisms are, however, sensitive to vancomycin.\r"

  ".W": "In order to select the optimal vasodilator for the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), the acute effects of three vasodilators (isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) 5 mg, nifedipine 10 mg, and prazosin 1 mg) on peripheral capacitance and resistance vessels (CV and RV) were evaluated by a newly devised radionuclear technique (Study 1). Thirty-six patients with chronic CHF were divided into Group A (ejection fraction (EF) greater than or equal to 35%, n = 20, mean EF: 47.2 +/- 6.5%) and B (EF less than 35%, n = 16, mean EF: 24.8 +/- 7.1%). ISDN produced the strongest CV dilatation (25% in both groups). Nifedipine reduced RV tone in Groups A and B (14% and 27%, respectively), and CV tone in Group A (6%). Prazosin had the most prominent effects on both vessels in Group B. From these results, it appeared: (a) ISDN is indicated for the cases with increased CV tone, (b) nifedipine is suitable for those with increased RV tone, (c) in cases of increased tone in both vessels, nifedipine (when EF greater than or equal to 35%) or prazosin (when EF less than 35%) is optimal. To evaluate the validity of this assignment, 49 subjects with CHF were divided into Group 1 (n = 16, increased CV tone), Group 2 (n = 17, increased RV tone), and Group 3 (n = 16, increased CV and RV tone) in Study 2. In Group 1, the changes of all indexes were not significantly different between the subjects treated with optimal drug based on the assignment (subgroup P) and those with a non-optimal drug (subgroup N) after 2 wk of therapy. In Group 2, however, improvements of RV tone, EF, and exercise duration in subgroup P were greater than those in subgroup N (31 versus 10%, 21 versus 0%, 41 versus 14%, respectively). In Group 3, the results were the same as in Group 2 (34 versus 19%, 24 versus 8%, 26 versus 9%). These findings suggested that the selection of the optimal vasodilator based on peripheral hemodynamic evaluation with a newly devised radionuclear technique permits more effective treatment of chronic CHF.\r"

In the healthy subjects, the Sl was 1.9-5.2% (mean 4.1%). In hepatitis, the mean Sl was 7.1%, and in cirrhosis, 52.9%. The Sl was higher in cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices than in those without (p less than 0.001), and in cirrhotic patients with encephalopathy than in those without (p less than 0.01). For some patients with portal hypertension, portal collateral circulation could be depicted, and images of changes in the portal collateral circulation after vascular anastomosis were seen.\r"

This study examines new and existing methods for determining the relevant contribution made by the hepatic artery and portal vein to total liver blood flow, from these first pass studies. Eighty-two studies were performed in 56 patients with both normal and abnormal liver function. Using region of interest analysis, time-activity curves were obtained for the lungs, liver, spleen, and left kidney. These curves were analyzed by four different methods. Two of these methods are based upon measurement of the slopes of the uptake and washout curves from the liver and spleen and the other two methods employ deconvolution analysis to permit area measurement under the deconvolved curves as an indicator of blood flow. All four methods showed a small intraobserver variation after reanalysis. In 11 patients who underwent repeat studies, the correlation between the deconvolution based methods (r = 0.79-0.89) was significantly better than that for the slope based methods (r = 0.55-0.58). The deconvolution based methods provided the most significant separation between normals and patients with various liver disorders and would appear to be the most suitable techniques for monitoring the effects of various drugs and surgical procedures on the relative arterial/portal contribution to hepatic blood flow.\r"

To achieve this, three-dimensional radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy (RNLS) was performed in 167 patients by obtaining two images of the nodes using a 30-degree slant hole collimator rotated 180 degrees between images. Analysis of 768 nodes (mean 4.6/patient) visualized from the level of rib 1 through interspace 5 was performed. The number of nodes seen was not a function of patient age. Cross-communication to the contralateral node chain occurred in 13.8% of cases. Eighty-two percent of nodes were located near the first three ribs and interspaces; 23% were located beyond 3.0 cm from the mid-sternal line. At the level of the radiation beam match line (second rib or interspace), 4.5% of nodes were deeper than 3.0 cm. From rib 3 through interspace 5, 3.9% were deeper than 3.0 cm. Using an idealized tangential field, at least one node would have been missed in 16.2% of patients. Three-dimensional RNLS allows definition and localization of normal sized nodes and ensures that radiation therapy portals can be tailored for each individual under treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Gallium-67 chelated to nitrilotriacetic acid was encapsulated in liposomes composed of various phospholipids, and 67Ga delivery potential to the tumor after intravenous injection of these liposomes was examined. Tumor uptake of the liposomes themselves and their stability in the serum were also studied. It was found that liposomes composed of distearoylphosphatidylcholine, diarachidoylphosphatidylcholine, or sphingomyelin with cholesterol (molar ratio of phospholipid:cholesterol, 2:1) could be taken by the tumor effectively and could deliver large amounts of 67Ga to the tumor. They could also give high 67Ga accumulation ratios (tumor to the other tissues). The study of liposomal stability in the serum suggested that the marked 67Ga accumulation in the tumor resulted from the serum stability of the liposomal bilayer, i.e., the stable liposomes in the blood circulation could reach the tumor in large quantities after i.v. injection. These observations indicate that liposomes with an appropriate lipid composition may be an excellent tool to accumulate 67Ga in tumors.\r"

Inaccuracies in the reference value are propagated to the rest of the curve values. NEMA also requires the measurement of individual attenuation factors for every absorber. Errors can easily occur during the measurement and during the subsequent calculations which utilize these factors. An alternative approach is suggested: count rate curves are based upon at least five low count rate values and the determination of individual attenuation factors is eliminated. Count rate curves are generated from graphs of the 1n of the observed count rate against the number of equally thick copper absorber plates, by back-extrapolation of a line which is fitted to the linear low count rate data. The method was successfully implemented in practice. Agreement was found between the results of the NEMA method and the alternative method suggested.\r"

We developed the conjugate-view method of imaging using 131I reference sources of known radioactivity placed on the surface of the patient and standard nuclear medicine equipment (gamma camera and computer), to estimate tumor uptake of [131I]MIBG. Such an estimate is a first step toward calculating radiation absorbed dose. Three different methods of background subtraction were evaluated with an anthropomorphic phantom and in five patients. In phantom results, measured tumor activity decreased exponentially with a half-life in agreement with that of 131I to within 3%. However, in the phantom studies, in which non-tumor activity is zero, no single method of background subtraction is superior. In patients, two background subtraction methods, which take their estimate from regions immediately surrounding or adjacent to the tumor and reference source, are less sensitive to reference source position and appear more accurate than a third method which uses a background region of interest displaced from the tumor. The agreement of the calculated activity concentration (nCi/g) with that measured by counting portions of the excised tumors gives validation to the method.\r"

Metastatic 85Sr activity corrected for tissue attenuation was measured using the conjugate view principle, with special care taken to eliminate errors due to the selection of the metastatic region of interest. Metastatic volume was determined from high resolution CT images, and density inferred from Hounsfield number using the QCT bone mineral calibration of Genant and Cann. The mean absorbed dose was 850 rad/mCi (23 cGy/MBq) with a range from 220-2260 rad/mCi (6 to 61 cGy/MBq). The wide range found was consistent with the variation expected to arise due to differences in strontium renal plasma clearance (range 0.1-11.81/day) and extent of skeletal metastatic disease (varying from two small metastases to a superscan on [99mTc]MDP images) among the patients studied.\r"

The mass of phospholipid classes in rat heart mitochondria was not changed, but their fatty acid compositions were altered. Modification of the fatty acid compositions of mitochondrial phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine reached a plateau after 10 d of feeding, but that of cardiolipin continued for 30 d. The O2 consumption rate of rat heart mitochondria decreased as the fatty acid composition of the phospholipids changed. This may be due to the reduction of the activity of cytochrome c oxidase, which requires cardiolipin for its activity. However, F1F0-ATPase, which also requires cardiolipin, was activated under the same conditions.\r"

Effects of excess leucine were tested in kittens fed five basal diets that varied in their nitrogen and amino acid contents. Compared to rats, kittens were much less sensitive to excesses of the BCAA. Addition of 10% leucine to basal diets that provided nitrogen just at or below the minimal requirement of kittens resulted in no change or increased growth and food intake of kittens when the isoleucine and valine concentrations in the basal diet were just at or slightly in excess of the kitten's minimal requirements for those amino acids. An adverse effect of leucine added to low nitrogen basal diets was observed only when isoleucine and valine were provided below the kitten's requirement (80% of requirement). When basal diets containing adequate nitrogen (24% amino acids) were tested, the addition of leucine (10%) resulted in an adverse effect when isoleucine and valine were provided at 80% of the kitten's requirement and in mild growth depressions when isoleucine and valine were provided at 1.1 times the requirement. Leucine-induced growth depression was alleviated by the addition of isoleucine and valine at 0.5%, indicating that excess leucine caused a BCAA antagonism or an amino acid imbalance. With the addition of leucine to the basal diets, there were consistent decreases in concentrations of alanine and tyrosine in plasma but no consistent depressions in the concentrations of isoleucine and valine.\r"

Short-chain fatty acids were formed from all mono- and disaccharides tested (except L-glucose): D-glucose, D-galactose, D-fructose, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, D-sorbitol, D-arabinose, D-xylose, D-ribose, D-galacturonate, D-glucuronate, lactose and lactulose. All saccharides increased acetate formation; propionate production was increased from rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, ribose, galacturonic and glucuronic acid, whereas the synthesis of butyrate was elevated in assays incubated with sorbitol, galacturonic and glucuronic acid, and to a lesser degree ribose. Isobutyrate, valerate, isovalerate and hexanoate were produced in increased amounts in assays incubated with albumin, but in fact decreased in many incubations with saccharides. It is speculated that saccharide fermentation always results in formation of acetate, and that the relative production of acetate, propionate and butyrate is related to the monosaccharide composition of dietary fiber available for colonic bacteria. However, the production of isobutyrate, valerate, isovalerate and hexanoate is probably not due to saccharide fermentation, but is rather of polypeptide origin.\r"

Radiolabeled polyethylene glycol-4000 was used as nonabsorbable water-phase marker, and the formation of free arabinose was used to quantify the hydrolysis of dietary fibers. Ingested fibers, aspirates and urine specimens were analyzed for monosaccharides, either free or fiber-bound, by gas-liquid chromatography. Both types of fiber were hydrolyzed in the stomach, but not in the small bowel. Of ispaghula husk, 1-6% was hydrolyzed, as was 5-8% of wheat bran. Intestinal absorption of free arabinose was 85-93%, but excretion of arabinose in the urine was not greater than after control meals. For further evaluation of gastric hydrolysis six additional healthy male volunteers were studied by serial aspirations from the antral part of the stomach. Hydrolysis was instantaneous for both fibers, and was significantly more pronounced for wheat bran than for ispaghula husk.\r"

To determine how seals cope with high vitamin D intakes, the metabolism of tritiated cholecalciferol ([3H]D3) was investigated in hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) pups during their postweaning fast and pups and adults consuming herring alone or supplemented with 400,000 iu D3 daily. [3H]D3 was metabolized to 25-[3H]OHD3 and 24,25-[3H](OH)2D3. 1,25-[3H](OH)2D3 was not detected, but plasma levels of 1,25-(OH)2D were similar to those in other mammals and were not affected by vitamin D intake. Plasma vitamin D, 25-OHD and 24,25-(OH)2D increased with vitamin D intake, but 25-OHD did not increase to the extent seen in other mammals. The supplemented seals showed no evidence of toxicity. Levels of 24,25-(OH)2D were higher in the unsupplemented seals (4 to 33 ng/mL) than reported in other mammals with similar 25-OHD levels and did not decrease with 25-OHD. High levels of 24,25-(OH)2D relative to 25-OHD have also been found in hooded seals in the wild. The half-lives of vitamin D, 25-OHD and 24,25-(OH)2D were shorter than those reported for most other mammals. Increased conversion of 25-OHD to 24,25-(OH)2D and a high capacity for vitamin D storage in their large blubber mass appeared to be factors in the resistance of seals to vitamin D toxicity.\r"

Relative to the normal range, percent compositions of an odd-chain fatty acid (either 15:0 or 17:0 or both) were increased in each class of lipid, and these abnormalities generally returned to normal or decreased toward normal with biotin therapy. Abnormalities in particular fatty acids in the omega 6, omega 3 and omega 9 pathways were also found, but these abnormalities did not resolve with biotin therapy. These data provide evidence in favor of the conclusion that biotin deficiency causes increases in the composition of some odd-chain fatty acids in humans, perhaps by the same mechanism that leads to odd-chain fatty acidemia in the inborn deficiency of the biotin-dependent enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase.\r"

Animals were injected intraperitoneally with isotope, and whole-body and tissue turnover of 65Zn was measured. Biological half-life of whole-body 65Zn for pregnant females was 129% of that for nonpregnant, nonlactating females of similar age (25.7 and 20.0 d, respectively). Conversely, the half-life of zinc was less for lactating (11.1 d) and aged (15.3 d) females than for either pregnant or nonpregnant, nonlactating young adult females. Retention of 65Zn was generally lower for all tissues of pregnant and lactating dams than for nonpregnant, nonlactating females except for brain and tibia. In aged females, specific activity at 20 d postinjection did not differ from that of nonpregnant, nonlactating young adult females for any tissue except bone. While specific activity of tibia increased during pregnancy and lactation, it was lower in aged females than in nonpregnant, nonlactating young adult females. Increased organ content of zinc resulted from changes in zinc concentration or in organ mass or both, and was supported by increased food intake. Thus, greater food intake for these groups than for young adult females contributed to the higher turnover of tissue 65Zn. Differences in concentrations of Cu, Ca and Mg were also observed among groups for some tissues; the significance of these differences and their relationship to zinc metabolism are not clear.\r"

  ".W": "Deposition of fluoride (F) in the skeleton is a major factor in the metabolic regulation of F. The progressive increase in bone F levels with age suggests that F is rather firmly sequestered once it is deposited in bone. We have examined the extent to which F is resorbed and redeposited during bone turnover in growing rats. The skeleton was first preloaded with F by intake of water containing a high level of F (50 mg F/L) and simultaneously labeled with [3H]tetracycline (3H-TC) to provide a measure of subsequent bone turnover. Rats were then changed to a very low F intake, and bone F loss was compared with 3H-TC loss in animals undergoing normal bone turnover or turnover accelerated by a low calcium (Ca) intake. Approximately 60% of F mobilized during bone resorption was redeposited in the skeleton (humerus and vertebrae). The redeposition of F showed a positive correlation with mineral deposition. Thus the retention of F in the skeleton of growing rats results predominantly from redeposition of resorbed F rather than passive retention associated with low bone turnover.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effect of dietary methionine on the bioavailability of Se from selenomethionine ([Se]Met), weanling rats were first loaded with Se by feeding 0.5 mg Se as [Se]Met per kg diet of a low methionine (0.17% by analysis) torula yeast-based diet for 21 d, and then were fed an Se-deficient diet (less than 0.02 mg Se/kg) supplemented with 0, 0.4 or 0.9% methionine for 28 d. Plasma, liver and muscle Se increased 2.6-, 2.5- and 2.2-fold, respectively, during [Se]Met supplementation, and then the tissue Se declined exponentially during the Se-deficient diet period. Plasma, liver and muscle glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities decreased 43-50% during the [Se]Met supplementation period in spite of the increase in tissue Se. When these [Se]Met-loaded rats were fed the Se-deficient diet and supplemented with methionine, tissue GSH-Px activities increased significantly within 3 to 7 d, but then decreased for the remainder of the experiment. Calculation of the percentage of tissue Se present as Se in GSH-Px indicated that substantial Se from dietary [Se]Met was stored in tissues in a form different from GSH-Px when a low methionine diet was fed. These results indicate that the dietary methionine level can modulate the availability of Se from dietary [Se]Met and from stored tissue [Se]Met; the inability of stored [Se]Met to provide Se for GSH-Px synthesis over a prolonged period of time suggests that [Se]Met may not be an optimum form for Se supplementation.\r"

Linear response was closely approximated for concentrations below those yielding maximum growth. Derivatization of L-methionine generally lowered potency, calculated as the ratio of the slopes of the two dose-response curves. However, the three isomeric dipeptides L-L-, L-D- and D-L-methionylmethionine, N-acetyl- and N-formyl-L-methionine, L-methionine sulfoxide and D-methionine were well utilized. The double derivative N-acetyl-L-methionine sulfoxide reduced potency below 60%. D-Methionine sulfoxide, N-acetyl-D-methionine and D-methionyl-D-methionine had potencies between 4 and 40%. The calcium salts of L- and D-alpha-hydroxy analogs of methionine had potencies of 55.4 and 85.7%, respectively. Several of the analogs were less growth-inhibiting or toxic at high concentrations in the diet than was L-methionine. These results imply that some methionine dipeptides or analogs may be better candidates for fortifying foods than L-methionine. Possible biochemical pathways for the utilization of methionine derivatives and analogs are also described.\r"

Hepatocytes were isolated and used as a source of RNA, de novo radiolabeled protein and postmitochondrial supernatant for enzyme assay. Dietary safflower oil, as a source of linoleic acid, repressed G6PD activity, synthesis and mRNA levels two- to threefold without significantly changing the amount of carbohydrate consumed. Similar but smaller changes were observed for 6PGD. Dietary fat + TYA (an analogue of arachidonate that inhibits normal metabolism of linoleic acid) prevented the fat-dependent lowering of G6PD and 6PGD activity, synthesis and mRNA levels. Our results suggest that a metabolite of linoleic acid regulates the activity of two lipogenic enzymes, G6PD and 6PGD, by lowering gene expression or mRNA processing or stability.\r"

In contrast, the feeding of polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons results in an elevated level of circulatory retinol. We investigated the effect of short-term dietary exposure to RA on the amount of serum retinol in female Sprague-Dawley rats fed either a basal diet (control rats) or the basal diet containing 100 mg of polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs)/kg diet (PBB-treated rats). After feeding of the above diets for 137 d, RA (12 mg/kg diet) was included in both the control and PBB-containing diets. The rats were fed the RA-containing diet for 3 d and then killed (d 140). Blood samples were obtained before and after RA treatment. Chronic PBB treatment of rats resulted in lower hepatic vitamin A and higher kidney vitamin A than in control rats. Serum retinol concentration was significantly higher in rats treated with PBB for 137 d than in controls; the subsequent treatment with RA lowered serum retinol to a level that was not different from that of control rats treated with RA. Our observations agree with earlier findings that 1) PBB treatment alters vitamin A homeostasis, and 2) dietary RA lowers the amount of circulatory retinol. An important new observation is that serum retinol homeostasis in PBB-treated rats appears to be regulated by a mechanism similar to that of normal rats. Polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons may thus be useful tools to study the control mechanisms of vitamin A homeostasis.\r"

Information on perinatal events for both the children with cerebral palsy and the control subjects was collected by means of epidemiologic methods to reduce bias. An association between clinically observed perinatal signs of birth asphyxia and spastic cerebral palsy was found (relative risk 2.84; 95% confidence interval 1.85 to 4.37). The population-attributable risk proportion was 14.1%. The likelihood of birth asphyxia's causing perinatal brain damage was assessed by two independent observers using defined criteria. It was estimated that in only about 8% (15/183) of all the children with spastic cerebral palsy was intrapartum asphyxia the possible cause of their brain damage. The contribution of intrapartum events and obstetric mismanagement to overall cerebral palsy rates is probably less than was previously thought.\r"

Of the study group, 106 children had been exposed to antiepileptic drugs (82 to phenytoin) during pregnancy; 44 (36%) mothers had had generalized convulsions during pregnancy. One hundred fourteen mothers and 87 fathers of study group children and 101 mothers and 58 fathers of control children were also examined. A significant excess of minor anomalies considered characteristic of hydantoin syndrome was observed in children of epileptic mothers and in epileptic mothers, compared with the control group. There was no excess of other minor anomalies studied. Several minor anomalies previously regarded as typical of fetal hydantoin syndrome were shown to be genetically linked to epilepsy. Only hypertelorism and digital hypoplasia were associated with phenytoin exposure. The current concept of the syndrome seems to be incorrect; most of the \"typical\" characteristics are not caused by phenytoin. None of the phenytoin-exposed children had all of the main characteristics of hydantoin syndrome (typical acrofacial features, intellectual deficiency, growth retardation, and microcephaly). The risk of developmental disturbance associated with intrauterine phenytoin exposure seems to be much lower than the 7% to 11% risk of fetal hydantoin syndrome reported earlier.\r"

Severe illnesses were defined by high fever, duration exceeding 10 days, or physician visit. Children remaining in their original child care group for at least 1 year were compared with regard to the frequency and severity of illness. Children in group care and day care were more likely than children in home care to experience at least six respiratory infections, more than 60 days of illness, and more than four severe illnesses (P less than 0.01). Similarly, life table analyses showed that children in home care had fewer episodes of infection than did children in day care (P less than 0.01). Although no children were hospitalized because of acute infections during the first year of study, hospitalization for myringotomy and tube placement occurred in 21% of children in day care and 3% of children in home care (P less than 0.01).\r"

It identified 35 DDST items that would identify 100% abnormal and 97.9% abnormal and questionable DDSTs. A further validation with 113 Pitt County, North Carolina, children indicated that the addition of four more DDST items to the previous 35 would identify 100% abnormal and 92.6% abnormal and questionable DDSTs.

The 39 key DDST items ranged throughout the entire age span and among the DDST's four sectors. Use requires the administration of approximately four items at any one age, on average. Those children with suspect scores on the key DDST items (about 19% of a low-income population) should be screened with the remainder of the DDST to decrease overreferrals. For accuracy, the key DDST items must be administered in the manner prescribed in the DDST manual.\r"
