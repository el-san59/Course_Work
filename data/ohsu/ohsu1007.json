  ".W": "Following the development of methods for eliciting and purifying digoxin-specific Fab fragments with high affinity and specificity for cardiac glycosides, clinical studies were undertaken as a multicenter, open-label trial to test safety and efficacy in patients with advanced and potentially life-threatening digitalis toxicity that failed to respond to conventional therapeutic measures. One-hundred fifty such patients were treated with digoxin-specific antibody fragments purified from immunoglobulin G (IgG) produced in sheep. Doses of Fab were equivalent to the amount of digoxin or digitoxin in the patient's body, as estimated from the medical history or serum concentration measurements. Of 150 patients included in this trial, detailed information is available on 148. One-hundred nineteen (80%) had resolution of all signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity following specific Fab fragment infusions, 14 (10%) improved, and 15 (10%) showed no response. Among 14 patients with adverse events possibly or probably caused by Fab, the most common events were development of hypokalemia and exacerbation of congestive heart failure. Analysis of the available clinical data indicates that a treatment response was observed in at least 90% of patients with convincing evidence of advanced and potentially life-threatening digitalis toxicity. The data from this multicenter trial have been augmented by findings from an observational surveillance study conducted to monitor the safety and effectiveness of treatment with digoxin immune Fab (ovine) following commercial availability. In this experience, 74% of patients were judged to have a complete or partial response to treatment, and 12% no response. The response for the remaining 14% was not reported or reported as uncertain. In this clinical experience, digoxin-specific Fab was generally well tolerated and clinically effective in patients with potentially life-threatening digitalis toxicity.\r"

  ".U": "91144650\r", 
  ".W": "The incidence of digoxin toxicity increases with age, largely because the two most common conditions that benefit from use of digoxin, congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation, are markedly more prevalent in old age. Whether the elderly are more sensitive to the effects of digoxin because of age per se is unclear. However, several other factors render the elderly more susceptible to digoxin toxicity. These include an age-related decline in renal function and a decrease in volume of digoxin distribution. There is also an increase in the number of comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which heighten susceptibility to digoxin toxicity. Moreover, treatment of these diseases with such interactive medications as quinidine and calcium channel blockers may increase the serum level of digoxin. Similarly, such electrolyte imbalances as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia occur more frequently in the elderly as a result of diuretic therapy. However, recent data suggest that manifestations of digoxin toxicity among younger and older patients do not differ. Similar incidences of cardiac toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and altered mental status are found in both patient populations. Treatment of digitalis toxicity in the elderly is the same as for younger patients. Response rates to Digibind are not diminished in the elderly.\r"

In this article the previous use of digoxin-specific antibody Fab fragments to treat digitalis overdose or intoxication in children is reviewed. The case reports cited in the medical literature and the 57 pediatric cases gathered as a result of the multicenter clinical trial and postmarketing surveillance study reported here indicate that digoxin-specific antibody Fab fragments are effective in ameliorating signs of digitalis poisoning in children. Not only can Fab fragments rapidly eradicate potentially life-threatening arrhythmias and conduction defects, but they are also effective in treating hyperkalemia and other noncardiac manifestations of digitalis toxicity. In the small samples of patients studied to date, complications have been minimal and no allergic reactions to digoxin-specific Fab fragments have been observed. Recommendations for the management of digitalis intoxication in children are outlined.\r"

  ".W": "Digibind is a purified antigen binding fragment (Fab) of immunoglobulin G antibodies raised to bind digoxin. Studies in animals suggest renal excretion accounts for a substantial portion of Fab's elimination. Thus it is expected that elimination of antidigoxin Fab fragments would be prolonged in patients with renal impairment; it remains unclear whether digoxin might be released with possible recurrence of toxicity. To shed light on this potential for recrudescent digitalis toxicity following release of bound digoxin, the author scrutinized the records of patients with impaired renal function who were treated with Digibind. Data are available from three sources: the original multicenter investigation of Digibind in 150 patients with life-threatening digoxin or digitoxin toxicity, a postmarketing surveillance study of 745 patients treated with Digibind, and all other reports in the literature or to Burroughs Wellcome Co of physician experience with any antidigoxin Fab. Sixty percent of patients in the multicenter trial and 80% of patients in the postmarketing surveillance trial had some degree of renal impairment. Patients with poor renal function had no evidence of decreased effectiveness or safety either in terms of percent of patients responding, onset of effect or evidence of recrudescence. From all sources the authors identified 28 patients treated with Fab who were functionally anephric. Twenty-seven of these patients had no evidence of recrudescent toxicity. One patient was reported to have complete resolution of digoxin-induced third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, but AV block recurred 10 days after Fab treatment and persisted for 10 days thereafter. Although this case offers the only clinical evidence suggesting recrudescence can occur, there were no likely alternative explanations for the clinical findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91144653\r", 
  ".W": "Digoxin excess can produce characteristic bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, and hyperkalemia. The bradyarrhythmias, which consist of disturbances in conduction and block at the level of the atrioventricular and sinus nodes, are mediated by a direct and vagotonic effect. The vagotonic effect of excess digoxin may also result in a marked slowing of the sinus rate in the setting of severe toxicity. Digoxin increases automatic and triggered electrical activity in atrial muscle, His-Purkinje system, and ventricular muscle, which predisposes to tachycardias. Many of the tachyarrhythmias are relatively specific for the toxic effects of digoxin. Atrial tachycardias with variable atrioventricular block, accelerated junctional rhythms (especially in the setting of atrial fibrillation), and fascicular tachycardias are characteristic digoxin toxic rhythms. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments should be considered the treatment of choice for any digoxin toxic arrhythmia associated with hemodynamic compromise or the threat of hemodynamic compromise. Hyperkalemia, when due to acute severe digoxin toxicity, is also an appropriate indication for digoxin-specific Fab fragment therapy. When assessing the risk:benefit ratio for using digoxin-specific Fab fragment therapy, one needs to determine, in addition to the electrocardiographic manifestations and patient's hemodynamic status (1) the severity of toxicity, as indexed by the amount ingested and/or the serum digoxin concentration; (2) the expected time course for reversal of toxicity, which is usually determined by the status of renal function; (3) the need for digoxin to provide ventricular rate control or improved ventricular contractility and therapeutic alternatives to digoxin; (4) the presence of a strong allergy history; (5) the presence of such factors as increased age and severity of heart disease that may predispose to digoxin toxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91144654\r", 
  ".W": "Digitalis intoxication is among the most common serious adverse drug reactions in clinical medicine. While the recent development of a radioimmunoassay to accurately measure serum concentrations of digoxin has been of assistance, digitalis intoxication remains a difficult diagnosis to make with certainty. The difficulty in diagnosing digitalis intoxication arises from the nonspecificity of its associated signs and symptoms. The most common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, nausea, and anorexia. These symptoms can occur with many illnesses other than digitalis intoxication. Similarly, the electrocardiographic disturbances caused by cardiac glycosides may be nondiagnostic. The arrhythmias commonly associated with digitalis toxicity are often nonspecific and can be a reflection of the patient's underlying heart disease. The measurement of serum digoxin levels is useful, but studies have demonstrated overlap of the levels between groups with and without toxicity. Due to the modulation of the cardiac effects of digitalis glycosides by such clinical variables as underlying myocardial or renal disease, electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, and other factors, the correlation of toxicity with particular serum digoxin concentrations may vary. Because of the inherent difficulties in confirming the diagnosis of digitalis intoxication in some cases, digoxin-specific Fab antibodies may play a role as a diagnostic tool. Certainly, digoxin-specific Fab antibodies play a significant part in the treatment of digitalis intoxication. Fab antibodies have been successfully used to reverse the effects of digoxin, digitoxin, and oleander poisoning. These antibodies are useful in the treatment of acute and chronic digitalis intoxication in all age groups, including geriatric and pediatric populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Seven hundred seventeen adult patients with life-threatening digitalis intoxication were treated with Fab fragments of ovine antidigoxin immunoglobulin G (IgG). Results of the efficacy of treatment and adverse effects were collected with standard report forms. Eighty-two (11%) of the patients were recorded as having histories of allergy (71 patients) and/or asthma (11 patients). Of the \"allergic\" subjects, 35 described reactions to antibiotics, 19 to other medications, 3 to foods, and 2 to pollens; in 12 subjects the etiologic agent was not specified. Six subjects had adverse reactions that were probably or possibly due to allergy to components of the antibody preparation. Of these 4 (5%; 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.8% to 12%) occurred in the 82 subjects with histories of allergy or asthma and 3 (9%; 95% Cl 1.8% to 23%) of these occurred in the 35 persons with histories of allergy to an antibiotic. In contrast, only 2 (0.3%; 95% Cl 0.04% to 1.1%) similar reactions occurred in the 635 subjects with no histories of allergy or asthma. All reactions responded to symptomatic treatment. The authors conclude that treatment of digitalis intoxication with ovine antidigoxin IgG-Fab (Digibind) is generally well tolerated and allergic reactions are rare. However, there is a significantly increased risk of reactions in patients with histories of allergy or asthma.\r"

Concerns that have been raised in the past concerning the training of physician-scientists are reviewed and general statements are made about their current availability. The status and health of M.D.-Ph.D. programs are discussed, because many think this kind of program is an important mechanism for training the biomedical researchers of the future. New initiatives under way to encourage careers in research are considered and recommendations are made for the future support of research training and encouragement of the exceptional young people who are entering the research pipeline.\r"

The tough problems giving rise to debates regarding data ownership and access are ethical problems rather than legal ones; these will remain unsettled for some time because at present there is no consensus concerning what constitutes ethical conduct among scholars and scientists and how seriously and in what manner to penalize breaches of that conduct. Access to data is a thorny issue; case histories illustrate the legal and ethical difficulties involved in questions of who has access to information compiled in the course of academic inquiry, and for what purpose. Much depends on the ethics and established procedures of the employing institution, but current case law suggests that a faculty member or institutional researcher does not have any legal right to review the data developed by a colleague. The author recommends that institutions clearly state their policies regarding ownership of data, and presents guidelines for such a policy.\r"

Enrollment is mandatory for approximately half of Philadelphia's medical assistance population. Participating primary care sites receive monthly capitation for enrollees and serve as \"gatekeepers\" for specialty and inpatient services. The report discusses why the academic medical center chose to participate in the program and how existing activities were modified to meet both increased demand for primary care and increased administrative requirements. It also identifies characteristics of the HealthPASS program and of the medical center that have impeded effective case management of care for the urban poor population that the program serves. Improving the quality of care for the medically indigent while controlling costs is essential, but political realities and the special needs of the Medicaid population must be acknowledged. Increased attention must be given to the impact that political compromises have on the design and effectiveness of a managed care program.\r"

Reasons for leaving varied, including being required to leave, career choice, personal reasons, and especially dissatisfaction with the job. Only half of current chairmen identified one or more qualified applicants for chairmanship within their own departments. The formal training and experience of these potential chairmen strongly resembled the training and experience of current chairmen, especially the fact that they had little training or experience in research. In the 1990s, the demand for academic chairmen of family medicine is likely to be large, the competition for capable candidates keen, and the challenges great for new chairmen, who will probably be young, residency-trained family physicians with relatively limited academic experience.\r"

Major diagnoses were abstracted from the reports of 200 autopsies of adults performed in 1968 and from a period 20 years later (1987, 1988, and part of 1989). Comparison between the two eras' diagnoses revealed very few changes in the incidences of various diseases. This was true even though the racial mix of patients had changed markedly. While declining autopsy rates are of concern, this study suggests that medical educators may not need to be concerned over the variety of autopsy case material. The author makes several suggestions for maximizing the teaching impact of each autopsy.\r"

These faculty viewed the reenactments (under the impression they were actual examinations) and rated the \"students\" performances overall and in ten categories concerning different aspects of the students' knowledge, clinical decision-making skills, and personal characteristics. The performances done in Style A were rated significantly higher than those done in Style B (1) in every performance category except decision making and (2) when the scores were classified by the content of the responses and how professionally dressed the students were. There were also a significant relationship between scores on communication skills and the overall all scores on examinations. These findings suggest that regardless of the content of a student's responses on an oral examination, evaluators are strongly influenced by how well the student communicates.\r"

By consulting school records, the authors ascertained the courses actually taken, the number of weeks that students actually devoted to them, and the sequence of courses, both for those students following an independent-study curriculum and for those following a traditional one. These data were compared with the corresponding data concerning the traditional curriculum requirements to determine whether the curricula the students actually followed, in either style, showed any marked difference from the required curriculum. The findings showed that the curricula followed by the independent-study students deviated considerably from both the requirements of the traditional curriculum and also the actual curricula followed by the students using the traditional curriculum, who almost never chose to deviate from the requirements. The independent-study students showed considerable intragroup variation in the ways they organized their curricula, most commonly in eliminating selected formal clerkship or specialty medicine courses, or altering the duration of clerkships. Elective coursework was substituted for formal clerkship experiences in the majority of cases where clerkship courses were eliminated.\r"

Dose-response curves for thiopentone and midazolam individually and in combination were determined using the two end-points in 300 unpremedicated patients. For hypnosis a highly significant (P less than 0.001) supra-addictive (synergistic) interaction was found, the combination having 1.8 times the expected potency of the individual agents. Although midazolam failed to produce anaesthesia in the dose range used, the dose of thiopentone required to produce anaesthesia was reduced by 50% in the presence of midazolam. The mechanism of interaction and the potential role of benzodiazepine-barbiturate combinations are discussed and the observed synergistic anaesthesia interaction is used to explain the potentially dangerous combination of benzodiazepines with other potent CNS depressants such as barbiturates and alcohol.\r"

Constant infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine 0.25 mg kg-1 h-1 was continued for 24 h. During surgery light general anaesthesia, without analgesics, was maintained. Plasma concentrations of total and unbound (free fraction) bupivacaine, desbutylbupivacaine (DBB), 4-hydroxybupivacaine (4-OHB) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) were measured at predetermined intervals during the continuous block. The greatest mean plasma concentrations of bupivacaine were measured at 30 min (1.63 (SD 0.55) micrograms ml-1) and 60 min (1.38 (0.48) micrograms ml-1). There was a small but statistically significant increase in the plasma concentration of bupivacaine between 12 and 24 h of infusion. The mean unbound concentration of bupivacaine in plasma decreased from 0.044 (0.015) microgram ml-1 (3.6 (1.1)% of total bupivacaine concentration) at 3 h to 0.023 (0.011) micrograms ml-1 (2.1 (1.0)%) at 24 h. The AAG concentration in plasma increased by 38% in 24 h. The metabolites DBB and 4-OHB were detectable in plasma from 30 min, with a gradual increase during infusion. At 24 h the mean concentrations of DBB and 4-OHB were 0.33 (0.22) micrograms ml-1 and 0.13 (0.04) micrograms ml-1, respectively. There were no toxic reactions during the blocks.\r"

There was little difference between the groups with respect to speed of onset or sensory block. The duration of analgesia was increased by increasing the concentration of both drugs, but this had minimal effect on onset time or extent of block. When the same concentration of each drug was administered, there were inconsistent differences in duration of sensory block, none of which was statistically significant. Increasing concentration of both drugs resulted in greater degree and longer duration of motor block. Ropivacaine produced a slower onset, shorter duration and less intense motor block than the same concentration of bupivacaine. The cardiovascular changes were similar in all groups.\r"

The other 50% were instructed to ingest unlimited clear fluids up to 3 h before surgery. On arrival in the operating room, subjects were asked to assess thirst and hunger with a linear analogue scale of 0-10 (0 corresponding to no thirst or no hunger). After induction of anaesthesia, gastric contents were aspirated via a 16-French gauge orogastric tube. Gastric fluid volume (GV) was measured with a syringe and gastric pH (GpH) was assessed with Merck pH strips. GV, GpH and subject hunger were unaffected by ingestion of clear fluids. Subject thirst was reduced by clear fluids. It is concluded that unlimited clear fluid ingestion by healthy adolescents up to 3 h before operation decreases thirst and does not affect gastric contents.\r"

The mean steady state concentration of methohexitone required was 2.6 mg litre-1 (unbound 0.53 mg litre-1). The mean (SD) total clearance of methohexitone was 16.3 (4.2) ml min-1 kg-1, which is greater than that for volunteers or normal surgical patients. The unbound clearance correlated positively with body temperature during the infusion (r = 0.796, P = 0.017). The terminal half-life of methohexitone was 6.3 (3.8) h and that of the 4'-hydroxy metabolite 5.8 (2.1) h. There were no marked haemodynamic effects of the infusion, and no excessive sedation after the infusion. However, the clearance of methohexitone was high and variable, possibly as a direct effect of postoperative fever. Consequently, the need for individual titration of the rate of infusion is emphasized.\r"

Urinary porphyrin precursors and porphyrins were measured before operation and 1-5 days after operation. Stool and plasma porphyrin concentrations were measured over the same period. Comparison of these data in the porphyric patients and in 21 control subjects over the trial period revealed no significant change in porphyrin or porphyrin precursor output after operation. Urinary porphyrin precursor concentrations did not exceed the limits established for variegate porphyric patients in remission, and there were no changes in the stool and plasma porphyrin profiles or any symptoms of an acute porphyric attack.

  ".W": "We have studied the effect of i.v. anaesthesia with propofol in the emulsion (Intralipid) formulation on drug distribution and metabolism in six dogs using dual-route administration of propranolol as a model compound. Each dog was studied on two consecutive days: day 1 awake and day 2 during propofol anaesthesia (6 mg kg-1 followed by an infusion of 0.8 mg kg-1 min-1). Propofol anaesthesia was associated with reduced intrinsic clearance by 40% (P less than 0.05) but no significant difference in systemic clearance or hepatic plasma flow. Propofol produced marked changes in drug distribution; volume of distribution (Vss) of propranolol increased 54% from 82.5 (SEM 7.3) litre awake to 127.3 (27) litre during propofol anaesthesia (P less than 0.05). This change was accompanied by an increase (P less than 0.05) in the free fraction of propranolol from 8.5 (0.7) % in awake to 14.0 (0.7) % in propofol-anaesthetized dogs. The combination of the effects of both drug clearance and protein binding resulted in a 65% decrease in the intrinsic clearance of unbound drug (P less than 0.05). In contrast with the effects of propofol on drug distribution, infusion of Intralipid alone in another group of six dogs had no significant effects on drug distribution, protein binding or drug metabolism. We conclude that propofol is a modest inhibitor of drug metabolism, but has major effects on propranolol distribution, possibly by changing plasma protein binding.\r"

Crystalloid priming with Ringer lactate was compared with an albumin solution of nearly physiological colloid osmotic composition (4%). Measurements of extravascular lung water were performed by a modified, highly sensitive thermal dye technique, with additional detection of tracer signals in the pulmonary artery. In the Ringer lactate group, a significantly greater decrease in colloid osmotic pressure occurred immediately after onset of cardiopulmonary bypass. The more pronounced decrease in colloid osmotic pressure and in transcapillary gradient (difference between colloid osmotic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) in the Ringer lactate group was associated with a significant increase in extravascular lung water (by 60%) in the postoperative period; the human albumin group, however, showed only a slight tendency to increased lung water. There were no differences in haemodynamic or respiratory states after operation.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence from neuropsychological and psychophysical measurements that sensory information is processed in discrete time segments. The segmentation process may be described as neuronal oscillation at a frequency of 30-40 Hz. Stimulus-induced neuronal oscillations of this frequency are found in the middle latency range of the auditory evoked potential (AEP). We have studied the effect of different end-tidal concentrations of isoflurane on auditory evoked 30-40 Hz neuronal oscillations. We studied 13 patients undergoing intra-abdominal urological and gynaecological procedures. AEP were recorded in the awake state and during end-expiratory steady state isoflurane concentrations of 0.3, 0.6 and 1.2 vol%. These incremental doses of isoflurane caused a stepwise decrease in frequency of oscillations. The decrease in oscillation frequency and sometimes the disappearance of oscillatory components may be interpreted as suppression of sensory information processing. The measurement of auditory evoked neuronal oscillations in the AEP appears to be a promising tool to monitor both sensory information processing capacity and depth of anaesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "High pressure and anaesthetic agents are mutual antagonists in intact animals, but antagonism is not observed in isolated nerve cells. In order to test the hypothesis that a neural network might display pressure-anaesthetic antagonism not found in simpler systems, we have examined the effects of pentobarbitone at normal pressure and at 10.1 MPa helium pressure on the rhythmic activity of medullary respiratory centres of isolated brainstem and spinal cord from 0-3 day old rats. Pentobarbitone 5-80 mumol litre-1 depressed the frequency, amplitude and area of spontaneous bursts recorded from C5, reduced respiratory drive, and altered the response to trigeminal nerve root stimulation. Compression to 10.1 MPa decreased ventilatory frequency and respiratory drive, and either did not interact with or enhanced the depressant effects of pentobarbitone. Pentobarbitone and helium pressure altered the response to trigeminal nerve root stimulation in the same manner. The results are consistent with additive rather than antagonistic effects of pressure and a barbiturate on the determinants of output from the respiratory centre-motor neurone pathway. Pressure-anaesthetic antagonism may be a property unique to the neural circuitry which underlies awake behaviour and pressure-induced seizures, rather than reflecting a fundamental molecular-level antagonism.\r"

Early detection and biopsy of localized disease is crucial because early treatment provides an excellent prognosis. Surgical excision is the primary therapy for this disease. As the primary care provider for many women in the reproductive age group, obstetrician-gynecologists have an opportunity to detect these lesions at their earliest stages when they are amenable to cure. Overall, maternal metastases to the fetus and placenta are very rare events and do not warrant elective termination based on the maternal diagnosis. However, a thorough examination of the infant and placenta should be done in all cases of melanoma complicating pregnancy. After treatment, long-term follow-up is recommended. Since most recurrences develop within 3 years after the diagnosis, it remains prudent to recommend that these patients avoid a subsequent pregnancy during this interval.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma inhibitory factors, high levels of sex hormones, and depression of cell-mediated immunity may interfere with the natural host resistance to viral infections during pregnancy. It is apparent that hormonal, immunologic, and vascular changes in pregnancy may account for increased replication of herpes and for enhanced growth of condylomatous lesions. The challenge is to develop a rational plan of management for pregnant patients with herpes simplex or human papilloma virus infection. There has been a reevaluation of previous recommendations for the management of herpes in pregnancy. Although the consequences of neonatal infection are severe or fatal, the value of routine weekly screening is questionable. This regimen is a poor predictor of neonatal exposure to herpes since only one fourth of women shedding virus at the time of delivery can be identified by routine cultures. The mode of delivery should therefore be based on the presence or absence of lesions at the time of confinement. Cesarean section should be reserved for patients with lesions or with prodromal symptoms of recurrent disease at the time of delivery. Patients with ruptured membranes and active genital lesions should also be delivered by cesarean section. The spectrum of HPV-related diseases in pregnancy is poorly understood. Many questions remain unanswered. It may not be practical to treat very large or extensive genital warts during pregnancy. A cesarean section may be the best choice in these cases. It may be premature to recommend cesarean section for delivery of all pregnant women with symptomatic genital HPV infection. More data are needed. We recommend laser ablation of condylomatous lesions when discovered during pregnancy. Laser vaporization is associated with minimal morbidity when used by experienced surgeons. Trichloroacetic acid is excellent for minimal disease or for treatment of recurrences in pregnancy. Since the immune system seems to play an important role in control of viral disease, we advise pregnant patients to adopt a lifestyle which promotes health. We advise a balanced diet, an appropriate exercise program, and an environment free of unnecessary stress. We suggest avoidance of cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol.\r"

  ".W": "Noninvasive radiologic methods to detect paraaortic lymph node metastases are reliable when combined with FNA of enlarged lymph nodes. However, the sensitivity is low, and undetected microscopic metastases leads to treatment failure. These patients with paraaortic lymph node metastasis are not treated with extended-field radiation, and they all die within 3 years. The CT scanning is probably the best diagnostic method to evaluate cervical cancer, because it can assess the primary tumor, the urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, liver parenchyma, and retroperitoneum. It also permits the guidance of FNA and the arrangement of radiation ports. Surgical staging provides the direct assessment of the peritoneal cavity and the retroperitoneal spaces. Metastatic tumor, including enlarged lymph nodes, can be resected, but this is of dubious benefit. The operative morbidity is acceptable, with fewer intestinal complications when the extraperitoneal approach is used, and long-term morbidity is minimal when appropriate paraaortic radiation doses are employed (less than 5,000 cGy). Surgical staging has provided data on the frequency of paraaortic lymph node metastasis by stage of cervical cancer, and thus, treatment strategies can be better developed. Extended-field radiation results in 5-year survival rates of 20-25% in patients with microscopic paraaortic lymph node metastasis, patients who would not survive without the treatment. However, surgical staging has produced only a modest boost in survival rates, because of the high rate of pelvic and systemic failure. When extended-field radiation is used prophylactically or in patients with probable lymph node metastasis seen on radiographic studies, survival rates are similar to patients irradiated after surgical staging finds paraaortic lymph node disease. As our ability to predict, and detect nonsurgically, positive paraaortic node disease improves, extended radiation (or other adjuvant therapy) could be used more frequently without operation in patients who are at high risk for metastatic disease. In a study by Haie et al, prophylactic paraaortic radiation was given to patients at high risk for paraaortic metastasis. In patients with a high probability of local disease control, paraaortic radiation significantly reduced the incidence of paraaortic and distant metastases. Patients with known paraaortic lymph node metastases frequently have occult systemic metastases. In these same patients, pelvic failure is also common. Thus, until effective systemic therapies emerge, a marked improvement in survival is unlikely in patients who have paraaortic lymph node metastasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The benefits of surgery include: 1) emotional satisfaction that the tumor has been removed, 2) accuracy of surgical staging, 3) preservation of the ovaries, 4) no secondary uterine cancer (a very uncommon problem), and 5) complications that are more readily correctable. Radiation offers the major advantages of being useful in most patients regardless of age or medical condition and is the choice for large cancers. Because stage IB cervical cancer is a very diverse pathological entity with a number of potential prognostic factors (including cell type, depth of invasion, tumor volume, lymphatic space involvement, and occult lymph node metastases), and because patients present with a number of other conditions (including excess weight, advanced age, prior pelvic surgery or infection, and severe medical illness), we are fortunate to have two good methods for treating cervical cancer. Prospective randomized studies will be necessary in the future to better define specific advantages in the various clinical settings. But, in general, the following have proven most expedient: 1) class I hysterectomy, for microinvasive cancer of 3 mm invasion or less without lymphatic space involvement, 2) modified, extended hysterectomy (class II) and pelvic lymphadenectomy for lesions of 3 mm and lymph vascular space involvement or when the lesion seems to just exceed 3 mm and for very early adenocarcinoma, 3) an extended hysterectomy (class III) and pelvic lymphadenectomy for larger IA2, IB, and IIA lesions that are less than 4 cm, particularly for the pregnant or younger patient, and when ovarian conservation is desired, 4) radiation therapy is used for lesions over 4 cm and for women with severe medical illness making extended hysterectomy too hazardous, 5) combination therapy and chemotherapy are now reserved for study in poor prognosis patients with very large lesions (greater than 6 cm), occult metastases, and unfavorable histologic criteria (Table 2).\r"

A preinjection arthrogram was performed to ensure correct placement of the needle. Plaster of paris cast immobilization of the joint was used for three days. After a mean follow-up period of seven years (range, two to 12 years), 47 joints were pain free, and 13 joints had not experienced another hemorrhagic episode. The mean hemorrhagic frequency had decreased from four per month to two per year. The radiation risk was far outweighed by the benefits of the procedure. Forty-seven of the 58 joints were rated as improved by the patients. The roentgenographic appearance of the joints had changed little. Only five complications occurred: three needle-track necroses because of extravasation of the radiocolloid, two severely painful joints immediately after injection, and one massive hemorrhagic episode. This form of treatment is suggested for hemophiliacs who have failed to respond to intensive physical and hematologic therapy, and for those patients who have inhibitors.\r"

The functional results after surgery were evaluated according to the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score. In all diaphyseal resections and resections of the upper extremity and pelvis, the results were excellent or good in 60% of the cases. In resections of the proximal femur, distal femur, or proximal tibia and reconstruction with nonexpansible prostheses, the results were excellent or good in 75%. On the other hand, when arthrodeses of the lower extremity were used, only 14% of cases had a good result. This correlates with the resulting lack of articulation and serious limb shortening seen with progression of skeletal growth.\r"

If symptoms develop, they are usually due to cervical instability or degenerative osteoarthrosis. Recent information indicates that patients with upper cervical anomalies such as atlantooccipital fusion, anomalies of the odontoid, or the transverse atlantal ligament have a great propensity to develop early instability and neurologic problems secondary to minor traumatic events. If symptoms occurs in the lower cervical spine, it is usually in adult life and due to degenerative arthritis in the hypermobile articulations adjacent to the area of synostosis. The relatively good prognosis of cervical lesions is overshadowed by the \"hidden\" or unrecognized associated anomalies. There is a high incidence of significant scoliosis, Sprengel's deformity, renal anomalies, deafness, and neurologic malformations. Early recognition and treatment of these problems may be of substantial benefit, sparing the patient further deformity or serious illness.\r"

These patients were compared with 26 patients who had only osteoarthrosis of the spine and 27 who had only vertebral collapse. The patients who had both spinal osteoporosis and osteoarthrosis were older, more advanced in menopause, and physically smaller in stature and body weight than the other groups. They also had higher serum parathyroid hormone level, used nonthiazide diuretics more frequently, and had more nulliparity than the other two groups. These patients had osteoarthrosis of the hip to a lesser degree than patients affected by osteoarthrosis alone, and they had fewer fractures of the forearm and other sites than patients with osteoporosis alone. The incidence of femoral neck fractures in both groups, however, was comparable. These results suggest that osteoarthrosis or a related factor might have a protective effect on the progression of osteoporosis. These results confirm earlier observations that postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoarthrosis are two distinct diseases and not the result of normal aging.\r"

Fifty-one patients were placed randomly into two controlled passive-motion protocols. Group 1 patients received greater intervals of passive-motion rehabilitation using a continuous passive-motion device. Group 2 patients were treated with a traditional early passive-motion protocol for tendon rehabilitation. For Group 1 patients, the mean interval of controlled motion rehabilitation was 75 hours a week, and the mean number of cycles was 12,000. For Group 2 patients the mean interval of controlled passive motion was four hours a week, and the mean number of cycles was 1000. The minimum follow-up time was six months (mean, 10.8 months). Using Strickland and Glogovac's formula, the mean active motion for digits in Group 1 was 138 degrees +/- 6 degrees. Mean motion for tendons in Group 2 was 119 degrees +/- 8 degrees. The difference between Groups 1 and 2 was statistically significant. The effect of the number of tendons injured per digit within each group was not significant. The data from this experiment indicate that the duration of the daily controlled motion interval is a significant variable insofar as postrepair flexor tendon function is concerned.\r"

Seventy-eight patients were evaluated for complications resulting from hypothermia and prolonged tourniquet application. The duration of continuous tourniquet ischemia averaged two hours and 25 minutes. Intraoperative muscle temperature recordings indicated that the iced limbs were an average of 12.9 degrees cooler than noniced limbs before tourniquet inflation. Electron microscopic studies of biopsied muscle showed no evidence of ischemic changes. There were no postoperative complications associated with prolonged tourniquet inflation or the hypothermia blanket technique. Local hypothermia appears to be a safe and effective method of decreasing the adverse effects of tourniquet ischemia and allowing continuous tourniquet inflation time to extend safely beyond the customary two-hour limit.\r"

Bone ingrowth was present in ten of the 21 cases. A 38% incidence of removal for persistent pain was present in cases with an inflammatory infiltrate. Seventeen of 87 patients (20%) with cobalt-chromium devices and four of ten patients (40%) with titanium devices were identified as having an inflammatory infiltrate. The origin of the inflammatory infiltrate is unclear. All patients with inflammatory infiltrates had noninfected implants, which were not loose roentgenographically or clinically at the time of removal. Hypersensitivity and allergic responses to metal ions may produce such infiltrates. It is impossible, however, in the present study to definitively determine the etiology of the infiltrates.\r"

In the 48-hour group, 85% of the total volume was drained during the first 24 hours. During the following 24-hour period, a mean volume of only 50 ml was drained. No organism was isolated from cultures of drain tips sampled at 24 hours. However, at 48 hours, 25% of the drain tips yielded light growths of coagulase-negative staphylococci (four drain tips) and Staphylococcus aureus (one drain tip). Clinical evaluations of wound healing were comparable in the two groups. Clearly, nothing is to be gained by continuing drainage beyond 24 hours. If drainage is maintained for longer periods, there is an increased risk of contamination by bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were evaluated in 22 patients who had had a patellectomy. Fourteen knees (12 patients) had a primary TKA, and 12 patients had a revision TKA. Two patients in the revision group, whose prostheses failed, were from the primary TKA group. The mean follow-up time was 8.5 years in the primary TKA group and 7.6 years in the revision TKA group. A group of 14 control knees with patellae was randomly generated but matched for prosthesis, diagnosis, surgeon, age, and time of surgery. This group was similarly evaluated with an average follow-up time of 6.9 years. The primary TKA group had seven knees that were rated as good or excellent, two as fair, and three as poor. The control group had a significantly higher average rating than the primary TKA group. In this group, there were 12 good or excellent knees, three fair, and none poor. Postoperative pain, flexion contracture, extension lag, and range of motion all contributed significant information to the final score, whereas other variables (walking, function, strength, and instability) did not contribute any additional information. Although higher overall scores may have been expected if the patients had patellae, the results during the follow-up examination were satisfactory and justified TKA in these patients. In general, however, patients without patellae may be at a higher risk for failure of the prosthesis, as seen in five patients having primary TKA and another ten patients with failed TKA requiring revision.\r"

They were randomized to three treatment groups: (1) repair and augmentation of the ACL with an iliotibial strip, (2) repair without augmentation, and (3) nonsurgical ACL treatment. Associated injuries of menisci and other ligaments were treated in the same way for the three groups. Two-thirds of the patients in the nonsurgically treated group complained of instability and 17% had had a subsequent reconstruction of the ACL at the follow-up examination. The group treated with an augmented repair had a less abnormal laxity measured by a laxity-testing device. Sixty-three percent returned to competitive sports, as compared with 27% in the nonsurgical group and 32% in the only repair group. Relative strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles were similar for all groups. The augmented-repair group had better hop tests, reflecting a superior stability, whereas running was not affected by treatment but was correlated with the activity level.\r"

Ia refers to molecules on the cell surface belonging to Class II of the major histocompatibility complex and is specific for the species and the individual. In both types of granulation tissues (fracture healing and following DBP implantation), the mesenchymal cells from the surrounding musculature were accompanied by large numbers of Ia-positive cells and common macrophages. The occurrence of IL-2 receptors was sparse in fracture healing but rich in DBP induction, probably because of its immunogenic properties, though weak. On Day 7, almost all existing cells in DBP induction were Ia-positive, signifying an immunologic effector phase apparently directed to the remaining still-passive bone powder in the periphery, while the central part of the inserted bone powder was producing cartilaginous cells and matrix. The presence of accessory immunologic cells in fracture healing is perhaps due to a surveillance function (a standard response on injury), but the cell differentiation might also be dependent on the active mediators emitted from Ia-positive cells and macrophages. This investigation strengthens the concept that induced bone development occurs in experimental fracture healing.\r"

Cantilever-bending tests to failure were conducted on the proximal femur, and fracture-surface cross sections were analyzed. Morphologically, the femoral necks in diabetic rats decreased in the relative size of their cortical shell and increased their trabecular core. Structurally, the load and the energy at the proportional limit and the total energy in diabetic femoral necks were significantly less than controls. In material properties, the diabetic femoral necks had significantly less stress at the proportional limit. Compared to the DM group, the DI femoral necks had significantly greater load and energy at the proportional limit and significantly greater total energy. Femoral neck mechanical and morphologic properties in diabetic rats were significantly lower than controls, but insulin treatment ameliorated diabetic osteopathy in the rat femoral neck.\r"

Focal areas with deposition of CPPD crystals in each tissue showed electron-dense precipitates of the antimony-calcium complex: (1) in the cytoplasm of hypertrophic chondrocytes around CPPD crystals, especially on the margins of intracellular lipid droplets or within electron-dense amorphous material or both; and (2) on the margins of lipid droplets and within electron-dense amorphous material in the degenerated matrix surrounding the hypertrophic chondrocytes. The slender rodlike structures consisting of electron-dense precipitates of the antimony-calcium complex, suggestive of the precursor to rodlike CPPD crystals, were also observed in the degenerated matrix. These findings suggest that the hypertrophic chondrocytes may contribute to the formation of CPPD crystals by intracellular accumulation of calcium and subsequent release of high concentration of calcium into their surrounding matrix.\r"

Three corresponding groups of control rats were injected with saline. In Group 1, maximum load and stiffness of the healing fractures increased to 165% and 175%, respectively, compared to the control group. In Group 2, maximum load, stiffness, maximum stress, and energy absorption at maximum load increased to 222%, 175%, 171%, and 247%, respectively, compared to the control group.

Vancomycin and daptomycin are effective against nearly all staphylococci and streptococci, and amikacin has a broader spectrum against gram-negative bacilli than do other aminoglycosides such as gentamicin. These three antibiotics maintained bioactivity after incorporation into several commonly used preparations of PMMA and eluted readily into the surrounding medium. Preparing PMMA under negative atmospheric pressure, which decreases porosity, caused a 50% reduction in antibiotic release; the addition of 25% dextran, which increases porosity, greatly facilitated elution of these antibiotics. Based on their broad antibacterial effect against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, inclusion of vancomycin and amikacin in PMMA merits clinical study. The addition of these antibiotics to PMMA, together with dextran, may be applicable when structural integrity is unimportant but a substantial local antimicrobial effect is desired, such as in the use of antibiotic-containing beads to treat osteomyelitis.\r"

It includes chronic osteomyelitis as a sequel to late acute osteomyelitis as well as chronic unifocal and chronic multifocal osteomyelitis. Whereas Staphylococcus aureus and other pyogenic organisms are commonly cultured from chronic lesions following late acute osteomyelitis, they are less frequently cultured from those with chronic unifocal osteomyelitis and rarely cultured from those with chronic multifocal osteomyelitis. The methods of treatment and the results also differ between these subgroups of nonspecific osteomyelitis. Lesions following late acute osteomyelitis are usually cured following surgery and antibiotics. Chronic unifocal osteomyelitis is usually cured with antibiotics only or with surgery and antibiotics. In contrast, surgery and antibiotics are largely ineffective in children with chronic multifocal osteomyelitis, but the disease appears to be self-limiting.\r"

Experience has confirmed the need for careful selection of the vertebrae to be instrumented, the value of anterior release for rigid curves in imparting convertibility of the deformity, and the importance of careful fusion techniques. During the last decade, further development has occurred because of an increased knowledge of the biomechanical needs for the internally instrumented spine and a three-dimensional appreciation of the scoliotic curve. Biomechanical advances have centered on an understanding of the load-sharing properties afforded by the multiple spinal purchase sites (segmental spinal instrumentation) and the value of two-rod systems linked by couplers. These advances have provided an increased stiffness of the instrumental spine, a reduction in correction loss, improved fatigue properties of the implant, and fewer pseudarthroses. The most important advance of the last decade is an improved awareness of the three-dimensional approach to the scoliotic deformity with the need to preserve or improve sagittal contours. In particular, the importance of the loss of normal thoracic kyphosis or lumbar lordosis has been emphasized. These conceptual gains have led to the development of many new instrument systems to correct deformity. Each is associated with advantages, problems, and risks that must be understood to make intelligent choices for treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Asthma is one of the most common respiratory problems in modern industrialized countries, affecting over 5% of the population. It affects all age groups from infants to senior citizens, and mortality rates from asthma appear to be increasing during the past few years in the United States as well as in other industrialized countries. Asthma tends to occur in families, associated with other allergic disease, and may be induced by a wide variety of environmental antigens, most commonly inhaled allergens such as pollen and dust. Bronchial challenge with a specific allergen results in an early bronchospastic response with a relatively brief duration, and in a significant number of patients there is a late response with onset after 3 to 4 hours, lasting hours to days. This late response is associated with a bronchial hypersensitivity reaction, which is demonstrable by nonspecific challenge testing in the laboratory. During the period of bronchial hyperresponsiveness patients are prone to develop attacks following exposure to a wide variety of \"triggers,\" including cold air, fumes, or cigarette smoke. The current approach to management of patients with asthma emphasizes prevention, with avoidance of specific allergens when possible, and chronic use of anti-inflammatory agents including corticosteroids and cromolyn sodium. The goal is to decrease the bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Management of the acute asthma attack consists of bronchodilator therapy, primarily with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, and administration of oral or systemic corticosteroids if the attack is not rapidly relieved. Additional therapeutic agents including theophylline and anticholinergics may be useful in some situations. Response to therapy during the first couple of hours in the emergency room is the most important predictor of the course of the acute attack, and patients who have not responded significantly after 2 hours of maximum therapy are candidates for hospital admission or prolonged emergency room observation. The goal of acute therapy is to wean the patient from intravenous drugs and place him or her on rapidly tapering doses of oral prednisone while initiating a vigorous program of preventive therapy. Follow-up observation, both in the office and in the patient's home, is vital and involves extensive patient education and objective testing of peak airflow. In general, the course of asthma is relatively benign compared with other obstructive airway diseases; however, significant mortality exists, especially in older patients and those with late-onset asthma.\r"

  ".W": "A search of the records of one general practice, serving 5282 patients, generated a list of 72 patients (1.36%) who had been using a benzodiazepine tranquillizer continuously for more than 6 months. These patients were interviewed and asked to discontinue the use of these drugs with the help of their general practitioner. An individual approach for each patient was agreed between the general practitioner and the patient. Patients who initially did not agree to try to stop the drug were included in the study. After 1 year, 27 (37.5%) of the patients had stopped using the benzodiazepine completely and 24 (33.3%) had reduced their previous consumption by more than 50%. This outcome was independent of sex, age, drug used, duration of use, whether they were exceeding the original dose of the drug and attendance at a consultant psychiatric clinic. It was significantly more likely that the patient would stop taking the drug if they originally wished to do so, but several of those who initially did not want to try to stop were able to do this. The excess number of consultations for the patients in the study for the year of the study compared with the year before the study only constituted 0.35% of the total number of consultations in the practice. The results were better than expected and the exercise was felt to be worthwhile, particularly as the increase in workload was very small.\r"

  ".W": "Insomnia is a common symptom in family practice, and hypnotics are frequently prescribed for its treatment. A survey was performed in an urban clinic serving 1900 persons in order to detect the prevalence of this disorder and to reassess the need for hypnotics. Sixty-one patients were identified who were taking prescribed hypnotic drugs, mainly benzodiazepines. All were over the age of 40, and they comprised 8.1% of this age group. Forty-five were chronic users, taking hypnotics for more than 4 months during a 6-month study period. Eighty-nine percent of these chronic users were above 60 years of age. Seventy-seven percent had difficulty initiating sleep and 23% had problems maintaining sleep. Information was given to these patients on the side effects and possible addictive nature of chronic hypnotic use. Different kinds of psychological support were offered as alternatives to drug treatment, but these were refused by all. We conclude that in view of the addiction associated with chronic use and the difficulty of weaning patients off the sleeping pill, there is a place for more careful evaluation and management before hypnotics are prescribed.\r"

Measure of the socio-economic status was based on the family income, since in Saudi Arabia this is the most potent indicator which affects living standards. The results indicate that there is a direct correlationship between family income and birth weight (P less than 0.001, chi 2 test).\r"

The feasibility of the programme was investigated and the results after 1 year were compared with those of conventional care in four control practices. In the experimental practices, 13 patients switched from a medical specialist's to a general practitioner's supervision, 20 remained under supervision of their GP and 33 started self-monitoring. The self-monitoring rate, the consultation frequency according to protocol, the low number of dropouts and inadequate referrals and adherence to the therapeutic scheme showed that the protocol was feasible for both the GPs and the patients. At the initial assessment, the regulation of the diabetes was worse in patients of the experimental group, compared with those of the control group (mean HbA1 9.7% vs 8.9%; p less than 0.05). On average, patients in the experimental group (n = 56) lost 0.4 kg of body weight, whereas those in the control group (n = 73) gained 0.1 kg (n.s.). The mean change in HbA1, adjusted for the initial value, was -0.4% in the experimental and +0.5% in the control group (p less than 0.05). The results of the protocol can be attributed to a combination of greater participation of the patient, the individualized consultation frequency and the prescription of oral hypoglycaemic agents according to body weight development.\r"

Over one year, 254 consecutive patients who consulted their GP for chronic abdominal pain were asked to answer a guided questionnaire. A checklist of simple parameters suggestive of the presence of organic diseases of the colon was also registered by the GP. For the final diagnosis, the patients underwent either a colonoscopy or a barium enema. Data collected were analysed by means of a stepwise logistic regression analysis to obtain a weighted score for the diagnosis of either irritable bowel syndrome (score less than 0) or organic disease (score greater than 0). Out of the 25 parameters explored, six were significantly more common among patients with organic disease and weighted as positive score (namely ESR greater than 17 mm, first hour, history of blood in the stool, leukocytosis greater than 10,000 cm3, age greater than 45 years, slight fever and presence of neoplastic colonic diseases in first-degree relatives). On the contrary, five parameters were more frequent among patients with irritable bowel syndrome and weighted as negative score (namely visible distension of the abdomen, feeling of distension, presence of irritable bowel syndrome in first degree relatives, flatulence and irregularities of bowel movement). Our scoring system correctly classified 83.5% of the cases, and it was very sensitive (82.4%) for the diagnosis of organic disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Outcome is confined to average effects which can be generalized to the specific population, but which do not necessarily apply to individual persons. In single subject trials the experimental unit is a treatment period and each treatment period is randomly allocated in a multiple cross-over sequence of periods. The single subject is only representative of itself, but similar responses in corresponding single subject trials may justify careful extrapolation of the results. Single subject trials have a high risk of Type II errors. However, the randomization procedure chosen and the type of statistical test applied may enhance the statistical power of such trials. Internal validity depends on modeling the trial design to the clinical features, drug properties and statistical requirements, while reliability is determined by the reproducibility of the trial response.\r"

The mean pre-dialysis serum level of B2M was 23.4 +/- 11.1 mg/L (nl less than 3 mg/L). There was no significant effect of hemodialysis with any dialysate/dialyzer combination on intradialytic serum B2M levels. Five patients had detectable pre-dialysis serum levels of TNF alpha (greater than 40 pg/ml) at least once and 2 had detectable levels prior to all dialyses. Six patients had detectable pre-dialysis serum levels of IL1-B (greater than 20 pg/ml) at least once, and 2 had detectable levels prior to all dialyses. Serum TNF alpha, IL1-B and B2M levels were not significantly correlated with one another. Our data do not support the hypothesis that blood-membrane interactions significantly affect circulating levels of TNF alpha, IL1-B or B2M. Chronic high level elevations of plasma IL1-B and TNF alpha are not uniformly observed in hemodialysis patients, arguing against a role for these substances as systemic uremic toxins.\r"

A two-compartment model appeared to be the simplest kinetic model to explain the shifts in proton concentrations in extra- and intra-cellular media. Non-linear regression was used to determine exchange constant values. There was a very good correlation between the experimental and calculated proton concentrations. This model can describe all patients but individual experimental constants must be determined. Under these conditions a single blood pH determination before dialysis will permit determination of the initial intra-erythrocytic pH and monitoring of intra-erythrocytic pH during hemodialysis.\r"

In the dialysers containing ethylene vinyl acetate (EVAL) or Cellulate the number of particles recovered were within the 95% range of the particles in the rinsing fluid and did not alter with increasing rinsing volume. In the dialysers containing Cuprophan and Hemophan the initial particle numbers were higher but fell rapidly up to a 450 ml rinse volume; increasing the rinse volume to 1050 ml did not alter particle recovery.

In the unsuccessful cases, the angle formed between the axes of the stenosed portion and the normal vessel was over 39 degrees, and the distance between the anastomosis and the stenosed portion was less than 11 mm.\r"

The objectives have been to identify both good (e.g. short residence times) and bad (e.g. high turbulence levels) flow characteristics. The flow was visualised using polystyrene micro-spheres illuminated with white light on selected transverse planes across the pumping chamber and its inlet and outlet connections. These results then served as a guide for velocity measurements using laser-Doppler anemometry. Flow tests were run using water or a water/glycerol mixture. Operating conditions were determined from the appropriate fluid mechanics modelling laws to ensure dynamical similarity. Initially, steady flow behaviour was investigated including the effects of removal and insertion of the tilting-disc inlet and outlet valves. In subsequent full pumping tests, using a pneumatic driver, regions of high shear, separation, and high turbulence intensity have been identified.\r"

The pressure sensitive surface of the piezoresistive effect absolute pressure sensor was coated with a thrombo-resistant polymer, as was the inner surface of the cannulae of the VAD. In the in vitro and chronic animal experiments which were of more than a month duration, reliable stability and sensitivity, without any thrombus formation on the blood contacting surface of the sensors, and high sensitivity were observed. After chronic experiments, the sensitivity of sensors was reevaluated in the mock circulatory system as compared to reference values. The relationship between the output of the micro-sensors and the reference value was linear and correlated well.\r"

Treatment for CVP was effective, as compared with two groups of 5 calves each not treated in this way, and it is assumed to be an important factor for prolongation of survival. Mineralization of driving diaphragms was present in all these calves. No preventive measures of this pathologic change were performed in this group. Another complication is hemolysis, which is partly caused by immune mechanisms initiated by administration of alpha-methyl dopa and partly by mechanical destruction due to a heavily mineralized driving diaphragm. The prevention of mineralization is another important problem for future research. Other problems, concerning the survival of TAH recipients are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Inhaled glucocorticosteroids have been developed for the treatment of asthma in an attempt to minimize the suppression of endogenous adrenal function that complicates oral or injected steroid usage, but it is unclear whether this strategy leads to reduced systemic complications in other areas, such as the skeleton. In this study we evaluated serum osteocalcin levels as a marker of skeletal metabolism in healthy volunteers treated with oral and inhaled steroids alone and in response to an oral calcitriol stimulation test. Forty subjects, aged 33 +/- 9 (mean +/- SD) yr were randomized to receive either high or low dose oral prednisolone (40 vs. 10 mg/day) or inhaled budesonide (3.2 vs. 0.8 mg/day). Each dose of budesonide is known to have a greater antiasthmatic potency than the dose of prednisolone with which it was compared. In addition 10 control subjects received placebos containing no active steroid drugs. During the second week of treatment, half of the subjects in each of the 4 steroid-treated groups and all subjects in the control group received oral calcitriol (2.0 micrograms/day). There was a marked dose-dependent reduction in serum cortisol levels, but this reduction was significantly less pronounced during budesonide treatment, such that low dose budesonide was without effect. During the first week of steroid therapy there were significant dose-dependent reductions in serum osteocalcin (P = 0.003), but this reduction was not significantly different between budesonide and prednisolone treatments. In response to calcitriol, serum osteocalcin increased by 35% in the control group (P = 0.06). Osteocalcin levels increased by 56% and 50% in the low dose budesonide and prednisolone groups and by 106% in the high dose budesonide group, but did not change in the high dose prednisolone group. The osteocalcin response to calcitriol was significantly higher in the budesonide groups (P = 0.03, by analysis of variance). High dose prednisolone caused increases in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (P less than 0.02), urinary calcium excretion (P = 0.07), and urinary hydroxyproline (P less than 0.01). None of these changes was seen during budesonide therapy. There are as yet no data for these variables after long term use of inhaled budesonide in asthmatic patients, but our acute studies suggest that this potent topical glucocorticoid may have considerably less impact on the skeleton than oral prednisolone, even if used at doses high enough to suppress endogenous adrenal function.\r"

  ".U": "91147523\r", 
  ".W": "The cause of hypercalcemia in familial benign hypercalcemia (FBH; also called familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia) is unclear, although it is PTH dependent. It is also uncertain how plasma PTH levels are related to the severity of biochemical abnormalities in FBH. Because the PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) has many PTH-like actions, it might have a role in the hypercalcemia of FBH. Thus, we studied 29 patients with FBH from 11 families, 29 age- and sex-matched controls, and 42 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (1 degree HPT), measuring PTH with a highly sensitive two-site immunochemiluminometric assay and the hypercalcemic tumor factor PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) with an extraction/concentration RIA. Plasma PTH values were elevated in 86% of 1 degree HPT patients (36 of 42), but in only 20% of FBH patients, (6 of 29). Plasma PTHrP was elevated in 1 FBH patient, and the group mean value was normal. Plasma PTH was positively correlated with calcium (Ca) in 1 degree HPT (r = 0.66; P less than 0.0001) and in FBH (r = 0.53; P less than 0.004), but the slopes of the regressions were markedly different: 1 degree HPT, 6.72; FBH, 1.61 (P less than 0.0001). There was a negative correlation between PTH and phosphorus (P) in 1 degree HPT (r = -0.39; P less than 0.01) and in FBH (r = -0.41; P less than 0.03), but, again, the slopes differed greatly: 1 degree HPT, -6.57; FBH, -1.95 (P less than 0.0001). There were no correlations between PTHrP and Ca or between PTH and PTHrP. The sums and products of PTH and PTHrP were not better correlated with Ca than PTH alone. Thus, PTH values are lower at given Ca and P levels in patients with FBH than in those with 1 degree HPT, suggesting that PTH is more effective in raising Ca and lowering P in FBH than in 1 degree HPT. The enigma of FBH remains: what molecular defect can simultaneously cause parathyroid cell insensitivity to Ca, enhanced renal tubular reabsorption of Ca, increased renal rejection of P, and enhanced or retained sensitivity to PTH?\r"

We determined the serum potassium and sodium concentrations, plasma prostaglandin E2 level, PRA, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and aldosterone level from 20 min before to 120 min after administration of captopril. DXM pretreatment stimulated the PRA response to captopril. This stimulation was suppressed by indomethacin. However, the administration of DXM did not induce a consistent rise in the prostaglandin E2 level. The administration of DXM induced a significant rise in the potassium concentration, but since simultaneous administration of indomethacin with captopril induced the suppression of PRA without affecting the potassium level, the PRA increase in response to captopril with DXM was not caused directly by the potassium increase. There were no significant differences in the PRA increase between 25 mg captopril and 75 mg captopril, or between DXM-25 mg captopril and DXM-75 mg captopril, though the inhibitions of ACE activity by captopril differed according to dose. The PRA increases, but not the captopril-induced inhibition of ACE activity, were significantly different between captopril alone and captopril with DXM pretreatment at either dose of captopril. Thus, the inhibition of ACE activity perhaps allows PRA to increase in response to captopril. These results suggest that the DXM stimulation of PRA may have been dependent on the inhibition of ACE activity by captopril.\r"

The deficiency caused maternal virilization during pregnancy and pseudohermaphroditism of the female fetus. A 24-yr-old primigravida showed progressive virilization during the third trimester. Urinary excretion of estrogen was less than 14 mumol/day between 35-38 weeks of pregnancy, although nonstress tests showed reactive patterns and serum levels of human placental lactogen were above 460 nmol/L. Maternal serum levels of estrogens were low, and those of androgens were high in the third trimester. A dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate loading test induced a marked increase in maternal serum levels of androgens, whereas no such increase was observed in estrogens. The woman delivered vaginally a live full-term infant who exhibited female pseudohermaphroditism. Cord serum levels of estrogens were extremely low, while those of androgens were high. The aromatase activity of the placenta, determined by the conversion of [7-3H]androstenedione to 17 beta-[7-3H]estradiol and [7-3H]estrone, were less than 0.03 fmol/microgram protein.min (control, 9.6 +/- 2.2 fmol/microgram protein.min). The sulfatase activity of the placenta was 0.63 pmol/microgram protein.min compared to 0.46 +/- 0.16 pmol/microgram protein.min in controls. The rate of aromatization by normal control placentas was the same as that obtained during coincubation of samples of normal placentas and that of the patient. Thus, the presence of aromatase inhibitor in the patient's placenta was excluded.\r"

  ".W": "The adrenal gland requires a continuous supply of cholesterol for the biosynthesis of adrenal corticosteroids, which can be supplied by low density lipoprotein receptor-mediated uptake or local synthesis. The present study examined whether hypolipidemic therapy with a potent HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, compromises the adrenal response to ACTH stimulation in adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The adrenal response to a 36-h continuous ACTH infusion was determined at baseline and after 2 months of simvastatin treatment (40 mg, twice daily) in eight patients. Simvastatin reduced total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 36% and 45%, respectively. The time course of the increase in serum cortisol concentrations with continuous ACTH infusion was the same before and during simvastatin therapy, as were the rates of urinary excretion of free cortisol, 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, and 17-ketosteroids. Urinary excretion of mevalonate, which correlates with rates of whole body cholesterol synthesis, decreased from 3.8 +/- 0.42 (+/- SEM) mu,ol/24 h at baseline to 2.75 +/- 0.56 on simvastatin; no significant changes were seen in the urinary mevalonate levels before and after simvastatin therapy during ACTH stimulation. We conclude that the hypolipidemic effects of simvastatin in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia are paralleled by a decrease in urinary mevalonate, but that the drug does not adversely affect ACTH-stimulated adrenal corticosteroid production.\r"

Serum cortisol and urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids were suppressed by dexamethasone in 39 patients [DST(+)]. In two patients (cases A and B), they were not suppressed [DST(-)]. Clinical manifestations of the two DST(-) patients were similar to those of DST(+) patients. Hypertension, hypokalemia, high serum aldosterone levels, and suppressed PRA were found in all of the patients. The cut surfaces of the adenomas from all of the patients, including cases A and B, were golden yellow, which is typical of APA. However, atrophies of the adjacent normal tissues were evident exclusively in the two DST(-) patients. After removal of the affected adrenals, the serum cortisol level was suppressed by dexamethasone in one of the DST(-) patients (case B). These findings suggested autonomous cortisol production by APA. To evaluate whether cortisol could be produced from the adenoma tissue, the presence of several steroidogenic enzymes was studied by immunohistochemistry and mRNA analysis in the adenomas and the adjacent nonneoplastic adrenals from the 2 DST(-) and 5 DST(+) patients. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that steroidogenic enzymes were expressed in APA tumor tissues from both DST(-) and DST(+) patients. In both groups, mRNAs coding steroidogenic enzymes were present not only in the nonneoplastic but also in the tumor tissues. Quantitative analysis of the mRNA levels revealed that in the adrenals from DST(+) patients, the mRNAs were more abundant in nonneoplastic tissue than in tumor tissue. However, in those from DST(-) cases, the mRNAs were much more abundant in the tumor tissues than in the nonneoplastic tissues. These results indicate that tumor cells of the two DST(-) patients autonomously synthesized not only aldosterone but also cortisol. The diameters of the tumors from the two DST(-) patients exceeded 3 cm, while those from other DST(+) patients were smaller. In patients with large APA, adrenal insufficiency should be anticipated upon removal of the tumor.\r"

  ".W": "Virtually all circulating insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) are bound to specific binding proteins (IGFBP), of which IGFBP-3 is the quantitatively most important. The mechanisms regulating the close coordination between serum levels of IGFs and IGFBP-3 is poorly understood. We therefore evaluated the temporal association of serum IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 measured by RIAs after well defined short-term GH exposure in GH-deficient patients. Six patients (mean +/- SE age: 20.5 +/- 1.1 yr) each underwent three GH study protocols in random order. Each study was preceded by 4 weeks without GH therapy. Two units of GH were administered iv as either: 1) two boluses, 2) eight boluses, or 3) a constant infusion. The duration of each study was 44 h including at least 16 h after termination of GH administration. Increments in serum IGF-I occurred 4-6 h after initiated GH exposure in all studies. In the two-bolus study the IGF-I increase was modest with mean +/- SE peak values of 12.4 +/- 2.1 nmol x L-1 after GH administration. In the eight bolus and constant infusion studies significantly higher IGF-I levels were generated: 17.0 +/- 2.2 nmol x L-1 (8 bolus) and 18.8 +/- 1.1 h nmol x L-1 (infusion). In contrast the time course change in serum IGF-II did not differ in the three studies, and it was characterised by a sluggish increase of approximately 30% evidenced after 16-20 h. The changes in IGFBP-3 were almost identical in the three studies. After a lag phase of approximately 18-20 h a gradual increase of approximately 40%, which had not ceased at the end of the study period, was observed. The molar ratio of serum IGF-I plus IGF-II:serum IGFBP-3 remained constant with values between 0.8-0.9 except in the constant infusion experiment, in which the ratio increased significantly with time reaching a mean peak value, which exceeded 1.0, after 24 h. Our data suggest that a pulsatile GH pattern is not superior to constant GH levels as regards generation of IGFs and IGFBP. The earlier increase in serum IGF-I compared to IGF-II and IGFBP-3 suggests that IGF-I may be the main regulator of IGFBP-3 production. Accordingly, the slow increase in serum IGF-II, which paralleled that of IGFBP-3, could indicate that serum IGF-II levels mainly depend on the concentration or binding site availability of IGFBP-3.\r"

Mean EGF/Cr levels in male infants were similar to term values beginning at 32-34 weeks. We could not demonstrate any influence from acute perinatal events on EGF/Cr levels. In a subset of 28 infants, a weekly longitudinal study of urinary EGF/Cr levels was undertaken. The urinary EGF/Cr pattern correlated significantly with both corrected gestational and postnatal ages. A significant change in the EGF/Cr pattern was observed at a corrected gestational age of 32 weeks and at 4 weeks postnatal age. There was no significant difference in EGF/Cr levels between males and females. Our results demonstrated a significant difference in first day urinary EGF/Cr levels between female and male preterm infants during the early third trimester. This difference was seen at a time in gestation when other gender-specific maturational and growth differences are noted. When infants born at less than 32 weeks gestational age were followed longitudinally, the urinary EGF/Cr pattern, when expressed by corrected gestational age, was significantly modified from that in the cross-sectional study.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) has a unique activity to stimulate the release of multiple hormones in a number of human and murine endocrine systems. IL-6 also expresses such activities by activating IL-6-receptor (R)-mediated signal transduction pathways. Since the placenta produces both of these cytokines and endocrine hormones such as hCG, we investigated how these cytokines regulate hCG release by normal trophoblasts. Trophoblasts purified by Percoll density gradient released hCG from 120 min after stimulation with recombinant (r) IL-1 alpha, and its release was dependent on the rIL-1 alpha concentration used. The rIL-1 alpha-stimulated trophoblasts released a molecule with IL-6 activity antecedently, as determined by an IL-6-dependent cell line, MH60.BSF2 cells. The IL-6 identity of the released molecule was confirmed by goat anti-IL-6 antiserum. rIL-1-mediated hCG release from trophoblasts was completely abrogated to the basal level by pretreatment of the trophoblasts with PM1, an anti-IL-6-R monoclonal antibody. Identical results were observed with rIL-1 beta. These results showed that rIL-1-induced hCG release was totally dependent on IL-6- and IL-6-R-mediated signal transduction in human trophoblasts. The presence of peripheral monocytes in the purified trophoblast fraction, however, induced a rapid decrease in IL-6 and hCG release after their maximal release, suggesting some regulatory interaction between trophoblasts and the monocytes. In contrast, rIL-1-mediated enhancement of IL-6 and hCG secretion by purified trophoblasts was no longer observed at 24 h compared with that of the unstimulated trophoblasts, while spontaneous hCG secretion was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of trophoblasts with PM1. The results showed that IL-6 and hCG secretion might also be regulated by a number of agents besides IL-1, and that hCG secretion as well as its release is dependent on IL-6 and IL-6-R system in trophoblasts.\r"

  ".W": "Osteopenia is a frequent complication of anorexia nervosa (AN). To determine whether the deficit in bone mineral changes during the course of this illness, we studied 15 adolescent patients prospectively for 12-16 months using dual photon absorptiometry of the spine and whole body. At follow-up, mean weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) had increased significantly, although 6 girls had further weight loss or minimal gain (less than 1.2 kg). Spontaneous menses occurred in 2 girls, and 3 others were given estrogen replacement. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine did not change significantly (mean +/- SD, 0.836 +/- 0.137 vs. 0.855 +/- 0.096 g/cm2), while whole body bone mineral density increased (0.710 +/- 0.118 vs. 0.773 +/- 0.105; P less than 0.05). Despite gains in bone mineral, 8 patients had osteopenia of the spine and/or whole body. Changes in weight, height, and BMI were significant predictors of change in bone mineral density. Increased bone mass occurred with weight gain before return of menses; conversely, weight loss was associated with further decreases in bone density. In 1 patient who failed to gain weight, estrogen therapy resulted in increased spinal, but not whole body, bone mineral. We also studied a second group of 9 women who had recovered from AN during adolescence. All 9 had normal whole body bone mineral for age, but 3 had osteopenia of the lumbar spine. We conclude that osteopenia in adolescents with AN reflects bone loss, perhaps combined with decreased bone accretion. Weight rehabilitation results in increased bone mineral before the return of menses. Estrogen may have an independent effect on bone mass. The persistence of osteopenia after recovery indicates that deficits in bone mineral acquired during adolescence may not be completely reversible.\r"

The study was performed on nine male healthy volunteers submitted to a 325 min glucose-controlled glucose iv infusion using the Biostator. The endogenous secretion of pancreatic hormones was inhibited by somatostatin. Three experiments were performed in each subject on different days and in random order. In all cases glucagon was replaced (58 ng min-1). The amounts of insulin infused were identical in all instances and were 0.2 mU kg-1 min-1 (continuous), 1.3 mU kg-1 min-1, 2 min on and 11 min off (13-min pulses) or 2.6 mU kg-1 min-1, 2 min on and 24 min off (26-min pulses). Blood glucose levels and glucose infusion rate were monitored continuously by the Biostator, and classic methodology using D-[3-3H] glucose infusion allowed to study glucose turnover. When compared with continuous insulin, 13-min insulin pulses induced a significantly greater inhibition of endogenous glucose production. This effect disappeared when insulin was delivered in 26-min pulses. We conclude that, in man, an adequate pulse frequency is required to allow the appearance of the greater inhibition of pulsatile insulin on endogenous glucose production.\r"

  ".W": "Chromogranin-A (CgA) is an acidic soluble protein with a virtually ubiquitous occurrence in normal human neuroendocrine tissues. Of the many potential tissue sources of CgA immunoreactivity, which contribute to basal (unstimulated) circulating CgA? To explore this question we studied the effects of selective and nonselective suppression of secretion at several sites within the neuroendocrine system. Selective disruption of sympathetic outflow by trimethaphan decreased basal CgA by 25%, suggesting that sympathetic neurons contribute to circulating CgA. Plasma CgA in patients with unilateral and bilateral adrenalectomy fell within the range observed in normal subjects, weighing against the adrenal medulla as a major source of basal circulating CgA. Selective suppression of a variety of anterior and posterior pituitary cell types decreased plasma levels of the usual resident peptide hormones, but left plasma CgA unperturbed. After propranolol treatment, plasma CgA remained unaltered. Secretin suppressed plasma PTH and calcitonin, but did not alter plasma CgA levels. On the other hand, widespread nonselective suppression of a variety of neuroendocrine secretory cells by somatostatin decreased plasma CgA by 48%. Plasma catecholamines were unaltered by somatostatin infusion, suggesting that somatostatin inhibited CgA release from nonsympathoadrenal sources. During the infusion of somatostatin, the plasma epinephrine increment in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was maintained, and plasma CgA did not fall, nor did it rise after somatostatin cessation. Taken together, these findings suggest that somatostatin did not inhibit transport of stimulation-released CgA from the adrenal medulla to the circulation. In conclusion, although the adrenal medulla is the major tissue source of CgA immunoreactivity in man, other neuroendocrine sites, including sympathetic axons and multiple endocrine glands, appear to influence the basal circulating concentration of CgA.\r"

We investigated the effect of human milk on PGI2 synthesis by human vascular endothelial cells by measuring its stable metabolite, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, by RIA. Human milk induced dose- and time-dependent stimulation of PGI2 production, whereas cow's milk was ineffective. The lowest concentration of human milk that stimulated the production of PGI2 was 0.1%, and 10% induced a 2.4- to 3.4-fold increase. The effect of human milk was detectable after 2 h and was blocked by inhibitors of transcription, translation, and cyclooxygenase. Boiling abolished the activity, but acetone extraction enhanced it. A 10% concentration of acetone-extracted human milk stimulated the release of endothelial cell PGI2 by 6.6-fold. In human milk samples we found no correlation between the amount of immunoreactive epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the activity stimulating PGI2 synthesis. Furthermore, EGF antibodies did not inhibit the activity. This is the first demonstration that human milk stimulates PGI2 production by endothelial cells. We conclude that human milk is a potent inducer of PGI2 production by human vascular endothelial cells and that the stimulatory activity is not due to EGF.\r"

Low 25OHD (less than 38 nmol/L) was found in 49 subjects (aged 52-77 yr). Women with low 25OHD had a reduced vertebral bone density (VBD), assessed by quantitative computed tomography, compared to age-matched controls (P less than 0.001). They also had significantly lower levels of serum calcium and phosphate, lower urinary calcium, higher serum alkaline phosphatase, and, in most cases, increased immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) concentrations, suggesting secondary hyperparathyroidism. Furthermore, only in the low 25OHD group did VBD correlate directly with 25OHD (r = 0.41; P less than 0.01), and inversely with iPTH (r = -0.47; P less than 0.01). Multivariate analyses revealed that iPTH was the major determinant of the observed decrease in VBD. Seasonal variations of serum 25OHD were noted only in the control population; in this group the 25OHD levels also correlated with sunlight exposure (r = 0.48; P less than 0.01), as assessed by an outdoor score. Thus, vitamin D deficiency develops when both the endogenous and exogenous sources are insufficient and contributes to a reduced bone mass in elderly women.\r"

  ".W": "Pergolide is a synthetic ergoline derivative with highly potent long-acting PRL-lowering activity, allowing therapy of hyperprolactinemia with a once daily administration of the drug. The results of two open-label, randomized controlled multicenter clinical trials are reported. Pergolide (taken once a day), was compared with bromocriptine (taken two to four times daily) regarding efficacy and safety in the reduction of PRL levels, the cessation of galactorrhea and amenorrhea, the improvement in sexual function, and tumor shrinkage in hyperprolactinemia without (trial I; 61 patients) and with radiologically evident pituitary tumors (trial II; 96 patients). Both drugs were equally effective in lowering PRL levels in both trials. A median optimal dose of 50 micrograms pergolide and 5 mg bromocriptine/day suppressed PRL levels in the 61 patients of trial I by more than 80%. During the 24-week investigational period galactorrhea disappeared in 96% and 87% of patients, whereas menstruation returned in 90% and 96% of patients, respectively. An equally high efficacy (optimal median dose: 75-100 micrograms pergolide, 7.5-10 mg bromocriptine daily) was observed in trial II, although the resumption of menses was less frequent than in the patients of trial I (50% and 58% of patients, respectively). Sexual dysfunction improved similarly on both drugs in about half the patients. In addition, tumor shrinkage occurred to a similar extent with both drugs. A high incidence of adverse events was noted especially at the initiation of therapy with both compounds: nausea, dizziness, vomiting, asthenia, headache, and decrease in blood pressure occurred at a similar incidence and extent during the use of pergolide and bromocriptine. Patients in trial I treated with pergolide reported a slightly higher incidence of fever, vasodilatation, and flu syndrome. Conclusions: in these 24-week studies comprising a total of 157 hyperprolactinemic patients, a once daily administration of pergolide was shown to be as safe and effective as the two to four times daily ingestion of bromocriptine. Longer-acting dopamine agonists like pergolide that can be taken once daily, are likely to increase the ease to adherence to the therapeutic regimen. This might result in a higher compliance to medical treatment of hyperprolactinemia.\r"

Tissue sensitivity to insulin and glucose effectiveness can be estimated using the minimal model analysis of an iv glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), but this method has never been applied to evaluate the impact of the menstrual cycle on these parameters. We, therefore, studied eight cycling women using tolbutamide-modified IVGTTs during three different phases of the same menstrual cycle: early follicular, midcycle, and midluteal. Insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose effectiveness were derived using insulin and glucose levels obtained from tolbutamide-modified IVGTTs and analyzed with the minimal model computer program. The mean SI (x10(-4)/min.microU/mL) decreased in a stepwise fashion from the follicular level of 6.20 +/- 0.91 to a midcycle level of 4.95 +/- 0.73 and was lowest in the luteal phase (3.20 +/- 0.25; P less than 0.007). No change in glucose effectiveness occurred as a function of the menstrual cycle. These findings indicate a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity in the luteal phase of the normal menstrual cycle, but no significant change at midcycle.\r"

We compared the ability of GH concentrations after pharmacological stimulation with levodopa and clonidine and of spontaneous peak and 12-h pooled GH concentrations during sleep on a single night to estimate the maximum spontaneous GH secretion from 2 nights in 55 children, aged 5-16 yr, with heights below the 3rd percentile and/or height velocities below the 25th percentile for age, who had two consecutive overnight GH secretory profiles. Maximum stimulated GH concentrations correctly categorized 80% of children who had maximum spontaneous GH concentrations above and below 4 micrograms/L using a double monoclonal immunoradiometric assay for GH (Tandem-R HGH, Hybritech). The remaining 20% of children had stimulated GH concentrations below but spontaneous GH concentrations above 4 micrograms/L. Using this cut-off, the maximum GH concentrations from the first and second nights correctly categorized 98% and 95% of the children, respectively. Night to night variation in GH secretion was low in children who had low spontaneous GH secretion (maximum spontaneous peak and pool GH concentrations, less than 4 and less than or equal to 0.7 micrograms/L, respectively), and pooled GH concentrations from the 2 nights were concordant in 98% of the cases. We conclude that it is not uncommon for stimulated GH concentrations to underestimate spontaneous GH secretion. Even without acclimatization to the hospital setting, measurement of spontaneous GH secretion on a single night was more reliable for identifying the child with low endogenous GH secretion than was GH stimulation testing alone.\r"

To examine estrogen's regulation of biologically active LH secretion in response to pulsatile stimulation by GnRH, we studied estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women basally and during treatment with diethlystilbesterol (DES; 1 mg, orally, daily). Basal and GnRH-stimulated plasma concentrations of bioactive LH were assayed by the in vitro rat interstitial cell testosterone bioassay. GnRH-promoted LH secretory bursts in response to two consecutive stimuli were quantitated by multiple parameter deconvolution analysis. Basal half-lives of LH averaged 171 +/- 17 min (immunoactive) and 223 +/- 10 min (bioactive). Analysis of variance revealed a significant decrease in mean basal plasma bioactive LH concentrations on days 10 and 30 of DES treatment. Mean serum immunoactive LH concentrations fell similarly. DES significantly increased the half-life of immunoactive LH (days 5 and 10), but did not change that of bioactive LH. GnRH self-priming of bioactive LH secretion (increased LH secretory peak 2 compared to peak 1) was demonstrated, with a maximal value on day 10 of DES treatment. In addition, the ratio of the mass of bioactive to immunoactive LH secreted in response to the first GnRH pulse was significantly enhanced by estrogen on day 5, whereas that after the second pulse of GnRH was significantly suppressed on day 30 of DES. The self-priming action of GnRH on bioactive LH release evident in the presence of oral DES was corroborated in a separate group of six women, who were treated for 30 days with 17 beta-estradiol via an intravaginally placed Silastic ring. In conclusion, we infer that estrogen exerts a highly selective effect on the gonadotroph secretory process, such that successive GnRH stimuli result in an increase in the maximal rate and mass of secretion of biologically active LH.\r"

  ".W": "In a prior study of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) binding to cultured thyroid cells, we reported that at 4 C, more than 95% of bound ANP is recovered on cell membranes, with negligible ANP internalization observed. Since ANP binding was inhibited by TSH, we have further studied TSH effects on postbinding ANP processing to determine whether this phenomenon reflects enhanced endocytosis of the ANP-receptor complex. An ANP chase study was initiated by binding [125I] ANP to thyroid cells at 4 C for 2 h, followed by incubation at 37 C. ANP processing was then traced by following 125I activity at various time intervals in three fractions: cell surface membranes, incubation medium, and inside the cells. Radioactivity released into medium represented processed ANP rather than ANP dissociated from surface membranes, since prebound [125I]ANP could not be competitively dissociated by a high concentration of ANP (1 mumol/L) at 37 C. Chase study results showed that prebound ANP quickly disappeared from cell membranes down to 34% by 30 min. Internalized ANP peaked at 10 min, with 21% of initial prebound ANP found inside the cells. At the same time, radioactivity recovered in incubation medium sharply increased between 10-30 min from 8% to 52%. Preincubation of cells with chloroquine (which blocks degradation of the ANP-receptor complex by inhibiting lysosomal hydrolase) caused a 146% increase in internalized [125I]ANP by 30 min (39% compared to 15% control), while medium radioactivity decreased from 52% to 16%, suggesting that processing of the receptor complex is mediated via lysosomal enzymes. In chase studies employing cells pretreated with chloroquine, TSH stimulated the internalization rate of ANP-receptor complex. By 30 min, TSH significantly reduced the membrane-bound ANP, and the decrease was inversely correlated to the increase in internalized radioactivity. In the absence of ANP ligand, TSH also modulated receptor translocation, resulting in decreased receptor number on surface membrane. However, TSH did not affect ANP degradation on the basis of analysis by immunoprecipitation and high performance liquid chromatography. Taken together, these data suggest that TSH downregulates ANP receptor on thyroid cell surface membranes, and that an ANP degradative pathway exists which is not mediated through receptor binding.\r"

However, such effects are not entirely consistent and depend on both the duration of pituitary exposure to steroids and the secretagogue employed. To further evaluate the effects of glucocorticoids in man, we have studied the response to four different GH stimulation tests before and after treatment with dexamethasone (DEX; 2 mg twice daily during 84 h). Twelve healthy male volunteers were divided into two groups of six subjects (groups A and B). Group A underwent stimulation tests with arginine (500 mg/kg, i.v.) and GH-releasing hormone (GHRH, 100 micrograms, i.v.) before and after DEX treatment. Group B were subjected to stimulation tests with two dopaminergic agents, a novel nonergot D2-dopamine agonist CV205-502 (CV; 10 micrograms, i.v.) and dopamine (4 micrograms/kg.min, i.v.), before and after DEX. Within each group, the effect of DEX on the different secretagogues was studied 4 weeks apart. GHRH-stimulated GH release was significantly blunted by DEX treatment [median peak GH value, 34.2 micrograms/L; 25-75th percentiles, 22.1-56.2), control, vs. 19.8 (9.7-34.5), DEX; P less than 0.05; integrated GH secretion expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) was 48% lower after DEX; P less than 0.01]. In the same group, DEX treatment significantly enhanced the response to arginine [10.6 (8.0-22.8), control, vs 26.1 (15.1-38.6), DEX; P less than 0.01; with an increase in AUC of 72%; P less than 0.01]. In group B, under control conditions before glucocorticoid administration, the GH response to CV was significantly greater than that to dopamine in terms of both peak response [25.1 (8.6-30.9), CV, vs. 11.8 (5.5-16.4), dopamine; P less than 0.05] and AUC [2406 +/- 654 (CV) vs. 658 +/- 125 (dopamine); P less than 0.01], suggesting that CV may be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of GH deficiency. After DEX administration, responses to both dopaminergic agents were suppressed [CV, 6.7 (4.0-21.2); P less than 0.01 vs. control response; and dopamine, 5.3 (4.8-7.9); P less than 0.05 vs. control response]. When compared with the effects of dexamethasone on the GH response to arginine, the results with dopaminergic agents highlight important differences in the mechanisms of action of these indirectly acting GH secretagogues. Moreover, this may be of physiological importance, because in contrast to the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoid on GHRH-stimulated GH release, DEX treatment significantly increased basal plasma GH levels [1.4 (0.5-5.1) vs. control 0.3 (0.1-0.6) microgram/L; P less than 0.001].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the secretion of mitogenic factors by human pituitary tumors we have cultured cells from 54 adenomas in serum-free medium. Conditioned media from 28 (52%) elicited dose-dependent stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into rat GH3 cells (22-338% above control), while 14 (26%) inhibited GH3 proliferation. Stimulating activity was observed more frequently in nonfunctional tumor-conditioned medium (73%; n = 22) than in secretory tumor-conditioned medium (37%; n = 32). Of 10 tumour-conditioned media with mitogenic activity for GH3 cells, only 4 produced modest stimulation of HEp2 (human laryngeal carcinoma) cells. In contrast, [3H]thymidine incorporation into A431 (human squamous carcinoma) and PC12 (rat adrenal pheochromocytoma) cells was enhanced by each of 15 tumor-conditioned media (up to 342% and 275%, respectively), 8 of which had shown stimulatory and 2 inhibitory effects on GH3 cells. Gel filtration of pooled conditioned media from 10 nonfunctional tumors showed significant growth-promoting activity for GH3 cells in fractions corresponding to mol wt of 2-3 and 11-18 kDa. Proliferative activity on A431 cells also eluted in two positions; one corresponded to the higher mol wt peak seen with GH3 cells, while the other, not observed with GH3 cells, was in the 3- to 6-kDa range. These findings suggest that cells derived from human pituitary adenoma tissue synthesize and secrete several growth factors, each of which may have its own target cell specificities. These factors have yet to be characterized, but we suggest that they may have a role in stimulating the development or maintenance of human pituitary adenomas.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of immunoreactive (IR) endothelin, endothelin mRNA, and endothelin receptors in human brain and pituitary gland has been studied by RIA, Northern blot hybridization, and receptor assay. IR endothelin was detected in all five brain regions examined (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brain stem, basal ganglia, and hypothalamus) (6-10 fmol/g wet wt) and spinal cord (22 +/- 6 fmol/g wet wt, n = 7, mean +/- SEM). Higher concentrations of IR endothelin were found in the pituitary gland (147 +/- 30 fmol/g wet wt). Fast protein liquid chromatographic analysis of the IR endothelin in pituitary gland showed a large IR peak in the position of endothelin-3 and a smaller peak in the position of endothelin-1, whereas IR endothelin in the hypothalamus and brain stem was mainly endothelin-1. Endothelin messenger RNA was detected by Northern blot hybridization in the pituitary but not in hypothalamus. The receptor assay showed that 125I-endothelin-1 binding sites were present in large numbers in all five brain regions but were much less abundant in the pituitary gland. Binding capacity and dissociation constant were 5052 +/- 740 fmol/mg protein and 0.045 +/- 0.007 nM in brain stem and 963 +/- 181 fmol/mg protein and 0.034 +/- 0.009 nM in hypothalamus. In the pituitary gland, there were two classes of binding sites for endothelin with dissociation constants of 0.059 +/- 0.002 nM (binding capacity = 418 +/- 63 fmol/mg protein) and 0.652 +/- 0.103 nM (binding capacity = 1717 +/- 200 fmol/mg protein). Endothelin-1, -2 and -3 were almost equipotent in displacing the binding (IC50 approximately 0.04 nM). These findings are in accord with the possibility that endothelin acts as a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator or neurohormone in man.\r"

We have performed a polymerase chain reaction on cDNAs prepared from normal thyroid mRNAs using primers 100 bases up-stream and down-stream from the 171 nucleotides that have been shown to be spliced out. Size analysis of the polymerase chain reaction products by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed bands at 0.2 and 0.37 kilobases (kb), sizes predicted to be obtained when the two forms of TPO cDNA are present. This was confirmed by hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to the 20 nucleotides of the junction site. After stringent washing, the 0.2-kb band gave a clear positive signal, which was stronger than that of the 0.37-kb band despite the latter cDNA being more abundant. This demonstrates clearly that the alternatively spliced form of TPO exists in normal thyroid. Its significance is discussed.\r"

Since the PTH-vitamin D endocrine system is a major regulator of calcium metabolism and bone turnover, this cross-sectional study examined the relationship of radial and lumbar bone density to vitamin D metabolite and PTH concentrations and to calcium intake and excretion in 67 white and 70 black highly comparable, healthy, premenopausal women. Bone density at both radial and lumbar sites was higher in blacks than in whites. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was slightly but not statistically significantly (P = 0.08), lower in blacks than in whites, but there were no racial differences in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, PTH, or renal tubular maximum for reabsorption of phosphate. The mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in blacks was well within the normal range and was not associated with evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism. There were no correlations of bone density to vitamin D or PTH concentrations. Although there were no racial differences in dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D or in sodium excretion, 24-h urinary calcium excretion was significantly lower in blacks than in whites, and calcium excretion was inversely associated with radial bone density. In contrast to previous reports, in healthy, normal weight, premenopausal black women there is no evidence of vitamin D deficiency or secondary hyperparathyroidism, suggesting that factors other than the vitamin D-PTH axis are responsible for racial differences in bone mass.\r"

  ".U": "91147549\r", 
  ".W": "Intact LH and free alpha-subunit (FAS) are differentially regulated during GnRH agonist (GnRHa)-induced pituitary desensitization; circulating levels of FAS rise, while LH levels decline. Increased steady state alpha and decreased LH beta mRNA levels in desensitized rat pituitaries suggest that differential regulation occurs at the level of subunit transcription. We assessed a renal contribution to these changes in serum hormone concentrations by studying LH and FAS levels in serum and urine in 15 pubertal children before and during long term GnRHa administration. Before GnRHa, serum LH and FAS were secreted in concordant pulses, and both responded briskly to exogenous GnRH. During GnRHa-induced pituitary desensitization, mean (+/- SEM) serum and urinary LH levels fell [11 +/- 3 vs. 2 +/- 0.2 IU/L (P less than 0.01) and 39 +/- 15 vs. 5 +/- 1 IU/g creatinine (P less than 0.05), respectively), and the LH response to exogenous GnRH was ablated (117 +/- 20 vs. 1 +/- 0.3 IU/L; P less than 0.01). In contrast, despite suppression of FAS pulsatility, mean serum FAS levels rose during GnRHa treatment (204 +/- 23 vs. 405 +/- 50 ng/L; P less than 0.01), and responsiveness to exogenous GnRH was maintained. Paradoxically, urinary FAS levels fell (3.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.4 micrograms/g creatinine; P less than 0.05) as did its renal clearance (3.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.1 mL/min.m2; P less than 0.05). We conclude that during GnRHa-induced pituitary desensitization, the gonadotrope maintains the ability to respond to GnRH with FAS release, and the rise in serum FAS is due in part to its diminished renal clearance.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolic effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and IGF-II were determined on human placental cells in monolayer culture obtained from early gestation (less than 20 weeks) and late gestation (38-42 weeks). Parameters studied were uptake of aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), uptake of 3-O-methylglucose and [3H]thymidine incorporation into cell protein. Since benzo[alpha]pyrene (BP) inhibits EGF binding and autophosphorylation in cultured human placental cells, particularly in early gestation, we also studied the effect of benzo[alpha]pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on EGF-mediated AIB uptake. The metabolic effects of EGF, insulin, and the IGFs in cultured human placental cells varied with gestational age and the growth factor studied. All three classes of growth factors stimulated AIB uptake in both early and late gestation at concentrations from 10-100 micrograms/L, well within a physiological range. However, insulin stimulation of AIB uptake was maximal at a high concentration (200 micrograms/L) in both early and late gestation cells, suggesting an action via type 1 IGF receptors rather than via insulin receptors. EGF stimulated 3-O-methylglucose uptake only in term placental cells. No significant stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation by any of the growth factors tested was seen with either early or late gestation cells. The effect of PAHs on AIB uptake by cultured placental cells was variable. BP alone stimulated AIB uptake by both very early and late gestation cells and enhanced EGF-stimulated AIB uptake. alpha-naphthoflavone alone inhibited AIB uptake at all gestational ages and inhibited EGF-stimulated AIB uptake. beta-Naphthoflavone and 3-methylcholanthrene minimally inhibited AIB uptake by early gestation cells and did not modify EGF-stimulated uptake at any gestational period. Our prior results demonstrated that BP more significantly inhibited EGF than IGF or insulin receptor binding as well as autophosphorylation in early gestation placenta, and that BP was the most potent of the PAHs tested. Thus, the direct effect of the PAHs on placental EGF receptors and amino acid transport may indicate altered function of EGF in the regulation of placental growth in smoking mothers that is developmentally regulated.\r"

He was clinically euthyroid, but had laboratory evidence of primary hypothyroidism. Radioactive iodine scan of the thyroid showed homogeneous uptake over an enlarged right lobe and absence of uptake over the left lobe. Two fine needle aspiration biopsies of the thyroid revealed the presence of Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii) organisms on the Gomori's methenamine silver strain. After courses of iv and oral therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a third fine needle aspiration biopsy failed to reveal any organisms. A repeated radioactive iodine scan of the thyroid showed return of uptake over the left lobe. Thyroid function tests normalized with levothyroxine, and the goiter decreased in size. To our knowledge, this is the first report of hypothyroidism associated with P. carinii infection of the thyroid. P. carinii infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infected individuals presenting with cold thyroid nodules. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is a valuable tool in assessing these patients.\r"

Recombinant human IGF I had identical elution positions as the isolated erythropoietic factor on reversed-phase HPLC and the same molecular weight on gel permeation HPLC. Furthermore, hrIGF I stimulated erythroid colony formation in human bone marrow cultures as was previously shown for the isolated human erythropoietic factor.

With a rapid DNA detection method we observed that all 6 individuals with complete HL deficiency from 2 families had the T383M mutation. None of 50 random unrelated unaffected subjects had this mutation. We propose that T383M is specific to families with heritable HL deficiency. Furthermore, structural variation at the HL gene, possibly in combination with other factors, appears to be etiologic in HL deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "In the first six months of a formal Internal Quality Assessment Scheme operating in the Department of Histopathology, Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool, 1005 items of data were gathered, relating to 80 cases. The scheme entails a random 2% sample of biopsy specimens being selected, each case being analysed using a structured proforma, and a numerical scoring system being allocated to all aspects of specimen handling. Technical and secretarial performance was good while the quality of clinical information provided by the requesting clinician was poor. There was a wide variation in reporting times, which related partly to the complexity of the specimen, and partly to the degree of supervision required by the reporting pathologist. Month by month analysis of reporting times showed a significant increase in reporting times associated with rotation of junior staff, but not with periods of annual leave. Pathologist performance scores were good, but close examination of components of the overall score for an individual pathologist indicated occasional areas of weakness (such as the adequacy of the macroscopic report). It is concluded that this scheme is worthwhile and its practice will be continued indefinitely. The comprehensive nature of the analysis allows for the formal identification of areas of work which need improvement, and the allocation of a formal numerical score allows improvement in these areas to be monitored. The monthly meetings provide a means whereby performance scores are fed back to the participating pathologists, and they are also of general educational value regarding histological reporting practice. It is intended that the scheme be extended to include the assessment of special stains, frozen sections, and adequacy of the report delivery service. The system is easily adaptable for use within other histopathology departments.\r"

In general, both antisera showed a similar pattern in terms of the distribution of HBcAg, with predominant localisation of HBcAg in the cytoplasm in HBeAg positive patients with chronic active hepatitis. Semiquantitative analysis showed, however, that there was a higher degree of cytoplasmic expression of HBcAg with polyclonal than with monoclonal anti-HBc. Some of the HBeAg positive patients with only a focal expression of HBcAg in the cytoplasm by polyclonal anti-HBc showed no expression of HBcAg with monoclonal anti-HBc. The expression of HBcAg with polyclonal anti-HBc correlated better with the histological features of chronic active hepatitis or the persistence of serum HBeAg on follow up, suggesting that it did not result from non-specific or false positive staining. All of the HBeAg negative patients with minimal histological changes or inactive cirrhosis were HBcAg negative with both antisera. In conclusion, though both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies produced a quite similar distribution of HBcAg in patients with chronic type B hepatitis, polyclonal antibody seemed to be more sensitive in detecting HBcAg in the cytoplasm than did monoclonal anti-HBc, and the expression of HBcAg with polyclonal anti-HBc correlated better with the clinical and histological outcome.\r"

Pre-S(1)Ag was found in all patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection regardless of viral replication. In contrast, pre-S(2)Ab was not detected in any patients. Acute hepatitis was studied sequentially with periodic controls at 20 day intervals. Pre-S(1)Ag cleared before HBsAg in six of 14 (43%) patients who progressed favourably, and the two antigens cleared simultaneously in eight of 14 (57%) cases. Patients with early clearance of pre-S(1)Ag progressed favourably, thus indicating the prognostic value of this test, which, however, is still of limited practical application given the small temporal difference between the moment of clearance of the two antigens. The first markers to clear, however, were HBeAg and DNA-HBV, which showed significant differences with respect to the clearance of HBsAg. Moreover, pre-S(2)Ab appeared before HBsAb in 57.1% of our patients and was found in some patients before pre-S(1)Ag and HBsAg had cleared (42.8%), thus allowing complete viral clearance and acute HBV infection to be predicted earlier.\r"

  ".W": "A new monoclonal antibody, QB-END/10, raised against the CD34 antigen in human endothelial cell membranes and haemopoietic progenitor cells, was studied for its usefulness as a marker of neoplastic vascular cells in 21 angiosarcomas and seven malignant haemangioendotheliomas of the liver. QB-END/10 was both more sensitive and more specific than Von Willebrand factor (VWF) and Ulex europaeus 1 agglutinin (UEA-1) in labelling endothelial cells and it did not cross react with epithelia as UEA-1 often does. Staining was uniformly strong and clear in all histological variants of these two tumours. QB-END/10 should prove particularly useful in the differential diagnosis of malignant vascular tumours of the liver.\r"

This system has greater flexibility than alkaline phosphatase conjugated polyclonal antidigoxigenin antibody and permits the use of alternative detector enzymes, such as horseradish peroxidase and fluorescence labels. The APAAP detection system that does not require the use of biotin can also be used in situations where endogenous biotin is a problem. The low level of background staining combined with precise substrate deposition of the amplified peroxidase system gives higher sensitivity and resolution. This permits localisation of closely adjacent chromosomal loci in interphase nuclei. The most sensitive peroxidase based digoxigenin detection system visualises two and a half to 12 copies of human papillomavirus (HPV) per nucleus. This system is also suitable for the analysis of low copy number HPV infection of cervical tissues.\r"

Analyses were considered adequate in 104, of whom 35 were normal and 69 had clonal abnormalities. Abnormalities were categorised according to banded chromosome analysis as well as chromosome count. Karyotypes were correlated with clinical and laboratory features at diagnosis and with survival. Of the successful analyses, thirty five (34%) children had no abnormalities; this group contained an excess of T cell disease. Twenty five (24%) had a \"characteristic\" hyperdiploid karyotype and as a group had lower presenting white counts, a tendency to CD10, and periodic acid schiff positivity of the blast cells and smaller spleens. None was an infant and only one was over 10 years old. Seven (7%) children with t(9; 22), t(8; 14), or t(4; 11) translocations were grouped together as \"specific\" translocations. Collectively they had a significantly worse prognosis than the remainder. Nine children developed central nervous system relapse, six of whom had either t(4; 11) or abnormalities of 9p or 19p. A descriptive classification taking into account chromosome bonding pattern is cytogenetically more appropriate and may be more clinically useful than grouping children simply by chromosome number. As knowledge and techniques improve, the classification of cytogenetic abnormalities in ALL will need to be kept under frequent review.\r"

Colonies of H pylori cultured from antral mucosal biopsy specimens of patients with non-autoimmune gastritis were washed with sterile saline, passed through a sterilisation filter, and the filtrate examined for urease, protease, and mucolytic activity. The filtrate failed to hydrolyse bovine serum albumin, or to degrade stable mucus glycoprotein structures of high particle weight that had been separated from human gastric mucus on Sepharose 2B. The high particle weight mucus glycoprotein was, however, extensively degraded when incubated with H pylori filtrate (which possessed urease activity) in the presence of 2 M urea, to release fragments of Mr approximately 2 X 10(6). The high particle weight mucus glycoprotein was also broken down to a comparable extent when incubated with Jack bean urease in the presence of 2 M urea, or 1 M ammonium carbonate, or 40 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.7), but not when treated with 4 M urea alone, or Jack bean urease alone. These results indicate that the loss of high particle weight mucus glycoprotein in gastric mucus from patients with gastritis and gastric ulcers is unlikely to be due to the mucolytic action of an extra-cellular protease produced by H pylori, but it may result from the destabilising effects of a carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, generated at the mucosal surface when H pylori urease hydrolyses transuded plasma urea.\r"

When the ELISA alone was compared with routine methods the specificity sensitivity, and predictive value of positive and negative tests was 73.2%, 75.7%, 51.1% and 38.5%. For ELISA with microscopy the same variables were 71.1%, 82.2%, and 92.4% and 94.7%, respectively. The ELISA absorbency increased with increasing bacterial numbers, but results varied widely. Only 65.4% of urines which contained greater than or equal to 10(5) bacteria/ml were positive by ELISA; 36.8% of urines with less than 10(3) bacteria/ml were positive by ELISA; 100% of greater than or equal to 10(5) bacteria/ml cultures of Pseudomonas sp (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), and Streptococcus faecalis (n = 2) were positive by ELISA but only 71.4% of Proteus sp (n = 7), 61.4% coliforms (n = 70), and 25% of coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 4). It is concluded that further development is required before the ELISA can be used for routine screening for urinary tract infection.\r"

Counterimmunoelectrophoresis was also used to detect antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens. Smooth muscle antibodies with the V pattern or antinuclear antibodies, mainly of the speckled type, or anti-IMF, occurred in 35 cases, being widely distributed in all groups. Such an autoantibody response resembles the \"viral\" autoimmunity described in various infectious diseases and in particular that of non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis. Autoantibodies may be of some prognostic relevance, as the prevalence of smooth muscle antibodies V increased as the disease progressed (asymptomatic carriers 20%, those with PGL 29%, those with ARC 47%, and those with AIDS 63%. In the PGL group autoantibody positivity correlated with the presence of skin anergy. The fact that autoantibodies were more frequently detected in patients with circulating immune complexes suggests that these can contain autoantibodies and the corresponding autoantigens.\r"

Cerebrospinal fluid samples were tested for the presence of P2 protein, a constituent of myelin, with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique using a specific polyclonal antibody. High concentrations of P2 in the cerebrospinal fluid paralleled a raised IgG index (clearance ratio), the presence of oligoclonal bands, as well as raised white cell counts or depressed albumin:IgG ratios. Twenty one patients had been diagnosed as having definite or probable multiple sclerosis and the remaining 32 had other conditions. Of the 13 patients with high positive P2, 12 (92%) were in the multiple sclerosis category; of the 40 patients with low (12) or undetectable (28) P2 concentrations, only nine (23%) were diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis. In this patient population the presence of high immunoreactive P2 concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid was closely associated with evidence of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis and with the clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. On this basis it is suggested that immunoassay of P2 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid may be of potential value in the investigation of patients with demyelinating disorders.\r"

Beta 2-microglobulin concentrations were significantly increased in both groups of hyperthyroid patients compared with controls. No difference was found in the thyroid hormone and beta 2-microglobulin concentrations between both sets of patients. The beta 2-microglobulin and thyroid hormone concentrations were not correlated. These data show that hyperthyroidism is another cause of increased beta 2-microglobulin production along with viral infections, immunologically mediated diseases, and malignant neoplasms. The increased serum beta 2-microglobulin concentration in thyroid hyperfunction is probably related to metabolic rate, even if autoimmunity might contribute to its overproduction.\r"

In the other indices evaluated fewer than eight of the required variables were available for retrospective assessment in most cases.

The participants (n = 61) were independently living individuals aged 60 to 94 years recruited through senior citizen centers, residential housing areas, and social agencies in Rutherford County, Tennessee. Three-day food records were used to collect dietary data, and nutrient intakes were compared with the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowances. Three-day social contact diaries were used to measure frequency of interaction with others. The Physical Health Questionnaire was used to evaluate subjectively the number and severity of disease states, and the loneliness index was computed using the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale. Energy and calcium were most likely to be underconsumed, and poor physical health was related to decreased intakes of vitamin A and ascorbic acid. Loneliness was related to dietary inadequacies. We recommend emphasis on education and services to provide home-delivered meals and groceries as well as affordable convenience foods of high nutrient density to enable older individuals to achieve adequate nutrient intake while maintaining an independent life-style.\r"

The malnourished sample consisted of subjects discharged with a protein-energy or protein malnutrition comorbidity. Subjects in the diagnosis-matched and age-matched control sample were discharged without a malnutrition comorbidity during the same period. Data collected from progress notes included diagnoses, inpatient dietetic feedings and services provided, discharge dietetic care, intervening clinic visits, and rehospitalizations. On initial admission, 79% of the diagnoses for the malnourished group fell into five diagnosis categories: neoplasms; respiratory system diseases; digestive system diseases; endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases; and mental disorders (including alcohol-related disorders). Malnourished subjects received more specialized feedings and dietetic services than did the controls on initial admission. However, the discharge and post-discharge care received by surviving members of both groups was similar. Fewer than half the members of either group received post-discharge care. Fifty-four malnourished and 54 control patients were hospitalized more than once. The findings indicate that levels of inpatient and outpatient dietetic care need to be coordinated to alleviate malnutrition.\r"

The Surgeons General of the Military Services established 1,700 mg sodium per 1,000 kcal as the goal for sodium content in menus served in military dining facilities. We tested the acceptability of quantity recipes with zero added salt and control recipes with added salt in military dining facilities. Twenty-eight test recipes with zero added salt were prepared and offered on the regular serving line. Military personnel selecting the test items rated them for acceptability on a nine-point hedonic scale. Only 6 of the 28 recipes with zero added salt were rated significantly less acceptable than the control recipes. Chemical analysis of the test recipes showed an 11% to 87% reduction in sodium and a 28% to 80% reduction in chloride. Our results indicate that dietitians and/or foodservice managers can produce quantity food recipes that are reduced in sodium and acceptable to customers.\r"

Data from a case-control study to determine the association of nutrient intake and risk of cervical dysplasia were supplemented by standard portion size information from the US Department of Agriculture and reanalyzed. Significant mean differences were found between intake calculated from reported portion size data and that calculated from standard portion size data for all nutrients. Correlation of nutrient intakes obtained by the two methods of data collection ranged from .73 to .92. Calculation of the rho statistic, measuring the consistency of classification of participants into groups of high, medium, and low nutrient intake, led to values ranging from .55 to .71, indicating some misclassification of study participants. To determine the effect misclassification had on the study outcome, odds ratios were calculated using nutrient amounts obtained from both methods of collecting portion size data. Results indicate that replacing reported portion size data with standard portion size data may lead to conflicting outcomes for specific nutrients in research concerning the relationship between diet and disease.\r"

A questionnaire was mailed to all athletic directors and teacher athletic trainers in North Carolina high schools. Of the 821 surveys sent, 303 were returned (a response rate of 37%). The sample was grouped into three categories on the basis of the perceived role of the respondent: coach (n = 152), trainer (n = 91), and dual coach-trainer (n = 29). Thirty-one individuals who indicated that they held administrative positions with little or no contact with students were omitted from the analysis. One-way analysis of variance or chi 2 was used to examine differences in questionnaire responses among the three groups. In comparison with high school coaches, trainers had taken more workshops or courses related to nutrition (2.9 compared with 1.8) and had more frequently used professional meetings (62% vs 39%), workshops (64% vs 41%), and textbooks (75% vs 50%) as sources of information. Trainers were more knowledgeable about nutrition (9.6 correct responses vs 8.9 for coaches) and recommended desirable nutrition practices more often than coaches (7 of 9 vs 6 of 9). There was some disagreement between coaches and trainers in their perceptions of who was more important in dispensing nutrition information. Future nutrition education efforts should take into account the differences among these groups.\r"

Fish oils are the only concentrated source of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 omega-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 omega-3). The major omega-3FA in plants is alpha-linolenic acid (LNA; 18:3 omega-3). LNA must be converted to EPA before it exerts biological effects similar to EPA, such as reduced platelet aggregation. Human beings convert LNA to EPA to a small extent only. LNA may be more readily oxidized than incorporated into tissues. The effects of consuming LNA-rich oils are more modest than the effects of EPA-rich oils. Evidence suggests that omega-3FAs are essential and highly desirable for brain and eye development and heart health. LNA is the only source of omega-3FAs for vegetarians. Because LNA and EPA are not biologically equivalent, food composition data or product claims mentioning total omega-3FA content must clarify the individual omega-3FAs present.\r"

The linear logarithmic relationship between mammalian body mass and maximum longevity, deleting bats and marsupials, is used as a standard against which to measure life spans of particular mammal groups. Bats have maximum life spans a minimum of 3 times those of nonflying eutherians--a trend resulting from neither low basal metabolic rate, the ability to enter torpor, nor large relative brain size. Marsupials live about 80% as long as nonflying eutherians despite averaging lower basal metabolic rates; similarly, there is no effect of heterothermy or relative brain size. These results directly conflict with predictions of both \"rate of living\" and brain-size mediated theories of aging. However, they are consistent with an evolutionary theory that posits exceptionally long life spans among mammals with reduced environmental vulnerability.\r"

RMR, adjusted for fat-free weight (FFW) and percent body fat, was lower in sedentary older men relative to the other three groups. TEM (kcal.180 min-1) was highest in active younger (77.3 +/- 3.7) and active older men (69.8 +/- 7.0) relative to sedentary younger (53.1 +/- 4.0) and sedentary older men (51.5 +/- 6.9). TEM was not related to age or body composition. A sedentary life style in older men may be associated with a lower RMR, independent of FFW and percent body fat, relative to younger men and older men who regularly exercise. Participation in physical exercise, regardless of age, is associated with a higher TEM.\r"

The onset and peak were further delayed for 1 min in the islets of 1-year-old rats. The onset of glucose-induced second phase of insulin secretion, and the onset and peak of K+ depolarization- and arginine-induced insulin release were not delayed in the islets of 6-month and 1-year-old rats. Glucose-stimulated increase in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) seemed not delayed in the islets of 1-year-old rats.

Baroreflex sensitivity was tested while the rats were awake by recording reflex heart rate responses elicited as blood pressure was elevated with phenylephrine or lowered with sodium nitroprusside. Sprague-Dawley rats had higher blood pressures and lower heart rates initially. Chronic infusion of enalapril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, into a lateral cerebral ventricle (ICV) for two weeks lowered blood pressure in Sprague-Dawley but not in Fischer 344 rats. Furthermore, reflex bradycardia was unaffected in either rat strain, but reflex tachycardia was selectively suppressed in Fischer 344 rats. Thus, although time controls were not done to rule out spontaneous changes during the 14-day infusion period, these results suggest that central cardiovascular regulation does not change similarly with age in these two rat strains. As removal of the brain renin-angiotensin system lowered blood pressure in one strain and inhibited reflex tachycardia in the other, the divergence could mean that the brain renin-angiotensin system acts differently to keep blood pressure elevated in Sprague-Dawley rats and modulate reflex tachycardia in Fischer 344 rats.\r"

Overall QL ratings were not strongly associated with objective indicators such as demographic characteristics and use of health care services.

We conclude that older, chronically ill patients generally consider their QL to be acceptable and affected by a variety of factors, including their perceptions of their emotional, socioeconomic, intellectual, and physical functioning. Furthermore, QL is poorly associated with objective indicators. Thus, in assessing the QL of elderly, chronically ill outpatients, physicians should elicit information regarding these perceptions.\r"

We observed stability of sleep efficiency and rapid eye movement sleep across three decades of late life, but a slight decline of slow-wave sleep in the 80-year-olds (decreased total delta wave counts). Women showed better preservation of slow-wave sleep than men. Automated EEG period analysis of this phenomenon demonstrated higher rates of delta wave production in the first NREM sleep period of women compared to that of men, a finding associated with longer REM sleep latencies in women. Unexpectedly, 80-year-old women showed decay in sleep maintenance, while 80-year-old men demonstrated stability of sleep maintenance, relative to their respective 60- and 70-year-old counterparts. Implications for the understanding of sleep and its regulation in health and aging are discussed.\r"

Twenty elderly and 20 young women were tested on two occasions. During the examiner-resisted test the examiner provided the resistance, and during the belt-resisted test the subject's contralateral leg provided the resistance while the examiner positioned the dynamometer. A four-way ANOVA indicated no occasion effects (p greater than .05). Within each group, similar torques were produced by both legs (p greater than .05). Test-retest intraclass reliability coefficients were good-to-high, ranging from 0.84 to 0.98 for the eight combinations of group-method-leg. The elderly females produced 61% of the torques produced by young females (p less than .01), and the examiner-resisted method produced 65% of the torques produced using the belt-resisted method (p less than .01). The belt-resisted method required less physical effort on the part of the tester, provided greater stabilization of the pelvis, and was preferred by 95% of the subjects.\r"

Indicators of physical health status included chronic disease status, number of drugs, physician visits, and days of hospitalization. After adjustment for age and sex, both functional ability and indicators of physical health status were found to be independent, statistically significant predictors of mortality. The results of this study further support the view that biomedical and functional assessment are both necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of the older population.\r"

Obese men with higher VO2max had lower % body fat and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) than obese men with low VO2max. The obese subjects with high WHR (upper body fat distribution) had higher systolic blood pressure, hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance, lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and higher triglyceride (TG). VO2max (ml/kg FFM.min) was lower in the older men (r = -0.54, p less than .001), and 32% of the variation was accounted for by age and the one-second forced expiratory volume. Although pulmonary function was normal, 50% of the variability was predicted by age, height, and VO2max or WHR. Glucose tolerance and insulin correlated better with VO2max and indices of body composition than with age, while plasma TG and HDL-C correlated with body composition, not VO2max or age. Thus, while age affects the cardiopulmonary and metabolic function of obese older men, physical inactivity, obesity, and an abdominal body fat distribution (increased WHR) contributed significantly to their reductions in physiological function.\r"

Recognition memory for both words, backgrounds, and word-and-background pairings was tested in all subjects. The interaction between age, instruction condition, and type of information tested was not significant.

Pain increased over the final year; one month before death 66% felt pain frequently or all of the time, substantially higher than a matched comparison group of living persons (24%). For both groups across the year, pain was associated with most measures of behavioral competence, perceived quality of life, and psychological well-being. Hierarchical multiple regressions indicated that background and health variables explained 28% to 32% of the variance of pain over the year. Controlling for background variables and health, pain contributed significantly to lowered happiness and to depression, but had no independent impact on hope and interest in the world. After controlling for physical health, the older old were judged to have less pain than the younger old.\r"

The SAILS utilizes behaviorally anchored rating scales to directly assess 10 areas of everyday functioning: Fine Motor Skills, Gross Motor Skills, Dressing, Eating, Expressive Language, Receptive Language, Time and Orientation, Money-Related Skills, Instrumental Activities, and Social Interaction. AD patients scored significantly worse than controls in all 10 areas. High correlations were obtained between the SAILS, visuospatial abilities, attention, and visual memory. In contrast, verbal memory, degree of depression, and praxis were not significantly correlated with the SAILS. The SAILS offers a criterion-based means of quantifying patient functional status for both clinical and research applications.\r"

Performance was not related to hearing sensitivity, thus suggesting that changes in the auditory mechanism that occur with age may encompass more than a loss of hearing sensitivity. Moreover, performance on the Repetition Test did correlate with memory for digits, which indicates a relationship between auditory processing and higher cortical functions.\r"

Cross-sectional analyses showed age differences: older cohorts reported greater overall well-being but lower levels of both positive and negative affect when compared to younger respondents. Longitudinal analyses indicated small but significant changes toward decreased positive and negative affect but increased overall well-being. Negative affect had the strongest effect size. Positive and negative affect showed different patterns of change for different age groups. Taken together, cross-sectional and longitudinal findings suggest that change in affect variables is age-related, although these changes are relatively small. More evident was a pattern of correlational stability with age. Finally, the pattern of the results supports a two-factor theory of psychological well-being.\r"

In addition, whereas older players deteriorated in motor performance during competitive play, young players improved motor performance in competition. This pattern of results replicates and extends previous research. It is suggested that the data reflect age-related differences in the ability to cope with high-arousal conditions as a result of age-related deficits in task-relevant cognitive abilities.\r"

Several possible reasons for this association are discussed: (a) methodological shortcomings of previous studies render the association spurious; (b) other psychosocial influences on mortality are involved and explain the association; and (c) self-evaluations of health status have a direct and independent effect of their own. Four-year follow-up mortality data from the Yale Health and Aging Project (N = 2812) are used to explore these possibilities. The analysis controls for the contribution of numerous indicators of health problems, disability and risk factors, and also makes adjustments of standard errors for the complex sample design. The findings favor the third possibility, an independent effect, to the extent that the particular set of psychosocial factors examined did not explain the basic association, and to the extent that the control variables were an adequately comprehensive set.\r"

Data from national vital statistics records were used for analysis of the changing age at death for percentiles of the population. Data from the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Census Bureau were used to calculate the force of mortality. The mean age at death for all percentiles, including the oldest groups, has risen during the interval. Examination of the coefficient of variation for the mean age at death suggests that there is a relative increase in the variability of age at death among the oldest old. The available data do not fit a hypothetical sequence of normal density distributions with an increasing mean and declining standard deviation. The force of mortality in those over 85 years appears to be decreasing in a pattern similar to that for those under 85 years. Current mortality patterns suggest an \"expansion,\" rather than compression, of mortality at the oldest ages. Further refinement of these observations, with improved data on mortality among the oldest old, will be helpful in delineating mortality patterns.\r"

The data set is the Supplement on Aging (1984 National Health Interview Survey); it has information for a national probability sample of community-dwelling persons ages 55 + (N = 16,148). (1) Arthritis people have more difficulty in physical functions, personal care, and household care than do nonarthritis persons. The excess disability is greatest for physical functions (walking, reaching, stooping, etc.). Disabled arthritis people have especially high degrees of difficulty in physical activities that require endurance and strength. (2) Various models are tested for walking, grasping, shopping, and light housework to show how comorbidity propels disability for arthritis people and to show arthritis' own contribution to disability in the presence of other chronic conditions. Difficulties escalate for arthritis people when they have other concurrent conditions. These models affirm that arthritis has a pronounced effect on physical dysfunctions, but these are not readily translated into personal and household care problems. Apparently, arthritis people often make successful accommodations so their roles and daily activities are not seriously affected by the disease.\r"

According to bottom-up theory, older adults first assess feelings of satisfaction within specific life domains that are based in part on the experiences (i.e., stressors) they encounter in these areas. The domain-specific views are subsequently synthesized to form an overall sense of satisfaction with life as a whole. In contrast, the top-down theory suggests that a person's ongoing sense of satisfaction with life as a whole predisposes him or her to assess satisfaction with specific domains in ways that are congruent with his or her initial sense of global life satisfaction. Analysis of data provided by older participants in a nationwide survey tends to support the bottom-up perspective.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanical ventilation (MV) is imperative in many forms of acute respiratory failure (ARF). The aim of this work was to review all episodes of MV in a Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) during the 11-year period 1976-1986. Four per cent (n = 1008) of 24,899 admissions to the MICU were treated with MV. The mean age of ventilator-treated patients was 53 +/- 18 years, and obviously it increased during the period of study. The average duration of MV was 4.7 d. MICU mortality, hospital mortality and 2-year mortality rates for patients subjected to MV were 33%, 38% and 46%, respectively. The mortality rate did not change during the study period. Cerebrovascular and malignant diseases carried the highest mortality rates, 75 and 79%, respectively, whereas mortality in patients ventilated because of drug overdose (n = 313) was only 2%. The results of this study confirm previously published findings concerning the outcome of MV, and we conclude that the effects of MV remain discouraging in medical and neurological patients. Improved quality of ventilator therapy and monitoring, as well as continued research directed at the causes of ARF, are equally important in reducing the mortality in ARF.\r"

RhEpo increased both haemoglobin (Hb) concentration and haematocrit (Hct) significantly, the values for Hb being 152 +/- 4.2 g l-1 before treatment and 169 +/- 9.3 g l-1 (mean values +/- SD) after 6 weeks of rhEpo treatment (P less than 0.001). The corresponding values for Hct were 44.5 +/- 1.5% and 49.7 +/- 1.9% (P less than 0.001), respectively. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values at rest were unchanged after rhEpo treatment. A marked increase in systolic blood pressure was observed during submaximal exercise at 200 W, the initial and final values being 177 +/- 14.2 mmHg and 191 +/- 19.5 mmHg (P less than 0.01), respectively. Heart rate during exercise at 200 W was significantly lower after rhEpo treatment than before it: 144 +/- 15 beats min-1 compared to 136 +/- 8 beats min-1 (P less than 0.001). The leucocyte count remained unchanged after rhEpo treatment, but there was a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in the number of lymphocytes. Reticulocyte and platelet counts were unchanged. Serum (S) ferritin decreased from 87.3 +/- 41.8 mmol l-1 to 59.3 +/- 27.8 mmol l-1 after rhEpo treatment (P less than 0.001). Serum-Na, S-K, S-Ca, S-creatinine, S-bilirubin, S-aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), S-alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), and S-lactate dehydrogenase (LD) were unchanged after rhEpo treatment. No subjective side-effects were reported. In conclusion, low doses of rhEpo increased Hb levels and Hct by more than 10% after 6 weeks. Blood pressure at rest was unchanged, but rhEpo induced a markedly accentuated blood pressure reaction during exercise. A minor decrease in the lymphocyte count was observed, but electrolyte and creatinine levels remained unchanged after rhEpo treatment.\r"

The normal diurnal rhythm, with increased ADH secretion during the night, was not seen in this group of elderly subjects, with the exception of elderly men who did not urinate during the night, in whom a substantial increase in plasma ADH levels occurred. In as many as 25% of all the ADH measurements performed (n = 455) ADH was not detectable by the method used. The lack of a definite diurnal rhythm in most of the elderly subjects could to some extent explain the increased diuresis during the night in the elderly.\r"

In 22 of these patients PGI2 and TxA2 production were also assessed before, during and after an exercise test performed 6 weeks after discharge. In approximately 24% of patients the in vivo production of prostacyclin did not increase during the acute phase of the infarction process. This inability was usually associated with a decrease in the release of heart muscle enzymes, and was mostly frequently observed in women. During the exercise tolerance test, none of the patients showed any increase in prostacyclin production, in contrast to healthy volunteers, in whom a significant increase was seen. There were no differences between patients with and without an increase in prostacyclin production during the acute phase. At the follow-up 2 years after the myocardial infarction, eight cardiac events had occurred, all of which were noted among patients who exhibited an expected increase in prostacyclin production in association with the infarction. This would seem reasonable, since most of the patients in this group had larger primary infarctions.\r"

Use of a limited number of pain-related elements (= 'criteria'), that had already been obtained in the emergency room, could improve the decision on whether or not to admit patients to the coronary-care unit. As an example, in one of the studies, use of such criteria would have reduced the number of 'unnecessary' coronary-care-unit admissions from 298 to 162, a 46% reduction (P less than 0.001). In the same patient sample, use of the criteria could have reduced the number of patients with definite acute myocardial infarction, admitted to the general wards, from 47 to 22, a 53% reduction (P less than 0.01). These favourable results were confirmed in the two independent, smaller-scale studies.\r"

In 30% of the patients all four observers were in agreement, whereas in 47% and 23% of the patients, two and three different diagnoses were given, respectively. Inter-observer variation was determined and kappa values between -0.04 and 0.54 were found. Intra-observer variation was smaller, revealing kappa values between 0.44 and 1.00. The present study suggests that clinical assessment of the thyroid gland may lead to misclassification of the type of thyroid disease, and thereby to a less than optimal choice of therapy.\r"

The study consisted of a 4-week run-in period, a 3-week active treatment period, a 4-week wash-out period and a second 3-week active treatment period. Twelve patients with type 1 diabetes with albuminuria, mild to moderate hypertension and a serum creatinine level of less than 200 mumol l-1 were included. Lisinopril reduced albumin excretion from 1343 +/- 337 micrograms min-1 to 879 +/- 299 micrograms min-1 (P less than 0.01), whereas nifedipine was without effect, 1436 +/- 336 micrograms min-1 vs. 1319 +/- 342 micrograms min-1. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unchanged by either drug. Both drugs increased effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) by about 20%. No differences between the drugs were observed with regard to their effect on renal haemodynamic parameters. By contrast, nifedipine exerted an inhibitory effect on several proximal tubular transport markers, whereas lisinopril was without effect. The different actions on tubular transport mechanisms exerted by lisinopril and nifedipine may contribute to the observed effect on albumin excretion.\r"

Five patients received placebo treatment, and the two groups were comparable at baseline. Angiotensin II levels decreased in response to captopril therapy. Skeletal muscle potassium, magnesium and chloride levels did not differ from reference values. Calcium was subnormal (P less than 0.0001), but increased to the reference range during captopril treatment. Phosphofructokinase, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, was in the lower reference range and increased (P less than 0.04) in response to captopril therapy. In conclusion, stable moderate heart failure is associated with low levels of skeletal muscle calcium and phosphofructokinase activity, these metabolic changes tending to return to normal levels with captopril treatment.\r"

Mini-Mental State Score, age, leucocyte count, presence of heart disease, diabetes, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and use of cardiovascular medication. This association between elevated serum creatinine and mortality was also found in patient subgroups with CT-proven infarction and intracerebral haematoma.

During the following year, these signs and symptoms persisted, and the patient also developed constant moderate pain in the epigastric region. Gastroscopy revealed a large lymphoma of the stomach, which was a high-grade malignant centroblastic type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After successful removal of the tumour, and six courses of potent cytostatic combinations, the patient recovered completely, and the granulocytopenia and cold intolerance disappeared.\r"

Each PCA extracted 15 factors relating to a range of cognitive impairments, as well as neuropsychological features consistent with posttraumatic personality changes. Measures identified by the PCAs were applied to 85 head-injured subjects in the series to examine the incidence of impairment in four neuropsychological areas: disorders of learning and memory, neuropsychological features consistent with posttraumatic personality change, slowness in rate of information processing, and a range of basic neuropsychological skills. Overall, impairments occurred in 70% of the series. Disorders of learning and memory were the most common type of deficit (56.5%), with disturbances in basic neuropsychological skills the least frequent (16.5%). Variability among subjects with respect to the types and combinations of neuropsychological impairments was a characteristic feature of this clinical group, but the largest proportion (one-third) demonstrated isolated impairments. The implications of the incidence and selectivity of neuropsychological impairments are discussed.\r"

Besides the expected differences in tests of motor function, the two groups also differed on a number of cognitive tests with no motor demands. The two cognitive functions that appear impaired were learning and memory. Given that similar deficits have been found in MS patients with more severe symptoms, it is argued that changes in cognitive function can occur in the mild stages of the disease.\r"
