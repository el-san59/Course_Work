The path of the adsorption isotherms at pH 1.2 and 7.5 suggests that the in vivo adsorption of tilidine HCl may be increased when the drug passes from the stomach to the intestine, unless the intestinal content exerts a displacing effect. Nevertheless, the adsorption was dependent on the quantity of activated charcoal used, becoming more complete when the quantity of activated charcoal was increased. The effects of additives on the adsorption capacity of activated charcoal were also investigated in vitro. Ethanol, sorbitol and sucrose significantly reduced drug adsorption, while cacao powder, milk and starch had no effect on tilidine adsorption. At an acid pH, Federa Activated Charcoal significantly adsorbed more drug than either Norit A or Activated Charcoal Merck.\r"

Two patients were identical twins aged 2 years 5 months being concomitantly poisoned, whereas one adult male was admitted twice. Their maximal phenytoin plasma concentrations were 246, 200, 168 and 164 mumol/l; the lowest values were in the twins. Despite this, consciousness in the children was more depressed whereas severe ataxia and involuntary movements dominated the course in the adult. All patients survived without any sequelae upon symptomatic treatment. Saturation kinetics of phenytoin could be demonstrated in all cases. For the twins, a Km in the range of 10.3-48.6 mumol/l was calculated, indicating saturation kinetics even within the therapeutic range of 40-80 mumol/l. In the twins, the Vmax was in the range of 47.3-79.4 mumol/l/day with a maximal elimination rate of 37.7-63.6 mumol/l/kg/day. We suggest that these kinetic parameters for phenytoin probably are independent of age.\r"

In addition to appropriate replacement of blood, platelets and clotting factors, prompt treatment of the prostatic carcinoma is required to correct the underlying pathophysiological defect. Ketoconazole is the ideal method for hormonal manipulation for patients with life-threatening complications of prostatic carcinoma (disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute paraparesis/paraplegia) because of its prompt onset of action in decreasing circulating concentrations of androgens to castrate levels. Serum testosterone levels are castrate within 48 hours of the initiation of therapy with ketoconazole as opposed to a minimum of 10 to 14 days with estrogens. A patient with spontaneous bleeding from disseminated intravascular coagulation was treated with 400 mg. ketoconazole every 8 hours and bleeding stopped within 48 hours. Ketoconazole is particularly valuable when a prompt therapeutic response is needed and orchiectomy is contraindicated because of bleeding diathesis (as in disseminated intravascular coagulation), delay in histological confirmation (as in acute paraparesis/paraplegia) or patient reluctance to undergo castration.\r"

In contrast with tissue from the proximal part and from controls, the distal samples revealed a marked reduction in the noradrenergic innervation of the muscle coat. In addition acetylcholinesterase-containing nerves associated with the basal aspect of the epithelium were usually absent from the distal portion of the vas deferens. These findings have been considered in relation to the contractile and secretory activities of the organ following vasovasostomy and may be of importance to the maturation and fertility of spermatozoa.\r"

Using the alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulating and blocking agents clonidine and rauwolscine in rabbit and human detrusor preparations, the presence of prejunctionally located inhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptors could also be demonstrated. The findings indicate the possibility of a functionally important interaction between cholinergic and adrenergic nerves in the urinary bladder mediated via inhibitory muscarinic receptors on adrenergic nerve terminals.\r"

Remodelled ileum was used to fashion this reservoir like the Kock pouch, but without either of the intussuscepted nipple valves which it uses. Ureters were implanted directly into the wall of the reservoir using a nonrefluxing technique. Continence was obtained by plication of a short limb of intact ileum exiting from the reservoir through which intermittent catheterization was performed. Three of four animals which remained infection-free had good to excellent results. Reservoir infection in four additional animals was associated with failure due to ureteral obstruction. The advantages of this reservoir include the use of ileum to achieve a low-pressure reservoir, the absence of the complex nipple valves of the Kock pouch, and the absence of foreign bodies such as staples and artificial sphincters. While the followup in this study is recognized as relatively short-term, the successes seen in this difficult-to-use animal model suggest that further evaluation of this simplified procedure is warranted.\r"

The rest (71.6%) showed different non-papillary patterns. Papillary stones, type 1 (61 calculi), had an apatite plaque of intrapapillary origin of which 14 showed calcified tubules. Type 2 showed other substances, presumably due to crystalluria but not to an interstitial papillary process (28 stones). Type 3 showed no plaques in their concave faces (53 stones). In types 1 and 2 whewellite is a secondary growth, the plaque acting as a trigger for the development of calcium oxalate. The possibility of hidden Randall's plaques is discussed. Stones with papillary patterns are not as rare as hitherto considered and merit microscopical study.\r"

The procedure was well tolerated and caused a persistent, unchanging degree of partial ureteric obstruction. Pathological changes of obstructive uropathy were produced.

Bilateral intracorporeal pressure, blood flow within the internal pudendal artery, and systemic blood pressure were monitored. Venous outflow restriction was evaluated by continuous saline infusion of the corpus cavernosum with the infrarenal aorta clamped. When delivered by intracorporeal injection, both drugs induced erection in a manner similar to that of intracorporeal injection of papaverine. Internal pudendal arterial flow increased slightly at the beginning of tumescence, and excellent venous restriction occurred. Intravenous injection, however, could neither induce an erection nor facilitate an erection after sub-threshold neurostimulation. We believe that the alpha-adrenergic antagonist properties of chlorpromazine and trazodone probably cause priapism by local action.\r"

The techniques were modified from and compared to similar procedures used in an animal model where adjacent extradural roots were connected through a nerve graft. We have shown previously that the unilaterally decentralized bladder of the cat can be recentralized after a nerve crossover procedure. If additional laboratory studies can document return of useful bladder function we anticipate that selected patients may benefit from similar nerve crossover techniques to bypass a spinal cord lesion to recentralize the bladder.\r"

In the constricted group, systemic blood pressure (BP) was significantly higher and plasma renin activity (PRA) was significantly lower than in the control group. Subpressor doses of AII and NE injections in the constricted group produced significant elevations of BP. In the aortic, renal and iliac arterial strips, the reactivity to AII (10(-10) to 10(-8) M) and NE (10(-10) to 10(-7) M) was significantly increased in the constricted group as compared to the control group. In the constricted group, sodium loading produced BP elevation with decreased PRA and shifted the dose-response curves by AII and NE to the left, whereas sodium restriction decreased BP and shifted the curves to the right. In the control group, altered sodium intake did not affect BP but affected only the dose-response curves by AII. These results suggested that in the chronic phase of renovascular hypertensive rabbits, the increased reactivity to AII and NE may contribute to the maintenance of hypertension.\r"

The tissue was examined for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like immunoreactivity in nerves, acetylcholinesterase-positive staining in nerves and noradrenaline content. Impotence was due to a variety of causes; 11 patients were classified as a 'non-neuropathic' group on the basis of their clinical history which included Peyronie's disease, vascular disease, hypertension and psychogenic impotence. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like immunoreactive and acetylcholinesterase-positive nerves were present and the pattern and distribution were similar in each patient in this group. The noradrenaline content of the tunica albuginea was significantly lower than the corpus cavernosum (p less than 0.02), although there was a linear relationship between the noradrenaline contents of the two regions (r = 0.95, p less than 0.01). By comparison, a complete absence of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like immunoreactivity in nerves was observed in a patient with a cauda equina lesion. Five out of six diabetic patients studied revealed a marked reduction in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like immunoreactivity in nerves associated with the cavernous smooth muscle, while acetylcholinesterase-positive staining was reduced in three out of five diabetic patients studied. The noradrenaline content of the corpus cavernosum from diabetic patients was significantly lower (p less than 0.02) than that of the 'non-neuropathic' group. The noradrenaline content of the tunica albuginea, however, was similar in both groups. The results provide evidence that VIPergic, cholinergic and adrenergic nerves in the penis are affected in diabetes mellitus and thus may contribute to the development of impotence in diabetic patients.\r"

The most common complications were colic pain (30 per cent) and fever (23 per cent). In 4 patients other complications, that is bacteremia, gastrointestinal bleeding, ureteral injury and subcapsular renal hematoma, were observed but they were treated conservatively with no serious adverse effects. Our study demonstrates the safe use of this method for clinical treatment.\r"

Tract dilation was performed over the 0.017-inch puncture wire. Successful renal access was achieved in 28 of 30 kidneys (93 per cent) and in 1 session the targeted stone was removed in 26 (87 per cent). Two patients failed the retrograde technique and underwent successful antegrade stone removal under the same anesthesia. Two patients required open stone removal. No patient required a second percutaneous procedure for incomplete stone removal, no major bleeding episodes occurred and no complications requiring surgical intervention were encountered. The technique of retrograde percutaneous nephrostolithotomy is a safe and reliable means to achieve precise, atraumatic intrarenal access. It is easy to learn and does not require the expertise of a trained radiologist.\r"

All affected kidneys had reduced renal function (26 +/- 7 ml. per minute per 1.73 body surface area) evaluated from total and separate glomerular filtration rate studies using 51chromium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid clearance technique and isotope renography. Four patients without signs of obstruction operated upon because of renal calculi were used as controls with separate glomerular filtration rates greater than 40 ml. per minute per 1.73 body surface area bilaterally. The drainage function of the renal pelvis was studied by diuresis renography, simultaneous intrapelvic pressure measurement and fluoroscopy during infusion of roentgen contrast medium at a constant rate of 10.5 ml. per minute. The caliceal dilatation was calculated from planimetrical measurement of defined calices. The intrapelvic pressure gradually increased in all kidneys to a maximum value varying from 25 to 81 cm. water (average 47 +/- 15). In the control kidneys the intrapelvic pressure varied from 10 to 18 cm. water (average 14 +/- 3). Significant dilatation of the caliceal system did not occur until intrapelvic pressure values above 25 cm. water were measured. Caliceal dilatation and maximal intrapelvic pressure were correlated significantly to each other at a correlation coefficient of 0.95. Intrapelvic pressure flow measurement with contrast medium and roentgen film exposure at the time of increased pressure proved to be a useful method to diagnose outflow obstruction. The test was of particular value in cases of clinically suspected intermittent hydronephrosis, giving more reliable information than conventional renography and diuretic urography. The test could be used even when the glomerular filtration rate was decreased, thereby providing information on the presence of obstruction in cases when conventional renography and diuresis urography sometimes fail.\r"

The relationships of subsequent metastasis to tumor stage and grade, as well as the presence of vascular, renal parenchymal or renal hilar invasion were evaluated by parametric and nonparametric statistical tests. Corrected 5-year survival rates for grades 1 to 3 tumors were 100, 67 and 5 per cent, respectively. Grade 3 tumors demonstrated more invasion of the blood vessels, hilus and renal parenchyma compared to grades 1 and 2 tumors (p less than 0.005, 46 patients). Moreover, invasion of renal hilar tissues had greater predictive value for subsequent distant metastatic spread (95 per cent, nonparametric) than either vascular (83 per cent) or renal parenchymal (77 per cent) invasion. Metastases developed in 27 of 48 patients during followup periods of 2 to 39 years. The pattern of metastatic lesions revealed that local spread to hilar soft tissues occurred in 92 per cent of the patients who subsequently had distant metastases. Spread to retroperitoneal lymph nodes and ipsilateral ureteral mucosa occurred in 84 and 44 per cent of the patients, respectively. Our study illustrates the potential value of analysis of individual histological parameters to evaluate the likelihood of subsequent metastasis.\r"

The complex pitted urethral mucosa at and below the verumontanum was not assessed. Either or both lesions were present focally in 211 transurethral prostatic resection specimens (72 per cent) and in 51 intact urethral specimens (97.5 per cent). Brunn's nests and glandular metaplasia consisted chiefly of transitional cells but in 47 transurethral prostatic resection cases glandular metaplasia contained prostatic acinar-type cells and in 1 case intestinal-type goblet cells were noted. Brunn's nests and glandular metaplasia were associated with inflammation in only 27 per cent of the cases and were not associated with dysplasia or urethral tumors except for 1 benign papilloma. We conclude that Brunn's nests and glandular metaplasia are so common in the supramontanal prostatic urethra that they represent normal urothelial variants in this segment of the urinary tract.\r"

Of 4 patients with stage D disease 3 died within 13 months, while 1 still is alive at 48 months. No patient with a Gleason tumor score of 8 to 10 survived more than 13 months. Patient age at presentation appears to be less important than clinical stage, histological grade or treatment modality in the prediction of the course of prostatic cancer. Young men with localized disease at presentation should be treated aggressively and they should have survival rates comparable to actuarial expectancy.\r"

Treatment-related side effects were encountered in 21 patients and consisted of asthenia, gastrointestinal complaints, skin reactions and cardiovascular complications. They were judged to be mild in 8 patients, moderate in 5 and severe in 8. Treatment had to be discontinued because of side effects in 7 patients (32 per cent). During treatment with ketoconazole serum testosterone levels decreased rapidly and attained nearly castrate levels at the end of week 3. However, after 1 month a steady increase was noted and the testosterone levels reached low normal ranges after 5 months. No hormonal or biochemical indications of adrenocortical insufficiency were noted. High dose ketoconazole is effective in the treatment of disseminated prostatic cancer.

In only 3 of these 10 men (only 1 with cancer) did hematuria occur in more than a third of the testings or on subsequent microscopic urinalysis. The degree of hematuria was unrelated to the seriousness of its cause. We conclude that in this population hematuria occurs so intermittently that when found on routine urinalysis, regardless of quantity, serious underlying pathological conditions must be ruled out aggressively.

In addition to these standard tests, we have used conduit urodynamics to study conduit function with a triple lumen urodynamic catheter to measure simultaneously conduit pressure proximal and distal to the fascia during filling under fluoroscopy. In 4 control patients with normal upper tracts who were studied with this technique conduit leak point pressures ranged from 5 to 20 cm. water pressure. Six patients with bilateral hydroureteronephrosis were studied to evaluate conduit function.

They are sensitive and capable of giving high quality, reproducible pressure recordings. They do not require the determination of a reference point but they are expensive and fragile, and calibration may be difficult to perform. We describe our experience with a new catheter for pressure recording based on fiberoptic technology. In addition to the advantages of the conventional microtipped catheters, the new catheter is thinner (4F), easier to calibrate and less expensive. Controlled testing of the new catheter was performed in an experimental setting and in clinical trials during urodynamic evaluation. The catheter provides reliable pressure recordings compared to standard microtipped catheters.\r"

Special adjustments of the gantry and water level, as well as shielding of the lungs, were necessary in those children less than 135 cm. in height or 30 kg. in weight. Hospital stay averaged 2.5 days and ranged from 1 to 6 days. There were no major intraoperative complications. Postoperative pulmonary edema developed in 1 patient and only 3 required parenteral analgesics for postoperative pain control. Of the 12 patients for whom a 3-month followup is available 10 are free of stone. One patient required ureterolithotomy for removal of impacted stone fragments. We conclude that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is a safe and effective method of treating renal calculi in children.\r"

Of 7 cases (46 per cent) with abnormal cephalad renal displacement the kidney was on the right side only in 3 and it was bilateral in 4. The omphalocele contents consisted of gastrointestinal tract only in 9 patients, and liver and gastrointestinal tract in 6. All 6 patients with omphaloceles that included the liver had cephalad renal displacement. One patient with small bowel alone in the omphalocele had right kidney displacement.

Seventeen major complications (12.7%), including three deaths, occurred, as well as five minor (3.7%) and 13 radiologic complications (9.7%). The last group showed no clinical symptoms. The frequency of complications in our series is high compared with that found in a survey of 13 studies with 2043 patients. The most marked discrepancy was our high frequency of septic symptoms. A mortality rate of 2.2% was also higher in our series, but we have consequently registered the 30-day mortality rate to make comparisons with surgical series relevant. Radiologic alterations are usually not reported in other series probably because they are regarded as a part of the method, but we consider these alterations as potentially dangerous and important to report because they can result in clinically relevant complications. Because of the complications PTA should only be performed in centers in which complications can be optimally treated.\r"

LSV was used in all cases because a satisfactory greater saphenous vein (GSV) was unavailable to accomplish the proposed revascularization. Indications for operation were rest pain, ulceration, and gangrene (74%), and 26% had claudication alone. Fifty of the 56 procedures were femorotibial and femoroperoneal bypasses. Three graft combinations were used: LSV alone (29), lesser saphenous vein and other autogenous vein composites (LSV/AUTO) (14), and lesser saphenous vein with synthetic composite grafts (LSV/SYN) (13). Graft patency rates were determined by life-table analysis. The 3-year patency rate for LSV was 60% and for LSV/AUTO was 38%. LSV/SYN graft composites had a graft patency rate at 18 months of 21%. These data suggest that the LSV may function as an autogenous venous graft for lower extremity revascularization when sufficient GSV is not available.\r"

The incidence of hypertension (greater than 180/90 mm Hg) refractory to preoperative medical therapy (88%), severe coronary disease documented by angiography (40%), and postoperative azotemia (33%) or oliguric renal failure (15%) was significantly higher among patients with bilateral renal artery disease (p less than 0.05). In addition, this group had twice the early mortality rate (15%) of patients having unilateral renal artery lesions (7.1%). During a mean follow-up interval of 37 months, medical control of hypertension was enhanced in 46 of the 80 operative survivors (58%), and renal function improved or remained stable in 63 survivors (79%). Five-year actuarial survival presently is 65% for the entire series, with a cumulative mortality rate of 38% among patients who underwent aneurysm resection (mean age 64 years) in comparison to 15% (p = 0.03) for those patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease (mean age 60 years).\r"

Medical management and extracranial-intracranial bypass do not appear to offer these patients any protection from symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency. Our initial treatment in 11 of 12 patients who had this pattern of extracranial arterial occlusion has been external carotid artery revascularization. Nineteen procedures were performed for symptomatic lesions in all cases except one. There were no perioperative strokes or deaths. During a mean follow-up of 44.7 months, no new strokes occurred. Among 10 patients undergoing external carotid artery revascularization alone, only one transient ischemic attack occurred in follow-up. Seven of the eight surviving patients are presently asymptomatic. External carotid artery revascularization may be an effective and durable treatment for the patient with bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the influence of hemodynamic conditions on intimal thickening of arterially transplanted autologous vein grafts, two experimental models of canine femoral arteries were prepared. In group I, in which an autologous vein graft was transplanted under abnormal flow conditions (distal poor runoff), intimal thickening gradually developed and reached 358 +/- 33 microns at 8 months, whereas no thickening was observed under normal flow conditions at any time throughout the observation period. In group II the thickened intima, which developed under abnormal flow conditions for 1 month, was reimplanted into the contralateral leg under normal flow conditions. The thickness of the intima markedly regressed to about 66% at 1 month, 50% at 3 months, and 25% at 8 months, respectively, whereas no regression of the thickened intima was observed under continued abnormal flow conditions. Electron microscopic studies revealed that the thickened intima in group I was composed of proliferation of transformed smooth muscle cells with a marked increase in the mitochondria, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and an abundant fibrous matrix, whereas with the regressed thickness of the intima of group II, the smooth muscle cells were spindle-shaped with distinct myofibrillae. These results provide pertinent data on the process involved in the intimal thickening in cases of graft placement.\r"

Ninety-two percent of the patients were considered to have good results (30% cured and 62% improved). Four patients were classified as unsuccessfully treated; one died postoperatively of myocardial infarction. All patients underwent late angiographic studies, with only one graft thrombosis being identified. No evidence of anastomotic stenosis, graft dilatation, or false aneurysm occurred during the follow-up period. From this experience, we believe polytetrafluoroethylene grafts are a valuable alternative to other graft materials for renal artery bypass and may be the preferred graft in the management of atheromatous lesions.\r"

Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts were implanted in 41 dogs as thoracoabdominal aortic bypasses for six durations of implantation between 2 hours and 6 months. The inoculum containing an average of 10(8) viable bacteria/ml was then injected intravenously in 1 minute. Normal dog aortas were used as controls. They entrapped very few bacteria (0.7 +/- 1.7 colony-forming unit [CFU]/cm2). Colonization of ePTFE grafts was maximal after 2 hours of implantation (589 +/- 733 CFU/cm2). Bacterial entrapment decreased after 2 days (225 +/- 315 CFU/cm2, p less than 0.001) and 8 days (70 +/- 115 CFU/cm2, p less than 0.001) of implantation, but it was similar after 8 days, 1 month (83 +/- 90 CFU/cm2), or 6 months (93 +/- 143 CFU/cm2) of implantation. Colonization of ePTFE measured after 2 months of implantation (371 +/- 591 CFU/cm2) was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than after 1 or 6 months of implantation. More than 500 CFU/cm2 were seen in 37% of the prosthetic fragments tested after 2 hours of exposure to blood; 99% of the fragments tested after 6 months of implantation trapped less than 500 CFU/cm2. Scanning electron microscopy showed that staphylococci were mostly seen on native fibrin deposits, particularly after 2 hours and 2 months of implantation. That persistent susceptibility of a flow surface devoid of endothelium to hematogenous bacterial colonization has to be taken into account to prevent delayed graft infections. Furthermore, it would be important to compare the ePTFE with other types of grafts whose healing phenomena are different.\r"

Ten patients underwent bypass grafts (three vein and seven prosthetic grafts) from the supraceliac aorta incorporating the celiac axis to the superior mesenteric artery. All patients had two- or three-vessel mesenteric arterial occlusion. No operative deaths occurred. Nine patients were studied with postoperative arteriography. Nine of ten patients have had satisfactory results on follow-up from 5 to 99 months (mean 43 months), although two patients required operative revision to achieve this. The operative technique is described, including approach to the aorta in the lower mediastinum via upper abdominal exposure and pancreatic displacement to expose the superior mesenteric artery. This method permits avoidance of the infrarenal aorta, if desired because of atherosclerotic disease or previous operation. Antegrade supraceliac aortomesenteric grafts avoid turbulence and compression of conventional \"retrograde\" bypass beneath the mesentery. We conclude that supraceliac aortic grafts provide a useful visceral artery reconstruction technique.\r"

Follow-up examinations at 3-month intervals during the first 18 months and at 6-month intervals thereafter were performed to document the return of ischemic symptoms or loss of peripheral pulses. Ankle pressure index and pulse volume recordings were also measured. A decrease in ankle pressure index equal to or greater than 0.2 or a pulse volume recording decrease of 5 mm or more with or without confirmatory symptoms were indications for repeat arteriography. Twenty-two primary graft or anastomotic stenoses were discovered in 19 grafts during follow-up. Seventy-eight percent of these lesions were treated primarily by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the remainder were treated by short proximal interposition grafts or patch graft angioplasty. Twenty-five grafts occluded during follow-up and all of these were considered to have failed for purpose of life-table analysis. Stenotic lesions, which were corrected before occlusion, were listed as continuously patent under secondary patency and as failed under primary patency life-table analysis. The secondary graft patency rate was 70% at 5 years, which was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than the primary patency rate (47%), which was obtained without intervention. This 23% differential represents graft salvage achieved by careful surveillance and is reflected not only by improved patency but also by high limb salvage rates (86%) observed at 5 years.\r"

Epstein-Barr virus serology could not reliably differentiate individual case-patients from the others, and the reproducibility of the tests within and among laboratories was poor. As a group, the case-patients appear to have had a syndrome that is characterized by chronic fatigue, fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy.

  ".W": "We studied past contraceptive use in 283 nulliparous infertile women who had a diagnosis of tubal adhesions or occlusion and in 3833 women admitted for delivery at seven collaborating hospitals from 1981 to 1983. The relative risk of tubal infertility associated with barrier contraceptive use or oral contraceptive use was calculated using multivariate logistic regression to control for confounding by region, age, religion, education, smoking, number of sexual partners, time since menarche, and use of other contraceptive methods. Women who had ever used barrier methods of contraception were at a significantly decreased risk of tubal infertility (relative risk = 0.6; 95% confidence limits, 0.5 and 0.8). When type of barrier method used for the longest time was evaluated, those who used the diaphragm or condoms plus spermicides were at lower risk than those who used condoms or spermicides alone. Overall, past use of oral contraceptives neither increased nor decreased a woman's risk of tubal infertility, but there was evidence that the association between oral contraceptives and tubal infertility may vary by the amount of estrogen and type of progestogen in the oral contraceptive used. We conclude that contraceptive users who use barrier methods that combine both a mechanical and chemical barrier, such as diaphragms, cervical caps, and condoms plus spermicides, have the clearest protection against tubal damage.\r"

Tutors and clerks at the other two hospitals received no special intervention and served as controls. Experimental and control clinical clerks completed pretests and posttests of their ability to take and defend a stand on whether to apply specific diagnostic tests and treatments in specific clinical situations. Experimental clerks demonstrated both statistically and \"clinically\" significant increases in their critical appraisal skills, improving 37% on the diagnostic test exercise and 8% on the treatment exercise; control students' scores deteriorated for both.\r"

Only students in kindergarten (K) through grade 5 would have been affected by the immunization law. Students in the sixth grade were nearly seven times more likely to develop mumps than students in grades K through 5. The observed differences between the sixth graders and those in grades K through 5 most likely reflect the fact that sixth graders were not covered by the school law. Vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 91% (95% confidence interval = 77% to 93%). The total direct cost of the outbreak was $10,937 (clinic costs plus total cost to households). This outbreak demonstrates the significant impact of appropriate school vaccination laws on limiting the morbidity and economic and social costs of mumps.\r"

Knowing the specificity and sensitivity of a diagnostic test is necessary, but insufficient: the clinician must also estimate the prior probability of the disease. In the same way, knowing the P value and power, or the confidence interval, for the results of a research study is necessary but insufficient: the reader must estimate the prior probability that the research hypothesis is true. Just as a positive diagnostic test does not mean that a patient has the disease, especially if the clinical picture suggests otherwise, a significant P value does not mean that a research hypothesis is correct, especially if it is inconsistent with current knowledge. Powerful studies are like sensitive tests in that they can be especially useful when the results are negative. Very low P values are like very specific tests; both result in few false-positive results due to chance. This Bayesian approach can clarify much of the confusion surrounding the use and interpretation of statistical tests.\r"

  ".W": "To combat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Taiwan, a mass immunoprophylaxis program was launched on July 1, 1984, aiming first at prevention of chronic HBV carriage from perinatal mother-to-infant infection. In the first 15-month period, 352,721 (78%) of 450,585 pregnant women were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); HBsAg was present in 62,359 (18%), with 50% of them categorized as highly infectious. Infants born to HBsAg-positive women were given 5 micrograms of a plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine at ages 1, 5, and 9 weeks, with a booster at age 12 months. Infants of highly infectious carrier mothers received an additional 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin within 24 hours after birth. The coverage rate of the hepatitis B immune globulin was 77% in 27,375 infants born to highly infectious mothers, and that of the first, second, third, and the fourth doses of vaccine was 88%, 86%, 84%, and 71%, respectively, in infants of 55,620 carrier mothers. The reported untoward reactions to immunization were negligible. We conclude that a mass hepatitis B vaccination program is feasible in hyperendemic areas such as Taiwan; this should be a significant step toward the effective control of HBV infection in these areas.\r"

We found that six (3%) were seropositive for HIV antibody by both enzyme-linked immunoassay and Western blot analysis. All seropositives were trauma victims between the ages of 25 and 34 years, representing 16% of the trauma patients in that age group (n = 37). All seropositives were actively bleeding, and all required multiple invasive procedures. History of intravenous drug abuse was not discriminating in identifying potential seropositives. We conclude that infection-control precautions are indicated for both emergency department personnel and prehospital care providers (such as paramedics, police officers, and fire fighters) when caring for bleeding patients, whether or not previous suspicion of HIV infection exists.\r"

To assess the efficacy of the yeast-recombinant vaccine, we administered the vaccine in combination with hepatitis B immune globulin to high-risk newborns. If infants whose mothers were positive for both hepatitis B surface antigen and the e antigen receive no immunoprophylaxis, 70% to 90% become infected with the virus, and almost all become chronic carriers. Among infants in this study who received hepatitis B immune globulin at birth and three 5-micrograms doses of yeast-recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, only 4.8% became chronic carriers, a better than 90% level of protection and a rate that is comparable with that seen with immune globulin and plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine. These data suggest that, in this high-risk setting, the yeast-recombinant vaccine is as effective as the plasma-derived vaccine in preventing hepatitis B virus infection and the chronic carrier state.\r"

Six highly trained, male, distance runners twice donated a unit of RBCs, which was frozen for subsequent reinfusion. Eleven weeks after the second donation, they undertook a series of three competitive 10-km races on a standard 400-m track: before infusion, after 100 mL of saline solution, and after 400 mL of autologous, previously frozen deglycerolized RBCs. All subjects took all trials in this double-blind, placebo, crossover, experimental design. Running time was recorded at each 400-m split, and blood was collected prior to each trial. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance. Results following the RBC infusion showed a significantly higher hematocrit concentration, a significantly faster 10-km run, a nonsignificant decrease in submaximal heart rate (10 beats faster 10-km run, a nonsignificant decrease in submaximal heart rate (10 beats per minute), and no significant changes in either 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or partial pressure of oxygen at 50% hemoglobin saturation. Erythrocythemia induced by the infusion of 400 mL of autologous packed RBCs effectively increased performance capacity in a 10-km track race, probably due to an increase in oxygen delivery to the working muscles.\r"

Seven hospitals, varying with respect to size, medical school affiliation, and patient socioeconomic status participated in this study. Patterns of breast cancer care were compared with a set of branching logic standards in the form of a criteria map. A chart-based comorbidity index was developed to control for the influence of coexisting diseases on cancer management. Logistic regression analysis of 374 breast cancer cases revealed that both patient age and comorbidity status significantly and independently affected treatment. Among stage I and II patients with no or very mild comorbid disease, 96% of those aged 50 to 69 years received appropriate surgery vs 83% of patients aged 70 years and older. We conclude that physicians may manage patients with this highly treatable disease according to chronologic age without regard for physiological condition and that this age bias may result in a less favorable prognosis than could be achieved using currently recommended therapy.\r"

Ninety percent (109/121) of schools surveyed reported affiliations with a nursing home(s) for teaching, research, and/or clinical care. Most affiliations occurred in the last six years and were typically with two or more nursing homes. They were usually 120 beds or more in size, and the majority were nonprofit or Veterans Administration units. Eighty-three percent (101/121) of medical schools had teaching programs involving nursing homes. Medical school courses that utilized nursing homes as teaching sites were largely selective or elective and were offered primarily in the senior year. Training programs involving residents were usually mandatory and mainly involved the departments of internal medicine and family practice. Fifty-five percent (66/121) of the schools had research programs involving nursing homes.\r"

  ".W": "The high cost of medical professional liability is a source of growing concern among policymakers, health care consumers, and the medical profession. While the concern is widespread, to date there has been little quantitative evidence on the overall economic impact of the problem. Utilizing data from the American Medical Association's Socioeconomic Monitoring System, the impact of medical professional liability (PL) on the cost of physicians' services has been estimated employing two different methods. Both estimates indicate that the costs of PL are substantial. In particular, the two methods yield estimates of the total cost of PL in 1984 of $13.7 and $12.1 billion, respectively--or approximately 15% of the total expenditures on physicians' services. Furthermore, increased costs associated with PL from 1983 to 1984 alone are estimated under the two methods to have accounted for 63% and 57%, respectively, of the increase in expenditures on physicians' services. These costs include PL insurance premiums, costs of practice changes made in response to increasing PL risk, and costs of incurring claims that are not covered by PL insurance.\r"

Although male students consistently drank more than their female counterparts during the preclinical years, the men reduced their alcohol intake during the clinical years to converge on the lower, more consistent intake rates of their female classmates. Over the four years of medical school, 11% of the students met criteria for excessive drinking for at least one six-month period and 18% were identified as alcohol abusers by Research Diagnostic Criteria during the first two years. More than half of the excessive drinkers met abuse criteria, whereas only one third of the alcohol abusers were also excessive drinkers. Alcohol abusers had better first-year grades and better overall scores on the National Board of Medical Examiners, part I, test than their classmates. The implications of these findings for designing and implementing alcoholism intervention/prevention programs in medical schools are discussed herein.\r"

Only 21 of the total were found to be free of impairment from chemical dependence or psychiatric disease, while 920 physicians (92.0%) had a primary diagnosis of chemical dependence, and 59 (5.9%) had a major psychiatric illness. Anesthesia and family and general practice were found to be overrepresented in the population under study, as compared with all US physicians. There were significant differences between the study group and all US physicians with respect to age, sex, and practice activity status. The authors urge these apparent high-risk specialties, as well as the medical profession itself, to develop control or prevention strategies that will reduce risk for chemical dependence through education, early identification, intervention, and treatment of those individuals with the disease.\r"

Seventy-three reported serious suicidal ideation prior to sobriety, 26 after the drinking ended. Thirty-eight had made overt suicide attempts, 15 more than once. The presence of alcoholics in the nuclear family and marital instability were common. Treatment experiences varied from none other than Alcoholics Anonymous (21%) to long-term residential treatment of 15 weeks or more per episode (23%). Most had reached treatment through circumstances other than referral by therapists or intervention by impaired-physician committees.

  ".W": "In previous studies from this laboratory it has been shown that ATP-ase activity in situ in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is clearly reduced in rats rendered nephrotic after treatment with adriamycin (ADR). The question was raised whether this reduction of ATP-ase activity in the GBM is due to toxic activity of ADR or rather a result of the nephrotic condition per se. Therefore, we studied ATP-ase activity using the cerium-based method in kidneys from ADR-treated rats without proteinuria (48 hr after ADR injection), or with proteinuria (approximately 150 mg/24 hr) several weeks after ADR injection. Also kidneys from rats rendered nephrotic by surgical ablation and from non-nephrotic rats treated with local X-irradiation (2000 rads) as well as from normal control rats were studied. The results show that in the GBM of ADR-treated or irradiated rats, clear reduction of ATP-ase activity is observed irrespective of their proteinuria, whereas in the GBM of rats rendered nephrotic by renal ablation (approximately 156 mg/24 hr mean protein excretion) no reduction of enzyme activity is found. It is concluded that decreased ATP-ase activity of the glomerular filtration barrier in ADR-treated rats is due to an early toxic activity of this drug and not a result of the nephrotic state per se. In view of the identical results in X-irradiated rats, it is likely that ADR may act through production of toxic radicals leading to damage of this membrane-associated enzyme system.\r"

All studies were performed six weeks after UNX. At that time, rats receiving DOC and SALT alone were hypertensive and had significantly more proteinuria and morphologic evidence of glomerular injury than rats given vehicle and tap water which were normotensive. Antihypertensive therapy normalized mean arterial pressure in DOC-SALT rats, but failed to prevent proteinuria, mesangial expansion or focal segmental glomerular lesions. Micropuncture studies revealed that glomerular capillary pressure was elevated in both untreated and treated DOC-SALT animals. We conclude that drugs which successfully reduce systemic blood pressure may fail to correct glomerular capillary hypertension in DOC-SALT rats. As persistence of intrarenal hypertension is associated with significant glomerular injury, normalization of glomerular capillary pressure rather than systemic arterial pressure is crucial to the prevention of glomerular injury in this model.\r"

The results showed that in control rats, hemorrhagic SBP reduction to 90 mm Hg had no effect on autoregulation of RBF (autoregulatory index = 0.09 +/- 0.02), creatinine clearance, or renal histology. However, in one week NE-ARF rats with intact renal nerves, hemorrhagic reduction in SBP to 90 mm Hg was associated with marked impairment of autoregulation of RBF (autoregulatory index = 3.49 +/- 0.25), further reduction in creatinine clearance from 0.59 +/- 0.08 ml/min to 0.36 +/- 0.14 ml/min, and histologic evidence of recurrent ischemic injury. Renal denervation prior to SBP reduction improved autoregulation of RBF (autoregulatory index = 0.30 +/- 0.09), prevented the further reduction in creatinine clearance, and significantly ameliorated the deleterious effect on renal histology seen in innervated NE-ARF rats. These results suggest the potential importance of the loss of autoregulation of RBF on the course of NE-ARF, and further support the pathogenetic role of renal nerves in the loss of autoregulation.\r"

Rats were exposed to peritoneal dialysis solutions using 16 ml instillations, 30 minute cycles, and dextrose concentrations from 1.4 to 20 g%. There was a plateau in ultrafiltration per exchange at mean osmotic gradients above 360 mOsm/kg H2O near 12.5 ml/ex (0.42 ml/min). The findings are also compatible with filtration pressure equilibrium predictions at an effective capillary plasma flow of 0.84 ml/min and a filtration fraction near 50%. Studies with cardiovascular drugs (norepinephrine i.v., nitroprusside i.p., and dobutamine i.v.) showed no effects on the maximum ultrafiltration rates. This might indicate that flow is rather fixed because of known microcirculatory effects of solutions themselves.\r"

  ".W": "Aluminum (Al) accumulation in bone is associated with low bone formation and mineralization rates; resorption may also be reduced. The mechanism of these Al-induced changes was investigated using cultured mouse osteoblast-like (OB) and osteoclast-like (OC) cells. The Al effect on bone resorption was measured by the in vitro release of 45Ca and beta-glucuronidase from mouse fetal limb-bones. Al had a biphasic effect. High concentrations (greater than 1.5 X 10(-6) M) of Al inhibited collagen and DNA synthesis, ornithine decarboxylase and alkaline phosphatase activity in OB, and depressed tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in OC. Lower Al concentrations stimulated these cellular activities and 45Ca and beta-glucuronidase release from fetal bones. Al had no effect on basal cAMP levels in OB but inhibited the stimulating effect of bPTH on cAMP content. Al also altered the 1,25(OH)2D3 effects on the ornithine decarboxylase activity of OB cells. These data suggest that: (i) the low bone formation observed in vivo during Al intoxication may be due to the inhibition of collagen synthesis and to depressed cell proliferation; and (ii) Al may indirectly influence bone remodeling by interfering with the actions of bPTH and 1,25(OH)2D3 on bone cells.\r"

  ".W": "Munich-Wistar rats were studied 18 weeks following 5/6 renal ablation. In untreated group 1 rats maintained on standard chow containing 24% protein, sustained systemic and glomerular hypertension were associated with increasing proteinuria and widespread glomerular injury. In group 2, early treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril prevented systemic and glomerular hypertension, and largely limited proteinuria and glomerular injury. Groups 3 and 4 received no therapy during the first eight weeks, during which they developed systemic hypertension and levels of proteinuria previously shown to be associated with significant glomerular sclerosis at this time point. Enalapril therapy begun at eight weeks in group 3 rats reversed systemic and glomerular hypertension, prevented a further rise in proteinuria, and limited glomerular lesions at 18 weeks relative to group 1. Reduction of dietary protein content to 12% at eight weeks in group 4 rats controlled glomerular but not systemic hypertension to near-normal levels, stabilized proteinuria values, and also limited glomerular lesions at 18 weeks compared to group 1. These studies support the view that glomerular hypertension is an essential hemodynamic derangement responsible for progressive glomerular injury. Furthermore, reduction of capillary pressure can arrest the progression of remnant glomerular injury even when therapy is delayed until glomerular injury is established.\r"

Seven groups of rats were studied, and it was found that the magnitude of hypercalcemia was dose dependent. During a two hour i.v. infusion containing 0.4 mg aluminum per 100 grams of body weight, the total plasma calcium increased from 9.7 +/- 0.2 to 12.7 +/- 0.7 mg/dl (X +/- SE, P less than 0.02) while the ionized calcium decreased from 5.1 +/- 0.12 to 4.05 +/- 0.24 mg/dl (P less than 0.001). The increase in plasma calcium occurred in intact and parathyroidectomized rats, and the hypercalcemia could not be attributed to changes in PTH, arterial pH, plasma protein, or plasma phosphate. In vitro studies indicate that the addition of aluminum to rat plasma results in decreased ionized calcium concentration. Similarly, ultrafilterable calcium declined from 5.4 +/- 0.17 to 4.53 +/- 0.12 mg/dl (P less than 0.001) after the addition of aluminum to rat plasma. In summary, high levels of intravenous aluminum increase total plasma calcium and decrease ionized calcium. As also supported by in vitro data, the most probable mechanism is increased binding of calcium in the plasma which decreases ionized calcium. As a result of the decreased concentration of ionized calcium, movement of bone and interstitial calcium into the vascular space may occur, thus increasing total plasma calcium.\r"

  ".W": "Parathyroid suppression by intraperitoneal calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D3) during peritoneal dialysis. The purpose of this study was to determine if parathyroid hormone (PTH) suppression could be achieved by increasing calcium mass transfer (Ca MT) with high dialysate Ca (4 mEq/liter) or via intraperitoneal (i.p.) 1,25(OH)2D3 in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Eleven patients were dialyzed for two months with standard Ca dialysate (3.5 mEq/liter) followed by two months with 4.0 mEq/liter Ca, then by three months of i.p. 1,25(OH)2D3. During the latter period, patients were randomized to groups whose dialysate contained either 3.5 mEq/liter or 4.0 mEq/liter Ca. We found that 4.0 mEq/liter Ca dialysate more than doubled Ca MT (37 +/- 17 mg/day to 84 +/- 6 mg/day) leading to a modest fall (P less than 0.05) in PTH levels (84 +/- 5.5% of controls). Ionized calcium levels did not change. With i.p. 1,25(OH)2D3, however, ionized calcium rose significantly (P less than 0.001) leading to a decline in PTH levels to 53.9 +/- 7.9% of control values. Serum 1,25(OH)2D3 levels rose from undetectable to 47.7 +/- 7.2 pg/dl (normal range 20 to 35). These studies indicate that increasing Ca MT using a 4.0 mEq/liter Ca dialysate leads to a small reduction in PTH concentrations. On the other hand, i.p. 1,25(OH)2D3 is well absorbed into the systemic circulation, raises ionized calcium levels, and leads to a marked suppression of PTH. Thus, i.p. 1,25(OH)2D3 may be a simple and effective means to suppress secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients undergoing CAPD.\r"

High specificity of the polyclonal antibodies was verified by dot-blot analysis. Control specimens lacking immunoglobulin deposits were negative for MAC-related antigens. Markers of classical pathway activation (Clq and C4) were observed only in two of 24 and one of 23 cases of IgA-GN and HSP, respectively. Glomerular distribution patterns (mesangial vs. mesangio-peripheral) of immunoglobulin or complement deposits were correlated for IgA and C3b/iC3b (P less than 0.002), for IgA and properdin (P less than 0.002) and for IgA and MAC neoantigens (P less than 0.01). Double immunostaining experiments revealed co-localization of IgA and MAC neoantigens at identical mesangial and capillary sites. Glomerular distribution of the less pronounced IgG or IgM deposits did not correlate with that of any complement-derived antigen. The pattern of MAC-related antigens was found to be uniformly either mesangial or mesangio-peripheral. Staining for MAC-related antigens was less intense in IgA-GN cases with minimal glomerular lesions than in cases with more advanced non-sclerosing lesions. IgA, C3d, and MAC localized in corresponding glomerular sites. This is consistent with complete local activation of complement by glomerular IgA deposits via the alternative pathway. The possibility exists that MAC plays a pathogenetic role, such as by irritation of bystander cells, in IGA-GN and HSP.\r"

Surgical removal of tumors caused an average of 65% decline in reactivity at 5 days postoperative as compared to reactivity of animals with their tumors intact. Sham surgery caused an average of 33% elevation in reactivity. Macrophages added to cultures at spleen cell/macrophage ratio of 100:1 caused an average 171%, 59%, and 12% elevation in the activity of surgery, tumor-bearing, and sham-surgery animals, respectively. Surgical manipulation of tumor-bearing mice, therefore, augmented in situ the ability of spleen cells to exhibit lymphoproliferative activity to a soluble syngeneic antigenic extract in vitro, possibly by a mechanism involving the activation of macrophages and requiring the presence of a sizable antigenic load.\r"

All diagnoses were established by autopsy or thorough clinical and surgical evaluation. The diagnosis of mesothelioma was established following rigid anatomic criteria. All tissue was formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Commercially available reagents and antisera were used in all cases. Results showed a high rate of positivity for keratin and hyaluronidase-sensitive Coll Fe in the mesotheliomas while adenocarcinomas were uniformly positive for CEA and keratin and generally positive for PAS-D (diastase) and mucicarmine. Mesotheliomas were negative for CEA, mucin, and PAS-D. Positive keratin staining was also seen in the spindle cell components of mesotheliomas. Immunohistochemical stains often added significantly to our ability to establish the diagnosis of mesothelioma with confidence, since they were more frequently and more clearly positive than histochemical stains.\r"

The tumor takes from these injections were 50/50 (100%), 1/10 (10%), 10/10 (100%), and 7/12 (60%), respectively. The frequency of lung metastasis from these sites was 0, 100, 50, and 100%, respectively. At the time of host death, the flank and tail tumors were, respectively, 2.2 +/- 0.5 cm (geometric mean diameter) and 1.2 +/- 0.3 cm in the TA3Ha and 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm and 0.4 +/- 0.1 cm in the L1210 systems. TA3Ha tumors metastasized regularly to the lymph nodes but the L1210 tumors seldom metastasized to the lymph nodes. Tail implants of TA3Ha tumors behaved similarly in the athymic nude mice and strain A mice. TA3Ha cells inoculated into the Millipore chambers and maintained in mice for greater than 150 days were viable and able to form tumors. The results demonstrate that the anatomic location of the tumor affects the growth and metastatic behavior of the tumors, and that the tumors of different histologic origin metastasize differently even when grown in corresponding locations.\r"

The nuclei of invasive carcinoma cells tended to be smaller when they invaded stroma as single cells or as \"thin strands\" than when they invaded as part of large sheets of cells. Cells in direct apposition with the stroma usually had smaller nuclei than cells which were found centrally in large confluent sheets of cells. Intraduct carcinoma cells approached, in size, invasive cells which formed confluent sheets, rather than cancer cells which invaded as single cells. The nuclei of cells which invaded in small groups were usually darker than those of cells in confluent sheets, which were usually more vesicular.\r"

  ".W": "Many surgeons think that cancer causes a higher incidence of wound complications. Wound healing was examined in a cutaneous and deep model in control and sarcoma-bearing rats to evaluate this concept. In a dorsal incisional wound, a significant decrease in wound breaking strength was observed from 19 days after tumor implantation onward. The amount of the breaking strength deficit increased with the size of tumor and the day post-tumor implant. In a deeper wound chamber, hydroxyproline levels, 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA, histology, and collagen types were examined, and tumor produced no significant change in any parameter. The presence of tumor appeared to inhibit wound healing in cutaneous wounds but had no apparent effect on deeper wounds. This difference in healing in the two wound models is important to surgical oncologists. Because there is no demonstrable tumor-induced healing deficit in deep wounds, cancer-bearing organisms probably still heal these wounds normally.\r"

The majority of the literature suggests that prevention of local recurrence mandates wide (en bloc) excision. Few more than a dozen cases of primary breast fibromatosis have been reported. Herein the clinical characteristics, diagnostic evaluation, and therapeutic options are presented. Management should be based upon principles utilized for extra-mammary primary disease-en bloc resection. This may require total mastectomy and removal of pectoralis major muscle. Breast reconstruction should be deferred for a minimum of 3 years, during which time the majority of recurrences will have become manifest.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of systemic hypothermia in combination with cardiopulmonary bypass for the repair of congenital cardiac malformations is established. Surface cooling in infants with ventricular septal defects as a prebypass adjunct has been associated with visceral ischemic complications. Surface cooling in infant pigs with ventricular septal defects results in increased systemic vascular resistance and unchanged pulmonary vascular resistance with increased left-to-right shunting and a maldistribution of blood flow away from the viscera and kidneys. This study was to determine whether nitroprusside ameliorates the deleterious effects of increased systemic vascular resistance during hypothermia in infant pigs with ventricular septal defects. Nine neonatal pigs (4 weeks, 4 kg) had experimental ventricular septal defects resulting in a 2.3 +/- 0.3: 1 shunt. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were determined by the flow probe and microsphere techniques. Systemic and pulmonary blood flow distributions were measured by the microsphere technique. Left-to-right shunt ratios were determined by oximetry, flow probe, and microsphere. The pigs were cooled to 28 degrees C and measurements were made at 37 degrees, 32 degrees, and 28 degrees C. We found that nitroprusside abolishes the deleterious effects of surface cooling by blocking the rise of systemic vascular resistance without significant changes in aortic pressure. As a result, the animals maintained control pulmonary-to-systemic flow levels and maintained control levels of oxygen delivery while showing a decline in oxygen consumption. Additionally, the vasodilatory effect allowed the animals to cool twice as fast as animals without nitroprusside. Regional blood flow distribution as percent cardiac output and absolute tissue flow were protected during surface cooling. This technique may have a role in cardiac operations on infants with left-to-right shunts.\r"

  ".W": "The factors that make mitral reconstruction an attractive alternative to valve replacement are increased anatomical valve orifice, preservation of the valvular apparatus, improved longevity over porcine xenografts, and no requirement for long-term anticoagulation. In our experience the majority of patients with mitral regurgitation have degenerative valve disease. This comparative series of patients operated on over a 10 year interval includes 72 with replacement and 112 with reconstruction. The average cross-clamp times were 69 minutes for reconstruction and 44 minutes for replacement. The hospital mortalities were 3.6% and 18.1%, respectively. Postoperative valve areas as determined by Doppler echocardiography were 2.69 cm2 for replacement and 2.67 cm2 for reconstruction (p = 0.9). The valve failure rate was 2.0% per patient-year for reconstruction and there were no failures in the replacement group. The reoperation incidence for reconstruction was 20% at 10 years. The remaining patients, although clinically well, had varying degrees of stable, nonprogressive mitral regurgitation. Forty-five percent had mild to trivial regurgitation detectable by echocardiographic studies. The decision between mitral valve reconstruction and mitral valve replacement remains a highly controversial issue. The failure of our data to demonstrate superior valve function for patients with mitral regurgitation undergoing valve reconstruction suggests a need for careful analysis of reconstruction with respect to effective valve orifice and incidence of regurgitation.\r"

Between January 1965 and September 1985 41 closed mitral valvotomies with a Tubbs dilator were performed in 39 pregnant women (two first trimester, 22 second trimester, and 17 third trimester). All patients experienced symptomatic improvement from New York Heart Association Class 3.01 (average) preoperatively to 1.22 postoperatively. There were no deaths related to the operation and delivery. Fetal deaths were due to postoperative spontaneous abortion in two cases (4.9%) or premature labour in three cases (7.3%), for an overall survival of 36 babies (87.8%). Fetal morbidity was due to prematurity or dismaturity in three infants, all of whom survived. Thirty-three normal infants were delivered at term. Nine patients needed subsequent surgical procedures for mitral valve restenosis 5 to 17 years (mean 10.2 years) after the initial closed valvotomy: Repeat closed valvotomy was performed in three patients after 5, 8, and 10 years (the first two during subsequent pregnancies), an open procedure was performed in one after 6 years, and five patients underwent subsequent mitral valve replacement after 11 (two), 12 (two), and 17 (one) years. Two late deaths occurred; one after 10 years, as a result of pneumonia and meningitis, and the other after 12 years, before a mitral valve replacement for restenosis could be performed. None of the remaining patients has required further surgical procedures, but two have moderate symptoms. Closed mitral valvotomy gives satisfactory results in pregnant patients with severe mitral stenosis. When indicated during pregnancy, it should be performed at any stage of the pregnancy.\r"

The preoperative cineangiograms of all patients were reviewed to measure left ventricular ejection fraction and to quantitatively assess right ventricular function by measuring the percentage reduction in right ventricular midcavity diameter. There were 23 early deaths (within 30 days) and 14 late deaths occurring between 1 and 92 months after operation. Of the 23 long-term survivors, 87% are in New York Heart Association Class I or II. The early mortality was significantly higher for inferior infarction (58%) than for anterior infarction (25%). Early mortality was also influenced by the time interval between infarction and operation (under 1 week 41%, over 4 weeks 22%). Early survival was favored by good preoperative right ventricular function; the percentage reduction in right ventricular midcavity diameter was 16.5% +/- 9.5% (mean +/- standard deviation) for the early death group and 26.7% +/- 10.6% for the early survival group. However, the early outcome was not influenced by left ventricular function before operation. Conversely, long-term survival was favored by preserved preoperative left ventricular function; left ventricular ejection fraction was 26.2% +/- 9.3% for the late death group and 35% +/- 8.5% for the late survival group. Long-term survival was not, however, affected by right ventricular function before operation. The results of surgical closure of postinfarction ventricular septal defect have improved between two successive time frames in this series, which is the largest to date.\r"

This study was undertaken to document the sequential events leading to this regeneration. Therefore, polyurethane/poly-L-lactic acid vascular grafts were implanted into the abdominal aorta of rats (N = 28) and were harvested at regular intervals from 1 hour up to 12 weeks after implantation. The implants were evaluated by means of light and electron microscopy. At each time of harvesting, the implants were patent and showed arterial pulsations. No stenosis or dilatation was observed. Endothelial cells grew from the adjacent aortic intima across the anastomoses, from day 6 onward, to form an almost complete neointima after 6 weeks of implantation. Smooth muscle cells also grew from the adjacent aortic media over the graft lattice through the platelet-fibrin coagulum from day 6 onward. The smooth muscle cells, predominantly longitudinally arranged at week 6, but also circularly arranged in some areas at week 12, formed a neomedia in which elastic laminae regenerated. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes initially invaded the graft lattices. Fibroblasts, histiocytes, and capillaries grew from the perigraft tissue into the polyurethane/poly-L-lactic acid lattices from day 6 onward, which resulted in the formation of a neoadventitia. The polyurethane/poly-L-lactic acid lattices started to disintegrate from day 12 onward. The regenerative processes in the disintegrating polyurethane/poly-L-lactic acid grafts resulted in the formation of neoarteries, which were of sufficient strength, compliance, and thromboresistance to function as small-caliber arterial substitutes.\r"

Thirty-one patients with encapsulated thymoma were treated with total surgical resection alone, and they had no postoperative tumor recurrence. With the exception of one patient who died of respiratory insufficiency on the fourth day after the operation, 34 patients with invasive thymoma were evaluated on the basis of their postoperative prognosis. Fifteen patients with invasive thymoma died from 1 1/2 months to 10 years, 1 month postoperatively; 9 died of local or metastatic tumor and 6 died of other diseases. Associated autoimmune diseases, as well as the invasive tendency of the tumors, apparently affected the prognosis. Ten-year survival rates of the patients who underwent surgical treatment were as follows: 61.6% for the total group, 74.3% for those with encapsulated thymoma, and 49.4% for those with invasive thymoma. In the surgical treatment for invasive thymomas, one should aim to resect the tumor totally, even though adjacent tissues are resected simultaneously. Even for the patient with total resection of invasive tumor, postoperative radiation should be required. Finally, if residual tumor must be left during the operation, postoperative radiation as well as anticancer chemotherapy should be aggressively scheduled, because postoperative distant metastasis may appear in these patients with residual thymoma.\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that pulsatile blood flow helps to preserve the myocardium after ischemia. However, its effect on postischemic myocardium during cardiopulmonary bypass has not been clearly defined. To determine if pulsatile reperfusion improves postischemic recovery of cardiac metabolism and performance, we subjected 20 dogs to 60 minutes of aortic cross-clamping followed by 45 minutes of pulsatile (P group; 10 dogs) or nonpulsatile (NP group; 10 dogs) reperfusion. Left ventricular function was measured at a controlled preload in both groups before induction of global ischemia and after termination of bypass. Segmental length (assessed by sonomicrometry) was used to determine dimensional changes. Ventricular pressures were measured with solid-state micromanometers. Percent recovery of left ventricular peak systolic pressure, its first derivative, and stroke work were 66%, 59%, and 38%, respectively in the NP group and 82%, 76%, and 65% in the P group. The postarrest decrease in segmental shortening was minimized in the P group; left ventricular function curves and the slope of the end-systolic pressure-length relationship also indicated better performance after pulsatile reperfusion than after nonpulsatile reperfusion. Myocardial lactate extraction was transiently improved during the early pulsatile reperfusion period. We conclude that pulsatile reperfusion provides better myocardial preservation than nonpulsatile perfusion after 60 minutes of induced global ischemia.\r"

The correlation of myocardial oxygen consumption with this stroke work could provide an integrated measure of cardiac performance and metabolism to assess perturbations induced by ischemia or pathologic loading conditions. Fourteen canine hearts instrumented for computerized acquisition of instantaneous pressure-volume data and quantitation of myocardial oxygen consumption were studied during progressive volume infusion on right heart bypass (1.5 to 3.5 L/min in 250 ml/min increments). Data acquisition both in the control state and during continuous infusion of calcium chloride (0.03 mEq/kg/min, n = 7) to increase contractility or phenylephrine (2 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7) to alter afterload facilitated the construction of stroke work versus end-diastolic volume and myocardial oxygen consumption versus stroke work relationships by least-squares regression analysis. The cardiac mechanics assessment for this group of dogs confirmed a highly linear (mean r = 0.984) work versus preload relationship that was unaffected by changes in afterload but sensitive to increased contractility (71% increase in slope). The myocardial energetics correlation was also linear (mean r = 0.939) and demonstrated an increased oxygen utilization characteristic of the higher inotropic state produced by calcium chloride infusion (0.047 +/- 0.003 versus 0.070 +/- 0.008 ml oxygen/beat/100 gm left ventricular weight, p = 0.008). Although phenylephrine administration produced variable perturbations of myocardial oxygen consumption, the energetics relationship for this subgroup was not statistically altered by changes in afterload. The features of this cardiac energetics assessment suggest its value as a biological marker to evaluate the postischemic, hypertrophied, or failing heart.\r"

The viability, as evaluated by an autoradiographic technique, was similar in both aortic and pulmonary specimens at the time of dissection, after 2 weeks, and after 4 weeks of storage. The histologic examination showed no changes in the structure of the media in all samples up to 4 weeks of storage. The total calcium content per gram of tissue in the pulmonary media was on an average less than half of that in the aortic counterpart. We conclude that the pulmonary homograft is preserved the same as the aortic homograft and, accordingly, it becomes available for clinical application. Moreover, a lesser content of elastic tissue and a lower amount of total calcium may, in all likelihood, make the pulmonary wall less prone to calcification.\r"

The study group was composed of 51 fetal lambs including 29 models of pulmonary artery stenosis and 22 control lambs. Gestational age was 89 days at creation of pulmonary artery stenosis. Fourteen fetal lambs (Group A) were studied after creation of the stenosis at 131 days of gestation and compared to normal age-matched control lambs. The systolic right ventricular pressure was significantly higher after creation of pulmonary artery stenosis (76.6 +/- 17.8 versus 50.3 +/- 23.5 mm Hg), but the systolic pulmonary artery pressure was unchanged. The mean right ventricular weight and the mean right ventricular/left ventricular weight ratio were significantly greater after pulmonary artery stenosis than in normal control animals. The transverse myocyte diameter was not modified by pulmonary artery stenosis, but on electron microscopic study the myocytes appeared mature. Ten lambs (Group B) underwent intrauterine repair of pulmonary artery stenosis at 131 days of gestation without cardiopulmonary bypass. The pulmonary artery was clamped and patched. Immediately after repair the right ventricular pressure fell significantly from 85.8 +/- 18.9 to 62.2 +/- 14.6 mm Hg. At birth, 7 +/- 6 days after repair, Group B was compared to Group C (unrepaired pulmonary artery stenosis, five fetuses) and to normal control lambs. The mean right ventricular weight and the mean right ventricular/left ventricular weight ratio were not statistically different in Group B and in the control group. There were no ultrastructural changes after intrauterine repair. We conclude that intrauterine creation of pulmonary artery stenosis causes right ventricular hypertrophy with more mature myocytes. Intrauterine repair of pulmonary artery stenosis is feasible without cardiopulmonary bypass and rapidly abolishes the preponderance of right ventricular weight over left ventricular weight.\r"

  ".W": "Methods of palliating critical pulmonary oligemia in neonates with complex cyanotic congenital heart disease continue to evolve. Pulmonary artery distortion and other complications of the use of native vessels to increase pulmonary blood flow has led to the more frequent use of polytetrafluoroethylene shunts either in a central position or as a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. Central aorta-pulmonary artery shunts have largely fallen into disfavor because of previously reported unacceptably high incidences of complications such as shunt thrombosis, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary artery distortion. This report details our experience palliating 23 neonates with pulmonary atresia or severe pulmonary stenosis by placing central aorta-pulmonary artery shunts utilizing a short segment (less than 1 cm) of polytetrafluoroethylene. Although three of the 23 died postoperatively, none of the 23 patients had evidence of shunt thrombosis. Congestive heart failure, a potential complication of any pulmonary artery shunt, was present in eight of the 20 survivors but did not require shunt takedown and was readily controlled by digoxin. Repeat catheterization was performed in 12 patients; pulmonary angiography showed good growth of both pulmonary arteries and there was no evidence of pulmonary artery hypertension. Although minor pulmonary artery distortion was present in two patients, this distortion was centrally located and easily remedied at the time of total correction. Thus we have found the central aorta-pulmonary artery shunt to be an extremely effective and reliable means of palliating pulmonary artery hypoplasia as a result of pulmonary atresia or severe pulmonary stenosis in neonates.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular wall stress and contractile function were determined by echocardiographic methods in 11 patients studied 0.7 to 13.8 years (mean +/- standard error of the mean = 5.6 +/- 1.2 years) after undergoing the Rastelli operation for transposition of the great arteries associated with ventricular septal defect and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Age at operation ranged from 4.6 to 11.3 years (mean +/- standard error of the mean = 7.4 +/- 0.7 years). Data were compared with data of 24 normal subjects of similar age and heart rate. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and end-diastolic volume were significantly higher than normal, averaging 134% +/- 8% of normal dimension (p less than 0.004) and 106 +/- 13 ml/m2 versus a normal volume of 60 +/- 3 ml/m2) (p less than 0.007). In addition left ventricular wall mass was 215 +/- 40 gm/m2 versus a normal value of 72 + 6 gm/m2 (p less than 0.004). Both meridional and circumferential end-systolic and peak systolic stress values were not significantly different between normal subjects and Rastelli patients. Estimates of ventricular pump function including shortening fraction, rate-corrected velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, and ejection fraction were all depressed when compared with normal values. Velocity of fiber shortening, evaluated as a function of end-systolic stress, demonstrated abnormal contractile function in eight of 11 (73%) patients. These data indicate that left ventricular function is usually abnormal and residual left ventricular dilation and wall hypertrophy remain despite successful use of the Rastelli operation for repair in patients with transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\r"

Our experience in two cases proved that the peripheral pulmonary arteries could be exposed up to the segmental branches by dissection from the pulmonary hilum through a lateral thoracotomy without damaging the lung parenchyma. The stenotic areas could then be repaired with either a bifurcated or trifurcated pericardial patch.\r"

  ".W": "There is currently a renewed interest in the use of both fresh and commercially available frozen homograft valves for children and young adults. This has prompted us to review a series of 32 patients who received frozen homograft valves for aortic replacement between 1973 and 1975. The cryogenic technique evolved to include the use of selected antibiotics and equilibrated dimethyl sulfoxide solution to freeze homografts at a rate of 1 degrees C per minute to liquid nitrogen temperatures of -196 degrees C. Histologic sections of experimental frozen valves explanted 6 months postoperatively revealed the presence of viable donor cells, and tissue culture demonstrated the reproductive capacity of cusp fibroblasts. Of the 32 frozen viable homografts implanted in this series, 23 were inserted as free-sewn aortic replacements and nine were premounted on stents before implantation in the aortic position. There were two operative deaths, and three valves failed as a result of the technical problems of mounting in one patient and surgical insertion of a free graft in two patients. Of the 22 patients who remained at long-term risk, 13% with free-sewn grafts and 57% with premounted valves underwent reoperation for valve failure. After 10 years of follow-up, 15 (68%) of these patients, 12 (80%) with free-sewn and three (43%) with premounted valves, are alive with their original valve in place. Actuarial analysis shows that 58% of the 32 valves implanted are functional at the beginning of the eleventh year. There have been six late deaths resulting in an overall actuarial patient survival rate of 79% at 10 years and 69% after 13 years. These clinical results are believed to add support to our current application of the frozen homograft in selected patients.\r"

Lipopolysaccharide concentrations were low and stable until institution of cardiopulmonary bypass (preanesthetic concentration 0.128 +/- 0.032 ng/ml [mean +/- standard error of the mean]; prebypass level 0.136 +/- 0.03 ng/ml). After the start of bypass, the plasma concentration of lipopolysaccharide rose progressively with time to a mean value of 0.347 +/- 0.044 ng/ml (p less than 0.01), which was 0.227 ng/ml above baseline. Upon release of the aortic clamp, an additional rise in lipopolysaccharide concentration occurred after to 5 to 15 minutes to a mean value of 0.428 +/- 0.06 ng/ml (p less than 0.001) above baseline. The concentration then decayed to the baseline level 45 to 75 minutes after termination of bypass. The peak lipopolysaccharide concentration above the baseline positively correlated with both the length of bypass (r = 0.839, p less than 0.005) and the duration of aortic cross-clamping (y = 0.0030X + 0.173 r = 0.85, p less than 0.001) when flow was nonpulsatile. The peak occurred during the period of myocardial and pulmonary reperfusion. This rise in endotoxin concentration may be one of the factors responsible for the prolonged postoperative recovery seen in some patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the calcium and oxygen contents of a hyperkalemic glucose-containing cardioplegic solution on myocardial preservation was examined in the isolated working rat heart. The cardioplegic solution was delivered at 4 degrees C every 15 minutes during 2 hours of arrest, maintaining a myocardial temperature of 8 degrees +/- 2 degrees C. Hearts were reperfused in the Langendorff mode for 15 minutes and then resumed the working mode for a further 30 minutes. Groups of hearts were given the oxygenated cardioplegic solution containing an ionized calcium concentration of 0, 0.25, 0.75, or 1.25 mmol/L or the same solution nitrogenated to reduce the oxygen content and containing 0 or 0.75 mmol ionized calcium per liter. The myocardial adenosine triphosphate concentrations at the end of arrest in these six groups of hearts were 15.6 +/- 1.2, 9.5 +/- 0.5, 8.2 +/- 1.1, 4.9 +/- 1.8, 10.1 +/- 2.0, and 1.6 +/- 0.4 nmol/mg dry weight, respectively. At 5 minutes of working reperfusion, the percentages of prearrest aortic flow were 80 +/- 2, 62 +/- 4, 33 +/- 6, 37 +/- 5, 48 +/- 7 and 46 +/- 8, respectively. The differences among the groups in adenosine triphosphate concentrations and in functional recovery diminished during reperfusion. In hearts given the hypoxic calcium-containing solution, there was a marked increase in coronary vascular resistance during the administration of successive doses of cardioplegic solution, which was rapidly reversible upon reperfusion. These data indicate that hearts given the acalcemic oxygenated solution had better adenosine triphosphate preservation during arrest and better functional recovery than hearts in any other group. Addition of calcium to the oxygenated cardioplegic solution decreased adenosine triphosphate preservation and functional recovery. Oxygenation of the acalcemic solution increased adenosine triphosphate preservation and functional recovery. The lowest adenosine triphosphate levels at end arrest were observed in hearts given the hypoxic calcium-containing solution. In the setting of hypothermia and multidose administration, the addition of calcium to a cardioplegic solution resulted in increased energy depletion during arrest and depressed recovery.\r"

This was compared to our routine method of postoperative analgesia of intravenous morphine 2 mg/2 hr and as needed in another 30 patients (Group A). Continuous epidural morphine infusion required occasional supplementation with intravenous morphine and achieved effective analgesia in 80% of the patients. Pain relief was adequate in 50% of the patients in Group A. The mean dose of morphine used in Group B during the first 3 postoperative days was 5 mg per patient per day and was significantly lower than that used in Group A (mean 18 mg per patient per day). Serum morphine was undetectable (below 2.5 ng/ml) in Group B and was significantly lower than that in Group A (17 ng/ml). Epidural analgesia was associated with adequate postoperative pulmonary and cardiovascular functions; nausea and vomiting occurred in two patients. Levels of postoperative stress, serum cortisol, and beta-endorphin were significantly lower in Group B than in Group A. This study shows that continuous epidural infusion of morphine at a rate of 0.1 mg/hr provides selective and effective pain relief and reduces postoperative stress after cardiac operations. This method of analgesia was also associated with minimal side effects and provides an alternate approach for treatment of pain after cardiac operations.\r"

For the aortic valve replacement subgroup, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left ventricular systolic pressure, prior cardiac operation, body surface area, and cardiac index were related to operative mortality. In the mitral valve replacement group, there was a strong association of operative mortality with advanced age, exertional dizziness, reduced cardiac index, left ventricular contraction grade, ST segment depression on the resting electrocardiogram, and pleural effusion. The risk of operative death for an individual patient undergoing aortic or mitral valve replacement may be estimated with the use of independent risk factors.\r"

In this study, we evaluated the postoperative results in these 81 patients. There were no operative or late deaths. Seventy-seven patients (95%) are in Functional Class I or II. Three patients required reoperation 3, 30, and 50 months after the initial procedure because of moderate or severe residual mitral regurgitation. After valvotomy there were four episodes of embolism. The actuarial rate of freedom from any complication (mortality, reoperation, congestive heart failure, and thromboembolic events) was 89.3% +/- 3.9% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) 8 years after operation. We conclude that for a follow-up period of 8 years, the stenotic mitral valve with anatomical deformities can be salvaged with satisfactory results. Therefore, we believe that this approach, at present, is a better alternative than prosthetic replacement with any type of valve presently available.\r"

In this report, we describe the case histories of four patients with previously diagnosed amiodarone pulmonary toxicity in whom the adult respiratory distress syndrome developed after cardiothoracic operations for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Three patients underwent endocardial resection (two died), and a fourth patient had implantation of an automatic defibrillator unit. Radiographic changes and results of pulmonary function testing are evaluated during initial toxicity and preoperatively. These four patients (mean amiodarone dosage of 420 mg/day for 20 months) are compared to 13 other patients undergoing cardiothoracic operations with prior amiodarone treatment (one patient with preoperative pulmonary toxicity) in whom life-threatening postoperative pulmonary complications did not develop (mean dosage of 550 mg/day for 10 months). Mean preoperative serum amiodarone levels for the four patients were 1.5 micrograms/ml. In the two patients who died, desethylamiodarone levels were 510 and 4,400 micrograms/gm in pulmonary tissue. Histologic examination showed \"honeycomb\" appearance of the lung with prominent septae, alveolar foamy macrophages, and hyperplasia of alveolar lining cells, consistent with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Causes including pump-oxygenator time, oxygen toxicity, anesthetic agents, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary infection superimposed on amiodarone pulmonary toxicity are discussed with a review of the literature.\r"

All patients underwent electrophysiologic study before discharge and 6 months postoperatively.

Ninety-three percent have no supraventricular tachycardia and no demonstrable reentrant pathway at electrophysiologic study. All free wall accessory atrioventricular connections were divided and 97.7% of the patients were cured. Ninety percent of patients with posterior septal accessory atrioventricular connections had a satisfactory result, with cure demonstrated at late electrophysiologic study in 84%. Fifteen patients with atrioventricular junctional reentrant tachycardia were all cured, with preservation of normal atrioventricular conduction. Eight (88%) of nine patients with right atrial tachycardia were cured, and two patients with nodoventricular fibers and one patient with incessant atrioventricular junctional tachycardia had satisfactory results.

Their ages ranged from 2.5 months to 57 years (mean 52.9 +/- 104.2 months). The ventricular septal defect was closed through the right atrium and tricuspid valve in 60 patients and via the pulmonary artery in one patient with a subpulmonary defect. A pulmonary arteriotomy was made in 38 patients to expose the stenotic pulmonary valve for valvotomy and to begin the infundibular mobilization and resection. It was extended through a small pulmonary anulus primarily in 15 patients and secondarily in one, a minimal distance upon the right ventricular infundibulum to enlarge the outflow tract to 2 standard deviations larger than the mean normal pulmonary valve anulus diameter. There were no hospital or late deaths or reoperations among the entire group. The mean postrepair peak right ventricular/left ventricular pressure measured in the operating room was 0.52 +/- 0.165 for the entire group of 61 patients which indicates similar relief of pulmonary stenosis to that obtained by the classical transventricular repair. At follow-up between 2.3 and 53.8 months (mean 22.6) each patient was in New York Heart Association Class I and without cardiac medication. Postoperative cardiac catheterization studies performed in nine patients between 4 and 28 months after operation showed no residual ventricular septal defects and a mean peak right/left ventricular pressure of 0.42 +/- 0.13. This series indicates that successful repair of tetralogy of Fallot can be accomplished in most patients by a transatrial-transpulmonary approach, which may provide improved right ventricular function over the long term.\r"

A total of 22 aortic and six mitral standard-profile valves failed in this way. Twenty-five of these valves were reassessed and are the subject of this paper. Twenty-eight holes and 56 cusp tears occurred in these valves in locations which, along with coexistent pathologic findings, suggested that the cusp commissural suture/alignment stitch was the point of their origin. The importance of this observation and postulation about the genesis of these cases of valve failure lies in the potential for improvement of this valve's performance by modifications of its manufacture.\r"

  ".W": "The heterogeneity of DNA ploidy patterns within individual colorectal carcinomas was investigated by analyzing 261 different samples from 30 fresh colorectal cancers. The results of DNA analysis of multiple superficial cup biopsy specimens, of multiple full-thickness fresh tumor slices, and of nuclei extracted from paraffin-embedded pathologic archival specimens with use of the Hedley technique were compared. The same DNA ploidy pattern was found in all specimens of 19 (63%) of the 30 tumors studied. Minimal heterogeneity for DNA ploidy pattern was noted in seven carcinomas (23%), and moderate to marked heterogeneity was found in an additional four tumors (13%). The DNA pattern of a full-thickness specimen from 79% of the carcinomas studied was the same when samples were obtained from any one of five possible sites. In addition, the DNA ploidy pattern of the majority of the carcinomas could have been accurately predicted by flow cytometric DNA analysis of superficial cup biopsy specimens. These results demonstrate that most colorectal carcinomas are DNA ploidy homogeneous. Therefore, measurement of this tumor property can be used in future clinical research studies with some degree of confidence.\r"

At the initiation of dialysis, 50% of all patients were rehabilitated or caring for themselves, and the three variables that most influenced the initial rehabilitation score were age, diabetic status, and sex. Initial functional status was also analyzed for three cohorts of dialysis patients, grouped according to outcome (renal transplantation, continued dialysis, and death). Patients who received a renal transplant had initial rehabilitation scores that were higher than those who underwent dialysis for 2 years or those who died. In the group of patients who underwent dialysis for 2 years, a statistically significant improvement in rehabilitation scores was noted at 2 years in comparison with the scores obtained at the initiation of dialysis. Initial rehabilitation scores were good predictors of the 2-year scores. Of the patients in the 2-year dialysis cohort, 78% maintained or had improvement in their functional status.\r"

Of these 128 rheumatoid factor-negative serum samples, only 54 (42%) continued to produce fluorescence after the IgG was removed by the Sephadex column (yielding a theoretical 1:10 dilution) and the samples were retested for IgM (confirming test). Of the 54 specimens that were positive on both the screening and confirming IgM IFA assays, 53 (98%) had titers of 1:80 or more. Of the 74 sera that were negative on the confirming test, only 10 (14%) had titers of 1:80 on the initial screening test, and none was greater than 1:80. Immunoglobulin measurements of eight serum samples before and after column treatment indicated excellent IgG removal but poor IgM recovery (a mean loss of 85% of the total IgM). Comparison of the time needed to detect IgM in CMV culture-positive patients demonstrated an increase from 17.1 to 28.3 days (serum tested by IFA before and after column separation, respectively). Therefore, confirmation of anti-CMV IgM in serum specimens by QAE-Sephadex A50 column chromatography seems to be of low sensitivity.\r"

In 11 patients (10.6%), the CKB increased to abnormally high levels within 4 hours after the radiographic procedures, and the median value after 30 minutes was significantly higher than the corresponding precontrast value (P less than 0.01). Eight of the 11 patients had recent ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, and 7 of the 11 had undergone CT scanning. On the basis of the information available in the literature, elevation of the serum CKB levels may be interpreted as reflecting breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and neural damage. Intravascularly administered radiographic media are generally safe, but the results of the current investigation suggested the potential for detrimental effects, particularly in patients with recent cerebrovascular diseases.\r"

With measurements of flow, volume, and pressure, a more precise quantitative evaluation of the respiratory system can be obtained than with clinical assessment alone. In this article, we discuss the principles, techniques, and clinical applications of measurements of respiratory system mechanics in ventilated patients and suggest directions for further research that may prove to be clinically relevant.\r"

  ".W": "Radioimmunoassays for human calcitonin in whole plasma are limited in sensitivity and specificity; basal values of calcitonin are often undetectable in normal plasma, and nonspecific increases are occasionally found in seemingly healthy persons. We avoided these problems by applying a silica-cartridge extraction-concentration technique for calcitonin assay, and the effectiveness of two calcitonin stimulation tests in healthy volunteers and patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma was compared. The radioimmunoassay was improved by using a new antiserum and a sequential incubation procedure that reduced the previously used sample-volume requirement and incubation period substantially. This method was used to measure mean basal plasma levels of calcitonin (+/-SD) in 45 normal men (8.2 +/- 5 pg/ml) and 47 normal women (4.8 +/- 4 pg/ml) (P less than 0.001). Calcium infusions (2 mg/kg over 5 minutes) in 18 normal men and 37 normal women yielded a significantly greater secretory response than did pentagastrin (0.5 micrograms/kg as a bolus). Among 12 patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma, pentagastrin seemed to be a better secretagogue than calcium (P less than 0.001). We recommend routine measurement of plasma silica-extractable calcitonin and pentagastrin injection as the provocative test of choice for the detection and management of medullary thyroid carcinoma. The short calcium-infusion test is a good alternative.\r"

Preoperatively, the prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, or platelet count was abnormal in 45 of the 235 patients (19%), a significantly higher incidence than that expected in a normal population (P less than 0.002). Prolonged values for the prothrombin time or the partial thromboplastin time or activated partial thromboplastin time were seen most frequently. Further evaluation in eight of the patients with prolonged prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin or activated partial thromboplastin time showed decreased levels of either factor VII or IX in six of them, suggesting that impaired vitamin K-dependent carboxylation is commonly present. Normal results of preoperative coagulation tests do not exclude the presence of a major bleeding diathesis (von Willebrand's disease was later diagnosed in a patient with such findings). The use of blood products during subsequent cardiac operations was not significantly different in patients with normal or abnormal test results. Two of the three patients who required reoperation and were found to have a nonsurgical cause of bleeding had abnormalities in two or more of the preoperative coagulation tests. This finding suggests that abnormal results of preoperative coagulation tests may be predictive of defective hemostasis in the postoperative period.\r"

Furthermore, the recovery time for this blood culture method was less than that for a conventional blood culture method (brain-heart infusion biphasic technique). The lysis-centrifugation blood culture technique is an important laboratory method for the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis.\r"

Results indicated that simulated paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve or combined paralysis of the recurrent and superior laryngeal nerves produced a diminished mucosal wave bilaterally, with loss of the two-mass system of vibration and diminished lateral excursion of the normal cord. In contrast, simulated paralysis of the superior laryngeal nerve was characterized by an abnormally exaggerated vertical movement of the paralyzed cord in relation to the normal cord and a horizontal shifting of the glottis from the paralyzed to the normal side during each vibratory cycle.

  ".W": "A human squamous carcinoma cell line (P3) was first exposed to a nontoxic dose of Rhodamine-123 (1 microgram/ml for 1 hour), then subjected to treatment with a single mode argon laser at 514.5 nm. The temperature and energy levels delivered to the target cells were determined by a reproducible method of dosimetry. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test. Cell duplication and DNA synthesis were measured by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine at 6 and 24 hours post-treatment. The results indicate that Rhodamine-123 at nontoxic doses of 1 microgram/ml enhanced the tumoricidal effects of the argon laser at reduced temperatures as low as 40 degrees C. Furthermore, at physiological temperature ranges as low as 28 to 39 degrees C, an immediate and/or delayed inhibition of cell duplication was demonstrated, while cell viability was not affected. These observations, suggest that Rhodamine-123 can be used effectively as a chemosensitizing agent in the treatment of human tumor cells with the argon laser at 514.5 nm. This new technique of tumor cell targeting by Rhodamine sensitization and specific laser treatment may offer real advantages without the extreme photosensitivity associated with hematoporphyrin derivatives.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical trauma to the lateral semicircular canal (LSC) is a rare complication which does not always result in cochlear damage. The authors present six such cases, discuss the histopathological findings of one case, and review 12 previous reports. Transient cochlear depression with normalization of function within 6 weeks of trauma occurred in most instances. Vestibular symptoms were pronounced and, although compensation was not delayed, positional dizziness and instability usually persisted for several months and occasionally for a year or more. Histopathological findings (two specimens) were significant for obliterative scarring of the LSC at the site of injury and for the structural integrity of the labyrinth and cochlea. The mechanism of cochlear protection in these cases remains obscure; however, clean injuries away from the ampullary end of the canal occurring in patients without preexisting inner ear disease appear to have a better prognosis. Intraoperative closure of the defect, postoperative bed rest, and antibiotics are the basic elements of management.\r"

All subjects tested at baseline evaluations had normal VOR function. During aminoglycoside therapy there was a precipitous drop in both the VOR time and gain constants. The decline in VOR function was larger at lower stimulus frequencies compared to high frequencies, resulting in a relative preservation of function in the high frequencies. Over a period of about a year, VOR high frequency gains recovered to within normal limits. However, the VOR time constants showed only a modest recovery and remained well below the normal range.\r"

A review of the literature revealed 12 children, ages 2 months to 21 years, who have been described with this problem. Two additional patients are reported here. In children the male:female ratio is 1:1, whereas in adults a 2:1 male preponderance is seen. Diabetes mellitus, present in 94.7% of adults, is seen in only 21% of children. Facial nerve paralysis occurs in 35% of the children as compared to 52% of the adults. Facial paralysis was permanent in 100% of the children, but only 36.3% of the surviving adults had permanent facial paralysis. Surgical intervention had no significant effect on either group. Other pediatric complications include external auditory canal stenosis (29%), auricular cartilage deformity (11%), and sensorineural hearing loss (18%). A 40% to 50% mortality rate is seen in adults whereas no deaths have been reported in children. The clinical presentation of necrotizing external otitis in children shares some features with the disease as described in adults. However, notable differences do exist and form the basis of this report. The proposed pathophysiology of necrotizing external otitis in adults and its significance for disease in children are also discussed.\r"

Four linear measurements were individually correlated with these areas. Two of these lines had excellent correlation with the sinus area and if either of these lines exceeds a calculated value, the sinus area exceeds the 99th percentile of the normal population and can be considered abnormally enlarged. This technique provides a rapid, easy, and reliable method for assessing abnormally enlarged frontal sinus areas.\r"

In this condition there is generalized enlargement of the sinus beyond the upper limit of normal in an asymptomatic patient.

The clinical history and physical findings were most important in differential diagnosis. Patient age, lateral neck x-ray, and white blood count (WBC) strongly correlated with diagnosis. Counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) results did not alter therapy. No blood cultures were positive unless the patient had: WBC over 15,000 with more than 10 stabs, WBC over 20,000, or WBC with more than 20 stabs. Ampicillin resistant H. influenzae occurred in 21% of positive blood cultures. Capillary blood gases did not correlate with clinical need for intubation.

Some patients present with frontal sinus damage along with intracranial pathology that requires craniotomy for treatment of the intracranial problem. In these patients, the neurosurgeon typically performs a bifrontal scalp flap to expose the cranium. A bone flap that transects the superior margin of the frontal sinus is then elevated and removed. This allows direct visualization of the anterior and posterior sinus walls and both nasofrontal ducts, subsequently facilitating reduction of fractures, debridement, and obliteration or ablation, if necessary, without creating another bone flap. The surgeon gets an overall picture of the sinus without the added trauma associated with the creation of an osteoplastic flap.\r"

  ".W": "The propagation of light energy in tissues is an important problem in phototherapy, especially with the increased use of lasers as light sources. Often a slight difference in delivered energy separates a useless, efficacious, or disastrous treatment. Methods are presented for experimental characterization of the optical properties of a tissue and computational prediction of the distribution of light energy within a tissue. A standard integrating sphere spectrophotometer measured the total transmission, Tt, total reflectance, Rt, and the on-axis transmission, Ta, for incident collimated light that propagated through the dermis of albino mouse skin, over the visible spectrum. The diffusion approximation solution to the one-dimensional (1-D) optical transport equation computed the expected Tt and Rt for different combinations of absorbance, k, scattering, s, and anisotropy, g, and by iterative comparison of the measured and computed Tt and Rt values converged to the intrinsic tissue parameters. For example, mouse dermis presented optical parameters of 2.8 cm-1, 239 cm-1, and 0.74 for k, s, and g, respectively, at 488 nm wavelength. These values were used in the model to simulate the optical propagation of the 488-nm line of an argon laser through mouse skin in vivo. A 1-D Green's function thermal diffusion model computed the temperature distribution within the tissue at different times during laser irradiation. In vitro experiments showed that the threshold temperature range for coagulation was 60 degrees-70 degrees C, and the kinetics were first order, with a temperature-dependent rate constant that obeyed an Arrhenius relation (molar entropy 276 cal/mol-degrees K, molar enthalpy 102 kcal/mol). The model simulation agreed with the corresponding in vivo experiment that a 2-s pulse at 55 W/cm2 irradiance will achieve coagulation of the skin.\r"

The breakdown probability per laser pulse has been found to depend exponentially on the reciprocal laser field. This indicates that, as in transparent solids, electron avalanche ionization is likely the main mechanism for optical breakdown in liquids. Shielding of the retina, by the laser-induced plasma, is not very effective, but an appreciable degree of shielding is present, in burst operation, even after membrane disruption. A backscattered beam, which presents the typical properties of stimulated Brillouin scattering, has been observed in the eye model, with a threshold of approximately 5 X 10(9) W/cm2. This beam, which presents an irregular spatial structure with peaks of irradiance well above the average value, may produce damage of the internal wall of the cornea.\r"

  ".W": "The exact mechanism of irradiation-induced occlusion of normal or abnormal retinal vessels is still to a large extent obscure. Blood flow acts as a powerful heat dissipation mechanism. Therefore, a procedure which reduces flow velocity as rapidly as possible after the beginning of irradiation may work with higher efficiency. A theory based on a simplified assumption states that vessel narrowing techniques, which involve only a short length of the vessel to be occluded by a small focus diameter irradiation beam, are less efficient in bringing blood velocity down than a procedure which narrows the vessel over a greater length by a larger focus diameter irradiation beam. The thrombus building up over a greater length of the affected part of the vessel may also better resist the pressure head building up after thrombogenesis is complete because friction between thrombus and vessel wall is larger, and occlusion may, therefore, be more durable. One has to assess, therefore, whether a small-spot technique, which is presumed to be less efficient and may need repetitions, is in fact less innocuous for the surrounding retina--as is generally assumed--than a technique using a larger beam diameter, which, because it is more efficient, may need fewer or even no repetitions.\r"

  ".W": "The beneficial deep homogeneous coagulation of neodymium (Nd):YAG laser radiation at 1.06 microns owing to low absorption and high scattering in tissue has been documented widely. For another Nd:YAG laser wavelength at 1.32 microns the absorption coefficient of water and saline is approximately ten times higher than at 1.06 microns. This results in more efficient energy conversion into heat in tissue at 1.32 microns. The extinction coefficient in blood at 1.32 microns is only one-third of that at 1.06 microns. We would expect this to result in less heat dissipation by blood and deeper penetration in tissue at 1.32 microns. Nevertheless, at this wavelength scattering also contributes to an effective, uniform distribution of the laser light in the tissue. Animal experiments have been done to examine the effect of wavelength, irradiation time, and beam geometry on tissue damage and to assess its possible clinical uses. The results imply that the 1.32 microns wavelength will produce further indications for the use of the Nd:YAG laser in surgery.\r"

Dental office practice today is concerned mostly with uncontrolled studies of biostimulation and requires more basic research and controlled clinical studies.

We have histologically examined the natural history of channels produced with this technique and compared them with transmyocardial channels created by needle puncture. Immediately after application of the laser, four concentric zones vaporization, carbonization, fixation, and transition could be distinguished along the transmyocardial path. Needle puncture channels were fully occluded within 48 hr, whereas laser-induced channels maintained partial patency for a 2-week period, after which they also became occluded. It appears likely that the instantaneous vaporization produced by the laser may delay the release of factors which mediate the healing process, but occlusion of channels was universal in this study. It remains to be determined whether or not variables such as wattage, beam diameter, or tissue temperature influence long-term channel patency.\r"

PDT was administered using either Photofrin I or II as the photosensitizer and an argon-pumped tunable dye laser (630 nm) as the light source. Greater than additive increases in long-term tumor control were achieved when hyperthermia was given immediately post-PDT in the SMT-F and RIF tumor systems. Only additive (or independent) increases in tumor control were achieved when hyperthermia was given immediately before PDT in all these tumor systems and when heat was applied post-PDT using the EMT-6 tumor. In a series of experiments using the SMT-F tumor, it was observed that decreases in PDT drug or light doses could be offset (in terms of tumor control) by the addition of a subsequent heat treatment. This result, along with others presented, indicates the clinical potential of PDT and hyperthermia as adjuvant cancer modalities.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) is being currently used in patients with coronary artery disease. Laser irradiation (LI) has been effective in vaporizing atherosclerotic plaques. The purpose of this work was twofold: to compare PTA and LI techniques in the recanalization of experimental obstructive arterial lesions, and to evaluate the possibility of reducing the failures and local complications and increasing the success rate of PTA by the combined use of LI. Atherosclerotic iliac stenoses were induced in 27 rabbits; lesions were evaluated angiographically before and after intervention and were studied histologically and by electron microscopy. Argon-ion LI delivered through microlens-tip optic fibers reduced the stenotic area from 64.2 +/- 21.8% to 40.3 +/- 10.7% (n = 10, P less than .01) and PTA from 60.7 +/- 15.9% to 30.4 +/- 7.7% (n = 9, P less than .01). However, percentage reduction was higher in PTA-treated stenoses (48.4 +/- 10.1% vs 34.5 +/- 13.5%, P less than .0125). In eight more rabbits, low power LI (4.55 +/- 1.25 J) was delivered after PTA in dilated segments. Post-PTA LI further decreased stenoses (from 31.2 +/- 7.8% to 29.1 +/- 8.1%, P less than .0125); laser-irradiated segments showed diffuse carbonization of the disrupted intimal layer. The normalized transtenotic pressure gradient decreased significantly in all groups: LI reduced the gradient from .40 +/- .25 to .17 +/- .07 (P = .005); PTA from .37 +/- .14 to .11 +/- .04 (P = .001); LI after PTA from .40 +/- .16 to .12 +/- .06 (P = .001). Thus, LI is effective (less than PTA) in relieving experimental atherosclerotic stenoses and seems useful when combined with PTA.\r"

Endoscopic laser treatment was found to be most effective when the tumor was polypoid in appearance bronchoscopically, with little or no submucosal invasion or peribronchial extension seen on CT. When bronchoscopy and CT showed increasing submucosal and/or peribronchial disease, the immediate and long-term response to treatment was poorer. CT provided valuable information regarding the extent of the peribronchial involvement and airway distortion which were often underestimated by bronchoscopy alone. Reduction of regional perfusion out of proportion to ventilation on scintigraphy in the involved lung zone was found to be associated with extensive peribronchial involvement. We conclude that the addition of CT and radionuclide quantitative ventilation-perfusion lung scan to bronchoscopic examination is useful in predicting the response of patients with obstructive endobronchial tumors to laser treatment. Whether PDT or YAG laser is more effective in relieving endobronchial obstruction by tumor awaits a randomized controlled trial.\r"

After 7 years of positive clinical control in human beings, we decided to start an experimental study of fractures in the tibia of mice, histologically controlling its reparation after exposure to 632 nm. He/Ne laser in doses of 2.4 Joules in one point was used. The radiation was directly applied to the area of fracture in a series of 12 treatments (one treatment every second day). By optic microscope we observed, in the treated animals, an important increase in vascularization and faster formation of osseous tissue with a dense trabecular net compared to the control group, which presented only chondroid tissue and poor vascularization corresponding to an earlier stage of bone consolidation (controls were also analyzed by electron microscopy). Potentially, the laser effect might modulate the function of osteocytes, promoting faster metabolism and reaction of bone callus.\r"

Sixteen patients were given oral contraceptives, 12 for birth control and four for pain. Four patients received danazol plus oral contraceptives as concurrent therapy. Overall, symptoms improved following surgery for 45 patients (74%); two patients (3%) reported a worsening of symptoms, while 12 patients (20%) reported no change in their symptoms. The overall improvement rate was 65% for those receiving no hormonal treatment, 70% for those on danazol, 94% for those on oral contraceptives, and 75% for those on both contraceptives and danazol. This latter finding, however, is not significant because of the small patient sampling. Nevertheless, these findings reflect the benefit of laser ablation of early-stage pelvic endometriosis with or without the concurrent use of conservative medical therapy.\r"

Later, the tumor was exposed to a wavelength of 630 nm from a dye laser. We noted complete remission, as documented by biopsies, in all tumors, with clinical thickness less than 2 mm, whereas partial remission was obtained in tumors with clinical thickness more than 2 mm. Our experience suggests the possibility of a routine treatment by this method for flat basal cell carcinoma and pre-malignant lesions, with remarkable advantages to conventional therapies. Our results have to be confirmed by increasing the number of cases and length of follow up; our short follow up does not allow us to make definitive claims regarding this therapy.\r"
