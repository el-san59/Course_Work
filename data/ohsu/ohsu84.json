There was also a nonstatistically significant increase in risk among younger women smoking more than two packs of cigarettes a day (odds ratio = 2.0), but overall there was no evidence of any relationship. Similarly, no association between ovarian cancer and cigarette smoking was apparent, although there was a nonsignificant increase in risk among women under age 50 years who smoked 40 or more cigarettes a day or were exsmokers.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve normal parturients were studied with a continuous wave Doppler unit to assess changes in uterine and umbilical velocity waveforms during labor. The analysis of these waveforms included the peak systolic/end-diastolic ratio and the evaluation of a diastolic notch. Each woman served as her own control, and all fetal heart rate tracings were normal. In latent phase labor and intact membranes, the umbilical artery systolic/end diastolic ratios before, during, and after a contraction were 2 +/- 0.2, 2 +/- 0.3 and 1.95 +/- 0.3 (N.S.). Similar results were obtained in the active phase, after rupture of membranes, or during oxytocin stimulation. This stability of the fetal cardiovascular system ensures an uninterrupted gas exchange process during the contractions (on the fetal side), enabling the great majority of term fetuses to tolerate labor with minimal if any metabolic changes. The uterine artery end-diastolic velocity fell progressively during the contraction, reaching 0 when the intrauterine pressure exceeded 35 mm Hg. Despite intrauterine pressure of greater than 60 mm Hg, the diastolic notch did not appear. Thus at term, the umbilical artery velocity waveform does not change over a wide range of uterine pressures. The changes seen in the uterine artery waveforms suggest that the end-diastolic component is primarily determined by changes in the arcuate and spiral arteries, both of which are affected during the uterine contraction.\r"

Self-reported pelvic inflammatory disease was higher among women who had ever used an intrauterine device (23%) than among those who had ever used oral contraceptives (17%). Controlling for other variables, fertility problems were most common among women who had never used a method (42%), but they were also more common among oral contraceptive users (26%) than intrauterine devices users (17%). Our findings are consistent with the hypotheses that intrauterine devices were used primarily by women with proved fertility and oral contraceptives were associated with pelvic inflammatory disease in complex ways, although the exact nature of this association and the underlying disease are not yet completely understood.\r"

C. trachomatis was isolated from 34 (18%) subjects. The incidence of C. trachomatis differed by race: it was isolated from 30% of black subjects and 7% of nonblack subjects. Polymorphonuclear cells on Gram stains were found to be associated with the presence of C. trachomatis (chi 2 = 33.2, p less than 0.0001). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for polymorphonuclear cells to predict the presence of C. trachomatis were 91% (31/34), 65% (103/159), and 36% (31/87), respectively. When examined by ethnicity, polymorphonuclear cells remained significantly associated with C. trachomatis for black subjects (chi 2 = 24.3, p less than 0.001) but not for nonblack subjects (chi 2 = 2.49, p less than 0.1). Mucopurulent discharge, friability, or erythema-edema of ectopy were not reliable indicators for C. trachomatis. Endocervical Gram stains alone are useful to identify populations at risk for C. trachomatis infection.

Review of the endometrial curettings revealed that the most common endometrium associated with ectopic pregnancy was secretory (39.4%). Proliferative endometrium present 19% of the time was as common a finding as Arias-Stella phenomenon. This study shows that any type of endometrium lacking trophoblasts may be associated with an ectopic pregnancy. The lack of decidual reaction or Arias-Stella phenomenon should not alone lower the clinician's index of suspicion.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we examined whether the doubling time of human chorionic gonadotropin is different at different stages of early pregnancy and whether the use of multiple nomograms for doubling time of human chorionic gonadotropin rather than a single critical value can improve the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Forty-four women with intrauterine pregnancies who had abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding but who did not abort their pregnancies and 44 women with surgically proved ectopic pregnancies were studied. No difference was found in the doubling time of human chorionic gonadotropin when women were classified according to recently published criteria (Pittaway DE, Reish RL, Wentz AC. Doubling times of human chorionic gonadotropin increase in early viable intrauterine pregnancies. Am J Obstet gynecol 1985;152:299-302), and estimates of the doubling time of human chorionic gonadotropin were not influenced by the initial human chorionic gonadotropin values or the sampling interval used. In the human chorionic gonadotropin range of practical interest, multiple nomograms identified 26 of 33 (79%) women with ectopic pregnancy who had rising levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, whereas our previously reported criteria identified 28 of 37 (76%) cases. The false positive rate for each method was 9.7%. Seventeen (19%) of 88 patients could not be allotted to the human chorionic gonadotropin categories for which nomograms of the doubling time of human chorionic gonadotropin have been derived. We conclude that our previous recommendations for determining the rate of increase of human chorionic gonadotropin in serum from paired samples do not require revision at this time.\r"

The low birth weight rate (less than 2500 gm) was significantly increased during residency (p less than 0.002), and infants born during residency were 7.5 times more likely to be growth retarded than those born outside residency (p less than 0.002). The incidence of other pregnancy complications was not found to be increased during residency.

Cholesteryl palmitate concentration increased with gestational age from values less than 5 micrograms/ml at 15 weeks to maximum values of 384 micrograms/ml at term. Seventy-three patients were delivered of their infants within 24 hours of sampling. The mean concentration of cholesteryl palmitate for 55 infants without respiratory distress syndrome was 123.70 +/- 12.21 micrograms/ml (SD). For neonates that developed respiratory distress syndrome (n = 18), the mean concentration was 22.66 +/- 6.16 micrograms/ml (SD). This difference is significant (p less than 0.001). For all patients delivered, respiratory distress syndrome was not seen when the cholesteryl palmitate concentration was greater than 41 micrograms/ml (mean + 3 SD). All infants with a concentration below 38 micrograms/ml developed respiratory distress syndrome. We conclude that measurement of cholesteryl palmitate concentration in amniotic fluid might be another reliable method of assessing fetal lung maturity and may often improve specificity when compared with other tests of fetal lung maturity.\r"

Concentrations of pyruvate and lactate, but not of glycogen and glucose, were significantly low in placentas of mothers with severe preeclampsia, supporting previous indirect evidence of inhibited glycolysis. Nevertheless, direct measurements of adenine nucleotide concentrations did not indicate reduced placental energy level in the preeclamptic placentas. This along with a lack of change of the ratio of lactate/pyruvate concentration (an indication of the redox state of cytoplasmic reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is also evidence against the hypothesis of general placental ischemia leading to energy deficiency. However, as glycolysis is an important source of precursors, particularly pyruvate, for synthesis of amino acids and lipids, these results suggest that there is a significant metabolic abnormality in placentas of mothers with severe preeclampsia.\r"

Fluorescein angiography demonstrated an intact peripapillary choriocapillaris, loss of peripapillary retina and retinal pigment epithelium, and complete disruption of retinal perfusion. We have postulated a mechanism for traumatic peripapillary retinal evulsion involving severe anterior displacement and abduction of the globe that may explain how the disruptive force was transmitted to the nasal retinal nerve fiber layer. We have provided a clinical correlation with magnetic resonance imaging of the optic nerve and globe of a normal individual.\r"

As visual acuity decreased, the contrast sensitivity function decreased along the contrast sensitivity axis, and peak sensitivity shifted to lower spatial frequencies. After patching therapy, when visual acuity reached 20/20 in each eye, suggesting that the amblyopia was cured, there continued to be statistically significant difference in the contrast sensitivity functions between the eyes. The contrast sensitivity function from the previously amblyopic eye was depressed compared to the nonamblyopic eye. A comparison between patients with strabismic and anisometropic amblyopia showed that, when matched for visual acuity, the contrast sensitivity functions were similar for both the nonamblyopic and amblyopic eyes. However, a large difference was found between the amblyopic and nonamblyopic eyes of each group.\r"

After this initial treatment, these dogs were separated into three groups. Two groups received six courses of mitoxantrone (0.25 mg/kg, 5 mg/sq m) commencing at 7 weeks or 19 weeks after the final doxorubicin treatment. The third group was treated with six additional courses of doxorubicin after an interval of 7 weeks. Up to seven sequential endomyocardial biopsies were performed to monitor the myocardial changes which were observed after the initial doxorubicin treatment. The low-grade cardiotoxic changes progressed for at least 7-11 weeks without any additional doxorubicin treatment, and stabilized or even partially reversed after 19 weeks of a treatment-free period. Dogs that received additional doxorubicin demonstrated progressive cardiotoxicity, associated with clinical signs, that resulted in death after a total of seven to ten courses of treatment (12-16 mg/kg, 238-340 mg/sq m cumulative dose). In dogs treated with doxorubicin followed by mitoxantrone after a 19-week treatment-free period, myocardial changes were shown to have stabilized and/or partially regressed. This study indicated that in beagle dogs four courses of doxorubicin (7 mg/kg, 136 mg/sq m cumulative dose) are the threshold dose at which non-life-threatening cardiotoxicity occurs. Residual toxic effects of doxorubicin may be erroneously interpreted as adverse findings attributable to other agents given subsequently during the susceptible period, ie, prior to stabilization of the myocardium. Mitoxantrone given after stabilization of doxorubicin-induced low-grade myocardial changes did not show additive or synergistic effects.\r"

Both treatments resulted in inhibition of growth of suckling mice and severe fatty changes and necrosis in the liver. The simultaneous injection of polyclonal antibody to interferon alpha/beta abrogated the effects of interferon but did not block the effects induced by TNF. The kidneys of TNF-treated suckling mice could be distinguished from interferon-treated mice by the absence of glomerular basement membrane abnormalities and the presence of numerous rounded eosinophilic hyaline granules within the cytoplasm of the proximal tubules. Treatment of suckling mice with TNF and interferon alpha/beta induced similar changes in the spleen and thymus. Interferon treatment of suckling A2G mice resulted in the appearance of pulmonary cysts, which were not observed in TNF-treated mice. It is concluded that the pattern of lesions induced in suckling mice by mouse TNF is both similar and different from that induced by mouse interferon alpha/beta.\r"

Ethanol caused degranulation and/or disruption of gastric mucosal mast cells, and, at certain concentrations of ethanol, mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv or WCB6F1-Sl/Sld mice developed significantly less (43-90% less) acute gastric injury than either congenic +/+ mice or WBB6F1-W/Wv mice whose mast cells were restored by bone marrow transplantation from WBB6F1-+/+ mice. Nevertheless, ethanol produced detectable, and in some cases substantial, gastric injury even in the complete absence of mast cells. Thus, ethanol can produce some damage to the gastric mucosa independently of mast cells. But these data suggest that under certain circumstances mast cells can augment the area of acute gastric injury induced by ethanol.\r"

Quantitative changes were evident in the nasal transitional and respiratory epithelium. At 6 or 90 days of exposure to 0.15 or 0.30 ppm O3 lesions consisted of ciliated cell necrosis, shortened cilia, and secretory cell hyperplasia. Inflammatory cell influx was only present at 6 days of exposure. Ultrastructural changes in goblet cells were evident at 90 days. Ambient levels of O3 can induce significant nasal epithelial lesions, which may compromise upper respiratory defense mechanisms.\r"

This study examines the structural features of the pulmonary artery bed, another contributing factor to hypoxic hypertension. After 14 days of hypobaric hypoxia, in Hilltop rats, more of the intraacinar arteries became muscular, and the medial thickness of intraacinar and preacinar arteries was greater. In Hilltop control rats, muscle was found in more intraacinar arteries, but, paradoxically, acute hypoxic vasoconstriction was less. Thus, while in chronic hypoxia increased muscle correlates with pulmonary hypertension, in control rats the reserve seems to be true. The increased muscle in control Hilltop rats could, however, predispose to the greater muscularization seen after chronic hypoxia.\r"

The authors have examined the ability of cationic (histone, polyhistidine, polyarginine) and anionic (polyanetholsulfonate) polyelectrolytes to modulate acute immune complex-mediated tissue injury. Tissue injury elicited in rats by the reversed dermal Arthus reaction was increased 26-43% by addition of polyelectrolytes to antibody prior to its intradermal injection. Kinetic studies using 111In-labeled neutrophils indicated that the enhanced tissue injury was not the result of increased influx of neutrophils. Infusion of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase prior to induction of the Arthus reaction resulted in 40-68% suppression of tissue injury. Concomitant in vitro functional studies (enzyme secretion, O-2 and H2O2 generation, and chemiluminescence) of rat neutrophils demonstrated that addition of polyelectrolytes to preformed immune complexes (IgG-bovine serum albumin) resulted in marked increases in O-2, H2O2, and chemiluminescence, but no increases in enzyme secretion, compared with neutrophils stimulated with immune complexes alone. The cationic polyelectrolytes did not alter the capacity of preformed immune complexes to activate complement in vitro. These studies suggest that both cationic and anionic polyelectrolytes can increase the pathogenic potential of immune complexes and that this modulation is, at least in part, mediated by enhanced generation of toxic oxygen-derived metabolites by neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to assess the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the middle part of the deltoid and of the supraspinatus muscles in subjects suffering from supraspinatus tendinitis. This experimental group (N = 10) was compared to a control group (N = 10). Each subject performed three isometric contractions for each of four pre- determined levels (5, 20, 35 and 50%) of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) during shoulder abduction. These contractions were carried out at angles of 0 degree and 45 degrees of abduction. The EMG signals obtained for each subject were integrated and normalized in a Z score form. Trend analysis, performed on the data of each of the two groups, revealed the existence of a significant (p less than 0.001) linear relationship between the integrated EMG (IEMG) and torque levels for each muscle investigated, at both angles of abduction. Furthermore, in the control group, similar EMG amplitudes were obtained for each muscle at these two angles of abduction. However, in the experimental group, the IEMG of the deltoid muscle showed a significant decrease in activity relative to the activity of the supraspinatus at an angle of 45 degrees of abduction (ANOVA, p less than 0.05). It is suggested that this inhibition of the deltoid reflects a compensatory mechanism. The purpose of this mechanism could be to prevent the compression of the affected supraspinatus tendon between the humeral head and the acromion that could occur while abducting the arm.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of wearing graduated compression stockings (GCS) on the exercise response, twelve high fit males served as subjects in a series of two experiments. The first experiment consisted of six subjects performing two tests of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) on a treadmill with and without GCS. The second experiment consisted of six subjects performing three separate three minute tests on a bicycle ergometer at 110% of their VO2 max. The experimental conditions for the three tests were: GCS worn during the test and recovery (GCS), GCS worn only during the test (GCS-O/O) and no stockings worn during either the test or recovery (NO-GCS). Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured at rest, throughout the duration of all tests and during recovery in both experiments. Blood samples were obtained at rest and at 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes post exercise in the first experiment and at rest and at 5, 15 and 30 minutes post exercise in the second experiment for the determination of lactate and hematocrit. The use of GCS in the first experiment resulted in no significant difference in VO2 max, recovery VO2 or plasma volume shifts. Lactate values were lower throughout the duration of the recovery period with the 15 minute values being significantly different with the use of GCS. Significant differences in post exercise blood lactate values were found in the second experiment. The GCS trial resulted in significantly less lactate when compared to the GCS-O/O and the NO-GCS trials. There was no significant difference in post exercise lactate values between the NO-GCS and the GCS-O/O trials. Plasma volume changes were not significantly different among trials. Results of both experiments showed recovery lactate values to be lower with the use of GCS. These lower values are not ascribable to plasma volume shifts but rather appear to be due to an inverse gradient created by the GCS resulting in the lactate being retained in the muscular bed.\r"

The model proposed here attempts to fill this void by developing a conceptual understanding of the nature of moral dilemmas that can be applied to both theoretical and practical problems in medicine. Practical applications are demonstrated in three areas: personal ethical problem solving, hospital ethics committees, and the teaching of medical ethics. Suggestions are offered for the extension of these and other applications of the model, a model proposed as a foundation to be built upon through further research and daily experiences in a world of conflicting values.\r"

They also found that depressed patients with high HPA activity tend to have lower CSF levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, a serotonin metabolite, and modestly lower levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, a metabolite of epinephrine and norepinephrine, than patients with normal HPA activity. These findings provide potentially important leads for understanding interactions of biogenic amine systems with HPA axis function.\r"

There was little evidence for either selective placement on the basis of parental fatness or gene-environment interaction. There was no relationship between the degree of fatness of adoptive parents and that of the adoptees. Two indexes of environmental influence--rural upbringing and disturbance in the adoptive home--predicted fatness among adoptees.\r"

These relationships remained significant when the effects of physical fitness and body build were partialled out, suggesting that psychological components of physiologic phenomena accounted for their prediction of mental health outcome. The authors speculate that a high resting heart rate reflected social anxiety and prolonged running time reflected perseverance and stoicism.\r"

Also, the frequency of panic disorder was higher among relatives of probands with panic disorder than among control relatives but was not higher among relatives of generalized anxiety probands. Relatives of probands with generalized anxiety who had the same disorder had a mild, stress-related illness.

The 28 patients who had not responded to antidepressants recovered after treatment with ECT. Treatment modality had a highly significant effect on length of hospital stay: patients given ECT stayed a mean of 13 fewer days, saving more than $6,400 per patient at current rates. These findings of significant economic and therapeutic benefits in the use of ECT raise issues about treatment selection for depressed inpatients.\r"

Yohimbine produced panic attacks meeting DSM-III criteria in 37 patients and one healthy subject. The patients reporting yohimbine-induced panic attacks had significantly larger increases in plasma MHPG, cortisol, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate than the healthy subjects. These findings support the hypothesis relating high noradrenergic neuronal activity to the pathophysiology of panic attacks in a subgroup of panic disorder patients.\r"

Given the present rate of producing psychiatrists, shifts in demands for psychiatric services, changing payment and access patterns regarding specialty medical care, increasing numbers of nonpsychiatrist mental health professionals, and a probable surfeit of primary care physicians, underemployment of psychiatrists may become commonplace. Future psychiatrists will likely be used more as consultants, and the profession will need fewer, but better trained, graduates. The authors present alternative proposals to deal with service needs related to such reductions.\r"

Six cases demonstrating meperidine-induced behavioral toxicity are reported. Toxicity was more likely when meperidine was combined with cimetidine or drugs having anticholinergic activity. Discontinuation of meperidine and substitution of morphine for analgesia were usually successful in treating the delirium. Physostigmine reversed the delirium in one patient. The authors suggest that the delirium results from the excessive anticholinergic activity of meperidine or its only active metabolite, normeperidine.\r"

Applying these data and the analogy of the known functional and structural defects in the peripheral (cranial) sensory system consequent to high-intensity stimulation, he hypothesizes that cortical neuronal and synaptic changes occur in posttraumatic stress disorder as the consequence of excessive and prolonged sensitizing stimulation leading to depression of habituating learning. He postulates that the \"constant\" symptoms of the disorder are due to the changes in the agonistic neuronal system which impair cortical control of hindbrain structures concerned with aggressive expression and the sleep-dream cycle.\r"

Neonatal mortality was elevated for both planned (17 observed deaths vs 8.59 expected deaths) and unplanned home births (45 observed vs 33.19 expected) compared with physician-attended hospital births. Nearly all of the mortality excess for planned home births occurred in association with lesser trained attendants (12 observed vs 4.42 expected), while for unplanned home births the excess was entirely among infants weighing 1500 grams or more (19 observed vs 3.50 expected). For planned home births attended by physicians, certified nurse-midwives, or Missouri Midwife Association recognized midwives, there was little difference between observed and expected deaths (5 observed vs 3.92 expected). There also was little difference in deaths for unplanned home births weighing less than 1500 grams (26 observed vs 29.69 expected) compared with hospital births. The study provides evidence of the importance of having skilled attendants present at planned home births.\r"

Research assistants posing as regular patrons (\"pseudopatrons\") visited two bars where about half of the servers had received server intervention training. Pseudopatrons set the occasion for server intervention to occur by drinking six alcoholic beverages in two hours. The blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) of the pseudopatrons was measured after they left the bar. Results revealed that trained servers initiated more server interventions than did untrained personnel. Moreover, pseudopatrons served by trained personnel reached substantially lower BACs than those served by untrained servers. These results suggest that, if implemented on a large scale, server intervention programs have the potential of reducing drunken driving by helping to decrease the exit BACs of bar patrons.\r"

This increase has been observed for all ages, and within all regions of the country. The rate for teenagers and mothers aged 20 to 29 was five to six times as high in 1985 as in 1965, and four times as high for mothers aged 30 years and older. Repeat cesareans account for an increasing share of all cesarean deliveries; in 1985 one in three cesareans were repeats. The increase in the cesarean rate of 6.2 percentage points between 1980 and 1985 (from 16.5 to 22.7) was partitioned according to five complications of delivery recorded on hospital discharge records: previous cesarean delivery, breech presentation, dystocia, fetal distress, and all other complications. Nearly half (48 per cent) of the increase was associated with previous cesarean delivery, 29 per cent with dystocia, 16 per cent with fetal distress, 5 per cent with breech presentation, and 2 per cent with all other complications.\r"

Indochinese refugees and male homosexuals with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and pre-AIDS had higher mean antibody levels than did healthy controls, whereas sewer and highway maintenance workers had levels similar to those of controls. Serum antibodies to Entamoeba histolytica measured by an indirect hemagglutination antibody technique were detected in only a few Indochinese refugees. We conclude that serology is a promising tool in G. lamblia epidemiology and that further population studies would be of interest.\r"

Dental caries in the Mexican American children was predominantly a disease of occlusal surfaces of molars; few smooth surfaces of posterior and anterior teeth were affected by caries. This intra-oral distribution of dental caries strongly supports the use of fissure sealants as a preventive procedure. Filled tooth surfaces contributed about 66 per cent of the total DMFS (decayed, missing, filled surfaces) scores. The analysis also shows that about 50 per cent of the 17 year old Mexican Americans had five or more filled or decayed teeth. Mild gingivitis was prevalent (76.9 per cent) in the Mexican American children.\r"

The analysis was limited to smokers and never-smokers aged 25-60 whose 1959 questionnaires included at least the minimal variables for prediction using the CDC/HRA (age, sex, race, height, weight, and smoking habits). For men and women overall and in each age group, the observed proportion dying over 20 years of follow-up increased as the difference between 1959 age and risk age increased. CDC/HRA predicted 10-year risks of mortality appeared to improve upon age-sex-race predicted risks of mortality when compared to the observed proportion dying over 10 years and when predictors were used in a logistic regression model with vital status after 10 years as the dependent variable. Thus, CDC/HRA may be an appropriate method for identifying high-risk populations for health interventions.\r"

This article examines the contraceptive and fertility behavior after their last clinic visits. The results showed that most of these women were \"protected\" from pregnancy risk considerably beyond their last clinic visit. However, the analysis also revealed that in spite of the reported high contraceptive use rate, unplanned pregnancies occurred after the client's last clinic visit, suggesting that contraceptive use was either inconsistent or ineffective. These findings suggest that instead of allocating a large proportion of resources to follow-up acceptors to bring the \"drop-outs\" back to the clinics, a more effective program strategy would be to systematically and effectively educate and counsel the clients during their clinic attendance, especially during their first clinic visit.\r"

Alcohol abuse contributed to 12 per cent (33,909) of all years of potential life lost, two-thirds of which were secondary to injury. The estimated cost of alcohol abuse ranged from $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion, representing from 2.8 per cent to 4.3 per cent of all personal income of Minnesotans, from 32 per cent to 50 per cent of State expenditures, and from 26 to 39 times the alcohol excise tax revenues generated in 1983. Alcohol-related direct medical care costs were estimated to be at least $216 million, 3.8 per cent of Minnesota medical costs for 1983. Costs of reduced on-the-job productivity and short-term absenteeism related to alcohol abuse were estimated to be between $630 million and $1.2 billion. The documentation of the costs of alcohol abuse is an important step in the campaign to reduce alcohol-related deaths, morbidity, and health care costs.\r"

Without being able to adjust for the severity of the patient's underlying condition or the appropriateness and outcome of the surgery, the average per procedure charge submitted by an orthopedist was 17 per cent higher than that of a DPM; orthopedists were five times as likely to perform a procedure on an inpatient basis, and admitted patients to a hospital had longer stays; DPMs perform a greater number of procedures per episode, but their overall charges during the average foot surgery episode were 30 per cent lower, primarily because of their lower hospitalization rates. The possible impact of recent changes in health care delivery on the DPM/orthopedist practice comparison are discussed as are several questions regarding the quality and need of the care provided by these two groups.\r"

As taurine is abundantly present in leukocytes, eosinophils have the potential to generate taurine chloramine or taurine bromamine.

About 120 million persons are estimated to be at risk of the infection in Africa, and 20 million more in India and Pakistan. Both major endemic countries in Asia have begun efforts to eliminate the disease, and by the end of 1986, national anti-dracunculiasis programs were underway or planned in 8 of the 19 affected African countries. In May 1986, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on the elimination of dracunculiasis-the first such resolution since the successful Smallpox Eradication Program. India, which began its Guinea Worm Eradication Program in 1980, has already eliminated the disease from one of seven endemic states, and reduced the total number of cases found through active surveillance by 35% between 1983 and 1985. In Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), the only African country to conduct active surveillance for dracunculiasis so far, an aggressive combined program of rural water supply, health education, and active surveillance has reduced the disease from 4,971 cases in 1976 to 592 cases in 1985.\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on four subjects prior to infection and at times when larval migration through the pulmonary tree was likely. Eggs were demonstrated in the stools of four volunteers who remained untreated for more than 6 weeks; one volunteer had to be treated at day 40 because of severe gastrointestinal symptoms. All others also complained of abdominal pain and flatulence between days 35-40. All volunteers developed marked blood eosinophilia which peaked between days 38-64 and ranged from 1,350-3,828 eosinophils/mm3. Small increases in total and parasite-specific IgE and IgG were noted in some volunteers. One volunteer showed a significant lymphocyte blastogenic response. With the exception of mucosal erythema, bronchoalveolar lavage results were unremarkable. Our data indicate that a single small inoculum of hookworm larvae is capable of producing significant transient gastrointestinal morbidity and marked blood eosinophilia but does not induce other prominent T cell- and B cell-dependent immune responses.\r"

The changing immune responses to parasite antigens prepared from three sources--Brugia pahangi adult worm homogenate extract, adult worm excretory-secretory products, and microfilaria excretory-secretory products--were monitored by Western blot ELISA of antigens fractionated on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and by microtiter plate ELISA. Assays were used to detect antibodies in both the the IgG and IgE classes. A wide range of clinical manifestations was demonstrated in response to reinfection: asymptomatic, amicrofilaremic; asymptomatic, microfilaremic; acute short duration node enlargement and/or limb edema with microfilaremia; and chronic limb edema, amicrofilaremic. On microtiter plate ELISA, the dogs demonstrating the highest anti-adult worm homogenate titers were amicrofilaremic and were asymptomatic or developed chronic limb edema, dogs with high anti-mf ES titers were persistently amicrofilaremic, and the most marked increases against all three antigen sources upon reinfection occurred in low or amicrofilaremic dogs. Quantitative changes in antibody levels against the three crude antigen sources following reinfection were often paralleled by distinct changes in recognition of specific bands of antigens fractionated by SDS-PAGE.\r"

The ultrastructural appearances of the latter were not significantly different from those seen in vitro although the cell wall was less well defined and did not stain with Alcian blue, and there were more intracellular lipid droplets. Host cells surrounding the mass were incorporated into the structure of the grain, a process associated with cell death.

Trapping studies were conducted at four geographically separate and ecologically distinct regions in Wisconsin to elucidate the distribution and host preferences of Ixodes dammini on small and medium sized mammals, and the occurrence of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in these wild mammals. Peak I. dammini larval activity occurred from June-September. Nymphs were most active from May-August. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and chipmunks (Tamias striatus) were important hosts for immature ticks. Mean numbers of I. dammini per mouse were highest in regions of high prevalence of Lyme disease. Antibody to B. burgdorferi was detected in sera of 60/371 (16%) white-footed mice, 5/104 (5%) chipmunks, 3/5 (60%) gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), 0/8 raccoons (procyon lotor), and 0/12 opossum (Didelphis virginiana); antibody prevalence correlated positively with I. dammini occurrence, and seropositive animals were not detected in areas where I. dammini were not found. Two of 15 recaptured P. leucopus had greater than or equal to 4-fold changes in antibody titer. B. burgdorferi was cultured from blood of a P. leucopus captured in west-central Wisconsin, and was observed by direct immunofluorescence in 9/23 (39%) I. dammini nymphs. In Wisconsin, I. dammini has increased in numbers and has significantly expanded its range since its first recognition in 1968.\r"

  ".W": "A 0.59 kilobase DNA fragment cloned from an rDNA cistron of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae can be used as a probe to differentiate between A. gambiae, A. arabiensis, and A. melas, three morphologically identical sibling species in the A. gambiae complex which otherwise can be reliably distinguished only by polytene chromosome banding patterns. Although all are important (and often sympatric) African malaria vectors, their relative roles in malaria transmission have thus far been difficult to assess. The probe, an EcoRI-SalI fragment from the 3' end of the 28S beta coding region of the cistron, is present in all three species, but the species differ uniquely with respect to the location of an EcoRI site in the nontranscribed spacer (NTS) downstream of the fragment. We have routinely used the probe to identify A. gambiae complex mosquitoes to species on the basis of genomic DNA extracted from individual air dried specimens. A single mosquito abdomen provides more than sufficient DNA for the assay, and neither eggs nor a bloodmeal in the abdomen interfere with DNA yield. Moreover, the DNA extraction procedure does not degrade the bloodmeal IgG, so the residual protein pellet can be used to identify the mosquito bloodmeal source. Since the rDNA cistron organization as detected by the probe does not differ between male and female mosquitoes, the probe can be used for either sex. Preliminary experiments show that the probe is equally useful for mosquito larvae and pupae.\r"

The scheme proved to be easy to learn and to use. Its utility was demonstrated by the previously unreported distinctions that became apparent when various patient subsets were analyzed according to the CHAT classification. These included an improved probability of stroke-free survival in patients operated on for brief strokes (transient ischemic attack) as opposed to temporary strokes (reversible ischemic neurologic deficit), and similarly improved survival probability in patients operated on for amaurosis fugax in comparison to those with carotid territory hemispheric transient ischemic attacks. The impact of multiple arterial lesions and positive computerized tomography scan findings appeared to be minimal with respect to both late stroke and survival in our preliminary observations. The simplicity and utility of the CHAT scheme make it a useful method to evaluate and report clinical experience with cerebrovascular disease.\r"

Delayed gastric emptying was present in more than 50 percent as evidenced by more than 50 percent retention of technetium-99m sulfur colloid in semisolid feedings at 90 minutes. Esophageal motility disorders occurred in over 35 percent of the patients with symptomatic reflux, militating against performing a tight antireflux operation. Of 352 patients who had operation for symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux, 308 underwent gastroesophageal fundoplication alone, 26 underwent gastroesophageal fundoplication and pyloroplasty, 12 had pyloroplasty alone, and 6 had gastroesophageal fundoplication followed by pyloroplasty as a second operation because of residual delay in gastric emptying. An abnormal result of esophageal pH monitoring and decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure with normal gastric emptying suggest use of the gastroesophageal fundoplication alone. Delay in gastric emptying combined with decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure and abnormal results of esophageal pH monitoring indicate the use of gastroesophageal fundoplication plus pyloroplasty. A mildly abnormal esophageal pH value in combination with a high-normal lower esophageal sphincter pressure and marked delay in gastric emptying (over 60 percent retention at 90 minutes) suggest the use of pyloroplasty alone. The excellent clinical results achieved with gastroesophageal fundoplication, with or without pyloroplasty, and the low morbidity and mortality rates indicate that these procedures should be used early in the management of infants and children with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested a direct relationship between the serum bilirubin level and the risk of operation. However, patients with high bilirubin levels are usually older and have associated conditions unrelated to jaundice that may contribute to the development of postoperative complications. We studied the courses of 98 consecutive patients who were admitted with biliary obstruction and a serum bilirubin level of 10 mg/dl or greater and underwent operation. Sixty-one had neoplastic obstructions, 26 had benign biliary strictures, 8 had choledocholithiasis, and 3 had other obstructive lesions. Comorbid factors were evaluated and assigned a score to reflect their severity. Neither age nor advanced local cancer was considered to be a comorbid factor. Biliary obstruction was treated by resection of the bile duct, the pancreas, or both in 28 patients, by bilioenteric bypass in 55 patients, and by other operations in 15 patients. Postoperatively, complications developed in 30 patients and 8 died. There was no correlation between the admission serum bilirubin level, hematocrit value, or serum albumin level and the development of complications or death. There was a strong correlation between the presence of severe associated disease and the risk of postoperative complications or death. Nineteen of 81 patients with a comorbid score below 4 had a complication compared with 11 of 17 patients with scores of 4 or higher (p less than 0.01). Two of the 81 patients with scores below 4 died compared with 6 of 17 patients with a score of 4 or higher. These findings show that postoperative deaths and serious complications in patients with severe jaundice are principally the result of uncontrolled associated disease and that jaundice per se does not contribute substantially to an undesirable outcome.\r"

The operation is directed against the cause of both pilonidal disease and the unhealed wound, which appears to be skin pulling away from bone, and not against the abscess in fat, which is a secondary effect.\r"

We identified 26 patients who met rigid criteria for the diagnosis of Buerger's disease. An analysis of the management and extended follow-up of these patients has indicated that Buerger's disease, although rare, is a real clinical entity which can be diagnosed objectively. The relatively high rate of limb loss (31 percent of patients) documents the virulence of Buerger's disease involving the lower extremities. No major upper extremity amputations were required, and no patient lost further tissue after cessation of smoking. These findings and the low mortality rate in this study stand in contrast to many previous reports and may aid in establishing the current natural history of Buerger's disease in North America.\r"

Analyzing these 9 patients and 56 other patients previously described in the literature, we found several clinically important relationships. In contrast to the usual midgut and hindgut origin, most carcinoids associated with MEN (69 percent) are of foregut origin (thymus 24 percent, bronchus 27 percent, stomach 3 percent, and duodenum 14 percent). Carcinoids are more commonly associated with MEN type 1 than MEN type 2 (59 patients and 6 patients, respectively). Thymic carcinoids associated with MEN are more common in men (15 versus 2), and most (82 percent) are malignant. Bronchial carcinoids associated with MEN are more common in women (15 versus 4), and most (74 percent) are benign. There is a strong association between thymic carcinoids and parathyroid tumors and between bronchial carcinoids and pituitary tumors. Most patients with carcinoids and hyperparathyroidism (82 percent) have had parathyroid hyperplasia or multiple parathyroid adenomas. Thus, carcinoids may occur in association with both MEN type I and MEN type II. MEN should be suspected in patients with foregut carcinoids. Patients with MEN and ectopic ACTH production should be considered to have bronchial carcinoids if they are female and thymic carcinoid if they are male. The thymus should be routinely removed in patients with MEN type I because of the possible presence of an ectopic parathyroid gland in this tissue and to prevent subsequent development of a carcinoid tumor.\r"

Seventeen of 18 patients operated on before the age of 10 weeks became free of jaundice within 2 to 4 months and had biliary intestinal continuity established by 10 months of age. Two of these patients experienced sudden diminution of bile flow with return of jaundice. Both responded to transconduit repeat resection of the portal fibrous tissue with resolution of jaundice, which allowed take-down of the biliostomy. At last follow-up 1 to 13 years postoperatively, all 17 patients were free of jaundice (94 percent of total). One patient in this group never had drainage of bile and eventually died from sepsis. In contrast, five of seven patients operated on after 10 weeks never had drainage of bile. Four of these patients died from hepatic failure and one from bleeding varices. Two patients initially had bile drainage and became anicteric, but thereafter, acute cessation of bile flow and reccurrence of jaundice occurred. Reoperation resulted in a definitive increase in bile flow in both of these patients. The modified Sawaguchi procedure is definitely preferable to liver transplantation as primary treatment in infants with biliary atresia, especially if operation is performed before the age of 10 weeks.\r"

Pure direct defects predominated (58 percent), tended to be at the tubercle (41.9 percent), and were relatively small (less than 4 cm in 77 percent of the patients). Recurrence was associated with a number of previous repairs but the rate was only 4.3 percent for the series with 11 of 18 patients having at least three repairs. The recurrence rate for first rerepair using this approach was 1.6 percent (4 of 248 patients) within 5 years for 80 percent of the patients followed. The preperitoneal approach is a useful, safe, and effective technique for the treatment of recurrent groin hernia and should be widely implemented.\r"

In addition to a total esophagectomy, two patients required a laryngectomy and seven patients had a total gastrectomy. Intraoperative bleeding occurred in three patients. Postoperative complications included subphrenic abscess (Candida) (2 patients), diaphragmatic hernia (1 patient), and salivary fistula (11 patients). Three patients died in the postoperative period from necrosis of interposed colon, pneumonia, and liver failure due to liver metastasis. The average blood loss was 1,300 ml, the duration of surgical procedure was 5.3 hours, and the hospital stay was 21 days. The survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 80 percent, 50 percent, and 33 percent, respectively. Transhiatal esophagectomy can be considered a sound alternative to transthoracic esophagectomy in the management of tumors involving the cervical and lower esophagus.

This retrospective review of 65 patients treated from 1975 to 1986 has revealed a 28 percent incidence of renal vein and vena caval involvement (each seen alone or in combination per patient), which was significantly higher than previously reported rates (6 to 8 percent). We attribute this to our evaluation of all patients preoperatively with arteriography and subsequent radiography of the vena cava in those suspected of having tumor thrombus in the renal vein, or vena cava, or both. We think arteriographic studies are more sensitive and reliable for assessment of vascular invasion than computerized tomography. There was a 100 percent follow-up of those patients with vascular invasion (mean, more than 5 years). The low survival rate in patients with nodal metastases (8 percent) has been noted previously, but the 87.5 percent survival rate in those patients with venous invasion without nodal involvement was considerably higher than what has been reported previously. We conclude that proper preoperative evaluation to diagnose vascular invasion will allow a carefully planned combined urologic and vascular surgical approach with removal of renal vein or vena caval tumor, while avoiding tumor thromboemboli during resection.\r"

No operative mortality occurred with en bloc resection. Survival after en bloc resection was influenced by Dukes' stage and the histologic documentation of cancer within the adherent organ. Unacceptably high local recurrence rates and poor 5 year survival rates were observed in cases where adherent organs were separated from the colorectal cancer. We conclude that colorectal cancer adherent to other organs should be treated by en bloc resection. The survival rate after en bloc resection will be comparable to the rate after standard colectomy for nonadherent colorectal cancers.\r"

  ".W": "During a 10 year period, we have had operative experience with 13 injuries to the subclavian artery. The factors that led to the successful management in 10 consecutive patients were analyzed. Nonspecific signs, such as pain and swelling, were present in all of the patients. Some aspect of vascular injury was present in each patient and included change in the quality of the distal pulse, hematoma, active hemorrhage, and bruit. Roentgenologic signs such as lung opacification, fractured clavicle, fracture of the first or second rib, and pulmonary opacification were present in each patient. Arteriograms were obtained from all stable patients in whom this injury was suspected. There were no false-positive or false-negative findings. The operative approach for the right subclavian vessels was midline sternotomy, whereas for exposure of proximal left subclavian injuries, anterolateral thoracotomy was utilized. Claviculectomy permitted excellent exposure for distal subclavian artery injuries. This exposure was associated with minimal blood loss and permitted direct repair of complex injuries of the arteries and veins. All patients who reached the emergency room with measurable vital signs survived, and all those who underwent subclavian vascular repair had circulation restored. Principal morbidity was due to associated brachial plexus and lung injuries. A high index of suspicion, rapid transportation, aggressive resuscitation, and proper surgical exposure and repair are essential for the successful management of these rare vascular injuries.\r"

  ".W": "Between February 1973 and December 1986, 4,787 patients underwent open heart surgery at Samuel Merritt Hospital. Retrospective analysis revealed 395 (8 percent) consecutive patients who required hemodynamic support with the intraaortic balloon pump. Thirty percent of the patients had preoperative placement, 56 percent needed the balloon in order to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass, and 14 percent required placement in the postoperative period. The intraaortic balloon pump was instituted with multiple techniques and insertion sites. Three hundred eighty-three balloon catheters (96 percent) were inserted through the groin by surgical cutdown or a percutaneous approach. The remaining devices were inserted through the aortic arch. A 12 F. catheter was utilized in 239 patients (61 percent) and a smaller 10.5 F. catheter was placed in 156 patients (39 percent). The hospital mortality rate was 47 percent. Seventy-two of the 395 patients (24 percent) sustained vascular complications related to balloon use. Major complications occurred in 43 patients. Twenty-nine patients sustained minor complications that resolved spontaneously with balloon removal. Risk factors evaluated included patient gender, New York Heart Association class, catheter size, method of introduction, duration of counterpulsation, and presence of symptomatic peripheral vascular disease. Since percutaneous placement was associated with a significant decrease in complications, we concluded that use of the smaller 10.5 F. catheter placed percutaneously is the safest means of employing the intraaortic balloon pump. A monitoring line is placed percutaneously through the femoral artery in high-risk patients before operation. This allows easier access for intraaortic balloon pump placement in hypotensive patients. The presence of a clinical history of peripheral vascular disease was also a highly significant risk factor for vascular complications. Other risk factors increasing the likelihood of vascular compromise included catheter size and duration of counterpulsation.\r"

A controlled in vitro environment of the rat diaphragm-phrenic nerve system was used for the studies. Concentrations of anticholinesterases spanned the clinical range and were extended beyond to establish dose-response curves. Neostigmine was the most potent reversal drug (ED50 for 95% block 5.5 +/- 4 nM), followed by pyridostigmine (0.27 +/- 0.06 microM) and edrophonium (2.1 +/- 0.05 microM). The three drugs were equally effective at reversal of block and fade as measured by train-of-four stimulation. The dose-response curves for all three drugs showed a ceiling effect for reversal of tension and fade. Supraclinical concentrations of drug did not effect complete reversal, especially at 95% block. High concentrations of anticholinesterase led to randomly appearing hyperactivity manifested by spontaneous twitching and repetitive firing with severe fade on stimulation.\r"

The lumbar subarachnoid administration of tetracaine, 5 mg dissolved in 1 ml of a 7.5% dextrose solution had no significant effect on either SCBF or CBF for 4 hr even though arterial blood pressure and heart rate decreased significantly. After subarachnoid epinephrine alone (100, 300, and 500 micrograms), SCBF varied widely but did not change significantly with any of the injections, nor did CBF. Responses of SCBF to hypercapnia and to acute blood loss during spinal anesthesia with tetracaine were also examined. Increased PaCO2 (from 35 to 57 mm Hg) increased both SCBF and CBF similarly before and after subarachnoid tetracaine; SCBF increased from 26.8 +/- 9.0 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 (mean +/- SD) before to 34.2 +/- 13.6 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 during hypercapnia during spinal anesthesia, which was almost identical to the increase (from 31.5 +/- 8.1 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 to 39.9 +/- 6.0 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1) before spinal anesthesia. Whereas acute blood loss (approximately 20% of estimated blood volume) during spinal anesthesia with tetracaine caused a 23% reduction of SCBF (P less than 0.05), in the absence of tetracaine SCBF remained unchanged during hemorrhagic hypovolemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the protective effect of oxprenolol-induced beta-blockade on the compromised myocardium (critical constriction of the left anterior descending coronary artery) against the adverse effect of high concentrations of halothane, halothane dose-response curves were obtained in six dogs in each of three phases: preconstriction (control), critical constriction, and critical constriction with the addition of 0.3 mg/kg intravenous oxprenolol. The extent of depression of ventricular function was essentially the same in the three phases. However, at high halothane concentrations (2.0% inspired), the depression of systolic shortening in the compromised segment was significantly minimized after oxprenolol so that shortening was 10.2% +/- 1.8 instead of 6.5% +/- 1.4 (P less than 0.05); moreover the large increase in postsystolic shortening observed during critical constriction was abolished after oxprenolol. This suggests a protective effect of oxprenolol on regional myocardial function in the presence of critical constriction, possibly by an effect on myocardial metabolism or endocardial blood flow.\r"

Intravenous dopamine (3 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) was administered to six healthy human subjects. Two hypoxic challenges (PETO2 = 52.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, SaO2 = 88.8 +/- 2.2%; mean +/- SD) were administered at three CO2 levels (PETCO2 = 40.8 +/- 0.5, 45.6 +/- 0.2, 49.8 +/- 0.3 mm Hg) to each subject. The ventilatory responses were quantified by calculation of slopes and intercepts of the relationship between minute exhaled ventilation (VE) and arterial hemoglobin saturation (SaO2), and by the relationship between this slope (delta VE/delta SaO2) and carbon dioxide tension. Dopamine caused a 77% reduction in delta VE/delta SaO2 (hypoxic sensitivity) during eucapnia, a 39.5% reduction in hypoxic sensitivity at PETCO2 = 46 mm Hg, and 38% reduction at PETCO2 = 50 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). Dopamine also reduced normoxic ventilation at all carbon dioxide levels. There was a greater depression in VE during hypercapnia (25.7% reduction) than during eucapnia (12% reduction). This indicates that dopamine depresses the normoxic ventilatory response to carbon dioxide. Intravenous dopamine reduces the ventilatory response to both hypoxia and hypercapnia but preserves the augmentation of hypoxic ventilatory drive by hypercapnia.\r"

During onset of blockade there was less fade with the larger than the smaller dose of vecuronium, demonstrating a variable and dose-related relationship between the ratio of height of the initial twitch, T1, and fourth twitch, T4. With both doses TOF fade was more pronounced during recovery than during onset of block, but at the same T1 values during offset, both doses were associated with similar degrees of fade during recovery. Thus with bolus doses of vecuronium the T4 ratio during recovery bears a fixed relationship to initial T1 depression that is independent of dose.\r"

The points at which the sympathetic chain and the lumbar arteries crossed were at the middle third of the vertebral body in both the second and third lumbar vertebra. These results suggest that the most suitable point for placement of the tip of the needle used for chemical lumbar sympathectomy is not the midpoint of a vertebral body, but rather the lower third of the second vertebral body or the upper third of the third vertebral body.\r"

In half the patients given caudal morphine, the morphine was mixed with a dose of lidocaine adequate to produce sacral analgesia, to confirm correct caudal injection of the morphine. Caudal injections were performed at the end of surgery. Time until the first required postoperative intravenous morphine dose was recorded for each patient. The duration of analgesia was significantly greater with caudal morphine (median 12 hr, P less than 0.02) than with caudal bupivacaine (median 5 hr), and both were greater than with intravenous morphine in control patients (median 45 min). Urinary retention, pruritis, and nausea appeared with slightly greater frequency in the caudal morphine group, but no delayed respiratory depression occurred. Caudal morphine (0.5 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/kg) provided 8-24 hr of analgesia in children without a significantly greater incidence of side effects than caudal bupivacaine or intravenous morphine.\r"

The devices tested were the Dial-A-Flo (DAF), Stat Master (SM), CorrectFlo (CFLO), and Arm-A-Flow (AAF). Five DAFs and five SMs were tested for accuracy at each of two flow settings. Accuracy is irrelevant for the CFLO and AAF, which have no metered dial. Flow rate for the DAF deviated from the 30-ml/hr setting by -25.1 +/- 7.2% (mean +/- SD) and from the 100 ml/hr setting by -23.4 +/- 3.5%. The SM deviation was -0.1 +/- 25.2% at a 10 ml/hr setting and -4.08 +/- 12.5% at the 100 ml/hr setting. Actual flow varied significantly with the individual DAF or SM unit employed. For all four devices, seven conditions of varying back pressure were modeled using different carrier flow rates and catheter clamps. Data from the DAFs, SMs, and CFLOs tested at the 100 ml/hr setting showed a linear relationship between flow rate and back pressure (r2 range, 0.82-0.88, P much less than 0.001). In contrast, AAF flow rate was relatively constant with changes in back pressure. We conclude that neither the DAF nor the SM metered dial provides accurate flow. The DAF, SM, and CFLO did not compensate for applied back pressure; the AAF did compensate for increasing back pressure, but was difficult to use. We cannot recommend any of the four brands tested for routine clinical use.\r"

Mice given pentobarbital 2 hr after receiving cyclosporine, 60 mg/kg, slept a statistically significant 2.3 times longer than did controls. In a second study, each of two dose levels of cyclosporine was given before each of four dose levels of fentanyl. The analgesic effect of fentanyl, measured with the abdominal constriction test, was dose-dependent. Cyclosporine significantly increased the analgesia produced by fentanyl and did so in a dose-dependent manner. Cyclosporine by itself did not produce analgesia. Plasma levels of fentanyl and binding of fentanyl by plasma proteins were unchanged by cyclosporine treatment. The results show that a single dose of cyclosporine can increase pentobarbital hypnosis and fentanyl analgesia in mice but do not establish the mechanism of these interactions.\r"

When midazolam in a dose range of 100-1000 micrograms was injected directly into the sinus node artery of the isolated atrium, biphasic (negative followed by positive) chronotropic and triphasic (positive, negative followed by positive) inotropic effects were induced. After propranolol or imipramine, the positive chronotropic and the secondary positive inotropic effects were significantly suppressed, but the initial positive inotropic effect was not affected. Tetrodotoxin, atropine, or R05-4864, a selective ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites, did not modify midazolam-induced effects. When midazolam in a dose of 0.1-1 mg/kg was administered intravenously to the donor dog, monophasic negative chronotropic and inotropic effects in the isolated atrium were observed but were not as prominent. We conclude that midazolam has direct cardiac inhibitory properties including catecholamine release due to a tyramine-like action.\r"

Three percent 2-CP with 0.07% or 0.2% BS was not toxic to peripheral nerves. Three percent 2-CP with 1.2% BS and 1.2% BS (pH 2.8) alone had an acute effect on the peripheral nerves but no chronic effect. Ten percent BS (pH 2.8) caused Wallerian degeneration. However, at pH 4.8, no chronic toxicity was observed. Using conductivity measurements, it was shown that 2-CP and BS, when mixed, form an ion pair in solution that lowers the effective concentration of BS.\r"

Cortical amplitudes decreased only insignificantly after stimulation of both dermatomes, despite the presence of sensory analgesia (pin prick) from T-3.5 +/- 0.4 to L-2.9 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SEM). Latency of the SEP components remained unchanged and sensory threshold increased only insignificantly during blockade. We conclude that thoracic epidural analgesia with conventional doses of bupivacaine provides only a limited blockade of fast conducting afferent nerve fibers.\r"

Preoperative steroid administration produced a significant increase in serum glucose level in acromegalic patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance, whereas in the other two groups no significant change in serum glucose level was found. After surgery started, there was a statistically significant increase in serum glucose level above baseline levels in all three groups. Serum GH levels decreased after commencement of surgery in acromegalic patients, and tumor manipulation did not produce a statistically significant increase in serum GH levels. Simultaneous increases in serum glucose and serum GH levels upon tumor manipulation did not occur in any group. We conclude that preoperative steroid administration in patients with high serum levels of GH in association with diabetes or glucose intolerance increases serum glucose levels, and that, after commencement of surgery, GH has only a minor role in the changes of serum glucose levels.\r"

Thirty women with term pregnancies undergoing general anesthesia for elective cesarean section or cesarean section indicated by cephalopelvic disproportion were randomly assigned to two groups. Group C-1 patients received 0.05 mg/kg of d-tubocurarine followed by 1.5 mg/kg of succinylcholine, and group C-2 patients received 1.5 mg/kg of succinylcholine, and group C-2 patients received 1 ml of normal saline followed by 1 mg/kg of succinylcholine. An investigator, unaware of the relaxant regimen used, judged severity of fasciculations and postoperative muscle pain and measured times to onset of and 50% recovery from neuromuscular blockade. This same study design was followed in a group of 30 women undergoing tubal ligation 1 day after vaginal delivery (groups T-1 and T-2). The incidence of both fasciculations and postoperative muscle pain was low and was not significantly different between pretreated and nonpretreated groups. Time to 100% twitch depression was also not significantly different between pretreated and nonpretreated groups. Time to 50% recovery from neuromuscular blockade was significantly longer in both nonpretreated groups (C-2 and T-2). An additional group of 15 patients undergoing general anesthesia for cesarean section using 0.7 mg/kg of succinylcholine without d-tubocurarine pretreatment was studied (group C-3). This smaller dose of succinylcholine produced onset and 50% recovery times similar to the group pretreated with d-tubocurarine (group C-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We tested whether toxic products were produced by the passage of sevoflurane through soda lime, and a comparison was made of the toxicity of sevoflurane passed through soda lime with the toxicity of other potent volatile anesthetics in current clinical use. Halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane (all in 1-MAC concentrations), or no anesthetic (control) were passed through soda lime for 4 hr with 12, 14, or 100% oxygen to groups of rats with hepatic microsomal enzyme induction. Separate groups of 12-13 rats were given 1 MAC of sevoflurane that had not passed through soda lime and either 14 or 100% oxygen. Sevoflurane was no more toxic than isoflurane and both of these anesthetics were less toxic than halothane. Soda lime was not a factor in any toxicity produced. Hepatic injury with all agents varied inversely with the oxygen concentration administered during anesthesia.\r"

Comparison of the cumulative responses to fluphenazine revealed no significant differences among the groups. However, the response (mean +/- SEM) to halothane in the NMS group (1.7 +/- 0.7 g), which was similar to the response in the MH group (1.5 +/- 0.2 g), was significantly greater than the response found in controls (0.2 +/- 0.1 g). In addition, five of seven NMS patients could be diagnosed as MH-susceptible, based on the development of muscle contractures greater than 0.7 g in response to 1-3% halothane. In contrast, none of the controls were MH-susceptible. These findings appear to correlate with clinical evidence suggesting an association between NMS and MH.\r"

Interactions between pentobarbital or thiopental and midazolam were found to be synergistic (supra-additive). The degree of synergism was almost identical with both combinations.

Group 1 was premedicated 90-120 min prior to induction with diazepam 0.15 mg X kg-1 po; group 2, in addition, received clonidine 5 micrograms X kg-1 po. Anesthetic depth was assessed by on-line aperiodic analysis of the electroencephalogram. Following lidocaine 1 mg X kg-1 and fentanyl 2 micrograms X kg-1 (group 1 only), anesthesia was induced with thiopental 3-4 mg X kg-1 and vecuronium 0.1 mg X kg-1 was used to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in N2O/O2 and supplemented by fentanyl. In group 2, clonidine produced a rapid preoperative control of systolic and diastolic BP from 166 +/- 32/95 +/- 14 to 136 +/- 80 +/- 11 (P less than 0.01), was more effective in blunting the reflex tachycardia associated with laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation than lidocaine-fentanyl pretreatment. It significantly reduced the intraoperative lability (coefficient of variation) of systolic (P less than 0.01) and diastolic BP and heart rate (HR) (P less than 0.05), and resulted in significantly slower HR during recovery (P less than 0.01). Anesthetic requirements for isoflurane were reduced 40% (P less than 0.01) in group 2; narcotic supplementation was also significantly reduced (P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Its practical use is to define the parameters required for a programmed infusion to maintain a desired plasma concentration. The method of deriving the Efflux function, which does not depend on conventional pharmacokinetic models, was developed and tested using thiopental and methohexital in a total of 51 unselected surgical patients free of hepatic or renal disease. Throughout a predetermined, known, but arbitrary computer-controlled drug infusion, the rate of which was modified according to patient lean body mass (LBM) and the desired concentration, blood samples were taken and the plasma assayed for either drug by an HPLC method. By dividing the known variable infusion rate at the time of each sampling by the arterial plasma concentration at each time, an estimate of the rate of loss of drug from the plasma at each point, the Plasma Drug Efflux, was obtained. An error correcting iterative process was used with successive groups of patients until the optimum infusion profile was achieved. Only three iteration steps were required to optimize the infusion profile for each drug. The optimized infusion profile for thiopental was 25.35e-.145t + 4.85e-.0148t + 8.8 ml X min-1 X kgLBM-1, and, for methohexital, 22.21e-.092t + 5.09e-.0121t + 15 ml X min-1 X kgLBM-1. It was concluded that the process of optimization under clinical conditions resulted in infusion profiles suitable for establishing and maintaining a designated arterial plasma concentration in adult surgical patients for periods up to 3 h.\r"

Plasma concentrations of the muscle relaxants were determined using a selective ion-monitoring mass spectrometric technique specific for the parent compound. For vecuronium, plasma clearance (3.7 +/- 1.0 and 5.2 +/- 0.8 ml X kg-1 X min-1, respectively), and volume of distribution at steady-state (179 +/- 31 and 244 +/- 38 ml X kg-1, respectively) were lower in the elderly than in young adults; values for distribution half-lives, elimination half-life, and sensitivity of the neuromuscular junction were similar for the two groups. For pancuronium, there were no statistically significant differences between groups for these pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters. However, there was a trend toward reduced clearance (20%) and prolonged elimination half-life (16%) in the elderly as compared to the younger patients. The authors conclude that healthy elective surgical patients between the ages of 70 and 84 yr of age do not differ markedly from younger adults in their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response to vecuronium and pancuronium.\r"

After insertion of a subarachnoid bolt for ICP monitoring and a radial arterial cannula for determination of blood pressure and blood gas tensions, six patients (group I) were randomly allocated to receive MTC 0.03 mg/kg 3 min before induction of general anesthesia with thiopental 4 mg/kg and nitrous oxide 70% in O2. Six other patients (group II) received saline 0.015 ml/kg instead of MTC, followed by the same induction sequence. After induction of anesthesia, ventilation was controlled by mask (PaCO2 = 40 mmHg +/- 2 SE), and arterial and intracranial pressures were allowed to stabilize. Four minutes after thiopental administration (7 min after MTC), after a 1-min period of relatively stable arterial pressure and ICP, Sch 1 mg/kg was administered as a bolus. ICP and blood pressure were recorded continuously until normal twitch tension was restored. In group I (MTC pretreatment), ICP did not change significantly from the mean value observed before Sch, 14 mmHg +/- 2 SE. In group II (saline pretreatment), ICP increased from 11 mmHg +/- 2 SE to 23 mmHg +/- 4 SE (P less than .05). This study not only confirms previous work showing that Sch may induce marked ICP increases in lightly anesthetized patients with intracranial mass lesions, but also indicates that pretreatment with a \"defasciculating\" dose of MTC can prevent these potentially deleterious ICP increases in patients known to be at risk.\r"

Three groups of pentobarbital anesthetized rats were studied: control (group 1), ischemia (group 2), and ischemia plus nimodipine pretreatment, 1 mg X kg-1 ip, 1 h prior to ischemia (group 3). Forebrain ischemia was induced with bilateral carotid clamping, administration of trimethaphan, and blood withdrawal to obtain a mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg. The carotid clamps were released and blood re-infusion was begun 9 min after the onset of an isoelectric EEG signal. Ten minutes later, determination of regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCGU) was begun by injecting 3H-2-deoxyglucose in saline. After 60 min of reperfusion, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was determined by the indicator fractionation method, using 14C-iodoantipyrine. The brain was divided into hemisphere, diencephalon, cerebellum, and brainstem. Tissue radioactivities were determined by standard techniques. Compared to group 1, hemispheric rCGU (mean +/- SEM, mumoles X 100 g-1) was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced in groups 2 and 3 (40 +/- 3 vs. 27 +/- 2 and 22 +/- 2). Hemispheric rCGU was not significantly different in groups 2 and 3. Group 2 exhibited significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced rCBF (mean +/- SEM, ml X 100 g-1 X min-1) in the hemispheres compared to control (85 +/- 6 vs. 135 +/- 17).

  ".W": "The effects of 1.0 and 1.5 minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC) of isoflurane on mean systemic arterial pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, total body oxygen consumption, myocardial oxygen consumption, and regional distribution of blood flow were studied in newborn lambs. Fractional extraction of oxygen for the total body and for the myocardium were calculated. MAC for isoflurane was first determined in eight lambs less than 10 days old. The mean value obtained was 1.51%. Six different lambs were used for cardiovascular study. Heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and mean systemic arterial pressure decreased significantly during isoflurane anesthesia. Mean systemic arterial pressure and cardiac output decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Heart rate decreased significantly at 1.0 MAC isoflurane, but no further at 1.5 MAC. Stroke volume decreased only at 1.5 MAC. Cardiac output and total body oxygen consumption decreased by similar amounts at 1.0 MAC. Although cardiac output fell further at 1.5 MAC, oxygen consumption did not. Fractional extraction of oxygen increased only at 1.5 MAC. Myocardial blood flow and oxygen consumption decreased in parallel at 1.0 MAC, with no significant change during 1.5 MAC. Myocardial fractional oxygen extraction did not change. Although blood flow to all six body regions decreased significantly from control at both concentrations of isoflurane, blood flow to all organs except the adrenal did not differ significantly during 1.0 and 1.5 MAC. The authors conclude that a decrease in oxygen requirement during isoflurane anesthesia results in an appropriate decrease in oxygen delivery, with no apparent diversion of cardiac output from non-vital to vital organs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors performed fiber type analysis using myosin ATPase stains on 31 fascicles of skeletal muscle from nine patients following contracture testing. There was no significant difference in fiber type composition between fascicles from MH negative (n = 5) and MH positive (n = 4) patients. Furthermore, examining each of the 31 fascicles, the authors found no correlation (P greater than .05) of contracture magnitude with percentage of either Type I or Type II fibers using the Pearson Product-Moment correlation calculation.

The RIA measurement of fentanyl by the two laboratories resulted in comparable values for both control samples and samples from patients in a range of 0.5-50 ng/ml. The GLC method agreed with both RIA measurements in the spiked control and patient samples.

The authors conducted a study in five rats using fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to see if major pharmacokinetic discrepancies are associated with the uptake, maintenance, and elimination of halothane from the brain. The rats underwent a 60-min period of halothane anesthesia. They employed a spatially selective NMR spectroscopy technique known as surface coil \"depth-pulsing\" to assure that the fluorine NMR signals originated in brain tissue, and not in the scalp, muscle, adipose tissue, and bone marrow that surround the brain. After the inspired anesthetic concentration was decreased to zero, the amplitude of the fluorine NMR signal decreased to 40% of its maximum value within 34 +/- 8.0 minutes (n = 5), rather than after 7 h as in the recent study, where the fluorine signal may have contained substantial contributions from metabolites or tissues outside the brain. Fluorine was barely detectable in all of the animals 90 min after stopping the administration of halothane. The authors' results are in agreement with model calculations and several other investigations.\r"

This investigation reconciles previous in vivo NMR studies of others, which observed a slow anesthetic washout, with invasive non-NMR studies that found a rapid washout, as predicted by perfusion-limited models of anesthetic uptake and elimination. Two NMR surface coil experiments were performed: in the first, a 1-cm surface coil was placed directly over the exposed dura to be certain that the washout was observed only from the brain; in the second, a 3-cm coil was placed noninvasively over the intact scalp to emulate previous NMR experiments. As in previous NMR experiments, a slow washout of isoflurane was observed with the large coil. The NMR signal that is observed with the large coil cannot be attributed solely to brain tissue. Fat surrounding the brain contributes significantly to the fluorine NMR spectra that are observed with the 3-cm coil, and its contributions lengthen the apparent washout time. A rapid washout of isoflurane from the rabbit brain was observed with the small coil, whose signal unambiguously arises only from brain tissue. The observed rapid washout is consistent with previous invasive biochemical measurements of anesthetic washout from the brain.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in dogs have demonstrated that massive doses of intravenous lidocaine (160 mg X kg-1) can inhibit cerebral oxygen metabolism to a greater degree when administered with pentobarbital than can pentobarbital alone. From these data, it was hypothesized that lidocaine decreases cerebral metabolism by two means: suppression of cortical electrical activity and stabilization of neuronal membranes, and it was suggested that lidocaine might provide protection for the ischemic brain. In an attempt to apply this property clinically, the effect of a lower, clinically tolerated dose of lidocaine (15 mg X kg-1) on cerebral oxygen metabolism and cerebral blood flow was examined in dogs receiving deep isoflurane anesthesia. Once maximal metabolic suppression, as reflected by an isoelectric EEG, was achieved with isoflurane (3% end-expired), the administration of this dose of lidocaine had little effect on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2). The CBF was 94 +/- 19 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1 during 3% isoflurane anesthesia, and was 102 +/- 11 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1 with the addition of lidocaine. The CMRO2 was 2.32 +/- 0.23 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1 during isoflurane anesthesia, and was 2.18 +/- 0.09 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1 following the administration of lidocaine. However, this dose of lidocaine did produce a derangement of cerebral metabolites. The cerebral concentration of ATP during 3% isoflurane anesthesia was 2.07 +/- 0.04 mumol X g-1 (cerebral ATP in normal unanesthetized dogs is 2.01 +/- 0.01 mumol X g-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In +PB cells, all three agents produced increases in VO2 which were largest at 1 MAC and progressively smaller at 2 and 3 MAC. At all three doses, VO2 increases were largest with enflurane (48% at 1 MAC), intermediate with halothane (24%), and smallest with isoflurane (11%). These anesthetic-induced VO2 increases were abolished by prior addition of a cytochrome P450 inhibitor (metyrapone) to the incubations. In -PB cells, all three agents produced slight and comparable decreases in VO2 at 1 MAC, with further decreases at 2 and 3 MAC. In +PB cell suspensions at steady states of O2 and energy metabolism, 1 MAC enflurane or halothane, but not isoflurane, produced significant declines in steady state PO2 (from initial values of 24 mmHg to values less than 10 mmHg) and reductions in adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate ratio (ATP/ADP). These changes were absent in -PB cells exposed to the same conditions or in +PB cells not exposed to anesthetic. The authors conclude that clinical doses of enflurane and, to a lesser extent, halothane produce statistically significant increases in O2 consumption, reflecting enhanced cytochrome P450 activity, in liver cells isolated from phenobarbital-treated rats. Such increases in O2 demand represent a mechanism by which anesthetic metabolism could contribute to intrahepatic hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study examines the effects of atracurium and vecuronium on 100 neurosurgical patients; 50 receiving chronic phenytoin therapy (group I) and 50 controls (group II). During O2/N2O/halothane anesthesia, five patients in each group were given a bolus of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg, and a different five patients in each group were given atracurium 0.5 mg/kg, to produce neuromuscular blockade in excess of 95%. The time to maximum blockade and the recovery from atracurium was unaffected by phenytoin therapy. Recovery from vecuronium was enhanced in the phenytoin group, as demonstrated by the recovery index, defined as the time required for recovery from 25-75% of the control neuromuscular response (7.9 +/- 2.2 min compared with 17.8 +/- 5.1 min in controls, P less than 0.005). Similarly, the total duration of neuromuscular blockade, defined as recovery to 90% of control response, was significantly shorter in the phenytoin group (31.9 +/- 6.0 min compared with 69.7 +/- 12.9 min in controls, P less than 0.001). The remaining 40 patients from each group were given a preselected dose of either vecuronium (0.02-0.06 mg/kg) or atracurium (0.10-0.25 mg/kg) during anesthesia with O2/N2O/fentanyl, to generate dose-response curves for the relaxants. Using analysis of covariance, the slopes and elevations for atracurium were found to be essentially identical in the two groups; as were the calculated ED50 and ED95. Patients receiving chronic phenytoin therapy were resistant to vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. With vecuronium, the dose-response curves for the two groups were parallel; the curve for phenytoin patients was shifted to the right.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using a Langendorff preparation in isolated guinea pig hearts, tissue 45Ca was measured after 40 and 60 min of loading with 45Ca, followed by 20 min of washout period. Myocardial ischemia was produced by a 30-min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). LAD occlusion caused an increase in 45Ca content in the anterior left ventricular muscle (ischemic area) of 215% compared to that of the posterior left ventricular muscle (normal myocardium). The increase in 45Ca content in the ischemic area was significantly less (P less than 0.05) in the presence of halothane (1%) compared to the non-halothane group. Halothane did not significantly alter 45Ca content in the non-ischemic myocardium. Myocardial injury associated with calcium paradox, which was produced by a 10-min perfusion of the heart with calcium-free Krebs solution followed by normal calcium repletion, caused a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in the 45Ca content compared to control. Addition of halothane (1%) significantly depressed (P less than 0.05) the increase in 45Ca content caused by calcium paradox. It is suggested that halothane might inhibit calcium accumulation associated with myocardial ischemia and calcium paradox under certain experimental situations. The inhibitory effect of halothane on calcium accumulation may be beneficial for the ischemic heart during halothane anesthesia.\r"

Five sets of cardiovascular data were recorded in each patient. In the awake, unmedicated state prior to induction, at three different anesthetic levels, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 MAC (corrected for age) and a final measurement repeated at 1.25 MAC after the intravenous infusion of 15 ml X kg-1 of Lactated Ringers solution. The study was completed prior to intubation and surgery. Results are expressed as mean +/- SEM. Isoflurane and halothane decreased mean blood pressure from the awake level (isoflurane 76.6 +/- 2.3 to 60.6 +/- 3.1 mm, halothane 72.2 +/- 3.9 to 60.6 +/- 3.1 mm at 1.25 MAC). Isoflurane increased heart rate at all anesthetic levels (128.7 +/- 4.2 to 142.5 +/- 6.0 beats/min at 0.75 MAC). Halothane decreased heart rate at 1.25 MAC (124.6 +/- 4.6 to 119.4 +/- 3.5 beats/min).

Thirty-one patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were anesthetized with fentanyl 0.1 mg X kg-1, and were randomly allocated to one of three groups: control (no further anesthetics during bypass and continuous EEG activity), thiopental treatment (EEG suppression), or isoflurane treatment (EEG suppression). Hypothermia (25-29 degrees C) was routinely induced at onset of nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass. In the treatment groups, thiopental or isoflurane were used during bypass to achieve a deep burst suppression pattern. Cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were determined during hypothermia and upon rewarming to normothermia (37 degrees C). Pharmacologic EEG suppression with either isoflurane or thiopental was associated with lower cerebral metabolic rate than control values during both hypothermic and normothermic bypass. However, only thiopental-induced EEG suppression was associated with lower cerebral blood flow than control. Cerebral blood flow during isoflurane-induced EEG suppression was similar to control values in spite of the reduced cerebral metabolic rate.\r"

Arterial and venous concentrations of propranolol remained constant during the experiment in the group of dogs anesthetized only with pentobarbital. However, there was a rapid increase in arterial propranolol concentration from 88 +/- 10 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM) prior to halothane to 116 +/- 12 ng/ml (P less than 0.05) and 130 +/- 7 ng/ml (P less than 0.05) 60 and 120 min, respectively, after starting halothane anesthesia (2.0 MAC 1.74%). The increase in venous propranolol concentration lagged substantially behind that of the arterial concentration, so that, 60 min after starting halothane, the arterial to venous (A/V) concentration ratio increased from 1.13 +/- 0.05 to a maximum of 1.48 +/- 0.08. In contrast to the changes following halothane, no significant change in the A/V ratio occurred following fentanyl. Both halothane and fentanyl administration produced a small but significant increase in the free fraction of propranolol (P less than 0.05). The results from this study emphasize the importance of the choice of sampling sites in pharmacokinetic experiments, as well as excluding subtle pharmacokinetic changes during anesthesia before ascribing changes in drug effect to changes in sensitivity to the drug.\r"

  ".W": "Endotracheal tube (ETT) fire has been reported secondary to laser and electrocautery ignition. The flammability of polyvinylchloride (PVC), silicone (Si), and red rubber (RR) ETTs in oxygen (O2) and/or nitrous oxide (N2O) in nitrogen was determined and compared by means of the O2 and N2O indices of flammability. The O2 index of flammability is the minimum O2 fraction in nitrogen that will support candle-like flame using a standard ignition source. The O2 index of flammability for PVC ETTs is 0.263, for Si 0.189, and for RR 0.176. The N2O index of flammability is the minimum N2O fraction in N2 that will support candle-like flame using a standard ignition source. The N2O index of flammability for PVC ETTs is 0.456, for Si ETTs 0.414, and for RR ETTs 0.374. The indices are additive. Flammability is a valid method of comparing safety of various endotracheal tube materials. There is a need for new endotracheal tube material with a higher index of flammability. The significance of these findings and the clinical applications are discussed.\r"

After immunochemical and biochemical characterization, the reference preparation was used to produce allergen reference paper disks. Their quality was controlled by the amount of bound protein and serum titration, which should yield an S-shaped dose-response curve and specific binding of IgE of at least ten times more than background binding. In parallel, the biologic activity of the allergen reference preparations was established in quantitative skin prick tests in at least 20 allergic patients. From these patients, serum samples were collected and pooled after careful characterization. All three necessary reagents for RAST-inhibition (extract, disks, and serum pool) were stabilized by freeze-drying. The reproducibility of the assay procedure itself was checked by documenting the 50% inhibition value of the reference preparation, accepting only values within +/- 2 SD. By employing such reagents we could measure the activity of alum-adsorbed grass pollen extracts with sufficient precision, ie, the coefficient of variation of the mean potency of 12 batches was less than 40%.\r"

The best experimental extracts detected Epicoccum sensitivity in 70% of the group tested while the commercial extract detected sensitivity in only 6%. Skin reaction correlations were greatest within isolates (eg, spore-A/mycelium-A), then for specific fungus parts (eg, spore-A/spore-B), then between isolates and parts (spore-A/mycelium-B). High correlations were found between individual IgG and IgE ELISA values for all antigens using serum from Epicoccum skin-reactive patients. ELISA inhibition results suggested that significant cross-reactivity exists between Epicoccum and Alternaria antigens recognized by IgG but not by IgE. ELISA inhibition cross-reaction patterns among Epicoccum antigens were comparable to skin reactions while IgG patterns showed little variability. Further characterization of spore/mycelium and interstrain recognition patterns among different immunoglobulin isotypes will be necessary before complete standardization of extracts from different parts of fungi will be possible. The use of spore material for skin testing and treatment of Epicoccum sensitivity appears to be both premature and unnecessary at this time.\r"

During the years 1982 and 1983 all of the cases of chronic asthma or rhinitis exhibiting a positive immediate skin response (greater than or equal to 10 mm) to one of these three antigens were selected for this study (60 asthma and 75 rhinitis). They all went through nasal and bronchial provocation tests with the specific antigen. Late reactions were also registered. A RAST was performed in some of the patients reacting to Candida albicans. Following inhalation challenge with antigens, an immediate response was obtained in 91 cases (asthma 30, rhinitis 51). A dual response was observed in 17 cases of asthma and in 13 cases of rhinitis. A RAST-Candida albicans was done in 64 cases. Results were positive in 52 patients. In 46 cases there was a correlation between the RAST and the provocation tests. Hyposensitization treatment was given to 92 patients. After 2 years of treatment, a good to excellent response could be observed in almost 60% of the treated cases. A rough estimation of the incidence of immediate bronchial and nasal hypersensitivity among patients with chronic asthma and rhinitis to the three yeasts gives the approximate figure of 8% to 10%.\r"

  ".W": "In order to estimate the extent of dynamic compression in patients with COPD who were flow-limited at rest, we measured tidal expiratory flows before and after application of small expiratory resistive loads (ERL). We sought also to evaluate the compensatory strategies available to such patients during ERL by measuring steady-state ventilatory responses. Nine patients with severe COPD (FEV1 +/- SE, 27 +/- 3% predicted) completed the study. Mean tidal flow-volume plots representing all breaths analyzed during 4 min of ERL (resistance, 8 cm H2O/L/s) and unloaded control (4 min) were compared at isoabsolute volume in each individual subject. In 6 subjects, ERL resulted in appreciable reduction of expiratory flows throughout the tidal volume (VT) when compared with volume-matched flows during control. In the remaining subjects, expiratory flows during loading and control coincided during part of the VT. In the group as a whole at 50, 30, and 10% of VT during ERL, when mouth pressure was increased by 3, 2.5, and 2 cm H2O, respectively, flow rates were significantly lower than volume-matched flows during control (delta V, = 0.10, 0.09 and 0.06 L/s, respectively). Minute ventilation was reduced significantly by ERL, but only small insignificant changes in breathing pattern parameters occurred. End-expiratory volume increased by 0.1 L +/- 0.02 (p less than 0.005). We conclude that the majority of patients with chronic air-flow limitation do not sustain significant dynamic compression at rest, and loading response to ERL in patients with COPD are attenuated when compared with those in normal subjects.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the accuracy of a new system for deriving standard spirometric indices, maximal expiratory flow rates, and slope ratios from volume-time tracings. A computer-based technique employing a hand-operated cursor was used to put discrete values of volume and time into a memory array. Spirometric values obtained on 102 subjects using the computer system were compared with the corresponding \"hand-read\" values. The difference between the 2 measuring techniques were not significant for the FVC, the FEV75, and the FEF25-75; however, the average FEV1 differed by 6.7 ml (SD, 20.3 ml), which was significant. In addition, 10 subjects performed FVC maneuvers through a spirometer and flowmeter connected in series. Flows and slope ratios obtained from the volume-time tracings were compared with those obtained directly from the flowmeter. There was a high degree of correlation between the 2 types of flow measurements (r = 0.989), whereas slope ratios were less well correlated (r = 0.589). Configurational detail such as the presence of \"bumps\" on slope ratio versus volume plots were recovered with the computer technique. Using this new system, it is possible for 1 operator to process 10 to 12 sets of spirometry tracings per hour.\r"

  ".W": "Qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed on phospholipids isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during the development of pulmonary fibrosis in the rat. A single transtracheal injection of 2.0 units of bleomycin was administered to rats to induce lung injury. Animals were killed at 0, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 120 days after bleomycin treatment. Total lipid phosphorus in BAL from animals given bleomycin increased from 1.6 mumol/lung in normal animals to 3.2 mumol/lung at 14 and 30 days. The increase in phospholipids was primarily in phosphatidylcholine with minor increases in phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine. These quantitative changes were accompanied by qualitative changes that included an increase in the percentage of total phosphatidylcholine, disaturated phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositol. In contrast, the percentage of phosphatidylglycerol was significantly reduced. Plasma phospholipid analysis indicated that these alterations were not due to plasma contamination. The functional significance of the phospholipid changes was assessed by comparing air- and saline-filled compliance measurements at similar times after bleomycin. Abnormal compliance measurements were observed at 3, 7, and 14 days after bleomycin. At 3 and 7 days the predominant compliance defect was at the air-liquid interface; however, at 14 days, when phospholipids were significantly elevated, the defect was primarily due to tissue components.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A model for pulmonary interstitial fibrosis (PIF) based on cell-mediated immune response is described. Animals were primed for contact hypersensitivity responses by skin painting with trinitrophenol (TNP), but instead of challenging with the antigen on the skin, animals were challenged with a single intratracheally administered dose of the immunizing hapten. Primed animals developed inflammation followed by pulmonary fibrosis, as determined by histologic examination. Furthermore, immunized animals developed an increase in hydroxyproline (as an indirect measure of collagen synthesis) that could be recovered from the lung by 7 days after an intratracheal challenge with TNP. The increase in hydroxyproline within the lung persisted through 30 days. The response was specific because little or no fibrosis or increase in collagen deposition was observed in immune animals that were challenged with an unrelated hapten (dinitrophenol). Unimmunized animals demonstrated a slight increase in hydroxyproline in the lung 7 days after challenge, but with time the collagen content of these control animals approached normal levels. These studies demonstrate that a specific cell-mediated immune response to a hapten within the lung can induce pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.\r"

Although numerous indirect studies have cast doubt on this theory, none of these previous investigations has been able to directly measure changes in beta-receptor number on intrapulmonary structures capable of affecting the physiologic changes seen in this disease state. To help clarify the intrapulmonary location of such changes, a model of allergic bronchoconstriction was prepared by sensitizing guinea pigs to ovalbumin intraperitoneally (ip) 2 wk prior to testing (Group S). A second group of animals was sensitized to ovalbumin, then 2 wk later partially desensitized (Group D) during a 4- to 6-wk period by repeated exposure to increasing doses of nebulized ovalbumin with epinephrine rescue. Control animals received ip administered and nebulized normal saline alone. Pulmonary function assessed by plethysmography revealed an increase in airway resistance to 294 +/- 42% (SE) of control in Group S (p less than 0.005) and a decrease in dynamic compliance to 76 +/- 8% of control in Group D and 39 +/- 10% of control in Group S (p less than 0.002) after exposure to nebulized ovalbumin. Using L-[3H] dihydroalprenolol ([3H] DHA), beta-receptors were autoradiographically localized and quantitated in lung sections from all 3 groups. Significant decreases (p less than 0.02) in 3H-DHA binding were noted in alveolar and conducting airway epithelium, and bronchiolar and vascular smooth muscle in ovalbumin-exposed animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Similar studies were performed in a control group of 8 nonimmunocompromised patients. Hemosiderin content in Prussian-blue-stained alveolar macrophages obtained by BAL was graded using a numerical scale. This \"hemosiderin score\" correlated closely with the degree of hemorrhage seen in corresponding histologic sections in the 26 patients from whom a lung biopsy or autopsy specimen was available. Severe pulmonary hemorrhage was ultimately diagnosed in 14 cases, and a mild degree of hemorrhage was found in an additional 19 cases. Thrombocytopenia and invasive fungal infections were statistically associated with severe hemorrhage, as was an increased percentage of alveolar macrophages in the BAL sample. This study demonstrates the efficacy of BAL in diagnosing occult pulmonary hemorrhage in the immunosuppressed host and highlights risk factors associated with hemorrhage in this setting.\r"

We describe 2 patients with predominantly basal interstitial fibrosis, disabling dyspnea, and severe hypoxemia who demonstrated this positional oxygenation change. Large or surgically correctable arteriovenous malformations (AVM), or intracardiac shunts, were not demonstrated in either patient. This finding has important implications for oxygen prescription and the explanation of positional dyspnea.\r"

The records have been reviewed in 44 consecutive patients in whom 53 small-bore catheters were placed for thoracic disease, including empyema, 20; effusion, 9; pneumothorax, 10; lung abscess, 4; and mediastinal cyst, 1. Insertion was performed under fluoroscopy in 88%, computed tomography in 6%, and ultrasonography in 6%. Catheters ranged in size from 6.5F to 12F, but catheter size did not seem to influence outcome (p = 0.6). There was complete resolution of the problem in 75% (33 of 44) of the patients, although 20% of them required more than one catheter. Treatment was successful in all cases of lung abscess. These patients had been previously treated with standard medical therapy for 12 to 53 days without significant improvement in their clinical condition. Patients with empyema composed the largest group treated. Eighty percent (16 of 20) of them had a loculated (LOC) process. The LOC group appeared to have a slightly better success rate than did the non-LOC group (75 versus 50%, p = 0.33). When the catheters failed to resolve the problem (empyema, 6; chylous effusion, 1; malignant effusion, 3; and spontaneous pneumothorax, 1, either operation (9.1%) or a standard thoracostomy tube (13.6%) was required. The complications rate was 20%, but most of these were minor problems including pneumothorax, 5; catheter occlusion 3; fractured catheter, 1; infection, 1; and significant subcutaneous emphysema, 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
