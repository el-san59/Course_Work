  ".W": "Between 1968 and 1985, 114 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue were evaluated in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Virginia (Charlottesville, VA); of these, 86 received treatment with curative intent. The majority were treated with radiation therapy alone, whereas the remainder were treated with radiation therapy with preoperative or postoperative surgery. There were 17 T1 primary malignancies, 40 T2, 27 T3, and 2 T4. Clinically positive adenopathy was present in 48% of the patients overall and ranged from 35% in the T1 group to 100% in the T4 group. Twenty-six percent of patients either presented with or later had second malignancies. At 36 months, the patient status was evaluated as dead of disease (37%), dead of intercurrent disease (23%), alive with disease (1%), and alive without evidence of disease (38%). Seventy-five patients received external beam therapy and 32 patients received an implant as either all or part of their treatment. Average doses were in the range of 6000 Gy. Adjusted local control rate at 3 years was not statistically different for different treatment techniques used on either T1 or T2 primary malignancies. The rates were 89% versus 88% for T1 lesions treated with definitive radiation therapy versus postoperative radiation therapy. For T2 primary malignancies, the rates were 67%, 71%, and 83% for the definitive, preoperative, and postoperative radiation therapy groups, respectively. For T3 lesions, there was close to statistical significance with the corresponding rates being 47%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. When the effect of implants was examined for T1 and T2 lesions, no difference in local control rate at 3 years was noticed with or without an implant. Survival was improved for the group presenting with positive neck disease when compared with the N0 group. The external beam severe complication rate was less than 5%, and the implant complication rate was 6%.\r"

Recurrent disease occurred at a median of 18 months from primary treatment, and was at the primary tumor site in 31 and metastatic to regional lymph nodes in 16. Recurrences were squamous cell carcinomas in 42 and adenoid cystic in five. Surgical resection left microscopic residual disease in 41 and gross residual in six. All patients received IORT with a median of 20 Gy. Two-year actuarial survival is 54.9%, and 15 patients are alive and disease free with a median survival of 29 months. Two-year actuarial local control is 61.5%. A trend toward increased survival (P less than 0.09) and local recurrence control (P = 0.05) was noticed when treating microscopic residual disease as opposed to gross residual disease. Perioperative mortality was seen in 8.5% and there was no increase in morbidity secondary to IORT. The authors believe that surgical resection and IORT is an effective treatment modality for head and neck cancers recurrent in previously irradiated fields and is adaptable to tertiary care hospitals.\r"

  ".U": "91223451\r", 
  ".W": "Twenty-five squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines from 20 patients with head and neck cancer were assessed for radiosensitivity in vitro using a 96-well plate assay. Four non-SCC lines were also tested. Radiation sensitivity of individual cell lines was compared using the area under the survival curve (AUC) as a measure of the mean inactivation dose. Tumor lines were tested with either a cobalt-60 (60Co) gamma-irradiator having a dose rate of 100 cGy/minute or with a 4-meV photon beam having a dose rate of 200 cGy/minute. The mean AUC of the 25 SCC cell lines was 188 +/- 7 (SEM) cGy (range, 100 to 250 cGy) whereas the four non-SCC lines had a mean AUC of 225 +/- 9 cGy. The SCC cell lines with mean inactivation dose values greater than 188 cGy were classified as relatively radioresistant whereas those with values less than 188 cGy were considered relatively radiosensitive. In seven cases SCC cell lines were derived from patients who had already received radiation therapy. In four of these cases the tumor cell lines were radioresistant (AUC, 210 to 250) but in the other three cases the tumor lines were radiosensitive (AUC, 160 to 180). Thus, failure of a tumor to respond to radiation did not always select for radioresistant cells. The mean of the AUC for cell lines from previously irradiated patients (197 +/- 11 cGy) did not differ significantly from that of the cell lines from patients who received no prior radiation therapy (182 +/- 9 cGy). However, among radiation-resistant lines those from the four previously irradiated patients were significantly more resistant (mean AUC = 235 +/- 9) than seven other radioresistant lines from nonirradiated patients (mean AUC, 208 +/- 4) (P = 0.0194). In four cases more than one cell line was derived from different tumor specimens in the same patient. In each of these cases the lines from the same patients were similar to one another in their degree of radioresistance. Based on these observations the authors conclude that the degree of in vitro radiation resistance is an inherent property of some squamous cell tumors.\r"

All of the patients had T4 tumors or massively recurrent disease with base of skull or facial bone involvement. Twelve patients were treated with curative intent receiving total doses of 6000 to 6960 cGy (modal 6750 cGy), whereas two patients were treated with less than 5000 cGy as palliation. Eleven of the 12 patients (92%) achieved a complete response, and 7 of 12 (58%) are alive at 35 to 72 months (mean, 47 months). Five patients are alive with no evidence of disease, and two with a local recurrence. Three patients died of distant disease, and two died from a local recurrence. When the response to treatment was analyzed based on tumor volume and radiation dose, only two of nine lesions measuring between 4 to 10 cm failed locally. The two palliative patients had almost complete local clearance of the disease but died at 2 and 8 months, respectively. In nine patients, the eye or optic nerve was included in the treatment field and received between 2000 to 6960 cGy. Only one of these nine patients had ophthalmic complication and this was confined to the cornea.\r"

Seventeen patients with AIDS and biopsy-proven CNS lymphoma were treated with whole-brain radiation. At presentation, most patients were severely debilitated from previous AIDS-related illnesses. Patients generally had focal neurologic symptoms such as seizures and paralysis. Headaches and mental status changes, often noticed after hospital admission, seldom brought our patients to seek medical attention. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed low-density, contrast-enhancing, mass lesions with variable amounts of peritumor edema. Size, location, and pattern of contrast enhancement of the lesions varied. No specific pattern was seen that could be used to distinguish between CNS lymphoma, toxoplasmosis, or other CNS diseases that occur in patients with AIDS. Biopsy results showed angiocentric, high-grade, large cell tumors with frequent necrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed B-cell phenotype with small amounts of T-cells, presumably reactive. All patients received irradiation to the whole brain with parallel opposed fields. A variety of doses and treatment regimens were used. Mean survival was only 72 days. Survival was longer in patients with higher pretreatment Karnofsky scores. The correlation between dose and survival was not significant. At completion of therapy, most patients showed improvement in Karnofsky score and had partial improvement in neurologic symptoms. CNS lymphomas in patients with AIDS are responsive to radiation. Posttreatment CT scans showed regression of tumors. Autopsy examinations showed regression of tumors, but also showed concurrent CNS infections, AIDS encephalopathy, and radiation-induced changes within the normal CNS tissue. Opportunistic infections rather than cerebral herniation or uncontrolled lymphoma was the most common cause of death.\r"

  ".U": "91223455\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1970 and 1989, 17 children with histologically malignant intracranial ependymomas received treatment at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA). Eleven were treated with prophylactic cranial or craniospinal irradiation plus a local boost (CS-XRT), five with local (L-XRT) irradiation only, and one was treated without (NRT) irradiation. With a median survival of 2 years and a median follow-up time for long-term survivors of 6.0 years, five of 11 patients who received CS-XRT are alive compared with none treated with L-XRT and none treated with NRT. Two-year actuarial survival rates are 40% (L-XRT) and 52% (CS-XRT). When examined for other factors, age and local radiation dose remain the most significant prognostic indicators of survival. The 2-year actuarial survival for children younger than 4 years at diagnosis is 20% compared with 83% for their older counterparts. Likewise, the 2-year survival for patients treated with local radiation doses over 4500 cGy was 55% compared with 0% for patients treated with lesser doses. To date there are a total of 28 recurrences. All have occurred with local components except for six (unknown) who died before the exact site(s) could be determined. There is no significant difference in the failure rates outside the original tumor bed in the three groups. These data suggest that local relapse remains the most significant component of failure. Because intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as age and radiation dose seem to be interrelated and at least as important as the use of craniospinal irradiation, the need for prophylactic treatment for children with anaplastic ependymoma could neither be substantiated nor refuted. The use of local radiation alone, however, should be restricted to carefully designed clinical trials in which meticulous pretreatment evaluation is performed, and vigilant posttreatment evaluation of the spine and brain is mandatory.\r"

  ".W": "Histologic classification and treatment of pediatric cerebellar astrocytomas is an area of controversy. At the Medical College of Wisconsin, 34 patients less than 15 years of age (median, 7.3 years of age) with cerebellar astrocytomas were seen from 1965 to 1988. Effect of histologic condition and treatment on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed. Progression was defined as radiographic evidence of an enlarging mass and/or signs and symptoms indicative of advancing disease. Histologic material was reviewed and classified by the system of Winston and Gilles. Twenty-eight patients had glioma A tumors, and six patients had glioma B tumors. For patients with glioma A (n = 28), 5-year actuarial OS rate was 100%. For patients with glioma B (n = 6), 5-year actuarial OS rate was 41%. PFS rate was 66% and 0% for patients with glioma A and glioma B, respectively. The poorer PFS for patients with B histologic tumors was statistically significant (P less than 0.001). The median time to progression was 36 months and 23 months for patients with glioma A and B, respectively. Patients were retrospectively divided into total resection and observation, total resection and irradiation, subtotal resection and observation, and subtotal resection and irradiation groups, which were composed of 12, 2, 3, and 17 patients, respectively. Five-year actuarial OS rates were 100%, 50%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. PFS rates were 60%, 50%, 33% and 58%, respectively. These data support the Gilles classification as a prognostic tool because patients with B tumors had a higher incidence of disease progression and accounted for all deaths. Postoperative irradiation after subtotal resection seems to be beneficial, but additional investigation, ideally with a prospective randomized trial, will be necessary to firmly establish this.\r"

Patients received standardized external radiation therapy to the pelvis or to the pelvis and PA lymph nodes followed by one or two brachytherapy applications. To date, no statistically significant differences in progression-free interval (PFI) or survival time have been identified between the randomization treatment arms on any of these studies. Basic similarities among these studies led us to pool these data to identify patient characteristics and tumor characteristics associated with an increased risk of treatment failure. Multi-variate analysis showed patient age, performance status (PS), PA lymph node status, tumor size, and pelvic node status to be significantly associated with PFI. When modeling for survival, all these factors and clinical stage and bilateral extension were significant.\r"

Five-year survival was 98% for patients with tumors less than or equal to 2 cm, 84% with tumors more than 2 cm, and 64% with tumors involving the whole uterine cavity (Mantel-Cox P = 0.005). For endometrial cancer patients with Grade 2 tumors and less than one-half myometrial invasion, the risk of lymph node metastasis is often considered too low to justify adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy. This intermediate-risk group is better defined by including tumor size as a prognostic factor. For this subgroup (Grade 2, less than one-half endometrial invasion) there were no lymph node metastasis associated with tumors less than 2 cm, but 18% had nodal disease when tumors were larger than 2 cm. Tumor size is an important prognostic factor that is particularly helpful in directing adjuvant radiation therapy in patients without staging lymph node biopsies.\r"

  ".W": "Until recently long-term renal toxicity has not been considered a major late complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Late renal dysfunction has been described in a pediatric population status post-BMT which was attributable to the radiation in the preparatory regimen. A thorough review of adults with this type of late renal dysfunction has not previously been described. Fourteen of 103 evaluable adult patients undergoing allogeneic (96) or autologous (7) bone marrow transplantation, predominantly for leukemia and lymphomas, at the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI) have had a syndrome of renal insufficiency characterized by increased serum creatinine, decreased glomerular filtration rate, anemia, and hypertension. This syndrome developed at a median of 9 months (range, 4.5 to 26 months) posttransplantation in the absence of specific identifiable causes. The cumulative probability of having this renal dysfunction is 20% at 1 year. Renal biopsies performed on seven of these cases showed the endothelium widely separated from the basement membrane, extreme thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, and microthrombi. Previous chemotherapy, antibiotics, and antifungals as well as cyclosporin may add to and possibly potentiate a primary chemoradiation marrow transplant renal injury, but this clinical syndrome is most analogous to clinical and experimental models of radiation nephritis. This late marrow transplant-associated nephritis should be recognized as a potentially limiting factor in the use of some intensive chemoradiation conditioning regimens used for BMT. Some selective attenuation of the radiation to the kidneys may decrease the incidence of this renal dysfunction.\r"

The authors have reviewed their experience with specific reference to the outcome of those patients whose breast cancer was detected on routine screening mammography. To achieve adequate follow-up, only patients treated before December 1984 are included in this analysis. Of 438 patients treated with CS & RT before December 1984, a total of 41 patients (9%) had nonpalpable lesions detected on routine screening mammography and were treated with CS & RT to the intact breast. Only two patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy and no patients received adjuvant systemic therapy. There has been only one breast failure and one death due to cancer in this group of patients resulting in actuarial survival and breast recurrence-free rates of 100% at 5 years and 92% at 10 years. These results stress the importance of routine screening mammography and raise questions regarding the role of adjuvant systemic therapy in this selected group of patients.\r"

A significant incidence of necrosis (56%) was observed in the breast ducts containing intraductal carcinoma. This was characterized by one or more areas of necrosis surrounded by a rim of viable tumor cells. The mean diameter of the ducts containing intraductal carcinoma was 349 microns compared with a mean diameter of 90 microns for the normal ducts. The mean diameter of the ducts containing necrosis was 470 microns compared with a mean diameter of 192 microns for the ducts containing a solid pattern of intraductal carcinoma. Central necrosis occurred in 94% of the ducts more than 180 microns in radius, whereas only 34% of the ducts less than 180 microns in size contained necrosis. The width of the viable neoplastic tissue was less than 180 microns in 91% of the ducts. These results are analogous to the findings of Thomlinson and Gray in human lung tumor cords and provide indirect evidence for the existence of a hypoxic compartment in intraductal carcinoma of the breast. This could be an explanation for the higher local failure rate after conservative surgery and irradiation for infiltrating cancers containing an extensive intraductal component.\r"

This study examines the clinical course of 32 patients who received a second course of radiation for soft tissue sarcoma. Four groups of patients were defined by the sequence of radiation (preoperative and postoperative) and surgery. Despite high cumulative doses of radiation, complications requiring amputation were rare. Local tumor control was achieved with a second course of preoperative radiation and wide local excision in 15 of 18 (84%). However, local excision and a second course of postoperative radiation resulted in eight of 14 (57%) local failure and cannot be recommended as a comparable therapy to amputation.\r"

  ".W": "The Cooperative Ewing's Sarcoma Studies, CESS 81 and CESS 86, are multiinstitutional trials with more than 80 participating institutions from Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and Switzerland. Treatment consists of four courses of multiagent chemotherapy and local therapy. Local therapy was not randomized and was either radical surgery or resection plus postoperative irradiation or definitive radiation therapy. Here results according to local therapy have been analyzed for 93 protocol patients with localized Ewing's sarcoma (ES) who have been recruited in CESS 81 from January 1981 to February 1985 and 122 protocol patients recruited in CESS 86 from January 1986 to November 1989. The 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 55% in CESS 81 and 62% in CESS 86. In CESS 81, the RFS was better for surgically treated than for irradiated patients. In this study there was an extremely high incidence of local failures (50%) after definitive irradiation. In CESS 86, however, the results after radiation therapy have been improved markedly (3-year RFS 67% after radiation therapy, 65% after surgery, and 62% after resection plus irradiation). Possible explanations for the improvement of radiotherapeutic results are as follows: selections for patients for radiation therapy, start of local therapy, and quality of radiation therapy. In CESS 86, irradiated patients were randomized to receive either conventionally fractionated irradiation with less intense chemotherapy or hyperfractionated irradiation with simultaneous chemotherapy. There was no difference in treatment results at the time of analysis. The authors conclude that selection of patients for local treatment modalities and quality of treatment performance has an impact on local and overall treatment results in ES.\r"

It is unclear whether the route or schedule of DDP administration was responsible for the observed therapeutic benefit. To resolve this issue, tumor and normal tissue platinum (Pt) levels were determined in rats bearing hind-limb rat mammary tumors after intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial (IA) DDP infusions of constant dose and varying lengths. Infusions of DDP at 6 mg/kg were conducted IA over 30 minutes, and 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours and IV over 30 minutes and 48 hours. After infusion, Pt concentrations in solubilized tissue homogenates were measured by flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy. Maximum tumor Pt levels were seen after 48-hour IA infusion (29.3 micrograms Pt/mg tissue). IA infusions of 24 hours or less resulted in significantly lower Pt levels. Maximum tumor Pt concentration after IV administration was only 0.98 micrograms/mg tissue (48-hour infusion). Muscle Pt levels adjacent to the tumor were highest in the IA infused extremities, but at the 48-hour interval, were 53-fold less than tumor levels. Tumor and adjacent muscle Pt levels were not significantly different from each other after IV administration. This study provides pharmacologic evidence that lengthening the duration of IA DDP infusion increases tumor levels of Pt over that of IV or rapid IA administrations. The benefit of prolonged IA DDP infusions is dependent upon both route and schedule of drug administration.\r"

The odds of breast cancer increased steadily with increasing breast density (test for trend, P less than 0.0001). Breast cancer odds was 1.7 for densities between 5% and 24.9%, 2.5 for 25% through 44.9%, 3.8 for 45% through 64%, and 4.3 for densities of 65% and greater (referent = less than 5% densities). Odds ratios also increased with increasing densities among women with the P2 and DY mammographic patterns. These findings suggest that the percentage of mammographic densities in the breast can predict breast cancer risk more accurately than a qualitative assessment of mammographic patterns.\r"

Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is advantageous to conservative management, as illustrated by the current cases of two children with recurrent Wilms' tumors in their remaining kidneys. Both children underwent limited surgery and precisely directed IORT. In one patient the nephron-sparing surgery and IORT were performed in situ. In the other the kidney was removed, treated with ex vivo bench surgery and radiation surgery, and then reimplanted. The adjuvant use of IORT, either in situ or ex vivo, in nephron-sparing surgery permits complete obliteration of gross and microscopic disease while maximizing residual renal function.\r"

Eight patients with HGA who underwent incomplete resection responded to chemotherapy alone. Four additional patients had complete resection of the tumor. Median survival time of the group (responders and nonresponders) has been 14 months. Twelve patients with MBT responded to chemotherapy alone (six had complete response [CR], and six had partial response [PR]) with a median survival time of 7 months.

Patients were evenly matched for pretreatment characteristics with the exception that white patients had a significantly higher percentage of bone metastases and significantly less skin involvement. Response rates and median time to progression were similar for black patients and white patients at 31% and 25%, and 9.3 and 9.1 months, respectively. Black patients had poorer survival times even when adjusting for covariables; median survival time was 14.3 months for black patients and 20.3 months for white patients (P less than 0.05).

Maximum tolerated doses (MTD) were determined for preoperative combined LV/5-FU and RT and for postoperative sequential LV/5-FU. 5-FU was escalated 50 mg/m2 while the LV remained constant at 200 mg/m2. The initial doses of 5-FU were combined LV/5-FU and RT (200 mg/m2) and sequential LV/5-FU (325 mg/m2). The median follow-up time was 14 months. The resectability rate was 89%, and the pathologic complete response rate was 21%. The MTD for combined LV/5-FU and RT was 300 mg/m2; therefore, the recommended dose of 5-FU is 250 mg/m2. The recommended dose of 5-FU for sequential LV/5-FU is 375 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxicities in this trial were diarrhea, tenesmus, increased bowel movements, dysuria, and myelosuppression. For the six patients who received 5-FU at the recommended dose level, the median low counts were leukocyte count, 3.7/microliters (range, 2.4 to 4.9/microliters); hemoglobin, 9.0 g/dl (range, 8.2 to 11.9 g/dl); and platelet count (X1000), 146/microliters (range, 89 to 182/microliters). The incidence rate of any Grade 3 toxicity was 17% (diarrhea and frequent bowel movements). The recommended doses of 5-FU used in this protocol were well tolerated. Because there was a long delay before optimal doses of 5-FU could be delivered, the authors do not recommend that high-dose LV be used in conjunction with combined 5-FU and RT with the treatment regimen as currently designed. However, because the resectability and complete response rates were higher than those previously reported for preoperative RT alone, the authors are encouraged by the combined technique approach. New trials are currently being undertaken to determine if the use of a low-dose LV regimen is more tolerable.\r"

Eleven previously untreated patients with Stages III and IV ovarian carcinoma were treated concomitantly with 2000 cGy of WAR and intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin followed by additional IP cisplatin after debulking surgery. Toxicity was moderate to severe. Sixty-four percent of patients had Grades 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity, and 36% required hospitalization for sepsis during WAR/IP cisplatin. Hematologic toxicity was less pronounced during IP cisplatin alone. All patients experienced moderate gastrointestinal toxicity. The average percentage of total body weight lost was 13.5%. Fifty-five percent of all patients demonstrated a complete clinical response to therapy, and patients with minimal postoperative residual disease fared better. One patient with persistent disease had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) 24 months after initial diagnosis. No patients with residual disease greater than 20 mm survived, while 50% of patients with less than 20 mm are clinically free of disease. Toxicity appears to be additive with the combination of WAR and IP cisplatin. Therapeutic efficacy was comparable with standard chemotherapy regimens, but no therapeutic or survival advantages were demonstrated with the use of this treatment protocol.\r"

Seventeen patients had intravaginal brachytherapy after whole-pelvis RT. Local recurrence developed in two patients (2.3%) (one in Group 1 and one in Group 2). Statistical analysis showed that the depth of myometrial invasion significantly influenced survival (P = 0.016). Tumor grade, pathologic stage, whole-pelvis radiation dose, and the use of brachytherapy did not influence survival. Complications occurred in 9.5% of patients in Group 1, 24.7% in Group 2, and 40.5% in Group 3. Three patients who received brachytherapy had rectal injuries. The authors conclude that 4250 cGy in 25 fractions for 5 weeks of whole-pelvis RT appears to induce fewer complications than higher doses, and may be sufficient to prevent local recurrence in most patients who require adjuvant RT. A clinical trial is needed to determine the optimum dose-time-fractionation regimen.\r"

The study was conducted using monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) directed against different epitopes of the tumor-associated glycoprotein, TAG-72 (CC-49, CC-83, B72.3), of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (COL-4, COL-12), and of the colon-associated antigen, CAA (anti-CAA). The authors detected immunohistochemical reactions of MoAb CC-49 and anti-CAA with antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as peritumoral and sinus macrophages and lymphatic endothelial cells and with specific areas of germinal centers in lymph nodes draining 11 of 24 colorectal carcinomas studied. The corresponding primary tumors expressed the TAG-72 and CAA antigens. No immunostaining was detectable in lymph nodes using the anti-CEA MoAb, even when the primary tumors strongly expressed the specific epitopes. In germinal centers of regional lymph nodes, the immunostaining was often distributed at the periphery with a characteristic crescentic or circular pattern, which strongly suggested the exposure of the specific epitopes defined by MoAb CC-49 and anti-CAA on follicular dendritic cells. This would indicate that these epitopes are selectively recognized and presented to germinal center B-cells. This phenomenon may have clinical and diagnostic implications.\r"

  ".U": "91223477\r", 
  ".W": "The authors reviewed retrospectively the results of molecular genetic analysis of 175 hematolymphoid lesions to assess the diagnostic utility of genotyping (analysis for immunoglobulin or beta-chain T-cell receptor gene rearrangements). All cases had been genotyped, and most were also immunophenotyped. Cases were assigned to control (90 cases) or problem groups (85 cases), depending on the absence or presence respectively of diagnostic uncertainty remaining after conventional (morphologic and immunophenotypic) analysis. All control cases had unequivocal morphologic features of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and had appropriate lineage-specific gene rearrangements, but immunostaining was almost as sensitive in demonstrating phenotypes that were diagnostically abnormal as well as lineage-specifying. However, genotyping was clearly diagnostically useful in the problem cases, which included a heterogeneous mixture of nodal and extranodal biopsy specimens of malignant (mostly NHL) and benign lesions. Genotyping demonstrated the appropriate absence or presence of gene rearrangements in 58 of 81 problem cases (72%) ultimately diagnosed as benign or malignant respectively, excluding four cases of Hodgkin's disease; in 25 cases (31%) this was judged to be essential to diagnosis. In the remaining problem cases genotyping did not contribute positively to diagnosis, but in no case was genotyping misleading when cautiously interpreted with primary reliance on conventional analysis and with knowledge of known causes of potentially misleading results, both positive and negative. It is concluded that although genotyping is highly sensitive and specific for hematolymphoid neoplasia, it provides little or no benefit in cases that are unequivocally malignant by conventional analysis, in cases of suspected Hodgkin's disease (HD), or for the sole purpose of lineage assignment. However, in cases whose diagnosis is uncertain after conventional analysis, the high yield of useful information from genotyping with careful interpretation warrants its application.\r"

  ".W": "Cachexia is a phenomenon commonly observed in patients with cancer, but its etiology is poorly understood. Abnormalities of insulin action and metabolism that have been hypothesized to promote cancer cachexia were investigated in this study using a computerized euglycemic clamp and modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) in a group of malnourished patients with localized head and neck cancer, and in healthy, well-nourished, age- and, sex-matched controls. Glucose disposal rates, determined by the euglycemic clamp at three different rates of insulin infusion did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, mean plasma insulin concentrations at each level of insulin infused were significantly lower in the patients with cancer than in the control subjects resulting in unexpectedly higher calculated insulin metabolic clearance rate in the patients with cancer. Peripheral insulin sensitivity calculated from the slope of glucose disposal versus plasma insulin concentration did not differ between the two groups. Results from the FSIGT demonstrated no difference in insulin sensitivity or insulin-independent glucose disappearance between the two groups. However, whole body glucose appearance was significantly elevated in the patients with cancer. Thus, increased whole body glucose utilization in the absence of insulin resistance or increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal was observed. These data are consistent with the concept of a localized tumor acting as a glucose drain in which case increased glucose appearance and increased insulin clearance would defend against hypoglycemia.\r"

The tumor recurred 10 and 22 months after initial resection. The histologic condition of the first recurrence was similar to the original tumor except for some increased nuclear irregularities and mitotic activity. No adjunctive therapy was administered initially or after the first recurrence. The second recurrence showed mixed embryonal/alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. This case represented a unique model of a highly differentiated striated muscle tumor converting to a moderately differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma, and illustrated differential diagnostic difficulties in distinguishing between fetal cellular rhabdomyoma and differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient was compared with eight children and adolescents with primary sarcomas of the tongue who entered the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Studies (IRS) I, II, and III protocols. The tumors of all eight arose at the base of the tongue. There were five embryonal, one alveolar, and one mixed embryonal/alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, and one undifferentiated myxoid sarcoma. Five rhabdomyosarcomas were poorly differentiated, and two had a moderate degree of myogenesis. These sarcomas of the tongue represent approximately 0.34% of all cases entered in IRS studies.\r"

There were 23 (12.2%) carcinomas with evidence of c-erbB-2 protein in which the reaction was localized to the cell membrane. There was no significant association between c-erbB-2 staining and the macroscopic or histologic type of the carcinomas. c-erbB-2-stained tumors were more likely to be associated with serosal invasion, nodal involvement, and peritoneal metastasis, than c-erbB-2-unstained ones. In addition, c-erbB-2 was stained in none of early gastric carcinomas. The 5-year survival rates of the c-erbB-2 protein-positive and the protein-negative group were 11% and 50%, respectively. When the c-erbB-2 tissue status and seven clinicopathologic variables as conventional prognostic factors were entered simultaneously into the Cox regression model, serosal invasion, hepatic metastasis, peritoneal metastasis, nodal status, and c-erbB-2 tissue status emerged as independent prognostic variables. The results suggested that c-erbB-2 protein expression might be enhanced in advanced stages during the progression of gastric carcinoma. In this particular group of patients, immunoreactivity for c-erbB-2 protein is an indicator of poor short-term prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphorous 31 (31P) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded from perchloric acid extracts of benign and malignant breast tumors. The spectra were correlated with the histopathologic diagnosis and the steroid receptor status of the tumor. Higher relative content of the lipid-derived metabolite glycerolphosphoethanolamine (GPE), the high-energy nucleoside phosphates (nucleoside-diphosphate [NDP], nucleoside-triphosphate [NTP]), and sugar esters of uridine diphosphate (UDPS) appeared in the carcinomas. Malignant tumors also showed a lower ratio of phosphoethanolamine to phosphocholine (PE/PC) than benign conditions. Lower content of the lipid-derived metabolite glycerolphosphocholine (GPC) and high content of the high-energy compound phosphocreatine (PCr) were associated with malignant tumors having high content of estrogen receptors (ER). High PCr content was also associated in the carcinomas with high progesterone receptors (PgR) content. In the benign tumors NDP and NTP were higher in tumors with high PgR content. The authors suggest that 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the breast can provide additional variables to diagnose malignancy, and when combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), invasive procedures may be avoided. It also seems that levels of PCr and GPC obtained from the spectra can serve as markers to hormonal receptor status of breast carcinomas, and may be used in addition to the ER and PgR content to improve prediction of the response to hormonal therapy. Additional development requires in situ MRI and MRS combined studies.\r"

No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events.\r"

The histologic type of the primary tumor was obtained in 32 cases as a result of thoracic investigations and in five cases from metastatic tumor tissue. The primary tumor appeared to be non-small cell lung carcinoma in 26 cases and small cell lung carcinoma in 11 cases. These results show that patients treated with surgery (20 cases) have a better survival (median 10 months versus 4.5) than the others, and among surgically treated patients only those treated with bifocal resection (eight patients) are long-term survivors. Also, in four of six patients, objective regression of the neurologic symptoms was seen after radiation therapy alone. Central nervous system relapse was seen in 12 patients, but in none of the patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy. Conventional chemotherapy (11 patients) induced objective responses only in the small cell type and proved to be too toxic when used simultaneously with radiation therapy in inoperable patients.\r"

To define the abnormal, a complete delineation of normal is first required; this has been disregarded for most diagnostic criteria of this disorder. Once normal is defined, a link between the abnormal state and subfertility is required to demonstrate clinical relevance; this has yet to be shown with any form of LPI criteria. Despite this, some pieces of the puzzle are apparent. In the form of a short luteal phase LPI is present in roughly 5% of ovulatory cycles. The rate also tends to increase at the extremes of reproductive age. The rate of hormonal- or biopsy-diagnosed LPI appears to be in approximately the same range, although the criteria for diagnosis are much more poorly defined, and the rate of \"abnormal\" is often built into the definition. Finally, ongoing development of more precise and accurate tools for diagnosis promises to produce more and better data in the future to furnish the clinician with greater insight into the rate and overall importance of LPI as a cause of infertility.\r"

  ".U": "91223712\r", 
  ".W": "Myasthenia gravis is a complex autoimmune disorder. Anti-AChR antibodies destroy elements of the postsynaptic membrane of the myoneural junction in affected muscle groups. This results in decreased nerve-impulse transmission. Myasthenic patients have diminished skeletal muscle strength and tire rapidly with exercise. Pregnancy threatens maternal myasthenic exacerbation and crisis, particularly early in the puerperium. The medication requires frequent adjustment during pregnancy due to changing requirements and physiologic changes in absorption and excretion. Myasthenia results in an increase in maternal mortality, morbidity, pregnancy wastage, and premature labor. Anticholinesterase medications and corticosteroids are the mainstays of medical therapy of maternal MG. Thymectomy, plasmapheresis, immunosuppressant drugs, gamma globulin, and ACTH are adjuvants of varying usefulness. Enforced rest periods, a tranquil environment, and prompt treatment of intercurrent infections are important for myasthenic mothers. The management of myasthenic crisis requires hospital intensive care with mechanical respiratory support and careful monitoring of blood gases. Plasmapheresis is an effective means of controlling crises. It is usually combined with intensive steroid and or immunosuppressant therapy. The myasthenic mother undertakes pregnancy with increased risk to herself and her infant. There is a 40% chance of exacerbation of her MG during pregnancy and an additional 30% risk in the puerperium. Maternal mortality risk is approximately 40 per 1,000 live births. Perinatal mortality approximates 68 per 1,000 births, five times that of uncomplicated pregnancies. Modern management minimizes these risks to the extent that pregnancy is not precluded in myasthenic women. A good outcome depends on meticulous maternal and fetal prenatal surveillance and early detection and management of exacerbations. Facilities and trained personnel must be available to support labor and manage vaginal or operative delivery. Intensive care of myasthenic crises is critical to the prevention of maternal complications and death.\r"

The manufacturers' instructions were followed for all the reagents, calibrators and controls provided with each analyzer used. Precision, stability, dynamic range, interferences, and comparison of analyses of 50-100 patient samples with standard laboratory instruments were evaluated. Within-run precision on all three instruments was acceptable, the coefficient of variation (% CV) ranging from 0.8-5.4% and run-to-run precision CV of 1.1-7.3%. Within-run precision for glucose, blood urea, nitrogen, cholesterol and sodium for an experienced technologist, a clerk without any laboratory experience and a physician with no recent laboratory training were compared: the total CV varied between 1.1 and 6.3%. There are differences in the way bilirubin and hemoglobin interfere with the chemistries on the analyzers. Instrument size, available analyses, reagent cost and ease of operation were also assessed. The data suggest that all three analyzers performed well and would be suitable for the pediatric office setting.\r"

Side-effects with acute D dosing are transitory with no demonstrated evidence of permanent deleterious action. The threshold of D toxicity has been defined in animals and is far in excess of concentrations conceivably used in human studies. The possibility that D may have additional beneficial pharmacological applications cannot be excluded. For isotopes other than D, evidence of observed toxicity remains to be produced even at dosages far in excess of the range used in metabolic studies. Absence of adverse effect may be attributable to small mass differences and the similar properties of tracer and predominantly abundant isotope. Absolute determination of stable isotope toxicity in humans is rendered impossible by ethical considerations. Also, the precision of extrapolating toxicity thresholds from animal studies remains unknown. However, should perturbation of the delicate homoeostatic characteristic of living organisms occur with use of stable isotopes, it is almost undoubtedly at some level of administration greatly in excess of those administered currently in biomedical research.\r"

  ".W": "1. Studies of Helicobacter pylori show that microbes can alter gastrin release. Lack of gastric acid (achlorhydria) causes hypergastrinaemia and allows bacteria to grow within the stomach. We speculated that the bacteria contribute to the rise in gastrin seen after acid inhibition, and tested the idea by comparing plasma gastrin levels during inhibition of acid secretion between germ-free and conventional rats. 2. Matched germ-free and conventional rats (n = 8 per group) received either vehicle (saline) or one of two doses of the histamine-H2-receptor antagonist loxtidine for 1 week. Gastrin was measured in cardiac blood by a specific r.i.a. 3. Plasma gastrin concentrations in germ-free and conventional rats were 59 +/- 11 pmol/l (mean +/- SEM) and 36 +/- 8 pmol/l, respectively, after vehicle, and 153 +/- 30 pmol/l and 181 +/- 27 pmol/l, respectively, after loxtidine at a dose of 10 mg day -1 kg -1, which partially inhibits acid secretion. Administration of loxtidine at a dose of 70 mg day -1 kg-1, which completely inhibits acid secretion, did not produce a significant extra rise in plasma gastrin concentration in germ-free rats (178 +/- 11 pmol/l), but further elevated plasma gastrin concentrations to 278 +/- 26 pmol/l in conventional rats (P less than 0.005 compared with germ-free rats). 4. Loxtidine produced a dose-dependent rise in the number of eosinophils in the gastric mucosa of conventional rats. 5. We conclude that partial inhibition of gastric acid secretion increases gastrin release independently of bacteria, but that bacteria are involved in the further rise in gastrin which occurs on more profound inhibition of gastric acid secretion.\r"

A study was made of the activity of the enzyme thyroid peroxidase and of the concentration, carbohydrate composition and the degree of iodination of thyroglobulin in the thyroid glands of 60 patients with non-endemic non-toxic goitre in the nodular phase and in those of 25 control subjects. 2. Thyroid peroxidase activity was determined by the guaiacol assay and was significantly higher in patients with non-endemic non-toxic goitre than in control subjects (3.60 +/- 2.51 and 2.07 +/- 1.08 mumol of guaiacol oxidized min-1 g-1 of tissue, respectively; ranges 0.16-10.57 and 0.52-4.85 mumol of guaiacol oxidized min-1 g-1 of tissue, respectively; P less than 0.05). 3. Thyroglobulin was purified by precipitation with ammonium sulphate and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. Two protein peaks were obtained which were identified as thyroglobulin and measured by radioimmunoassay. The concentration of thyroglobulin in the first peak was 98.94 (SD 84.87, range 0.60-455.54) mg/g of tissue for the patients with non-endemic, non-toxic goitre and 51.41 (SD 28.34, range 14.99-106.39) mg/g of tissue for the control subjects (P less than 0.01). The second peak showed 1.26 (SD 1.27, range 0.09-6.50) mg of thyroglobulin/mg of tissue for the group with non-endemic non-toxic goitre and 0.51 (SD 0.25, range 0.15-0.98 mg of thyroglobulin/mg of tissue) for the control subjects (P less than 0.01). 4.

The specific activity of triacylglycerol labelling attained by incubating intact erythrocytes with [3H]oleic acid was 10 nmol/mumol, a value 20-fold higher than that of the highest labelled phospholipid, sphingomyelin; as isolated by ultracentrifugation over a density gradient, the youngest erythrocytes exhibited a labelling rate 10-fold higher than that of older cells. 3. The triacylglycerol content was not modified in erythrocytes from chronic alcoholics, whereas the mean rate of triacylglycerol labelling was 31% (P less than 0.05) higher than that of control subjects, and did not normalize 4 weeks after alcohol withdrawal. 4. These results indicate that triacylglycerol, although a quantitatively minor component, is one of the most active metabolites in the lipid matrix of the human erythrocyte membrane and appears to be implicated in the membrane response to antagonistic agents.\r"

Changes in spinal trabecular bone mineral density and radial shaft bone mineral content were also assessed by using quantitative computed tomography and single photon absorptiometry, respectively. 2. The mean annual decreases (95% confidence intervals) were: total body calcium, 7.8% (-12.0 to -3.7%; P less than 0.001); spinal trabecular bone mineral density, 2.5% (-5.0 to +0.1%; 0.05 less than P less than 0.1), radial bone mineral content, 2.1% (-3.4 to -0.8%; P less than 0.01). 3. No significant correlations were found between rates of change of the three variables. However, there were significant positive correlations between the baseline values for total body calcium and radial bone mineral content (r = 0.638, P less than 0.05), spinal bone mineral density and radial bone mineral content (r = 0.854, P less than 0.01), and total body calcium and spinal bone mineral density (r = 0.876, P less than 0.001). 4. These results demonstrate rapid decreases in total body calcium in patients with inflammatory bowel disease which, in conjunction with the significant decrease in radial shaft bone mineral content, indicate increased rates of cortical bone loss. Whilst values for bone mass at different skeletal sites showed positive correlations within individuals, no relationship was found between the rates of change in bone mass at these sites. 5. The rapid bone loss observed in some subjects emphasizes the importance of early detection of osteoporosis by bone densitometry and the need for effective prophylactic measures to be established in this group of patients.\r"

Baseline blood pressure, heart rate and forearm blood flow did not differ between the two groups. 3.

The alpha 2-adrenoceptor density/beta 2-adrenoceptor density ratio in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon was, with a value of 0.37 +/- 0.04, higher than in the control subjects, where a value of 0.25 +/- 0.02 was measured (P less than 0.001). Plasma adrenaline concentration, beta 2-adrenoceptor density and the antagonist affinity to both receptor subtypes did not differ between both groups under baseline conditions. 5. Whereas during the finger-cooling test no differences were seen in the responses of the parameters measured, the mental arithmetic test induced an increase in laser Doppler flux in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and a decrease in the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "1. A fall in intraocular pressure is induced by acute hypoglycaemia in humans. The role of the autonomic nervous system in mediating this response was investigated in 24 normal volunteers in whom hypoglycaemia was induced with intravenous soluble insulin, under four experimental conditions: (1) control (n = 6), (2) non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (phentolamine) (n = 6), (3) non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol) (n = 6) and (4) cholinergic blockade (atropine) (n = 6). Intraocular pressure was measured by using an applanation tonometer. In 12 subjects intraocular pressure was measured during each type of pharmacological blockade of similar duration without induction of hypoglycaemia, to assess the effects of individual antagonists. 2. In the control study intraocular pressure fell during hypoglycaemia from 15 +/- 1.0 to 10 +/- 1.3 mmHg (P less than 0.01) 10 min after the autonomic reaction. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade caused a reduction in intraocular pressure from 15 +/- 1.1 to 9 +/- 1.0 mmHg (P less than 0.001) before the administration of insulin, and when hypoglycaemia was induced intraocular pressure decreased further to 7 +/- 1.0 mmHg (P less than 0.05, compared with immediately before insulin). A decrease in intraocular pressure of similar magnitude was observed with propranolol alone (16 +/- 1.0 to 10 +/- 1.0 mmHg, P less than 0.05). 3. Cholinergic blockade had no immediate effect on intraocular pressure, and the reduction in intraocular pressure during hypoglycaemia was of similar magnitude to that observed during the control study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

While marked changes were observed in kidney renin mRNA levels in all three experimental groups compared with their respective controls, in most of the extra-renal tissue studied minimal, if any, difference was seen in renin mRNA levels between the hypertensive and control rats. 3. The findings suggest that in these extra-renal tissues renin gene expression is differently regulated from that in the kidney, and particularly that it is not profoundly affected by changes in the level of circulating angiotensin II. 4. An increase in renin mRNA was observed in the adrenal glands of the 'chronic' Goldblatt rats, which may be of relevance to the maintenance of hypertension in this model.\r"

  ".W": "1. The aims of this study were twofold: (i) to investigate the ability of a recently described [2H5]phenylalanine method for quantifying whole-body protein turnover during acute physiological perturbation; (ii) to determine specifically whether the previously observed increase in protein synthesis on insulin withdrawal in insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetic patients seen when employing the [13C]leucine technique could be corroborated by using [2H5]phenylalanine. 2. Whole-body protein turnover was measured by both the [2H5]phenylalanine and [13C]leucine primed continuous infusion methods applied simultaneously to six type I post-absorptive diabetic patients during insulin withdrawal and infusion. 3. Values were determined by the [13C]leucine method by measuring either [13C]leucine (primary pool) or alpha-[13C] ketoisocaproic acid (reciprocal pool) enrichment in plasma. 4. Values of whole-body protein breakdown during insulin withdrawal derived from the [2H5]phenylalanine and primary and reciprocal pool [13C]leucine models respectively were 3.54 +/- 0.43, 3.85 +/- 0.41 and 4.62 +/- 0.44 g day-1 kg-1 (means +/- SD). Insulin infusion resulted in a significant reduction (P less than 0.02) to 3.07 +/- 0.34, 3.05 +/- 0.26 and 3.82 +/- 0.4 g day-1 kg-1, respectively. Synthesis values fell significantly but by a smaller amount than breakdown, resulting in increased (P less than 0.05) net protein deposition, regardless of the model used. 5. These data demonstrate that the [2H5]phenylalanine and [13C]leucine methods generate similar results both in absolute and relative terms in response to short-term insulin infusion. 6. The confirmation of increased whole-body protein synthesis during insulin withdrawal by two independent methods supports the validity of this observation.\r"

We assessed lung density, determined by computerized tomography, as a measure of emphysema and related this to lung function and measurement of the elastic recoil of the lung in normal subjects and patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. 2. We found a significant correlation between measurements of elastic recoil pressure at 90% of total lung capacity and both the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001) and the transfer factor for carbon monoxide (r = 0.70, P less than 0.001). Measurements of elastic recoil of the lung also correlated with lung density as measured by computerized tomography scanning (P less than 0.001). 3. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a correlation between the density of the lowest fifth percentile of the computerized tomography lung-density histogram, and both the natural logarithm of the shape parameter of the pressure-volume curve (P less than 0.01), and the transfer factor for carbon monoxide (P less than 0.01). However, the mean computerized tomography lung density correlated, in addition, with the elastic recoil pressure of the lungs at 90% of total lung capacity (P less than 0.001). 4. Since the elastic recoil pressure correlates with computerized tomography lung density, and hence with emphysema, and since elastic recoil pressure also correlates with the forced expiratory volume in 1 s, these results suggest that loss of elastic recoil is one determinant of airflow limitation in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.\r"

In eight clinically stable symptomatic human-immunodeficiency-virus-infected patients and in seven healthy control subjects, glucose and fat metabolism were studied, using indirect calorimetry and primed continuous infusions of [3-3H]glucose and [14C]palmitate. 2. Studies were performed in the post-absorptive state (16 h of overnight fasting) and again after 22 h of overnight fasting. 3. In the post-absorptive state, net fat oxidation and triacylglycerol ('triglyceride') concentrations were significantly higher in the patients, but concentrations and turnover of free fatty acids were not significantly different between patients and control subjects. After 22 h of overnight fasting, free fatty acid turnover in the patients rose to significantly higher levels when compared with the control subjects. 4. Post-absorptive glucose oxidation, glucose turnover and glucose clearance did not differ between patients and control subjects. Although fasting induced a significantly greater decline in glucose turnover in the patients, plasma glucose concentrations decreased comparably in patients and control subjects. 5. No differences were found in plasma concentrations of insulin or of the counter-regulatory hormones between patients and control subjects. 6. It is concluded that the metabolic adaptation to short-term starvation in clinically stable human-immuno-deficiency-virus-infected patients differs from that in healthy control subjects. Short-term starvation results in a significantly greater fall in glucose turnover, whereas fat metabolism is clearly stimulated. These alterations cannot be explained by differences in the concentrations of insulin or of the counter-regulatory hormones.\r"

Isolated extensor digitorum longus muscles from control C57BL/10 and mutant dystrophin-deficient C57BL/10 mdx mice have been studied in vitro to determine whether dystrophin deficiency influences the susceptibility of muscle to contractile activity-induced damage. 2. mdx muscles were found to release reduced amounts of intracellular creatine kinase compared with control tissue in response to excessive contractile activity with or without simultaneous stretching of the muscle to 130% of its resting length. 3. In contrast, prostaglandin E2 release from mdx muscle was elevated compared with control tissue in response to either form of contractile activity or to treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. 4. These results do not support the hypothesis that dystrophin-deficient muscle is more susceptible to damage induced by contractile activity, but suggest that dystrophin deficiency influences the activity of muscle membrane phospholipase enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "1. Three oral glucose tolerance tests were performed in each of 32 symptomatic postprandial hypoglycaemic patients (before placebo, before doxepin therapy and after doxepin therapy). Plasma neurotransmitters were determined in parallel with assays of plasma insulin and glucose levels. 2. Three different types of patients were distinguished. Type I showed a low noradrenaline/adrenaline ratio, high dopamine levels and low platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) levels during basal periods. After a glucose load, late peaks of dopamine and free 5-hydroxytryptamine, which coincided with the symptoms but not with the nadir of plasma glucose, were observed. Type II showed a low basal plasma noradrenaline/adrenaline ratio. After a glucose load, progressive increases in adrenaline and decreases in glucose were seen. Adrenergic symptoms coincided with the nadir of glucose. Although type III patients showed hyperinsulinaemia after a glucose load similar to the other types of patient, they did not show hyperglycaemia, but rather exhibited a sustained and progressive reduction in plasma glucose. These patients were characterized by a high basal plasma noradrenaline/adrenaline ratio, high basal plasma levels of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethyleneglycol and high basal levels of platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine, all of which increased after a glucose load. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreases paralleled reductions in heart rate and glucose. The nadir of plasma glucose occurred simultaneously with the appearance of symptoms (weakness, heartburn, oppressive chest pain, tension headache, abdominal cramps, dizziness, etc.). Therapy with doxepin led to disappearance of the symptoms within 3-4 weeks. Normalization of all other disordered variables (cardiovascular, metabolic and neurochemical, and the clonidine test) paralleled the disappearance of the symptoms. 3. Symptoms varied in the three types of patients and we conclude that they are related to hypoglycaemia-induced disorders of plasma neurotransmitters, rather than to hypoglycaemia per se. We postulate that an uncoping stress situation (type I and II patients) and depression (type III patients) underlie the physiopathological mechanisms.\r"

The effect of free-radical-altered IgG (monomer and polymer u.v.-irradiated IgG), compared with that of native and heat-aggregated IgG, on the production rate of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by granulocytes (polymorphonuclear leucocytes) from normal blood and granulocytes obtained from the blood and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis was studied. 2. Similar rates of superoxide production by granulocytes from normal blood at rest and in the presence of any form of IgG were found. In contrast, the rate of hydrogen peroxide production could be stimulated in a dose-dependent fashion by monomer or polymer u.v.-irradiated IgG. 3. The stimulatory effect of free-radical-altered IgG on the rate of hydrogen peroxide production did not occur in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose, which deprives the NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase of its substrate NADPH by inhibition of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. This points to a stimulatory effect on the direct divalent reduction of oxygen without intermediate superoxide production by this enzyme complex. 4. Granulocytes obtained from the blood and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis reacted differently to polymer u.v.-irradiated IgG. In the presence of this stimulus the rate of release of both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide was increased. Furthermore, these granulocytes synthesized superoxide and hydrogen peroxide at a higher rate than did granulocytes from normal blood in the presence of serum-treated zymosan but not in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate. 5. Taken together, these results indicate that the rate of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by the granulocyte NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase depends on the pathological condition of the donor and the type of stimulus used.\r"

Male Wistar rats were fed a liquid diet containing 35% of total energy as ethanol or isovolumetric, isocaloric and isonitrogenous amounts of the same diet in which ethanol was substituted by isocaloric glucose (controls). 2. At 6 weeks the entire skeletal muscle mass was reduced by approximately 20%. The urinary excretion of nitrogen, urea and uric acid increased by between 23 and 128%. Urinary creatinine excretion was not significantly altered. 3. Urinary excretion of magnesium was significantly increased by 43%. Urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate was increased slightly (i.e. 5-22%), but this change was not statistically significant. 4. Proton n.m.r. spectroscopic analysis showed that ethanol feeding reduced the urinary excretion of citrate and 2-oxoglutarate (by approximately 50%), suggesting decreased citric acid cycle activity. There was an increased excretion of alanine (44%), but excretion of succinate and acetate was not significantly altered. Ethanol in the urine of ethanol-fed rats comprised approximately 2% of total ethanol intake and less than 1% of total energy intake. 5. Lactose was detectable in urine of ethanol-fed rats, but not in control rats, reflecting the reported decreased intestinal lactase activity and increased gut permeability in alcoholics. Urinary galactose excretion decreased by 41%, but relatively large increases in lactate excretion (50%) did not achieve statistical significance. 6. It was concluded that chronic ethanol feeding causes disturbances in whole-body nitrogen homoeostasis and alterations in intermediary metabolism.\r"

Its presence in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and/or sepsis has been associated with particularly high mortality rates that may be the result of tissue hypoxia that causes multiple organ failure. The evidence for this association has been indirect because we cannot use invasive methods that would be necessary to verify or disprove the hypothesis. Because further progress will depend on the development of adequate animal models of pathologic oxygen supply dependency, we have attempted to evaluate some of the available information in this area as well as the likelihood that tissue hypoxia will prove to be the precipitating factor. In anesthetized dogs injected or infused with endotoxin, many of the features of pathologic oxygen supply dependency have been successfully produced. These features include defective peripheral oxygen extraction, increased oxygen demand, and increased lactate levels. Regional measurements have shown that gut Vo2 decreases before other areas, particularly skeletal muscle. Lactate measurements alone were shown not to be sufficient proof of tissue hypoxia. More direct measurements of actual energy states and tissue Po2 are indicated for future research efforts.\r"

Although multiple immunologic abnormalities have been identified following injury, blood loss, and tissue ischemia, the mechanisms that produce these alterations in T- and B-cell function have not been completely defined. Physiologic stress and ischemia result in increased release of neuroendocrine peptides and hormones, capable of affecting normal neuroendocrine-immunologic balance and producing immunosuppression. Tissue ischemia leads to increased expression of heat shock proteins by hypoperfused cells, which can alter T-cell function. Injury also is followed by the appearance of serum immunosuppressive factors, which have been shown to inhibit T- and B-cell function. Future therapies directed at these and other cellular and molecular abnormalities initiated by tissue hypoperfusion may reverse the immunosuppressed state in critically ill patients and lead to improved outcome in this setting.\r"

In cellular terms, hypoxia is characterized by decreases in the intracellular concentration of oxygen, leading to a decline in aerobically produced adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The deficit arising from unequal levels of cellular ATP requirements and aerobic ATP production is partially satisfied by anaerobic sources of ATP, including glycolysis, the creatine kinase reaction, and the adenylate kinase reaction. These reactions can set in motion cellular mechanisms that ultimately may lead to cellular dysfunction and death. A clear understanding of the relative importance of these reactions is impossible to acquire from global measures of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption; therefore, the clinical monitoring of tissue oxygenation also should include the measurement of metabolically relevant, organ-specific variables.\r"

Two methods commonly used to assess the integrity of the GI mucosal barrier are assessment of the extent of microbial translocation and measurement of mucosal permeability to hydrophilic probes. RESULTS: Studies using these methods have provided convincing evidence that the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa is deranged in numerous animal models of shock, trauma, and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the mechanisms underlying mucosal injury under these circumstances remain incompletely understood, current evidence suggests that mucosal damage in shock, trauma, and sepsis is likely due to various combinations of intracellular hypoxia due to ischemia, tissue injury caused by reactive oxygen metabolites, the deleterious effects of various lipid mediators (e.g., platelet-activating factor) and/or cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor), and deficient utilization or supply of key nutritional substrates (e.g., glutamine).\r"

DESIGN: Descriptive study of oxygen transport interrelationships throughout critical illness in a consecutive series of surviving and nonsurviving patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SETTING: University-affiliated city hospital. PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 55 critically ill patients with ARDS after shock of various etiologies. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Noninvasive VO2 was measured by a continuous, on-line, real-time device developed in our department. Inspired and expired oxygen concentrations were measured using a polarographic oxygen analyzer. Minute ventilation measurements were time integrated over 7-min intervals. Cardiac index, DO2, and VO2 were simultaneously measured invasively by pulmonary artery thermodilution catheters, together with arterial and mixed venous blood gases. There was good agreement (r2 = .60) in VO2 measured by the invasive and noninvasive methods. The estimated oxygen deficit or excess was calculated as the difference between the actual measured VO2 standardized for body temperature pressure saturated and the normative standard VO2 of each patient corrected for temperature and sedation (VO2 need). A total of 317 monitoring days in 55 patients were analyzed; 25 survivors were monitored for a mean of 4.6 +/- 2.9 days and 30 nonsurvivors were monitored for 6.9 +/- 6.6 days. Survivors had significantly higher cardiac index, DO2, and VO2 values. Generally, oxygen excesses were found in the survivors and oxygen deficit was observed in the nonsurvivors. Survivors did not reach a plateau in their DO2-VO2 patterns. In the septic nonsurviving patients and both nonseptic groups by contrast, a plateau was observed in the DO2-VO2 pattern. Surviving septic patients had a critical DO2 of 16 mL/min.kg (700 mL/min.m2) and a critical VO2 of 3.5 mL/min.kg (145 mL/min.m2). CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of VO2 and DO2 variables is useful for evaluation of tissue oxygenation and titration of therapy in critically ill patients. Noninvasive monitoring of VO2 values are in good agreement with VO2 values calculated from invasive measurements of cardiac index. The increased DO2 and VO2 values are not attributable to mathematical coupling of erroneous cardiac index values.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence that oxygen consumption (VO2) is pathologically dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2). DATA SOURCES: Studies published since 1972 with their relevant bibliographies and computerized search of MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: All clinical papers reporting the relationship of: VO2 to DO2 in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, other critically ill patients, and normal individuals; cardiac output determined by measured VO2 to calculated VO2 from the arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference; blood lactate to DO2; and selected basic science studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality was assessed and all pertinent data were summarized. RESULTS OF DATA EXTRACTION: Normal individuals display physiologic dependence of VO2 at very low levels of DO2 (330 mL/min.m2). Pathologic dependence of VO2 on DO2 entails two concepts: a) VO2 varies directly with DO2 over a wide range of DO2 and b) of particular import, tissue oxygen extraction is compromised. This pathologic supply dependence was initially identified in patients with ARDS; subsequently, it has been demonstrated in patients with sepsis and in a variety of other critically ill individuals. There are substantial, but not uniform, data documenting this dependence of VO2 on DO2 in ARDS. In some studies, this relationship correlates best with increased lactate concentrations. However, increased blood lactate concentrations do not accurately track other evidence of tissue hypoxia. Some researchers have attributed the finding of this supply dependency to artifact, when VO2 is determined by the arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference. However, when these methods are compared, the correlation is excellent. Others have raised the concern that appreciable changes in VO2, even over short periods of time, may result in physiologic increases in DO2. However, when \"control\" groups have been contemporaneously compared with patients with ARDS using the same methodology, they have not shown supply dependency. Interwoven throughout the studies reviewed is overwhelming and uniform evidence that both mixed venous oxygen tension (PVO2) and mixed venous oxygen content (CVO2) correlate poorly with cardiac output, DO2, or VO2. The inconsistencies in identifying pathologic DO2 dependency may well reflect the unknown variables that exist in patients with ARDS, perhaps better labeled, multiple organ system failure. CONCLUSIONS: Pathologic dependence of VO2 on DO2, especially the inability to increase tissue oxygen extraction, is present in most patients with ARDS and many other critically ill individuals. PVO2 and CVO2 are both unreliable indicators of cardiac output, DO2, or VO2.\r"

Patients with septic shock require higher levels of oxygen delivery (DO2) to maintain aerobic metabolism. When DO2 is inadequate, peripheral tissues switch to anaerobic metabolism and oxygen consumption decreases. The lactic acidosis that occurs is a reasonable clinical marker of supply dependency and inadequate tissue perfusion. Maximizing DO2 is an important part of the hemodynamic resuscitation of patients with septic shock. To achieve this goal, intravascular volume must be restored and the myocardial depression associated with sepsis must be treated to optimize cardiac output. The normalization of arterial lactate concentration is a reasonable goal of resuscitative efforts.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: Increased cardiac index, oxygen delivery (DO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2) patterns were shown to characterize the physiologic status of surviving high-risk surgical patients, and indicate increased metabolic needs; relatively normal DO2 and VO2 values were found to characterize the sequential pattern of nonsurvivors who developed an early oxygen debt followed by lethal organ failure. The cardiac index, DO2, and VO2 values empirically determined from survivors' patterns were shown to improve outcome in prospective randomized trials. The present study considers these criteria to evaluate the tissue perfusion status as well as the effects of therapy on tissue perfusion and oxygenation. OBJECTIVE: To summarize new information on the temporal patterns of DO2, VO2, and oxygen debt on outcome and the effects of fluids and inotropes on these patterns in a wide range of clinical, temporal, and physiologic conditions. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis based on data gathered prospectively using a specified protocol. PATIENTS: High-risk patients with accidental or elective surgical trauma, and patients with or without sepsis or septic shock and organ failure. SETTING: University-run county hospital with a large trauma service. INTERVENTIONS: Fluids, dobutamine, and dopamine at various times and at various doses throughout critical illness of postoperative, posttraumatic, septic, and hypovolemic patients with and without lethal and nonlethal organ failure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pattern of DO2 plotted against the corresponding VO2 values in 437 consecutive critically ill surgical patients showed a wide variability and poor correlation probably because complex clinical conditions may obscure the supply-dependent and supply-independent VO2 relationships observed in normal dogs bled or given bacterial infusions. However, the use of specific therapy by well-defined protocols was shown to provide objective evidence of efficacy. Significant increases in DO2 and VO2 were previously shown after whole blood, packed red cells, and colloid administration, but not after crystalloid administration. Dobutamine administration in 715 circumstances in postoperative, traumatic, septic patients and patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, and multiple organ failure significantly improved DO2 and VO2. Dopamine under comparable conditions produced less improvement in DO2 and VO2 than that of dobutamine; most of the VO2 changes were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The monitored patterns of cardiac index, DO2, and VO2 may be used to evaluate the adequacy of tissue perfusion as well as the relative effectiveness of alternative therapies. Second, these physiologic criteria may be used to titrate therapy in order to achieve optimal outcome. Third, after colloids optimally expand the plasma volume, dobutamine may be used to enhance flow and the distribution of flow in order to improve tissue oxygenation. Vasodilators may be used when hypertensive episodes occur or there is an inadequate response to inotropic agents. Vasopressors are used as a last resort, usually in the terminal or preterminal state.\r"

DESIGN: With approval of our Institutional Review Board, data were collected prospectively to compare bedside clinical assessment of the patient with the routine chest radiograph in determining the occurrence of new findings. Before review of the daily chest film, patients underwent careful evaluation of clinical and physiologic variables by critical care physicians, who then documented the new findings and the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required. These results were compared with the interpretations of the daily chest film by radiologists blinded to the clinical assessment. Correlations were made of the new major (requiring immediate intervention) and new minor (abnormal but not requiring immediate intervention) findings noted by clinical assessment and chest radiography. SETTING: This study was conducted in a ten-bed medical/surgical ICU admitting 650 to 750 patients/yr, a majority of whom require intubation and mechanical ventilation. PATIENTS: Seventy-seven episodes of intubation and mechanical ventilation in 74 patients were evaluated. Only patients with translaryngeal intubation and a requirement for mechanical ventilation beyond 24 hrs were considered for inclusion in this study. Major admitting diagnoses included malignancy, aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, liver failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Specific interventions were not made by study design; instead, clinical practice with and without the routine chest radiograph was compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The measure of comparison between the chest radiograph and clinical assessment was the correlation between the two for a number of major and minor findings defined in advance. A total of 538 chest radiographs were examined; of these, 354 (65.8%) did not disclose either new major or new minor findings as defined. One hundred sixty-three radiographs disclosed only new minor findings, 40.5% of which were anticipated by bedside assessment. However, in 13 (17.6%, 95% confidence interval 9% to 26%) of our 74 patients, new major findings were discovered only by chest radiography. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that, while a large percentage of radiographs will not disclose new findings, routine daily studies have a substantial impact on the management of intubated, mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU. These findings support the use of daily chest radiographs in critically ill patients.\r"

PATIENTS: Forty-eight critically ill adult patients, age 25 to 86 yrs. Patients entered the study when hypokalemia (potassium less than 3.5 mmol/L) was noted on routine laboratory blood analysis. Most common primary diagnoses on ICU admission included postoperative cardiac surgery (n = 9), sepsis and multiple organ system failure (n = 9), complicated myocardial infarction (n = 7), and respiratory failure (n = 5). INTERVENTION: Potassium chloride infusions (20, 30, or 40 mmol in 100 mL normal saline over 1 hr) were administered to patients for serum potassium levels of less than 3.5 but greater than 3.2 mmol/L (n = 26), 3.0 to 3.2 mmol/L (n = 11), and less than 3.0 mmol/L (n = 11), respectively. Serum and urine potassium levels were monitored during and for 1 hr after the infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All patients tolerated the infusions without evidence of hemodynamic compromise, ECG change, or new dysrhythmia requiring treatment. The mean maximum potassium increase was 0.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/L, 0.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/L, and 1.1 +/- 0.4 mmol/L in the 20-, 30-, and 40-mmol groups, respectively. The increase in serum potassium was maximal at the completion of the infusion and was significant (p less than .05) compared with baseline in all groups. Peak potassium levels were the same in patients with normal renal function (n = 33) compared with those with renal insufficiency (n = 15). Urinary excretion of potassium increased in all groups during the infusion and was significant (p less than .05) in the 30- and 40-mmol groups, but was no greater in those patients who had received diuretics (n = 8) compared with those patients who had not (n = 40). CONCLUSIONS: In the select group of hypokalemic patients studied, potassium infusions of 20 to 40 mmol delivered over 1 hr were safe to administer and effectively increased serum potassium levels in a dose-dependent and predictable fashion. Furthermore, these results were independent of the patient's underlying renal function or associated diuretic administration.\r"

SETTING: Operating room in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Seven patients undergoing elective aortocoronary artery bypass surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Before initiating cardiopulmonary bypass, the patients' hematocrit levels were decreased to approximately 15%. This hemodilution was done by removing a sufficient amount of autologous blood from the aortic cannula and replacing it with a sufficient amount of crystalloid solution. After the discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass, measurements were made at a hematocrit of approximately 15%. Then, after autologous blood infusion, measurements were made at a hematocrit of 20%, followed by more blood infusion to approximately 25% with repeat measurements. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The following measurements were made before hemodilution and then at all three levels of hemodilution: heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, and cardiac output. From these measurements, the following derived variables were calculated: cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance. From measurements of arterial oxygen content, mixed venous oxygen content, and cardiac output, intrapulmonary shunt (Qsp/Qt), oxygen uptake (VO2), oxygen extraction ratio, and oxygen delivery (DO2) were derived. The MAP was lowest (57 +/- 3 [SD] vs. 92 +/- 3 mm Hg) at the lowest hematocrit. The cardiac index was highest (4.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.6 L/min.m2) at the lowest hematocrit. DO2 was lowest at the lowest hematocrit but VO2 remained constant at all levels of hematocrit. The oxygen extraction ratio increased as hematocrit decreased. With progressive increases in hematocrit, DO2 increased and Qsp/Qt decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that, during hemodilution, tissue autoregulation of VO2 and utilization are not impaired, but gas exchange function (Qsp/Qt) is impaired.\r"

DESIGN: Thirty critically ill patients with evidence of severe sepsis and systemic hypoperfusion were prospectively studied. MEASUREMENTS: The anion gap was calculated as [Na+] + [K+] - [Cl-] - [HCO3]. A corrected anion gap was calculated as the anion gap minus the anionic contribution of lactate, phosphate, urate, and total serum proteins. The corrected anion gap is a marker of unmeasured anion less unmeasured cation concentration. RESULTS: The mean anion gap was 21.8 +/- 1.4 mmol/L and the corrected anion gap was 3.7 +/- 0.8 mmol/L. The mean arterial blood lactate concentration was 5.9 +/- 0.8 mmol/L. The magnitude of the lactate concentration correlated linearly with the anion gap (r2 = .61, lactate = 0.4 anion gap - 3.9, n = 30, p less than .01). The corrected anion gap was greater than 0 in 24 (80%) of 30 patients. The magnitude of the corrected anion gap correlated linearly with the anion gap (r2 = .66, corrected anion gap = 0.5 anion gap - 6.3, n = 30, p less than .01). Since the slope of the regression line for estimating corrected anion gap from anion gap was 0.5, the contribution of unmeasured anions was as important as lactate in determining the anion gap. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that lactic acidosis does not entirely account for the metabolic acidosis during severe sepsis. Furthermore, the increased corrected anion gap suggests the presence of an unidentified anion (or anions) that is (or are) responsible, in large part, for the development of metabolic acidosis in patients with sepsis.\r"

In liquid ventilation, perfluorocarbon is oxygenated, purged of CO2, and cycled into and out of the lungs using an investigational device. A new approach, perfluorocarbon-associated gas exchange, uses a conventional ventilator and combines features of liquid ventilation and continuous positive-pressure breathing. In 13 normal piglets, a volume of perfluorocarbon equivalent to the normal functional residual capacity (30 mL/kg) was instilled into the trachea, left in situ, and volume-regulated gas ventilation (FIO2 1.0) was resumed. For 1 hr, perfluorocarbon was continuously bubble-oxygenated within the lungs, where it directly participated in gas exchange. RESULTS: PaO2 and PaCO2 averaged 401 +/- 51 and 40 +/- 4 torr (53.6 +/- 6.8 and 5.3 +/- 0.5 kPa), respectively. Peak airway pressure during perfluorocarbon-associated gas exchange (22 +/- 2 cm H2O at 1 hr) and during continuous, positive-pressure breathing (23 +/- 4 cm H2O) were nearly identical. Venous oxygen saturation and pH were normal (73 +/- 8% and 7.43 +/- 0.05, respectively, at 1 hr). CONCLUSIONS: Perfluorocarbon-associated gas exchange was uniformly well tolerated, and its efficiency approached that of continuous positive-pressure breathing.

METHODS: Randomized, prospective, blinded trials in Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to hemorrhage and resuscitation, with or without pentoxifylline. RESULTS: Pentoxifylline had no effect on BP or cardiac output. However, tissue oxygenation and oxygen consumption were increased with pentoxifylline resuscitation. Pentoxifylline resuscitation also significantly decreased polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Pentoxifylline improves tissue oxygenation and oxygen consumption posthemorrhage and this effect is not due to increased cardiac output. Therefore, it must be due to improved microcirculatory blood flow. This effect may be due to decreased polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesiveness induced by pentoxifylline resuscitation.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized controlled study. INTERVENTIONS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to three groups: sham, cecal ligation and puncture, or alpha-tocopherol/cecal ligation and puncture (pretreatment with alpha-tocopherol before cecal ligation and puncture). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cecal ligation and puncture group had a significantly (p less than .05) higher SvO2 and lower C (a-v)O2, pHv, and survival rate when compared with alpha-tocopherol/cecal ligation and puncture and sham groups. No difference in pHa existed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The alpha-tocopherol treatment improves survival in sepsis. RBC deformability during sepsis is prevented by alpha-tocopherol, suggesting that free radicals may cause the decrease in RBC deformability. This study provides indirect evidence that decreased RBC deformability may play a role in the physiologic peripheral shunting and decreased microcirculatory flow that occurs during sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We investigated the hypothesis that, in a newborn piglet during normoxia, hypoxia, and hyperoxia, increasing aortic pressure transiently by intermittent short-duration aortic compression would affect left-to-right shunting of blood and thus increase pulmonary artery blood flow, pulmonary arterial PO2, and aortic PO2 proximal to the point of compression. We also investigated whether a balloon atrial septostomy, by providing an open channel for communication between the right- and left-sided circulations, would further improve pulmonary blood flow and aortic PO2. Studies were performed in eight 7- to 10-day-old newborn piglets in three phases (FIO2 of 0.21, 0.12, and 1.0) before and after balloon arterial septostomy in each piglet. Blood gas measurements and hemodynamic variables were recorded before and at the end of a 30-sec period of aortic compression. RESULTS: During aortic compression, all the animals demonstrated a 50 to 70 mm Hg increase in aortic pressure proximal to the compression. Before balloon septostomy, there were 21%, 41%, and 8% increases in aortic PO2 in the room air, hypoxic, and hyperoxic phases of the experiment, respectively. There were also statistically significant increments in pulmonary blood flow and arterial pressures. After balloon septostomy, there were 35%, 25%, and 21% increments in aortic PO2 during the room air, hypoxic, and hyperoxic phases of the experiment, respectively. However, there was no statistically significant further improvement in the effects of aortic compression on PO2 with septostomy compared with those effects before septostomy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increasing systemic arterial pressures in order to forcibly affect left-to-right shunting of blood may be potentially beneficial in the management of hypoxia in situations where low pulmonary artery blood flow may be contributing to hypoxia, e.g., in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.\r"

In this study we determined anti-Hp with a specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in 100 healthy volunteers who were at the same time investigated for active H pylori infection by means of the 13C-urea breath test. Forty nine per cent had a high anti-Hp titre, but only 24% had active H pylori infection. Our study suggests that a considerable number of healthy people previously infected with H pylori have spontaneously eliminated this microorganism. We suggest that the inability of ulcer patients to eliminate H pylori may be important in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease.\r"

The pathogenesis is thought to involve venous congestion with gastric mucosal capillary dilatation. We studied the relation between gastric mucosal capillary dilatation, measured morphometrically, and endoscopic appearances in 74 patients with portal hypertension and 20 control subjects. We also investigated the frequency of gastric colonisation with Helicobacter pylori. Mucosal capillaries in patients were significantly dilated compared with control subjects (p less than 0.001) but the degree of dilatation was not related to the severity of the endoscopic appearances. H pylori was identified in 19 of 74 (26%) patients but was not related to the severity of the endoscopic appearances. These results suggest that other factors in addition to mucosal venous and capillary congestion are important in the pathogenesis of endoscopic congestive gastropathy and that gastric colonisation with H pylori is unlikely to be one of these factors.\r"

At 95 weeks of age erosions were apparent over 80% of the gastric mucosa and this was associated with a significant decline in the numbers and mucus content of the mucosal epithelial cells. The rate of stem cell proliferation in the neck region was also significantly lower than that found in 9 week old animals. The administration of 50 mg/kg colloidal bismuth subcitrate for 14 days to 9 week old animals resulted in slight hypertrophy of the mucosal epithelial cells. When 95 week animals were placed on the same regimen there was a decline in the number of deep erosions in the mucosa and an increase in the number and mucin content of the mucosal epithelial cells. A significant increase in the proliferation of the stem cell population was also observed after colloidal bismuth subcitrate administration. It is suggested that colloidal bismuth subcitrate may ameliorate the increased susceptibility to harmful agents that occurs with age.\r"

Duplex parameters of vessel diameter, mean velocity, and flow volume were determined serially in the basal state and after stimulation. Changes were compared with baseline values. Superior mesenteric artery parameters were significantly increased over baseline values after a liquid test meal, but ingestion of saline did not cause any changes. Hormones infused simultaneously at postprandial concentrations did not change mesenteric blood flow. When they were infused at pharmacological doses, however, a significant increase in flow parameters was observed. Pretreatment with atropine significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the mesenteric blood flow response to meal stimulation (57%). These data suggest that the four hormones tested are not of quantitative importance in regulating postprandial superior mesenteric artery blood flow. A cholinergic nervous reflex, however, participates in the control of food induced mesenteric artery flow changes.\r"

The wet and dry weight, pH, and water content of the stools were similar on the two diets. On the high sugar diet mouth-to-anus transit time was significantly prolonged, despite a shortened mouth-to-caecum transit time. The faecal concentration of total bile acids and the faecal concentration of secondary bile acids increased significantly. Diet affected neither the serum bile acid pattern nor the concentration. Breath hydrogen tests showed significantly enhanced H2 production on the high sugar diet. We conclude that the quantity of refined sugar in the diet can significantly influence gut function and the composition of bowel contents.\r"

We have evaluated the histology and the microvascular permeability of (a) the effect of nicotine alone or in combination with ethanol on the gastric mucosa of rats and (b) the effect of feeding and sucralfate on the mucosa of rats treated with nicotine and ethanol. Mucosal injury was assessed histologically by the depth of injury and microvascular permeability by the leakage of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled albumin. Our results show that nicotine induced microscopic mucosal damage and accentuated the damage induced by alcohol. The damaging effects on mucosa of nicotine and ethanol, alone or in combination, were reduced by pretreatment with sucralfate. Similarly, feeding reduced the degree of mucosal injury. Nicotine and ethanol increased leakage of albumin into the interstitium and the leakage was reduced after sucralfate pretreatment. This study substantiates the adverse effect of smoking on mucosal damage. Vascular factors are probably involved in the pathogenesis.\r"

There was no correlation between dietary gluten intake and the degree of enteropathy in the 51 patients taking a normal diet, whereas biopsy specimens were normal in 24 of the 31 patients on a gluten free diet, all previously having been abnormal. Eighteen patients on gluten containing diets had normal jejunal histology and in seven of these all tests of small intestinal morphology and function were entirely normal. Intestinal permeability was abnormal and serum antigliadin antibodies were present in most patients with enteropathy. Studies of acid secretion in seven patients showed that hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria did not lead to abnormal permeability in the absence of enteropathy. This study shows that a combination of objective tests of small intestinal architecture and function will detect abnormalities in most dermatitis herpetiformis patients, including some with histologically normal jejunal biopsy specimens. Nevertheless there is a small group in whom all conventional intestinal investigations are entirely normal.\r"

One possible mechanism is by carrier mediated Na(+)-acetate cotransport since acetate, like glucose, stimulates intestinal Na+ and water absorption in vivo. Uptake of radioactive carbon acetate by small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles was not saturable or Na+ dependent and did not respond to osmotic shrinkage of the vesicles. This suggests that acetate binds to the membranes but is not transported into the intravesicular space and argues against carrier mediated Na+ acetate cotransport. These results are consistent with acetate absorption by a non-mediated diffusion and suggest that the stimulation of water and Na+ absorption by acetate in vivo is largely due to osmotic forces and solvent drag.\r"

During the hypnotic relaxation period subjects were hypnotised before lactulose ingestion and were instructed to experience relaxation till the orocaecal transit time had elapsed. During the acceleration suggestion period subjects were hypnotised before lactulose ingestion and were repeatedly instructed to imagine the acceleration of lactulose through the intestine until transit time had elapsed. The mean orocaecal transit time was significantly longer during the hypnotic relaxation period (mean (SEM) 133 (8) min) than during the control period (93 (13) min). The mean orocaecal transit time during the acceleration suggestion period was 105 (26) minutes and was not significantly different from the mean transit time during the control period. The individual values during the acceleration suggestion period were scattered. We conclude that lactulose orocaecal transit time is delayed during hypnotic relaxation.\r"

This DNA probe can specifically distinguish M paratuberculosis from a wide range of other organisms, including members of the M avium-M intracellulare complex. When used in conjunction with the PCR amplification technique DNA probe PCR278 could detect as little as 10 fg (equivalent to two genomes) starting material of M paratuberculosis genomic DNA. Use of PCR amplification assays based on IS900, for the detection of M paratuberculosis, and homologous IS elements found in disease isolates of M avium should greatly help our understanding of the role of these organisms in Crohn's disease and other chronic inflammatory disorders.\r"

Eighty six male Wistar rats were fed experimental diets containing either 5% saturated fat or 20% saturated fat. Colorectal tumours were induced by intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane, and control rats received saline. Animals were killed at intervals up to 26 weeks after the last injection of carcinogen for histology and lipid analysis. Cell membrane fatty acids in colonic mucosa and colorectal tumours were determined by gas liquid chromatography. Animals fed the 20% fat diet developed more carcinomas (28 cancers in 14 rats) than those fed the 5% fat diet (14 cancers in 15 rats; chi 2 = 8.03, p = 0.0046) but they did not develop significantly more adenomas (28 and 24 respectively). Cell membrane fatty acid analysis showed a considerable increase in the content of arachidonic acid (20:4, n-6) in the tumours (mean (SEM) 11.7 (1.5)%) compared with colonic mucosa (4.2 (0.4)%; p less than 0.05). Dietary fatty acid composition was also found to influence the profile of fatty acids in the colonic mucosa. This study suggests that a high saturated fat diet promotes the malignant transformation of colorectal adenomas. The colorectal tumours were characterised by an increased cell membrane arachidonic acid, the precursor of putative cancer promoting prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve of 178 (7%) liver transplant patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after transplantation. The indications for ERCP were persistent or late onset cholestasis, recurrent cholangitis, and suspected biliary leaks or strictures. The time between transplantation and ERCP ranged from 44 to 330 days (median 153 days). Biliary complications diagnosed by ERCP included biliary sludge in the form of casts, calculi, or debris (n = 7); bile leaks (n = 2); a biliary stricture (n = 1), and complete biliary obstruction (n = 1). One patient had a normal cholangiogram after transplantation. Biliary sludge was detected by ultrasound before ERCP in only one of six patients. Eight patients underwent endoscopic papillotomy, followed by clearance of biliary sludge in four and dilatation of a biliary stricture in one. Two patients bled after papillotomy but neither required surgical intervention. At a median follow up of 1.2 years (range 0.5-2.8 years), nine patients are well and three have died. ERCP provides both accurate diagnosis of biliary complications after liver transplantation and treatment that obviates the need for additional surgery in selected patients.\r"

Control studies were performed using the gall bladders from six patients (age and sex matched) with chronic cholecystitis and four with primary biliary cirrhosis. A range of histological abnormalities was present in gall bladders from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis including a mild to moderate degree of epithelial hyperplasia, pseudogland formation, and mononuclear cell infiltrate of the epithelium; moderate to severe chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate and fibrosis affecting the superficial and deep layers of the gall bladder wall; and minimal smooth muscle hypertrophy. These abnormalities were non-specific and were also present in gall bladders from patients with chronic cholecystitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Vasculitis and granulomas were not present in the patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Immunohistochemistry showed that the superficial and deep mononuclear cell infiltrate in primary sclerosing cholangitis gall bladders was composed predominantly of lymphocytes, in contrast to chronic cholecystitis where macrophages were found in similar or greater numbers. Moreover, T lymphocytes (activated and resting) were present throughout the lymphocytic infiltrate and were apposed to the base and interdigitated between the biliary epithelial cells in significantly greater numbers than in chronic cholecystitis gall bladders. B lymphocytes were present only in lymphoid follicles. Comparative studies using liver biopsy specimens from three of the primary sclerosing cholangitis patients showed a similar T lymphocyte portal tract infiltrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin was measured by a novel enzyme linked immunosorbent assay with a monoclonal antibody specific for the complexed form. Patients with severe illness had lower concentrations of total alpha 2 macroglobulin and higher concentrations of complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin than those with mild illness, and in the majority of severe attacks the abnormal amounts of complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin were present throughout the eight days of the study. The proportion of total alpha 2 macroglobulin in the uncomplexed form, however, was generally greater than 90%, and in 26% of the mild cases completely normal concentrations of uncomplexed alpha 2 macroglobulin (greater than 99% of total) were found throughout the eight days of the study. This suggests that exhaustion of alpha 2 macroglobulin in plasma is unlikely to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.\r"

Altogether 107 patients (duodenal ulcer, n = 88; prepyloric ulcer, n = 14; gastric ulcer, n = 3; mixed sites, n = 2) with refractory peptic ulcer - that is ulcer unhealed after at least two months' treatment with cimetidine 0.8 g or 1 g daily or with ranitidine 0.3 g daily - were randomly allocated to receive either omeprazole 40 mg daily (n = 54) or to continue treatment with the same H2 receptor antagonist and at the same dose (n = 53) for up to eight weeks. The patients in the two treatment groups were well matched demographically. Healing by 'intent to treat' analysis was as follows: at four weeks, omeprazole 46 of 54 (85%), H2 receptor antagonist 18 of 53 (34%) (p less than 0.0001); and at eight weeks, 52 of 54 (96%) and 30 of 53 (57%) respectively (p less than 0.0001).

  ".U": "91225188\r", 
  ".W": "We measured lumbar spine, femoral neck, and forearm bone mineral (BMD) in 24 women (14 premenopausal and 10 postmenopausal) who had been treated with total thyroidectomy and 131 Iodine ablation therapy for nonanaplastic thyroid carcinoma and 24 case controls. At the time of the study, all patients were free of cancer (negative 131 Iodine whole body scan and serum thyroglobulin levels less than 0.3 micrograms/L) and all were receiving doses of T4 sufficiently high to prevent a rise in a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration after an iv bolus of TRH. Femoral neck BMD were significantly reduced in both the premenopausal women (89 +/- 3.8% of case controls, 95% CI, 81 to 98) and postmenopausal women (77 +/- 3.9% of case controls; 95% CI, 68 to 86) receiving T4. Lumbar spine BMD and forearm BMD were unaffected in the premenopausal women, but significantly reduced in the postmenopausal women receiving T4 (lumbar spine BMD = 84 +/- 6.2% of case controls; 95% CI, 70 to 98 and forearm BMD = 89 +/- 5.6% of case controls; 95% CI, 76 to 101). Serum bone Gla-protein, a marker of bone turnover, was significantly increased in both the premenopausal and the postmenopausal women receiving T4 compared to case controls (P less than 0.001 for the difference between patient groups and controls). Whereas the cumulative dose of T4 was highly correlated with the femoral neck BMD in the premenopausal patients (r = 0.528; P less than 0.05); the presence of hypogonadism was the main determinant of the lumbar spine and forearm BMD. This data confirms that premenopausal and postmenopausal women receiving suppressive doses of T4 for thyroid carcinoma have diminished bone mineral measurements and are at risk for osteoporosis.\r"

Both PYD and DPD excretion (nanomoles per mmol creatinine) was elevated in the thyrotoxic patients compared to 287 controls; median 131 vs. 26 and 37.5 vs. 7.2, respectively, P less than 0.0001. In premenopausal women mean urinary pyridinium cross-link excretion and serum osteocalcin levels were similar in both T4-treated and matched control groups, despite suppression of serum TSH concentrations to below 0.1 mU/L in 14 of the 20 taking T4. In postmenopausal women mean (+/- 1 SE) urinary PYD excretion (nanomoles per mmol creatinine) was raised in those taking T4, relative to euthyroid controls; 40.0 +/- 2.7 vs. 32.1 +/- 2.3, P less than 0.05. DPD excretion and serum osteocalcin levels were also higher, but not significantly. When only the T4-treated women with a subnormal serum TSH were considered the difference in PYD excretion was more marked, and mean DPD excretion was also significantly elevated; 13.7 +/- 1.3 vs. 10.1 +/- 0.8, P less than 0.05. Conclusion: bone collagen breakdown is increased in thyrotoxicosis, and in postmenopausal women taking sufficient T4 to suppress serum TSH. Similarly treated premenopausal women appear to be at lower risk.\r"

Serum TSH concentration was assayed at night, from 2200-0200 h, and in the morning, both basally and 30 min after iv injection of 200 micrograms synthetic TRH. Patients with hypercortisolism showed significantly reduced serum total T4 and T3 and free T3 concentrations and increased serum reverse T3 levels. Their mean baseline serum TSH concentration in the morning, albeit slightly lower, did not significantly differ from those of controls. The mean peak TSH value after TRH was significantly reduced, and a blunted TSH response to TRH was found in 4 out of 10 patients. At variance with normal controls, who showed nighttime TSH values 63-228% higher than morning values, 9 out of 10 patients had nighttime levels not different from or even lower than those in the morning; the remaining patient had nighttime TSH values marginally (33%) higher than in the morning. An inverse relationship (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001) was found between serum cortisol and TSH values both at night and in the morning. No differences were found either in the pattern of TSH secretion or in the TSH response to TRH between patients with ACTH-dependent and those with ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome. These results show a substantial impairment of TSH secretion, and in particular the loss of the nocturnal surge of the hormone, in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Although the origin of the nocturnal TSH rise is probably multifactorial, cortisol, at least when secreted in excess, appears to play an important role in its regulation.\r"

The diabetic subjects and the normal subjects did not differ in mean blood pressure, serum electrolytes, and creatinine clearance, except for an increase in fasting plasma glucose (P less than 0.001) in the diabetic subjects. A 100-mmol sodium intake for 4 days produced an increase in basal plasma renin activity (P less than 0.01), plasma 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OHB; P less than 0.05), and PA (P less than 0.05), and a decrease in urinary sodium excretion (P less than 0.001) in the two groups. These parameters were similar in the two groups. ACTH injection produced significant increases in plasma cortisol, plasma corticosterone, plasma 18-OHB, and PA (P less than 0.005 or P less than 0.001), and graded AII infusions produced significant increases in plasma 18-OHB and PA (P less than 0.05 or P less than 0.01) during both 170- and 100-mmol sodium intakes in the two groups. In the diabetic subjects, however, the responses of plasma 18-OHB and PA to both ACTH injection and graded AII infusions on a 100-mmol, but not on a 170-mmol, sodium intake were subnormal (P less than 0.05 or P less than 0.01) and were similar to those on a 170-mmol sodium intake. These results indicate a lack of enhanced responsiveness of plasma 18-OHB and PA to both ACTH and AII during moderate sodium restriction in nonazotemic type II diabetic subjects with normoreninemia. It appears that these subjects have selective unresponsiveness of adrenal zona glomerulosa to sodium depletion per se, but not to ACTH or AII.\r"

Maximal rates of androgen (androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone) production were induced by treating the cells for 4 days with LH (10 ng/mL) in the presence of insulin-like growth factor-I (greater than or equal to 30 ng/mL). The additional presence of recombinant activin-A (1-100 ng/mL) in culture medium caused dose-dependent suppression of thecal cell androgen production, with 50% maximal inhibition occurring at an activin-A concentration of about 10 ng/mL. Progesterone production was only suppressed by high dose (100 ng/mL) activin-A, and inhibition of steroid production occurred without inhibition of DNA synthesis (tritiated thymidine uptake). These results reveal a potent and selective inhibitory action of activin-A on thecal cell androgen synthesis, consistent with a paracrine function for activin(s) in modulating follicular androgen biosynthesis in the human ovary.\r"

We examined the relationship between diet-induced changes in glucose metabolism and changes in skeletal muscle insulin-sensitive tyrosine kinase activity in 12 nondiabetic subjects. Subjects were fed a traditional, high carbohydrate Pima Indian diet and a modern, high fat western diet for 2 weeks in a randomized cross-over design. At the end of each dietary period, glucose tolerance was assessed, insulin sensitivity (SI) was estimated by Bergman's minimal model method, and insulin receptor concentration and tyrosine kinase activity were determined on lectin-purified extracts from quadriceps femoris muscle. Compared to the traditional diet, the modern diet was associated with a deterioration of glucose tolerance and an increase in glucose-induced plasma insulin levels. As expected, SI changes were associated with opposite changes in plasma insulin levels. However, the changes in maximal tyrosine kinase activity were negatively correlated with changes in SI (r = -0.69; P less than 0.01) and positively correlated with changes in plasma glucose (r = 0.70; P less than 0.01) and insulin response to glucose (r = 0.57; P less than 0.025). These results suggest that the site of diet-induced changes in insulin action is beyond the insulin-sensitive tyrosine kinase. The results further suggest that the kinase activity is modulated by prevailing plasma insulin levels.\r"

Patients were sampled every 10 min for 4 h, and LH plasma concentrations were determined by the use of an immunofluorimetric assay. The program Detect was used for both pulse detection and data deconvolution, i.e. for instantaneous secretory rate computation, on LH time series. The presence of episodic LH secretion was observed in all patients, and LH pulse frequency ranged between 3.5 +/- 0.3 and 3.8 +/- 0.2 peaks/4 h among the four groups. LH pulse amplitude was significantly reduced in patients affected by hypothalamic amenorrhea with LH plasma levels lower than 3 IU/L (0.7 +/- 0.1 IU/L; P less than 0.01) and significantly increased in patients with hyperandrogenic amenorrhea (6.8 +/- 0.3 IU/L; P less than 0.01) compared to levels in the other groups under study. Instantaneous secretory rate computation permitted the optimal resolution of the secretory events and demonstrated that the duration of gonadotrope secretory bursts ranged from 22.8 +/- 1.4 to 26.8 +/- 2.3 min in amenorrheic patients and did not depend on LH, PRL, or sex steroid plasma levels. In conclusion, the present study shows the presence of significant LH pulsatile release in amenorrheic patients, suggesting that in amenorrheic, as in normally cycling, women the secretory bursts from the gonadotropes have the same duration, despite the plasma LH, PRL, or steroid hormone levels.\r"

If this is so, estrogen receptors should be demonstrable within parathyroid tissue. Seven human parathyroid adenomas and five samples of normal bovine parathyroid tissue were examined using classical hormone-binding techniques. In no case was there evidence of displaceable estrogen binding of high affinity and low capacity. To exclude the presence of receptors within a small subset of the cells, five of the human adenomas were further studied by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to the human estrogen receptor. In no case was there evidence of estrogen receptors. We conclude that the hypocalcemic action of estrogen replacement is unlikely to be mediated via a classical estrogen receptor within the parathyroid, although normal parathyroid tissue was not studied.\r"

To test this hypothesis in man, we have partially purified IGF-I receptors from liver, muscle, and adipose tissue and studied their interaction with PI, insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II. With some tissue to tissue variation, [125I]insulin binding was 4- to 8-fold greater than IGF-I binding. Unlabeled IGF-I at about 1 x 10(-9 M, IGF-II at about 1 x 10(-8) M, and insulin at about 1 x 10(-6) M displace 50% the binding of [125I]IGF-I to its receptor, whereas PI at 1 x 10(-6) M displaces less than 20% of the binding of [125I]IGF-I to its receptor. We conclude that in human liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, PI does not interact with the IGF-I receptor at a higher affinity than insulin, and the affinity of IGF-I receptors is several-fold lower than that of insulin receptors. It is, therefore, unlikely that if PI were to be administered to man any of its biological effects would be by interacting with the IGF-I receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of androgen-sensitive hair follicles is mediated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is formed in these tissues by 5 alpha-reduction of testosterone. A possible mechanism for increased body hair in some human populations might, therefore, be an increase in 5 alpha-reductase activity, resulting in elevated tissue levels of DHT. If present, this finding could have other important clinical implications, since the 5 alpha-reductase enzyme is pivotal in the pathophysiology of prostatic disease. To explore differences in clinical and biochemical parameters of androgen action, we conducted a study of 184 caucasian and Chinese subjects in whom we evaluated chest hair density and serum levels of androgen precursors and 5 alpha-reduced androgen metabolites. Differences in chest hair density were most notable in the men, in whom comparative mean chest hair scores (using a scale of 0-4) were 3.0 vs. 0.8 (P less than 0.0001), caucasian vs. Chinese. Levels of 5 alpha-reduced androgen products were also strikingly higher in the caucasian vs. Chinese subjects. Serum 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide levels (nanomoles per L) were 34.7 +/- 2.4 vs. 19.7 +/- 0.9 (P less than 0.001) for the men and 21.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 9.4 +/- 0.6 (P less than 0.001) for the women, and serum levels of androsterone glucuronide (nanomoles per L) were 179 +/- 26 vs. 107 +/- 7 (P less than 0.01) for the caucasian vs. Chinese men and 173 +/- 23 vs. 81 +/- 9 (P less than 0.001) for the women. Serum levels of total and bioavailable testosterone did not differ between the racial groups, but serum levels of the precursor androgens, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstenedione, were significantly higher in the caucasian vs. Chinese men, but not in the women. We conclude that increased serum levels of 5 alpha-reduced androgen metabolites in caucasians vs. Chinese subjects provide circumstantial evidence for a racial difference in 5 alpha-reductase activity and suggest a mechanism for the increased body hair observed in the caucasian men. Increased levels of precursor androgens may also play a role.\r"

  ".W": "Acute activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis with CRH has been reported to suppress gonadotropin secretion in women of reproductive age. In this study we specifically examined the effects of increasing doses of human CRH (hCRH) on circulating concentrations of ACTH, cortisol, and gonadotropins in five agonadal women, aged 46-65 (mean, 51.2) yr. The subjects had undergone either natural menopause or surgical removal of their ovaries at least 1 yr before study. Each woman was studied on four separate occasions and received either saline or hCRH at a dose of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 micrograms/kg BW through an indwelling iv catheter in a randomized, single blind fashion. During each experiment, five sequential iv injections of the same dose of hCRH or saline were administered at 90-min intervals over an 8-h period, followed by a 10-micrograms iv bolus of GnRH to test for pituitary gonadotropin responsiveness. Blood samples for measurement of LH, FSH, PRL, ACTH, and cortisol were obtained at 15-min intervals through an indwelling iv in the contralateral arm. Episodic pulses of LH secretion were analyzed using the Cluster computer program. Transverse mean LH, FSH, and PRL levels did not change with increasing hCRH doses. Mean (+/- SEM) LH pulse frequency [saline, 5.2 +/- 0.4/8 h; hCRH, (0.5 micrograms/kg), 4.8 +/- 0.2; hCRH (1 microgram/kg), 5.2 +/- 0.2; hCRH (2 micrograms/kg), 5.4 +/- 0.2] and amplitude [saline, 14.4 +/- 4.2 IU/L; hCRH (0.5 microgram/kg), 14.0 +/- 2.4; hCRH (1 microgram/kg), 15.8 +/- 2.5; hCRH (2 micrograms/kg), 17.2 +/- 2.9] did not differ among groups. Although the transverse mean levels of ACTH [saline, 8.7 +/- 0.2 pmol/L; hCRH (0.5 microgram/kg), 12.4 +/- 0.3; hCRH (1 microgram/kg), 11.5 +/- 0.4; hCRH (2 micrograms/kg), 12.8 +/- 0.4] did not change with increasing doses of hCRH, the duration of cortisol peaks after hCRH was longer and accounted for the increased transverse mean at each dose [saline, 152.8 +/- 4.1 nmol/L; hCRH (0.5 microgram/kg), 265.4 +/- 10.5; hCRH (1 microgram/kg), 329.7 +/- 14.3; hCRH (2 micrograms/kg), 348.2 +/- 12.1]. These findings suggest that ever larger doses of pulsatile hCRH continue to increase adrenal output of cortisol secondary to more sustained ACTH responses. However, hCRH-induced acute hypercortisolism does not alter gonadotropin secretion in agonadal women.\r"

To test the latter hypothesis, the LH response, measured both as bioactivity (B) and immunoactivity (IR), to increasing doses of LHRH ranging from 0.625-5 micrograms, administered as an iv bolus, was evaluated in 10 young (20-45 yr old) and 10 elderly (64-78 yr old) monks. Both basal B- and IR-LH levels were significantly higher in elderly men. The maximal response to each dose was similar in young and elderly men when measured as IR-LH, but the B-LH response was higher in elderly men. The B/IR LH ratio increased with increasing LH levels. The mean half-life of plasma IR-LH in the elderly was significantly longer than that in the group of young men and significantly longer than the mean half-life of B-LH. It is concluded that the sensitivity of the gonadotrophs to LHRH is not decreased in elderly men. This suggests that the attenuated response of LH levels to antiopioids and antiestrogens, respectively, as well as the reduced number of spontaneous high amplitude LH pulses in elderly men may, instead, be the consequence of the release of a decreased mass of LHRH at each pulse.\r"

  ".W": "We tested whether FFAs influence glucose uptake by human peripheral tissues in vivo. Whole body glucose uptake, FFA turnover, energy expenditure and substrate oxidation rates, forearm glucose and FFA uptake, and nonoxidative glycolysis (net release of alanine and lactate) were measured in 14 normal male subjects in the basal state (0-240 min; serum insulin, approximately 5 microU/mL) and during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia (240-360 min; approximately 75 microU/mL) on 2 separate occasions, once during elevation of plasma FFA by infusions of Intralipid and heparin (plasma FFA, 4.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/L; 180-240 vs. 300-360 min) and once during infusion of saline (plasma FFA, 0.50 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.02 +/- 0.07 mmol/L, respectively). In the basal state, whole body glucose disposal remained unchanged, but the fate of glucose was significantly altered toward diminished oxidation (7.3 +/- 0.8 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.05, saline vs. Intralipid) and increased nonoxidative glycolysis (P less than 0.05). Elevation of plasma FFA significantly increased forearm glucose uptake (1.0 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.7 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.01) and nonoxidative glycolysis (net release of alanine and lactate, 0.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.4 mumol glucose equivalents/kg.min; P less than 0.05). During hyperinsulinemia, FFA decreased whole body glucose disposal (38 +/- 2 vs. 30 +/- 3 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.001) due to a decrease in glucose oxidation (13 +/- 1 vs. 7 +/- 1 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.01, saline vs. Intralipid), and forearm glucose uptake (31 +/- 4 vs. 24 +/- 6 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.01, saline vs. Intralipid). Under these conditions, 7 +/- 2% and 3 +/- 1% (P less than 0.05) of forearm glucose uptake could be accounted for by nonoxidative glycolysis in the Intralipid and saline studies, respectively. In summary, 1) elevation of plasma FFA concentrations suppresses the rate of carbohydrate oxidation to a rate that, both basally and during hyperinsulinemia, is similar to that reported for insulin-independent glucose oxidation in the brain; 2) basally, forearm glucose uptake is increased by FFA; and 3) during hyperinsulinemia, FFA inhibit glucose uptake by forearm tissues. We conclude that the interaction between glucose and FFA fuels in human forearm tissues is dependent upon the ambient insulin concentration; the increase in basal glucose uptake would be compatible with the increase need of glucose for FFA reesterification; the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake supports operation of the glucose-FFA cycle in human forearm tissues.\r"

We administered GnRH in pulsatile and continuous regimens in varying order to each of five women with hypothalamic amenorrhea and presumed endogenous GnRH deficiency. Mean serum levels of GnRH were similar during the pulsatile and continuous regimens. All women ovulated during the pulsatile regimen (progesterone, greater than 31.8 nmol/L (10 ng/mL); none ovulated during the continuous regimen. Compared to pretreatment levels, FSH and estradiol, as measured by RIA, and LH, as measured by bioassay, increased significantly during the pulsatile GnRH regimen, but not during the continuous regimen. However, LH and alpha-subunit, as measured by RIA, increased significantly during both continuous and pulsatile GnRH administration. We conclude that a pulsatile pattern of GnRH is essential to normal functioning of the human female reproductive axis. Continuous administration of GnRH, producing mean serum levels of the peptide indistinguishable from those found during pulsatile administration, stimulates some rise in a nonbioactive form of radioimmunoassayable LH-like material and alpha-subunit, but does not stimulate bioactive LH, FSH, estradiol, or progesterone and does not lead to ovulation.\r"

Fourteen male alcoholics and 13 matched nonalcoholics were studied. Although alcoholics and controls had similar decrements in cortisol levels after metyrapone blockade, plasma ACTH and 11-deoxycortisol levels in alcoholics were 60% (P less than 0.05) and 40% (P less than 0.05), respectively, of control values. To further clarify defects in the HPA axis of the alcoholic group, each subject underwent a CRH stimulation test. Compared to control subjects, alcoholics had a significantly blunted plasma ACTH response to CRH stimulation (P less than 0.05). Timing of the peak plasma ACTH response was altered in alcoholics. Whereas all control subjects had a peak plasma ACTH response 30 min after CRH administration, 50% of alcoholics demonstrated a peak plasma ACTH response 60 min after CRH administration, and 50% demonstrated a peak plasma ACTH response 30 min after CRH. To determine if adrenal function was also impaired, alcoholics and controls underwent a standard (250 micrograms) and a submaximal (0.250 micrograms) Cortrosyn stimulation test. Controls demonstrated a significant cortisol response to both standard and low dose Cortrosyn. Although alcoholics had a cortisol response similar to that of controls after the standard dose of Cortrosyn, they did not have a statistically significant rise in cortisol after the submaximal dose of Cortrosyn. Twenty-four-hour urinary free cortisol levels were 2-fold higher in alcoholics compared to controls. In summary, although a subset of alcoholics demonstrated enhanced basal production of cortisol, most alcoholics had a blunted response to acute intervening stress, including CRH, low dose ACTH-(1-24), and metyrapone blockade. These data suggest that alcoholics have ethanol-induced HPA axis injury, resulting in an inappropriately reduced response to nonethanol-induced stress.\r"

Growth rates of infants treated daily from birth with GH (INFGH; n = 9; 100 micrograms/kg, sc) were compared to those of infants given saline (INFc; n = 10), infants whose mothers received saline from the second trimester of pregnancy through 7 weeks postpartum (CON; n = 9), infants of mothers who received GH during pregnancy only from the second trimester to parturition (PRG; n = 8), infants of mothers who received GH during lactation only from parturition through 7 weeks postpartum (LAC; n = 9), and infants of mothers who received GH during the second trimester of pregnancy through 7 weeks postpartum (PRG/LAC; n = 8). Mothers receiving GH were given 250 micrograms/kg, sc, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Infants were allowed to nurse ad libitum. Although infant birth weights were similar among the six groups, body weights at 7 weeks of age were significantly greater in PRG/LAC infants (0.77 +/- 0.03 kg) compared to those in CON (0.66 +/- 0.02 kg), INFc (0.62 +/- 0.03 kg), LAC (0.62 +/- 0.04 kg), and INFGH infants (0.62 +/- 0.01 kg), with infants of PRG mothers intermediate (0.71 +/- 0.02 kg) between them. By 35 weeks of age, after infants had been weaned by their mothers, body weights were similar among all groups. Serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) rose significantly in all infants during the study period. Although IGF-I levels did not vary significantly among the treatment groups, average concentrations of IGF-I were significantly related to weight gains. Analyses of milk composition revealed that total protein, lactose, and IGF-I levels were similar among groups, whereas the percentage of fat in the milk was significantly higher in PRG/LAC mothers. Milk protein content was significantly related to weight gain. These data suggest that neonatal body weight gain can be accelerated in nursing infants whose mothers have received GH from at least the second trimester of pregnancy through the lactational interval. Since infants of mothers receiving GH during lactation only were not different from controls, the effect of GH in this treatment paradigm may be mammogenic rather than galactopoietic per se.\r"

  ".W": "An adolescent female with type B insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia is described. Evidence presented suggests that hyperinsulinemia leads to an increase in serum total and free testosterone. Support for this hypothesis is noted during an in vivo experiment in which large doses of regular insulin (305 U/kg-day) were infused iv, and multiple serum total testosterone measurements obtained. After 35 days of iv insulin therapy, the serum total testosterone values rose from 4.9 nmol/L (142 ng/dL) to 22.8 nmol/L (660 ng/dL), and the ovarian volume increased 2-fold. Basal (9.8 nmol/L; 282 ng/dL) and stimulated (16.8 nmol/L; 481 ng/dL) androstenedione measurements were elevated, and the dehydroepiandrosterone/androstenedione ratio was low, suggesting increased 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity. After resolution of the insulin-resistant state and the concomitant hyperinsulinemia, the serum total testosterone values returned to normal. This case illustrates that long term hyperinsulinemia leads to elevation of serum total testosterone.\r"

  ".U": "91225209\r", 
  ".W": "The synthetic hexapeptide GH-releasing peptide (GHRP; SK&F 110679) specifically stimulates GH release in man. To determine the effect of a continuous GHRP infusion and whether response attenuation occurs in man, we administered to six healthy subjects a 6-h infusion of saline and three doses of GHRP, each followed by a 1.0 micrograms/kg bolus injection. GH was measured every 10 min using an immunoradiometric assay. During the saline infusion, spontaneous GH peaks occurred at variable times in four of the six subjects. During the continuous GHRP infusion, a single burst of GH release occurred with the two lower doses (0.1 and 0.3 micrograms/kg.h). With the highest dose of 1.0 micrograms/kg.h, a primary burst of GH release was followed by sporadic secretory episodes of lesser magnitude during the infusion; the GH concentrations remained above baseline before administration of the iv GHRP bolus in all six subjects. The mass of GH secreted was indirectly determined using waveform-independent deconvolution analysis. Mean GH secretion rates (micrograms per L distribution volume/h) were calculated by dividing the GH mass by the time interval. The GH secretion rates during the infusion period (0900-1430 h) were 2.40 +/- 0.68, 2.47 +/- 0.61, 7.67 +/- 1.86, and 14.75 +/- 2.32 on the saline and GHRP (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 micrograms/kg.h) infusion days, respectively (P less than 0.05, 1.0 micrograms/kg.h vs. saline). The GH secretion rates after the iv GHRP bolus were 18.28 +/- 3.81, 19.01 +/- 2.03, 11.70 +/- 2.55, and 7.86 +/- 0.80 on the saline and GHRP (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 micrograms/kg.h) infusion days, respectively (P less than 0.05, 1.0 micrograms/kg.h vs. saline). Compared with the saline infusion, the GH response to GHRP infusions was dose dependent (r = 0.81; P less than 0.001). The GH response to the iv bolus was inversely related to the dose of the preceding 5.5-h continuous GHRP infusion (r = -0.58; P = 0.003), and the total amount of GH secreted (constant infusion plus the bolus infusion periods) was not different among the GHRP doses. Constant GHRP infusion stimulates GH release in man, and partial response attenuation occurs with a subsequent 1.0 micrograms/kg GHRP bolus. We hypothesize that GHRP is active at multiple sites and may act as a functional somatostatin antagonist. Further studies are needed to better determine the site(s) of GHRP action and its potential use as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent.\r"

No change in the mean daily plasma OT concentration was observed with advancing gestational age; there was a change in the pattern of plasma OT secretion throughout the period, however. About 21 days from delivery (150.8 +/- 1.8 days gestational age), plasma OT levels showed occasional fluctuations, distributed throughout the day. About 8 days from delivery (163.2 +/- 2.4 days gestational age), a clear circadian pattern of OT was detected, with an acrophase at 2200 h. These results suggest that there is a relationship between the pattern of OT secretion and advancing pregnancy. This may account partially for the increase in uterine activity known to occur in term rhesus monkeys.\r"

Rec-hTSH caused a consistent and dose-related increase in thyroid monolayer cell cAMP release and human thyroglobulin (hTg) secretion, confirming its bioactivity. Repetitive studies (n = 5) allowed us to derive an estimated biopotency for the rec-hTSH preparation examined of 5.6 IU/mg compared to 10 IU/mg for commercially available bovine TSH for human use. The rec-hTSH had a bioimmune ratio of 0.55, similar to that of purified pituitary hTSH standards, Furthermore, rec-hTSH induced thyroid epithelial cell growth, as evidenced by a decrease in thyroid cell doubling time from 54 +/- 2.1 to 31 +/- 1.7 h (P less than 0.005). Hence, rec-hTSH is a potent glycoprotein hormone preparation when measured in a homologous human thyroid cell culture system. Rec-hTSH could serve as a future definitive International Standard and has the potential for a useful diagnostic and therapeutic reagent.\r"

MA-10 cells were used as a bioassay system to follow the characterization and purification of the active principle in the conditioned medium of human Sertoli cells. The Leydig cell stimulatory factor is a thermo-labile and trypsin-sensitive protein retained onto 10,000 mol wt (MW) cut-off filters. The following scheme was used to purify the active protein: concentration by ammonium sulfate (80%) precipitation, followed by dialysis using molecularporous membrane tubing of MW cut-off 12,000-14,000, heparin-agarose, Concanavalin-A-Sepharose, and immobilized reactive textile dye affinity chromatography. Yellow 86 and green 19 dyes immobilized on agarose matrix were used. This procedure resulted in the rapid (less than 24-h) purification of a 79,000 +/- 6,082 (n = 3; under denaturating conditions) MW protein which stimulated Leydig cell steroid biosynthesis 25-fold at picomolar concentrations. The MW of the biologically active protein was further confirmed to be around 80,000 by gel filtration chromatography. This 80,000 MW human Sertoli cell-secreted protein (hSCSP-80) was shown to be different from human transferrin, human serum albumin, and rat testibumin. hSCSP-80, by modulating Leydig cell steroid biosynthesis, may play a significant role in the regulation of testicular function.\r"

At the same time, EGFR mRNA levels were examined in three groups by dot and Northern blot analyses. Binding studies were performed using 125I-labeled human EGF as a ligand, and two classes (high and low) of binding sites were found in all specimens. Although dissociation constants (Kd) were not significantly different among three groups, the number of binding sites was significantly decreased in IUGR and DM placentas compared to that in the AGA group. Total cellular RNA was isolated from a part of the placentas used for binding studies using the guanidinium CsCl method, denatured, and dot blotted onto nitrocellulose filter. Poly(A)+ RNA was selected from the total RNA, electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel, and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Then, hybridization with 32P-labeled pE7 (a cDNA of EGFR), autoradiography, and densitometry were performed. The amounts of mRNA hybridized with pE7 were reduced in IUGR and DM placentas compared to that in the AGA group. The molecular sizes of EGFR mRNA were 10 and 5.6 kilobases in all three groups. These results suggest possible physiological actions of EGF on adequate feto-placental growth and development in human pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Two circulating GH-binding proteins (GH-BP), one of which is related to the GH receptor, have been described. To assess their possible role in or link with determining statural growth, we measured their activity/level in the serum of 25 adult subjects from a short-statured population from the highlands of Papua New Guinea (Mountain Ok people, similar in stature to African pygmies) and in 25 normal-statured North American control subjects. The Mountain Ok people have normal levels of GH, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF-II, and serum albumin and prealbumin in association with short stature, making them a unique study population. Levels of the high affinity (GH receptor-related) GH-BP were significantly lower in the Mountain Ok subjects than in the taller controls (5.2 +/- 3.0% vs. 10.6 +/- 3.9% GH bound/160 microL, respectively; mean +/- SD; P less than 0.001). In contrast, the low affinity GH-BP was comparable in Mountain Ok and control subjects. Because of the structural similarity between the GH receptor and GH-BP, these data suggest that a limitation in GH receptor/GH-BP endowment may be associated with short stature despite normal circulating IGF-I levels. Alternatively, it is possible that the GH-BP itself plays an important role in growth promotion. Thus, the GH receptor (and/or GH-BP) complement may be a determinant of the genetically programmed height achieved.\r"

Group II patients had exogenous hormonal support. Serum relaxin (RLX), GH, PRL, estradiol (E2), and progesterone levels were measured weekly by RIA from weeks 4-8 of pregnancy. Analysis of variance and covariance were used to determine hormonal relationships. Serum RLX was present in the natural pregnancy group, with a mean of 1.94 micrograms/L over the study period. Serum RLX was undetectable in the POF patients (less than 0.16 micrograms/L). No significant difference in PRL or progesterone levels between the two groups was noted. E2 levels showed an upward trend in both groups with time and were significantly higher in patients of the POF group than in group I women (P = 0.001). GH levels were significantly higher in the natural cycle patients (P = 0.02) despite lower E2 levels. These data provide additional support for the concept that RLX production in early pregnancy originates from the corpus luteum. They suggest that a luteal product, probably RLX, stimulates GH secretion in early pregnancy. This is a previously undescribed role for RLX in pituitary physiology during human pregnancy.\r"

SRIH, at 10(-7) M concentration, inhibited basal thy incorporation (maximally by 4 h lasting for up 24 h), which effect was greater in goiter than in normal thyroid and was also detected in growing adherent epithelial cells. Moreover, in a follicle suspension SRIH prevented TSH-stimulated thy incorporation, both in normal and in goitrous thyroid. Basal expression of c-myc RNA was not affected by SRIH in either tissue, whereas the TSH-stimulated c-myc RNA level was significantly reduced in goiter. No effect of SRIH was observed on basal or TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin RNA levels. SRIH did not alter basal cAMP concentrations in normal or goitrous follicles, but it significantly reduced TSH-stimulated cAMP accumulation both in normal thyroid and in goiter. Overall, our data indicate a direct inhibitory action of SRIH on growth, but not on differentiation, of human thyroid, probably by a mechanism not entirely cAMP dependent.\r"

  ".W": "The assessment of vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) in the anterio-posterior projection has become widely used in the management and prevention of osteoporosis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the presence of spinal osteophytes has a major impact on measured BMD in men, thus casting doubt on the value of these BMD measurements. We have assessed the impact of osteophytic and aortic calcification on spinal and femoral BMD measurements in 130 normal postmenopausal women, aged 45-71 yr. Lateral lumbar spine radiographs were obtained in all subjects and graded separately (0-3) for osteophytes and aortic calcification. Both forms of calcification increased with age, and BMD of all sites was correlated positively with body weight and negatively with age. The correlation coefficients between BMD and calcification scores were nonsignificant. Multiple regression analysis, including weight, age, and calcification scores, demonstrated a small but significant effect of osteophyte score on lumbar BMD (partial r2 = 0.04; P = 0.012) and a similar trend for Ward's triangle and the trochanteric region (partial r2 = 0.02; P less than 0.06). The aortic calcification score remained nonsignificant. It is concluded that the influence of spinal osteophytes on lumbar BMD in postmenopausal women is substantially less than that in men and is, therefore, unlikely to interfere with BMD estimation in most subjects. The relationship between proximal femoral BMD and osteophyte score suggests a real relationship between skeletal density and degenerative joint disease, as has been demonstrated by others.\r"

Rescreening the library using D1 as a probe led to the full-length cDNA being cloned and sequenced which has the potential to encode a 572-amino acid polypeptide. This would correspond to a 63-kDa nonglycosylated protein which is probably membrane bound. The recombinant fusion protein from the original D1 clone was recognized in dot blot or Western blot assays by 4 of 19 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 3 of 9 patients with Graves' disease, and 1 of 6 patients with idiopathic myxedema; all other sera (12), including that from normal subjects, were negative. Clone affinity-purified autoantibodies bound to a protein of 64 kDa in a Western blot of human thyroid tissue. Using D1 as a probe in a Northern blot revealed 3.9-kilobase (kb) transcripts in poly(A)+ RNA from normal human thyroid and extraocular muscle, but not skeletal muscle. The dog equivalent of D1 cDNA was isolated by screening 10(6) plaque-forming units from a dog thyroid cDNA library using clone D1. A fragment of dog cDNA was, in turn, used as a probe in a Northern blot of dog poly(A)+ RNAs from thyroid, brain, lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, and stomach; a faint signal at 3.9 kb was observed in all tissues except the thyroid, which displayed a strong transcript of 2.6 kb. It is concluded that the D1 cDNA clone encodes an autoantigen shared by the thyroid and eye muscle. Its possible relevance to autoimmune ophthalmopathy is discussed.\r"

A deficiency of CRH in patients with seasonal affective disorder could contribute to the characteristic lethargy, hypersomnia, and hyperphagia characteristic of this illness. To test this hypothesis, we studied basal plasma ACTH and cortisol levels and their responses to ovine CRH in controls and depressed patients with seasonal affective disorder before and after light treatment. Untreated seasonal affective disorder patients showed normal basal plasma cortisol and ACTH levels, but their responses to CRH tended to be delayed and were significantly reduced. When patients were studied after 9 days of light treatment, a significant increase in plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to CRH was observed. Our findings in untreated patients with seasonal affective disorder are similar to those in patients with Cushing's disease 2 weeks after transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, who uniformly show sustained suppression of their CRH neuron because of long-standing hypercortisolism. This findings suggest that the CRH neuron of patients with seasonal affective disorder is hypofunctional. We postulate that the clinical symptomatology in patients with seasonal affective disorder could reflect deficient activity of this important arousal-producing system.\r"

To assess this, 12 normal subjects randomly received 2 hypoglycemic clamp studies in which the only variable was the insulin dose (0.6 or 5.0 mU/kg-min). Despite 10-fold differences in circulating insulin (265 +/- 29 vs 2576 +/- 222 pmol/L respectively), the hypoglycemic stimulus did not vary. Glucose levels fell over one hour, and then were maintained for two hours at the same hypoglycemic plateau (approximately 3.1 mmol/L for each study) by a variable glucose infusion. Although basal counterregulatory hormone levels in low and high dose studies were indistinguishable, during hypoglycemia the response of epinephrine, growth hormone, and glucagon was significantly suppressed when the degree of hyperinsulinemia was increased. We conclude that raising the magnitude of hyperinsulinemia suppresses the magnitude of the counterregulatory hormone response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects. This modulating effect of insulin per se is yet another variable in the interpretation of hypoglycemic counterregulation.\r"

Using physiological concentrations of TSH (less than 100 mU/L), a marked increase in the level of TSHR mRNA was observed within 12 hours and reached a greater than 1000% increase after 24 hours exposure. At high TSH concentrations (greater than 1000 mU/L), this increase in TSHR-specific mRNA was markedly reduced. However, at no time were basal TSHR mRNA levels suppressed even with 100 U/L of TSH for 48 hours. These observations demonstrate ligand-induced up-regulation of the human TSHR mRNA by physiologically relevant concentrations of TSH.\r"

  ".W": "Cetirizine, a derivative of hydroxyzine, is a new compound with potent antihistaminic property without antiserotonin and anticholinergic activities. The effect of both a single dose (15 mg) and 7 days of treatment (15 mg twice daily) with cetirizine, a potent H1 antagonist on bronchoconstriction induced by histamine and leukotriene D4 (LTD4) has been examined in 10 patients with mild atopic asthma in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. Cetirizine, after a single dose and 7 days of treatment with placebo, the geometric mean values of the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (millimolars) were 1.60 (95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 3.11) and 1.67 (0.77 to 3.65), compared with 118.07 (77.22 to 180.54) (p less than 0.0001) and 53.16 (20.50 to 137.84) after cetirizine administration (p less than 0.0002). The mean inhibition after a single dose was twofold higher than after 1 week of treatment (p less than 0.05). After a single dose and 7 days of treatment with placebo, the geometric mean values of the provocative concentration of LTD4 causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (micromolars) were 2.26 (1.74 to 2.94) and 2.37 (1.77 to 3.17), compared with 3.90 (2.60 to 5.86) (p less than 0.05) and 3.21 (2.28 to 4.52) after cetirizine administration. This result suggests that cetirizine is a potent H1 antagonist in the human airways. Diminished activity after 1 week of treatment suggests subsensitivity of H1 receptors developing in human airways. The small protective effect after a single dose against LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction indicates a nonspecific rather than a specific receptor antagonism.\r"

In four experimental systems, TB+ number decreased in the absence of HR (1) in basophils from atopic subjects stimulated by allergen concentrations below the threshold for HR, (2) in basophils sensitized by anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl IgE stimulated by noncovalently linked 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-human serum albumin (also, the threshold for decrease of TB+ required lower concentrations of sensitizing anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl IgE than for HR), (3) in low Ca++ medium, and (4) in the presence of the Na+/H+ exchanger, monensin. These results suggest that (1) there is a lower threshold for TB+ decrease than for HR in allergen concentration, number of membrane IgE molecules, and number of IgE cross-linkings; moreover, external Ca++ requirement is lower for decrease of TB+ than for HR and (2) TB+ decrease reflects either granule exocytosis or, in the absence of HR, biochemical changes (most probably cation exchanges) altering the interaction of the basic dye with the granules. Thus, monitoring decrease in TB+ allows detection of basophil activation in the absence of HR.\r"

Sensitization to egg, as indicated by a positive skin test or RAST, was found in 5% of 1-year-old babies, but none of the babies in this series fulfilled the clinical criteria for immediate-type milk allergy. For both bovine casein (CAS) and egg albumin, the IgG response was largely restricted to IgG1 in contrast to the predominant IgG4 response to these antigens that is found in adults. The level of IgG4, but not IgG1, antibody to CAS and ovalbumin (OV) was lower in some of the babies compared with that of their mothers (N = 166; p less than 0.05, Student's paired t test). However, there was no difference in the total serum IgG subclass levels between mothers and babies. These results demonstrate that, in the population of babies studied, (1) type I hypersensitivity to egg occurred in 5% of 1-year-old babies, (2) the predominant IgG subclass of antibodies to CAS and OV in babies is IgG1, and (3) in the 22% of babies, there was substantially (greater than 1000-fold) less IgG4 antibody to CAS and OV than in their mothers, suggesting specific exclusion of some IgG4 antibodies.\r"

ECs and pulmonary monocytes were isolated from the bronchial mucosa and pulmonary parenchyma of subjects undergoing lobectomy for standard clinical reasons. Circulating autologous T cells were rigorously depleted of accessory cells to the extent that they lost the capacity to respond to mitogenic lectins alone. ECs restored mitogen-induced DNA synthesis and DNA synthesis triggered by CD3 cross-linking in T cells, as did pulmonary macrophages, and this was unrelated to HLA-DR expression. The ability of promoting T cell proliferation after CD3 cross-linking was, in part, due to the secretory products of ECs, since their supernatants were also effective. Interferon-gamma-treated ECs were capable of presenting antigens to autologous T cells. This was an HLA-DR-restricted phenomenon, but EC efficiency in this system was less than 40% of efficiency demonstrated by pulmonary monocytes. However, ECs greatly upregulated antigen-specific responses supported by pulmonary monocytes.\r"

  ".W": "We have used double-color fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis to characterize the homotypic aggregation response of human eosinophils (EOs). With this method, we demonstrate for the first time that EOs are able to form stable aggregates. The aggregation response induced by the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), was low and was not primed by platelet-activating factor (PAF). In contrast, the aggregation response induced by opsonized particles was markedly enhanced after priming with PAF. Additional experiments with several blocking monoclonal antibodies indicate that the CR3 receptor present on human EOs mediates the homotypic aggregation induced by PMA and by small opsonized particles through a putative \"cell-adhesion\" site on CR3, which binds to its counter structure on the opposing cell. The signal that initiates this binding event is generated after PMA addition or activation of the iC3b-binding site and is not sensitive for priming by PAF. The priming by PAF of the aggregation response induced by opsonized particles is restricted to an action on the iC3b-binding site, possibly by enhancing the affinity for its ligand.\r"

Twenty-one subjects (14 children and seven adults) received cat IT and 11 subjects (six children and five adults) received dog IT. Bronchial challenges with allergen and histamine were performed once a year. Specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG4 were measured, and skin prick tests were done in connection with the challenges. Allergen sensitivity decreased significantly in both treated groups (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05 in the cat-allergen and dog-allergen treated groups, respectively). Bronchial hyperreactivity measured by the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% decrease in peak expiratory flow in the cat-allergen treated patients (p less than 0.001) but not in the dog-allergen treated patients. Skin sensitivity decreased in both groups (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05), whereas specific IgE increased initially but dropped to the pretreatment level during the second year. Specific IgG1 and IgG4 increased during the first and second year in the cat-allergen treated group (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001), whereas only IgG4 increased in the dog-allergen treated group (p less than 0.01). Five cat-allergen treated children and one of the adults who completed 3 years of therapy had mild systemic reactions. We conclude that cat IT ameliorated bronchial allergen sensitivity and bronchial hyperreactivity and resulted in an adequate antibody response. Dog IT was less efficacious but led to attenuation of bronchial allergen sensitivity.\r"

The C terminal portion of CD23 is released to the serum as soluble Fc epsilon R II (sFc epsilon R II), which may be involved in regulation of IgE synthesis. We studied sFc epsilon R II levels in normal children and in patients with immunodeficiencies, including common variable immunodeficiency (CVI), partial DiGeorge syndrome, and immunodeficiency associated with ectodermal dysplasia to examine the relationship of sFc epsilon R II levels to B cell numbers and other immunoparameters. Serum Fc epsilon R II levels are higher in younger children (younger than 3 years) and decline gradually with age. In 11 patients with CVI with normal numbers of B cells (greater than 6%), sFc epsilon R II levels were comparable to that of control subjects. Five patients with CVI with deficiencies of peripheral B cells had levels of sFc epsilon R II similar to levels of control subjects. In all but one patient with partial DiGeorge syndrome, sFc epsilon R II levels were not significantly elevated, despite the presence of elevated peripheral B cell numbers. Of six patients with ectodermal dysplasia, four demonstrated increased Fc epsilon R II levels, a finding not correlated with serum IgE levels or with peripheral eosinophil or B cell numbers.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a series of experiments to determine if anticholinergics induce immediate cutaneous wheal-and-flare responses in normal volunteers. We performed intradermal skin testing in seven healthy volunteers (three atopic and four nonatopic) with 20 nmol of atropine. All subjects had an immediate wheal-and-flare response to atropine. To determine if this cutaneous response was due to anticholinergics in general, skin testing was also performed to scopolamine and ipratropium. These agents also produced immediate wheal-and-flare responses in all subjects, but they less potent than atropine. Pretreatment with antihistamines equivalently inhibited wheal-and-flare responses to both histamine and atropine, indicating a possible mast cell role. The potential role of M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes was evaluated by use of the selective antagonists, pirenzepine (M1), 11[[2-1[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]-acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AFDX-116) (M2), and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) (M3). Cutaneous wheal responses induced by pirenzepine and 4-DAMP were relatively equivalent and larger than responses induced by AFDX-116 at doses less than 200 nmol. At 200 nmol, all three muscarinic receptor subtype antagonists induced equivalent wheal formation. We then compared the cutaneous wheal responses to these specific muscarinic receptor antagonists based on their relative affinity for their respective muscarinic receptor subtype. This comparison suggested that M1 or M2, but not M3, muscarinic receptor subtypes may be important in anticholinergic-induced cutaneous wheal-and-flare responses. We propose that there may be an M1 or M2 muscarinic autoreceptor that inhibits the release of acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Monthly therapy with high-dose IVIG resulted in a threefold decrease in both maintenance oral corticosteroid dose and in extra oral corticosteroids needed for control of exacerbations of asthma. This was accompanied by significant improvements in peak expiratory flow rates and in symptom-score rating. An immunomodulatory effect of IVIG was suggested by the changes in immediate skin test reactivity. Seven of the eight patients demonstrated one or more reactions to a panel of allergens before therapy. During the course of the trial, there was a progressive diminution in skin test reactivity with a 100-fold reduction in sensitivity at the completion of 6 months of therapy. In this preliminary study, the reduction in steroid requirements, improvement in symptoms and peak flow measurements, and diminution in immediate skin test reactivity support a potential role for IVIG in the treatment of severe steroid-dependent asthma. A larger, randomized trial now appears warranted.\r"

In seven sensitive subjects, continuous challenge with pollen Ag consistently induced release of more major basic protein (MBP) and eosinophil-derived neutrophil (EDN) than did B solution. Low levels of both MBP and EDN were observed during the first hour with increased accumulation during the second to fifth hour. Comparison of Ag- versus B-challenged site responses in individual subjects demonstrated significantly higher levels of both MBP and EDN at Ag than at B sites during the second to fifth hour. Levels of both MBP and EDN in the second to fifth hour correlated significantly with histamine release in the same sites in the first hour (r = 0.66 and 0.83, respectively). Imprints of the skin bases of the chambers after 5 hours demonstrated variable numbers of EOS at the Ag-challenged sites and only occasional EOS at the B-challenged sites; most cells on the skin bases were neutrophils. However, immunofluorescence localization of MBP in biopsy specimens of the blister bases revealed striking extra cellular MBP deposition. These findings indicate that EOS components accumulate in vivo in IgE-mediated human skin reactions, even when prominent EOS accumulation is not visualized, possibly because the EOS are degranulated in the allergic-reaction site. Release of EOS components in these reactions may be linked to earlier mast cell activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eleven patients demonstrated a dual asthmatic response. A significant decrease in the provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 was found from a geometric mean starting value of 1.18 mg/ml on the control day to 0.24 mg/ml (p less than 0.001) and to 0.17 mg/ml (p less than 0.001) 3 and 24 hours after allergen challenge. A significant correlation was observed between the increased BHR at 3 hours and the magnitude of the late response (r = -0.57; p less than 0.05). Nedocromil sodium (6 mg) significantly inhibited the increase in BHR, 1 mg/ml (p less than 0.001) at 3 hours and 0.50 mg/ml (p less than 0.001) at 24 hours. Nedocromil sodium shifted the severity of the early allergic reaction (EAR) from mean -34.8% to -6.9% and inhibited the later allergic reaction (LAR) from -30.5% to +0.4% (p less than 0.005). From the study can be concluded that nedocromil sodium inhibits the EAR and LAR and the allergen-induced increase in BHR. The inhibitory effect of nedocromil sodium on the LAR may be related to its ability to inhibit the increased BHR before the development of the LAR.\r"

In this study, the expression pattern of BALB/c class I genes has been analyzed in adult bone marrow and fetal liver. cDNA libraries were synthesized from these tissues, and isolated class I cDNA clones were characterized by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes and by nucleotide sequence analysis. Of the 29 total class Ib genes, transcripts of five including Q6d, Q7d, T9c, T10c, and the 37 gene were isolated from the bone marrow cDNA library. Four of these can encode proteins; the sequence of the T10c gene demonstrates it is most likely a pseudogene. A non-overlapping set of three class Ib cDNA clones was obtained from the fetal liver, including T13c, the Thy 19.4 gene, and a previously uncharacterized class I gene provisionally designated as FL 57.2. Although the majority of H-2Dd cDNA clones that were analyzed lack introns, many of the class Ib cDNA clones contain intron sequences. This suggests that the expression of some of these genes may be regulated at the level of RNA splicing. The T13c gene encodes the thymus leukemia Ag in BALB/c mice. We have confirmed that the T13c gene is expressed in fetal liver by flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with anti-TL mAb.\r"

  ".W": "Engagement of the surface Ig receptor with anti-IgM antibodies stimulates murine B lymphocytes to markedly increase their expression of the cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and LFA-1. Stimulated B cells display increased homotypic adhesiveness and form spontaneous heterotypic conjugates with T lymphocytes. This latter T-B cell interaction is further enhanced if T cells have been previously activated with phorbol esters. In all cases, the formation of cell-cell conjugates is dependent on LFA-1-ICAM-1-mediated interactions as assessed in mAb blocking experiments. B lymphocytes stimulated with anti-IgM display a marked increase in binding to ICAM-1-transfected L cells. This cell-cell interaction is inhibited by anti-LFA-1 mAb binding to the B lymphocyte. Together, these results demonstrate that there is an induction of both ICAM-1 and LFA-1 on stimulated B cells and a corresponding increase in the adhesiveness of these cells. These findings suggest that Ag binding to the surface Ig receptor could prepare a B lymphocyte for subsequent interaction with a T lymphocyte. This provides insight into how efficient T-B collaboration may occur between very infrequent Ag-specific lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "CD4+ and CD8+ T cells do not develop significant lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity when PBL are cultured with IL-2 or even when they are activated with a T cell stimulus such as OKT3 mAb. The possibility that a T cell regulatory mechanism prevents the development of LAK activity by CD4+ or CD8+ cells in OKT3 mAb and IL-2 cultures was tested by depleting CD8+ or CD4+ cells from PBL before stimulation with OKT3 and IL-2. Under these conditions, the remaining CD4+ and CD8+ cells were able to generate non-MHC-restricted lysis of NK-resistant tumor targets. Our data suggested that a regulatory signal was present in the culture to prevent the development of lytic function by T cells. T cells removed from the PBL cultures were, upon culture with IL-2, able to generate high LAK activity, suggesting that inhibition of the CD4+ or CD8+ T cell-mediated LAK activity was an active ongoing process, which blocked the lysis at the level of the activated cell and not the precursor cell. Mixing experiments demonstrated that the CD4+ or the CD8+ cells isolated from the PBL cultures were able to inhibit the development of lytic function in the CD4-depleted and CD8-depleted cultures. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been shown to block LAK activity of NK cells in IL-2-stimulated cultures. When TGF-beta was added to CD4(+)- or CD8(+)-depleted cultures, it also inhibited LAK activity of T cells in a dose-dependent fashion, without interfering with T cell growth. Lytic activity returned to activated levels when TGF-beta was removed from the culture medium, thereby demonstrating the reversibility of TGF-beta inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta) on activation-induced CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and gene expression was investigated. TGF-beta was demonstrated to inhibit pore-forming protein (PFP) mRNA expression and total benzoyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester esterase activity in CD8+ T cells cultured with IL-2 and OKT3 mAb for 6 to 18 days. Consistently, in the absence or presence of TGF-beta, the PFP mRNA expression and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity of CD8+ T cells were closely correlated. The inhibitory effects of TGF-beta on both CD8+ T cell PFP mRNA expression and LAK activity were reversible by removal of TGF-beta from the culture. Expression of lymphokines, adhesion/recognition molecules, and activated p55 IL-2R, previously implicated in the lytic mechanism of cytotoxic lymphocytes, either was not detectable or did not correlate with TGF-beta inhibition of LAK activity. In addition, independently of effector/target cell binding, the lectin- or heteroconjugated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of IL-2/OKT3 mAb-activated CD8+ T cells was inhibited by preculture with TGF-beta. TGF-beta also inhibited the rapid activation-induced expression of PFP mRNA and cytotoxic potential in resting T cells, thereby indicating that the effect of TGF-beta was independent of T cell proliferation. TGF-beta inhibition of CD8+ T cell PFP mRNA expression and cytotoxic potential was TGF-beta dose dependent; however, a variety of activation stimuli (including IL-2, IL-6, and OKT3 mAb) were all similarly inhibited by TGF-beta. Therefore, TGF-beta may be an important general regulator of CD8+ T cell cytotoxic function, in particular by suppressing expression of PFP, a major cytolytic protein implicated in the lytic function of cytotoxic lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The association of various surface molecules with the cytoskeleton in resting peripheral blood T cells was examined by assaying the capacity of detergent to solubilize them. Cytoskeletal association was assessed by staining T cells with a fluorescein-conjugated mAb, resuspending the cells in buffer with or without the nonionic detergent, NP-40, and determining the capacity of the detergent to remove the mAb from the cell surface by using flow microfluorimetry. MAb to CD3, the TCR, and CD45 were completely removed from the cell surface by detergent. In contrast, 7 to 50% of mAb to CD2, CD4, CD8, CD11a/CD18, CD44, and class I MHC molecules were resistant to detergent solubilization, demonstrating that a fraction of these molecules was constitutively associated with the cytoskeleton. The effect of cross-linking these molecules with a mAb and a secondary goat anti-mouse Ig was also examined. Cross-linking CD3 or the TCR induced cytoskeletal association of these molecules. In addition, cross-linking increased the fraction of CD2, CD4, CD8, CD11a/CD18, CD44, and class I MHC molecules that was associated with the cytoskeleton. In contrast, cross-linking CD45 did not induce an association with the cytoskeleton. The effect of T cell activation on the cytoskeletal association of these molecules was also examined. Stimulation of T cells with ionomycin and PMA greatly increased the expression of CD2 and CD44 without increasing the number of molecules associated with the cytoskeleton. Stimulation with PMA alone had no effect on the expression of CD2 or CD44, but was found to decrease the percentage of these molecules associated with the cytoskeleton. Stimulation with ionomycin and PMA increased both the expression of class I MHC molecules and the number of molecules associated with the cytoskeleton proportionally. Finally, stimulation with ionomycin and PMA decreased CD3 expression, but increased the number of CD3 molecules associated with the cytoskeleton. The data establish a pattern of cytoskeletal association of T cell-surface molecules that is a characteristic of each individual molecule and can be altered by cross-linking. Moreover, the results indicate that the association of various T cell surface molecules with the cytoskeleton is a dynamic process that varies with the state of activation and or differentiation of the cells.\r"

Secretion can be induced by treating CTL with the combination of a phorbol ester to activate protein kinase C and ionomycin to increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by ion-selective permeabilization of both the plasma membrane and internal Ca2+ storage depots. Treatment of cloned murine CTL with PMA induced a change in cell shape without movement of cytoplasmic granules, whereas increased intracellular [Ca2+] after treatment with ionomycin resulted in granule movement without shape change. Granule movement induced by ionomycin did not lead to secretion in the absence of PMA. Direct activation of the TCR resulted in increased intracellular Ca2+ predominately from influx of extracellular Ca2+ with a substantially smaller contribution from release of Ca2+ from internal stores. By independently inhibiting either component of the TCR-initiated increase in intracellular Ca2+, it was determined that both sources of Ca2+ were required for granule movement and secretion. Thus, increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration mediated by these two sources appear not to be functionally equivalent. Taken together, these results indicate that the CTL functional response that normally occurs after interaction with an antigenically relevant target cell is regulated by three independent signals.\r"

  ".W": "Protein kinases are considered likely to play important roles in the still dimly understood process by which mitogens induce resting T lymphocytes to enter the cell cycle. Using two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of lysates from orthophosphate-labeled cells, we have compared patterns of phosphorylation in freshly isolated murine splenic T cells exposed to three mitogenic agents: antibody to the epsilon-chain of the TCR CD3 complex, the plant lectin Con A, and a mixture of PMA and ionomycin, which together bypass the signal transduction apparatus to activate intracellular pathways. Of 14 phosphoproteins found whose level of phosphorylation was increased (at least fivefold) by anti-CD3 epsilon antibody, 13 also responded to the mixture of PMA and ionomycin. Surprisingly, however, only 5 of these 14 also responded strongly to Con A exposure. We also identified two substrates that were phosphorylated in response to Con A but not to anti-CD3. Phosphorylation patterns were also studied in T cells exposed to either PMA or ionomycin alone, to gain further insight into the role of protein kinase C and calcium-dependent events in the activation process. Of 16 phosphoproteins that responded to mixtures of PMA and ionomycin, 4 were shown to require the ionomycin signal, 2 to require the PMA signal, and 3 others to respond only when both activators were present; the other 7 responded to either agonist added alone. In addition, we found two PMA-sensitive phosphoproteins in which phosphorylation was inhibited by ionomycin induced calcium signals. Finally, we identified several phosphoproteins which show differential responsiveness in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Classification of kinase substrates based on their differential susceptibility to these stimuli should provide new insights into the mode of action of agents and diseases that affect T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Immunosuppressive effects of low levels of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation on cutaneous immune responses have been attributed to deleterious effects of UVB radiation on epidermal Langerhans cells (LC). To determine how UVB radiation modulates LC function we examined the effect of in vitro UVB exposure on LC accessory cell activity and surface phenotype. Exposure of BALB/c murine epidermal cells to low dose (less than or equal to 200 J/m2) UVB radiation in vitro inhibited their ability to support the mitogenic response of unstimulated, accessory cell-depleted splenic T cells to anti-CD3 mAb. LC accessory cell activity was also inhibited when LC were exposed to UVB radiation in situ, although several-fold higher doses of UVB radiation were required to achieve complete inhibition of LC function. This dose-dependent inhibition was mediated through a direct effect on LC that could not be reversed by IL-1 or IL-6 alone or in combination, or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. TNF-alpha did not inhibit LC accessory cell function in this assay and anti-TNF-alpha neutralizing antibodies did not reverse the inhibitory effects of UVB radiation. UVB irradiated LC failed to participate in the anti-CD3-dependent clustering that normally occurs between T cells and LC during the proliferative response of murine T cells to anti-CD3 mAb, suggesting that UV radiation may interfere with accessory cell function by preventing intercellular adhesion. Two-color flow cytometric studies revealed low levels of the ICAM-1 on freshly isolated LC and some keratinocytes. ICAM-1 expression on LC increased 15 to 20-fold within the first 24 h in vitro and continued to increase during a 72-h culture period. The integrin LFA-1 was not identified on freshly isolated or cultured LC but was detected on responding T cells. Prior exposure of LC to UVB radiation (50 or 100 J/m2) inhibited the increase in ICAM-1 expression that normally occurs in vitro by up to 70% whereas surface levels of class II MHC Ag, CD45 and Fc-gamma receptors were not affected. Blocking studies revealed that anti-CD3 induced T cell proliferation and T cell-LC cluster formation was inhibited by both anti-LFA-1 and anti-ICAM-1 mAb suggesting that ICAM-1 expressed on LC must bind to LFA-1 on T cells to facilitate proliferative responses of T cells to anti-CD3 mAb. We conclude that the in vitro inhibitory effects of low dose UVB radiation on LC accessory function may result because UVB radiation prevents upregulation of ICAM-1 expression by LC in culture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We now report studies that identify some of the synovial cells and cytokines responsible for local GM-CSF production and gene expression in RA. GM-CSF was assayed by ELISA in supernatants from cultured RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes stimulated with various cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, macrophage-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and TGF-beta). Immunoreactive GM-CSF was detected in IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha-stimulated cultures, but not in cells cultured in medium or stimulated with any of the other cytokines. IL-1 and TNF-alpha had a synergistic effect on GM-CSF production. GM-CSF gene expression by fibroblast-like synoviocytes was analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay, Northern blot analysis, and in situ hybridization. Both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha induced GM-CSF mRNA accumulation, with a maximum effect after 4 h of stimulation. We then studied GM-CSF production by macrophage-like synoviocytes (MLS) isolated from fresh synovial specimens by flow microfluorimetry. Fresh MLS spontaneously secreted the cytokine and exogenous IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha had no effect. After 1 wk in culture, additional stimulation with IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha was required for GM-CSF production. Finally, in situ hybridization performed on freshly isolated subpopulations of synovial cells, identified GM-CSF RNA transcripts in MLS.\r"

  ".W": "To define further the molecular basis for abnormal interactions of cord blood or neonatal neutrophils with endothelial cells in vitro, we studied neutrophil adhesion and migration under experimental conditions specifically designed to evaluate CD18-independent mechanisms. Unstimulated cord blood neutrophils of healthy term neonates demonstrated significantly diminished adhesion to IL-1-stimulated endothelial cell monolayers under conditions of shear stress (congruent to 1.85 dynes/cm2); overall levels of migration by neonatal cells were also significantly diminished, although the adherent subpopulation of these cells migrated relatively normally. A mAb (DREG-56) against the human homologue of the murine MEL-14 antigen (termed lectin-, epidermal growth factor-, complement binding domain-cell adhesion molecule-1 (LECAM-1), a member of the LEC-CAM family of adhesion molecules) markedly inhibited adhesion of healthy adult but not cord blood neutrophils. In additional assessments of endothelial cell adhesion or migration in the absence of shear forces, cord blood neutrophils demonstrated significantly diminished values compared to adult controls. Moreover, mAb DREG-56 significantly diminished adhesion of healthy adult but not cord blood suspensions in the presence or absence of the anti-CD18 mAb R15.7. Immunofluorescence assessments of unstimulated cord blood neutrophils or neutrophils of neonates 12 to 48 h of age showed dramatically diminished levels of surface LECAM-1 compared to adult neutrophils. Chemotactic stimuli (FMLP, 10 nM, 15 min) consistently \"down-regulated\" surface LECAM-1 on adult neutrophils to levels approximately 10% of unstimulated suspensions and comparable to those of most unstimulated neonatal suspensions. Moreover, FMLP stimuli elicited little or no down-regulation of LECAM-1 on neonatal cells. In comparative studies, endothelial cell adhesion of unstimulated cord blood or adult control neutrophils (assessed under conditions of flow) was directly related to levels of neutrophil surface LECAM-1. Although FMLP stimulation significantly diminished both adhesion and LECAM-1 surface levels of adult control cells, the adhesion and LECAM-1 expression observed with cord blood cells were not significantly influenced by this stimulus. The mechanisms underlying diminished LECAM-1 expression and LECAM-1-dependent adhesion of neonatal neutrophils and the physiologic significance of these abnormalities deserve investigation.\r"

This study analyzes Amb a I, a family of related proteins formerly known as Ag E, that comprise the major allergens of short ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia). T cells isolated from ragweed allergic patients were shown to proliferate in response to purified Amb a I.1 protein from pollen in in vitro secondary cultures, demonstrating the presence of T cell stimulatory epitopes in Amb a I.1. Three recombinant forms of Amb a I (Amb a I.1, Amb a I.2, and Amb a I.3) obtained as cDNA derived from pollen mRNA were expressed in bacteria. All three recombinant forms were shown to be specifically recognized by pooled ragweed-allergic human IgE on immunoblots, confirming these gene products are important allergens. An examination of immunoblots probed with sera derived from allergic patients revealed a variation in IgE binding specificity. A minority of patients' IgE exclusively reacted with recombinant Amb a I.1, whereas most patients' IgE reacted with Amb a I.1 as well as Amb a I.2 and Amb a I.3 proteins. A detailed examination of the reactivity of T cells derived from 12 allergic patients to these recombinant Amb a I forms revealed that these allergens are all capable of stimulating T cell proliferation in in vitro assays. It is concluded that the allergic response to ragweed pollen in most allergic patients is composed of a reaction to multiple related Amb a I proteins at both the B and T cell levels.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable evidence supports the idea that autoantibody production in human and murine SLE is Ag driven. To determine whether Ag (the ribosomal P proteins) could initiate autoantibody production in lupus mice, 34 MRL/lpr mice were immunized with mouse riboosomal proteins in Freund's adjuvant. Neither intact ribosomes, denatured total mouse ribosomal proteins, nor the purified mouse ribosomal proteins, P1 and P2, induced the production of anti-P autoantibodies in the MRL/lpr mice. In contrast to these negative findings, MRL/lpr mice immunized with Artemia salina ribosomes produced anti-P antibodies as well as anti-P autoantibodies. Although the induced anti-P autoantibodies bound exclusively to the carboxyl terminus, these anti-P antibodies differed from spontaneously occurring anti-P autoantibodies in their predominant binding to mouse P0 on immunoblots and their preferential reactivity against A. salina synthetic peptides by ELISA. Induction of anti-P antibodies required the presence of P1 and P2 on the ribosome because ribosomal cores devoid of P1 and P2 dimers did not induce anti-P. Despite the presence of approximately 80 ribosomal proteins, autoantibodies to other mouse ribosomal proteins were rarely observed. Immunization of MRL/+ mice and a normal H-2-matched strain of mice, C3H, also resulted in anti-P antibodies reactive with the A. salina P proteins and mouse P0. Whereas anti-P levels gradually declined in C3H mice, anti-P levels either remained elevated (MRL/lpr) or showed a secondary rise (MRL/+) at the onset of autoimmunity. These observations indicate that: i) high levels of autologous Ag are not sufficient to drive antiribosomal autoantibody production in MRL mice, ii) multivalency of the P proteins may explain their potent immunogenicity and ability to break tolerance, and iii) immunized MRL mice show an abnormal persistence of high level anti-P production presumably reflecting T cell activation of presensitized B cells.\r"

  ".W": "Several reports implicate Langerhans cells of skin as susceptible targets, reservoirs, and vectors for transmission of HIV: 1) numbers of Langerhans cells in skin of HIV-infected patients were decreased about 50% of that in control skin; 2) as many as 30% of Langerhans cells in the skin of HIV-infected patients were morphologically abnormal; 3) viral particles typical for HIV were identified in or around 2 to 5% of these cells; and 4) infectious HIV was isolated from skin biopsies of infected patients. These results were consistent with similar observations of HIV-infected macrophages in such tissues as brain, lung, and lymph node. Despite these findings, other investigators find no evidence for virus infection in the epidermis of HIV-infected patients by any of several immunohistochemical or ultrastructural criteria. To address this controversy, we obtained skin from 28 HIV-seropositive subjects at various clinical stages by full thickness biopsy or suction blister. Samples were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy for presence of HIV virions, by immunofluorescent staining for viral proteins, by in situ hybridization for HIV-specific mRNA, by polymerase chain reaction amplification of virus-specific DNA, and by direct virus isolation by coculture of epidermis onto monocyte target cells. By any of these techniques, demonstration of HIV in the epidermis of infected patients was equivocal and even then, infrequent. In contrast, viral DNA was detected from the dermis of the same skin samples (26 of 28 samples). Moreover, the number and morphology of Langerhans cells in skin of infected patients were within normal limits, regardless of stage of disease. These studies in toto suggest that a role for Langerhans cells as a principal viral reservoir or vector of transmission is highly unlikely.\r"

However, this hormone action may be susceptible to significant modification by other agents from the endocrine, nervous, or immune systems. To investigate the nature of this neuroimmunoendocrine interaction, the present study examined the impact of hormones, neurotransmitters, and lymphokines on basal and androgen-induced SC production by lacrimal gland acinar cells in vitro. Our results demonstrated that vasoactive intestinal peptide, the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, PGE2, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha significantly increased media SC levels in control or androgen-containing cell cultures. In contrast, the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, significantly decreased cellular SC output. These effects may be mediated through the agents' known capacity to alter intracellular cAMP levels. In support of this hypothesis, exposure of acinar cells to stimulators or analogues of cAMP resulted in a significant enhancement of SC production. Thus, these findings indicate that SC output in lacrimal tissue may be modulated by interactions between the endocrine, nervous and immune systems.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven (nine CD4+ and two CD8+) protein purified derivative-specific and eight tetanus toxoid-specific T cell clones (TCC), established from the peripheral blood of healthy persons, were cocultured in vitro with irradiated mononuclear cells from patients infected by HIV in the presence of PHA and polybrene. Two weeks post-HIV exposure, all 17 CD4+, but neither of the two CD8+, TCC exhibited integration of HIV in their genoma, as detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis, and released HIV into their supernatants, as detected by measuring both reverse transcriptase activity and p24 Ag. When co-cultured with either autologous or allogeneic B cells, all CD4+ HIV-infected TCC induced the synthesis of extraordinarily high amounts of IgM, IgG, and IgA. In contrast, their noninfected counterparts could provide helper function for Ig synthesis by autologous B cells only in the presence of the specific Ag (or anti-CD3 antibody), and induced allogeneic B cells to synthesize Ig only upon stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody. The supernatants of HIV-infected TCC failed to stimulate Ig synthesis in B cells. More importantly, when HIV-infected clonal T blasts and B cells were cultured in different chambers separated by a millipore membrane, permeable to molecules but not to cells, Ig synthesis did not occur. The Ig synthesis induced by HIV-infected TCC was also markedly inhibited by the addition in culture of either anti-CD4 or anti-LFA-1 antibody. In contrast, HIV-infected TCC maintained their ability to provide helper function for Ig synthesis in the absence of any stimulus, even after fixation with p-formaldehyde. These data demonstrate that in vitro infection with HIV enables human T cells to stimulate Ig synthesis by B cells by an Ag-nonspecific, MHC-unrestricted, contact-dependent mechanism. This may explain, at least in part, the hypergammaglobulinemia and other phenomena related to polyclonal B cell activation frequently seen in HIV-infected persons.\r"

The mechanism(s) by which eosinophils, as opposed to neutrophils, accumulate at inflammatory sites is unknown. One possible mechanism would be an eosinophil-specific pathway of adhesion to vascular endothelium. In this study we have demonstrated that human eosinophils, but not neutrophils, constitutively express alpha 4 beta 1 (CD49d/CD29). Expression was not increased on low density eosinophils or normal density cells stimulated with platelet-activating factor. Eosinophils, but not neutrophils, specifically adhered to COS cells transfected with vascular adhesion molecule-1 in a alpha 4 beta 1-dependent manner. Eosinophil, but not neutrophil, adhesion to IL-1 stimulated human umbilical vascular endothelial cells was significantly inhibited by alpha 4 beta 1 mAb at both 5 h (p less than 0.05) and 20 h (p less than 0.001). Inhibition of both resting and platelet-activating factor-(10(-7) M) stimulated eosinophil adhesion was observed. We conclude that the alpha 4 beta 1/vascular adhesion molecule-1 adhesion pathway may be involved in specific eosinophil, as opposed to neutrophil, migration into sites of eosinophilic inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator with a long duration of action. CGRP is widely distributed and is present in perivascular nerves of tissues that include skin and the synovium. In this study we have investigated the possibility that CGRP can modulate the inflammatory actions of the cytokine IL-1 by using an inflammatory model in rabbit skin. The intradermal injection of IL-1 (1.4 x 10(-14) mol/site) alone stimulated little edema formation. However, when IL-1 was injected with CGRP (10(-11) mol/site), a highly significant edema was observed, and neutrophil accumulation induced by IL-1 was potentiated. These results suggest that the action of IL-1 as a potent mediator of increased microvascular permeability is only observed when skin blood flow is increased in this model. This was confirmed by experiments in which PGE2 (3 x 10(-9) mol/site) at a dose with a similar duration of vasodilator action as CGRP (10(-11) mol/site) also potentiated edema induced by IL-1. Further experiments investigated the mechanism by which IL-1 increased microvascular permeability. Edema induced by IL-1 was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and the presence of circulating neutrophils. However, selective platelet-activating factor and histamine H1 antagonists had no inhibitory effect on this response. Thus it appears that when a microvascular bed is dilated by the long-lasting vasodilator CGRP, edema induced by IL-1 is clearly observed. These results highlight a potentially important synergistic interaction between cytokines and neuropeptides in inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "The T cell-derived lymphokine, IL-4, inhibits production of IL-1 beta by normal human monocytes. To determine whether IL-4 suppresses IL-1 expression by a transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional mechanism, we evaluated the half-life of LPS-induced IL-1 beta message and transcriptional rate of the pro-IL-1 beta gene in human monocytes after treatment with IL-4. Although the initial steady-state IL-1 mRNA levels in control and IL-4-treated monocytes were comparable during the first 2 h after stimulation with LPS, IL-1 message levels subsequently decreased at a significantly greater rate in the IL-4-treated cells. Thus, IL-4 did not prevent the initial expression of IL-1 message, but did accelerate down-regulation of IL-1 mRNA in LPS-stimulated monocytes. The initial 2 to 3 h lag period may be necessary for production of a protein(s) that mediates this inhibitory effect because treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, blocked the marked reduction of IL-1 message levels induced by IL-4. Nuclear run-on analyses demonstrated that IL-4 decreases IL-1 mRNA levels, in part, by repressing IL-1 gene transcription. Furthermore, mRNA half-life studies showed that IL-4 also significantly increases the rate of IL-1 message turnover in these cells. Together, these findings demonstrate that IL-4 inhibits IL-1 production in human monocytes by suppressing the formation of new IL-1 transcripts as well as by decreasing IL-1 message stability. In addition, the kinetics of inhibition and the fact that cycloheximide blocks this process suggest that IL-4 induces or enhances synthesis of a protein(s) that mediates these effects.\r"

These TGF-beta moieties also bidirectionally regulated the IL-6 production of rIL-1-stimulated fibroblasts. The addition of TGF-beta to cultures in which fibroblasts were vigorously stimulated with rIL-1 resulted in an inhibition of fibroblast IL-6 production and mRNA accumulation. In contrast, the addition of TGF-beta to cultures in which fibroblasts were incubated with suboptimal concentrations of rIL-1 resulted in a synergistic increase in IL-6 production and mRNA accumulation [corrected]. Nuclear run-on analysis demonstrated that IL-6 gene [corrected] transcription was synergistically augmented when rTGF-beta 1 was combined with suboptimal concentrations of rIL-1. These studies demonstrate that TGF-beta stimulates fibroblast IL-6 production. They also show that TGF-beta can augment or inhibit the IL-6 production of IL-1-stimulated fibroblasts. Lastly, [corrected] they demonstrate that the stimulatory effects of TGF-beta are, at least partially, mediated by alterations in IL-6 gene transcription.

  ".W": "Experimentally, TNF-alpha can mediate the hemorrhagic necrosis of certain tumors. Furthermore, evidence indicates that natural cytotoxic (NC) activity, a cell-mediated cytolytic activity that utilizes TNF-alpha in the lysis of target cells, is involved in preventing the outgrowth of certain NC/TNF-alpha-sensitive tumor cells. These observations raise the issue of whether soluble TNF-alpha normally serves as a tumor surveillance mechanism preventing the outgrowth of some tumors. To address this issue, we have used TNF-alpha to select TNF-alpha-resistant variants from the NC/TNF-alpha-sensitive mouse fibroblast cell line 10ME. Previously, we have demonstrated that 10ME is tumorigenic in immune-deficient mice but fails to form tumors in normal mice. Moreover, selection of NC-resistant variants from 10ME selects for both TNF-alpha resistance and tumorigenicity in normal mice. As cells that have been selected for NC resistance form tumors in normal mice, whereas the NC-sensitive parental cell line does not, it seems that escape from NC activity is sufficient to significantly increase the tumorigenic potential of the cell line. We show that the selection with TNF-alpha, although associated with NC resistance, does not increase the tumorigenic potential of 10ME cells but reduces it. Thus, NC activity appears to function as a mechanism to prevent tumor formation, and escape from NC activity allows for tumor formation; TNF-alpha does not have similar activity. Moreover, this suggests that NC activity is not equivalent to soluble TNF-alpha activity, but utilizes TNF-alpha more efficiently than soluble TNF-alpha, or NC activity involves both TNF-alpha and other effector mechanisms.\r"

Using specific neutralizing antibodies, both factors were shown to be involved in autocrine and/or paracrine regulation of B cell differentiation. IgG induced by SAC/IL-2 stimulation was reduced 73% with an anti-IL-6 antibody and 40% with an anti-TNF-alpha antibody. Similar effects of these antibodies were observed on the spontaneous in vitro IgG production by lymphoblastic B cells from six patients with hypergammaglobulinemia. Kinetic studies with SAC/IL-2-activated B cells revealed that the anti-TNF-alpha antibody must be present at the beginning of the culture to exert an effect on Ig production, whereas the anti-IL-6 antibody reduced Ig production even if added as late as day 3. This sequential action of TNF-alpha and IL-6 on B cell differentiation was reflected by different kinetics of release of these two cytokines into the supernatant of SAC/IL-2 activated B cells; TNF-alpha peaked at 24 h and IL-6 at 96 h after stimulation. In addition, it was shown that IL-6 production by in vitro-activated B cells was partially blocked by an anti-TNF-alpha antibody suggesting that TNF-alpha regulates IL-6 production in normal B cells via an autocrine pathway. We also investigated the effects of TGF-beta on TNF-alpha and IL-6 production by normal B cells. Although TGF-beta inhibited Ig production by in vitro-activated and in vivo-activated B cells, it did not inhibit the release of these cytokines from normal B cells. Furthermore, TGF-beta did not inhibit the induction of nuclear factor-IL-6 nor the expression of IL-6R on activated B cells. Thus, although the biologic effects of anti-IL-6 and TGF-beta on B cell Ig production are similar, their mechanisms of actions appear to be distinct.\r"

Here we report that IL-8, a novel cytokine produced by a variety of cells in vitro in response to stimulation with bacterial LPS and the proinflammatory cytokines, appears in the circulation of primates in vivo during septic shock, sublethal endotoxemia, and after the administration of IL-1 alpha. The magnitude of the IL-8 response correlates with the severity of the insult, and levels of IL-8 peak relatively late, after those of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, and simultaneously with those of IL-6. IL-8 has been primarily defined as a selective activator and chemoattractant of neutrophils, and we demonstrate that after LPS or IL-1 alpha infusion, circulating neutrophil numbers rapidly recover from an initial neutropenia while IL-8 concentrations are maximal, supporting the hypothesis that IL-8 influences circulating leukocyte populations in vivo. We conclude that IL-8 is another participant in the cytokine cascade elicited by sepsis and inflammation and, as such, may play a significant role in host defense and disease.\r"

Physicochemical characteristics of those activities obtained by HPLC gel filtration and HPLC chromatofocusing were very similar to those of human NAP-1 and MCP-1, suggesting that rabbit spleen cells produce NAP-1 and MCP-1 after Con A stimulation. A cDNA library was constructed from mRNA purified from Con A-stimulated rabbit spleen cells and screened with oligonucleotide probes. By two rounds of screening, NAP-1 and MCP-1 cDNA were cloned. NAP-1 cDNA comprises 1500 bp with an open reading frame that encodes for a 101-amino acid protein highly similar to human NAP-1. MCP-1 cDNA comprises 607 bp with an open reading frame that encodes for a 124-amino acid protein highly similar to human MCP-1. Expression of NAP-1 and MCP-1 mRNA by rabbit spleen cells was studied. Both Con A- and LPS-stimulated spleen cells expressed NAP-1 and MCP-1 mRNA, but the kinetics of expression were different. Con A rapidly induced high NAP-1 and MCP-1 mRNA expression. LPS also rapidly induced NAP-1 mRNA expression, but high MCP-1 mRNA expression was not observed until 15 h after stimulation. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled NAP-1 and MCP-1 with anti-human NAP-1 or MCP-1 polyclonal antibodies was attempted. Immunoprecipitated rabbit NAP-1 with a molecular mass of about 7 kDa was detected by SDS-PAGE and radioautography, but MCP-1 was not. Cloned rabbit NAP-1 and MCP-1 will give us opportunities to study the role of NAP-1 and MCP-1 in vivo.\r"

Bovine lymphocytes from the prefemoral lymph node of a heifer immunized with mAb 1E11 were fused with SP-2/0, a nonsecreting murine cell-line. Two bovine x murine hybridomas secreting bovine monoclonal anti-Id specific for the Id of 1E11 were stabilized. These anti-Id inhibited the binding of 1E11 to purified glycoprotein gI in a dose-dependent fashion. Naive mice immunized with the anti-Id produced anti-anti-Id (Ab3) that reacted with BHV-1 glycoprotein gI in a RIA, and neutralized BHV-1 infection in vitro. The Ab3 also showed reactivity to the 74K subunit of authentic gI glycoprotein in a Western blot analysis, and to the synthetic peptide bearing the 1E11 epitope in a RIA.

It was found that the disappearance of complexes formed by I-Ed and the hen egg lysozyme 107-116 peptide is twice as rapid on the surface of live, as compared to glutaraldehyde-fixed APC. Moreover, the addition of peptides with a high affinity for I-Ed could reduce the half-life of Ag-class II complexes on either live or fixed APC. The same effect was detectable using purified class II molecules adhered on plastic microtiter wells, and even in the case of complexes formed in vitro between radiolabeled Ag and purified class II molecules. This effect of accelerated dissociation appeared to be specific because only I-Ed binding peptides were able to accelerate the dissociation of the hen egg lysozyme 107-116/I-Ed complex either on the surface of cells or in purified form in solution, and high affinity I-Ed binders did not affect the half-life of purified OVA 323-339/I-Ad complexes. These results demonstrate that free ligand can influence the kinetics of dissociation of class II-peptide complexes, and therefore suggest that a mechanism other than the classical first order kinetics may be involved in this process.\r"

  ".W": "Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the 45 pocket of HLA-A2.1 to determine the potential role of this structurally defined feature of class I molecules in viral peptide and alloantigen presentation. The 45 pocket lies below the alpha 1-domain alpha-helix and is composed of five amino acids, three of which differ between HLA-A2.1 and HLA-B37. These two class I molecules have previously been shown to have largely non-overlapping peptide-binding specificities. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace the hydrophobic residues at positions 24, 45, and 67 in the 45 pocket of HLA-A2.1 with the hydrophilic amino acids found in these positions in HLA-B37. Thus, three single amino acid mutants were produced: 24A----S, 45 M----T, and 67V----S. These mutants were transfected into HMy2.C1R cells and assessed for their ability to present influenza virus matrix M1 57-68 peptide and HTLV-I Tax-1 2-25 peptide to HLA-A2.1-restricted, peptide-specific CTL and to present alloantigens to HLA-A2-allospecific CTL lines. Each of these substitutions in the 45 pocket produced a molecule that failed to present the M1 peptide to most M1 peptide-specific CTL lines. In contrast, none of these mutations affected presentation of the Tax-1 peptide to Tax-1-specific CTL lines, which indicates that these mutant HLA-A2 molecules can function in viral peptide presentation. Two of the three substitutions in the 45 pocket resulted in lack of recognition by a subset of HLA-A2 allospecific CTL lines. These results demonstrate that the amino acid side chains in the 45 pocket can strongly influence peptide presentation and suggest that the 45 pocket may play a role in determining peptide-binding specificity.\r"

Correlation of TCR-alpha and -beta-gene usage with these patterns of reactivity demonstrated that TCR gene usage was restricted within Ag reactivity groups. In particular, V-J junctional regions (CDR3 equivalent) were restricted with conserved junctional amino acid motifs present in both TCR-alpha- and -beta-chains. Comparison of TCR gene usage in hybrids expressing identical V alpha and V beta gene segments but demonstrating different patterns of reactivity revealed that changes in either J alpha and/or J beta gene segment usage could alter antigenic reactivity. Indeed, single or limited amino acid differences within the CDR3 region were sufficient to markedly alter fine specificity. These data demonstrate the critical role for CDR3 in determining antigenic reactivity in beef insulin-reactive hybrids and are compatible with the current model of TCR/peptide/MHC interaction.\r"

  ".U": "91225496\r", 
  ".W": "In the 2H3 subline of rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3), IgE receptor cross-linking stimulates a signal transduction pathway that leads to the secretion of histamine, serotonin, and other inflammatory mediators; the assembly of F-actin; and the transformation of the cell surface from a microvillous to a lamellar or ruffled architecture. We report here that 20 h incubation of RBL-2H3 cells with 10 microM lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase), inhibits both the secretory and morphologic responses to IgE receptor cross-linking. Ag-induced Ca2+ mobilization, determined from the influx and efflux of 45Ca2+, and Ag-induced 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate production are also inhibited in lovastatin-treated RBL-2H3 cells. Under the same conditions, lovastatin does not alter cell proliferation or IgE receptor expression, and it causes only a small impairment of responses initiated by drugs that bypass the earliest steps in the receptor-activated transduction pathway (ionomycin-induced secretion and PMA-induced membrane ruffling). Receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, secretion, and ruffling are all restored by 0.5- to 4-h incubation of lovastatin-treated cells with mevalonic acid, the product of HMG CoA reductase and the first committed intermediate of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. In contrast, dolichol and cholesterol, which are synthesized from products of the isoprenoid pathway, do not restore receptor-activated responses. These data implicate an isoprenoid pathway intermediate in an early step in the IgE receptor-activated signal-transduction sequence. We postulate that this intermediate is required for a newly described post-translational modification of proteins, their post-synthetic isoprenylation. The substrates for this modification include the ras family of GTP-binding proteins and the gamma subunits of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein.\r"

  ".W": "Lipid chemoattractants, such as platelet-activating factor and leukotriene B4, as well as the peptide chemoattractant FMLP, were found to stimulate [3H]phosphatidic acid ([3H]PA) formation in 1-O-[3H]octadecyl-lyso platelet-activating factor-labeled rabbit neutrophils. The stimulation of [3H]PA formation appears to result from the activation of phospholipase D (PLD), because in the presence of ethanol, chemoattractant stimulation produced [3H]phosphatidylethanol, the characteristic compound produced by PLD at the expense of [3H]PA formation. The PLD activation by all chemoattractants tested was primed by cytochalasin B and revealed a similar time dependence. However, lipid chemoattractants were less potent as compared with FMLP, and the maximal stimulation by the former was lower than that by the latter. From these results, it is concluded that the mechanism of PLD activation by lipid chemoattractants is similar to, but different from, that by FMLP. Cytochalasin B stimulated degranulation and [3H]PA formation in agonist-stimulated neutrophils, and their stimulations were well correlated. Ethanol inhibited both agonist-stimulated [3H]PA formation and degranulation in a concentration-dependent manner, but the inhibition in degranulation was much less than that in [3H]PA formation. These results suggest that PLD activation is involved in degranulation, but another signaling pathway may also be required for full stimulation of degranulation. When the radiolabeled neutrophils were stimulated by chemoattractants for 5 min, 1,2-[3H]diglyceride was found to accumulate. The accumulation was inhibited by either ethanol or the phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor propranolol, which indicates that PA produced by PLD can be converted to 1,2-diglyceride by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. Under these conditions, propranolol did not inhibit degranulation stimulated by chemoattractants. These results indicate that PA produced by PLD is more important than its metabolite diglyceride for the degranulation of rabbit neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "B lymphocytes have been shown to proliferate and release oxygen metabolites when surface Ig is cross-linked and when stimulated with phorbol ester. Biochemical evidence has been provided for the presence of a superoxide generating system in B cells, which seems to be identical to the well-characterized NADPH-oxidase of phagocytes. In this report, we show that normal and EBV-transformed B cells produce superoxide anions after stimulation with phorbol ester and when surface Ig was cross-linked, as detected by lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence. Anti-surface IgG antibodies induced a significant respiratory burst whereas those directed against surface IgM had no effect on B cell oxidative metabolism. Prestimulated B lymphocytes responded to further triggering by the same or another ligand. Pretreatment with Staphlococcus aureus Cowan I strain (SAC) or anti-IgM antibodies resulted in complete unresponsiveness to subsequent SAC or anti-IgG stimulation, but it did not affect PMA- and ionomycin-mediated B cell chemiluminescence. In contrast to preincubation with anti-IgM antibodies, the pretreatment of B cells with SAC induced a transient inhibitory effect on B cell signaling. In fact, SAC-pretreated B lymphocytes could be restimulated with the same ligand when blast cells were isolated. Furthermore, a 24-h incubation of the pretreated B cells in the absence of SAC completely restored the SAC-mediated respiratory burst. These results suggest that two distinct mechanisms may account for SAC- and anti-IgM-induced inhibition: a transient and reversible modulation of surface Ig, induced by SAC, and a long-lasting desensitization of the surface Ig receptors, respectively. These findings may have interesting implications for understanding the transduction of negative signals in B lymphocytes.\r"

  ".U": "91225500\r", 
  ".W": "C receptor CR3 (iC3b-receptor, CD11b/CD18) plays an essential role in several phagocytic and adhesive neutrophil functions. Recent evidence suggests that stimulus-induced phosphorylation of the CR3 beta-chain, CD18, may mediate certain neutrophil functions by transiently converting the molecule to an activated state. Staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor that blocks PMA-induced CD18 phosphorylation, was used to study the functional relevance of this event. Neutrophils adhered to glass were assayed for binding and phagocytosis of iC3b-opsonized sheep E (EC3bi) in the presence or absence of PMA and/or staurosporine. Binding of EC3bi was markedly increased, not only by PMA, but also by staurosporine and by a combination of both agents (three- to sevenfold). The enhancement of rosetting by staurosporine was likely caused by increased surface expression of CR3 via exocytosis of specific granular contents. In contrast, staurosporine alone did not stimulate phagocytosis of EC3bi and markedly inhibited PMA-induced phagocytosis. Staurosporine also inhibited phagocytosis of yeast beta glucan particles, a CR3 ligand that, in contrast to EC3bi, is bound and ingested without additional prior treatment with PMA. beta glucan phagocytosis was associated with a low level of CD18 phosphorylation. Staurosporine did not block phagocytosis in general, because this agent had relatively little effect on FcR-mediated phagocytosis. These data demonstrate that phagocytosis mediated by CR3 requires activation of CR3 via a staurosporine-sensitive pathway. Increased binding of EC3bi, a function of increased surface expression of CR3, does not require activation of CR3 by such a pathway, confirming previous evidence for the independence of these two phenomena. A direct role for CD18 phosphorylation in the activation of CR3 for phagocytosis is consistent with these data.\r"

Antibodies with both reaginic and nonreaginic activity mediated RE upon passive transfer to adult rats that had been adoptively transfused with immune TDL 7 days earlier. In serum collected 28 days after a primary infection, the most important antibody was homocytotropic IgE. Native IgE produced by active infection was isolated from 28-day immune serum by salt precipitation and/or by sequential affinity chromatography. The murine mAb A2 and B5 (anti-rat IgE) were conjugated separately to Sepharose 4B affinity columns for affinity separations. IgE was shown to be pure by gel electrophoresis and Western blots and its m.w. was estimated at approximately 190,000. As little as 183 micrograms of purified IgE could induce RE after passive transfer to adult rats. The IgE was shown to be functional by PCA activity, Ag-binding on Western blots, and skin sensitization; the latter could be blocked by pretreatment with 1R162, a rat myeloma IgE. Monoclonal IgG of any isotype transferred in amounts up to 35 mg/rat could not transfer RE to rats previously transfused with TDL cells. Immune serum collected 3 mo after the primary infection contained insufficient IgE to transfer RE, but complex non-IgE fractions were protective. The data thus demonstrate that IgE is a functional Ig in the rat capable of mediating the rejection of challenge nematode infections of the gut in the absence of other specific Ig. Secondly, other Ig may also play a role, in particular, several weeks after the primary infection when specific IgE levels in serum have declined.\r"

  ".W": "The specific immune alterations associated with HSV recurrences are ill defined although it appears that alterations in cell-mediated immune mechanisms are more likely associated with recurrent disease than humoral immunity. Immunization with HSV glycoproteins B and D (gBgD) after primary HSV infection has reportedly reduced the frequency of recurrences but the mechanisms remain unidentified. We therefore evaluated the effects of immunization with cloned gBgD on selected cell-mediated immune responses and their relationship to recurrent disease by using the guinea pig model of genital HSV-2 infection. In two experiments, immunization with gBgD + CFA on days 21 and 42 after HSV-2 inoculation significantly decreased the number of subsequent recurrent lesion days observed whereas CFA alone had no effect. Immunization with gBgD + CFA increased the lymphoproliferative and in vitro IL-2 response to gBgD more than to whole HSV-2 Ag preparations. Peak responses were observed 2 wk after the second immunization. The HSV-specific cytolytic response was also persistently increased beginning 1 wk after the first immunization. Analysis including both untreated and gBgD-immunized animals revealed that recurrent lesion days were inversely correlated to the IL-2 response to whole HSV-2 Ag (p less than 0.0001), the IL-2 response to gBgD (p = 0.0004), and the HSV-specific cytolytic response (p = 0.005 and 0.003 in two experiments, respectively). When the untreated group was analyzed separately, only the IL-2 response to whole HSV-2 Ag correlated to recurrences (p = 0.007). HSV glycoprotein immunization may increase IL-2 or other cytokines secreted by HSV-sensitized T cells increasing critical immune responses, such as NK- or lymphokine-activated killer-mediated cytolysis, that could eliminate the reactivated virus before the development of clinically apparent lesions.\r"

When anti-HSV-2 activity of M-CSF was evaluated in guinea pigs by 6 daily injection (s.c.) of M-CSF at various doses (5 x 10(5) to 7 x 10(7) U/kg), we found 2 x 10(6) U/kg to be the optimum dose for protective efficacy against primary HSV-2 infection. Either at a lethal, 5 x 10(5) pfu, or sublethal 5 x 10(4) pfu of virus challenge, animals treated with the optimum regimen of M-CSF exhibited lower herpetic lesion scores (p less than 0.005), and lower mortality (p less than 0.025) than animals in placebo group. M-CSF treatment increased the HSV-infected cell killing activities of plastic-adherent mononuclear cells, indicating that in vivo administration of M-CSF may activate the antiviral effects of guinea pig macrophages that may play a role in protection against severity and mortality of herpetic disease.\r"

Animals were immunized with the hybrid protein reconstituted into mannan-derivative-coated liposomes (gag-env-lipo). In vitro sensitization with a HTLV-1-positive cell line, TARS-1, of spleen cells obtained from these animals generated killer cells specific for syngeneic HTLV-1-positive cells. No killer activity was generated when spleen cells were obtained from animals immunized with the hybrid protein alone, the liposome alone, or the hybrid protein reconstituted into conventional liposomes with no polysaccharide coating. Killer cells were CD8+ CTL restricted to MHC class I. Analysis of CD8+ and CD4+ subsets in spleens showed the existence of primed CD8+ T cells in animals immunized with gag-env-lipo. Rats immunized with gag-env-lipo displayed accelerated rejection of TARS-1 but not of two other HTLV-1-negative tumor lines. Injection of carrageenan into animals strongly inhibited generation of killer cells, which indicates the necessity of macrophages for priming of CD8+ T cells with gag-env-lipo. Injection of carrageenan also cancelled in vivo immunity against HTLV-1+ cells induced with gag-env-lipo. These results, taken together, indicate that exogenous protein reconstituted into appropriate liposomes can effectively prime MHC class I restricted CD8+ T cells in vivo with macrophage dependency.\r"

  ".W": "Modification of cellular proteins via phosphorylation is known to be a major regulatory mechanism whereby external stimuli control intracellular events. We demonstrated that bacterial LPS induced a distinct set of phosphorylated protein (pp) in murine peritoneal macrophages, and that the LPS-induced pp were specifically located in cytosol and/or membrane fractions. One of the most heavily phosphorylated substrate proteins with a molecular mass of 65 kDa (pp65) was purified to homogeneity via SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography by sequential chromatography on Sephacryl S-200, HPLC anion exchange, and hydroxyapatite HPLC. Our pp65 is apparently the first purified LPS-induced pp, and is thought to be a novel protein. Serine residues on pp65 were found to be exclusively phosphorylated, indicating a contribution by LPS-inducible serine kinase. Interestingly, LPS-induced phosphorylation of pp65 was not observed in macrophages from a LPS-nonresponsive C3H/HeJ strain of mice, although their macrophages had about the same amounts of unphosphorylated p65 as normal macrophages when detected under Western blot analysis by using polyclonal anti-pp65 antibodies. This suggests that the functional defect of C3H/HeJ macrophages exists somewhere in the process before the pp65 phosphorylation. Moreover, the degree of the pp65 phosphorylation in macrophages stimulated with LPS or lipd A correlated well to that of cellular responses such as IL-1 production in the same macrophages. Considering these observations, the pp65 seems to play a crucial role in macrophage activation, and the studies on the structure and function of the pp65 should lead to progress in our understanding of the mechanisms of macrophage activation by LPS.\r"

We have identified the chromosomal sequences encoding the Ly-6A.2 molecule using very stringent hybridization and washing conditions. We confirmed that this gene encoded the Ly-6A.2 molecule by transfection studies using a cell line genetically negative for the Ly-6A.2 gene as a DNA recipient. Sequence analysis showed that the Ly-6A.2 gene is made up of four exons. The start site of transcription was determined by primer extension analysis. The first exon does not contain protein coding sequences. The structure of the Ly-6A.2 gene supports previous speculation that various Ly-6 RNA can be generated by alternate splicing events. The Ly-6A.2 chromosomal gene is closely related to the previously characterized Ly-6C.1 chromosomal gene in the intron, exon, and 5' flanking regions. This analysis indicates that these genes have arisen as a consequence of gene duplication. Although endogenous Ly-6A.2 and Ly-6C genes are IFN responsive, only the latter contains a clearly identifiable IFN responsive element. A transfected Ly-6A.2 chromosomal gene that contains 3.9 kb of 5'-untranslated sequence is IFN responsive. However, a shorter chromosomal clone containing only 940 bp of 5' sequence is constitutively expressed in transfectants but does not respond to IFN.\r"

  ".W": "We used in situ hybridization to study Ig mRNA levels in murine peritoneal and splenic B cells. Ig mRNA production fell into three distinct groups: low, intermediate, and high. Splenic B cells primarily exhibited low levels characteristic of resting B cells or high Ig mRNA levels characteristic of plasma cells. In contrast, a significant fraction of peritoneal B cells exhibited intermediate Ig mRNA levels. Intermediate Ig mRNA was T cell dependent in that congenic nu/nu mice had far fewer peritoneal cells expressing the intermediate Ig message than their wild type counterparts. CD5+ CD11b+ IgMbright+ peritoneal B cells were found to be mainly responsible for the production of intermediate Ig mRNA levels. The peritoneal CD5- CD11b+ IgMbright+ \"sister\" B cell subpopulation contained a lower percentage of intermediate Ig mRNA-producing B cells. CD5-CD11b-IgMdull+ \"conventional\" B cells produced negligible levels of Ig mRNA, comparable to those of unfractionated splenic B cells. Northern analysis showed that the majority of Ig mRNA expressed in the peritoneum is of the membrane rather than the secreted form. Consistent with that result, in short-term culture, peritoneal cells showed markedly less Ig secretion than did spleen cells. These studies describe novel Ig mRNA expression by peritoneal B cells and emphasize that within the peritoneal cavity, B cells do not tend to become antibody-secreting cells.\r"

This study examined the ability of murine epidermal cells (EC) to present tumor-associated Ag for the induction of in vivo antitumor immunity. Murine epidermal cells were deleted of Thy-1-bearing cells, cultured in 50 U/ml granulocyte-macrophage-CSF for 14 to 18 h, and pulsed with tumor fragments (TF) derived from S1509a-fibrosarcoma cells. These TF-pulsed EC were injected s.c. into syngeneic recipients at weekly intervals for a total of three immunizations and challenged with viable S1509a tumor cells 1 wk after the last immunization. Control animals received TF-pulsed allogeneic EC or EC treated identically but not pulsed with TF. EC that were pulsed with tumor cell fragments were able to induce protective immunity to tumor growth in vivo and to immunize for a significant delayed-type hypersensitivity response to injected tumor cells. The induction of antitumor immunity with TF-pulsed EC was genetically restricted, and culture of EC in granulocyte-macrophage-CSF was required for development of significant immunity. Furthermore, deletion of I-A+ cells by antibody and complement-mediated lysis eliminated the generation of immunity. Thus, I-A+ epidermal cells are capable of presenting S1509a tumor Ag for the generation of protective antitumor immunity in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91225515\r", 
  ".W": "NK cells lyse certain tumor cell targets but the effector cell surface molecules responsible for this reactivity remain uncertain. The allotypic NK1.1 Ag is the most specific serologic marker on murine cells that display non-MHC-restricted cytolysis of tumor cell targets, but no function has been previously ascribed to this Ag. In this report, we demonstrate that, in the presence of a mAb specific for the NK1.1 Ag (mAb PK136), freshly isolated and IL-2-activated NK cells from C57BL/6 mice can be induced to lyse an otherwise resistant target cell, Daudi. This phenomenon is effector and mAb specific because NK cells derived from BALB/c mice do not express the NK1.1 Ag and cannot be triggered by mAb PK136. We demonstrate that IL-2 activated but not freshly isolated NK cells express the Ly-6 and VEA Ag, originally described as T cell activation Ag. Moreover, mAb specific for Ly-6 and VEA induce target cell lysis by IL-2 activated but not freshly isolated NK cells. These mAb effects are specific, concentration dependent, and display kinetics that are similar to spontaneous cytolysis of NK-sensitive targets. The Fc portion of the activating antibodies and only FcR bearing target cells participate in mAb-induced activation, consistent with the mechanism of redirected lysis. Finally, analysis of Daudi cells transfected with beta 2-microglobulin gene demonstrate that the expression of MHC class I Ag by the target cell does not affect its sensitivity to mAb-induced lysis by NK cells. These data demonstrate that the NK1.1 Ag is functionally active on both freshly isolated and IL-2-activated NK cells and that IL-2-activated NK cells possess additional pathways of specific stimulation.\r"

This activity was found to correlate with increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the tumor cells and was blocked by anti-ICAM-1 antibodies. Both IFN-gamma and TNF induced large increases in the ICAM-1 expression on both cell lines and increased the susceptibility of the tumor cells to monocyte-mediated killing. IFN-alpha and IL-1 beta, however, induced only small increases in ICAM-1 expression and enhanced the lysis of the A375 cells but not the HT-29 cells by monocytes. These differences may be the result of a higher basal expression of ICAM-1 found on the A375 cells when compared with the HT-29 cells. These data indicate that regulation of ICAM-1 expression on tumor cells can alter the vulnerability of these cells to lysis by monocytes.\r"

Gentamicin incorporated polymethyl-methacrylate beads were implanted, following surgical debridement and were removed two months later. Post-implantation alleviation of clinical symptoms: pain, periauricular tissue swelling, otorrhoea, eradication of pseudomonal infection (100 per cent) and substantially shortened hospitalization (4-15 days) were the salient results of this therapeutic modality. Three patients recovered. Two patients who died, one of sudden cardiac arrest and the other of paralytic ileus, 15 and 60 days post-operatively while the beads were still implanted, were symptomless. Recurrence was seen in one patient with early bead extrusion. Ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss (one patient) and external meatal stenosis were the main complications. IARS appears to offer an effective alternative to long-term systemic antibiotic administration for the eradication of NEO-pseudomonal infection in patients who are sensitive, develop resistance, or when quinolone medical treatment has failed or is contra-indicated.\r"

It is a strongly held belief by otolaryngologists whose practice dates back to the 1960's that the prevalence of CSOM in Maori children is gradually falling. Despite the obvious practical implications this change has not yet been documented. The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence of CSOM in two surveys conducted in 1978 and 1987 of children living in a North Island Maori community. A second aim was to examine the natural history of CSOM in these children. The raw data from the 1978 study were reviewed. Of 134 children aged 4-13, 12 had CSOM. In 1987 the same age group yielded 12 children out of 250 with CSOM. The prevalence of CSOM fell from 9 per cent to 4 per cent. The incidence of new perforations in 1987 was 1.3 per cent per child per year. It is concluded there has been a fall in the rate of CSOM, although otitis media remains a significant problem for these children. The probability of a perforation healing was influenced by whether or not the perforation had been observed before: at least 35 per cent of perforations seen for the first time healed, but none of the perforations seen on two occasions healed spontaneously. It was concluded that perforation of the eardrum can be managed conservatively at first.\r"

Hypothyroidism has been described as an aetiological factor but, to date, no controlled study has been published confirming this association. This prospective, controlled study compared thyroid function in 61 consecutive RO patients with an age and sex matched control group (n = 65) without laryngeal disease. Thyroid function was assessed by measuring serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3). Hypothyroidism was diagnosed when TSH was above normal with a T3 and T4 below the normal range. Four RO patients were hypothyroid at the time of diagnosis, compared to five of the control group. Six RO patients had past or present hypothyroidism compared to seven of the controls. One RO patient and two controls were euthyroid with marginally elevated TSH levels. Although the incidence of hypothyroidism in this group of Reinke's oedema patients is higher than expected in a normal population, it is similar to that in an age and sex matched control group, reflecting the prevalence of hypothyroidism in middle aged women. This study suggests that hypothyroidism is not an aetiological factor in the development of Reinke's oedema.\r"

Pulse oximetry is a useful adjunct to the clinical assessment of croup, but cannot be relied upon solely for monitoring these labile patients.\r"

W/H is an essential measurement, as it permits comparison of weight independent of the height of an individual. We here present a method of constructing W/H standards, illustrated by a material sample of 4438 healthy individuals, 20-80 years of age, living in the Uppsala County during the period 1964-1971. In setting standards of W/H, the 'normal' increase in weight during adulthood and the distribution skewness of weight are both shown to be important. This weight gain starts at about 40 years of age, and is completed at approximately 55 years of age. It can be regarded as a 'normal' pattern, but not necessarily the optimum healthy one. Using ordinary growth charts for weight and height, a simple means of expressing W/H in standard deviation scores is outlined. It is difficult to find a representative Swedish sample, owing to geographical and psychosocial differences, and also to the secular trend phenomenon. However, the mean values for weight and height obtained in the present study fall between the mean values of two other recently conducted Swedish studies.\r"

When maximal ST-depressions limited by symptoms increased from 0 to 4 mm or more, the percentage of patients with 'serious' coronary disease, defined as either triple vessel disease or left main stem stenosis, increased from 50% to 80% (P = 0.0001). The patients in the lowest third of physical work capacity showed only a slightly increased risk of serious disease. This tendency was abolished in patients who were using beta-blockers, whereas the relationship between ST-depression and disease was not affected by this medication. The probability of finding left main stem stenosis in a patient increased from 5 to 30% with increasing ST-depression: beta-blockers did not affect this relationship, but there was no additional predictive effect of implicating the level of physical work capacity. It is concluded that traditional electrocardiography during exercise is of value when selecting patients for angiography, but that the physical work level obtained during the test does not predict the degree of coronary pathology.\r"

Their cause of death could not be estimated on the basis of previous patient history, and their autopsy diagnoses were then related to the initial cardiac rhythm recorded at the scene. At autopsy, coronary heart disease was considered to have been the cause of death in 78% of the patients with ventricular fibrillation, in 43% of the patients with electromechanical dissociation (EMD), and in 60% of the patients in asystole. Cardiac tamponade or massive pulmonary embolism was the cause of death in 15 of the 28 patients with EMD who underwent autopsy. These findings support previously noted relationships between some causes of cardiac arrest and the initial cardiac rhythm, and also in prehospital cardiac arrest patients with unsuccessful resuscitation.\r"

After adjusting for other variables, including developmental stage, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was the only blood analysis which discriminated symptom-detected patients (high ESR) from survey-detected patients (low ESR). Survey-detected patients had a better short-term survival. In multivariate survival analyses leucocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase activity and ESR were significant prognostic factors, in addition to advanced stage and detection due to symptoms. We conclude that common blood analyses such as ESR provide supplementary information concerning low- and high-risk lung cancer patients.\r"

  ".W": "Nine patients with food-relieved hypoglycaemic symptoms, in whom insulinoma and other organic diseases presenting with hypoglycaemia had been ruled out, and nine matched controls, participated in the study. Subjects were studied during a 5-h controlled (Biostator) insulin-induced (1-2 mU kg-1 min-1) hypoglycaemic clamp. After 1 h of euglycaemia, we aimed to lower the glucose level in arterialized venous blood in a stepwise manner at 30-min intervals to 3.5, 3.0, and 2.0 mmol l-1, and to withhold these levels for a further 30 min. At euglycaemia and at the end of the latter steps, the visual reaction time and cognitive function (digit span, letter cancellation and trail making) were tested, together with recording symptoms and signs of hypoglycaemia. Counter-regulatory hormones were measured at 20-min intervals. In the patients, clinical signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia developed at median blood glucose levels of 2.6-2.8 and 2.8-3.1 mmol l-1, respectively. By contrast, the blood glucose levels were 0.4-0.8 mmol l-1 lower in control subjects (P less than 0.05). Similarly, the median threshold for deterioration of visual reaction time was 2.8 mmol l-1 in patients and 2.1 mmol l-1 in controls (P less than 0.01). A similar trend was observed for the results of the neuropsychological tests. Visual reaction time deteriorated in all subjects, whereas the cognitive function of some of the subjects in each group remained unchanged during hypoglycaemia. The glycaemic thresholds for release of cortisol, glucagon and growth hormone were significantly higher in patients (P less than 0.05), whereas the thresholds for catecholamine release showed no significant difference from controls. Despite the comparable glucose infusion rates required to sustain each of the hypoglycaemic levels in the two groups, the control subjects achieved lower glucose levels, suggesting that there is resistance to insulin or glucose in functional hypoglycaemia. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the existence of a higher threshold for symptoms and signs, as well as for deterioration of brain function, may explain every-day hypoglycaemic symptoms, despite normal glucose levels, in subjects with functional hypoglycaemia. However, the hypothesis should be tested further using a blinded approach, including euglycaemic control studies.\r"

The incidence of bleeding that necessitated hospital admission was 2.7% per year (95% confidence limits, 1.7-3.7%). The major source of bleeding was the alimentary tract, whereas no cases of intracranial bleeding were found. Various factors with potential effects on the bleeding risk were evaluated by multivariate statistical analysis, and the following independent risk factors were identified: age greater than 75 years and hypertension increased the bleeding risk by 10.5% and 4.5%, respectively. Each recorded prothrombin value significantly below the therapeutic range increased the bleeding risk by 3.9%, and each year of treatment increased the risk by 2.0%. These figures may be used to estimate the risk of major bleeding in an individual patient. Current treatment with thiazide diuretics was found to increase the bleeding risk by 5.2%. However, this observation requires further documentation and analysis. Although no lethal episodes of bleeding occurred, the developing field of indications for oral anticoagulant therapy should be considered on the basis of a continuous substantial risk of major bleeding.\r"

It was found that the change in skin temperature correlated significantly with the degree of improvement following both genuine and sham acupuncture. Fourteen patients with no decrease in skin temperature exhibited a significantly better response to acupuncture than 19 patients who showed a decrease in skin temperature (G II). In the former group, there was a 15% median improvement in exercise tolerance (G II 0%), a 67% improvement in anginal attack rate (G II 38%), and an 84% improvement in nitroglycerine consumption (G II 50%). A significant correlation was found between the duration of disease and the effect of acupuncture.

All had serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations in the normal range, despite a relatively severe anaemia. Half-life and plasma clearance of intravenously injected recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) were determined. The results indicate that the lack of compensatory increase in serum EPO to the anaemic stimulus is not due to increased catabolism, but to decreased synthesis of the renal hormone. Two patients were treated with rhEPO (Eprex). In marked contrast to untreated controls, both patients responded with vigorous reticulocytosis and normalization of haemoglobin levels while they were still in severe renal failure. These results are similar to our previous findings in patients with acute renal failure due to tubular necrosis. Under all three conditions the defective EPO synthesis is probably the dominant pathogenetic factor for the largely aregeneratory anaemia of prolonged cases, and for the sluggish restoration of red cell mass during recovery of renal function. It is concluded that defective synthesis of EPO is not only a permanent and irreversible feature of severe chronic renal failure, but that it is also present, usually in a transient and reversible form, in different types of acute renal failure.\r"

A loss of heterozygosity at this locus has previously been reported by Mathew et al. in pheochromocytoma patients, and our results were in agreement with that study.

  ".W": "A 77-year-old man presented with adrenocortical insufficiency, for which a cause could not be identified during life. Six weeks after the diagnosis, the patient died, while receiving adequate cortisol therapy, from a fulminant gastrointestinal bleeding. A pleural effusion, found shortly before death, later showed malignant lymphoid cells. At autopsy, a widely spread, diffuse, malignant B-cell lymphoma with destruction of, amongst others, both adrenals was found. The retroperitoneal, but not the peripheral lymph nodes were involved, thereby explaining failure of diagnosis while the patient was living. This is the first description of a diffuse B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with adrenocortical insufficiency. Potentially curable malignant invasion of the adrenals can present with adrenocortical insufficiency, and may thus justify imaging of the adrenals with sensitive techniques in elderly patients with unexplained primary adrenocortical insufficiency.\r"

The indolent nature and microbiologic characteristics of bacterial biofilm infections coupled with the morbidity of graft excision and extraanatomic bypass grafting prompted us to use in situ graft replacement in 15 patients admitted to the hospital with 17 infected graft segments at a mean (+/- SEM) time interval of 70 +/- 16 months after graft implantation (n = 6) or revision (n = 9). Since 1986, 17 grafts (14 aortofemoral, 2 axillofemoral, and 1 femoropopliteal) infected by bacterial biofilms have been treated. Signs on admission included femoral pseudoaneurysm (n = 7), perigraft abscess (n = 6), or graft-cutaneous sinus tract (n = 4). No patient exhibited septicemia. At operation graft incorporation was absent and Gram's stain of perigraft exudate showed polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no bacteria. Culture of explanted graft material isolated coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 12), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), and no growth (n = 2). All patients were successfully treated by a regimen that included parenteral antibiotics, removal of involved graft material, excision of inflamed perigraft tissue, and in situ replacement with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis. No deaths, graft thromboses, or deep wound infections occurred after operation. Recurrent graft infection did not develop during a follow-up interval that ranged from 5 to 50 months (mean, 21 months). Diagnosis of vascular prosthesis infection caused by bacterial biofilms can be based on signs at admission and operative findings. Complications of this perigraft infection can be eradicated by antibiotic administration, local debridement, and in situ graft replacement.\r"

Experiments were designed to study changes in endothelial and smooth muscle function after cryopreservation but independent of rejection. One saphenous vein from each of eight dogs was cryopreserved for subsequent use as autografts. After 3 weeks one cryopreserved and one freshly harvested autogenous saphenous vein were implanted as bilateral femoral arterial interposition grafts. Platelet deposition was studied in vivo with indium 111-labeled platelets. At 4 weeks the autografts were removed, and the functional characteristics of the grafts were studied in organ chambers; and the ability of nerve terminals to uptake transmitter was studied with 3H-norepinephrine. Neither patency rates, blood flows, nor platelet deposition were significantly different between freshly harvested and cryopreserved grafts. Uptake of 3H-norepinephrine was significantly reduced in both grafts as compared to unoperated veins. The smooth muscle of the cryopreserved and fresh grafts contracted comparably to alpha-adrenergic agonists and endothelin. In cryopreserved grafts, the maximal tensions that developed to KCl, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and endothelin were greater when the endothelium was present compared to that developed by the smooth muscle alone. Calcium ionophore A23187 caused relaxations only in rings with endothelium; these were not significantly different between graft types. However, relaxations of the smooth muscle to nitric oxide were decreased in the cryopreserved grafts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

From October 1985 to December 1989, 101 patients were treated for 106 vascular complications after 1866 interventional and 5046 diagnostic cardiac catheterizations at the University of Michigan Medical Center. Interventional catheterizations resulted in 69 vascular complications in 64 patients (frequency 3.4%). The most common interventions included coronary angioplasty (34), of which 10 required percutaneous partial cardiopulmonary bypass, intraaortic balloon pump placement (14), and aortic valvuloplasty (11). Interventional catheter-related complications included hemorrhage (33), arterial thrombosis (18), pseudoaneurysm formation (12), catheter embolization (2), thromboembolism (2), as well as arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm, and arterial dissection (1 each). Fifteen of these 69 patients (24%) had suffered acute myocardial infarction just before their catheterization. Surgical repair was performed under local anesthesia in 70% of patients. Major vascular reconstructions were required in 9% of patients. Three percent of the involved lower extremities had to be amputated because of complications occurring after arterial puncture. Eight percent of the patients incurring vascular complications after interventional procedures died after operation. Diagnostic catheterizations resulted in 37 vascular complications in 37 patients (frequency 0.7%). In contrast to diagnostic cardiac catheterization, vascular complications after interventional cardiac catheterization occurred more frequently, were most often due to hemorrhage at the vascular access site, and occurred in high-risk, critically ill patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized that even brief periods of reperfusion interjected between ischemic episodes would increase tissue injury. Studies were performed in a rat small intestine preparation in which metabolic, hemodynamic, and histologic responses to ischemia have been well characterized. Animals were subjected to a total of 30 or 45 minutes of complete intestinal ischemia. Flow interruption was continuous (C, single episode) or intermittent (I, two or three episodes of 15-minute ischemia separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion). In some experiments 5-minute reperfusions were performed with arterial blood depleted of leukocytes (IL). This additional perturbation was included to determine the role of neutrophils that have been strongly implicated in reperfusion injury. In all three protocols histologic sections were obtained after each ischemic insult and after 1 hour of reperfusion with arterial blood. Villous histology was graded in a blinded fashion with 1 = normal and 5 = severe injury. No significant differences were found between groups in immediate postischemic histologies before reperfusion. After 1 hour of reperfusion, intermittent episodes of ischemia were associated with significantly worse histologic injury than that seen with comparable durations of continuous ischemia (30 min: I, 4.4 +/- 0.5 vs C, 2.7 +/- 0.4; 45 min: I, 4.9 +/- 0.2 vs C, 2.8 +/- 0.3). However, if 5-minute reperfusions were with leukopenic blood, this effect was markedly reduced (30 min IL, 3.4 +/- 0.3; 45 min IL, 3.6 +/- 0.2). Even short periods of reperfusion during an ischemic insult greatly increased mucosal injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This series reviews a preliminary experience treating patients with superficial femoral arterial disease admitted with limb-threatening ischemia or claudication. Twenty-six diseased superficial femoral arteries (5 stenotic and 21 occluded) were treated in 23 consecutive patients. Patients with claudication (18) reluctant to undergo bypass or with limb-threatening ischemia (8) at extremely high risk for surgery were included. There were 10 men and 13 women with a mean age of 67 years. A 308 nm excimer laser with an over-the-wire catheter (19) or balloon-centered end-on catheter (7) was used followed by balloon angioplasty. Twenty-four procedures were performed percutaneously, and two were performed with the vessel open in the operating room. Technical success, defined as disobliteration confirmed by angiography and greater than 0.15 increase of the ankle/brachial index, was achieved in 15 of 26. Eleven of 21 occlusions (52%) and four of five stenoses (80%) were opened. Only two of 11 lesions longer than 10 cm were successfully treated. Unsuccessful attempts (technical failure) occurred in 11 of 26 patients and resulted in four elective and one emergency femoral-popliteal bypass. Five patients were discharged with their claudication unchanged, and one had an elective amputation. Six arterial perforations with three arteriovenous fistulas occurred, all resolved without operation. No unanticipated limb loss occurred. In the 15 successful cases, the mean ankle/brachial index increase was 0.34. Seven (47%) of these 15 remain patent with a mean follow-up of 9.5 months (1.5 to 14 months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Toward this end 21 mongrel dogs were studied in four groups and underwent 60 minutes of thoracic aortic cross-clamping: group I, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping; group II, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and cerebral spinal fluid drainage; group III, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping, cerebrospinal fluid drainage and intravenous administration of a single dose (5000 units/kg) of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) given 15 to 20 minutes before thoracic aortic cross-clamping; and group IV, six with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and PEG-SOD. Paraplegia was graded by the Tarlov method at 24 hours and up to 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. The carotid and femoral artery pressures, the central venous pressure, and core temperature, taken during the experiment and at the time the dogs were killed, were found to be similar between groups. At 24 hours all dogs in group I were paraplegic; groups II and III had no paraplegic dogs (p less than 0.01), and group IV had fewer paraplegic dogs (two of six) than group I (p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "A mathematic model of unilateral iliac vein obstruction was used to establish the theoretic basis for selecting saphenous vein or a larger diameter prosthetic cross-femoral venous bypass graft for relief of obstructive venous hypertension. Common femoral vein resting and postexercise peak flows, and common femoral vein and saphenous vein diameters were measured in 18 healthy individuals and used to estimate the pressure gradient (dP) across 20 cm long cross-femoral venous bypass grafts of saphenous vein or 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mm prosthetic conduits, in the presence of a transpelvic venous collateral network of varied cross section. The upper limits of normal for the gradients in our model (dPstd) were set at 4 mm Hg for resting flows and 6 mm Hg after exercise. Mean saphenous vein diameter was 4.3 +/- 0.22 mm, which was 36.5% +/- 1.73% of common femoral vein diameter. When the saphenous veins of two thirds of the individuals in our study were used as theoretic cross-femoral venous bypass conduits, greater than 80% of postobstruction peak cross-femoral venous bypass graft flow had to be carried by collaterals to maintain a gradient less than or equal to dPstd. We demonstrated that 4.5 to 6.0 mm diameter saphenous cross-femoral venous bypass grafts would be hemodynamically efficacious in relieving venous hypertension, but only when implanted in parallel with an existing venous collateral network that limited the preoperative dP to 4.5 to 7.5 mm Hg at resting flows and 7.0 to 11.5 mm Hg after exercise; only 44% of saphenous veins were adequate for cross-femoral venous bypass grafts by these criteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Autogenous veins were used in 175 (69%) cases, composite vein-prosthetic grafts were used in 45 (18%), and prosthetic grafts alone were used in 33 (13%). Follow-up ranged from 0 to 101 months (mean, 19 months); 37 grafts (15%) were lost to follow-up. The operative mortality rate was 4%, and 5-year patient survival rate was 44%. Limb salvage was 82% at 5 years. The 5-year patency of vein grafts (63%) exceeded that of both composite (28%) and prosthetic (7%) grafts (p = 0.005 and p = 0.00007, respectively); but the patency of composite and prosthetic grafts did not differ significantly (p = 0.29). The patency of reversed vein (59%) and in situ vein grafts (74%) was not significantly different at 5 years (p = 0.34). Patency was also not affected by the site of the proximal or distal anastomoses or diabetes. The major determinant of long-term patency in infrapopliteal reconstructions continues to be graft material. Composite grafts offered no clear advantage over prosthetic grafts, and both should be used only when there is no other alternative to amputation.\r"

During ischemia and reperfusion, hemodynamic parameters, superior mesenteric artery flow, intestinal mucosal perfusion, and mucosal permeability were monitored. After 12 hours of reperfusion, the volumes of intravenous electrolyte fluid required to maintain hemodynamic stability and fluid lost into the gastrointestinal tract and peritoneal cavity were measured. The distribution of total body water was analyzed by use of radionuclide dilution techniques. Group A animals underwent laparotomy only, group B had the supraceliac aorta occluded for 45 minutes, group C had superoxide dismutase administered after 45 minutes of aortic occlusion, and group D animals were exposed to mild hypothermia during a similar ischemia and reperfusion period. No significant difference was found in mean superior mesenteric artery flow or mucosal perfusion during ischemia among groups B, C, and D. During reperfusion superior mesenteric artery flow returned to values similar to control in all groups. Aortic occlusion increased mucosal permeability most significantly in group B (p less than 0.01). Mean intravenous fluid requirements (ml/mg) were the following: group A, 80 +/- 5; group B, 201 +/- 9 (p less than 0.01); group C, 116 +/- 7 (p less than 0.05); group D, 245 +/- 24 (p less than 0.05).

From October 1987 to May 1990, 15 arterial bypasses to the lower extremity (infrainguinal saphenous vein [n = 7] or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [n = 6], and Dacron aortofemoral bifurcation graft limbs [n = 2]) were treated for 30 occulsions with intraarterial urokinase (390,000 IU to 5,808,000 IU) infused from 3 to 40 hours. The origins of 15 graft occlusions were morphologic defects (intimal hyperplasia with anastomotic or conduit stricture), pseudoaneurysm, or progression of disease distal to the graft. Two occlusions were attributed to coagulation disorders. A cause could not be identified for 13 occlusions. Patency was initially restored to all grafts with use of thrombolytic therapy, however, adjunctive surgical thrombectomy to remove persistent thrombus from the graft or outflow vessels was required after six thrombolytic infusions. One graft in the series could not be salvaged leading to below-knee amputation. Graft defects were corrected by balloon angioplasty (n = 7) or surgical revision of the conduit (n = 8). Five significant hemorrhagic complications occurred from the catheter insertion site requiring four emergent surgical procedures and resulting in the death of a fifth patient from a myocardial infarction. This technique allows chemical thrombectomy of branch arteries distal to the graft and inaccessible to a balloon embolectomy catheter, and permits diagnosis of abnormal graft morphology that may be the cause of the graft occlusion. Graft reocclusion can be expected if technical defects in the arterial reconstruction are not revised or hypercoagulable states are not treated.\r"

  ".W": "Atherosclerosis is the paramount cause of late vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting. Lipid peroxidation, which may play a significant role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, was examined in segments of vein grafts (n = 6) harvested at reoperation for coronary disease. These were analyzed for cholesterol, phospholipid, triglyceride, and lipid peroxides. Nonatherosclerotic vascular tissues, including coronary arteries (n = 6), saphenous veins (n = 9), and donor aortic specimens (n = 11) were analyzed for comparison. Risk factors for atherosclerosis including elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides, smoking, and hypertension were more frequent in patients with coronary artery disease compared to organ donors. Lipid peroxides were elevated in explanted vein grafts when compared to either saphenous vein, coronary artery or donor aorta. Lipid peroxides were not significantly different in saphenous vein when compared to coronary artery, but levels in both of these tissues were greater than in donor aorta. Although increased levels of lipid peroxides in explanted veins may simply reflect morphologic changes in these grafts, the known effects of lipid peroxides on a number of biochemical events suggest that they may contribute directly to graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether color-flow imaging enhances the accuracy of noninvasive carotid evaluation, the results of carotid duplex examinations from two laboratories, one with color-flow and the other with standard duplex imaging were compared. The techniques used by both laboratories were identical. All studies were interpreted by one of the authors, using the same criteria. From October 1988 through December 1989, 307 internal carotid arteries were evaluated with both color-flow imaging and standard angiography; and 206 underwent routine duplex scanning and angiography. Perfect agreement between test and angiographic results was significantly better with color-flow (86.6%) than with conventional duplex scanning (79.6%), p = 0.034 (t test for independent samples). Significantly fewer vessels were over classified by one category with color-flow (8.5%) than with routine duplex scanning (16.5%), p = 0.006. However, no difference was found in the number under-classified by one category (4.5% vs 3.4%), p = 0.5. Although these data support the accuracy of both modalities, there appears to be a trend toward improved results with the newer method. We attribute this to more precise placement of the pulsed Doppler sample volume afforded by the color-flow image.\r"

  ".W": "Autogenous vein tissue is recognized as the preferred material for extremity revascularizations that require the use of a conduit. However, the results after vascular repair of injured extremity arteries with autogenous vein interposition or bypass grafts have not been well defined. This study was done to determine both the early and late patency and limb salvage rates as well as the graft infection rate of autogenous vein repairs of injured extremity arteries. The records of 134 consecutive patients with acute extremity arterial injuries requiring repair with a reversed autogenous vein graft over a recent 5-year period were reviewed. Follow-up graft patency was defined by the presence of a palpable pulse and an extremity Doppler-derived pressure index of greater than or equal to 0.9 distal to the arterial repair. Cumulative patency was assessed by the life-table method. Acute graft thrombosis occurred in two patients, one of whom underwent successful graft thrombectomy. Four patients (3%) required extremity amputation: one patient with a thrombosed vein graft and three patients with patent vein grafts but nonsalvageable limbs as a result of myonecrosis (2) or osteomyelitis (1). No perioperative graft infections occurred. One hundred twenty-eight patients (97%) had an intact extremity and a patent vein graft at the time of hospital discharge. One hundred three patients (80%) were examined at 30 days, and all grafts were patent. Seventy-three patients (57%) were available for follow-up at intervals exceeding 6 months, and 40 patients (31%) were followed-up for periods exceeding 24 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We evaluated in situ aortic grafting in the treatment of primary or graft-related aortic infection. Eleven selected patients underwent in situ aortic graft reconstruction in the setting of mycotic aneurysm (n = 5), secondarily infected aortic aneurysm (n = 1), primary aortoenteric fistula (n = 1), and secondary aortoenteric fistula (n = 4). All patients survived: follow-up from 10 to 130 months reveals no evidence for graft thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, new or recurrent aortoenteric fistula, or subsequent aortic operations in any patient. A literature review produced 110 cases of aortic sepsis managed by in situ aortic reconstruction during the last decade. Thirty-two patients (29%) either died in the operative period or suffered a lethal late complication associated with their aortic reconstruction. This mortality rate declined to 21% if patients undergoing incomplete removal of a contaminated graft were excluded, and to 19% with the addition of our 11 patients. Both our experience and that described in the literature suggest that, in properly-selected patients, in situ aortic graft replacement may be a rational treatment option for localized or circumscribed aortic sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "From November 1979 through December 1989, 210 distal arteriovenous fistulas were constructed as adjuncts to tibial and peroneal vascular reconstructive procedures in 203 patients threatened with limb loss. Two-year cumulative patency rates were calculated by grouping patients on the basis of changing indications in sequential time periods: group 1 (n = 61): 1979 to 1983, 18%; group 2 (n = 80): 1983 to 1986, 33%; group 3 (n = 69): 1986 to 1989, 44%. Although the therapeutic results observed in these groups are not statistically comparable, they show a perceptible trend. Postoperative arteriography showed that flow is prograde in the distal vessels beyond the distal arteriovenous fistula. Graft surveillance by duplex ultrasonography also confirmed that flow in the distal arteries is prograde and that \"steal\" does not occur. Peak systolic velocity (174 +/- 38 cm/sec) and mean velocity (92 +/- 23) flow rates are increased in grafts with patent distal arteriovenous fistulas compared to those bypasses with closed distal arteriovenous fistulas (p less than 0.01). There were no differences in the flow measurements for the arteries beyond the distal anastomoses and distal arteriovenous fistulas, confirming the prograde nature of the distal flow. In 22 patients analysis of graft and fistula patency by duplex sonography showed that one fourth of all grafts were patent without fistulas at 1 and 2 years after operation. Alternatively, 68% of patent grafts at 1 year had patent fistulas and 58% had patent fistulas at 2 years. We conclude that the distal arteriovenous fistula will increase graft flow and simultaneously prevent distal arterial overload without causing \"steal.\" This technique should be considered whenever a prosthetic graft is necessary for crural reconstruction and only in selected instances of revascularization with autologous veins.\r"

Attempts to isolate the aneurysm can lead to operative injuries of these structures, thus increasing the rates of complications and mortality. In the last 12 years 45 patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent aneurysm resection at the Department of Vascular Surgery of the University of Rome. The aneurysm was resected through a standard, midline transperitoneal approach in 39 patients, through a thoracophrenolaparotomy in two patients, and through a left-flank extraperitoneal approach in the last four patients. The extraperitoneal approach simplified aneurysm dissection and aortic clamping with no cases of postoperative morbidity or death. In addition, we reviewed the CT scan findings of 12 patients surgically treated for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. The amount of fibrosis in the anterior wall of the aneurysm was greater than in the left posterolateral aspect (p = 0.008). We conclude that the left-flank extraperitoneal approach is the most anatomically advantageous route for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm.\r"

Peak systolic and time-averaged maximal flow velocity parameters were measured in the arteria profunda femoris and compared with independently performed angiography. For detecting stenoses greater than 30% diameter reduction (50% by area) of the arteria profunda femoris, duplex scanning had a sensitivity of 91% and 96%, a specificity of 85% and 98%, a positive predictive value of 86% and 98%, and a negative predictive value of 91% and 96%, for a peak systolic velocity of 180 cm/sec and more, and for a time-averaged maximal velocity of 50 cm/sec and more in the arteria profunda femoris, respectively. The day-to-day variability for peak systolic and time-averaged maximal velocity parameters was low with correlation coefficients between velocity measurements on both days of 0.96 and 0.98 (n = 20), respectively. In 10 patients with arteria profunda femoris stenoses and superficial femoral artery occlusions, undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of arteria profunda femoris stenosis, the duplex scan revealed a reduction in stenotic peak systolic velocity from 330 +/- 84 to 163 +/- 50 cm/sec and a decrease in stenotic time-averaged maximal velocity from 156 +/- 47 to 54 +/- 17 cm/sec after the interventional procedure. These results show that peak systolic and time-averaged maximal velocities are accurate parameters to detect significant arteria profunda femoris stenosis in patients with superficial femoral artery occlusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The following groups were defined: group 1 - nonreconstructable disease (n = 40); group 2 - transmetatarsal amputation in conjunction with distal revascularization (n = 99); group 3 - reconstructable disease but transmetatarsal amputation performed without simultaneous revascularization (n = 21). There were nine early deaths in the entire series, for an operative mortality rate of 5.6%. The lowest rate of transmetatarsal amputation healing (24%) occurred in group 1. An 86% healing rate was achieved in group 3, but in seven cases (33%) some type of revascularization was required within 3 months of the amputation. In group 2 the healing rate was 62% but reached 83% where the bypass remained patent for at least 3 months after the amputation. Long-term patency rates also affected healing. Healing was not influenced by the number of local procedures (single vs multiple). The presence of severe infection or extensive necrosis necessitated open transmetatarsal amputation in 89 cases; the remaining 71 amputations involved primary closure. Since many patients were treated at a time when diagnostic modalities as well as the operative indications and techniques differed somewhat from the current practice, much of the information regarding group I patients in particular should be considered as a negative historical control and any conclusion from our data should be adjusted accordingly. Healing after amputation at the transmetatarsal level can be expected in the majority of instances in which revascularization can be performed with predictable patency, even when the standard criteria for performing such amputations are liberalized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Except for the first patient, operated on in 1973, in whom the kidney was protected by general hypothermia, no special measure was used to protect the kidneys. A transient increase in creatinemia occurred in 11 patients during the postoperative period, whereas creatinine values remained unchanged in the other four. All patients had regained renal function identical to the + preoperative state in less than 10 days; three of them had significant improvement as a result of correction of a lesion that was impairing renal blood flow. Results obtained in this series show that protection of the transplant during aortic surgery is not necessary, provided an adequate surgical technique is used. This technique avoids the complex methods employed in the majority of previously reported cases and appears to be a safe procedure.\r"

Hemorrhage constituted 2% and 1% of asymptomatic and symptomatic plaques, respectively. The predominant nonfibrous material was a pink amorphous material mixed with cholesterol, which composed 7% of asymptomatic and 27% of symptomatic plaques (p less than 0.05). No relationship was found between plaque composition and the number of ipsilateral ischemic neurologic events, nor was there evidence of a healing process. B-mode ultrasound scanning had a sensitivity of 94% in identifying plaque with greater than 80% fibrous content.
