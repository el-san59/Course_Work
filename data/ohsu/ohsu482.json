Among seropositive men with low initial T helper lymphocyte counts, those who continued to use drugs showed no significantly higher 18-month risk of AIDS than nonusers (13% vs 10%); the corresponding risks were 13% and 15%, respectively, for continued heavier vs continued lighter consumption of alcohol. No other manifestations of immunodeficiency were positively associated with substance use prior to enrollment. Prior use was not associated with low mean T helper cell counts at enrollment, and continued drug or alcohol use after enrollment was not associated with greater subsequent decline in counts. As used in a large cohort of homosexual men, psychoactive substances did not enhance the progression of human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

In this way, reversible factors can be identified and corrected before they progress to inspiratory muscle fatigue and respiratory failure. For cases in which deterioration is inexorable, guidelines for mechanical ventilation are given and approaches to eventual liberation from the ventilator are reviewed.\r"

These patients received varying combinations of cyclosporine, azathioprine, prednisone, rabbit antithymocyte globulin, and OKT3 as their immunosuppressive therapy. Two hundred ten patients were free of CMV infection (non-CMV group). During the same period CMV infection developed in 91 patients, as manifested by a fourfold IgG serologic titer rise, demonstration of CMV inclusion bodies in tissue, or positive cultures for the virus (CMV group). The rate of graft rejection was significantly higher in the CMV group. Graft atherosclerosis was significantly more severe in the CMV group as judged by angiographic criteria or by pathologic study. Patient survival rates were significantly lower in the CMV group. Death caused by graft atherosclerosis was significantly more common among patients in the CMV group. Finally, the graft loss rate (from either death or retransplantation for atherosclerosis) was significantly greater in the CMV group. These data demonstrate that CMV infection in cardiac transplant recipients is associated with more frequent rejection, graft atherosclerosis, and death.\r"

This evaluation addresses: (1) the burden of suffering attributable to physical inactivity; (2) the efficacy of physical activity in disease prevention in regard to six medical conditions; and (3) the characteristics of the intervention in terms of simplicity, cost, safety, acceptability, and patient compliance. Based on consideration of the evidence for each of these issues, specific recommendations are made regarding the role of physical activity counseling in routine clinical practice. In addition, practical guidelines are presented to aid clinicians in physical activity counseling.\r"

In the case reported herein, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion, etoposide, and cisplatin induced a partial response permitting complete excision of a massive tumor of the right upper lobe involving the chest wall and superior vena cava. The patient relapsed with a metastasis to the brain that was surgically excised. Contralateral lung metastases were soon noted and responded well to systemic chemotherapy; yet the patient died of a new brain metastasis. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a primary choriocarcinoma of the lung treated with intensive multimodality therapy. The latter seems to offer a potential benefit if certain guidelines are followed.\r"

  ".U": "89260387\r", 
  ".W": "Accelerated coronary arteriosclerosis remains the most important factor limiting long-term survival of heart transplant recipients, and dietary fish oil supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been suggested to have a protective effect against coronary disease in epidemiologic studies and to inhibit arteriosclerosis in animal experiments. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that fish oil administration inhibits the development of allograft coronary arteriosclerosis by using a heterotopic heart transplant model. Three groups of Lewis rats (n = 10 each) received heterotopic heart transplants from Brown-Norway donors and were treated with cyclosporine intraperitoneally on a tapering schedule. Group 1 received fish oil daily by gavage (2 ml/kg/day; Emulsified Super MaxEpa, Twin Labs, Ronkonkona, N.Y.). Group 2 received an equal amount of safflower oil, as well as aspirin (1 mg/kg/day) and dipyridamole (3 mg/kg/day). Group 3 received safflower oil only. All rats were put to death 110 days later, at which time there was no statistically significant difference in graft function as assessed by palpation (scale 0 to 4, mean = 3.7 +/- 0.5 [+/- standard deviation]; analysis of variance: p = 0.72) or in microscopic grade of rejection (scale, 0 = none to 3 = severe, mean 2.1 +/- 0.6; analysis of variance: p = 0.68) between any of the groups. The coronary arteries were histologically scored for the degree of arteriosclerosis (scale, 0 = normal to 3 = occluded), and a mean grade of coronary disease was calculated for each heart. The fish oil-treated group had significantly less severe allograft coronary arteriosclerosis (analysis of variance: p = 0.005) than did groups 2 and 3 (mean grade 0.23 +/- 0.22 versus 1.04 +/- 0.75 and 0.96 +/- 0.55 (p less than 0.05, Scheffe F test), whereas groups 2 and 3 had similar degrees of coronary disease (p = no significant difference). These data demonstrate that fish oil supplementation inhibited accelerated coronary arteriosclerosis in this cyclosporine-treated heart allograft rat model, whereas antiplatelet agents in these doses were ineffective. Although the mechanism of this protective effect remains incompletely understood, it does not appear to involve enhanced immunosuppression. Fish oil and specific omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids should be further investigated as potentially useful agents to ameliorate accelerated allograft coronary arteriosclerosis in other animal species and perhaps eventually in man.\r"

In this study, levels of the two plasticizers were measured in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, orthotopic transplantation, implantation of the Jarvik 7-70 total artificial heart during bridge-to-transplant procedures, and in infants who underwent corrective operations for congenital defects. In all adult patients the levels of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate increased tenfold by the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, whereas the levels of mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate increased ninefold. In infants, levels of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate rose seven times by the end of bypass and mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate rose significantly as well. In most of the patients having coronary bypass, the two plasticizers declined to preoperative levels within 24 hours. However, in some of the patients having orthotopic transplantation and in those in whom the Jarvik 7-70 total artificial heart was used as a bridge to transplant, the levels were still detectable 120 hours postoperatively. Circulating levels of mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate are only 20- to 35-fold lower in patients undergoing cardiac operations than the level of mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate causing a 50% reduction in developed contractile force and arrhythmias in an in vitro human atrial trabecular preparation. This study shows that patients with multisystem failure and infants may be at risk for this acute exposure to mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate.\r"

In this study, we extended the preservation time up to 12 hours and, using various parameters, compared lung function after 12 hours' preservation with that after 6 hours' preservation. The left lung of 15 dogs was perfused with 300 ml of the UCLA formula (4 degrees C) and preserved for 6 hours in eight dogs (group A) and for 12 hours in the other seven dogs (group B). The preserved left lung was then autotransplanted and pulmonary function was evaluated during the following 2 weeks. The oxygen tension was monitored at 2 and 12 hours postoperatively, then daily for 1 week, and on the fourteenth postoperative day. The right pulmonary artery was temporarily occluded to assess the function of the preserved left lung alone. Oxygen tension in group A was maintained within the normal range. By contrast, in group B transient deterioration in oxygen tension was observed from the third to the fourth postoperative day (p less than 0.01), improving toward the normal range by the seventh day. Pulmonary vascular resistance was significantly elevated after transplantation in group B, improving to the normal range by the fourteenth postoperative day. Lung compliance, according to the airway pressure-tidal volume curve, also deteriorated significantly in group B (p less than 0.01), improving to the normal range within 2 weeks. Lung perfusion scintigraphy with technetium-labeled macroaggregated albumin was performed on the fourth day after the operation. The ratio of left to right pulmonary flow on the fourth postoperative day was 57.1 +/- 8.5% in group A and 52.2% +/- 12.3% in group B (no significant difference). In conclusion, temporary deterioration of lung function was observed after 12 hours of lung preservation, manifested by impaired oxygen exchange and loss of compliance.\r"

Although several sensor-driven pacemakers are currently under investigation, activity-sensing pacemakers have been used most frequently to date. We assessed our implantation and follow-up experience with 156 activity-sensing pacemakers. Analysis of the patient population revealed an age range of 6 to 91 years and a variety of indications for pacing, the most common being atrioventricular block. Specific programming techniques were adopted for assessing these pacemakers. Although several episodes of reprogramming may be necessary to identify the optimal sensor settings for an individual patient, once optimal programming has been achieved, the sensing characteristics seem to have long-term stability. An important part of our follow-up procedure involves transtelephonic exercise, which allows some degree of long-term assessment of the sensor. All but six patients with pacemakers programmed to the sensor-driven mode (VVIR or AAIR) had evidence of sensor-driven pacing during transtelephonic exercise. Thus, this adjunct seems helpful for follow-up of some rate-modulated pacemakers.\r"

The outcome is dependent on the extent of visceral involvement. Vascular inflammation influences the physiologic features of the vessel and may trigger vasoconstriction. Although glucocorticoids combat the inflammation, they may augment vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. These effects must be considered in designing a management approach and in evaluating the cause and management of ischemic complications.\r"

We found EN at least once in 28 of 41 allografts (68%) that had survived 6 months or longer. In approximately half the affected cases, the condition recurred. The EN was mild in most instances; moderate or severe manifestations were found in only 13% of the cases. The histologic changes were present for about 1 week in approximately half the cases; a duration of more than 2 weeks was noted in 17%, and then EN usually persisted. After retransplantation, recurrence of EN was observed in all of nine cases. We were unable to establish specific clinicopathologic and laboratory correlations for EN. The immunocytes in EN consisted mainly of helper and suppressor/cytotoxic T cells as well as natural killer cells. Sometimes, the immunocytes assumed a blastlike appearance; in these instances, the condition was severe. Such blastlike changes may be specific for EN. The immunocytes were attached to the endothelium by pseudopodia, broad bases, or both; some also were interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges. Underlying endothelial cells often showed evidence of cytoplasmic damage. The pathogenesis of EN is not completely understood; the immunocytes probably attach themselves to antigenic epitopes. Their nature, however, has not been clearly identified; HLA-A, B, and C and HLA-DR were displayed in areas of EN, but the antigens also were found in vessels without EN.\r"

In this main study group of 53 patients, major infections developed in 28 (53%) (a mean of 1.8 major episodes per infected patient). Of 51 major infections, 27 were bacterial, 19 were viral, 3 were protozoan, and 2 were fungal. Of the 27 bacterial infections, 22 (81%) occurred in the first 2 months after transplantation. Of the 40 bacterial isolates in the 27 bacterial infections, gram-positive aerobic bacteria were isolated in 26 (65%), anaerobic bacteria in 8 (20%), and aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 6 (15%). Only 1 of 16 bacteremic episodes was due to a gram-negative aerobic bacterium. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection occurred in 30 of the 53 patients (57%) and was symptomatic and invasive in 18. CMV infection was diagnosed a mean of 26 days after transplantation. Infections due to Pneumocystis carinii occurred later (2 to 3 months after transplantation). Death from infection occurred in 4 of the 53 patients (8%). In the group of 16 patients with two or more liver transplantations, fungal infection occurred in 2 and CMV infection in 13. In all 16 patients who underwent more than one liver transplantation, a major infection developed. The observations made in the main study group were consistent with findings in 13 patients with one liver transplantation but less than 6 months of follow-up. Infection is a major complication after liver transplantation, generally occurring in the first 2 months. Our observations suggest that the use of selective bowel decontamination may be associated with a relatively lower incidence of gram-negative aerobic bacterial infections.\r"

Biopsy specimens were obtained from 70 hepatic allografts from patients treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Rejection was diagnosed by the presence of appropriate laboratory and light microscopic findings and at least 16 weeks of follow-up to exclude other causes of graft dysfunction. Three immunohistologic patterns were noted: no or only a trace of T lymphocytes, predominantly TH infiltrate with or without a small amount of TS/C cells (portal TH), and a mixture of TH with an equal or greater number of TS/C infiltrate (portal mix). Of 68 biopsy specimens obtained during quiescent periods, only 3 had a portal tract T-lymphocyte infiltrate.

At the time of the rejection episode, 33 biopsy specimens were immunohistologically labeled; portal tract T-lymphocyte infiltrate was predominantly TH in 8 and a mixture of TH and TS/C in 25. All rejection episodes with a predominantly TH pattern responded to methylprednisolone. Of the 25 rejection episodes with a portal mix pattern, only 3 responded to methylprednisolone. Eighty-seven biopsy specimens were obtained more than 10 days after treatment of rejection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This review covers recent advances in neuropathology, immunogenetics, neuroimmunology, and neurovirology that have provided insights regarding its pathogenesis. Three hypotheses are discussed: (1) autoimmunity, (2) \"bystander\" demyelination, and (3) immune destruction of persistently infected oligodendrocytes. A paradigm for induction of primary demyelination is proposed in which immune cells recognize \"foreign\" antigens on the surface of oligodendrocytes in the context of major histocompatibility complex gene products. The final result of this scheme may be \"dying-back gliopathy,\" the alteration being noted first in the most distal extension of the oligodendrocyte--that is, the myelin sheaths.\r"

Support for the diagnosis as well as aid in the exclusion of other disorders can be obtained from other investigations. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid can provide evidence of a central nervous system inflammatory process; evoked potential studies can provide evidence of subclinical multifocal involvement of the central nervous system. Magnetic resonance imaging can reveal dissemination of white matter lesions and help in the exclusion of other neurologic disorders. These tests have been incorporated into the modern diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis. The natural history of multiple sclerosis is variable; accordingly, early in the clinical course of the disorder, predicting the prognosis for a specific patient is usually difficult. Nevertheless, some features have limited predictive value.\r"

The clinical manifestations of alcoholic liver disease are nonspecific and range from asymptomatic hepatomegaly to stigmata of portal hypertension with advanced parenchymal failure. The severity of the clinical presentation and the degree of aminotransferase elevation correlate poorly with the liver histopathology, particularly in patients who continue to drink alcohol. Short-term mortality of such patients is best predicted by a composite of clinical and laboratory parameters that are influenced by alcohol consumption as well as by liver disease. Long-term prognosis is determined by residual damage to vital organs (that is, whether or not cirrhosis has developed) and whether or not the patient continues to drink. Current therapy of alcoholic liver disease includes abstinence and correction of nutritional deficiencies. Other therapies are experimental and are best utilized in the setting of controlled clinical trials.\r"

The clinical course of PBC is variable ranging from a few years in rapidly progressive cases to a normal life-expectancy in a proportion of asymptomatic cases. The typical patient is a middle-aged woman who may present with pruritus, increasing pigmentation of the skin, and eventually jaundice. The level of serum alkaline phosphatase is almost invariably elevated, serum mitochondrial antibodies are present in more than 90 per cent, and an elevated serum IgM is usually present. PBC is associated with many immunologic abnormalities and appears to be a classic autoimmune disease. Some of the immune defects may be epiphenomena; others such as a marked defect in suppressor T cell function seem to be related to the pathogenesis of the disease. All drug therapy that is aimed at slowing the disease process is experimental. A place for immunosuppressive drugs in the management of PBC would be anticipated. However, no drug has to date been definitively shown to have a beneficial effect on the disease. Currently, the main treatments used are aimed at preventing or correcting the complications of intractable cholestasis. Patients with PBC and evidence of hepatic decompensation and/or poor quality of life make good candidates for liver transplantation. The current aim of therapy is to find an effective regime of immunosuppression that will make hepatic transplantation redundant for this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Portal hypertension is a frequent syndrome characterized by a chronic increase in portal venous pressure and by the formation of portal-systemic collaterals. Its main consequence is massive bleeding from ruptured esophageal and gastric varices. Bleeding is promoted by increased portal and variceal pressure, and is favored by dilatation of the varices. The evaluation of the portal hypertensive patient should include the assessment of portal vein patency by ultrasonography, endoscopic evaluation of the presence, size, and extent of esophageal varices, and hemodynamic studies with measurements of portal pressure and of portal-collateral blood flow. The preferred techniques are hepatic vein catheterization and measurement of azygos blood flow. Endoscopic measurements of variceal pressure and estimations of portal blood velocity by the Doppler technique have recently been introduced, but are still research procedures. Acute variceal hemorrhage should be treated under intensive care. Specific therapy to arrest variceal bleeding includes balloon tamponade, vasopressin, somatostatin, sclerotherapy, and emergency surgery. Treatment of portal hypertension is aimed at preventing variceal hemorrhage and bleeding-related deaths. Pharmacologic prophylaxis is based on the use of drugs that cause a sustained reduction in portal pressure; most studies have used propranolol. Surgery and endoscopic sclerotherapy can also be used to prevent rebleeding.\r"

Evidence that the development of hepatocellular carcinoma is related to chronic HBV infection has accumulated from epidemiologic studies, information from animal and cell culture models, and molecular biologic evidence that HBV components can be found within hepatocellular carcinoma tissue. Integration of HBV DNA within host liver cell chromosomes may be a crucial step in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Integration is associated with disruption of both structure and function of DNA at the site of integration. The study of individual examples of HBV DNA integration in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue illustrates possible mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis by HBV. In many cases, activation of various growth factors has been found in association with HBV DNA integration including IGF II, oncogenes such as c-myc, and novel growth factors such as the retinoic acid receptor. A clearer understanding of the mechanisms involved may allow for possible therapeutic interventions in the future, or perhaps even the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Rescreening of subjects with negative results every 2 years (9510 first rescreen, 3639 second) has shown a significant fall in the rate of positive results (1.7% of 7344; 0.3% of 2906). Cancers have also been diagnosed in 20 subjects presenting in the interval between a negative test and rescreening, and in 83 non-responders. The incidence of cancer in the control group (123 subjects; 10.6% stage A) was 0.72 per 1000 person-years.

For patients with non-bleeding visible vessels sham treatment was significantly less effective in achieving haemostasis (8 of 20 patients) than were adrenaline plus polidocanol (18 of 20; p = 0.002) and adrenaline plus laser (16 of 20; p = 0.012). All three treatments significantly reduced total transfusion needs compared with sham treatment. For the whole group of patients, adrenaline plus polidocanol was significantly more effective than adrenaline alone in achieving permanent haemostasis; adrenaline plus laser was also more effective than adrenaline alone, but not significantly so. The efficacy of the three treatments was enhanced by repeated application on recurrence of bleeding. Since injection therapy with adrenaline and polidocanol was at least as effective as adrenaline plus laser therapy, it should be preferred over laser therapy because it is cheaper, easier to use, and perhaps also safer.\r"

Twenty-five centres entered 1072 patients into the study between 1 week and 4 months after their qualifying stroke. The patients were treated and followed for up to 3 years (mean 24 months). In the efficacy analysis, the event rate per year for stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death, considered together, was 15.3% in the placebo group and 10.8% in the ticlopidine group, representing a relative risk reduction with ticlopidine of 30.2% (95% confidence interval 7.5-48.3%; p = 0.006). Ticlopidine was beneficial for both men and women (relative risk reductions 28.1%, p = 0.037, and 34.2%, p = 0.045, respectively). Analysis by intention-to-treat gave a smaller estimate of risk reduction (23.3%, p = 0.020) for stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. Adverse experiences associated with ticlopidine included neutropenia (severe in about 1% of cases) and skin rash and diarrhoea (severe in 2% of cases each); all were reversible. This study provides evidence of a beneficial effect of ticlopidine in both men and women with a recent thromboembolic stroke.\r"

  ".W": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study on the effects of 4 months' growth hormone (GH) treatment was carried out in 22 GH-deficient adults (8 women, 14 men; mean [SEM] age 23.8 [1.2] years). 1 patient was withdrawn because of oedema. Mean total body weight of the other 21 did not change, whereas mean muscle volume of the thigh, estimated by computerised tomography (CT), was significantly higher after GH than after placebo (70.0 [3.7] vs 66.3 [3.1] ml/0.8 cm cross-sectional slice). The mean adipose tissue volume of the thigh and subscapular skinfold thickness fell significantly during GH treatment. Growth hormone caused a small increase in the isometric strength of the quadriceps muscles and a significant rise in exercise capacity (60.8 [7.2] vs 54.2 [6.6] kJ). The heart rate both at rest and after maximum exercise was low during the placebo period and increased significantly during GH treatment. Blood pressure and echocardiographic wall mass of the left ventricle did not change during the study. Growth hormone increased both mean glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow from a subnormal level on placebo to a level comparable with that of an age-matched control group. The filtration fraction did not change. Urinary albumin excretion was in the low normal range and was not affected by GH treatment. Finally, GH treatment normalised mean circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which were low after the placebo period (96 [9] micrograms/l placebo; 224 [28] micrograms/l GH). These findings suggest that GH, in a conventional replacement dose, has several potentially beneficial effects in GH-deficient adults and therefore encourage future long-term trials.\r"

There were no significant differences between the groups who received filtered and unfiltered blood in median gestation, birthweight, or amount of seropositive blood received (median volume 32.5 ml and 34.5 ml, respectively). 9 (21%) of the 42 infants who received unfiltered blood and none of the 30 who received filtered blood were infected with CMV. All infected infants weighed less than 1500 g at birth; they represented 31% of very low birthweight (VLBW) infants at risk of CMV infection. None of 24 VLBW infants who received filtered seropositive blood was infected. 1 infected infant died and 5 had clinical features consistent with CMV infection. The results show that transfusion-acquired CMV infection is preventable by filtration of blood through a leucocyte filter. This method has advantages over other methods of removing leucocytes or the use of only seronegative blood for newborn infants.\r"

The drugs were given in four equal daily doses for 7 days, except ceftriaxone which was given only once daily. 200 cases could be assessed; the causative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) in 146; meningococci (Mnc) in 32; pneumococci (Pnc) in 13; and other or unknown in 9. In patients with Hib meningitis, sterilisation of the cerebrospinal fluid occurred most rapidly with ceftriaxone. Otherwise, in terms of overall clinical recovery, normalisation of laboratory indices, clinically significant adverse reactions, toxic effects, sequelae, and mortality rate, the treatment groups were very similar. However, there were 4 bacteriological failures, all in the chloramphenicol group. Also, the treatment was extended or changed in more cases in the chloramphenicol group than in the other groups. Chloramphenicol was thus inferior to the other three antimicrobials. Ampicillin is a good and cheap alternative, but there are difficulties with resistance. Easy administration tempts the use of ceftriaxone rather than cefotaxime but it causes diarrhoea. A 7-day course of ampicillin, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone is sufficient in Hib, Mnc, or Pnc meningitis.\r"

Before randomisation the paired attacks were of similar severity with respect to urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) excretion and clinical manifestations. With haem arginate the median PBG excretion of the 9 patients with two attacks (normal range 0-16 mumol per 24 h) fell significantly from 332 mumol per 24 h (range 137-722) on admission to a median lowest level of 40 (range 22-105). On placebo, median PBG excretion was 382 (range 196-542) on admission, falling to 235 (range 128-427). Median duration of admission after the start of treatment was 11 days (range 2-28) for placebo and 8 days (3-26) for haem arginate. Median total analgesic requirement between the start of treatment and discharge was 8150 mg pethidine equivalents (range 0-17,650) with placebo versus 6425 (range 50-20,650) with haem arginate. Phlebitis occurred in 5 patients on haem arginate and in 2 on placebo. Haem arginate effectively reduces porphyrin precursor overproduction in the acute porphyric attack but this reduction is not accompanied by striking resolution of the clinical manifestations of the attack.\r"

  ".W": "Various mechanisms have been suggested to explain the high prevalence of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with heart failure, but as yet there is no unifying theory. There is growing evidence that changes in myocardial mechanical properties may directly alter cardiac electrophysiology by a process of mechanoelectric feedback. Moreover, when changes in cardiac loading similar to those seen in heart failure are produced experimentally in normal heart, there is a greater tendency to arrhythmogenesis. The intimate relation between changes in mechanical function and arrhythmia in heart failure could account for the lack of effect of most conventional antiarrhythmic drugs on arrhythmogenesis, and the beneficial effect of peripheral vasodilators. This paper argues that mechanically induced changes in electrophysiology are very important in the development of arrhythmia in cardiac failure; there may be no need to implicate other mechanisms, such as relative ischaemia, metabolic changes, or changes in sympathetic tone.\r"

This is especially true in children, who may be reluctant to receive intramuscular injections for pain relief and who may lose a higher percentage of total blood volume during surgery than adults. This study evaluated the effects of peritonsillar infiltration upon operative blood loss and postoperative pain in 42 children. For the purpose of infiltration, patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Children in groups I, II, and III had their peritonsillar infiltrations performed with the contents of a coded vial which contained bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine (1:200,000), normal saline with epinephrine (1:200,000), and normal saline, respectively. Group IV children (controls) received no infiltration. All solutions were prepared in the hospital pharmacy to assure binding of the operator and observer. All infiltrations were performed following the induction of general anesthesia and 5 minutes prior to the onset of surgery. Anesthetic agents, end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, and the administration of intravenous fluids were carefully regulated. Surgery was performed by one of two attending otolaryngologists or a senior otolaryngology fellow using the same dissection and snare technique. Hemostasis was managed by suction-electrocautery and packs. Patients in group IV, the control group, lost twice as much blood as did those who had infiltrations performed with normal saline, group III (p less than 0.001). However, patients in group III lost 1.5 times more blood than did those children in either of the two groups whose infiltrations were performed with an epinephrine solution, groups I and II (p less than 0.001). No postoperative bleeding was noted in any patient. Infiltration of the peritonsillar space with epinephrine (1:200,000) was shown to be more effective in reducing blood loss than infiltration with normal saline. Because of the small sample size we were unable to evaluate the beneficial effects of peritonsillar infiltration performed with bupivacaine upon the reduction of the severity of pain and the requirement for narcotic analgesics following tonsillectomy. Therefore, until further studies demonstrate such efficacy, all peritonsillar infiltrations should be performed solely for the purpose of reducing operative blood loss. As such, infiltrations should be performed with either normal saline containing epinephrine (1:200,000) or lidocaine containing epinephrine (1:200,000).\r"

Ten persons underwent nasal challenge with antigen after premedication with 20 mg of cetirizine or placebo QD for 2 days. The response was monitored by counting the number of sneezes and by measuring the levels of histamine, prostaglandin D2, leukotriene C4, albumin, and TAME-esterase activity in recovered nasal lavages. The results showed a significant reduction in sneezing and in the amounts of recovered albumin, TAME-esterase activity, and leukotriene C4 but no reduction in the amounts of recovered histamine and prostaglandin D2. These results suggest that cetirizine does not inhibit mast cell activation but inhibits the consequences of the released histamine on H1 receptors: sneezing and increased vascular permeability. The results further suggest that mast cell release of histamine is the direct result of antigen stimulation, as opposed to reflex activation, and that other cells in addition to mast cells generate leukotrienes during the early allergic response.\r"

  ".W": "Postherpetic pain persisting 1 month or longer occurs in only a small percentage of all patients with herpes zoster. In most patients, PHN tends to diminish with time. The incidence is, however, directly related to age. Any therapeutic claim for prophylaxis or treatment of PHN has to be evaluated with these observations in mind. There is some information about the pathologic features and a concept of the pathogenesis can be suggested. There is evidence for an imbalance in fiber input (reduced large, inhibitory fibers, and intact or increased small, excitatory fibers) to an abnormal dorsal horn that may contain hypersensitive neurons. Prevention of PHN remains difficult. There is evidence that systemic steroids exert a preventive effect when employed in the treatment of herpes zoster in the immunocompetent patient. A reasonable regimen is 60 mg of prednisone tapered over 10 to 14 days. One double-blind, controlled study supports the use of amantadine in this situation; this drug is an option in patients for whom steroids are contraindicated, such as those with peptic ulcer, diabetes mellitus or compromised immune function. The dosage of amantadine used in this study was 100 mg twice daily for a month. Although a number of other therapies have been suggested, these remedies remain in need of further, more scientific study. For established PHN, there is firm support for the reduction of pain from severe to mild in two thirds of patients administered low doses of amitriptyline followed by gradual, small increments. In the age group over 65 years, one may use as small a dose as 10 mg with an increase of 10 mg every 5 to 7 days. In those younger than 65, a dose of 25 mg to start is reasonable, with increments of 25 mg. Although unproved, the addition of a phenothiazine, such as fluphenazine, may provide further pain relief. Preliminary studies also indicate that topical capsaicin may be a useful new treatment. Although widely used, there is no good evidence for the use of anticonvulsants alone in this disorder. Studies of local anesthetic sprays with vibration and continuous TENS are uncontrolled, but these modalities may be of some merit. One uncontrolled study reported benefit from epidural steroids. DREZ lesions are a possibility in failed medical cases, but other surgical procedures appear to be of little or no use. Although the measures described here will benefit a number of patients, PHN remains an intractable problem in some cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Decreased blood flow in the residual limb is related to burning and tingling phantom and stump pain, whereas spasms in major muscles of the residual limb precede cramping phantom and stump pain. There is little support for psychological mechanisms underlying the vast majority of chronic phantom and stump pain problems, but these mechanisms can exacerbate both acute and chronic pain. It is critically important to educate patients about the process of amputation and the physiologic mechanisms of phantom sensation and pain in order to minimize magnification of pain due to stress. Acute stump pain usually responds well to traditional interventions based on identifying and correcting specific problems in the residual limb. Most traditional treatments for phantom pain and chronic stump pain are not effective for more than a few months. Recommended treatments are related to underlying mechanisms. For chronic phantom and stump pain, burning sensations are treated with interventions designed to increase blood flow to the residual limb, whereas cramping sensations are treated with interventions that reduce muscle spasms.\r"

In addition, treatment for neuropathic pain is often ineffective. Some degree of symptom control is often possible, however, through a multidisciplinary approach. This approach includes medications, physical treatments, and behavioral modifications. The limited understanding we have of the mechanisms of neuropathic pain is a strong reason to actively pursue further research into the pathophysiology of these conditions. Continued clinical and basic investigations into neuropathic pain also provide the best chance of finding treatments that are effective.\r"

Mitochondrial agents cause myofilament damage in saponin-skinned frog pectoris cutaneous muscle when [Ca] = 0. There are parallels with other systems that generate oxygen radicals. However, a variety of protectors against oxygen radicals, or anoxia, failed to protect; Ca-activated damage was not augmented by diethylthiocarbamate, nor was it accompanied by a respiratory burst. Thus, there is no firm evidence implicating oxygen radicals in myofilament damage. Thiol-oxidizing agents cause contraction damage in skinned muscle that resembles the quasirigor induced in myosin by N-ethylmaleimide. Activation of transmembrane dehydrogenases and electron flow produced damage and increased Ca sensitivity in skinned muscle, and it is suggested that this enzyme system may be implicated in characteristic damage to the myofilaments via redox cycling and modification of sulphydryl groups; its possible location on the sarcoplasmic reticulum is discussed.\r"

Secondary sensory endings were of an annulospiral, a flat, cuff-shaped, or a more complicated branched type; they were always completely surrounding intrafusal muscle fibers. Motor terminals were more focally arranged not surrounding the muscle fibers. Three types could be distinguished. Collagen fibrils were seen to insert on capsular elements as well as on the surface of intrafusal muscle fibers. Thus SEM helps understanding the most complicated electromechanical system for motor control.\r"

They are inflammatory-demyelinating diseases of the peripheral nervous system and likely have an immunologic pathogenesis. Although these neuropathies usually have a characteristic presentation, the electromyographer plays a central role in their recognition, since the demyelinating component of the neuropathy, which greatly reduces the differential diagnosis, is often first identified in the electromyography laboratory. In AIDP, the electromyographer, in addition to establishing the diagnosis, can sometimes predict the prognosis. Recognition of the chronic and dysproteinemic forms of acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy is important since they are treatable. The dysproteinemic forms also may be associated with occult systemic disorders that also may require treatment, independent of the neuropathy.\r"

Thirty-six preterm infants (birth weight, less than or equal to 1250 g and gestational age, less than or equal to 30 weeks) who were dependent on oxygen and mechanical ventilation at two weeks of age received a 42-day course of dexamethasone (n = 13), an 18-day course of dexamethasone (n = 12), or saline placebo (n = 11). The starting dose of dexamethasone was 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, and it was progressively lowered during the period of administration. Infants in the 42-day dexamethasone group, but not those in the 18-day group, were weaned from mechanical ventilation significantly faster than control infants (medians 29, 73, and 84 days, respectively; P less than 0.05), and from supplemental oxygen (medians 65, 190, and 136 days, respectively; P less than 0.05). No clinical complications of steroid administration were noted. Follow-up of all 23 survivors at 6 and 15 months of age showed good outcome (normal neurologic examinations and Bayley Developmental Indexes greater than or equal to 84) in 7 of the 9 infants in the 42-day dexamethasone group, but in only 2 of the 9 infants in the 18-day dexamethasone group and 2 of the 5 in the placebo group (P less than 0.05). We conclude that dexamethasone therapy for 42 days improves pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcome in very-low-birth-weight infants at high risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\r"

Twenty patients with spinal spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal-cord injury who had had no response to treatment with oral baclofen received an intrathecal infusion of baclofen or saline for three days. The infusions were administered by means of a programmable pump implanted in the lumbar subarachnoid space. Muscle tone decreased in all 20 patients (mean [+/- SD] Ashworth score for rigidity, from 4.0 +/- 1.0 to 1.2 +/- 0.4; P less than 0.0001), and spasms were decreased in 18 of the 19 patients who had spasms (mean [+/- SD] score for spasm frequency, from 3.3 +/- 1.2 to 0.4 +/- 0.8; P less than 0.0005). Tests for motor function, neurologic examination, and assessments by the patients correctly indicated when baclofen was being infused in all cases. All patients were then entered in an open long-term trial of continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen. During a mean follow-up period of 19.2 months (range, 10 to 33), muscle tone has been maintained within the normal range (mean Ashworth score, 1.0 +/- 0.1) and spasms have been reduced to a level that does not interfere with activities of daily living (mean spasm score, 0.3 +/- 0.6). No drowsiness or confusion occurred, one pump failed, and two catheters became dislodged and had to be replaced. No infections were observed. Our observations suggest that intrathecal baclofen is an effective long-term treatment for spinal spasticity that has not responded to oral baclofen.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital agranulocytosis is a disorder characterized by severe neutropenia and a profound deficiency of identifiable neutrophil progenitors in bone marrow. In an attempt to stimulate neutrophil production and thereby reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease, we administered recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in doses of 3 to 60 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day to five patients with congenital agranulocytosis. In all five patients, an increase in the number of neutrophils was noted eight to nine days after the initiation of the effective dosage (the dose at which the neutrophil count reached 1000 cells per microliter or more and the bone marrow showed granulocyte maturation beyond the myelocyte stage). The absolute neutrophil counts rose from less than 100 to between 1300 and 9500 cells per microliter. Marrow aspirates obtained after 14 days at the effective dosage showed maturation to the mature neutrophil stage. The side effects that were observed were medullary pain, splenomegaly, and an elevation of levels of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase. All five patients have had sustained neutrophil counts of 1000 cells per microliter or more for 9 to 13 months while receiving subcutaneous maintenance therapy. Preexisting chronic infections have resolved clinically, and the number of new infectious episodes and the requirement for intravenous antibiotics have decreased. We conclude that treatment with rhG-CSF can lead to a large increase in the numbers of functional neutrophils in patients with congenital agranulocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor in Plasmodium falciparum infections, we measured serum concentrations of this cytokine in 65 Malawian children with severe falciparum malaria. Of these children (mean age, 5.3 years), 55 were unconscious and 10 had hypoglycemia at presentation. Although there was considerable overlap, the mean (+/- SEM) initial serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor was significantly higher in the 10 patients who died (709 +/- 312 pg per milliliter) than in the 55 who survived (184 +/- 32 pg per milliliter; P less than 0.02). The mortality rate increased with the concentration of tumor necrosis factor: at a level of less than 100 pg per milliliter, 1 of 24 patients died; at 100 to 500 pg per milliliter, 6 of 34 patients; and at more than 500 pg per milliliter, 3 of 7 patients. High concentrations of tumor necrosis factor were also associated with hypoglycemia (P less than 0.02), hyperparasitemia (P less than 0.002), age under three years (P less than 0.03), and severity of illness as measured by a prognostic index (P less than 0.0005). The highest serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor were found in patients who died shortly after admission. The concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid were within the normal range in all patients. In serum samples obtained from 38 convalescent patients, the concentration of tumor necrosis factor declined to a mean of 16 +/- 3 pg per milliliter. We conclude that the level of tumor necrosis factor is frequently increased in patients with severe falciparum malaria, particularly in those with cerebral malaria or hypoglycemia. To determine whether it is important in the pathogenesis of the signs and symptoms of the disease requires further study.\r"

  ".W": "We performed a randomized, double-blind, controlled six-month trial of prednisone in 103 boys with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (age, 5 to 15 years). The patients were assigned to one of three regimens: prednisone, 0.75 mg per kilogram of body weight per day (n = 33); prednisone, 1.5 mg per kilogram per day (n = 34); or placebo (n = 36). The groups were initially comparable in all measures of muscle function. Both prednisone groups had significant improvement of similar degree in the summary scores of muscle strength and function. Improvement began as early as one month and peaked by three months. At six months the high-dose prednisone group, as compared with the placebo group, had improvement in the time needed to rise from a supine to a standing position (3.4 vs. 6.2 seconds), to walk 9 m (7.0 vs. 9.7 seconds), and to climb four stairs (4.0 vs. 7.1 seconds), in lifting a weight (2.1 vs. 1.2 kg), and in forced vital capacity (1.7 vs. 1.5 liters) (P less than 0.001 for all comparisons). There was an increase in urinary creatinine excretion (261 vs. 190 mg per 24 hours), which suggested an increase in total muscle mass. However, the prednisone-treated patients who had required long-leg braces (n = 5) or wheelchairs (n = 11) continued to require them. The most frequent side effects were weight gain, cushingoid appearance, and excessive hair growth. We conclude from this six-month study that prednisone improves the strength and function of patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. However, further research is required to identify the mechanisms responsible for these improvements and to determine whether prolonged treatment with corticosteroids may be warranted despite their side effects.\r"

  ".W": "Assessment of the risks of transmission of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from mother to newborn is difficult, partly because of the persistence for up to a year of maternal antibodies transmitted passively to the infant. To determine the frequency of perinatal transmission of HIV infection, we studied from birth 308 infants born to seropositive women, 62 percent of whom were intravenous drug abusers. Of 117 infants evaluated 18 months after birth, 32 (27 percent) were seropositive for HIV or had died of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (n = 6); of the 32, only 2 remained asymptomatic. Another 76 infants (65 percent) were seronegative and free of symptoms, whereas 9 (8 percent) were seronegative but had symptoms suggestive of HIV-1 infection. The infants infected with HIV-1 did not differ from the others at birth with respect to weight, height, head circumference, or rate of malformations, but as compared with newborns who were seronegative at 18 months, their serum IgM levels were higher (78 +/- 81 mg per deciliter vs. 38 +/- 39 mg per deciliter; P less than 0.03) and their CD4 lymphocyte counts were lower (2054 +/- 1221 per cubic millimeter vs. 2901 +/- 1195 per cubic millimeter; P less than 0.006). Neither maternal risk factors nor the route of delivery was a predictor of seropositivity at 18 months; however, 5 of the 6 infants who were breast-fed became seropositive, as compared with 25 of 99 who were not (P less than 0.01). We conclude that approximately one third of the infants born to seropositive mothers will have evidence of HIV-1 infection or of AIDS by the age of 18 months, and that about one fifth of this group will have died.\r"

All patients were being treated for various forms of leukemia or lymphoma. In 10 patients, granulocytes isolated from peripheral-blood samples obtained 28 to 159 days after transplantation were polyclonal. In some, circulating T cells were isolated and also found to be polyclonal. In contrast, two patients had donor-derived monoclonal or oligoclonal hematopoiesis after transplantation. In one, DNA from circulating mononuclear cells obtained 29 days after transplantation revealed a monoclonal pattern on analysis of a restriction-fragment-length polymorphism in the phosphoglycerate kinase gene. In the other, analysis of a restriction-fragment-length polymorphism in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene suggested the presence of a dominant clone in the granulocytes sampled 36 days after transplantation. When the latter patient was reassessed on day 267, the same clone of donor hematopoietic cells was still predominant and was found to include circulating T cells as well as granulocytes. We conclude that monoclonal hematopoiesis of donor origin may be observed in recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants, indicating that stem cells in normal adult human marrow are able to repopulate both lymphoid and myeloid compartments after transplantation.\r"

Recent experiments indicate that glutamate receptors also occur in astrocytes. We have used patch-clamp methods to determine whether one type of macroglial cell, the type-2 astrocyte, possesses glutamate receptors, as previously proposed from neurochemical studies. We find that glutamate and related amino acids can evoke whole-cell and single-channel currents in type-2 astrocytes from rat cerebellum. Although these cells are found mainly in white matter, where neurotransmission does not occur, their processes are closely associated with axons at nodes of Ranvier, suggesting that such receptors are involved in neuronal-glial signalling at the node. Our experiments show that glial cells possess quisqualate- and kainate-receptor channels but lack receptors for NMDA. Interestingly, these glutamate channels exhibit multiple conductance levels that are similar in amplitude to the neuronal glutamate channels.\r"

This transport process is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against NSF. Furthermore, pretreatment of semi-intact cells with N-ethylmaleimide, a sulphydryl alkylating reagent, inhibits transport. Addition of highly purified NSF largely restores transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi. These results suggest that NSF is a general component of the transport machinery required for membrane fusion at multiple stages of the secretory pathway.\r"

Many studies have indirectly suggested the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to be the site of InsP3 action, though some have implicated the plasma membrane or a newly described smooth surfaced structure, termed the calciosome. Using antibodies directed against a purified InsP3-receptor glycoprotein, of relative molecular mass 260,000, in electron microscope immunocytochemical studies of rat cerebellar Purkinje cells, we have now localized the InsP3 receptor to ER, including portions of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, a population of smooth-membrane-bound organelles (smooth ER), a portion of subplasmalemmal cisternae and the nuclear membrane, but not to mitochondria or the cell membrane. These results suggest that in cerebellar Purkinje cells, InsP3-induced intracellular calcium release is not the property of a single organelle, but is effected by specialized portions of both rough and smooth ER, and possibly by other smooth surfaced structures. The present findings are the first immunocytochemical demonstration of an InsP3 receptor within a cell.\r"

We have constructed an active-centre mutant of pro-subtilisin (Asp 32----Asn) which is not processed to active enzyme, unlike the wild-type pro-subtilisin, because intramolecular processing is prevented. Here we report an intermolecular pathway for the refolding of the inactive mature protein to an active enzyme in vitro with the aid of exogenously added pro-sequence. We establish conditions under which the mature inactive form, as well as acid-denatured subtilisins Carlsberg and BPN', can be renatured by the mutant pro-subtilisin.\r"

Spinal SEPs were abnormal in 10 patients. In 3 patients, SEPs detected abnormalities not seen on EMG examination. With 1 exception, all anatomic levels of SEP abnormalities matched that of radiographic, EMG, or clinical abnormalities. SEPs were abnormal in 41% of nerve roots shown to be involved by other techniques. SEPs added to the clinical evaluation in 4 patients, but were less accurate than a combination of EMG and radiography in indicating the extent of nerve root involvement. We conclude that spinal SEPs following segmental sensory stimulation are useful in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathies and complement information provided by the EMG. In contrast, scalp-recorded segmental SEPs rarely provide additional useful clinical information.\r"

Elevated CSF beta 2M was not due to CSF pleocytosis and was usually independent of blood-brain barrier dysfunction.\r"

These women reported significantly less pain than 42 control subjects (P less than .05 to P less than .0005). In the second phase of the study, a placebo gel was compared in a blind fashion with 20% benzocaine gel in 63 study subjects and 64 control women undergoing procedures similar to those in the first part of the study. The modal pain rating by both physician and patient was \"none\" in the study group for all procedures except endocervical curettage, for which the rating was \"mild\"; ratings were \"mild\" or \"moderate\" in the control group. Compliance with respect to keeping follow-up visits was significantly greater in the study group.

Serum magnesium concentration, angiotensin-converting enzyme concentration, and plasma renin activity were measured at uniform intervals in women with either preeclampsia or preterm labor. Plasma renin activity was significantly lower (3.9 +/- 2.2 versus 6.1 +/- 1.8 ng/mL/minute; P = .004) and angiotensin-converting enzyme significantly higher (47.1 +/- 14 versus 34.0 +/- 10 U/mL; P = .008) in women with preeclampsia than in those with preterm labor. Magnesium infusion was associated with a sustained decline in plasma renin activity in preeclamptic women (P = .003). A transient decline in angiotensin-converting enzyme (P = .009) was observed in women with preeclampsia, but not with preterm labor. In contrast to the sustained change in plasma renin activity, angiotensin-converting enzyme concentration returned to baseline activity levels by 2.5 hours. A nonsignificant negative relationship (P = .06) was noted between angiotensin-converting enzyme and gestational age in subjects with preeclampsia. We conclude that a short-term infusion of magnesium sulfate leads to a sustained decline in plasma renin activity in preeclamptic women, but exerts no sustained effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme in women with either preeclampsia or preterm labor.\r"

The reasons for this relate mainly to cost, availability, difficulty obtaining clear images because of fetal movement, and the convenience and utility of ultrasound. However, MRI use is expanding and has the potential to play an important role in selected problem pregnancies. We studied the pregnancies of five women whose fetuses showed anomalies by ultrasound. These included cases of a large body wall defect, a diaphragmatic hernia, hydrocephalus, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, and iniencephaly with a diaphragmatic hernia (the iniencephaly sequence). Three of these examinations followed fetal neuromuscular blockade, and two were associated with oligohydramnios without fetal paralysis. Paralysis provided superior images. The fetal central nervous system, subcutaneous tissue, and liver imaged particularly well. This study illustrates that MRI can enhance and even clarify certain information provided by ultrasound.\r"

A normal decline was observed in the umbilical artery S/D ratio, from 4.2 +/- 0.21 at 18 weeks to 2.18 +/- 0.22 at 38 weeks. There was no significant correlation between mean third-trimester S/D and either glycosylated hemoglobin (r = 0.25) or mean blood glucose levels (r = 0.15). Fetuses of women with vascular disease (class F/R or chronic hypertension) had a mean third-trimester S/D of 3.0 or higher in five of ten cases, compared with three of 25 in patients with uncomplicated diabetes (P less than .03). Mean second- and third-trimester S/D ratios differed significantly in patients with and without vascular disease: 4.34 +/- 0.7 and 3.2 +/- 0.65 versus 3.72 +/- 0.42 and 2.55 +/- 0.32, respectively (P less than .03). Two of three women without vascular disease who demonstrated an elevated mean S/D ratio developed preeclampsia and delivered appropriate for gestational age infants. In women with vascular disease, four of five with an abnormal mean third-trimester umbilical artery S/D ratio were delivered of growth-retarded infants, whereas all five with normal umbilical artery S/D ratios had appropriate for gestational age infants. In three of the abnormal cases, elevated S/D ratios were present in the second trimester before ultrasound documentation of fetal growth retardation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We tested the hypothesis by a preliminary investigation with group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, a common cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Our methods included suspension of isolated human umbilical vein segments in a 30-mL organ bath with modified Krebs solution, pH 7.3-7.4, under continuous aeration by 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37C. The vessels were attached to an isometric transducer which was connected to a polygraph. We tested Krebs solution, sterile culture medium, group B streptococcus spent medium, and washed whole group B streptococcus bacteria. Contractility was compared with results produced by 10(-5) M serotonin. The average contraction produced by 30 microL/mL group B streptococcus spent medium was 40.8% of that produced by serotonin. Whole washed bacteria produced 8.6% of the serotonin contraction. Krebs solution and sterile culture medium did not stimulate vascular contraction. Intraperitoneal injection of group B streptococcus spent medium in mice at four times the maximal experimental dose had little effect. Boiling group B streptococcus spent medium failed to affect its vasoactive stimulatory properties. We conclude that in vitro, group B streptococcus synthesizes a heat-stable, non-protein exotoxin that causes human umbilical vein contraction.\r"

By light microscopy the corneas showed sharp, unbeveled cut margins with nearly perfect apposition of the inner wound aspects. An elliptical shape may be better than a circular one, since the former closely approximates the cornea's normal elliptical outline, making it easier to fit corresponding areas of corneal graft to bed.

The specific example of an irradiated choroidal melanoma shows that the absence of echographic changes by no means excludes tumor destruction. Because of a dense vitreous body hemorrhage, the melanoma could only be evaluated echographically. Since the echogram lacked evidence of regression, the tumor was locally resected 5 months later. Histology, however, revealed an amorphous mass of dead tissue pervaded by intact vessels. Apparently a successfully irradiated melanoma may generate an echo typical of vital melanoma tissue. The authors therefore draw the conclusion that only a steady tumor growth, as substantiated by an echogram, may be considered an unambiguous sign of tumor vitality.\r"

Histologically, however, a junctional nevus may be indistinguishable from primary acquired melanosis (PAM) with atypia, a condition of middle-aged and elderly individuals that has a tendency to evolve into melanoma. Nevi in adolescents may attract a vigorous lymphocytic response and may cause clinical and histologic confusion with other entities, particularly a regressing nodule of melanoma that occurs predominantly in adults. Rarely, congenital conjunctival nevi are identified, sometimes in patients with adjacent congenital nevi of the eyelid. A variety of unusual nevi, including balloon-cell nevi, Spitz nevi, epithelioid cell nevi, dysplastic nevi, recurrent nevi, episcleral melanosis and the nevus of Ota, blue and cellular blue nevi, melanocytoma, and composite or mixed nevi all may be identified in the conjunctiva. Concepts of histogenesis as well as the clinical, light microscopic, and ultrastructural features of these and other benign pigmentary conditions of the conjunctiva are described.\r"

However, MR scanning is definitely superior to CT when evaluating for multiple sclerosis, posterior fossa lesions (evaluation of gaze palsies, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and downbeat nystagmus), or when assessing an area where sagittal scanning is important (chiasmal lesions). Magnetic resonance has increased specificity when the CT is equivocal. Although MR and CT may be complementary in the information they provide, many clinical studies have shown MR to be superior to CT in evaluating cerebral infarctions, hematomas, the intracanalicular optic nerve, optic chiasm, sella turcica, and the cavernous sinus. Magnetic resonance generally has replaced metrizamide CT cisternography as the procedure of choice for evaluating the suprasellar cistern and posterior fossa. Computed tomography is still preferable for major trauma, especially involving acute fractures and hematomas, although MR is more sensitive to the more subtle intracerebral lesions, such as shear injuries and subdural hematomas, that may provide prognostic information. Computed tomography also is preferred in situations where detecting small amounts of calcification is important for the differential diagnosis. As the development of MR imaging continues with faster scan times, finer spatial resolution, the use of paramagnetic contrast agents, and with increased availability and decreased cost, MR imaging may become preferable to CT as the imaging modality of choice for the CNS and orbit.\r"

The clinical and histologic features of HL are characteristic and distinctive. However, none of these features are entirely specific for HL, and we consider that the presence of EBV is required for diagnosis in questionable cases. EBV can be demonstrated by means of electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, or molecular biologic techniques. Therapy directed toward the HL lesion is sometimes indicated; acyclovir is the current drug of preference in such cases.\r"

A unique feature of HL is its localization to the lateral portion of the tongue. To determine site differences for EBV receptors according to epithelial phenotype, these receptors were mapped in oral mucosa with the use of monoclonal antibodies HB5 and B2(specific for the Complement Fraction 3d/EBV receptor on B lymphocytes). Immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence techniques were employed with the use of both cytologic suspensions and frozen tissue sections of oral epithelium. Pericellular plasma membrane immunoreactants were localized to upper spinous layer cells of the parakeratin phenotype; basal and parabasilar layers as well as all strata of orthokeratinized epithelia were negative. Those cells harboring EBV DNA as detected by in situ hybridization corresponded to cells with C3d/EBV receptors.\r"

The materials tested--Tubliseal, Diaket, AH26, Nogenol, Roth, and Endomethasone sealers--were placed in root canals with laterally condensed gutta-percha. The specimens were immediately immersed in blood or saline solution or kept dry for 2 hours. All the teeth were then subjected to methylene blue dye for 1 hour. A comparison of the seal was made by observation of dye penetration around the filling materials. Under all conditions, Tubliseal exhibited the least amount of marginal penetration, followed by AH 26. There was no significant difference in the depth of dye penetration between Diaket and Tubliseal in dry and wet conditions. Although AH 26, Nogenol, Roth, and Endomethasone sealers showed comparable sealing ability under dry conditions, the sealing ability of AH 26 and Diaket was superior to that of Nogenol, Roth, and Endomethasone sealers in moisture contamination. A significant drop in the seals afforded by AH26, Diaket, Roth, and Endomethasone sealers was recorded when these materials were immersed in blood. On the other hand, immersion in blood caused no significant change in the sealing ability of Nogenol.\r"

  ".W": "When properly recorded and interpreted, the auditory brainstem response (ABR) serves as a powerful, noninvasive tool for the diagnosis of pediatric auditory disorders. The detection of eighth cranial nerve and brainstem dysfunction relies primarily on the comparison of wave latencies to normative data and between ears of the same patient. The description of peripheral hearing sensitivity thresholds by ABR relies primarily on the determination of the weakest stimulus intensity at which the ABR can be elicited. Differential diagnosis of sensorineural versus conductive loss is assisted by analysis of latency-intensity relationships and by bone-conducted ABR findings, whereas description of the frequency contour of the audiogram is possible using band-limited tone burst stimuli as well as other methods. From the caveats and case examples reported here, it should be clear that the ABR cannot be measured or interpreted from a patient in a \"black box\" fashion. Suprathreshold ABR recordings for neurotologic analysis are influenced by cochlear dysfunction, which can affect both absolute and interpeak wave latencies, and by conductive hearing loss, which affects absolute wave latencies, in such a way that the patient's audiogram must be known for proper test administration and interpretation. Interpretation of suprathreshold ABR data to infer hearing threshold sensitivity has extremely limited utility and can \"clear\" a child who indeed has substantial hearing loss. Threshold ABR recordings represent the most accurate means available to estimate the audiogram in the very young infant or difficult-to-test child, yet can be influenced by retrocochlear dysfunction, and require concurrent knowledge of outer and middle ear status as well as careful interpretive statements of the actual frequency range for which the audiogram has been estimated. The diagnosis of hearing impairment by ABR in a child is accomplished best when it is performed in the context of concurrent audiologic and otologic workups, with availability (on site or by referral) of a team of hearing health care professionals to evaluate and support the whole child and family. In the case of a newly diagnosed significant hearing impairment in an infant or toddler, input is needed from various professionals including those involved in education of the hearing-impaired, speech-language pathology, developmental psychology, social service, genetics, and ophthalmology, as well as the primary care pediatrician.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Indirect assessment procedures, such as airflow studies, do not enhance the decision making process even though they may provide what would appear to be objective data. Treatment decisions depend on the ability to confirm the type of speech abnormality present (by behavioral assessment) followed by a direct view of the defect (by endoscopy and fluoroscopy).\r"

The most common cause of nighttime obstruction with or without apnea is hyperplasia of the tonsils and adenoids. Other conditions such as craniofacial anomalies and neuromuscular disorders may predispose children to obstruction of the airway during sleep. Although cor pulmonale, heart failure, and cardiorespiratory arrest are the most dramatic results of obstructive apnea, before these occur many other problems may develop that are detrimental to the child's health, including failure to thrive. A careful history and physical examination are usually sufficient to determine if obstruction and apnea are present at night. Additional studies such as sleep sonography and polysomnography are helpful for documentation of the disorder. The treatment of obstructive apnea, unless associated with central apnea, is surgical. The vast majority of children with obstruction have dramatic resolution of their obstruction following a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. Occasionally additional procedures including uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and tracheotomy are needed.\r"

  ".W": "The information presented in this article demonstrates that unilateral or bilateral vocal cord paresis or paralysis in infants and children is difficult to diagnose and difficult to manage. In an attempt to provide the otolaryngologist with a concise set of relevant guidelines, the following rules for management are presented here. 1. Suspect bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis (BAVP) when a neonate or infant presents with high-pitched inspiratory stridor and evidence of airway compromise. Factors that should increase the suspicion of BAVP include associated Arnold-Chiari malformation; congenital anatomic abnormality involving the mediastinum (for example, tracheoesophageal fistula, vascular ring, other vascular anomalies); dysmorphic syndromes, especially those involving brainstem dysfunction; and manifest findings indicative of neuromuscular disorder. The neonate or infant with Arnold-Chiari malformation and inspiratory stridor has bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis until proven otherwise. 2. Suspect unilateral vocal cord paresis or paralysis in an infant or child with hoarse voice, low-pitched cry, or breathy cry or voice. The infant who develops mild stridor and hoarse cry following surgical repair of a patent ductus arteriosus or tracheoesophageal fistula has a unilateral vocal cord paralysis until proven otherwise. 3. Direct laryngoscopy with the flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscope and photodocumentation using a videocassette recorder offers the best method for diagnosis of vocal cord paresis or paralysis. Additional diagnostic studies that may be helpful include radiographic studies, CT scan, MRI scan, electromyography of the larynx, and, in older children, stroboscopy. 4. In using a flexible direct laryngoscope be careful not to interpret all motions of the vocal cords or arytenoids as evidence to preclude the diagnosis of vocal cord paralysis or paresis and be careful not to mistake the anterior intraluminal portion of a normal cricoid for an \"anterior glottic web.\" 5. Tracheotomy is often required in order to assure adequate airway during infancy for children with BAVP. However, with the advent of sophisticated cardiorespiratory monitoring equipment and methods for monitoring blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, tracheotomy can be delayed until attempts have been made to improve the adequacy of the airway with neurosurgical intervention or other procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This effect was maximally evoked by oscillating but not continuous stimulation applied to a dermatome corresponding to the levels of spinal cord acted upon by the intrathecal antagonist. Similar results were observed in chloralose-urethane anesthetized rats in which tactile stimulation evoked hypertensive responses following local tactile stimuli. The effects were only mildly depressed by even high doses of spinal morphine or DADL and not at all by ST-91 or baclofen. In contrast, intrathecal injections of glutamate receptor antagonists resulted in a dose-dependent depression of the strychnine evoked hyperesthesia with the ordering of activity being MK-801, AP-5, kynurenic acid, SKF10047 and ketamine. At doses below those which produced motor dysfunction, however, these agents had no effects on the hot-plate response latency. These data emphasize that low threshold afferent input is likely subject to an ongoing modulation, the loss of which results in a miscoding of the afferent stimulus yielding a pain relevant message. The lack of effect of agents having a powerful effect on somatic pain stimuli and the converse effects of glutamate receptor antagonists on the strychnine hyperesthesia at doses which do not affect the somatic pain response indicate discriminable processing systems, the characteristics of which resemble the clinical phenomenon observed in patients suffering from sensory dysesthesia following central and peripheral horn injury.\r"

Tubular proteinuria was assessed in 14 children by monitoring the excretion of total urinary protein and two other sensitive indicators of nephrotoxicity, the renal tubular enzymes N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and alanine aminopeptidase, in sequential 8-hour urine collections during 7 days of antimicrobial therapy. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in excretion of the three marker proteins when values were compared on any day of therapy or for the entire 7-day course. Nor did we observe any significant changes in either serum creatinine concentrations or amikacin clearance rates in the larger study group of 101 children from which these patients were drawn. Although amikacin was subclinically nephrotoxic, the addition of vancomycin to amikacin therapy did not enhance clinical or tubular nephrotoxicity in these children.\r"

The gestational age (mean +/- SD) was 25.9 +/- 1.3 weeks and body weight was 769.2 +/- 151.5 g at the time of initiation of the study. Vancomycin was infused over a period of 60 minutes in a dosage of 14.2 +/- 3.2 mg/kg once daily in 10 patients, twice daily in 1 patient and every 36 hours in 1 patient for a mean of 10.5 +/- 4.9 days. Serial blood samples were obtained and the concentration time data were fitted to a one-compartment open model using the ADAPT computer program. A significant positive correlation was found between postconceptional age and vancomycin clearance (P less than 0.005) and between vancomycin elimination half-life and plasma creatinine (P less than 0.01). A negative correlation existed between plasma creatinine and vancomycin clearance (P less than 0.005), between postconceptional age and plasma creatinine (P less than 0.005) and between vancomycin half-life and postconceptional age (P less than 0.01). On the basis of these findings a vancomycin dosage of 15 mg/kg every 24 hours for infants less than 1000 g should yield concentrations within the accepted therapeutic range. This susceptible population requires frequent monitoring of vancomycin concentrations because of the high degree of interpatient variability and the continuous maturation of renal function.\r"

In contrast to 1984 rapid rotavirus antigen testing by latex agglutination of stool from patients with diarrhea was instituted in 1986, in addition to testing for rotavirus by enzyme immunoassay, to determine whether use of rapid antigen testing resulted in an increased incidence of appropriate isolation and a decrease in nosocomial infections. In 1986 rapid identification of rotavirus resulted in an increase in hospitalization of rotavirus-infected patients in single bed rooms from 68% to 100% (P = 0.02, chi square test) but no significant increase in the use of enteric precautions for these patients. The total number of cases of nosocomial rotavirus infection in the two periods did not differ. In both periods 11 cases occurred; the nosocomial infection rate in 1984 was 18.9 cases/1000 days of exposure whereas in 1986 it was 20.2 cases/1000 days. These findings indicate that the use of rapid rotavirus antigen testing of patients with diarrhea is not of appreciable benefit in preventing the nosocomial spread of rotavirus to infants on the ward.\r"

The annual incidence rate among children younger than 5 years of age was 52/100,000; 46% of patients had meningitis, 29% had epiglottitis and 25% had other forms of invasive disease. The median age of patients was 27 months, with 45% younger than 2 years of age. Meningitis and epiglottitis were found more often among boys than among girls, whereas the opposite was found among patients with other types of invasive disease (P = 0.015). Among the latter 68% of children with pneumonia or septicemia were 2 years or older compared with 32% of patients with arthritis, cellulitis or pyelonephritis (P = 0.009). These background data are essential for correct interpretation and application of results from trials with H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines that are currently ongoing in Finland.\r"

If it is assumed that entry into the central half of the vein will result in successful catheterization, successive attempts 5 mm and 6 mm medial to the pulse would result in cumulative successful insertion in 53% and 61%, respectively, with no arterial punctures. A third attempt 4 mm medial to the pulse further increases cumulative success to 78%, but 3% arterial punctures would occur. These guidelines are intended to facilitate achievement of femoral venous catheterization, minimizing arterial punctures and number of needle passes required.\r"

  ".W": "As part of a prospective national survey of preterm and small for gestational age infants in the Netherlands, the relationship between maximal serum total bilirubin concentration in the neonatal period and neurodevelopmental outcome at the corrected age of 2 years was studied. Initially, 1,338 infants with a gestational age of less than 32 completed weeks and/or a birth weight of less than 1,500 g were enrolled in the study; 146 were subsequently excluded because of congenital malformations and 361 died during the study period. At the corrected age of 2 years, 831 children were available for follow-up. Children with minor and major handicaps had significantly greater maximal serum total bilirubin concentrations than children with a normal neurodevelopmental outcome (P = .02). A consistent increase in prevalence of handicaps was found for each 50-mumol/L (2.9 mg/dL) increase of maximal serum total bilirubin concentration. The handicaps consisted mainly of cerebral palsy. Logistic regression analysis involving seven suspected confounding factors (gestational age, birth weight, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, respiratory distress syndrome, ventriculomegaly, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia) revealed that the odds ratio was 1.3. This indicates that, on a multiplicative scale, the risk of a handicap increased by 30% for each 50-mumol/L (2.9 mg/dL) increase of maximal serum total bilirubin concentration (P = .02). Further analysis treated bilirubin as a categorized exposure. A striking systematic increase was found, suggesting a causal relationship between maximal serum total bilirubin concentration and neurodevelopmental outcome.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a continuous infusion of low-dose urokinase (200 U/kg/h) in clearing catheters that had not cleared after two bolus doses of urokinase in a pediatric oncology population. Fifty-eight incidents of catheter-related occlusions (49 Hickman-type catheters/nine implantable ports) as documented by radiographic dye study occurred in 227 pediatric oncology patients with 254 central venous catheters during a 1-year period. Fourteen of 58 catheters failed to clear after two bolus instillations of urokinase (5,000 U and 10,000 U). Thirteen catheters were treated for 24 hours with urokinase, 200 U/kg/h, and one catheter with urokinase, 100 U/kg/h for 24 hours. Twelve catheters were used for study. Coagulation studies were monitored preinfusion, 12 hours into the infusion, and postinfusion. Patency was reestablished in 11/12 catheters (92%) with a mean infusion time of 28.7 hours. No coagulation abnormalities or clinical bleeding associated with the urokinase infusion occurred. Only one patient exhibited a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (greater than 150 seconds); this was associated with a heparin effect. These data indicate that low-dose urokinase may be a safe and effective means to clear occluded central venous catheters in children.\r"

Characteristics of these neonates were as follows: (1) they were full term by obstetric and neonatal criteria, (2) they had diffuse bilateral alveolar opacification on chest radiographs during the acute illness, (3) each had an acute perinatal triggering insult, (4) the neonates required continuous positive pressure ventilation for at least 48 hours with FiO2 greater than 0.50 for at least 12 hours, (5) they needed positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cm of H2O or greater within three days of the triggering event, (6) there were no other known causes of these clinical conditions. Ten (91%) neonates had evidence of other organ dysfunction in addition to the lungs. Trials of hyperventilation in nine and tolazoline in five failed to improve oxygenation. Ten infants who underwent trials of increased positive end-expiratory pressure greater than or equal to 6 cm of H2O without other concurrent changes in ventilator settings responded with prompt increases in PaO2 (median increase 84 mm Hg, range 22 to 196 mm Hg). All 11 babies survived but required prolonged mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen. We suggest that adult respiratory distress syndrome can and does occur in newborns. A trial of positive end-expiratory pressure greater than or equal to 6 cm of H2O should be considered in full-term infants with severe respiratory distress in whom other causes can be excluded.\r"

In all seven children, despite their normal neurologic status, tethered spinal cords were diagnosed. All children had operations, which confirmed this finding. None had postoperative neurologic deficits. Infants and children with similar lumbar cutaneous hemangiomas should have magnetic resonance scans to detect the presence of tethered spinal cords.\r"

All of the patients responded to glucocorticoids; two were also treated with colchicine and one was treated with chlorambucil. In two patients, follow-up of more than 10 years was done, with complete cure in one patient and benign course of illness in the other.

The child had progressive macrocephaly, noted at 6 months of age, which preceded the rapid acceleration of linear growth by nearly 1 year. At 21 months of age, the girl's head circumference measured 55 cm (+5.5 SD) and her height was 97.6 cm (+4.4 SD). Preoperative serum growth hormone level was 135 ng/mL, somatomedin C was 1,540 ng/mL (normal for bone age 18 to 97 ng/mL), and prolactin was 370 ng/mL (normal less than 20 ng/mL). Following total resection of a large adenoma, immunohistochemical staining of the tumor showed growth hormone but not prolactin. With longitudinal monitoring of the child for 2 years postoperatively, persistently low growth hormone levels were demonstrated and normal growth velocity (6 cm/yr). Peak serum growth hormone levels ranged from 2.8 to 4.1 ng/mL after stimulation tests with insulin, arginine, and L-dopa. Maximum sleep-entrained growth hormone level was 3.4 ng/mL. At the same time, serum somatomedin C levels measured serially were normal (29 to 111 ng/mL), whereas simultaneous prolactin levels were moderately increased (30 to 147 ng/mL). The data support the hypothesis that hyperprolactinemia may have contributed to stimulating somatomedin C and sustaining the normal growth rate in this child.\r"

While it was an important part of early nursing education, it nearly disappeared from the nursing curriculum during the 1950s and 1960s. The traditional method of ethics teaching, the Scientific Model, is no longer used in nursing education. However, the contemporary models of ethics teaching--the Moral Concepts Model, the Moral Issues Model, the Clinical Practice Model, and the Ethics Inquiry Model--are being implemented into baccalaureate, graduate, and doctoral education in nursing. Having different goals and employing different teaching methods, these models promise to achieve the overall goal for teaching ethics to nurses: to produce a morally accountable practitioner who is skilled in ethical decision making. The uses of these model are encouraged in all aspects of nursing education, regardless of type of curriculum and faculty preparation to teach ethics. Given the availability of ethics resources and faculty seminars/workshops on ethics teaching strategies, all or part of any of the models can be easily implemented in the majority of nursing education programs.\r"

It is the art-science that critically evaluates the \"is.\" As such, ethics identifies the norms or standards of behaviors that either are or can become the values that are implemented through moral reasoning. Nursing is just beginning to identify its moral values and reasoning. Nevertheless, nursing seems to be further along in the identification of the \"is\" than it is with the \"ought.\" The further development of nursing ethics will be of great benefit to nurse researchers and educators. The greatest benefit will be, however, to the practicing nurse as she/he struggles with giving excellent nursing care consistent with a positive nursing ethic.\r"

As we consider whether or not our conduct toward persons who are HIV infected is right, however, many unanswered questions still exist. All health care professionals must be involved in reflection, re-examination of values, and ethical analysis of our behaviors. Nurses have an obligation to be informed about HIV infection, its clinical manifestations, treatments, and the care of affected persons. We must help our patients to know their needs and their options. We must listen to them. We must advocate for them. It has been said that nurses caring for patients with AIDS require two dominant characteristics: courage and impartiality. They need courage to face risks and impartiality to temper prejudice. In addition to these characteristics, nurses need a strong sense of caring, compassion for fellow human beings, and a conviction that they can make a difference in promoting a person's welfare and preserving his or her dignity.\r"

Each of these features can be enhanced by appropriate involvement of the nurse on an ethics committee. As a result, the nurse will be helping to assure patient, family, and professional participants that they have done their best under difficult constraints. Serving as a member of a hospital ethics committee is time consuming and challenging. Yet, it is one of the most important ways nurses can function in the role of patient advocate. The ethics committee can be the answer to the frustration that nurses confront every day when faced with increased technology, legislative inaction, and medical paternalism. Even competent patients are often manipulated when they want to refuse treatment. Patients and families frequently have the illusion of choice but no real choice at all. If an ethics committee can provide some meaningful avenue for the exercise of patients' and families' rights, then they are worth the effort.\r"

Like them, oxyR appears to be negatively autoregulated: an oxyR::lacZ gene fusion produced 5-fold higher levels of beta-galactosidase activity in oxyR null mutants compared to oxyR+ controls, and extracts from an OxyR-overproducing strain were able to protect regions (-27 to +21) of the oxyR promoter from DNase I digestion. DNA sequence analysis of the oxyR2 mutation, which causes overexpression of oxyR-regulated proteins in the absence of oxidative stress, showed that the oxyR2 phenotype is due to a missense mutation (C.G to T.A transition) that changes alanine to valine at amino acid position 234 of OxyR.\r"

Although the vaccinia gene encoding the topoisomerase is essential for virus growth, the role of the enzyme in vivo remains unclear. In the present study, the physiologic consequences of vaccinia topoisomerase action have been examined in a heterologous system, Escherichia coli. The vaccinia topoisomerase gene was inducibly expressed in an int-lambda lysogen BL21(DE3) using a T7 RNA polymerase-based transcription system. Expression of active topoisomerase in this context resulted in recA-dependent lysogenic induction as well as cell lysis. Surprisingly, topoisomerase expression also effected a 200-fold increase in the titer of infectious lambda phage, apparently by promoting int-independent prophage excision. This effect was not observed during lysogenic induction with nalidixic acid. Restriction analysis of genomic DNA from plaque-purified excisants revealed (in 10 of 10 cases) gross alterations of the DNA structure around the att site relative to the structure of the parental phage DE3. It is construed therefore that vaccinia DNA topoisomerase I acts to promote illegitimate recombination in E. coli.\r"

We demonstrate that protein synthesis of P.69 is under genetic control of the vir locus. Using oligonucleotide probes derived from the protein sequence of a cyanogen bromide fragment, we have cloned the gene for P.69 from B. pertussis CN2992. Analysis of the DNA sequence reveals a G + C-rich gene capable of encoding a protein of 910 amino acids with a Mr of 93,478, suggesting that P.69 is a processed form of a larger precursor. In common with some of the genes in the pertussis toxin operon, the sequence CCTGG was found 5' to the ATG initiation codon. At the 3' end, 29 bases after the TAA stop codon, the sequence GTTTTTCCT was found and may have some function in transcription termination. A full-length clone of the gene for P.69 carried by the cosmid pBPI69 was unable to direct the expression of P.69 protein in an Escherichia coli host. The generation of P.69-fusion products allowed the detection of P.69-specific protein products synthesized in E. coli.\r"

Site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned yeast TOP1 gene encoding the enzyme confirms the essentiality of Tyr-727 for the relaxation of supercoiled DNA by the enzyme. From amino acid sequence homology, Tyr-771 and -773 are readily identified as the active site tyrosines of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and human DNA topoisomerase I, respectively. Sequence comparison and site-directed mutagenesis also implicate Tyr-274 of vaccinia virus DNA topoisomerase as the active site residue. There appears to be a 70-amino acid domain near the carboxyl terminus of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I and vaccinia topoisomerase, within which the active site tyrosine resides.\r"

Arg-200 was replaced by each of the other 19 naturally occurring amino acids, and the mutant endonucleases were assessed for activities in vivo and in vitro. The mutant endonuclease with lysine at position 200 exhibits the most in vivo activity of all the position 200 mutants, although the in vitro activity is less than 1/100th of wild-type activity. Five other mutants show more drastically reduced levels of in vivo activity (Cys, Pro, Val, Ser, and Trp). The Cys, Val, and Ser mutant enzymes appear to have in vivo activity which is specific for the wild-type canonical site despite the loss of hydrogen bonding potential at position 200. The Pro and Trp mutants retain in vivo activity which is independent of the presence of the EcoRI methylase. In crude cell lysates, only the Cys mutant shows a very low level of in vitro activity. None of the mutant enzymes show a preference for alternative sites in assays in vitro. The implications of these results are discussed.\r"

Previous experiments have implicated E2F in the E1A-dependent transactivation of the E2 gene since levels of active E2F increase markedly during adenovirus infection in parallel with the increase in E2 transcription, and an E2F binding site can confer E1A inducibility to a heterologous promoter. Here we show that E2F binds to two sequence elements within the P2 promoter of the human MYC gene which are within a region that is critical for promoter activity. The MYC promoter can be trans-activated in an E1A-dependent manner and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that these E2F elements are essential for trans-activation. Finally, we also find that adenovirus infection of quiescent cells results in a stimulation of the endogenous MYC gene. We conclude that the activation of the E2F factor, which is likely responsible for the activation of viral E2 transcription, is also responsible for the E1A-dependent induction of MYC transcription.\r"

The number of repeats ranges from 26 in yeast to 42 in Drosophila to 52 in mouse. The CTD is essential in vivo, but its structure and function are not yet understood. The CTD can be phosphorylated at multiple serine and threonine residues, generating a form of the largest subunit (II0) with markedly reduced mobility in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels. To investigate this extensive phosphorylation, which presumably modulates functional properties of RNA polymerase II, we began efforts to purify a specific CTD kinase. Using CTD-containing fusion proteins as substrates, we have purified a CTD kinase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme extensively phosphorylates the CTD portion of both the fusion proteins and intact subunit IIa, producing products with reduced electrophoretic mobilities. The properties of the CTD kinase suggest that it is distinct from previously described protein kinases. Analogous activities were also detected in Drosophila and HeLa cell extracts.\r"

Transcription from the conII derivatives in the absence of repression interferes with the phenotypic expression of an adjacent drug-resistance gene, aadA. Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins are shown to repress these promoters and alleviate transcriptional interference of aadA, resulting in drug resistance in cells expressing the appropriate DNA-binding protein.\r"

  ".W": "Chromosome I is the smallest chromosome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and contains a DNA molecule that is only 250 kilobases (kb). Approximately 75% of this DNA molecule has been cloned. A restriction map for the entire DNA molecule from chromosome I was determined and most of its genetically mapped genes were located on this physical map. Based on the average rate of recombination (centimorgans/kb) found for other S. cerevisiae chromosomes, the outermost markers on the genetic map of chromosome I were expected to be close to the ends of the DNA molecule. While the rightmost genetic marker was 3 kb from the end, the leftmost marker, CDC24, was located near the middle of the left arm, suggesting that the genetic map would be much longer. To extend the genetic map, a copy of the S. cerevisiae URA3 gene was integrated in the outermost cloned region located 32 kb centromere distal to CDC24, and the genetic map distance between these two genes was determined. The new marker substantially increased the genetic map length of chromosome I. In addition, we determined the relationship between physical and genetic map distance along most of the length of the chromosome. Consistent with the longer genetic map, the average rate of recombination between markers on chromosome I was greater than 50% higher than the average found on other yeast chromosomes. Owing to its small size, it had been estimated that approximately 5% of the chromosome I homologues failed to undergo meiotic recombination. New measurements of the zero-crossover class indicated that the enhanced rate of recombination ensures at least one genetic exchange between virtually every pair of chromosome I homologues.\r"

This effect is over and above that contributed by nonrandomness in the use of amino acid pairs, which itself is highly evident; it is much weaker when nonadjacent codon pairs are examined and virtually disappears when pairs separated by two or three intervening codons are evaluated. There appears to be a high degree of directionality in this bias: any codon that participates in many nonrandom pairs tends to make both over- and underrepresented pairs, but preferentially as a left- or right-hand member. We show a relationship between codon-pair utilization patterns and levels of gene expression: genes encoding proteins expressed at high levels tend to contain more abundant, but more highly underrepresented, codon pairs, relative to genes expressed at low levels. The nonrandom utilization of codon pairs may be a consequence of their effects on translational efficiency, which in turn may be related to the compatibility of adjacent aminoacyl-tRNA isoacceptors at the A and P sites of a translating ribosome.\r"

Using a panel of chromosome-1-specific DNA probes that identify restriction fragment length polymorphisms, we demonstrate that 13 of 47 human neuroblastomas (28%) have somatic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at one or more loci on the distal short arm of chromosome 1. the chromosomal region that shows LOH most consistently is between 1p36.1 and 1p36.3; loss of a gene or genes in this region may be critical for the development or progression of neuroblastomas. The region of LOH in human neuroblastoma may resemble that described for pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and melanoma, which are also tumors of neural-crest origin. Although LOH for distal chromosome 1p can occur in early stages of neuroblastoma, the loss usually occurs in tumors of advanced clinical stages. LOH for the short arm of chromosome 1 correlates significantly with N-myc amplification, suggesting that these two genetic events are related. Indeed, these two lesions appear to characterize a genetically distinct subset of particularly aggressive neuroblastomas.\r"

Administration of zinc enhanced transgene expression in liver, kidney and exocrine pancreas. No evidence suggestive of an autoimmune response was found in transgene-expressing tissues in mice otherwise allogeneic to H-2Kb. Despite this lack of responsiveness in vivo, T cells could be stimulated in vitro to lyse H-2Kb-bearing target cells. No infiltration was detected in transgenic mice after irradiation and reconstitution with bone marrow cells. When spleen cells were used for reconstitution, however, dense lymphocytic infiltration was seen, particularly in the portal tracts of the liver, and this was accompanied by piecemeal necrosis and apoptosis of periportal hepatocytes. This aggressive response progressively diminished with time, and by 12 weeks after reconstitution many of the portal tracts were free of infiltration while the others showed no accompanying necrosis. The picture at this stage was similar to that seen in chronic persistent hepatitis. These results suggest that, in addition to negative selection in the thymus, peripheral mechanisms not involving clonal deletion or permanent clonal anergy can prevent immune responses to self molecules.\r"

In a perfusion set-up, the extracellular matrix from IIB cells supported platelet adhesion similarly to the matrix from normal cells. vWF secreted constitutively by IIB cells into the culture medium bound to platelets at concentrations of ristocetin lower than those necessary for vWF from normal cells. vWF stored in the Weibel-Palade bodies of type IIB cells was released upon stimulation with phorbol ester and bound almost completely to platelets even in the absence of ristocetin. Moreover, spontaneous platelet aggregation was induced by vWF synthesized by type IIB cells. These data support the hypothesis that the absence of highly multimeric forms of vWF in plasma of type IIB von Willebrand disease patients is due to specific removal of these multimers by platelets.\r"

We have, therefore, investigated the regulation of these proteins in (i) hypophysectomized (hypox) rats infused with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) or recombinant human IGF 1 (rhIGF I) and (ii) streptozotocin-diabetic rats infused with insulin or rhIGF I. The main carrier protein, a GH-dependent complex of apparent molecular mass 200 kDa, contains N-glycosylated IGF-binding subunits (42, 45, and 49 kDa) that differ in their glycosyl but not in their protein moiety. These subunits are lacking in hypox and diabetic rats. They are induced by GH and insulin, respectively, and appear in the 200-kDa complex. Infusion of rhIGF I induces the subunits in both states; however, only in diabetic, not in hypox, rats do they form the 200-kDa complex. Glycosylated carrier protein subunits do not appear before 8 hr of rhIGF I infusion. During that period, hypox rats may become severely hypoglycemic. After 16 hr, glycosylated subunits are clearly induced, and blood sugar values are normal. We conclude: (i) The N-glycosylated subunits of the 200-kDa complex reflect the IGF I status. (ii) IGF I may mediate the induction of these subunits by GH. (iii) Significant association to the 200-kDa complex occurs only in the presence of GH. It is likely that GH, but not IGF I, induces a component, which itself does not bind IGF, but associates with the glycosylated IGF-binding subunits. (iv) The glycosylated subunits protect against IGF-induced hypoglycemia and may be involved in tissue-specific targeting of IGFs.\r"

One of these peptides reacted with IgA antibodies present in sera from 24 of 33 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical carcinoma, whereas this peptide reacted with only 6 of 27 sera from individuals without cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Immunoaffinity-purified human antipeptide IgA antibodies detected HPV-specific 58- and 48-kDa proteins in cervical carcinoma cell extracts and also detected a nuclear antigen in HPV-carrying cervical cancer cell lines and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia biopsied tissue. These antigens were also detected with mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the same peptide. The results indicate that screening for infection with malignancy-associated types of HPV may be possible by simple synthetic peptide-based serology.\r"

Shigella is a nonmotile microorganism that appears to utilize host cell microfilaments to generate intra- as well as intercellular movements, since this movement was inhibited by cytochalasin D and involvement of F-actin was demonstrated by direct labeling of infected cells with the specific dye N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)phallacidin. Such movements led to the formation of extracellular protrusions, which may explain cell to cell spread. icsA, a locus necessary for intra- and intercellular spread, was identified on the Shigella flexneri virulence plasmid pWR100. This locus was cloned and shown to express a 120-kDa outer membrane protein, which plays an important role in the interactions established between host cell microfilaments and the bacterial surface, thus leading to intracellular movement.\r"

Here we provide evidence that endothelin activates the dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel in porcine coronary artery smooth muscle. The vasoconstrictor action of endothelin is efficiently antagonized by low doses of the dihydropyridine Ca2+-channel blocker nicardipine. Endothelin augments the Ca2+-induced contraction in a high-K+ depolarizing solution, markedly enhances high-threshold Ca2+-channel current on the whole-cell patch clamp recording, and causes a sustained increase in the intracellular Ca2+ that is largely dependent on extracellular Ca2+. These findings suggest that endothelin exerts its vasoconstrictor effect by either directly or indirectly activating the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel.\r"

With the aid of the cloned mutT gene, the MutT protein, which has a molecular mass of 15 kilodaltons, was overproduced and purified to near homogeneity. The protein catalyzes hydrolysis of dGTP to dGMP. dGDP and GTP were also hydrolyzed by the protein, but at a lower rate than seen with dGTP. No other deoxynucleoside triphosphates were hydrolyzed. Using poly(dA).(dT)20 as a template-primer, we investigated the misincorporation of dGMP, dCMP, and dAMP by the alpha subunit and the core of E. coli DNA polymerase III. When the polymerization reaction was performed with the alpha subunit, both dCMP and dGMP were misincorporated. The core, composed of alpha, epsilon, and theta subunits, misincorporated only dGMP. This would imply that the proofreading function of the epsilon subunit of DNA polymerase III may correct the dC.dA mispair but not the dG.dA mispair. Misincorporation of dAMP was not observed in reactions with the alpha subunit or core. The misincorporation of dGMP, but not dCMP, was almost completely suppressed by adding purified MutT protein to the reaction mixture. Under these conditions, only a portion of dGTP present in the reaction mixture was degraded. It is therefore likely that the MutT protein may prevent dGMP misincorporation by degrading a specific form of dGTP, probably the syn form, which can pair with deoxyadenosine.\r"

This is in contrast to the effects of Cox on P2, for which it is known from previous work that it acts as a repressor of the promoter Pc, which is responsible for expression of the immunity repressor C. The activator role of Cox was revealed by its effect on replication of P4 DNA and on the formation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase when a promoterless cat gene was inserted downstream of the P4 PII promoter. DNase I protection studies revealed that the Cox protein binds to the repressor promoter Pc of phage P2 and to the promoter PII of phage P4. In the latter case the Cox protein binds upstream of the -35 region, in analogy to several other activators of promoters. A weak binding was found in the promoters Pe of phage P2 and Ple of phage P4. The Cox protein is a case of viral transactivation of the replication genes of one phage by a control protein of the other. However, the effects of the Cox protein are totally different in the two phages, repressive in one case and activating in the other.\r"

  ".W": "4,5',8-Trimethylpsoralen (psoralen) plus near UV light produces interstrand crosslinks and monoadducts in DNA, both of which are mutagenic. In Escherichia coli, crosslinks are incised by UvrABC excinuclease, an event that can lead to homologous recombination and repair. To determine whether UvrABC incision of crosslinks is a step in the path to mutagenesis as well as repair, the effect of DNA homologous to a target gene on a plasmid was determined. pSV2-gpt DNA was treated with psoralen and transformed into a pair of hosts: one was gpt+, the other was delta (gpt-lac)5. The DNA was extracted and transformed into a tester strain [delta (gpt-lac)5] in which Gpt- mutations in the plasmid were scored. The results show that psoralen-induced mutations were reduced to background levels by the presence of the gpt+ homolog in the host chromosome. delta gpt hosts that were constitutively induced for the SOS response yielded point mutations, whereas noninduced hosts yielded almost exclusively large deletions. Since crosslinks were estimated to be responsible for most of the mutations observed, we conclude that the premutagenic lesion of psoralen crosslinks is recombinagenic and therefore very likely to be the product of UvrABC incision.\r"

  ".U": "89264549\r", 
  ".W": "The lac permease (lacY gene product) of Escherichia coli contains 417 amino acid residues and is predicted to have a short hydrophilic amino terminus on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, multiple transmembrane hydrophobic segments in alpha-helical conformation, and a 17-amino acid residue hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal tail on the inner surface of the membrane. To assess the importance of the carboxyl terminus, the properties of several truncation mutants were studied. The mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis such that stop codons were placed at specified positions, and the altered lacY genes were expressed at a relatively low rate from plasmid pACYC184. Permease truncated at position 407 or 401 retains full activity, and a normal complement of molecules is present in the membrane, as judged by immunoblot analyses. Thus, it is apparent that the carboxyl-terminal tail plays no direct role in membrane insertion of the permease, its stability, or in the mechanism of lactose/H+ symport. In marked contrast, when truncations are made at residues 396 (i.e., 4 amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus of putative helix XII), 389, 372, or 346, the permease is no longer found in the membrane. Remarkably, however, when each of the mutated lacY genes is expressed at a high rate by means of the T7 RNA polymerase system [Tabor, S. & Richardson, C. C. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 1074-1079], all of the truncated permeases are present in the membrane, as indicated by [35S]methionine incorporation studies; however, permease truncated at residue 396, 389, 372, or 346 is defective with respect to lactose/H+ symport. Finally, pulse-chase experiments indicate that wild-type permease or permease truncated at residue 401 is stable, whereas permease truncated at or prior to residue 396 is degraded at a significant rate. The results are consistent with the notion that residues 396-401 in putative helix XII are important for protection against proteolytic degradation and suggest that this region of the permease may be necessary for proper folding.\r"

To further define the central role of IIIGlc in these multiplex signaling mechanisms, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to construct three mutant IIIGlc proteins containing single amino acid changes; Phe-3 was replaced with tryptophan [( Trp3]IIIGlc), and His-75 and the active-site His-90 were replaced with glutamine [( Gln75]IIIGlc and [Gln90]IIIGlc, respectively). [Trp3]IIIGlc resembles the wild-type protein in most properties and should be valuable for spectrophotometric experiments. In contrast, clear differences between mutant and wild-type proteins were observed with both [Gln75]IIIGlc and [Gln90]IIIGlc in in vitro sugar phosphorylation assays. As predicted, [Gln90]IIIGlc with a modified active site cannot be phosphorylated. Unexpectedly, [Gln75]IIIGlc accepts but cannot transfer phosphoryl groups, suggesting His-75 may also be a critical amino acid for IIIGlc-mediated signaling mechanisms. The physiological effects of these mutations are briefly described.\r"

Included in this set are 8 precursors that have leader peptides that are cleaved in two places by mitochondrial matrix proteases. When these eight leader peptides are aligned and compared, a highly conserved three-amino acid motif is identified as being common to this class of leader peptides. This motif includes an arginine at position -10, a hydrophobic residue at position -8, and serine, threonine, or glycine at position -5 relative to the mature amino terminus. The initial cleavage of these peptides by matrix processing protease occurs within the motif, between residues at -9 and -8, such that arginine at position -10 is at position -2 relative to the cleaved bond. The rest of the motif is within the octapeptide removed by subsequent cleavage catalyzed by intermediate-specific protease. An additional 14 leader peptides in this collection (all of those that contain an arginine at -10) conform to this motif. Assuming that these 14 precursors are matured in two steps, we compared the internal cleavage sites at position -8 with the ends of the other 30 leader peptides in the collection. We find that 74% of matrix processing protease cleavage sites follow an arginine at position -2 relative to cleavage.\r"

The tsr gene was placed on the chromosome in single copy or on a low-copy-number plasmid. It was found that the Tsr protein appeared at the same point in the cell cycle as an endogenous C. crescentus methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein. Nuclease S1 mapping experiments showed that the tsr transcript was also controlled by the cell cycle, suggesting that the E. coli tsr gene is regulated by C. crescentus factors that mediate the timing of transcription initiation. The apparent transcription start site of the E. coli tsr gene was determined in both E. coli and C. crescentus, and we found that in both backgrounds the promoter used conforms to the consensus sequence for the promoters of the flagellar and chemosensory genes of Bacillus subtilis and E. coli. The use of this promoter suggests that C. crescentus has a cognate sigma factor and predicts that other C. crescentus genes are expressed from this consensus promoter.\r"

With T7 DNA polymerase and Mn2+, dideoxynucleotides and deoxynucleotides are incorporated at virtually the same rate. Mn2+ also reduces the discrimination against other analogs with modifications in the furanose moiety, the base, and the phosphate linkage. A metal buffer, isocitrate, expands the MnCl2 concentration range effective in catalyzing DNA synthesis. The lack of discrimination against dideoxynucleoside triphosphates using T7 DNA polymerase and Mn2+ results in uniform terminations of DNA sequencing reactions, with the intensity of adjacent bands on polyacrylamide gels varying in most instances by less than 10%.\r"

The poly(A) sites in the mRNAs formed by the fragment are the same whether the fragment resides at the native location or at a heterologous location. No single linker substitution abolishes the fragment's activity, whereas certain large, nonoverlapping deletions have strong, deleterious effects.

Cells expressing the mutant gene showed increased secretion of proinsulin relative to insulin and rapid release of newly synthesized proinsulin. Moreover, the mutant cell lines did not store the prohormone nor did they release it upon stimulation with secretagogues.

To determine which portions of these transmembrane proteins contain information necessary for their sorting, the behavior of two different G-hemagglutinin chimeric polypeptides, consisting of all or nearly all the luminal portion of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein linked to C-terminal segments of influenza hemagglutinin that included its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, was studied in MDCK cells transformed with the corresponding cDNAs. Both chimeras were transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and from there to the cell surface with the same rapid kinetics as the intact G protein. By using a cell surface immunoprecipitation assay with monolayers cultured on permeable filters that allows the recovery of labeled protein molecules present in each cell surface domain, it was found that both chimeric proteins as well as the intact G protein were delivered almost exclusively to the basolateral surface. This polarized distribution of the polypeptides did not change during a subsequent 90-min chase period, although during this time a large fraction of the glycoprotein molecules underwent degradation. In addition, a small fraction of the cell surface-associated glycoprotein molecules shed their ectoplasmic segments into the basolateral compartment, apparently as a result of a proteolytic cleavage. Immunofluorescence on transverse frozen sections and immunoelectron microscopy revealed a prominent accumulation of the chimeric polypeptides in the lateral cell membranes, with lesser amounts on the basal and apical surfaces. These results indicate that information specifying the basolateral transport of the G glycoprotein is located within the first 426 N-terminal amino acids of its ectoplasmic portion.\r"

MAP2 molecules microinjected into the nerve cell body were distributed not only throughout the cytoplasm of the cell body and dendrites, but also in the axon as far as a few millimeters from the cell body within 24 hr after injection. However, when injected cells were incubated for more than 3 days, the amount of biotin-labeled MAP2 in the axon decreased remarkably compared with that in the dendrites. This indicates that there is no sorting mechanism in the cell body for the transport of MAP2 selectively into the dendrites but that the turnover rate of MAP2 in the axons differs from that in the dendrites. To further characterize the mechanism of MAP2 compartmentation, we performed immunoelectron microscopy of injected cells and detergent extraction of microinjected cells prior to immunocytochemistry with anti-biotin. The results strongly suggest that a large part of axonal MAP2 is not associated with cytoskeleton and that this weak association of MAP2 favors selective loss of MAP2 from the axon.\r"

Surprisingly, many changes in this region can be tolerated under normal growth conditions. An exception is the lethality of several mutations at positions 159 and 160, 2 nucleotides previously shown to be protected from RNase digestion by the 19-kDa canine SRP protein. Nucleotide 160 is, in addition, the most highly conserved base in a consensus sequence for the most common tetranucleotide loop in ribosomal RNAs. Mutations that are likely to affect the stability and/or conformation of the RNA give rise to a conditional phenotype: when osmolarity of the medium is raised, the RNAs become partially or completely defective in function at high temperature.\r"

  ".W": "Ornithine transcarbamylase (ornithine carbamoyltransferase; carbamoyl-phosphate:L-ornithine carbamoyltransferase, EC 2.1.3.3) is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme of the mammalian urea cycle. The X chromosome-linked spfash mutation in the mouse causes partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and has served as a model for the human disease. We show here that the spfash mutation is a guanine to adenine transition of the last nucleotide of the fourth exon of the ornithine transcarbamylase gene. This nucleotide change produces two remarkably different effects. First, this transition causes ornithine transcarbamylase mRNA deficiency because the involved exon nucleotide plays a part in the recognition of the adjacent splice donor site. As a result of the mutation, ornithine transcarbamylase pre-mRNA is spliced inefficiently both at this site and at a cryptic splice donor site 48 bases into the adjacent intron. Second, two mutant proteins are translated from these mRNAs. From the correctly spliced mRNA, the transition results in a change of amino acid 129 from arginine to histidine. This missense substitution has no discernable effect on mitochondrial import, subunit assembly, or enzyme activity. On the other hand, the elongated mRNA resulting from mis-splicing is translated into a dysfunctional ornithine transcarbamylase subunit elongated by the insertion of 16 amino acid residues.\r"

  ".W": "2-Acetylaminofluorene (AAF), a potent rat liver carcinogen that binds covalently to the C-8 position of guanine residues in DNA, is an effective frameshift mutagen. The mutations are distributed nonrandomly, in that most are located at a few specific DNA sequences (i.e., mutation hot spots). Among these hot spots, the Nar I sequence (GGCGCC) is especially susceptible to the induction of -2 frameshift mutations (GGCGCC----GGCC). Due to the nature of the Nar I sequence, G1G2CG3CC, three different molecular events, each involving the deletion of two contiguous base pairs (i.e., G2C, CG3, G3C), can give rise to the observed end point (GGCC). To compare the potential role of each of the three possible guanine-AAF adducts in the Nar I site to induce the -2 frameshift mutation, we constructed double-stranded plasmid molecules containing a single-AAF adduct bound to one of the three guanine positions. Using these plasmids, we found that only the adduct in the G3 position induces the -2 frameshift mutation. This strong effect of the position of the -AAF adduct within the Nar I site is discussed in relation to the possible involvement of an unusual DNA conformation in the mutagenic processing.\r"

The PR-like duplicated gene segment was at some point translocated to a new site within the pol gene of a lentivirus (subsequent to the divergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1), where it has been maintained. We have identified in the vaccinia virus genome a sequence that is homologous to the PR-like duplicated gene segment of both types of retrovirus in an open reading frame whose product is predicted to be a 16.2-kDa protein. The vaccinia PR-like gene is located in the HindIII F fragment, and its product displays 31-34% amino acid identity to the two types of retroviral duplicated protease sequences over a region encompassing 125 amino acid residues. Sequences flanking the vaccinia gene showed no significant homology at either the DNA or amino acid level to the retroviruses. Nuclease S1 and primer extension analyses determined that the vaccinia gene is transcribed early in infection.\r"

  ".U": "89264583\r", 
  ".W": "Coculture of a series of anti-DR1Dw1 alloreactive human T-cell clones with autologous (DR4Dw4/DRw13Dw19) antigen-presenting cells and a series of recall antigens revealed that two of four clones tested proliferated in response to Candida albicans. One was restricted by DR4Dw4 and the other was restricted by DRw13Dw19. These results provide further evidence that many alloreactive T cells have a primary self-restricted specificity and cross-react on allogeneic major histocompatibility complex products. Structural comparison of the responder and stimulator DR molecules for these clones revealed that the regions predicted to contact the T cells' receptor, and thereby to determine self-restriction, are identical in sequence for DR4Dw4 and DR1Dw1 and differ by one residue between DRw13Dw19 and DR1Dw1. The DR beta residues that differ between responder, DR4Dw4 and DR13Dw19, and stimulator, DR1Dw1, are predicted to contribute to antigen binding. This implies that these anti-DR1 T cells may be specific for endogenous peptides that are bound by DR1 and not by the responder DR products, seen in a self-restricted manner. These T-cell clones also cross-reacted on DR4Dw13 and DRw14Dw16 molecules and on a human/murine hybrid class II dimer DR1 beta/I-E alpha. These reactions are discussed in terms of self-restricted peptide recognition. Thus these data suggest that in certain responder/stimulator combinations allorecognition may resemble self-restricted recognition of fragments of endogenous antigens that are bound by stimulator but not by responder major histocompatibility complex products.\r"

This chimeric protein, IL-4-PE40, was cytotoxic to murine IL-4 receptor-bearing cell lines but had little effect on human cell lines lacking receptors capable of binding murine IL-4. A mutant form of IL-4-PE40 (termed IL-4-PE40 asp553) with very low ADP-ribosylating activity displayed mitogenic activity similar to that of IL-4 rather than cytotoxic activity. Because the cytotoxic effects of IL-4-PE40 were blocked by excess IL-4 or by neutralizing antibody to IL-4 (11B11), we conclude that the cytotoxic effect of IL-4-PE40 is specifically mediated through IL-4 receptors. IL-4-PE40 could be a useful reagent for specific elimination of cells bearing IL-4 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, we demonstrate the sequence-specific suppression of viral expression in T cells chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), using antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. As a target for antisense intervention, we used the HIV-1 gene rev, which is essential for viral replication and regulates the expression of virion proteins, in part, by affecting the splicing of the viral mRNA. A phosphorothioate oligomer complementary to the initiation sequence of HIV-1 rev had a significant and selective inhibitory effect on the production of several viral proteins in chronically HIV-1-infected T cells and drastically reduced the unspliced (genomic) viral mRNA transcripts, with relative sparing of smaller (spliced) transcripts. By contrast, the antisense sequence with unmodified normal phosphodiester linkages as well as phosphorothioate oligomers containing sense, random, homopolymeric sequences, or antisense sequence with N3-methylthymidine residues did not have an inhibitory effect on viral expression. Thus, sequence specificity and nuclease resistance were critical for the anti-viral-gene regulatory effect of the antisense molecules. The altered HIV-1 mRNA profile induced by the antisense phosphorothioate oligomer suggests that the mechanism for the inhibition of viral expression is due to an interference with the regulatory gene, rev, by translation arrest.\r"

  ".W": "Human colorectal carcinomas frequently express elevated levels of c-myc mRNA in the absence of a gross genetic change at the c-myc locus. To test the hypothesis that these tumors are defective in a gene function necessary for the regulation of c-myc expression, we fused an osteosarcoma cell line that exhibits normal c-myc regulation with two colon carcinoma cell lines that express deregulated levels of c-myc mRNA. The levels of c-myc transcripts in all of the hybrid clones examined were normal and were induced normally by a mitogenic stimulus. Since rates of c-myc mRNA turnover in the colon carcinoma cells were found to be comparable to those in normal cells, increased message stability cannot account for the increased steady-state levels of transcripts. Our findings suggest that loss of function of a trans-acting regulator is responsible for the deregulation of c-myc expression in a major fraction of colorectal carcinomas. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms in tumor/normal tissue pairs from patients with primary colorectal lesions indicated that deregulation of c-myc expression in the tumors is correlated with frequent loss of alleles of syntenic markers on chromosome 5q; allele loss on 5q could be detected in 9 of 19 tumors expressing deregulated levels of c-myc mRNA, but not in any of 8 tumors expressing normal levels of c-myc RNA. Chromosome 5q is the region known to contain the gene for familial adenomatous polyposis, an inherited predisposition to colon cancer. These findings, together with the earlier finding that the colonic distribution of tumors exhibiting deregulated c-myc expression is similar to that reported for familial polyposis, provide evidence that loss of function of the familial adenomatous polyposis gene is involved in a subset of colorectal cancers in which c-myc expression is deregulated.\r"

Immunohistochemical analysis was also performed.

By depicting the bowel lumen, wall, and extramural structures, CT can provide unique information that complements standard air contrast radiography and endoscopy. Proper scanning methods and knowledge of normal anatomy are necessary for optimal results. We utilize the gas contrast technique for organ-specific examination in patients with known or suspected gastroduodenal disease. Gastric adenocarcinoma is an important indication for CT evaluation. Unfortunately, early hopes that CT could accurately stage gastric cancer have not been realized. CT is not as accurate as laparotomy in staging early gastric cancer, primarily owing to its inability to detect small peritoneal implants, diagnose metastases in normal-sized lymph perigastric nodes, and predict pancreatic invasion. Nevertheless, CT retains an important role in depicting gross metastatic disease and guiding percutaneous biopsy, particularly in patients who are deemed poor surgical candidates or have undergone prior gastric resection. A variety of conditions other than primary gastric adenocarcinoma produce recognizable abnormalities on CT. Gastric lipoma, leiomyosarcoma, and varices have a distinctive appearance. Others, including gastritis and uncomplicated peptic ulcer, produce nonspecific gastric wall thickening. Endoscopic correlation and biopsy are required for specific diagnosis in these cases. The duodenum, by virtue of its location in the anterior pararenal compartment of the retroperitoneum, may be involved by numerous benign and malignant conditions. In blunt trauma, complicated pancreatitis, and peptic ulcer disease, as well as primary and metastatic malignancy, CT can provide data that may alter patient management.\r"

Such disorders frequently are nonspecific in their presentation, often mimicking a variety of other acute abdominal disorders. No imaging test can provide a specific diagnosis in all circumstances. The choice of the initial imaging study for a particular presentation involves a compromise between various factors, including availability, safety, cost, clinical stability of the patient, the effect on other diagnostic tests and therapeutic maneuvers that may need to be performed, and the likelihood that the imaging method will provide at least some information localizing and characterizing the disorder. CT is not inexpensive, nor is it as rapidly performed as plain film radiography. Its spatial resolution limits its applicability in detection of gastrointestinal mucosal disease, fistulous tracts, and small vessel abnormalities. On the other hand, it is a powerful method to evaluate the full extraluminal extent of gastrointestinal abnormalities and to detect abnormalities of extraenteric organs and tissues. In some circumstances, such as trauma and suspected abdominal abscess, CT should probably be the initial imaging test. Also, when other imaging tests are nonrevealing, CT can provide valuable information and often suggest a clinically unsuspected gastrointestinal abnormality.\r"

These findings are associated in various combinations and occur with differing frequencies. Changes in pancreatic size may be found in many physiologic and pathologic conditions other than CP. The pancreas is usually larger during and shortly after acute relapses, whereas gland atrophy occurs in more advanced cases. A diagnosis of CP cannot generally be made only on the basis of a diffuse enlargement of the gland without changes in the echo-texture or in the MPD. Abnormalities of the parenchymal echo-texture are relatively sensitive but nonspecific for the diagnosis of CP. Calcifications can often be missed by US, and CT is clearly superior. Dilatation of the MPD is the most reliable sign of pancreatic disease. In CP, it generally has irregular walls, which is a distinctive finding that aids in differentiation of MPD dilatation occurring in pancreatic cancer. Changes in the MPD that are not visible under basal conditions may become evident under maximal hormonal (secretin) stimulation. Cysts and pseudocysts complicating the course of CP may present various shapes, contain necrotic debris, and even show a completely solid pattern. Dilatation of the CBD may also be seen as a consequence of a stricture of the intrapancreatic portion of the duct. Other complications, such as obstruction of the portal venous system, ascites, and pleural effusion, occur more rarely and are easily visualized by US. Despite the great technologic improvement of US in recent years, there is still general agreement that the US diagnosis of CP remains difficult owing to the polymorphism of anatomic changes and the relatively high incidence of false-negative results in early stages of the disease. It is, however, accepted that in clinical practice US currently is the first diagnostic step when CP is suspected.\r"

To investigate possible haematologic side effects of ATF, measurements of haemoglobin, haematocrit, fibrinogen concentration, thrombin, prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time, antithrombin-III and fibrinolytic activity were made in all patients preoperatively and on postoperative days 1 and 2. No statistical differences were then found between the controls and the ATF group. Microbiologic tests of blood sampled from the cardiotomy reservoir gave satisfactory results.\r"

Treatment with the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist dextrophan or the competitive antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid limited the resultant neurological dysfunction; dextrorphan treatment also improved the bioenergetic state after trauma and increased the intracellular free magnesium.

Prospective ectodermal cells dissected from the animal hemisphere can be respecified to form mesodermal tissues by recombination with vegetal tissue or by treatment with any of several polypeptide growth factors or growth factor-like molecules. Together with the discovery that several developmental mutations in Drosophila are in genes with significant homology to mammalian mitogens and oncogenes, these observations suggest that early developmental signals may use similar transduction pathways to mitogenic signals characterized in cultured mammalian cells. Whether mesoderm can be induced by activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways implicated in mitogenesis and oncogenesis has been investigated with the viral oncogene polyoma middle T. Microinjection of middle T messenger RNA into early embryos results in the respecification of isolated prospective ectodermal tissue to form characteristic mesodermal structures. Middle T in frog blastomeres appears to associate with cellular activities similar to those observed in polyoma-transformed mouse cells, and transformation-defective middle T mutants fail to induce mesoderm. These results suggest that early inductive signals and mitogenic and oncogenic stimuli may share common signal transduction pathways.\r"

The synthesis of macrobicyclic ligands for ferric ion has been accomplished by using active esters of catechol ligands in which catecholate coordination to iron is a prelude to the organic chemical reactions that link the coordination subunits together into one ligand system surrounding a central metal ion coordination site. The lanthanide(III) ions, which are among the most labile metal ions known, have coordination numbers of 8 or higher, and thus their encapsulation into a macrobicyclic structure is a challenging problem. Lanthanide amine complexes have been used as metal templates in the synthesis of such macrobicyclic lanthanide complexes. There is evidence that such a complex is inert to exchange in aqueous solution.\r"

All of the three proline tRNA species, which read CCN codons in Salmonella typhimurium, have been sequenced and shown to contain m1G in position 37. A mutant of S. typhimurium that lacks m1G in its tRNA when grown at temperatures above 37 degrees C, has now been isolated. The mutation (trmD3) responsible for this methylation deficiency is in the structural gene (trmD) for the tRNA(m1G37)methyltransferase. Therefore, the three proline tRNAs in the trmD3 mutant have an unmodified guanosine at position 37. Furthermore, the trmD3 mutation also causes at least one of the tRNAPro species to frequently shift frame when C's are present successively in the message. Thus, m1G appears to prevent frameshifting.

  ".W": "Cell fusion (syncytium formation) is a major cytopathic effect of infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and may also represent an important mechanism of CD4+ T-cell depletion in individuals infected with HIV. Syncytium formation requires the interaction of CD4 on the surface of uninfected cells with HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 expressed on HIV-infected cells. However, several observations suggest that molecules other than CD4 play a role in HIV-induced cell fusion. The leukocyte adhesion receptor LFA-1 is involved in a broad range of leukocyte interactions mediated by diverse receptor-ligand systems including CD4-class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Possible mimicry of class II MHC molecules by gp120 in its interaction with CD4 prompted an examination of the role of LFA-1 in HIV-induced cell fusion. A monoclonal antibody against LFA-1 completely inhibited HIV-induced syncytium formation. The antibody did not block binding of gp120 to CD4. This demonstrates that a molecule other than CD4 is also involved in cell fusion mediated by HIV.\r"

In addition, many long fine filopodial processes extended from the periphery of such transfected cells. Stable CHO cell lines expressing GAP-43 also exhibited processes that were more numerous, far longer, and more complex than those of CHO cell lines not transfected or transfected with control plasmids. Thus GAP-43 may directly contribute to growth cone activity by regulating cell membrane structure and enhancing extension of filopodial processes.\r"

It was found that mothers' attitudes toward their children's illnesses were strongly and positively related to their children's attitudes toward their illnesses, and that these attitudes were strongly correlated with psychological distress. These findings underscore the need to consider the parent-child relationship when treating the adolescent patient.\r"

Adhesions between the ventral wall of the dura and posterior longitudinal ligament could act as a preconditioning factor.

Pancreatic enzyme output must be reduced to less than 10 per cent of normal before fat absorption is appreciably impaired, proving that the pancreas secretes a large surplus of enzymes. Surgical therapy does not improve pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and partial pancreatic resection frequently precipitates steatorrhea in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Therefore, pancreatic resection should be undertaken cautiously in patients who do not yet have clinically evident exocrine insufficiency. In most patients, oral pancreatic enzymes will control diarrhea secondary to steatorrhea. In others, concurrent administration of an H2 blocker is required to reduce gastric acidity and prevent enzyme inactivation in the stomach. Formulations with an acid-resistant coating are also effective in some patients. However, complete normalization of fat absorption with restoration of body weight and nutritional well-being requires careful management of multiple dietary and behavioral factors, as well as long-term follow-up. Unfortunately, this appears to be an elusive goal, as many patients with chronic pancreatitis continue to die of malnutrition.\r"

Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy is indicated in patients with a dilated (larger than 7 mm) duct and pain that requires narcotic analgesics for relief. Chronic pseudocysts may be corrected surgically without the usual 6-week wait, and asymptomatic pseudocysts less than 4 cm in diameter may not require surgery at all. The relative efficacy and risks of percutaneous drainage of pseudocysts versus the standard surgical approaches need to be studied. Pancreatic fistulas may be external or internal, where pancreatic ascites or hydrothorax can be the clinical manifestation. The pharmacologic suppression of pancreatic secretion (e.g., with somatostatin) may be useful in their management, but surgery may be required. Pancreatic resection or internal drainage is usually effective. Persistent jaundice should be relieved surgically by choledochoduodenostomy to avoid the development of secondary biliary cirrhosis. Obstruction at various levels of the gastrointestinal tract (duodenum, small bowel, colon) may require bypass (gastrojejunostomy) or resection. Hemorrhage from major arteries is an infrequent but often lethal complication of chronic pancreatitis, especially associated with pseudocysts. Angiography is invaluable for diagnosis and occasionally for treatment (embolization). Surgery is preferred in good-risk patients, with suture ligation (resection) of the bleeding source. Chronic pancreatitis is the most common cause of splenic vein thrombosis. The resultant hemorrhage from gastric varices is managed effectively by splenectomy.\r"

The use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, CT, and angiography to define the structural abnormalities has increased the surgeon's ability to select an operation matched to the patient's needs. A longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy should be performed in patients whose ducts are dilated. When the head of the pancreas is enlarged and thickened, pancreaticoduodenectomy has been the traditional operation of choice. However, local resection with pyloric and duodenal preservation should now be considered an alternative that has a lower mortality rate and less likelihood of creating diabetes or exocrine insufficiency. Patients whose ducts are of insufficient caliber to permit longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy are candidates for resection of the proximal or distal pancreas, depending on the site of disease or, alternatively, for the Beger or Warren procedure. Pain relief is achieved with surgery in about 80 per cent of patients with chronic pancreatitis. Many of the late deaths following operation for chronic pancreatitis are attributable, not to the operation, but to the effects of alcoholism. There is a need for surgeons to improve their observations and assessment of operative results.\r"

  ".W": "The most important diagnostic step in the management of patients with severe acute pancreatitis is the discrimination between acute interstitial and necrotizing pancreatitis. Measurement of C-reactive protein, lactic acid dehydrogenase, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and alpha-2-macroglobulin and contrast-enhanced CT are useful in detecting the necrotizing course of acute pancreatitis. C-reactive protein, lactic acid dehydrogenase, and contrast-enhanced CT offer detection rates of 85 per cent to more than 90 per cent for pancreatic necrosis. Surgical decision-making in necrotizing pancreatitis should be based on clinical, morphologic, and bacteriologic data. Patients with focal pancreatic necrosis, in general, respond well to medical treatment and do not need surgery. Extended (50 per cent or more) pancreatic necroses, infected necroses, and intrapancreatic parenchymal necroses plus extrapancreatic fatty tissue necroses are indicators for surgical management. The decision for the timing of operation in patients with proved necrotizing pancreatitis should be based on clinical criteria: the development of an acute surgical abdomen, generalized sepsis, shock, persisting or increasing organ dysfunction, or some combination thereof despite maximum intensive care treatment for at least 3 days. Major pancreatic resection for the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis appears disadvantageous. Necrosectomy and continuous local lavage allow debridement of devitalized tissue and preservation of vital pancreatic tissue. Postoperative local lavage thus results in an atraumatic evacuation of necrotic tissue, the bacterial material, and biologically active substances. The hospital mortality rate of patients treated with necrosectomy and continuous local lavage (the Ulm protocol) is below 10 per cent. Nevertheless, controlled prospective clinical trials should be performed in order to bring more precision to our clinical decisions in respect to the role of surgery for this disease.\r"

Jaundice should be relieved early as this eliminates distressing pruritus, improves the quality of life, and avoids the sequelae of prolonged extrahepatic obstruction. The procedure may prolong survival, but this has not been proved. Biliary obstruction is managed best by a simple loop cholecystojejunostomy. If the gallbladder is unavailable, a choledochojejunostomy is equally effective. Nonsurgical techniques such as percutaneous or endoscopically placed biliary stents may be appropriate in patients who are not candidates for surgery. A gastrojejunostomy should be done in all patients who have gastroduodenal obstruction by tumor. Most patients who undergo surgical biliary bypass also should have a gastrojejunostomy, even if gastroduodenal obstruction has not yet developed. Otherwise, more than 20 per cent of patients may need a second operation if gastroduodenal obstruction develops later. Pain, a problem in more than half of patients, is best relieved by an intraoperative celiac ganglion block with 50 per cent ethanol. Laparotomy is desirable in most of these patients with pancreatic cancer, because it provides tissue for diagnosis, allows a definite assessment of resectability, and produces effective palliation.\r"

Now it is clear that the endoscopic approach is preferable to the percutaneous method. When palliation of jaundice is required (in a patient without impending duodenal obstruction), there is a simple choice between surgical bypass or endoscopic stenting. Stenting is substantially cheaper than surgery--at least for the initial admission. Recovery from stenting is almost immediate, which cannot be said for surgical intervention. Time will tell how far the need for readmission (stent blockage, duodenal obstruction) will erode these advantages. The main factor influencing our decision (stent or surgery), apart from the hope of resection, is the patient's general status, or \"operative risk.\" Unfortunately, there is no accepted risk factor scale or template against which our experiences can be compared. There are no absolutes, only a spectrum of patients who differ according to the tumor load and their general medical condition. A fit patient with a relatively small tumor is best served by surgical intervention. The diagnosis and its unresectable nature can be established beyond doubt, and anastomoses (biliary and gastroduodenal) can be established of such a size that subsequent obstruction is unlikely. The operative mortality rate will be low. Patients with a large tumor load and poor general condition are best served by an endoscopic stent. Between these positions lies a spectrum of patients and plenty of room for discussion and personal opinions. Drainage procedures are unwarranted in patients who are truly terminal. Specialist vested interests have seriously jaundiced the view of many people in this field--and obstructed attempts at consensus. As in the management of patients with gallstone disease, it is important that surgeons, endoscopists, and radiologists work together as teams in the best interests of our patients, present and future.\r"

The presence of cysts in the liver or kidney should be sought. The relation of the lesion to the duodenum and biliary tract needs to be defined. The possibility that the \"cyst\" represents necrosis of a primary adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic duct should be considered prior to laparotomy. At the time of operation, biopsy of the cyst wall and frozen-section study are fundamental to a decision whether resection or drainage is the treatment of choice. Resection is generally the treatment of the cystic neoplasms, drainage the treatment of pseudocysts. The failure of the surgeon to distinguish between the two groups may be catastrophic. The true cysts and cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are rare lesions. The clinical and radiologic characteristics, the pathologic features, and the natural history of these lesions are not fully documented. Therefore, when they are encountered, the clinician who will carefully document their characteristics can make a contribution to our knowledge.\r"

In addition, the clinical course of patients with tumor in lymph nodes is benign, suggesting that more patients than were previously thought are now candidates for cure. Improved knowledge of the anatomic location of gastrinomas has enhanced our ability to find and remove them at laparotomy. As a result of these factors, more patients are being cured than ever before, and in the future, cure rate may be even higher.

In the former experiments, the high sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria and fungi to Silastic (silicone rubber) catheters pretreated with silver nitrate solution was determined. The antimicrobrial activity remained unchanged after both sterilization and up to six weeks of storage. Furthermore, prolonged incubation of treated catheter segments in Escherichia coli inoculated plasma resulted in a significant reduction of organisms in the media and those adherent to the surface of the catheters. The in vivo experiments were performed upon two groups of rabbits. In the first group, catheters (one treated and one untreated) were implanted into contralateral jugular veins. In the second group, alternating treated and control catheter segments were threaded onto polyethylene core tubing; the resulting string of segments was positioned in the inferior vena cava. Five to 11 days after implantation of the catheter, all rabbits were intravenously injected with live E. coli (approximately 10(8) to 10(9) organisms per kilogram of weight); 18 to 24 hours later, the catheters and blood samples were removed for cultivation. Significant reductions in both incidence and magnitude of colonization in treated catheters by E. coli were observed in both rabbit groups. Additionally, histologic examination did not reveal any significant differences between contralateral jugular veins (previously in prolonged and intimate contact with the indwelling catheters), confirming the absence of any local adverse effects of silver nitrate.\r"

During the last four years 1H MRI characteristics, including spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) and spin-spin relaxation times (T2), have been established for several types of tumors. The introduction of surface coils to the imaging process has significantly improved the quality of intraocular MR images, leading some clinicians to suggest that 1H MR images are preferable to CT scans. Another MRI technique, in which sodium-23 (23Na) is imaged rather than protons, is now under development as tool for intraocular diagnosis. The potential of 23Na MRI depends upon the high concentration and \"visibility\" of sodium in the vitreous body, and upon the apparent differences in sodium behavior in normal cells vs. tumor cells. The metabolism of normal ocular tissues and intraocular tumors may be probed noninvasively with phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy (31P MRS). Much progress has been made during the last few years in understanding the appearance of 31P MR spectra of many types of healthy and diseased cells and tissues. Clinical application of this technique to the diagnosis and monitoring of intraocular tumors following conservative treatment will be dependent upon the development of spectroscopy techniques that collect information from the volume of interest (tumor) only.\r"

However, visual disturbance and eye discomfort affects many workers using VDUs, and these symptoms may be alleviated by a number of measures, including proper diagnosis of pre-existing ocular problems, use of special eyeglasses, and correct arrangement of lighting and furniture in the work area.\r"

The main clinical presentations were dyspnea and tachyarrhythmias seen in 11 patients. Nineteen patients had a correct preoperative diagnosis. Echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis in eight patients, angiocardiography in four, and both these techniques in seven. The diagnosis was established at the operative table in one case in which the preoperative diagnosis was mitral stenosis. All tumors were successfully removed with cardiopulmonary bypass. There were no operative deaths. Excision of the tumor resulted in marked symptomatic improvement. No recurrences have been observed. A differential approach to preoperative investigation, surgical treatment, and follow-up is suggested according to the clinical behavior of the tumor. Excision of the tumor appears to be curative, with no recurrences at long-term follow-up in cases of \"sporadic\" myxoma. The risk of recurrences is much higher when a \"complex\" or a \"familial\" myxoma is faced. For these types, our recommendations are presented.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of perioperative blood transfusion on postoperative depression of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and the effect of ranitidine on transfusion-induced changes in postoperative CMI were investigated. CMI was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively by skin testing with seven common delayed-type antigens in 83 consecutive patients undergoing major elective abdominal surgery. Sixty-six of these patients were randomly divided into ranitidine or no-ranitidine-treatment groups, and the remaining 17 patients were operated on without ranitidine. Thus, 50 patients were operated on without ranitidine therapy, and whole blood transfusion was given to 24 of these patients. Postoperative skin test response was more reduced in transfused vs nontransfused patients (-57% vs -38%, p less than 0.0001). Fourteen of the 24 patients receiving blood transfusion could be exactly matched to 14 patients not receiving transfusion (age, sex, B-hemoglobin, S-albumin, type and duration of surgery, etc.), which confirmed that a more pronounced reduction in postoperative skin test response was found in transfused patients (-55% vs -31%, p less than 0.0001). Seventeen of the 33 patients treated with perioperative ranitidine, 50 mg intravenously every 6 hours for 72 hours, received perioperative blood transfusion. Eleven of these patients could be matched to 11 transfused patients not receiving perioperative ranitidine. Ranitidine prevented postoperative reduction in skin test response (+6% vs -55%, p less than 0.0001). It is concluded that perioperative transfusion with whole blood amplifies the postoperative impairment in delayed hypersensitivity and that transfusion-induced postoperative impairment in delayed hypersensitivity may be prevented by perioperative ranitidine treatment.\r"

The effects of hypothermia, ventilation without perfusion, and various reperfusion solutions (PSS/Ficoll or whole blood) on the development of ischemia-reperfusion lung injury were investigated. Use of an ex vivo rat lung model in which the above variables were individually varied permitted a direct approach for these studies. Normothermic ischemia for 1 hour caused significant damage, documented by increased iodine 125 bovine serum albumin (125I-BSA) in alveolar lavage fluid and lung parenchyma compared with nonischemic controls. Hypothermic (4 degrees C) ischemia for 4 hours in lungs reperfused with salt solution and for as many as 12 hours in lungs reperfused with whole blood caused no significant increase in 125I-BSA in alveolar lavage fluid and lung parenchyma compared with nonischemic controls. Lungs ventilated without perfusion showed no increase in 125I-BSA leakage compared with controls. The ex vivo rat lung model is excellent for studying ischemia-reperfusion injury. It is reproducible, allows for variance of reperfusion solutions, and permits change in temperature and ventilation easily.\r"

Most of the 38 previously reported cases have occurred in patients who have undergone radiation therapy, although several patients have had TEF as an initial manifestation of lymphoma. TEF is usually, but not universally, associated with the presence of active lymphoma. The surgical approach should be individualized, based on the patient's overall condition, the site and size of the fistula, and sites of disease. Often a conservative surgical approach is warranted with the expectation that many of these fistulas will close after radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Patients with lymphoma-related TEF have a better prognosis than do those with TEF caused by carcinoma of the lung or esophagus.\r"

Transfusion of normal AT-III concentrate led to a striking clinical recovery. Blood coagulation studies revealed that nine of 13 family members had decreased biologic AT-III activity and that the patient herself was the only homozygote with variant AT-III.

Initial diagnostic evaluation revealed high-grade ureteropelvic junction obstruction in a solitary functioning kidney with a nonobstructive megaureter. After pyeloplasty and with changing transitional nephrology, the megaureter became obstructive requiring tailoring and reimplantation. The unifying concept of ureteral valves explaining this case is presented.\r"

TRUS can detect nonpalpable tumors with average dimensions as small as 1.0 cm. This size is considered to be clinically significant.\r"

No pneumothoraces occurred in any patient. Compliance rates were between 65% (90/139) and 83% (90/108), depending on the patient population considered. Demographic factors unrelated to discontinuing using CPAP included age, sex, and the presence of a housemate. Better-educated patients were less able to tolerate the equipment. Dry throat and nose and sore eyes were the most common side effects, but only sore eyes related to the amount of pressure. Side effects were unrelated to the number of months on the treatment, and obesity was related to higher pressures. Our study provides optimistic intermediate-term follow-up observations of patients on nasal CPAP therapy for sleep apnea. Whether adverse consequences occur over longer periods of time remains to be seen.\r"

There are five therapeutic modalities for the treatment of malignant pericardial effusion, including pericardiocentesis, pericardial sclerosis, systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical treatment. The optimal treatment selection is dependent principally on a patient's life expectancy; responsiveness of the tumor to chemotherapy, irradiation, or both; and whether or not cardiac tamponade is present at diagnosis. The overall prognosis of patients with malignant pericardial effusion is primarily influenced by the extent and histologic features of the underlying cancer. Although this condition is usually incurable, a reasonable period of useful palliation can be obtained in most patients.\r"

In animals, this drug has not been shown to induce catalepsy and only weakly antagonizes the stereotypic movements induced by apomorphine and the amphetamines. Clozapine is rapidly absorbed after both single and repeated oral doses, with steady-state concentrations attained within eight to ten days after beginning therapy. It is metabolized to N-oxideclozapine and N-desmethylclozapine, which have less pharmacological activity than the parent compound and are excreted in the urine and, to a lesser extent, in the feces. Clozapine has overall therapeutic efficacy and/or superiority to currently marketed antipsychotics in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. Usual doses (25-900 mg/d) of clozapine cause fewer extrapyramidal adverse reactions than available antipsychotics. Hypotension, dizziness, salivation, and sedation are the most frequently reported adverse effects and tend to subside over time. Agranulocytosis is the most serious adverse reaction, and those receiving clozapine should undergo weekly white blood cell count determinations. Clozapine is useful for those treatment-resistant patients who have not responded to adequate trials of other antipsychotics.\r"

A study of homosexual patients with thrombocytopenia indicates 93 percent had serological evidence of HIV exposure whereas only 33 percent of homosexuals without thrombocytopenia exhibited this finding. Thrombocytopenia in patients with hemophilia has been identified as an increased risk factor for AIDS development and has been observed in about one-third of children with AIDS. The management of thrombocytopenia in HIV-infected patients poses a therapeutic dilemma for clinicians since many of the traditional modalities for treating immune thrombocytopenia may adversely affect the underlying disease process or further compromise the immune system. Splenectomy, corticosteroids, danazol, intravenous immune globulin, vincristine, and RHo(D) immune globulin have all been used with variable results. A new technique that physically removes antibodies and immune complexes associated with thrombocytopenia is under investigation. Due to either toxicity or the high incidence of transient response, asymptomatic patients may not be candidates for treatment.\r"
