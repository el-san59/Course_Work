  ".W": "PVNS is a proliferative disorder that can affect joints, tendons and bursae. Its etiology is unknown. The most widely accepted theories attribute this disorder to a chronic inflammatory response or a benign neoplasm of fibrohistiocytic origin. On gross specimens, the synovial changes are characterized by villous and/or nodular hyperplasia. This disorder occurs most frequently in the third or fourth decades of life and has no sex predilection. As a joint problem, it favors the knee and hip. As a tendon abnormality, it favors the digits. Plain film findings include 1) soft tissue swelling, 2) increased density of the synovium secondary to hemosiderin deposition, 3) multiple subchondral cysts, and 4) extrinsic cortical pressure erosions. Cartilage space narrowing, if present, is gradual and occurs later than the other plain film findings. Arthrography can demonstrate the nodular synovial changes and determine if the process is diffuse or focal. MRI can, in some cases, reveal areas of decreased signal within the hyperplastic synovium reflecting the deposition of hemosiderin. The major roentgen differential diagnoses of articular PVNS include uncalcified synovial chondromatosis, tuberculous arthritis, and hemophilic arthropathy.\r"

The most common cause of acute pain in the nontraumatized shoulder is calcific tendonitis or bursitis readily identified by plain film radiography. On the other hand, the evaluation of chronic pain usually requires some combination of arthrography, CT, ultrasonography, and MRI to identify the source of the patients' complaints with certainty. The shoulder is rarely the site of a monoarticular process and is infrequently the dominant site of abnormality in a generalized articular disease. Clues to generalized disease processes are sometimes evidenced by changes within the shoulder present on the chest film. The source of pain in the shoulder was often elusive and puzzling to both the clinician and radiologist prior to the development of techniques such as arthrography, CT, and MRI that allow the precise delineation of soft tissue abnormalities. The judicious use of these techniques has, in large measure, helped to solve the puzzle.\r"

Two main theories of pathophysiologic pathways have evolved: (1) the neurotraumatic, which states that the changes result from mechanical trauma and repetitive injuries to an insensitive extremity or joint and (2) the neurovascular, which states that the changes result from a neurally initiated vascular reflex that leads to hyperemia, angiogenesis, and very active bone resorption by osteoclasts. Through clinical, radiographic, and pathologic observation, it appears evident that both pathways contribute to neuropathic bone and joint disease. Initially, the alteration of sympathetic control triggers a persistent hyperemia, leading to active bone resorption. There may or may not be associated pathologic fractures and subsequent repair. This depends upon the degree of joint insensitivity and whether or not it is subjected to continued weightbearing. If so, the neurotraumatic mechanisms come into play, but only secondarily.\r"

The examinations were performed 3, 6, 9, and 15 months after surgery and radiation therapy. Eight patients underwent radiation therapy before surgery and ten after surgery; three underwent only surgery. Criteria for recurrence included increased anteroposterior diameter of the vaginal cuff (greater than 2.2 cm); structural alterations or presence of a mass in the vaginal cuff; and infiltration of the rectovaginal septum, bladder, and parametria. Transrectal US findings were true positive for recurrence in nine cases, true negative in ten, and false positive in two. US findings were true positive in three cases, true negative in seven, false positive in two, and false negative in three. In six cases results from US were technically poor, and no diagnosis could be made. Transrectal US was highly sensitive in detection of pelvic recurrent carcinomas, while US had little diagnostic value. The authors believe transrectal US can replace US in the evaluation of patients at risk for recurrent pelvic neoplasm.\r"

Computed tomography (CT) was used as a standard. EU/LT permitted detection of 10% of CT-confirmed masses (cystic or solid) less than 1 cm, 21% of lesions greater than or equal to 1 cm but less than 2 cm, 52% of lesions greater than or equal to 2 cm but less than 3 cm, and 85% of lesions 3 cm or more in diameter. US permitted detection of 26% of CT-confirmed lesions less than 1 cm, 60% of lesions greater than or equal to 1 cm but less than 2 cm, 82% of lesions greater than or equal to 2 cm but less than 3 cm, and 85% of lesions 3 cm or more in size. The results confirm the relative insensitivity of EU/LT for masses less than 3 cm in diameter and of US for masses less than 2 cm. Further, they suggest that CT may have a role not only in evaluation of cases in which the urographic or sonographic results are questionable or positive, but also in confirmation of apparently negative urographic findings when clinical suspicion of a lesion is high.\r"

The normal renal allograft exhibits low-impedance arterial inflow similar to that seen in the normotopic kidney. The authors and others previously reported that a high vascular impedance, defined as either a pulsatility index (PI) greater than 1.8 or a resistive index greater than 0.9, indicates acute vascular rejection (AVR). Although AVR remains the most common cause of increased PI, the authors noted ten episodes among 180 serially followed-up transplants in which abnormal waveforms were clearly not due to rejection. Four other causes of increased vascular impedance are reported, including renal vein obstruction, severe acute tubular necrosis, pyelonephritis, and extrarenal compression of the graft. These new causes only slightly decrease the specificity of high vascular impedance for rejection. Furthermore, the cause can usually be recognized from the clinical history or other US findings.\r"

Thirty-eight episodes of transplant rejection in 32 patients (63% proved pathologically) and 24 episodes of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in 24 patients were encountered. The Doppler spectral waveform was characterized by means of the pulsatility index (PI), systolic/diastolic ratio (SDR), diastolic/systolic ratio (SDR), diastolic/systolic ratio (DSR), and resistive index (RI). Accuracy was optimized with use of top normal values as follows: PI = 1.8, SDR = 4.0, DSR = 0.25, RI = 0.75. There were no significant differences in the indices for those patients undergoing rejection versus those with ATN. The sensitivity for predicting transplant rejection was adversely affected by the history of either ATN or a previous rejection episode in the same allograft. Comparison with concurrent radionuclide examinations revealed similar sensitivities for rejection with scintigraphy and sonography. Differentiation of ATN from rejection was more reliable with scintigraphy than with sonography.\r"

The common bile duct, main portal vein, and hepatic artery were cannulated and injected with air, dilute contrast medium, and mineral oil, respectively.

In the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe, the bile ducts were anterior to the portal vein in seven cases, posterior in seven, and tortuous (ie, both anterior and posterior) in three. In the medial segment of the left lobe, the bile ducts were anterior in four cases, posterior in four, tortuous in three, and not seen in six. In the right lobe, the bile ducts were anterior in nine cases, posterior in five, tortuous in one, and not seen in two. In the porta hepatis, the bile ducts were anterior in ten cases, posterior in one, tortuous in five, and not seen in one. Histologic findings confirmed the anterior and posterior location of the bile ducts relative to the portal veins. These findings contradict the commonly held view of intrahepatic bile ducts being anterior to the portal vein and are clinically significant for techniques such as bile duct drainage.\r"

Seventeen Doppler studies in 17 patients showed complete absence of diastolic flow. Review of biopsy results for each group showed no significant difference in the proportion of acute allograft rejection present (42% for the normal group and 46% for the group lacking diastolic flow). The data from 53 US and biopsy examinations performed 2 days apart in 37 patients confirmed the lack of correlation between absent hepatic artery diastolic blood flow and rejection. The authors conclude that the loss of hepatic artery diastolic flow has no apparent clinical application for the diagnosis of acute hepatic allograft rejection.\r"

The clinical diagnoses were cytomegalovirus infection (five patients), rubella (two patients), congenital syphilis (one patient), and trisomy 13 syndrome (three patients). No diagnosis was made in one infant. At neuropathologic examination, perforating medium-sized arteries to the basal ganglia and thalami had thickened hypercellular walls, with deposits of amorphous basophilic material in three infants. Results of computed tomography and radiography of brain sections were normal in these areas. Sonography is helpful in detecting early noncalcific inflammation and mineralization in vasculitis. Although nonspecific, these findings should alert the physician to the possibility of congenital infection or chromosomal abnormality.\r"

Conventional screen-film angiography was used as an adjunct to DSA when a larger field of view was needed (five patients) and when bowel motion prevented the acquisition of adequate image quality with DSA (two patients). Conventional angiography was also performed in all cases in which there were negative DSA examinations. DSA reduced the mean examination time considerably (20% reduction overall), especially for cases involving embolization therapy (35% reduction). DSA was especially valuable in the upper GI tract, where it was used to rapidly locate and/or assist in the embolization of bleeding sites in 19 of 20 patients with positive angiograms. There were 12 true-negative DSA examinations and one false-negative examination due to the limited field of view (9 inches [22.9 cm]). Bowel and respiratory motion were not important problems in the upper GI tract. In the lower GI tract, the usefulness of DSA was severely limited by the small field of view and the misregistration artifact caused by bowel motion. In an in vitro study, DSA and conventional angiography were compared as to their ability to depict several rates of extravasation of contrast material in a model of GI bleeding. DSA tended to be more sensitive for the detection of simulated extravasation (P less than .07).\r"

Advantages of ISIS include the ability to use proton images to define the volume of interest (VOI) and reduced dependence on exact positioning of the surface coil. However, rapid replication of the surface coil ISIS experiment can cause spectral contamination from signals originating outside the VOI. A modified version of the ISIS experiment was developed to alleviate contamination under conditions of rapid replication. Applications of localized P-31 MR spectroscopy for observation of high-energy phosphorus metabolites are presented in human liver, heart, and transplanted and normal kidney.\r"

Studies revealed a specific and marked (90 to 95 percent) deficit in [3H]strychnine binding sites in spinal cord membranes from myoclonic animals compared to controls, reflecting a loss of, or defect in, glycine/strychnine receptors. Spinal cord synaptosomes prepared from affected animals showed a significantly increased ability to accumulate [3H]glycine, indicating an increased capacity of the high-affinity neuronal uptake system for glycine. In contrast, stimulus-induced glycine release and spinal cord glycine concentrations were unaltered.\r"

Although the biologic effects of the different hematopoietic growth factors have been well documented in different culture systems, it has only recently become possible to study the activities of these molecules in vivo. In comparison with the later acting hematopoietic growth factors granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IL-3 elicited a delayed and relatively modest leukocytosis when continuously infused intravenously in primates. The IL-3 infusion, however, greatly potentiated the responsiveness of the animal to subsequent administration of a low dose of GM-CSF. These results suggest that IL-3 expands an early cell population in vivo that subsequently requires the action of a later acting factor such as GM-CSF to complete its development. Optimal stimulation of hematopoiesis may be achieved with combinations of hematopoietic growth factors.\r"

Na+ and Ca2+ channels consist of a principal transmembrane subunit, which forms the ion-conducting pore and is expressed with a variable number of associated subunits in different cell types. The principal subunits of voltage-sensitive Na+, Ca2+, and K+ channels are homologous members of a gene family. Models relating the primary structures of these principal subunits to their functional properties have been proposed, and experimental results have begun to define a functional map of these proteins. Coordinated application of biochemical, biophysical, and molecular genetic methods should lead to a clear understanding of the molecular basis of electrical excitability.\r"

The modifications are obtained in less than 1 hour and persist for more than 40 minutes. Thus, acetylcholine and norepinephrine have a permissive role in use-dependent neuronal plasticity.

To investigate this an anticodon change (3'-UCC-5') was introduced into one of the four methionine initiator (tRNAi(met) genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ability of the mutant transfer RNA to restore growth properties to his4 initiator codon mutant yeast strains in the absence of histidine was then assayed. Only the complementary codon, AGG, at the his4 initiator region supported His+ growth. The mutant transfer RNA also directed the ribosome to initiate at an AGG placed in the upstream region of the his4 message. Initiation at this upstream AGG precluded initiation at a downstream AGG in accordance with the \"scanning\" model. Therefore, an anticodon: codon interaction between tRNAi(met) as part of the scanning ribosome and the first AUG must function in directing the ribosome to the eukaryotic initiator region.\r"

The potential of these microscopes for revealing subtle details of structure is illustrated by atomic resolution images including graphite, an organic conductor, an insulating layered compound, and individual adsorbed oxygen atoms on a semiconductor. Application of the STM for imaging biological materials directly has been hampered by the poor electron conductivity of most biological samples. The use of thin conductive metal coatings and replicas has made it possible to image some biological samples, as indicated by recently obtained images of a recA-DNA complex, a phospholipid bilayer, and an enzyme crystal. The potential of the AFM, which does not require a conductive sample, is shown with molecular resolution images of a nonconducting organic monolayer and an amino acid crystal that reveals individual methyl groups on the ends of the amino acids. Applications of these new microscopes to technology are demonstrated with images of an optical disk stamper, a diffraction grating, a thin-film magnetic recording head, and a diamond cutting tool. The STM has even been used to improve the quality of diffraction gratings and magnetic recording heads.\r"

Thus, the definition of epitopes on M. leprae antigens that are recognized by T cells from different individuals might result in the development of an effective vaccine against leprosy. A sequence from the 65-kD protein of this organism was recognized by two HLA-DR2-restricted, M. leprae-specific helper T cell clones that were derived from a tuberculoid leprosy patient. Synthetic peptides were used to define this epitope as Leu-Gln-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-Leu-Asp-Lys-Leu. A similar peptide that was derived from the third hypervariable region of the HLA-DR2 chain, Glu-Gln-Ala-Arg-Ala-Ala-Val-Asp-Thr-Tyr, also activated the same clones. The unexpected cross-reactivity of this M. leprae-specific DR2-restricted T cell epitope with a DR2 peptide may have to be considered in the design of subunit vaccines against leprosy.\r"

Their amino acid sequence shows a high degree of homology with that of endothelin, a recently described 21-residue vasoconstrictor peptide found in porcine aortic endothelium. This is remarkable, since endothelin is a natural compound of the mammalian vascular system while sarafotoxins are highly toxic components of snake venom.\r"

The sedimentation profiles disclosed two classes of GlyR mRNAs, one heavy and the other light. The adult spinal cord was rich in heavy GlyR mRNA, whereas the light GlyR mRNA was more abundant in neonatal spinal cord and in adult cerebral cortex. Glycine receptors encoded by heavy and light mRNAs of adult spinal cord showed some electrophysiological differences. Thus there are two types of GlyRs encoded by mRNAs of different sizes, and the expression of these mRNAs is developmentally regulated. A tissue- and age-dependent distribution of heterogeneous GlyR mRNAs may imply diverse roles of the GlyRs in neuronal function in the central nervous system.\r"

With the cloning of the mutant genes and the characterization of their products, the mechanisms underlying phenotypic diversity are being deciphered. These mechanisms include (i) imprecise excision of transposable elements, which can result in the addition of amino acids to proteins; (ii) DNA methylation, which has been correlated with the activity of the element; (iii) transposase-mediated deletions within elements, which can inactivate an element or lead to a new unstable phenotype; and (iv) removal of transcribed elements from RNA, which can facilitate gene expression despite the insertion of elements into exons. An understanding of the behavior of the maize elements has provided clues to the function of cryptic elements in all maize genomes.\r"

  ".U": "89019379\r", 
  ".W": "Intracellular perfusion of atrial myocytes with adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio) triphosphate (ATP gamma S), an ATP analog, elicits a progressive increase of the muscarinic potassium channel current, IK(M), in the absence of agonists. In this respect, ATP gamma S mimics the actions of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) analogs, which produce direct, persistent activation of the guanyl nucleotide-binding (G) protein controlling the K+(M) channel. The effect of ATP gamma S on IK(M), however, differs from that produced by GTP analogs in two aspects: it requires relatively large ATP gamma S concentrations, and it appears after a considerable delay, suggesting a rate-limiting step not present in similar experiments performed with guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio) triphosphate (GTP gamma S). Incubation of atrial homogenates with [35S]ATP gamma S leads to formation of significant amounts of [35S]GTP gamma S, suggesting that activation of IK(M) by ATP gamma S arises indirectly through its conversion into GTP gamma S by cellular enzymes. ATP gamma S is often used to demonstrate the involvement of protein phosphorylation in the control of various cellular processes. The finding that cytosolic application of ATP gamma S can also lead to G-protein activation implies that experiments with ATP gamma S must be interpreted with caution.\r"

An outline of the origin and gradual acceptance of this idea is presented, and elementary transition-state theory is reviewed. It is pointed out that a misconception about the theory has led to oversimplification of the accepted expression relating catalysis and binding, and an amended expression is given. Some implications of the transition-state binding principle are then explored. The amended expression suggests that internal molecular dynamics may also play a role in enzymic catalysis. Although such effects probably do not make a major contribution, their magnitude is completely unknown. Two examples of recent advances due to application of the transition-state binding principle are reviewed, one pertaining to the zinc protease mechanism and the other to the generation of catalytic antibodies.\r"

Fourteen of the patients had abnormal SPECT studies. The abnormal findings were demonstrated by static views in eight patients, by the flow study in one patient, and by both sets of images in the other five patients. All abnormalities correlated with the clinical syndrome of presentation, and only two of the patients had no corresponding lesions on CT. Of the six patients with normal SPECT scans, two had abnormal CT studies, and in the other four, no lesions were shown at all. The ability of 99mTc DTPA SPECT to display cerebral infarctions appears to be, at best, comparable to that of CT. SPECT also provides qualitative information regarding flow dynamics in the affected hemisphere of some patients (6/20 in our review). This, we believe, represents the objective demonstration of the preexisting insufficient collateral flow in the hemisphere at risk for ischemic stroke.\r"

This review was done to ascertain the clinical significance of this uncommon entity. In 14 patients (44%), the aberrant pancreatic tissue was symptomatic; in the other 18 (56%), it was found incidentally. In the symptomatic group, the heterotopic pancreatic tissue was found in a duplication cyst of the ileum in one patient, in the common bile duct in one, in a Meckel's diverticulum in four, in the stomach in three, in a congenital duodenal diaphragm in one, in the duodenum in three, and in the ileum in one. The majority of heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the asymptomatic group was encountered in the jejunum (15 patients). Symptoms were related to complications, including obstruction of the common bile duct, mucosal ulcer with hemorrhage, intussusception, and intestinal obstruction, but not to pathologic conditions of the pancreas itself, such as pancreatitis or pancreatic cyst or neoplasm. In all of the clinically significant cases, the clinical symptoms disappeared completely after surgical removal of the aberrant tissue. In 28 cases (87%), diagnosis was made by frozen section during operation. Preoperative diagnosis of aberrant pancreas was not made in any of the cases. Histologically, all cases showed pancreatic excretory ducts; in 31 cases (97%), exocrine glands were present, and in 27 cases (84%), islets of Langerhans were discernible. There was no relationship between symptoms and the presence of islets, acini, or ducts. Mallory's phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin stain was used to demonstrate zymogen granules in the acinar cells, and insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin were demonstrated with the horseradish peroxidase-antihorseradish peroxidase immunocytochemical staining technique; islets of Langerhans were also identified. Technetium Tc 99m scintigraphy was used to detect the bleeding source in a Meckel's diverticulum and an enteric duplication associated with ectopic gastric mucosa.\r"

The rapid expansion of the AIDS epidemic, however, has made it essential for every physician and medical student to confront this issue and determine whether he is willing to accept the minimal risks of transmission posed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to health care workers. This paper will present five arguments in support of the contention that the physician is obligated to treat all those who would benefit from his care, even when such care entails personal risk to himself. These arguments include the historical traditions of the profession, formal ethical codes, the dependent nature of the patient, the social contract, and medicine as a profession.\r"

The computer group used a computer-assisted learning program, and the seminar group met weekly with a cardiologist to review electrocardiograms. Attendance at a minimum of 80% of the seminars or completion of 80% of the computer-assisted learning program was required for inclusion in the statistical analysis. The mean difference in test scores before and after study was 5.69 for the computer group and 4.36 for the seminar group (P less than .02 by one-tailed t-test). These results indicate that the computer group performed significantly better than the seminar group. We believe this difference to be educationally important.\r"

The agonist/antagonist ratio for extension/flexion is 1.30 and for rotation and side bending, motion to the right approximately equals motion to the left. Changes in the relative strengths of the different trunk muscle groups is affected by spinal pathology, and this is discussed.

Uroradiographic evaluation starting with retrograde urethrography is indicated in all male patients with concomitant gross hematuria, bloody urethral discharge, scrotal or perineal ecchymosis, a nonpalpable prostate on rectal examination, or an inability to urinate. If the urethra is normal, a catheter may be passed, and in the presence of gross hematuria, a cystogram must be performed. Female patients rarely suffer urethral lacerations. The urethra is examined, and a Foley catheter may be passed without a urethrogram. The immediate management of associated urologic injuries continues to evolve and evoke controversy. Selected cases of extraperitoneal bladder perforation may be safely managed solely by catheter drainage. Intraperitoneal perforations require surgical exploration and repair. Urethral disruption (partial or complete) may be safely managed by primary cystostomy drainage with management of potential complications (stricture, impotence, incontinence) in 4 to 6 months.\r"

In general, a conservative approach to treatment is recommended that may include an early surgical exploration when the risk of late hemorrhage is great and the kidney or a portion of the kidney has obviously already been lost. To treat all patients with surgery or with expectant treatment is illogical. If expectant treatment is elected and the patient has a significant renal injury, every effort should be made to follow the patient adequately with ultrasound or CT scans in order to identify at the earliest opportunity an expanding hematoma and prevent needless nephrectomy and shock. Of most importance is to avoid inadequate studies that fail to define the source of injury and lead in the long run to inadequate surgical management. A tongue-in-cheek representation of such a scheme of treatment is illustrated in Figure 5.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical management of urinary calculous disease has changed dramatically in the past decade. The development of percutaneous nephrostomy techniques has allowed new access to upper tract stones. Percutaneous removal of large calculi was made possible by the development of ultrasonic and electrohydraulic lithotripsy. All upper tract calculi can now be removed in 70 to 100 per cent of cases with minimal complications. Nephrostolithotomy has reduced transfusion rates and hospitalization costs and has markedly shortened convalescence periods compared with open surgery. Ureteroscopy followed nephrostolithotomy as advanced fiberoptic technology allowed the development of the small-caliber instruments required for this procedure. With experience, successful stone retrieval has occurred in 90 per cent or more of cases, again with minimal complications. As nephrostolithotomy and ureteroscopy have become available, the subspecialty of endourology has emerged and significantly changed the management of urinary tract calculi. Perhaps the most significant advance in stone therapy has been the design and implementation of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. With this noninvasive technique, most renal and proximal ureteral calculi can be effectively treated with minimal morbidity and convalescence. Research in lithotripter design is continuing, with more advanced and effective machines on the horizon. The applicability of extracorporeal therapy for the treatment of biliary tract calculi is currently under investigation. Finally, one should not disparage medical therapy for recurrent nephrolithiasis. A comprehensive metabolic evaluation combined with selective medical therapy provides almost complete relief from recurrent stone formation and makes medical therapy an integral component of treating the patient with renal or ureteral calculi.\r"

An indwelling urinary drainage catheter should be used only in patients who need multiple straight urinary catheterizations, develop urinary obstruction or incontinence, or are comatose and require frequent urinary output measurements. An indwelling catheter may also be needed for drainage or stenting during or following genitourinary surgery. Once it has been determined that urinary catheterization is necessary, a closed urinary drainage system catheter must be carefully and aseptically inserted by experienced hospital personnel after careful preparation. The closed drainage system must be meticulously maintained throughout the patient's hospitalization and catheterization. After the catheter is removed, a urinary culture should be performed to identify any postcatheter infection. If there is infection, the patient must be treated with antibiotics. If symptoms of a urinary tract infection, bacteremia, or sepsis ensue, treatment must be rapidly begun with antibiotics as appropriate on the basis of drug sensitivity testing. These techniques will not eliminate bacteriuria associated with urinary drainage catheters. However, they will reduce the incidence, morbidity, and mortality associated with urinary catheterization.\r"

The mechanisms of normal testicular descent are multifactorial and include an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis, as well as a normal gubernaculum and epididymis. In boys with cryptorchidism, the testes demonstrate degenerative changes histologically as early as 1 to 2 years of age. Both testes may be affected, even with a unilateral undescended testis. The most important long-term complications of cryptorchidism include infertility and testicular cancer. The risk of malignancy is 10 to 40 times higher in men with cryptorchidism than in normal men and is highest in men who have had an intra-abdominal testis and in certain intersex conditions. Orchiopexy does not appear to lessen this risk. In clinical trials in the United States, hormonal therapy with hCG or GnRH has not been effective in causing testicular descent; therefore, orchiopexy remains standard treatment. However, hCG is recommended if the clinician suspects that a testis is retractile. Orchiopexy should be performed between 12 and 18 months of age to prevent the degenerative changes that are demonstrable by 2 years.\r"

We prospectively studied 31 patients, comparing three thermodilution measurements of cardiac output at peak-inspiration, end-exhalation and random in mechanically ventilated patients. Patients were separated into two groups: group 1 was composed of intubated patients on intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) without spontaneous overbreathing, and group 2 included patients on IMV with spontaneous overbreathing. The results from this study demonstrated no statistical difference in the ranges or standard deviations of the measurements of cardiac output among injections initiated at random, peak-inspiration or end-exhalation in either group. We conclude that the reproducibility of measurements cannot be enhanced by initiating injections at specific moments in the respiratory cycle.\r"

The increased survival of very small premature infants in modern neonatal intensive care units has led to the resurgence of this potentially blinding disease. ROP appears to be a multifactorial disease, the prevention of which is probably impossible even now, with the most accurate methods of blood gas monitoring and oxygen restriction. In addition to oxygen, there are a number of significant risk factors, such as birth weight and gestational age, ventilator hours, hyper and hypocarbia, hypoxia and acidosis, xanthine therapy and probably bright light. Current data suggest that the level of antioxidants in the immature retina is relatively low and therefore oxygen radicals which accumulate in the preterm baby's retina may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ROP. The treatment of the disease in both its \"active\" and \"cicatricial\" stages emphasizes the need for a new classification which could serve as a common international language through which results may be compared. Vitamin E was suggested in some studies to be helpful in preventing the severe stages of the disease, but its efficacy has yet to be proved. Treatment modalities such as photocoagulation, cryotherapy and vitrectomy are being tried as a means of therapy in the more advanced stages of the disease. Preliminary results of a large multicenter study support the efficacy of cryotherapy.\r"

The preservation-related dialysis rate was 13.6%, and primary nonfunction occurred in 8 kidneys (1.6%). Actuarial patient survival in primary and secondary transplant recipients was 90% at 3 years. Overall primary graft survival was 81.6% and nonprimary graft survival, 61.1%.

Because of multiple predisposing factors, renal transplant patients are a high-risk group for the development of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. During a recent 18-month period, 290 renal transplants (79 living, 211 cadaveric donors) were performed and prospectively analyzed for colonic dysmotility. A total of 34 episodes of acute colonic ileus (30 primary, 4 recurrent) occurred in 30 (10.3%) renal transplant recipients. Acute colonic ileus was more frequent after living-donor transplantation (19.0% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.006). Analysis of multiple variables revealed that the incidence of acute colonic ileus was directly related to mean cumulative prednisone dosage (p less than 0.05). Medical therapy (rapid steroid reduction, bowel rest) resulted in a 76.7% response, whereas 8 patients underwent colonoscopy because of progression to acute pseudo-obstruction. The success rate for colonoscopic decompression was 87.5%; in 1 patient cecal perforation developed after unsuccessful decompression. Overall, 33 of 34 (97.1%) episodes of acute colonic ileus were successfully treated. Steroid-induced ileus (pseudo-obstruction) is a potentially malignant early form of colonic dysmotility infrequently reported in transplant recipients. Successful management requires early clinical recognition, reduction in steroid dosage, bowel rest, and urgent colonoscopic decompression in select cases.\r"

  ".W": "From January 1978 through December 1987, 22 patients underwent 23 renal autotransplantation procedures for the treatment of renovascular hypertension through the retroperitoneal approach. The causes of the renal artery stenosis were as follows: atherosclerosis (15), fibromuscular dysplasia (6), and Takayasu's arteritis (1). Indications for renal autotransplantation were as follow: disease extending into the renal artery branches (10), stenosis of multiple renal arteries (6), atherosclerotic aorta in high-risk patients (4), and stenosis of renal artery in children (2). The mean preoperative blood pressure of 205 +/- 6/109 +/- 3 mm Hg decreased significantly to 139 +/- 4/77 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The serum creatinine decreased significantly from a mean preoperative level of 2.2 +/- 0.8 mg/dl to a mean postoperative level of 1.4 +/- 0.4 mg/dl (p less than 0.05). Eleven patients with preoperative renal dysfunction had a significant decrease in the serum creatinine from a mean preoperative level of 3.4 +/- 0.3 mg/dl to a mean postoperative level of 1.9 +/- 0.2 mg/dl (p less than 0.001). One operative death occurred as a result of myocardial infarction. There were three postoperative complications, none of which affected the ultimate result in blood pressure or renal function. This experience demonstrates that in selected patients, renal autotransplantation is an excellent alternative in the surgical treatment of renovascular hypertension.\r"

Of the patients, 135 had no symptoms and 79 had a history of previous neurologic symptoms. In 139 sides duplex scanning demonstrated nonhemodynamic stenosis (lumen diameter reduction, less than 50%) and in 99 sides, hemodynamic stenosis (lumen diameter reduction, 50% or greater). Of the 238 carotid artery plaques examined, 167 were homogenous and 71 were heterogenous. During a mean follow-up of 34 months, 27 new focal neurologic deficits occurred. Patients with previous symptoms had a higher incidence of new deficits (18/79 vs 9/135) (p less than 0.01). The severity of the stenosis and the presence of a heterogenous plaque were statistically correlated with the occurrence of new deficits (p less than 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the ultrasonographic pattern and the severity of the stenosis were independent variables. We conclude that a heterogenous plaque should be considered an unstable plaque with the possibility of causing cerebral ischemia.\r"

Of the 1000 patients, three hundred two had definite histories of bleeding from esophageal varices before transplantation. There were 287 patients with nonalcoholic liver diseases and 15 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. All patients had very poor liver function, which was the main indication for liver transplantation. One- through 5-year actuarial survival rates of the 302 patients were 79%, 74%, 71%, 71%, and 71%, respectively. These survival rates are far better than those obtained with other available modes of treatment for bleeding varices when liver disease is advanced. Long-term sclerotherapy is the treatment of primary choice for bleeding varices. Patients in whom sclerotherapy fails should be considered for liver transplantation unless clear contraindications exist.\r"

At the Toronto General Hospital 415 patients undergoing elective laparotomy were randomly allocated to receive bupivacaine 0.25% (2 ml/cm incision), infiltrated into the fascia evenly along both sides of the incision before wound closure (202 patients), or to have closure without infiltration (213 patients). Chest x-ray (CXR) films of all patients were obtained preoperatively and on the second postoperative day. Pulmonary function studies were performed preoperatively and for the first two consecutive days postoperatively. CXR films were scored by a blinded observer. Postoperatively, 64% of the treatment group and 56% of the control group had evidence of atelectasis on CXR films (p = NS, chi 2 test). Both groups had similar decrements in vital capacity and expiratory reserve volume on the first and second postoperative days. There was no significant difference in the amount of analgesic taken in the first 24 hours, although the time to first analgesic was significantly longer in the treatment group (2.2 vs 1.3 hours, p less than 0.055). We conclude that infiltration of the fascia with 0.25% bupivacaine at a dose of 2 ml/cm of incision is not effective in preventing postoperative atelectasis. It does not reduce use of an analgesic although it may delay its initial requirement.\r"

We divided patients into three groups (peak CK within 2 days after admission) as follows: group 1, CK less than 400 U/L; group 2, CK = 400 to 2500 U/L; group 3, CK greater than 2500 U/L. Clinical myocardial infarction (MI) was determined by ischemic ECG changes, LDH isoenzyme patterns, and clinical course. Skin grafts occurred in 2 of 24 patients from group 1, in 15 of 31 from group 2, and in 37 of 61 from group 3. Hospital stay (mean +/- SEM) was 4.6 +/- 1.3 days for group 1, 20.2 +/- 5.4 for group 2, and 37.7 +/- 3.6 for group 3. Group 1 patients required no amputations; group 2 had 1 limb and 5 digit amputations; group 3 had 22 limb and 16 digit amputations. Only three clinical MIs were found (all in group 3), although 1 of 31 patients from group 2 and 32 of 61 from group 3 had CK-MB greater than 4%. Highly elevated CK and CK-MB are associated with longer hospitalization, and a greater risk of skin grafting or amputation, than with levels less than 400 U/L. Clinical MI is rare and cannot be diagnosed by elevated CK-MB alone.\r"

Thirty-three GI complications were identified in 25 patients who underwent cardiac surgery during a 7-year period (2.0% incidence). The mortality rate for patients having these GI complications was 44%. Acute acalculous cholecystitis was the most lethal complication (86%). Acute pancreatitis was the most common complication (eight patients). Most patients responded well to conservative measures. Five patients had upper GI hemorrhage and three had lower GI bleeding that required more than 2 U of packed red blood cells. All patient conditions were diagnosed endoscopically and none necessitated operation. Of the remaining patients, one was operated on because of perforated duodenal ulcer, one because of perforated diverticulitis, and one because of pseudo-obstruction of the colon, and one patient underwent diagnostic laparotomy and showed negative results for presumed acalculous cholecystitis. Liver failure was fatal in all three patients in whom it occurred. GI complications correlated significantly with advanced age, prolonged bypass times, valve surgery, and the female sex. We conclude that septic GI complications--particularly acute acalculous cholecystitis and perforated viscus--after cardiac surgery are uncommon but lethal. Clinical features are often subtle, and a high index of suspicion is necessary for an early diagnosis and the institution of appropriate treatment.\r"

Early technical complications and inadequate weight loss, well-known sequelae of this procedure, necessitated reoperation in 42 patients of 920 who underwent RGB in a 10-year period. Indications for reoperation included dilated gastrojejunal anastomosis (16), inadequate weight loss without demonstrable enlargement of the anastomosis (10), staple line breakdown (6), anastomotic obstruction (4), anastomotic leak (4), and enlarged proximal gastric pouch (2). Reoperation consisted of completely redoing the initial RGB in 20 patients, redoing the anastomosis alone in 17 patients, staple line revision in four patients, and intraoperative dilatation of the anastomosis in one patient. After initial RGB, 26 of the 42 patients (61.9%) experienced major complications. After revision of RGB, there were major complications in 21 patients (50%). In conclusion, major postoperative complications may contribute to RGB failure, RGB revision for early technical failure or inadequate weight loss is associated with a high incidence of major complications and, subsequently, negligible weight loss. Therefore repair of RGB for technical failure or complications is not recommended.\r"

Clinical assessment scores, body temperature, serum and sputum amoxycillin concentrations, and sputum culture results were recorded in each group. Erdosteine significantly increased antibiotic concentrations in sputum but not in serum. The combined treatment also caused a more rapid decrease in sputum viscosity and in body temperature and faster sterilisation of the sputum. These results show that erdosteine increases amoxycillin concentration in sputum in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. This effect may be due to a reduction in the viscosity of the bronchial secretions produced by erdosteine.\r"

Histamine has been compared with methacholine inhalation challenge in two samples of adults from a small town to determine which is the better agent for use in community studies. Increasing doses of histamine and methacholine were given, up to a maximum of 4 and 12 mumol respectively, according to the method of Yan et al, the provocative dose of agonist causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) being measured. More subjects had a measurable PD20 with methacholine than with histamine, both in a random sample of 108 subjects (25 v 11 subjects, p less than 0.01) and in an additional 95 subjects selected because of wheeze in the last 12 months (67 v 48 subjects, p less than 0.01). Side effects were mild with both agents but histamine caused voice change in more subjects (21% v 11%). Repeatability was assessed in a further group of subjects with wheeze in the last year. The 95% range for a single estimation of PD20 in subjects with a measured PD20 on at least one occasion was +/- 2.5 doubling doses for histamine (n = 25) and +/- 2.1 doubling doses for methacholine (n = 33). Thus methacholine has advantages over histamine for community studies of bronchial reactivity as it is possible to use doses that produce more PD20 measurements with fewer side effects.\r"

The dose of methacholine produced, on average, a fivefold increase in airway resistance. Immediately after methacholine inhalation the subjects underwent a progressive exercise test on a cycle ergometer (day 1) or voluntary hyperventilation (day 2) or remained resting (day 3). On the first day during exercise pulmonary resistance fell rapidly to baseline levels within two to three minutes and remained there for the 10 minute duration of the exercise. On day 2 voluntary reproduction of the same level and pattern of ventilation as during exercise resulted in a similar fall of resistance. On the third day, when the subjects remained at rest, pulmonary resistance remained raised for 10 minutes. It is concluded that the bronchodilator effects of exercise can be explained by the increased ventilation rather than the exercise itself, but with much smaller tidal volumes than have previously been thought necessary to reduce drug induced bronchoconstriction.\r"

He developed asthma within five months of returning to the workplace. Repeat challenge testing showed bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine and to the specific sensitising agent, toluene diisocyanate. This clinical pattern could be due to underlying toluene diisocyanate sensitivity with resolution and reappearance of hyperresponsiveness to methacholine and toluene diisocyanate reactivity associated with workplace toluene diisocyanate exposure. Alternatively, this worker may have developed sensitisation to toluene diisocyanate anew.\r"

The effect of the study medication on platelet aggregation was measured twice in each patient during the first 2 months and at each follow-up visit; the dose was individually adjusted. In 76% of the patients receiving aspirin, 50 mg/day gave satisfactory platelet inhibition, 13% needed 60 mg/day, 8% needed 70 mg/day, and 3% needed 100 mg/day. Platelet aggregation was found to be inhibited in only 1.2% of the measurements in the patients receiving placebo. Observation during treatment averaged 21 months; total intention-to-treat follow-up averaged 25 months. For the combined outcome events of transient ischemic attack, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and vascular death, aspirin reduced risk by 11% (95% confidence limits: -38% to 48%, p greater than 0.1).

Fourteen patients also had conventional angiography, and 14 had digital subtraction angiography. Ocular bruits by augmentation flow due to occlusion (seven bruits, 9.7%) or tight stenosis (17 bruits, 23.6%) of the contralateral internal carotid artery accounted for only 24 ocular bruits (33.3%). In contrast, siphon stenosis ipsilateral to the ocular bruit was a very common finding. All 14 patients studied with conventional angiography had variable degrees of siphon stenosis ipsilateral to the ocular bruits; there was one angiography failure. We conclude that siphon stenosis can cause ocular bruit alone or can act in combination with augmentation flow by contralateral carotid occlusion or tight stenosis. The difference in their relative occurrence in our patients compared with previous reports probably reflects racial differences in the distribution of stenotic or occluded lesions of the carotid artery between our patients and Caucasian patients. The ocular bruit was the only auscultatory finding in more than a quarter of our patients (14 of 50, 28%).\r"

Cortical pH for four regions in the ischemic middle cerebral artery territory of rats receiving verapamil or nimodipine was normalized (mean +/- SEM 6.90 +/- 0.02 and 7.01 +/- 0.01, respectively, for the parietal, sensorimotor, frontal, and auditory cortexes), while mean +/- SEM pH in rats receiving prostacyclin was 6.79 +/- 0.01; in untreated rats, mean +/- SEM pH in the same brain regions was 6.72 +/- 0.01. Local cerebral pH in the verapamil- or nimodipine-treated rats was thus significantly different from that in untreated rats (p less than 0.05). Local cerebral blood flow in treated rats was not different from that in untreated ones. Our findings suggest that calcium channel blockers correct ischemic cerebral acidosis by metabolic mechanisms rather than by changes in blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effect of a stable synthetic prostacyclin analogue, TRK-100, on the microcirculatory derangement occurring in feline pial vessels with endothelial damage after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Fifteen adult cats were divided into an untreated group (Group 1, n = 8) and a treated group (Group 2, n = 7). Thirty minutes after 10 minutes of ultraviolet irradiation, which selectively damaged endothelium in the pial vessels, the middle cerebral artery was occluded in both groups and maintained for 30 minutes. In Group 2, 50 ng/kg/min TRK-100 was continuously infused intravenously following ultraviolet irradiation. In both the pial arteries and veins, platelet aggregate adhesion to the endothelium with subsequent thrombus formation was significantly (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively) inhibited during middle cerebral artery occlusion in Group 2 compared with Group 1. Similarly, blood flow stasis in the pial veins was effectively prevented in Group 2 during occlusion. Furthermore, the pial artery diameter returned to the control level during the late period of occlusion, whereas in Group 1 the pial artery remained constricted. Our data suggest that TRK-100 can prevent microcirculatory derangement in the acute stage of ischemic stroke.\r"

In the group with white matter signal abnormalities, we noted a higher frequency of extracranial carotid artery disease, a lower mean gray matter blood flow (F1), and a significant reduction (p less than 0.05) in blood flow of the slow-flowing (F2) compartment. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac diseases (p less than 0.002) were found more often in this group. Our results indicate that a higher incidence of changes known to be associated with an increased risk for stroke exists in the presence of white matter lesions in normal elderly individuals.\r"

As expected, the whole kidney mean transit time was found to be very sensitive but, due to the low specificity, not very helpful in the distinction between obstructed and nonobstructed kidneys. The cortical transit reflected, in some cases, the favorable surgical outcome. In other cases, however, it could not be considered as a reliable parameter of the clinical status, since it was found to be normal preoperatively and prolonged postoperatively in patients whose parenchymal function improved significantly after surgery and who had their clinical symptoms relieved.\r"

Reduced intake of saturated fat and cholesterol can lower total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 10-20 percent, while several medications lower total and LDL cholesterol by 15-40 percent. A highly effective cholesterol-lowering medication, lovastatin, has been recently marketed. The efficacy and long-term safety of ingesting large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil supplements are unproven. Hypercholesterolemia is a family problem transmitted between generations by various combinations of genetic factors and learned behaviors. The family physician can be most effective by working with entire families to detect and treat hypercholesterolemia early in life to prevent serious consequences of prolonged cholesterol elevation.\r"

Receiver-operating-characteristic curves were used to compare diagnostic criteria at significant stenosis levels, and to select threshold values that emphasize specificity as well as sensitivity. Peak systolic velocity, systolic velocity ratios, and end-diastolic velocity were all shown to be equivalent predictors of significant disease. We chose peak systolic velocity in the internal carotid artery as our best parameter because of its ease of measurement. The use of combined parameters offered no significant statistical advantage over the use of a single parameter. The real-time assessment of stenosis and ulceration was not found to be reliable. ROC curves should be used to select Doppler criteria with desired sensitivities and specificities to maximize the benefit in each clinical setting.\r"

Gd-DTPA, the most extensively studied agent, has been shown to improve the conspicuity of acute myocardial infarcts on MR images in experimental animals and humans. However, this agent is limited as a marker of perfusion because of its rapid elimination by renal excretion and equilibration within the extracellular fluid space. Future investigation of Gd-DTPA as a myocardial perfusion agent may involve rapid-scanning techniques to define time-dependent accumulation of the contrast agent in normal and ischemic myocardium during the first pass after IV injection. Nondiffusable paramagnetic agents and agents with prolonged retention in myocardium are being studied actively, but further tests of toxicity and metabolism are needed before clinical trials. Additional macromolecular-bound metal chelates will be tested in the future. It is hoped that these agents will allow detection of the jeopardized region of myocardium in the setting of acute ischemia, before the onset of myocardial edema.\r"

The tumor was shown by CT in 69%, by sonography in 47%, and by cholangiography in 97% of patients. Three radiographic types of cholangiocarcinoma were identified: infiltrating stenotic (69%), bulky exophytic (19%), and polypoid intraluminal (12%). CT correctly staged 54%, sonography 50%, and cholangiography 58% of tumors as resectable (40%) or unresectable (60%). The sensitivities in detecting unresectability with CT, sonography, and cholangiography were 44%, 19%, and 43%, respectively; specificities were 78%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. CT and sonography combined with cholangiography increased the sensitivities to 64% and 50%, respectively. CT and sonography were complementary to cholangiography because they helped determine the extrabiliary extent of these tumors and therefore provided information on resectability.\r"

Golytely-RSS is a new formulation designed to taste better through reduction in sodium and sulfate content. In addition, a slight increase in osmolality is intended to decrease further the net absorption/secretion ratio. One hundred outpatients who were to undergo air-contrast barium enema examinations were randomly assigned one of two colon-cleansing preparations. A standard 1-day diet/cathartic method was compared with Golytely-RSS plus oral bisacodyl. Radiographs were evaluated for the amount of fecal material present and the degree of mucosal coating by two radiologists independently of each other and without knowledge of the preparation used. Good to excellent feces removal was provided by Golytely-RSS in 98% of patients and by the standard method in 95% (p greater than .1, not significant). Mucosal coating also was similar between groups. Unpleasant side effects were reported significantly more often in the lavage group. Unwillingness to use the preparation a second time was reported in 36% of the Golytely-RSS group and in 8% of the standard preparation group (p = .03). Golytely-RSS is an acceptable alternative method to standard colon-cleansing methods for air-contrast barium enema and may be preferable in patients with certain renal or cardiovascular diseases. Side effects may preclude the use of this colon-cleansing regimen routinely.\r"

A propagation speed artifact was seen in seven lesions, all of which were composed primarily of fat and larger than 4 cm. CT identified fat-density tissues in all lesions. Contrast-enhanced CT showed positive attenuation values in the two predominantly myeloid tumors. CT appears to be sensitive for the diagnosis of adrenal myelolipomas.

The finding of either an actual-to-expected femur-length ratio of 0.91 or less or a nuchal-fold measurement of 6 mm or more detected Down syndrome with a sensitivity of 42% and a specificity of 88%. The positive predictive value for Down syndrome detection when using femur-length shortening alone was greater than that when using the combination of femur-length shortening and nuchal-fold thickness.

Fetal abnormalities included gastrointestinal and CNS malformations. Oligohydramnios was often present. The absence of a stomach on fetal sonograms obtained after 14 weeks gestational age strongly suggests fetal abnormality. Repeat sonograms should be obtained in all such cases.\r"

  ".W": "The small size of the head and abdomen in a growth-retarded fetus may lead to inaccurate estimates of gestational age. Therefore, we conducted a study to assess the diameters of the aortic root and pulmonary artery in such fetuses. During the study period, we measured these great vessel diameters at the level of the semilunar valves on all third-trimester obstetric sonograms in which intrauterine growth retardation was suspected. Cases were included in the study if delivery occurred within 1 week of the scan and if growth retardation was confirmed after birth. The study population consisted of 75 growth-retarded fetuses. We compared the relationships between great vessel diameters and gestational age in this study population with norms previously established in our laboratory in 403 normal fetuses. In a similar fashion, we compared the relationships between great vessel diameters and biparietal diameter in our study population with previously established norms. We found no significant difference between great vessel diameters in growth-retarded fetuses and those in normal fetuses of the same gestational age (p greater than .45 for aorta; p greater than .40 for pulmonary artery). In contrast, aortic root diameter was larger in relation to biparietal diameter in growth-retarded fetuses than it was in normal fetuses (p less than .05), and there was a tendency toward the same result for the pulmonary artery. We conclude that the diameters of the aorta and pulmonary artery remain normal in most cases of intrauterine growth retardation. The aorta and pulmonary artery may be useful predictors of gestational age when growth retardation is suspected.\r"

Recently, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy has been advocated as a safer, quicker, less expensive method in children. We report our experience with 16 percutaneous gastrostomies in 14 infants and children; in all cases, both sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance were used. Four patients had had previous surgical gastrostomy in which the tubes could not be replaced once they were removed. The remaining patients were referred for percutaneous placement of gastrostomy tubes as the first procedure. In 13 procedures, parenteral sedation and local anesthesia were used; the remaining three procedures were done with the patient under general anesthesia. Tubes were successfully placed in all procedures. In two patients, tubes became dislodged, necessitating a second procedure. There were no instances of local infections, hemorrhage, or peritonitis, and none of the patients died. Two patients had postprocedure septicemia, which responded to antibiotics. Percutaneous nonendoscopic gastrostomy can be safely and effectively performed in infants and children.\r"

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has already proved useful to identify patients with \"white coat\" hypertension or \"office\" hypertension, whose hearts appear normal by echocardiography. Further research is needed to determine the relative predictive value and comparative cost-effectiveness of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiography for identification of patients in whom hypertension does or does not constitute a cardiovascular disease that requires antihypertensive therapy.\r"

Casual pressure measurements in the physician's office can be affected by alarm reactions, thus causing \"white coat\" hypertension. ABPM allows one to evaluate these reactions and determine the average pressure and variability of BP along with the effects of physical activity and emotional arousal on BP patterns while at work, at home, and during sleep. Average pressures determined by ABPM are more predictive of target organ involvement and cardiovascular complications of hypertension than casual monitoring of BP in the clinic. The absence of physiologic decline in arterial pressure during sleep is associated with increased prevalence of atherosclerotic complications and left ventricular hypertrophy as well as impairment of the autonomic nervous system. Although further prospective studies are needed to confirm the benefits of home pressure readings and ABPM, ABPM can be helpful in the diagnosis and determination of prognosis and therapeutic responses in a select group of patients.\r"

The arrhythmia frequency established during the initial baseline has previously been reported to change during a second placebo monitoring period in patients with non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, but the extent to which this applies to patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia has not been examined. To extend these observations to patients with potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias, we studied 53 patients enrolled in one of two investigational antiarrhythmic drug trials that introduced a second single-blind placebo period (placebo-pulse) an average of 16 months after successful arrhythmia suppression. Thirty-eight of the 53 patients had runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia recorded during the initial baseline (placebo I) period, with 63% averaging greater than or equal to 10 runs per day. There was a marked reduction in the arrhythmia frequencies between the two placebo periods: 55% for ventricular premature beats, and 77% for pairs (p less than 0.001, respectively). Of the 38 patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, there was a 72% reduction (892 +/- 531 vs 245 +/- 18 runs of VT/day, placebo I vs II; p = 0.0001), with 32% having total suppression of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during the second placebo period. The results of this trial extend our previous observations of long-term spontaneous changes in arrhythmia frequency to patients with symptomatic, potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia and support the recommendation for periodic reassessment of baseline arrhythmia frequency to determine the continued need for antiarrhythmic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These patients had participated in a randomized trial comparing intravenous anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) (n = 123) and intracoronary streptokinase (n = 117) therapy. Reperfusion occurred in 59 of 115 (51%) patients receiving APSAC and 67 of 111 (60%) patients receiving streptokinase (p = NS). There was greater early resolution of ST segment elevation in the reperfused than in the nonreperfused patients (p less than or equal to 0.003) and more rapid Q wave evolution (p less than or equal to 0.03). Sigma Q was lower in reperfused than in nonreperfused patients at 8 hours (1.41 +/- 1.18 versus 2.11 +/- 2.10 mV; p less than or equal to 0.05) and at 24 hours (1.43 +/- 1.25 mV versus 2.08 +/- 1.88 mV; p less than or equal to 0.02).

Peak LDH-1 was lower in the reperfused group (274 +/- 149 U/L versus 341 +/- 173 U/L; p less than or equal to 0.04). Reperfusion at a mean of 3.9 hours after the onset of infarction was associated with more rapid resolution of ST segment elevation, faster Q wave evolution, smaller ECG infarct size, earlier cardiac enzyme release, and smaller enzymatic infarct size than later or no reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (20 mg/kg, intravenously administered) on the time course of functional recovery of myocardium following a 15-minute coronary artery occlusion period and subsequent 5 hour reperfusion period were studied in chronically instrumented, conscious dogs. In comparison to a control group, animals receiving methylprednisolone 90 minutes prior to coronary occlusion demonstrated less depression of regional segment shortening following 15 minutes of reperfusion (52 +/- 13% vs control levels of 23 +/- 7% of preocclusion values) and improved recovery at 5 hours postreperfusion (106 +/- 6% vs control levels of 54 +/- 4% of preocclusion values). In animals receiving methylprednisolone immediately prior to reperfusion, there was also similar recovery of segment shortening at 5 hours (97 +/- 3%). In contrast, dogs receiving methylprednisolone 15 minutes after the onset of reperfusion or sodium succinate (5.5 mg/kg, intravenously administered) 90 minutes prior to occlusion demonstrated no improvement in recovery of function. Experiments in dogs not subjected to coronary occlusion documented that methylprednisolone sodium succinate lacked inotropic and vasodilator properties. The results suggest that methylprednisolone administered prior to or during coronary artery occlusion but not after reperfusion enhances the functional recovery of hypokinetic, postischemic, reperfused myocardium. These effects are unrelated to any direct hemodynamic action of steroids or to the sodium succinate salt.\r"

  ".W": "Episodes of myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease may be due to transient increases in coronary vasomotor tone superimposed on a fixed atherosclerotic obstruction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether identification of the clinical pattern of angina could predict the therapeutic response to the addition of nifedipine to a regimen of beta blockers and/or long-acting nitrates. Seventy-two patients with stable exertional angina were divided into two groups: \"classic exertional angina\" (17 patients), defined as exertional angina with a stable threshold; and \"mixed angina\" (55 patients), defined as exertional angina provoked by a variable threshold and/or at least two episodes of rest angina within the 3 months prior to screening. Patients were studied with nifedipine and placebo in a 6-week, double-blind, crossover design that used serial anginal diaries, exercise treadmill tests, and 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring. In patients with mixed angina, nifedipine reduced the frequency of angina compared to that during placebo treatment (13.1 vs 9.9 episodes/3 weeks, p less than 0.01) and reduced nitroglycerin consumption (11.7 vs 7.5 tablets/3 weeks, p less than 0.05); while in patients with classic exertional angina, nifedipine had no symptomatic effect (7.9 vs 6.8 anginal episodes/3 weeks, NS; 6.4 vs 5.8 nitroglycerin tablets/3 weeks, NS). Patients in both groups experienced a significant decrease in the manifestations of ischemia during exercise testing. Patients with mixed angina experienced a reduction in the daily frequency of painful episodes of ST segment depression during nifedipine treatment compared to placebo (0.6 vs 0.2 episodes, p less than 0.05), but there was no effect on the frequency of episodes of silent ischemia (4.2 vs 3.4 episodes, NS). In patients with classic exertional angina, the addition of nifedipine had no effect on any measure of ambulatory ischemia. We conclude that patients with mixed angina are more likely to benefit symptomatically from the addition of nifedipine therapy than patients with classic exertional angina. The lack of a consistently preferential response to nifedipine in patients with mixed angina, however, suggests that episodic coronary vasoconstriction may not be the only mechanism responsible for ischemia in these patients, and/or that nifedipine may not necessarily provide additional therapeutic benefit beyond that conferred by a regimen of beta blockers and/or nitrates.\r"

All patients received placebo for 4 to 6 weeks, followed by randomization to diltiazem or captopril during the double-blind monotherapy phase. Either study drug was titrated over 6 weeks to achieve a goal supine diastolic BP reduction of at least 10 mm Hg and a diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg. Patients achieving the goal BP reduction were maintained on monotherapy for an additional 8 weeks. Patients not achieving the treatment goal after 8 weeks with either drug alone received the other drug in combination, titrated to achieve goal BP response. Both drugs lowered BP significantly and, at the doses used, diltiazem had a greater effect on diastolic BP than did captopril. The mean changes from baseline at week 8 were -10.6 and -7.3 mm Hg, respectively, (p = 0.01). Goal BP was achieved in 38% of patients taking diltiazem monotherapy and in 34% of patients taking captopril monotherapy. There were no significant differences between diltiazem and captopril in diastolic or systolic BP reductions by race or age. The addition of alternate therapy for non-goal achievers at week 8 resulted in significant reductions in diastolic and systolic BP by week 16.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of diuretics to increase serum glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as the adverse changes in triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol produced by nonselective beta blockers, have been largely ignored in the treatment of hypertension. However, a number of trials have shown that reductions in serum lipids can alter cardiovascular mortality. Calcium antagonists have become major drugs in the treatment of hypertension, and some data suggest that calcium antagonists may increase serum glucose levels. Significantly less data on lipid effects have been published. Lipid and glucose effects were examined in an 8-week antihypertensive study using a sustained-release preparation of diltiazem titrated from 240 to 360 mg/day in a twice-daily regimen in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 96 patients. Average supine blood pressure at week 8 was 156/98 mm Hg, standing blood pressure with placebo 152/100 mm Hg, and with diltiazem 147/91 and 144/93 mm Hg. There were no statistically significant changes in serum lipids or glucose in the diltiazem or placebo group or between the groups. Mean values (mg/dl) at baseline and week 8 in the diltiazem group were, respectively, for cholesterol 215 and 218, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 50 and 51, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 128 and 133, triglycerides 169 and 175, and glucose 113 and 110. Thus, this large and placebo-controlled study shows that diltiazem is among the antihypertensives with no adverse long-term lipid or glucose effects.\r"

  ".W": "A question of major clinical significance in cardiology is the nature of the signals that initiate and maintain the various types of myocardial hypertrophy, either in response to hemodynamic loading or in the absence of altered load. This review suggests that the proto-oncogene model, a concept derived from the study of cancer, can be very useful in identifying these signals. The proto-oncogene model conceives of cell growth regulation in terms of a limited number of classes of critical regulatory proteins: growth factors, growth factor receptors, intracellular transducing proteins and ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcription factors. Growth of all cells has dissociable components: hypertrophy (growth in size), deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, mitosis and cytokinesis. Hypertrophy may be the end result of activation of RNA transcription. The various types of hypertrophy could reflect transcription of specific myocyte genes in response to different growth factors. At least 1 member of each functional class of proto-oncogenes has been detected in the myocardium or myocytes, or both. The alpha 1-adrenergic receptor has been shown to be a growth factor receptor and to regulate RNA transcription. Continued work on proto-oncogenes in myocytes may open the way to manipulate the growth of these cells.\r"

  ".W": "The cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster has a genetically transmitted form of dilated cardiomyopathy and is an important paradigm of myocardial disease, particularly for studies addressing the earliest stages of myocardial dysfunction. This model exhibits an increase in cardiac sympathetic tone in the presence of an altered expression of sarcolemmal calcium channels or of alpha 1 receptors, and a defective handling of calcium by both cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Increased expression of the oncogene c-myc is evident in cardiomyocytes before any overt evidence of heart disease. Alterations in a nuclear phosphoprotein, which appears to be important in the regulation of gene expression, have also been identified. The disease becomes phenotypically manifest by the development of microvascular spasm, reperfusion injury and myocyte loss. Myocyte loss, in turn, burdens the remaining cells with an increasing load, increasing sympathetic stimulation, myocyte hypertrophy and further cell loss--a continuing vicious spiral that culminates in the development of myocardial failure. All of the features of hamster cardiomyopathy may be prevented by the administration of verapamil or prazosin to juvenile hamsters before the phenotypic onset of their heart disease. This understanding has led to the study of new imaging agents that promise the detection of such forms of cardiomyopathy in their earliest stages and a means by which the effects of therapy can be assessed. If such mechanisms are applicable to human cardiomyopathy, early treatment of patients with adrenergic antagonists or calcium antagonists should be beneficial.\r"

These drugs have different pharmacologic effects and are not interchangeable. Previous studies suggested that all calcium antagonists bind to a 170 kd polypeptide (now called the alpha 2 subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel). The apparent molecular weight of this polypeptide characteristically decreased from 170 to 140 kd upon disulfide reduction as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Recent studies demonstrated that calcium antagonists bind to a previously unrecognized 165 kd polypeptide (alpha 1 subunit) that does not change its electrophoretic mobility on disulfide reduction. Because of their similar molecular weights, the 2 polypeptides may overlap each other on polyacrylamide gels. The primary structure of both polypeptides clearly shows, however, that they are different from each other and only the alpha 1 subunit has the features expected of an ion channel.\r"

  ".W": "Recent data demonstrate that in addition to its conduit function, the blood vessel is an active synthetic and secretory organ containing several autocrine and paracrine systems that are involved with the local regulation of its own function (i.e., structure and growth). The endothelium secretes vasorelaxant and vasoconstrictive substances, growth factors and inflammatory mediators that exert paracrine influences on vascular myocyte function. The vascular myocyte also expresses autocrine substances that influence its own function. The autocrine systems include angiotensin, prostaglandins, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor and heparin. These local factors exert modulatory influences on myocyte contractility and growth. These autocrine and paracrine systems serve as an adaptive mechanism by which the vasculature autoregulates its structural and functional state. We speculate that an alteration in this delicate balance of these local factors, due to genetic or acquired abnormalities, can result in increased vascular tone and vessel hypertrophy and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension.\r"

In the anesthetized dog, renin secretion was decreased by renal arterial infusions of calcium chloride and calcium gluconate; aldosterone excretion was not affected. In the sodium chloride-deprived rat, dietary calcium chloride loading decreased plasma renin activity, whereas calcium gluconate did not. Both calcium salts increased aldosterone production. In the non-filtering, denervated, papaverine-treated dog kidney, renin release was stimulated by renal arterial infusion of verapamil. In the rat, chronic oral verapamil administration decreased plasma aldosterone but had no effect on renin. In humans, chronic oral verapamil decreased aldosterone responsiveness to infusion of angiotensin II. Thus, in vivo renin release is inhibited by hypercalcemia and stimulated by blocking calcium transport; conversely, aldosterone production is stimulated by a high calcium intake and inhibited by blocking calcium transport. These effects of calcium on renin and aldosterone may have implications for understanding the putative relation between calcium and hypertension.\r"

In this model, contraction is a complex process involving Ca2+ release, protein kinase C and ionic channel activation and modification in pH and energy metabolism. The combined action of these processes is necessary for the full expression of the contractile response.\r"

Based on recent experimental studies, it is suggested that at similar levels of systemic hypertension, glomerular injury only develops when pre-glomerular resistances are ineffective, thus allowing the development of glomerular hypertension. The mechanisms by which the hemodynamic stress of elevated intracapillary flows and pressures leads to progressive glomerular damage, particularly to the development of focal glomerulosclerosis is currently unknown. Endothelial cell injury, increased mesangial traffic or trapping of macromolecules and epithelial cell injury, or a combination, appear to occur early, followed by in situ inflammatory and microthrombotic mechanisms. This may explain why various therapeutic approaches, whether dietary or pharmacologic, can have salutory effects despite their diverse mechanisms of action.\r"

  ".U": "89022820\r", 
  ".W": "Calcium antagonists decrease the ability of the kidney to autoregulate renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Therefore, when afferent renovascular resistance is elevated, as in essential hypertension, there is a resultant increase in RBF and GFR with the administration of calcium antagonists. These agents also induce a marked natriuresis because of direct tubular action through unknown mechanisms. The natriuresis can be dissociated from renal and systemic hemodynamic actions, indicating that the decreased sodium reabsorption could override other compensatory mechanisms explaining the absence of sodium retention during the treatment. The renal effects of converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) can be explained by the reduction of intrarenal formation in angiotensin II. Because the activation of the renin-angiotensin system is mainly responsible for inducing sodium retention during a decrease in systemic blood pressure, CEIs could have a protecting effect without disturbing other homeostatic mechanisms. CEIs decrease efferent glomerular resistance, reducing capillary pressure and thereby reducing GFR. This effect is not translated in sodium retention because the reduction of GFR is mild during captopril administration in kidneys with normal or increased renal perfusion pressure. At low renal perfusion pressure, the reduced glomerular afferent vasoconstriction can compromise GFR, leading to renal insufficiency. Although these situations are not likely to be encountered during the treatment of uncomplicated essential hypertension, in severe hypertension with hypertrophy of pre-glomerular vessels, glomerular perfusion may decrease. Combination therapy of calcium antagonists and CEIs has been reported to be an effective treatment of severe hypertension. Currently, little information is available on the manner in which renal function is affected by simultaneous administration of both drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium antagonists are unique antihypertensive drugs that appear to exert selective blood pressure-lowering and possibly renal hemodynamic and functional effects in hypertensive patients and animals. There is evidence for inhibition of tubular sodium reabsorption and renal vasodilatation when certain of these agents are given by acute intravenous or intrarenal arterial administration. These renal effects have been observed to occur either independently or together. Both natriuresis and diuresis have been found to occur with these drugs. In the deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertensive dog, chronically administered diltiazem reduces blood pressure, transiently increases renal blood flow and increases urine volume. Administered either acutely or chronically to these hypertensive dogs, diltiazem depresses renal vascular reactivity. Pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II and norepinephrine are attenuated to a similar degree. The chronic blood pressure-lowering effect of diltiazem is most likely a function of depressed vascular reactivity; however, actions at other sites cannot be ruled out based on our experiments. Postprandial renal vasodilatation readily occurs in the conscious instrumented dog, and although this response is blocked by the acute administration of a calcium antagonist, the response is unaltered during the chronic administration of diltiazem.\r"

If this progression is correct, it is not surprising that, as medicine studies living organisms with increasing sophistication, factors that are initially discovered to have systemic effects are, in many instances, later determined to have paracrine, autocrine or even intracellular (\"intracrine\") effects. This schema is potentially of value in analyzing the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and, in particular, the development of the sequelae of hypertension. A case is made for the idea that the actions of common peptide and nonpeptide factors at local tissue levels can play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis and left ventricular hypertrophy. In making this case, the potential roles of insulin, angiotensin II and other vasoactive factors are considered. In addition, it is argued that some peptide and nonpeptide factors with cardiovascular impact may operate in the intracellular environment, thus broadening prospects for study and intervention. Finally, genomic alterations either spontaneously occurring or resulting from chronic stimulation or viral infection are considered and their potential role is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Two subsets of patients with essential hypertension have been identified based on their sensitivity to dietary sodium intake: the salt-sensitive and the salt-resistant patients. The renal function curve in salt-resistant patients is shifted to higher blood pressure levels but it remains parallel to that of normal subjects. On the contrary, the slope of the renal function curve in salt-sensitive patients is considerably depressed. It is postulated that this derangement may be related to an abnormal relation between sodium intake and sympathetic nervous system activity. It is also postulated that a link exists between abnormalities of sodium and calcium metabolism in hypertension and that reduced renin release, increased sympathetic activity and reduced renal sodium excretion in salt-sensitive patients may be related to a defect in sodium-linked cellular calcium transport. Calcium antagonists revert the derangements in the renal function curve and in renin release in salt-sensitive patients.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium antagonists are an important group of drugs in the treatment of systemic hypertension. Examination of the factors that determine the magnitude of antihypertensive response to calcium antagonists is of interest for clinical and basic pathophysiologic reasons. Possible factors influencing response include drug dose, plasma drug concentration, plasma renin activity, baseline blood pressure, nonionized calcium in blood and inside vascular smooth muscle cells, patient age and patient race. Published studies have examined the determinants of antihypertensive response. The striking fact about many of these studies is that they fail to control for other possible factors that might influence response. This article reviews the methods used and the results of 23 different studies that examined the determinants of response to calcium antagonists. Possible relationships between plasma renin activity, intra- and extracellular calcium levels, and the antihypertensive response, are of interest from a pathophysiologic point of view. From a clinician's standpoint, the only determinants that matter are the dose of the drug and the degree of elevation of the blood pressure. In this regard, calcium channel blocking drugs are no different from other drugs that act by peripheral vasodilation.\r"

  ".W": "Whole-day automated monitoring with small portable devices allows the circadian pattern of blood pressure to be assessed conveniently in individual patients. Measurements provided by this technique appear to be more reproducible and physiologically relevant than conventional office readings. Ambulatory monitoring can enhance the evaluation of antihypertensive therapy, especially in clinical trials, in 3 ways. First, it can facilitate the diagnosis of hypertension and avoid potentially inappropriate treatment in patients whose hypertension is erroneously diagnosed by office measurements. Moreover, the monitoring technique appears to prevent placebo responses in therapeutic studies. Second, whole-day monitoring allows clear quantification of treatment effects. Because the standard deviations of treatment-induced blood pressure differences are lower with this method than with conventional readings, valid statistical evaluation of antihypertensive effects can be performed with far fewer patients. Finally, duration of action of drugs can be measured. By dividing the day into sequential periods (typically 12 two-hour periods), it is possible to determine statistical differences between baseline and treatment blood pressure values throughout the dosing intervals of the drugs being tested. This method may be more sensitive than the traditional \"peak and trough\" approach for assessing duration of action; it is not influenced by unsuspected discrepancies between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs, and can also provide information on nighttime effects. Thus, automated whole-day blood pressure monitoring appears to be a powerful tool for the evaluation of antihypertensive therapy.\r"

  ".U": "89022829\r", 
  ".W": "Premature ventricular complexes and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia mark a person with structural cardiac disease as a high--risk candidate for sudden cardiac death. Such ventricular arrhythmias are considered potentially lethal and should be distinguished from both those that are benign and those that cause hemodynamic consequences (i.e., lethal or malignant arrhythmias). Noninvasive Holter monitoring is the principal technique for detecting and evaluating the presence of potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. These arrhythmias undergo a high degree of spontaneous variability. Thus, to define a therapeutic drug effect, a reduction in the frequency of premature ventricular complexes of at least 75% and a reduction in the frequency of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia by at least 90% are required to eliminate the likelihood of spontaneous variability as the cause of this change in the frequency of arrhythmia. To define proarrhythmia, a different algorithm must be applied. When using antiarrhythmic drugs, a quantitative ventricular arrhythmia baseline for both frequency and type of arrhythmia must be established so that after therapeutic intervention repeat Holter monitoring can determine whether efficacy, inefficacy or proarrhythmia had occurred. Holter monitoring clearly reveals differential antiarrhythmic response rates among classes of antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with benign or potentially lethal arrhythmias. However, preliminary data have not clearly defined the relation between antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapy and a reduction in sudden cardiac death. The results of large-scale clinical trials that have only recently been undertaken must be assessed to determine whether sudden cardiac death can be prevented by adequately suppressing potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "The success or failure of antiarrhythmic drug treatment depends, in part, on the selection of the initial dosage. Too low a dosage can lead to unnecessary (and frequently life-endangering) delays in achievement of arrhythmia suppression. Conversely, an excessively high dosage can lead to intolerable toxicity and cessation of treatment. The recommended approach to therapy is to begin with a relatively low dosage, i.e., the lowest dosage with a reasonable chance of producing a favorable response, and titrating the dose upward as needed. Dose titration should be guided by clinical response and, when appropriate, concentrations of the drug and any active metabolites in the plasma. In situations frequently encountered in practice, however, the initial dosage must be modified because of interindividual differences in drug disposition. These changes in drug pharmacokinetics can arise from a variety of factors, including disease processes (e.g., congestive heart failure, cirrhosis and renal failure), concomitant medications (e.g., hepatic enzyme inducers such as phenytoin and inhibitors such as amiodarone), drug formulation, protein binding and inherited drug metabolism capacity. Knowledge of these factors can help the clinician to avoid potential pitfalls in initial dosage selection and can enhance the changes of successful drug treatment of arrhythmias.\r"

  ".U": "89022831\r", 
  ".W": "Exercise testing has been widely applied for the evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease. The principles underlying its use for this indication make it a useful adjunctive technique, when combined with ambulatory monitoring, to diagnose arrhythmias and monitor antiarrhythmic drug therapy. During exercise, there is a withdrawal of vagal tone and a marked increase in circulating catecholamines and sympathetic inputs to the heart. These changes may directly cause arrhythmias (e.g., catecholamines can enhance automaticity and delayed afterpotentials and can shorten myocardial conduction time and refractory periods). However, they also augment myocardial oxygen demands by increasing myocardial inotropy, heart rate and blood pressure. Such changes may cause ischemia in patients with heart disease, which is a powerful stimulus for arrhythmia, or lead to dysfunction in left ventricular contraction and increased myocardial wall stress, factors that also may precipitate arrhythmia. In approximately 10% of patients with a history of serious arrhythmia, exercise represents the only means for exposing arrhythmia. Importantly, this technique is useful for evaluating the effect of antiarrhythmic drugs. These agents work by reducing membrane automaticity, slowing impulse conduction through the myocardium and prolonging membrane refractoriness. In contrast, catecholamines, which are secreted in response to exercise, have the opposite effect. Thus, exercise may negate the important effects of the antiarrhythmic drugs. Additionally, exercise testing may expose potentially serious toxic drug reactions that may not be obvious at rest. These include conduction abnormalities, negative inotropic effects, congestive heart failure and aggravation of arrhythmia. Although the presence and frequency of arrhythmia with exercise is highly variable in patients with benign arrhythmia, results are more consistent in patients with a history of serious arrhythmia. If arrhythmia is reproducibly provoked with exercise, this technique can be used to judge drug effect. Thus, exercise testing is an important, reliable and helpful technique for exposing arrhythmia, evaluating drug efficacy and identifying potentially serious toxic drug effects.\r"

  ".W": "Electrocardiographic monitoring can be a useful adjunct to antiarrhythmic therapy, since the electrocardiogram is a simple indicator of net cardiac drug effect, irrespective of factors such as pharmacokinetic variability, drug-metabolite interactions or intraindividual variability in drug sensitivity. Changes associated with antiarrhythmic drug therapy include markers of sodium channel block, such as increased QRS or sinus-ectopic coupling intervals and increased QT interval, a marker of action potential prolongation. Electrocardiographic changes can serve 3 purposes: They can correlate with arrhythmia suppression, they may be a guide to impending drug toxicity, and they can indicate the presence of an antiarrhythmic drug at some electrophysiologically active site in the heart. This latter indication may be used as an assessment of compliance, as a clue to drug-drug interactions that may lower antiarrhythmic drug concentrations or preparatory to electrophysiologic testing when it is desirable to avoid testing patients who have no demonstrable drug effect. Drug-induced changes in the microelectrophysiologic environment may sometimes fail to express themselves on the surface electrocardiogram. Overall, however, the electrocardiogram is an inexpensive, readily available tool to monitor net antiarrhythmic drug effects on the heart. Monitoring of the electrocardiogram should, therefore, be an integral part of managing antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients with arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "The use of electrophysiologic studies has contributed significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and enhanced our ability to assess objectively the efficacy of various therapeutic interventions in modifying or preventing their recurrence. The basis on which electrophysiologic testing techniques is founded is the ability reproducibility to initiate ventricular arrhythmias by programmed electrical stimulation in patients with a history of recurrent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Ventricular tachycardia can be initiated by electrophysiologic studies in approximately 90% of patients with clinically documented recurrent, sustained ventricular tachycardia related to coronary artery disease and in 60% of patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Reports indicate that electrophysiologic testing is highly specific as well (99% for sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia). Studies in patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia demonstrate that prevention by antiarrhythmic drugs of the ability to initiate tachycardias that were previously inducible by comparable stimulation techniques in the absence of therapy is highly predictive of freedom from recurrent episodes of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. This end point can be achieved in 35 to 75% of patients. This wide range of success rates results from differences in the patient populations studied, as well as major differences in the programmed stimulation and antiarrhythmic drug protocols used among laboratories. The positive predictive value of this technique (defined as the percentage of patients in whom complete suppression of inducible ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation is achieved during electrophysiologic testing with antiarrhythmic drugs and in whom no spontaneous arrhythmia occurs at 1- to 2-year follow-up) ranges between 80 and 95%.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma concentration monitoring of antiarrhythmic agents is valuable, but it is often misused or overemphasized in therapeutic decision-making. There are strict requirements for its appropriate use that are often not met--for both the newer and even the conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. For maximum value, there must be a reliable, accurate relation between the plasma drug concentration and drug action, a relation closer than that between dosage and drug action. The time of sample collection is important--most guidelines are based on \"trough\" plasma concentrations measured after steady-state equilibrium has been achieved. The use of an accurate, sensitive and specific assay is crucial to the value of plasma concentration monitoring guidelines. However, for agents having active metabolites, monitoring the concentration of only the parent drug can be misleading and limits (but does not necessarily eliminate) the value of plasma concentration monitoring guidelines for these agents. Plasma concentration monitoring of most antiarrhythmic agents is of value for certain specific purposes: to determine compliance to antiarrhythmic therapy, to detect and analyze possible drug interactions, to assess the benefit to risk ratio for increasing the dose of a particular antiarrhythmic agent, to maintain a stable drug effect in the presence of a patient's changing clinical condition and, to a limited extent, to assess the role of an agent in causing an adverse drug reaction. The importance of understanding the assay methods currently in use, as well as how plasma concentration monitoring of individual antiarrhythmic agents is affected by the presence of active metabolites, optical isomers differing in their activity and variations in protein binding, is essential in interpreting data obtained from plasma concentration monitoring.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and necropsy findings in 138 patients (69 men and 69 women) with rupture of the left ventricular (LV) free wall during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (rupture group) were compared with 50 patients who died during their first AMI without rupture (nonrupture group). The frequency of systemic hypertension (55 vs 52%), angina pectoris (13 vs 22%) and congestive heart failure (0 vs 0%) before the fatal AMI was similar for both rupture and nonrupture groups. Mean heart weights for men (479 vs 526 g) and women (399 vs 432 g) with and without rupture also were insignificantly different. LV scar before the infarct that ruptured was present in 18 patients (13%); previous necropsy studies of fatal AMI without rupture have indicated that 50% have LV scars. The rupture group had a significantly more frequent (p less than 0.01) lateral wall location of the infarct (12 vs 2%). The number of 3 major (right, left anterior descending and left circumflex) epicardial coronary arteries narrowed at some point greater than 75% in cross-sectional area by atherosclerotic plaque was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in the rupture group (39 vs 58%). The percent of these 3 arteries totally occluded or nearly so (greater than 95% in cross-sectional area) by plaque also was significantly less (p less than 0.001) in the rupture group (24 of 198 arteries [12%] vs 38 of 144 arteries [26%]). Analysis of each 5-mm long segment of these arteries in each group disclosed that the rupture group had significantly less narrowing than the nonrupture group. Of the 3,287 five-mm segments of artery examined in the rupture group (66 patients), 512 (15%) were narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area by plaque; in contrast, of the 1,848 five-mm segments in the nonrupture group (38 patients), 508 (28%) were narrowed to this degree by plaque (p less than 0.0001). Thus, rupture of the LV free wall primarily is a complication of the first AMI and is associated with considerably less amounts of coronary narrowing than fatal AMI without rupture.\r"

At the Stanford University Medical Center 356 heart transplant procedures were performed in 329 patients by the end of January 1985. Eighty-nine of these patients developed evidence of transplant CAD. Twenty retransplant procedures, including 2 third transplants, were performed in 19 of the 89 patients because of transplant CAD. The graft survival rates after the second transplant were 55%, 25% and 10% after 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively. Nine of these retransplant patients currently survive, the longest for 5.5 years. To examine potential risk factors for development of severe transplant CAD, these 20 retransplant procedures were compared with 113 transplant recipients who had no evidence of transplant CAD on annual coronary arteriograms. An excess of rejection episodes (3 +/- 2 vs 2 +/- 1 episodes/patient, p = 0.02), elevated total cholesterol (266 +/- 78 vs 225 +/- 47 mg/dl, p = 0.002) and higher low-density lipoprotein levels (176 +/- 88 vs 137 +/- 46 mg/dl, p = 0.009) were noted in the transplant CAD retransplant group. Five of 11 retransplant recipients who survived greater than 1 year again developed transplant CAD.

The phasic coronary artery flow velocity in patients with AR showed increased S wave and decreased D wave.

Treatment regimens were variable: five patients had splenectomy and received chemotherapy; five patients had splenectomy alone; and four patients had chemotherapy alone. Seven patients received interferon, and one patient received no treatment. In those six patients who had multiple biopsies as part of follow-up examinations, hairy cells as identified by anti-LCA were continuously present. Often in significant numbers, and were usually underestimated or not identified by routine examination.

It has been shown that the renin-angiotensin II cascade stimulates new vessel formation. The presence of renin in several types of highly vascularized neoplasm suggests that it may also be implicated in the mechanism of tumor angiogenesis. In order to study the possible relationship of renin to GBM, immunohistochemical search for human renin was carried out in ten instances of such a tumor. Eight of these cases demonstrated renin-containing neoplastic astrocytes, whereas seven cases of reactive gliosis and six cases of low-grade astrocytoma revealed no renin-containing cells. The immunostaining was not present after preabsorption of the renin antiserum with pure human renin or substitution of preimmune serum for the specific renin antiserum. Because it has also been demonstrated that a product of renin, angiotensin II, has angiogenic properties, it seems reasonable to postulate that renin, through angiotensin II, may play a role in the mechanism of GBM-associated neovascularization.\r"

The tumor recurred in the lower orbita-zygoma region, and multiple tumors of the lungs and hypercalcemia were detected eight months after the second operation. The recurrent tumor resembled the primary tumor but was less well differentiated. Autopsy revealed widespread lung metastasis of the malignant ameloblastoma, nephrocalcinosis, and sigmoid colon cancer. Histologic examination showed the metastatic ameloblastoma to be composed of nests and strands of basaloid and spindle-shaped cells surrounded by columnar cells arranged in palisade formation, with focal areas of squamous differentiation and occasional cystic degeneration. Only two cases of malignant ameloblastoma with hypercalcemia have previously been reported. This is the first case of malignant ameloblastoma with hypercalcemia and sigmoid colon cancer. In addition, prostaglandin E2 assay revealed that ameloblastoma produces prostaglandin E2, which results in hypercalcemia.\r"

Similarly, MT1, MT2, and UCHL1 react with fixation-resistant T-cell-restricted antigens. In order to evaluate the diagnostic potential of these antibodies, the authors have assessed their immunoreactivity with a series of 81 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (48 B-cell, 33 T-cell) encompassing a wide variety of histologic subtypes, which had been fully characterized by frozen-section immunophenotyping. Ninety-six percent of B-cell lymphomas reacted with one or more of the B-cell-associated antibodies, whereas 100% of T-cell lymphomas reacted either with MT1, UCHL1, or both antibodies. MT2 was of no value in distinguishing between B- and T-cell lymphomas. None of the antibodies was entirely lineage specific; furthermore, a proportion of cases failed to react with one or more of the B- or T-cell-associated antibodies. Although these antibodies provide useful information in distinguishing between T- and B-cell lymphomas, the authors suggest that a panel of these antibodies is necessary for accurate determination of the histogenesis of these tumors. As with any immunohistochemical marker, interpretation of the immunostaining must be in the context of the morphologic features.\r"

One patient presented with a right submaxillary salivary gland mass and the other presented with a T7-8 spinal cord compression resulting from a vertebral body tumor. A lymphoblastic leukemic phase developed in both patients after 15 months and 5 months, respectively. The bone marrow blasts of both patients had positive results for cluster designation (CD) 10, CD19, HLA-DR, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Because both extranodal sites of presentation and non-T-cell immunophenotype are unusual in adult MLLB, these features may have contributed to the original misclassification of these lesions.\r"

A retrospective study was performed to determine the frequency of occult bacteremia in simple febrile seizures. In a pediatric emergency department, we identified 115 cases of simple febrile seizures in children treated as outpatients. Blood cultures were performed in 93 (81%) of 115 patients; five (5.4%) were positive. Children were less likely to have blood cultures performed if they were older than 24 months or had a medical history of simple febrile seizures. However, neither age nor history of febrile seizures affected the risk of bacteremia. These data suggest that patients with simple febrile seizures are at approximately the same risk for bacteremia as children with fever alone. Patients with simple febrile seizures should be treated in the same manner as other patients of the same age with regard to the performance of blood cultures.\r"

The main considerations in the differential diagnosis in preschoolers with inadequate language are hearing loss, mental deficiency, dysphasia, and autistic spectrum disorders. Attention to the child's ability to engage in symbolic play and communicate meaningfully is the key to this often baffling differential diagnosis. With the exception of definitive assessment of hearing, classic medical investigations are seldom informative because structural brain lesions and metabolic errors are much rarer etiologies than prenatal and genetic influences on brain development. While many children improve with age, the underlying deficit(s) usually persists. The role of the physician is to detect the developmental problem, give the parents a correct diagnosis, refer the child for appropriate investigation and intervention, and provide follow-up and counseling. Early diagnosis is essential for effective remediation.\r"

We also review the findings in 23 children with the diagnosis of SS whose cases were reported in the literature. We propose that the following criteria for the diagnosis of SS, which are mostly used in adults, should also be applied to children: (1) keratoconjunctivitis evidenced by a Schirmer test and a quantitative rose bengal test; (2) xerostomia shown by a decreased basal and stimulated salivary flow; (3) lymphocytic infiltration in a minor salivary gland biopsy specimen with at least two foci per 4 mm2; (4) laboratory evidence of a systemic autoimmune disorder on the basis of a rheumatoid factor of 1/160 or greater, antinuclear antibody of 1/160 or greater, or extractable nuclear antigen antibodies. Only close observation and long-term follow-up of these patients will allow a better insight in the natural history of SS in children. Those children who do not fulfill these diagnostic criteria also need close and prolonged follow-up study: one of the possibilities is that their conditions will ultimately evolve toward definite SS.\r"

Although right coronary arteries originating from the left sinus of Valsalva and passing between the aorta and pulmonary artery are less frequently associated with symptoms, this condition may be associated with sudden death. The incidence of symptoms associated with other anomalous origins is also discussed.\r"

The Birchalls lied regarding Benwell's subsequent movements. Questioning Pelly revealed to Detective John Murray that both Pelly and Benwell had replied separately to Birchall's advertisement for young men of means to become partners with him in a large Canadian farm, a deposit first being required. Birchall had been observed taking Benwell from Buffalo, New York, to Blenheim Swamp, for in reality there was no farm. There he had shot Benwell, leaving the body partially exposed. He then tried unsuccessfully to lure Pelly to his death in Niagara Falls. The Birchalls were arrested. Reginald Birchall was tried, convicted, and hanged. His attempt, including murder, to turn the so-called farm pupil colonization scheme to his own benefit had been frustrated by the dogged work of the master Canadian detective Murray.\r"

Twenty-four such patients underwent bypass grafting, 20 dialysis patients and four who had been transplanted. Bypass grafting completely or partially relieved symptoms in 83%. The hospital mortality associated with this surgery for the 20 dialysis patients was 20% compared with a lower overall hospital mortality for bypass grafting in nondialysis patients of 1.3%. Greater hospital mortality was noted for patients over age 60 undergoing bypass grafting, 33.3% v 1.9% in nondialysis patients. In this study, the most significant factor associated with mortality was older age. We conclude that bypass grafting has an acceptable mortality in younger end-stage renal disease patients anticipating or having had renal transplantation, but it is associated with a high hospital mortality in older dialysis patients.\r"

We have evaluated leukocyte infiltrates (number of cells/mm2) in the renal interstitium of 21 patients with Berger's disease and eight normal kidneys with monoclonal antibodies and a four-layer immunoperoxidase technique. In our population of patients, the number of infiltrating T-lymphocytes (OKT11+ cells) was significantly higher (median, 132) than in the normal kidneys (median, 60). This increase was mainly due to T-suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes (OKT8+ cells; median, 68), while T-helper/inducer lymphocytes (Leu 3A+ cells) and monocytes were in the normal range. T-lymphocyte infiltration was more marked in ten patients with impaired glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the time of biopsy (median, 167) than in patients with normal GFR (median, 88). In addition, ten patients who showed deterioration of renal function during the subsequent follow-up, whatever their serum creatinine levels at the time of biopsy, had significantly more total T cells (median, 269), OKT8+ cells (median, 143), and Leu 3A+ cells (median, 105) than 11 patients with persistently stable GFR and normal controls. More data are necessary to establish whether this T-lymphocyte infiltration is the consequence of a cell-mediated mechanism acting in the interstitium, concomitant with the immune-complex-mediated mechanism acting in the glomerulus, or is a nonspecific consequence of the tubulointerstitial damage induced by the immunologically mediated glomerular disease.\r"

B2-microglobulin accumulation leading to systemic amyloidosis may be the most recent disease in this category. This case report documents the development of bilateral popliteal tumors in a patient undergoing chronic hemodialysis for 9 years. Removal of one of the tumors and pathological examination demonstrated amyloid that was positive for B2-microglobulin by specific antibody testing. This case adds further support to the suggestion that B2-microglobulin amyloidosis in chronic hemodialysis patients is truly a systemic disorder. The development of popliteal tumors, particularly in proximity to joints, in a chronic hemodialysis patient, must include amyloidosis in the differential diagnosis.\r"

DNA sequences from the IRP locus that recognize RFLPs are proving to be highly informative for prenatal diagnosis.

Both the analysis of extended haplotypes and the pairwise measures of linkage disequilibrium among the RFLPs indicate that there is extensive linkage disequilibrium in the INS/IGF2 region. The disequilibrium extends across the hypervariable region (HVR) located just 5' to the INS gene and encompasses a region of at least 40 kbp. Previous studies had suggested that linkage disequilibrium in the INS region was negligible and that this region may therefore contain a \"recombinational hotspot\" (Chakravarti et al. 1986). However, results of this and another recent study (Thompson et al. 1988) highlight the importance of the frequencies of associated alleles in the ability to detect linkage disequilibrium. Thus, the previous failure to detect disequilibrium in the INS region may have reflected a lack of power, rather than a true absence of disequilibrium in this region.\r"

  ".U": "89023163\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Cryptococcus neoformans causes infections in up to 10 percent of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Nearly 50 percent of AIDS patients with previously treated cryptococcal meningitis will experience a relapse within six months. To reduce the likelihood of relapse, a maintenance regimen of amphotericin B is often administered weekly. However, the drug's intravenous route of administration and considerable toxicity have led to a search for alternative antifungal agents. In this report, we document our experience with fluconazole, a new oral triazole antifungal agent. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients with AIDS and various forms of cryptococcosis were treated in an open-label study with 50 to 400 mg/day of fluconazole. The following laboratory studies were done on a monthly basis: complete blood cell count, liver function tests, serum creatinine level, serum cryptococcal antigen level, and serum fluconazole level. Lumbar puncture was performed in patients with meningitis every four to eight weeks to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen, India ink preparation findings, fungal culture, fluconazole level, and protein, glucose, and cell count. RESULTS: Of seven patients with active culture-positive infections, four showed clinical and microbiologic responses (three of four with meningitis, one of three with extraneural cryptococcosis). Fifteen patients who had already undergone successful amphotericin B therapy for either meningitis (n = 14) or pneumonia (n = 1) received fluconazole as prophylaxis against relapse. Fourteen patients remained free of infection during 11 to 64 weeks of suppressive therapy; one patient with meningitis experienced relapse after 26 weeks of treatment. Reverse reactions were limited to increases in hepatic enzyme levels in four patients. CONCLUSION: These results appear sufficiently encouraging to warrant further trials of this oral agent in the suppression of chronic cryptococcosis and perhaps in the treatment of acute infection.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Because of the increasing numbers of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who will require treatment for cryptococcosis and because of the problems associated with long-term administration of intravenous amphotericin B, an alternative therapeutic approach in the form of an efficacious and easily administered oral antifungal drug would be of great benefit. Fluconazole, a new triazole antifungal agent, represents such an alternative. We therefore conducted an open, non-randomized trial of oral fluconazole as maintenance suppressive therapy of disseminated cryptococcosis in patients with AIDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with AIDS, 19 of whom had cryptococcal meningitis, were studied. Patients were followed for up to 21 months. All patients received amphotericin B as primary therapy, from 20 to 257 days prior to entry (500 to 5,080 mg total dose). Eight also received flucytosine. After administration of amphotericin B for acute disseminated cryptococcosis, and prior to initiation of fluconazole therapy, Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in two patients and from the blood in one patient. Fluconazole was given once daily, in doses of 50 to 200 mg/day. RESULTS: Following initiation of fluconazole, results of CSF and blood cultures continued to be negative, except for the CSF culture in one patient who had a relapse in the 32nd week of therapy. Fluconazole therapy has been successfully continued in nine patients, for a median of 11 months (nine to 21 months). Seven patients died; five had no evidence of active cryptococcosis at the time of death. Two patients had a relapse, although the CSF culture showed growth of the fungus in only one patient. One patient was lost to follow-up after five months of therapy and one was unevaluable. Fluconazole had to be discontinued in only one patient in whom thrombocytopenia developed, and then resolved when the drug was stopped. CONCLUSION: We conclude that oral fluconazole represents a significant advance in the management of cryptococcal meningitis and should be useful in the long-term suppressive therapy of this opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The development of life-threatening hyperkalemia poses a risk for patients with chronic preterminal renal failure. Various therapeutic options have been suggested for hyperkalemic emergencies in these patients; to date, however, no study has evaluated the relative efficacies of these measures in the presence of renal failure. Our goal was to examine the acute effects of a variety of therapeutic approaches, as well as those of hemodialysis, on plasma potassium levels in a hemodialysis population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with terminal renal failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. Blood gas parameters and plasma sodium, potassium, glucose, osmolality, renin, aldosterone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and insulin were measured before, during, and after 60-minute infusions of bicarbonate, epinephrine, and insulin in glucose, and before, during, and after performance of regular hemodialysis for one hour. RESULTS: Hypertonic as well as isotonic intravenous bicarbonate (2 to 4 mmol/minute) induced a marked rise in plasma bicarbonate and pH, but failed to lower the plasma potassium level (5.66 versus 5.83 mmol/liter before and after). Epinephrine, 0.05 microgram/kg/minute administered intravenously, decreased plasma potassium only slightly from 5.57 to 5.25 mmol/liter, and five patients showed no decline. On the other hand, insulin in glucose, 5 mU/kg/minute intravenously, effectively lowered plasma potassium levels from 5.62 to 4.70 mmol/liter, and hemodialysis induced the most rapid decline from 5.63 to 4.29 mmol/liter. Plasma aldosterone was elevated before treatment; it correlated with plasma potassium and dropped during intravenous bicarbonate administration or hemodialysis. Pretreatment plasma renin activity, insulin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels were generally normal. CONCLUSION: We conclude that in patients with terminal renal failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, intravenous bicarbonate is ineffective in lowering plasma potassium rapidly, and epinephrine is effective in only half the patients, whereas insulin in glucose is a fast and reliable form of therapy for hyperkalemic emergencies. Plasma aldosterone levels are appropriate in relationship to plasma potassium levels, and levels of other potassium-influencing hormones are generally normal.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Multifocal atrial tachycardia is a difficult arrhythmia to treat. Patients not showing a response to the correction of predisposing conditions present a therapeutic dilemma. To assess the efficacy of two agents reported to be effective in this condition, verapamil, metoprolol, or placebo was given intravenously in a randomized, double-blind trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients meeting inclusionary criteria were enrolled. Therapeutic response was defined as conversion to sinus rhythm, a decline in the ventricular rate of 15 percent or more [corrected], or a ventricular rate of less than 100 beats/minute. Four male and nine female patients having a mean age (+/- SD) of 81.9 +/- 14.2 years were enrolled. Automated serum chemistries, complete blood cell count with differential, arterial blood gas values, and serum digoxin and theophylline levels were determined and a 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at the start of the trial. Following the completion of each phase of the study, a repeat physical examination was performed, and arterial blood gas values and an electrocardiogram were obtained. The trial was designed to run for two days. RESULTS: Two of 10 (20 percent), four of nine (44 percent), and eight of nine (89 percent) showed a response to placebo, verapamil, or metoprolol, respectively. Mean slowing of ventricular rate was 3.4, 7.3, and 24.5 percent for placebo, verapamil, and metoprolol, respectively (p less than 0.01 for metoprolol versus placebo). Five patients who showed a response to metoprolol had failed to have a response to verapamil. CONCLUSION: We conclude that metoprolol appears to be more effective than verapamil in treating multifocal atrial tachycardia. However, careful patient selection is necessary in its use.\r"

  ".W": "In the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, locally produced antibodies complex with an inciting antigen, yet to be identified, within the joint and activate the complement system, resulting in articular inflammation mediated primarily by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and their products. Chronic inflammatory cells then produce soluble factors that induce both tissue destruction and inflammation. A major issue is how and why apparently normal immune responses in the acute stage progress to chronic inflammation in subsequent months to years. Although it is often assumed that the initial etiologic agent, persisting in the joint or at an extra-articular site, is responsible for continued synovitis, this need not be the case. It is possible that once the inciting agent is cleared from the joint through a normal immune response, the presence of activated cells rich in surface class II histocompatibility (Ia) antigens could, under the influence of multiple genetic or environmental factors, become the target of autoimmune attack. Alternatively, the process might result from the interactions of synovial lining cells and their products with T cells assuming a secondary role. Further research into the relative contributions of soluble products, T helper and suppressor subsets, synoviocytes, and antigen determine which model is correct.\r"

Hydroxychloroquine may best be employed to treat patients with new onset of disease or those in whom disease is not rapidly progressive. Great potential exists for the use of hydroxychloroquine in combination therapy, but optimal utilization of combination regimens will require performances of additional controlled studies.\r"

Approximately 15 percent of patients with rheumatoid arthritis are seronegative for rheumatoid factor by standard assays. The development of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for additional isotypic and idiotypic determinants may expand the diagnostic sensitivity of rheumatoid factor measurements. Although extremely sensitive, the finding of antinuclear antibodies is not highly specific for systemic lupus erythematosus and related disorders; the ability to rapidly screen serum against newly characterized specific nuclear antigens has been helpful in the diagnosis of newly described systemic lupus erythematosus subtypes, overlap syndromes, Sjogren's syndrome, and scleroderma variants. Women with unexplained recurrent fetal loss and patients with unexplained thrombotic episodes should be screened for the presence of the anticardiolipin antibody. Glycoproteins (C-reactive protein, alpha-1-glycoprotein, fibronectin) may prove useful as indicators of rheumatic disease activity and the efficacy of therapeutic intervention.\r"

  ".U": "89023211\r", 
  ".W": "Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are used to modify or alter the rheumatoid arthritis disease process. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs do not demonstrate the characteristic analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory actions of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, since weeks or months of treatment are required before clinical benefit is observed. Although they have not been proved to delay, prevent, or reverse articular damage, therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, when successful, is associated with decreased pain and joint swelling and improved function. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and cytotoxic agents should not be considered as routine treatment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Before disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy is implemented, an optimal basic program of physical therapy, rest, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be implemented, and it must be documented that the patient still has sufficient disease to justify the costs, risks, and benefits of these treatments. Drugs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are preferred over nonapproved drugs. Hydroxychloroquine, parenteral gold salts, oral gold, D-penicillamine, and the cytotoxic drug azathioprine are the FDA-approved disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for use in rheumatoid arthritis. Many, not all, rheumatologists would employ hydroxychloroquine as the first-choice disease-modifying antirheumatic drug in patients who have early, mild, and nonerosive disease; treatment should be continued for six months before being abandoned for lack of efficacy, and appropriate ophthalmologic examination every four to six months is indicated. An alternative would be auranofin, whose efficacy approaches that of parenteral gold, yet may be safer. For patients who have severe active rheumatoid arthritis, especially with erosive changes, parenteral gold salts are usually a first choice. D-penicillamine is also effective in controlling the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, but serious toxicity may occur. Azathioprine might be considered a competitor to D-penicillamine, although the FDA approval restricts its use to patients who have failed gold therapy. Two cytotoxic drugs that are not FDA approved are methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. Methotrexate can be very effective, but its side effects, particularly pulmonary and hepatic, must be carefully monitored. Cyclophosphamide is generally considered too toxic for use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, although it may be helpful in patients with systemic rheumatoid vasculitis or patients who have failed all other therapies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These reports suggest that antimalarial drug toxicity is less than that of parenteral gold, D-penicillamine, auranofin, or dapsone. Its efficacy appears to be equal to or slightly less than that of most comparison DMARDs. Combinations of DMARDs with antimalarials are probably used by a substantial proportion of rheumatologists, but the few prospective, double-blind studies with a balanced design show little or no advantage to combination DMARD therapy. Open, nonrandomized studies and preliminary reports suggest that combination therapy may be useful, usually when another DMARD is added to one or more DMARDs to which the patients did not have a satisfactory response. A few large, prospective, double-blind, randomized studies comparing hydroxychloroquine with several other DMARDs and placebo are needed to establish more confidence in the relative efficacy and utility of hydroxychloroquine. Although the rationale for combination DMARD therapy is attractive, additional preliminary studies of the various possible combinations and doses are needed before definitive trials of promising combinations can be justified.\r"

The purpose of this study is to identify the circulating renin inhibitor. Plasma initially was fractionated with preparative sephacryl S-300 chromatography. A fraction with low protein content inhibited the in vitro enzymatic activity of human renin by 76%. The inhibitory activity of this fraction was not altered by boiling and/or acidification. This fraction was applied to an affinity column, using purified mouse submaxillary renin as ligand. The inhibitor was recovered after elution with hypertonic NaCl. Linoleic acid, a previously identified renin inhibitor, was present in this fraction. The authors conclude that circulating linoleic acid inhibits renin. Conceivably, the overall activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade may be modified by alterations of plasma fatty acid concentrations.\r"

The premature ventricular complex (PVC) hypothesis has been the cornerstone for understanding this problem, but it is now recognized as an incomplete explanation for this catastrophy. The recognition of the importance of structural heart disease in this process has led to the development of the Substrate Hypothesis as an alternative explanation. In this construct, PVCs may trigger lethal arrhythmias but only if an abnormal electrophysiologic substrate is present. This hypothesis more completely describes the pathophysiology of the process, provides the basis for understanding the value and limitations of the techniques used for risk assessment and management, and helps clarify the potential endpoints and potential adverse effects of therapy to prevent arrhythmias. Since no single diagnostic technique is ideal and no therapeutic modality is universally effective, an approach to the management of this problem must be multidimensional and based on a firm understanding of the actual risk of a life threatening arrhythmia, the potential but unproven benefits and uncertain endpoints of drug therapy, the cost, and the potential for arrhythmia exacerbation or significant side effect.\r"

Only 2.9% of the 978 tests had abnormal results (score less than or equal to 7). When performed within 2 days before birth, a normal biophysical profile predicted the 1-minute Apgar score to be normal in 92% and 5-minute Apgar score in 99%. When all biophysical profiles ever performed were included, the predictive value improved to 100%. The baby's first cry within 1 minute after birth was predicted in 95%. Furthermore, the predictive value of a normal biophysical profile regarding the absence of ominous intrapartum cardiotocographic patterns was excellent (95%). The specificity was in general good (80% to 90%), but the predictive value of abnormal test results and sensitivity were almost without exception poor. It seems that the very low rate of abnormal biophysical profiles indicates that obstetric interventions were made immediately after the occurrence of the first sign of fetal jeopardy; thus improved results were obtained.\r"

This study uses transvaginal sonography to evaluate the ovaries in postmenopausal women who were scheduled for gynecologic surgery unrelated to adnexal disease. The findings of ultrasonic ovarian examination are compared with the findings at surgery and the pathologic evaluation of the ovaries. Nine (17.3%) abnormal ovaries were identified by ultrasonography and at surgery and were confirmed at pathologic examination. Among the abnormal ovaries there were one malignancy (10%) and two neoplasms with known malignant potential (20%). One ovary that was identified to have microscopic areas of Brenner tumor cells at pathologic examination was described as normal by both ultrasound and surgical evaluation. The sensitivity (90%) and specificity (100%) of vaginal sonography were the same as that of gross examination of the ovary at the time of surgery. We conclude that vaginal sonography is a reliable tool in the detection of early abnormalities in the postmenopausal ovary.\r"

  ".W": "Corticotropin-releasing hormone was measured in the plasma of 110 pregnant women and in the umbilical cord plasma of 25 premature infants and 43 infants born at term. Mean maternal plasma corticotropin-releasing hormone was undetectable (less than 41 pg/ml) until mid-second trimester, rose to a mean of 204 +/- 24 pg/ml by 30 weeks' gestation, to 326 +/- 41 by 35 weeks, and then rose sharply near term, with a mean of 2930 pg/ml at 38 to 40 weeks' gestation. Sequential measurements in seven pregnant women confirmed that plasma corticotropin-releasing hormone rose in a predictable pattern, with a dramatic increase in the final weeks of pregnancy. There was little hour-to-hour variability in maternal plasma concentrations. Corticotropin-releasing hormone was also detectable in umbilical cord plasma; mean corticotropin-releasing hormone was 194 +/- 44 in the preterm infants and 150 +/- 19 in the term infants. The corticotropin-releasing hormone extracted from both the maternal and fetal circulation was biologically active in vitro and caused the dose-dependent release of adrenocorticotropic hormone and beta-endorphin from cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. A significant correlation was found between maternal plasma corticotropin-releasing hormone and cortisol levels the morning after betamethasone administration, a finding that supports a physiologic role for maternal plasma corticotropin-releasing hormone. We conclude that the placenta secretes large amounts of biologically active corticotropin-releasing hormone into both the maternal and fetal circulation during pregnancy. We demonstrate that this corticotropin-releasing hormone is secreted into the maternal plasma in a reproducible pattern during normal term pregnancy and suggest that sequential corticotropin-releasing hormone measurements may prove to be of clinical utility. In addition, placental corticotropin-releasing hormone may be an important modulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during pregnancy.\r"

Such an approach is particularly desirable in cases where measurements of other biometric parameters are precluded, for example, in diseases such as anencephaly, hydrocephalus, and short limb dysplasia. A significant correlation was found between fetal foot length and gestational age (r = 0.9, p less than 0.0001) and between fetal foot length and femur length (r = 0.9, p less than 0.0001). Ossification centers of the calcaneus and talus were all present by the twenty-second week of gestation. However, their measurements discriminated between gestational ages of 18 to 22 weeks. The utilization of fetal foot length and heel ossification centers will serve as a useful adjunct in the estimation of gestational age and possibly in the diagnosis of diseases affecting the fetal foot.\r"

In the detection of severe erythroblastosis fetalis, sonographic evaluation of fetal anatomic changes is being used in association with amniotic fluid spectral analysis to assess the degree of the hemolytic process. In 1981 it was reported that sonographically detected umbilical vein dilatation, resulting from hepatic congestion, could be used as a sign of impending fetal compromise. We analyzed data obtained from 47 patients in a total of 76 examinations, including sonographic measurement of umbilical vein diameter, associated ultrasound findings, results of amniotic fluid spectral analyses, and neonatal outcome. The collected data, divided in two groups according to the results of amniotic fluid spectral analyses (less than high zone II and greater than or equal to high zone II), showed that the sonographic measurement of umbilical vein diameter does not differ significantly between the two groups (p greater than 0.05). Therefore, the present and relatively large series demonstrates that dimensions of the umbilical vein cannot be used as a reliable predictor of worsening fetal disease.\r"

Peak-systolic/end-diastolic ratios were calculated according to previously described techniques. All measurements were made before tocolytic therapy was begun: magnesium sulfate (n = 40) or ritodrine (n = 20). The mean gestational age was 33.1 +/- 1.5 weeks (range 29 to 36 weeks). Twelve (20%) patients had elevated (greater than 2.6) pretherapy uterine peak-systolic/end-diastolic ratios, 10 (16.7%) patients had elevated (greater than 3.5) pretherapy umbilical peak-systolic/end-diastolic ratios, and in eight (13.3%) patients both ratios were elevated. In seven (58.4%) of the 12 patients with elevated uterine peak-systolic/end-diastolic ratios, six (60%) of the 10 patients with elevated umbilical peak-systolic/end-diastolic ratios, and five (62.5%) of the eight patients with both ratios elevated tocolytics failed and the women were delivered within 48 hours, compared with seven (14.6%) of 48, eight (16%) of 50, and six (13.0%) of 46 with normal ratios, respectively (p less than 0.05). We conclude that patients in preterm labor with elevated pretherapy uterine and/or umbilical peak-systolic/end-diastolic ratios are more likely to fail tocolysis therapy and be delivered preterm than those with normal ratios. It may therefore be useful to include umbilical and uterine velocimetry in the initial evaluation of preterm labor.\r"

Prostacyclin methyl ester at 1 and 10 micrograms/ml induced ovulation in the absence of gonadotropin, with ovulatory efficiencies of 26.7% +/- 3.8% and 46.5% +/- 5.0%, respectively. Most ovulated ova (77.4%) did not progress beyond the germinal vesicle stage, and there was no significant degeneration of ovulated ova or follicular oocytes. Examination of the follicular microvasculature 5 hours after exposure to prostacyclin revealed marked vessel dilatation and filling defects at the apex. By 7 hours after prostacyclin exposure, the intrafollicular space contained extravasated resin, reflecting increased vascular permeability. The vascular changes paralleled those previously observed in gonadotropin-induced ovulation. These results indicate that prostacyclin acting locally alters the vascular integrity of the follicle wall and facilitates follicle rupture.\r"

Arginine vasopressin is also considered an important stress hormone in the fetus. The effect of arginine vasopressin infusion on adrenocorticotropic hormone release in the fetus was investigated in 14 chronically cannulated ovine fetuses with normal blood gas and pH values between 103 and 137 days' gestation. There was a significant increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels during a 30-minute infusion of arginine vasopressin. Plasma renin activity was unchanged. The corticotropin-releasing activity of arginine vasopressin was not blocked by pretreatment with a V1-receptor antagonist and was not significantly different when the pressor response was attenuated by sodium nitroprusside infusion.\r"

This error in serologic testing occurred when false-negative results were obtained from the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay used to screen donor corneas for human immunodeficiency virus exposure. The average risk of transplanting an infected cornea was low, 0.03%, but increased by a factor of ten when donor tissue from donors at high risk for AIDS was used. Current screening procedures are probably adequate to prevent transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, but increased vigilance for high-risk donor populations may be appropriate.\r"

Intense staining by Dr hemagglutinin was shown in colonic, bronchial, and endometrial glands, and skin eccrine sweat glands.

HgCl2-induced changes in the composition of leukocyte populations and in the expression of MHC antigens in lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs were investigated by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. An early increase of CD4+ splenocytes was followed by a transient proliferation of CD4+ as well as CD8+ and B lymphocytes in peripheral lymphoid organs; in contrast, progressive depletion of the thymic cortex was found. B lymphocyte activation involved mainly the IgG1 and IgE isotypes. Nonlymphoid organs were infiltrated by MHC class II antigen expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and monocytes; secondary to infiltration, mainly epithelial cells, being the main target of infiltrating cells, showed increased expression of MHC antigens. In glomeruli a 2.7-fold increase of CD8+ lymphocytes occurred after HgCl2-administration. The diverse autoimmune phenomena observed in this study fit with the hypothesized involvement of T lymphocytes autoreactive with MHC class II antigens. Apart from anti-GBM autoantibodies, a role for autoreactive CD8+ T lymphocytes must be considered in the pathogenesis of the HgCl2-induced autoimmune syndrome.\r"

This joint inflammation subsides after 2 weeks but it could be reactivated by systemic injection of SCW in a dose-dependent way. The primary arthritis as well as the flare-up reaction were more vehement in immunized than naive mice. Pretreatment with antilymphocyte serum of nonimmunized arthritic mice before systemic challenge completely inhibits the flare-up reaction, suggesting the involvement of lymphocytes in the reactivation. Dose-response studies showed that intravenous challenge with SCW amounts too small to induce a primary arthritis were able to reactivate a chronic arthritis, implying that an inflamed joint is in a hyperreactive state, probably due to locally retained lymphocytes. Arthritis as a result of injection with SCW can be reactivated by fragments of a nonrelated, gram negative endogenous bacterium, Escherichia coli. The latter finding might be of importance for the understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic arthritis: once an arthritis is induced by one bacterium, other (unrelated) bacteria, probably derived from an endogenous source, may be able to reactivate the inflammatory process, thus contributing to chronicity.\r"

Both MAbs reacted selectively with carcinomas when a positive test was set at greater than or equal to 10% reactive tumor cells. However, MAb B72.3 reacted with significantly more of the carcinomas (86%, chi-square test, P less than 0.01) and bound to a greater percentage of tumor cells (47 +/- 28%; mean +/- SD, t-test, P less than 0.001) than Leu M1 (57% and 25 +/- 28%, respectively). The similar reactivities of surgically resected tumor specimens and post mortem tissues with both antibodies confirmed antigen stability and suggested broad clinical utility. PAS-D stained 61% of the carcinomas. Using the markers for carcinomas (PAS-D, B72.3, and Leu M1), the tumors were classified into the correct group in 80 of 82 (98%) cases (95% confidence level: greater than 92% accuracy).

The FRA within the mesangium of minimal or mild PGN was composed of the non-XLFb substance. The FRA within Bowman's space of most PGN had disappeared after MCA treatment, suggesting a non-XLFb substance.

The brains of all autopsies on AIDS patients performed at UCSD between 1982 and 1986 (N = 93) were studied. Neuropathologic changes consistent with a viral encephalitis were present in 54 brains (58%). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigens were detected in 37 of the brains (40%), most frequently in macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and endothelial cells. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was detected in 31 of the brains (33%), 22 of which also contained HIV. Cellular localization of CMV antigens suggests that CMV disseminates to the central nervous system hematogenously where the virus can infect endothelial cells, glia, and neurons. While the temporal course of the appearance of these two viruses within the CNS is not clear, the common simultaneous occurrence of both viruses within the brains of AIDS patients suggests that in vivo interaction between them may play a role in the pathogenesis of AIDS-associated encephalitis. Given the significant neurologic symptoms described in AIDS patients, the paucity of viral antigens suggests a pathogenic mechanism of indirect CNS damage rather than direct viral infection.\r"

Serial graft biopsies (pretransplant, time zero, and 1 week) were studied. Ten patients received azathioprine (AZA) and prednisone; the other six patients were treated with quadruple therapy (azathioprine, cyclosporine A, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide). To study the specificity of changes in MHC antigen expression, biopsies of six patients with minor or no morphologic abnormalities served as controls. In addition, phenotypes of inflammatory cells present during rejection were analyzed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The results show that during acute rejection expression of MHC Class I and II antigens increased significantly in the AZA-treated patients, in a pattern similar to that seen in the patients treated with quadruple therapy, showing enhanced MHC Class I expression on hepatocytes, bile duct epithelium, and sinusoidal endothelium, and Class II antigen on Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelium. Bile duct epithelium was consistently positive for Class II antigen; no significant difference with the nonrejection group was observed. T cells are the predominant inflammatory cells during rejection with equal quantities of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. A majority of the infiltrating T cells show expression of Class II antigen but do not react with anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibody. This may be the result of immunosuppressive therapy or a simple reflection of the temporary expression of interleukin-2 receptors during lymphocyte activation. The authors hypothesize that the induction of MHC antigens on bile duct epithelium leads to rejection whereas the expression on hepatocytes represents an epiphenomenon.\r"

The mean follow-up of the cohort was 7.4 years. The men were free of clinical heart disease at entry; men with an abnormal resting electrocardiogram or graded exercise test also were excluded.

The probes were also used to monitor the therapeutic response of 18 of the Rangers during 7 days of treatment. The probes proved highly specific. Both probes had lower limits of detection of about 100 parasites per microliter blood. Thus, the low parasite densities in partially immune villagers from an endemic area were often missed, while higher parasite densities in the nonimmune Rangers were usually detected. As monitors of response to treatment, the probes paralleled microscopy in identifying reversion from positive to negative parasitemia.

Three groups differing in the length of time they had resided in a malarious area were studied. The percentage of individuals in each group who had positive antibody responses to R32tet32 increased with increased exposure to malaria. However, antibody positivity was not correlated with in vitro lymphocyte proliferation responses to the antigen. Lymphocytes from 79% of the individuals showing serum antibodies to R32tet32 failed to respond in a lymphocyte transformation assay, suggesting that T cell helper activity in these individuals was based upon the recognition of a T cell epitope not located within this peptide.\r"
