Serial sections of the specimens were examined histologically (H & E) and immunohistologically (peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique) for immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and C1q and C3 complements. Active otosclerotic foci were found in 61 cases, 43 of which had IgG deposits. IgM antibodies were absent. In specimens with inactive otosclerosis, IgG and IgM were not evident, C1q and C3 complements were demonstrated together with IgG, but sometimes also in the mucosa independent of the phase of the otosclerosis. Our findings suggest that an immunologic process may be important in the pathogenesis of otosclerosis.\r"

It is concluded that aspartate aminotransferase activity appears to be especially concerned with cochlear energy metabolism, while glutaminase activity may function in transmitter metabolism in the guinea pig cochlea.

The distribution of elastic cartilage in the arytenoids was investigated histologically in two serial sections: horizontal and coronal. The behavior of the elastic cartilage portion of the arytenoids was investigated histologically under the conditions of adduction and abduction. The results are summarized as follows. 1) Elastic cartilage is found not only at the tip of the vocal process but at the superior portion of the arytenoid cartilage from the vocal process to the apex. 2) This phenomenon is observed at birth. 3) The vocal process bends at the elastic cartilage portion during adduction and abduction. The sides of the arytenoids come into contact mainly at the elastic cartilage portion. 4) Elastic cartilage appears to play an important role in the physiologic functioning of the arytenoid.\r"

A pilot study analyzing pulmonary function in 18 children successfully decannulated after laryngotracheal reconstruction was performed. The children ranged in age from 24 months to 12 years and were several months postdecannulation at the time of testing. The results of this pilot study offer an objective assessment of functional capacity after laryngotracheal reconstruction in older children and serve as a basis for objective follow-up. In younger children, pulmonary function values were difficult to obtain and proved to be of no significant value to the overall assessment of functional capacity of the airway.\r"

  ".W": "An excised canine larynx model of phonation was developed to assess the effect of vocal fold length and tension on glottographic waveforms. The canine larynx in an experimentally produced phonatory model vibrated in a two-mass system comparable to human voice production. The recorded glottographic waveforms for the excised canine larynx were similar to signals recorded in humans in the chest register. Vocal fold length, longitudinal vocal fold tension, glottic width, and airflow rate were varied while simultaneous measurements were made of the subglottic pressure, electroglottographic signal, photoglottographic signal, and acoustic signal. The model used is illustrated and discussed, with emphasis on the method of simulating the actions of all of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles, including the thyroarytenoid muscles. The open quotient and speed quotient, calculated from the glottographic signals, were dependent on vocal fold length and tension and glottic width. These results suggest that glottographic analysis, particularly speed quotient and open quotient, provide valuable information on vocal fold vibration during phonation, and may be important in assessing laryngoplasty procedures.\r"

The results of this comparison indicate that most otoscopically normal unfixed cadaver ears have middle ear input immittances that are indistinguishable from those of live subjects in the 0.1- to 2-kHz range--as long as they have been kept from drying and the static pressures on either side of the tympanic membrane are equal. The effects of the middle ear muscles on the measured input immittance are generally small and the cadaver ears can be maintained in the frozen state for several months with little change. Tympanometry appears to be a reliable indicator of normal middle ear immittance. Cadaver middle ears are useful models of human middle ear function.\r"

The median clearance was 0.87 ml/kg/min (range: 0.4-9.62) and median elimination half life 321 mins (64-1251). There were wide differences in the manner in which individual infants handled the drug and transient depression of blood pressure and heart rate was observed. These data were used to calculate an infusion dosage. In four infants 20 micrograms/kg alfentanil given by infusion over 30 minutes followed by 5 micrograms/kg/hour produced steady state median alfentanil concentrations of 54.5 ng/ml (range: 7-73 ng/ml) with no evidence of drug accumulation.\r"

A mean profile of the 20 babies permitted estimation of the periodicity of the pulsing: the cycle alternated every nine to 11 days.

The septicaemic infants were divided into three groups: the first comprised eight feverish infants, the second 11 with normal temperatures who were in relatively good clinical condition, and the third seven with normal temperatures who were in poor clinical condition. All 55 healthy babies had rectal temperatures of less than 37.8 degrees C and a mean rectal-sole temperature difference of 2.5 degrees C. The first group of septicaemic infants had rectal temperatures over 37.8 degrees C and a high mean temperature difference of 6.9 degrees C, whereas the second group had rectal temperatures less than 37.8 degrees C and a mean temperature difference of 4.7 degrees C. Infants of the third group had a low rectal temperature and a low mean temperature difference (1.1 degrees C). We conclude that septicaemic newborn infants show an adequate thermoregulatory reaction, which is reflected by a widening of the rectal-sole temperature difference of more than 3.5 degrees C, except for those who are critically ill, who lose this ability. In view of these results infants with normal temperatures but with a rectal-sole temperature difference of more than 3.5 degrees C should be suspected of septicaemia and investigated thoroughly.\r"

  ".W": "Beginning in the mid-1960s, the enrollment of African-Americans in the nation's colleges of medicine began to rise dramatically, but by 1975 it had leveled off, and it has since remained essentially unchanged at 6 to 7%. The University of Tennessee College of Medicine failed to increase its enrollment of black students during the period of dramatic growth, and it consistently ranked among the bottom one-fourth of U.S. medical schools in this respect until the fall of 1988. With the enrollment of 17 first-time, first-year African-American students for both the 1988-89 and 1989-90 academic years, the college now ranks in the top one-fourth of the nation's medical schools in this regard. This essay chronicles the events, discoveries made through self-analysis, new programs, changes in operating procedure, and institutional commitment that led eventually to this improvement. Based on a decade of experience, the authors recommend that UT Memphis and all other U.S. colleges of medicine become directly, but appropriately, involved in students' education far earlier than traditionally considered to be within their domain. If lasting and effective alliances can be established with institutions of primary, secondary, and undergraduate college education, it should be possible to escape from the persistent and perplexing problem of stagnation in the growth of black enrollment.\r"

Although there was widespread use of standardized patients throughout the curricula, the role and training of these patients varied markedly within a given school as well as across schools. One outcome of this survey is the development of a network to share resources, protocols, and training material to enhance the development of this educational strategy.\r"

  ".W": "Postsecondary accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation, including the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), are required to evaluate educational program effectiveness by determining that institutions and programs document the achievement of their students and graduates in verifiable and consistent ways, indicating that institutional and program purposes are met. For the assessment of medical education programs this represents a departure from the traditional method of inferring quality from institutional compliance with standards for program organization and function. In the new assessment calculus, success is measured as the integrated product of the outcomes, the indicators of achievement that medical schools already are collecting from many sources, for instance, data on premedical achievement and attributes, medical school performance, graduate education ratings and test results, specialty certification, licensure, and practice. Although a recent LCME enquiry showed that 80% of U.S. medical schools were collecting outcome data on students and graduates, there was a lack of coherence and system, little integrated analysis, rare longitudinal study, and limited use of the information to evaluate and revise the curriculum or to validate admissions, promotion, and graduation criteria. The longitudinal study of the quantified results of educational programs need not resurrect old controversies about the linkage between learning in medical school and the quality of doctors' later practice. The purpose of examining outcomes is to gain sharper focus on the achievement of distinctive institutional goals, to facilitate program improvement and renewal, and to better assure the competence of graduates within the boundaries of achievement that schools have drawn as their educational objectives.\r"

  ".U": "90248051\r", 
  ".W": "Emphasis on controlling health-care costs has led to many activities aimed at avoiding medically unnecessary hospitalizations. Much less attention has been given to patients hospitalized in advanced stages of illness and the impact of these late admissions on cost and quality of care. A panel of physicians developed criteria to categorize hospital admissions into one of three groups--early, timely, or late--based on the timing of the initial hospitalizations of patients admitted with any one of 14 diagnoses. Over a period of one year (fiscal year 1984) the criteria were applied retrospectively to 2,713 patients admitted to either of two hospitals. Twenty-one percent of the admissions studied in one hospital and 19% in the other were judged to occur later than was desirable. The mean length of stay for late hospitalizations exceeded that for timely hospitalizations by 11.1 days at one hospital and by 7.5 days at the other (p less than .01). Similar patterns were observed in analyzing the 14 diseases individually and in an analysis of hospital charges at the one hospital where charge data were available. In-hospital mortality rates for patients with a principal diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia were over ten times greater for those admitted late than for those whose admissions were timely (39.0% versus 3.8%, p less than .001, at one hospital; 28.9% versus 2.1%, p less than .001, at the other). While not all late hospitalizations are avoidable, the authors believe that the analysis of late hospitalization patterns is an important part of any effort that can be made to reduce them.\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes a collaborative effort among five New England medical schools to assess important clinical skills of fourth-year medical students graduating in the class of 1988; results are presented from the four schools that provided sufficient data. Faculty from each school developed 36 patient cases representing a variety of common ambulatory-care problems. Over the course of a day, each student, on average, interacted with 16 different standardized patients, who were nonphysicians trained to accurately and consistently portray a patient in a simulated clinical setting. The students obtained focused histories, performed relevant physical examinations, and provided the patients with education and counseling. At each school, the performance of a small number of the students fell below standards set by the faculty. These deficiencies were not detected with the evaluation strategies currently being used. Although the use of standardized patients should not substitute for the process of faculty observing students as they interact with real patients, it appears that standardized patients can provide faculty with important information, not readily available from other sources, about students' performances of essential clinical activities and the levels of their clinical skills.\r"

The authors conducted the present study in 1987 to determine whether either was superior for clinical data integration. Sophomore medical students at The University of Texas Medical School at San Antonio indicated whether they preferred the POMR, the CD, or neither. They were then divided into three study groups according to their preferences, with the POMR and CD groups receiving 80 hours of training and the control group receiving only the standard preclinical training. Each student then examined a standardized patient and wrote an open-ended report about the patient's medical problem. After examining a second patient, students were asked to write a structured report providing information about each of ten components of diagnosis. Both the CD and the POMR groups scored numerically higher on the structured type of report than did the controls, but only the CD group scored significantly higher. The CD group also scored higher than did the POMR group on both types of report, but the differences were not statistically significant. This study indicates that the clinical reasoning of medical students can be enhanced by focused training in either the CD or the POMR methods. It suggests that the CD format may be particularly helpful for students with lower academic achievement.\r"

The authors report their findings concerning the overall process used by these schools to evaluate medicine clerks, specifically identifying the importance given to subjective evaluations, made by attending physicians and/or housestaff, compared with the importance given to clerks' performances on objective means of evaluation based on written and/or oral examinations, whether national or faculty-developed. The study reveals that the subjective evaluations of clerks by faculty attending physicians and by housestaff working with the clerks were used by 98 and 83 of the responding schools, respectively, and were given the greatest evaluative weight. Examinations of all types were used by 87 of the responding schools. The National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Part II Medicine Examination was the most frequently used and heavily weighted examination, followed by written faculty examinations. Oral examinations were the least frequently used evaluative tools, carried the least weight, and were rarely used without another examination. In light of their findings, the authors maintain that further research should be done to clarify whether the NBME Part II Medicine Examination is an appropriate instrument to measure the knowledge acquired during clerkship experiences.\r"

When the only medical school in Malta faced this situation, it agreed to try a new model for training potential faculty. This model was an intensive eight-month course for a selected group of ten experienced Maltese general practitioners to train in Malta with a visiting professor of family medicine. These adult learners were heavily involved in designing and contributing to an intensive course in family medicine and in teaching. Maltese teaching resources were used, and training occurred in the context of the society and health care system in which course members would ultimately teach. Subjective and objective measurements of course achievement were made. Results were compared with certification standards of the Canadian College of Family Physicians. This model merits consideration by other medical schools that wish to start academic programs in family medicine.\r"

The size of the left ventricular cavity was increased in all with a mean (SD) transverse diameter of 7.2 (0.8) cm at end diastole and 6.3 (0.8) cm at end systole. All were in sinus rhythm and 35 had functional mitral regurgitation. In nine patients, in whom filling period was less than 170 ms, transmitral flow showed only a single peak, representing summation. In the remainder there was a strikingly bimodal distribution of filling pattern. In 12 the ventricle filled dominantly with atrial systole (A fillers). Isovolumic relaxation was long (75 (35) ms) and wall motion incoordinate; mitral regurgitation was present in only one. In most (29) the left ventricle filled predominantly during early diastole (E fillers). Mitral regurgitation, which was present in 26, was much more common than in the A fillers, while the isovolumic relaxation time (10 (24) ms) was much shorter and the normal phase relations between flow velocity and wall motion were lost. In 24 E fillers no atrial flow was detected. In four there was no evidence of any mechanical activity, suggesting \"atrial failure\". In 20, either the apex cardiogram or the mitral echogram showed an A wave, implying that atrial contraction had occurred but had failed to cause transmitral flow, showing that ventricular filling was fundamentally disturbed in late diastole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the controls long axis shortening significantly preceded minor axis shortening (mean (1 SD) difference 25 (40) ms) so that the minor axis increased more during isovolumic contraction (0.25 v 0.09 cm), indicating that the left ventricle became more spherical. Changes in the long and short axes were synchronous at end ejection and in early diastole in the controls. Epicardial excursion preceded endocardial excursion by 50 (20) ms at its peak. These time relations were consistently disturbed in all patient groups, irrespective of the extent of fractional shortening of the minor axis. The onset of long axis shortening was delayed, and this was often associated with premature shortening of the minor axis, the normal spherical shape change during isovolumic contraction was lost, and peak epicardial and endocardial changes became more synchronous. In patients with coronary disease these changes are the expected consequence of ischaemic injury to longitudinally orientated subendocardial fibres. In left ventricular hypertrophy their presence consistently showed systolic dysfunction when orthodox measures were still normal. They were more pronounced after mitral valve replacement when the papillary muscles had been sectioned; long axis shortening was reduced during systole and prolonged into early diastole, while normal shortening of the minor axis was maintained only by abnormal epicardial excursion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Paroxysms occurred more often by day than by night, suggesting that attacks are more closely associated with sympathetic than with vagal activity. In 41 patients who were not taking digoxin there were 79 episodes, and in 31 patients who were taking digoxin there were 60 episodes. Significantly more of the episodes that lasted for 30 minutes or more occurred in patients taking digoxin (13/17); the relative risk of a prolonged paroxysm associated with taking digoxin was 4.3 (95% confidence intervals 1.6-11.9). The mean (SD) ventricular rate at the onset of the paroxysms was not significantly different in those taking digoxin (140 (25) beats/min) and in those who were not (134 (22) beats/min). In paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, pretreatment with digoxin does not seem to reduce the frequency of paroxysms, or the ventricular rate when paroxysms occur, but it is associated with longer attacks.\r"

Sequential measurements showed that the valve area initially increased from a mean (SD) of 0.52 (0.16) to 0.78 (0.17) cm2. It was 0.73 (0.16) cm2 five minutes after dilatation and this was little changed at four weeks (0.70 (0.15) cm2). Initially the mean transvalvar gradient fell significantly from 54 (27) to 32 (8) mm Hg but increased to 35 (10) mm Hg at five minutes and to 40 (11) mm Hg at four weeks. In six valves stretching of the orifice was the only mechanism responsible for the changes while in the remainder there was tearing through commissures with a greater initial increase in area (0.31 v 0.18 cm2) and a smaller decrease in area at five minutes (0.03 v 0.08 cm2). Fractures of calcific deposits in non-commissural positions were seen in one valve only. This laboratory study of isolated aortic valves showed a significant but small increase in valve area after balloon dilatation, which was greater when commissural tearing had occurred. Recoil of the stretched orifice was complete at five minutes and there was little further change over the next four weeks.\r"

  ".W": "The monorail technique allows monitoring of all steps of the coronary angioplasty procedure by high quality coronary angiography; easy, rapid, and safe recrossing and redilatation of the lesion if necessary; and stepwise dilatation of a stenosis with sequential increase of size of balloons. Transstenotic pressure differences cannot, however, be measured through the narrow shaft of the standard monorail balloon catheter. The monorail technique was used in 1014 patients (820 men, 194 women; mean age 57.8 years (range 24 to 84]. The indication for coronary angioplasty was stable angina in 52%, unstable angina in 40%, and acute myocardial infarction in 8%. Single vessel coronary angioplasty was attempted in 78%, multilesion coronary angioplasty in 11%, and multivessel coronary angioplasty in 11%. Angiographic success (reduction of stenosis to less than 50% of the luminal diameter) of all attempted lesions was achieved in 93%. The technique was clinically successful--that is, angiographic success of all attempted lesions, no occurrence of a major complication (death, myocardial infarction, acute bypass surgery), and improvement of symptoms--in 92% and partially successful in 1.3%. The clinical success rates were similar for stable angina (91%) and unstable angina (94%), but were somewhat lower for acute myocardial infarction (88%). Failure without major complication occurred in 3.4% of the patients. Failure with a major complication occurred in 3.3% (death 0.3%, myocardial infarction 2.4%, and acute bypass surgery 2.3%). The total major complication rate was higher in unstable angina (4.2%) than in stable angina (3.0%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All three immunohistochemical markers showed pronounced changes in the lesional skin with a clear transition to the uninvolved skin. The suprabasal Ks8.12 binding was the earliest change found in the epidermis, and its localization high in the suprabasal compartment indicates that metabolic dysregulation in this cell population was not a consequence of the recruitment process in the basal layer.\r"

The mast-cell activation was associated with loss of membrane integrity and inhibited by the hydrogen peroxide scavenger, catalase. Histamine release was independent of extracellular calcium in the rodent mast cells, but was markedly reduced in the absence of calcium in human cells. These findings indicate that PP and UVA induce mast-cell-mediator release by a process that may involve hydrogen peroxide formation. There appear to be differences in response to PP and UVA between rodent and human mast cells.\r"

The biomechanical skin parameters investigated were elasticity, extensibility and hysteresis and data were normalized for skin thickness. A slight but non-significant increase of skin elasticity was detected in the tretinoin-treated sites using low-stressing forces (1.2 X 10(4) Nm-2) and at higher loads (3.8 X 10(4) Nm-2), the increase in skin elasticity was significant (P less than 0.01). This improved skin elasticity was dependent on the increased collagen resulting from topical tretinoin and the replacement of elastotic material. However, topical tretinoin treatment did not improve the responses mediated by elastic fibres.\r"

Tretinoin has been shown to be effective in the improvement of these visible signs. The adverse effects of tretinoin present in the early phase of treatment: with adequate counselling from the dermatologist, and patience and preseverence on the part of the patient, these effects are only temporary and disappear with prolonged treatment. It seems that the longer the treatment and the stronger the concentration of tretinoin, the better the result.\r"

  ".W": "Ageing is associated with impairment of immune function, the most significant changes being a decrease in T-cell-mediated immunity and antibody-mediated effector functions, and an increase in autoantibodies and other dysregulatory phenomena, such as an abnormal production of monoclonal antibodies and other immune complexes. Elderly subjects are increasingly susceptible to cutaneous pathological changes that are known to correlate with immune deficiencies, such as viral and fungal infections, and skin cancers. Antigenic responses in skin may be an indicator of immune status. The recall antigens elicit fewer delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in the elderly, particularly in subjects over 75 years old. Sensitivity to contact allergens, such as dinitrochlorobenzene, and inflammatory responses and the cutaneous response to histamine are reduced in the elderly. The pathophysiology of deficiencies in the skin's immune system in the elderly is not clear; it probably reflects not only a general decline in the immune system but also more specific changes. Age-related changes in epidermal immune functions have been observed, such as morphological and functional changes in Langerhans cells and decreased production of various cytokines. Evaluation of these changes is difficult and the results may be disputed, but it is probable that sun-induced ageing plays an important role. Few substances seem to be capable of stimulating the immunoactive cells of the skin or of modifying the production of epidermal cytokines. One possibility may be vitamin A and its derivatives, and studies of other molecules such as interferons are being carried out.\r"

In five of the seven patients the retina became reattached within three days and remained reattached with follow-up periods of three to 22 months (average nine months).

The other group (non-retrobulbar) had superior bulbar, subconjunctival infiltration with bupivicaine and hyaluronidase. The operative complications and postoperative visual outcomes were similar in both groups.

The purpose of the study was to establish the feasibility of this type of anaesthesia in cataract surgery with the principal object of avoiding the possibility of retrobulbar haemorrhage and the other, rarer, complications of retrobulbar injection. The method, which is referred to as the NR method, proved to be satisfactory. No undue difficulties were encountered as a result of using the technique, the visual results were satisfactory and compared favourably with those under general anaesthesia, and the patients accepted the method well, possibly preferring it to conventional methods.\r"

We analysed a group of 30 patients with indirect choroidal ruptures with specific reference to the circumstances of the injury, the pattern of ocular damage, the cause of any visual loss, and the final visual outcome. Using this analysis we deduce a pathogenetic explanation for the characteristic fundus signs in patients with indirect choroidal ruptures. The majority of cases were young males injured during sport or by an assault, a minority were injured at work. Diffuse nonfocal impact injuries due to punches were associated with ruptures concentric with and adjacent to the optic disc. Focal impact injuries, due to projectiles, showed more extensive ocular damage. Seventeen of 30 patients regained 6/12 vision after injury. Injuries due to projectiles and temporally situated ruptures were associated with a poorer visual outcome than others. Macular damage was the commonest cause of visual loss, principally due to pigmentary maculopathy, traumatic inner retinal damage, and choroidal neovascular membranes rather than direct focal damage by the rupture.\r"

The predictive power of a positive result (PP+) depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the screener in the population in which it is to be used. Using data from 755 normal individuals (1510 eyes), we calculated the PP+ of the Henson CFS2000 screening programme for a population aged 50 and over. 4.3% of normal eyes failed the screening programme. Ignoring one or two misses on the screening programme immediately adjacent to the disc reduced this figure to 1.3% and significantly improved the PP+ of the programme. Calculations of the PP+ at increasing glaucoma prevalence levels indicates this to be particularly relevant at low levels such as those encountered when screening middle aged and elderly populations. Optometrists should perform routine field analysis when screening for glaucoma provided they adhere to strict protocols.\r"

Secondary glaucoma was present in 23 patients (31 eyes): three of 24 patients with acute uveitis (three eyes, 12% of acute uveitis patients) and 20 of 76 patients with chronic uveitis (28 eyes, 26% of chronic uveitis patients). Eighteen patients (26 eyes, 78% of glaucoma patients) with chronic uveitis required long-term medical therapy to control intraocular pressure. Three patients (three eyes, 12% of glaucoma patients) with acute uveitis required short-term therapy to control intraocular pressure. The remaining two patients had transient increases in intraocular pressure that did not require treatment or that responded to treatment of intraocular inflammation alone. One patient with chronic uveitis (two eyes, 4% of glaucoma patients) required filtering surgery. At least five patients (eight eyes, 22% of glaucoma patients) had glaucomatous visual field defects. The results of this survey are consistent with the concept that secondary glaucoma is a management problem in patients with anterior segment inflammation and chronic rather than acute uveitis. An algorithm for the management of increased intraocular pressure in patients with uveitis is proposed.\r"

In each case, ultrastructural analyses showed viruses within megakaryocytes and platelets. In murine specimens, the uptake of retrovirus was avid at all stages of differentiation. In human specimens, viral uptake was less frequent. These results suggest that direct infection of megakaryocytes could play a role in the pathophysiology of HIV-associated disease.

Our results show that rsCD23 in synergy with rIL-1 displays an interleukin-3-like activity as it promotes the proliferation of multipotential marrow precursors. This effect was abolished by anti-CD23 addition to these cultures, but was not affected by anti-IL-3 monoclonal antibody.

Western blot analysis and flow cytometric analysis of four murine cell lines with known ALDH levels were used to establish the relation between ALDH content and fluorescence with an affinity-purified anti-mouse ALDH antibody. An affinity purified anti-human ALDH antibody, characterized by immunoblotting of cytosolic extracts of cell lines with known ALDH content, was used to determine relative ALDH levels in the marrow subpopulations. We found that hematopoietic progenitor cells express the highest level of ALDH, while lymphocytes express the lowest level.

  ".U": "90248568\r", 
  ".W": "We have re-evaluated the previously reported ability of TLCK-thrombin (N alpha-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone-treated alpha-thrombin) and PPACK-thrombin (D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone-treated alpha-thrombin) to inhibit alpha-thrombin-induced platelet activation (Harmon JT, Jamieson GA: J Biol Chem 261:15928, 1986; and Harmon JT, Jamieson GA: Biochemistry 27:2151, 1988). Despite several cycles of derivatization with TLCK (10,000-fold molar excess), preparations of TLCK-thrombin have been found to contain about 4% residual alpha-thrombin activity, suggesting that these preparations are an equilibrium mixture of TLCK-thrombin and alpha-thrombin and cannot be used for evaluating competition between these two agents. In contrast, alpha-thrombin activity was completely inhibited by PPACK at 15-fold molar excess. PPACK-thrombin, free of unreacted PPACK and devoid of residual alpha-thrombin activity, did not markedly affect platelet shape change at concentrations as high as 1 mumol/L, but inhibited aggregation and secretion in intact platelets activated with the minimal concentration of alpha-thrombin causing a full response (0.3 to 0.5 nmol/L) and yielded a 50% inhibition constant (IC50) for inhibition of aggregation by PPACK-thrombin of 110 nmol/L. This inhibition was specific for alpha-thrombin-induced platelet activation, and no inhibition was seen with activation induced by ADP, collagen, epinephrine, ristocetin, or arachidonate. At these low alpha-thrombin concentrations (approximately 0.4 nmol/L), a persistent cytoplasmic acidification was observed of -0.062 +/- 0.016 pH units, although alkalinization was observed at higher alpha-thrombin concentrations (greater than 1 nmol/L). While inhibition of aggregation and secretion occurred when alpha-thrombin and PPACK-thrombin were added simultaneously, inhibition of cytoplasmic acidification and of the elevation of cytoplasmic [Ca2+] induced by low concentrations of alpha-thrombin (0.4 nmol/L) occurred only if platelets were preincubated with PPACK-thrombin for 5 minutes before the addition of alpha-thrombin. In platelets treated with Serratia marcescens protease to remove glycoprotein lb (GPlb), alpha-thrombin-induced shape change was attenuated but persisted in the presence of a high concentration (2 mumol/L) of PPACK-thrombin, although aggregation and secretion were inhibited, as seen in intact platelets. The IC50 value for inhibition of aggregation by PPACK-thrombin was approximately 1 mumol/L at the higher alpha-thrombin concentrations (5 nmol/L) required for full activation in this case. These results suggest that PPACK-thrombin may be a useful probe of platelet function since it specifically blocks platelet aggregation and secretion induced by alpha-thrombin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Transplantation of immunocompetent cells present within allogeneic bone marrow has been associated with the elimination of residual host leukemia, both in animal tumor models and in patients receiving marrow transplants for leukemia. This observation has been called the \"graft-versus-leukemia effect.\" We have attempted to study this phenomenon in vitro by characterizing the cytolytic response of T cells from normal donors after in vitro activation with allogeneic leukemic cells. As expected, most T cells that react against an allogeneic patient's leukemic cells recognize their foreign HLA antigens and lyse the patient's nonleukemic remission lymphoid cells. In addition, we have shown that a small fraction of the T cells recognize and lyse foreign leukemic targets without lysis of nonmalignant remission targets from the same leukemic patient. These T cells have been isolated and characterized as CD3+, CD4+ cells expressing the alpha/beta T cell receptor (TCR). Their lysis appears to reflect specific antigen recognition mediated via the CD3-TCR complex and interactions involving the CD4 receptor. Some of these \"leukemic specific\" T cell lines, which are restricted by HLA class II molecules, can also lyse occasional nonleukemic cells from certain unrelated donors. This recognition appears to involve crossreactive determinants shared by the leukemic cells and the unrelated allogeneic nonleukemic cells. These specific interactions may represent an in vitro model of the graft-versus-leukemia effect.\r"

This raises the question of what separation, if any, there might be between their biologic activities. Receptor binding assays and cross-competition studies in three Epstein Barr virus (EBV) positive cell lines showed that a subset of IL-1 receptors may bind IL-1 alpha preferentially and that a separate subset may bind IL-1 beta preferentially. Crosslinking studies with 125I-IL-1 alpha or 125I-IL-1 beta demonstrated the expression of both relative molecular mass (Mr) 80,500 IL-1 receptor, known to be T cell-specific, and Mr 69,500 IL-1 receptor, recently detected on B-cell lineage only. Whether the high affinity binding sites correspond to Mr 80,500 and the low affinity binding sites to Mr 69,500 remains to be elucidated.\r"

The proteins are 51% homologous in their primary structure, cause necrosis of Meth A sarcoma in vivo, are toxic to selected tumor cells in vitro, and bind to the same receptor on cells in vitro. However, some recent studies have indicated both qualitative and quantitative differences between recombinant human (rh) LT and rhTNF with respect to inducing human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HEC) adhesiveness for neutrophils and release of hematopoietic growth factor and interleukin-1 (IL-1) from HEC. The rhLT used in these studies was expressed in bacteria and was consequently not glycosylated, whereas natural LT is glycosylated. Therefore, we have compared various preparations of glycosylated and nonglycosylated rhLT with two preparations of rhTNF with respect to their proinflammatory characteristics. We now report that the same LT cDNA, when expressed in mammalian cell line and appropriately glycosylated, is also markedly less potent than rhTNF on a molar basis in inducing endothelial adhesiveness for neutrophils and in directly activating neutrophil adherence to albumin-coated plastic. All recombinant proteins, however, were equipotent on a molar basis in producing cytotoxicity in L929 cells. We conclude that differences in the primary structure of rhTNF and rhLT, rather than alterations induced by prokaryote protein processing, account for the disparate proinflammatory activity in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Strong evidence implicates fusion of control elements and 5' sequences of the bcr gene of chromosome 22 with 3' sequences of the c-abl gene of chromosome 9 in the pathogenesis of Ph-positive and certain cases of Ph-negative chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Since this fusion gene gives rise to a chimeric tyrosine protein kinase with transforming potential, and since the bcr exon contribution to this chimeric protein is variable, the question has arisen as to whether bcr breakpoint location and bcr exon contribution could influence the clinical course of CML. Prior studies have yielded conflicting results on this point. Here we have looked, in a manner approximating a prospective analysis, at the relation of bcr breakpoint localization to the duration of chronic phase, total survival, and blast crisis phenotype in 81 patients presenting in the chronic phase of CML. We have found no significant differences in chronic phase duration or total survival among patients with breakpoints in the three major subregions of a breakpoint cluster region within the bcr gene. These findings indicate that chronic phase duration and total survival cannot be predicted from bcr breakpoint for CML patients presenting in chronic phase and suggest that unknown oncogenic events determining the onset of blast crisis are the prime determinants of prognosis. Combined analysis of blast crisis cell lineage in our patients and patients presented in a previous study has revealed an overall ratio of myeloid:lymphoid (M:L) crisis of 3.4:1, but a striking predominance of myeloid crisis in patients with breakpoints in subregion 2 (M:L of 9:1), and a lower than expected M:L ratio (1.6:1) among patients with breakpoints in subregion 3 (P for subregion 2 versus 3 = .012; subregions 0,1,2 versus 3 = .012; subregions 0,1,3 versus 2 = .032). The molecular basis for this divergence from the anticipated M:L ratio in patients with breakpoints in bcr subregions 2 and 3 is unknown.\r"

  ".U": "90248578\r", 
  ".W": "Changes in the light transmission of suspensions of activated neutrophils are widely used to measure the dynamics of neutrophil aggregation. Such studies have suggested, for example, that aggregation is irreversible for human newborn neutrophils but fully reversible for adult cells. We have evaluated aggregation directly by microscopic particle counting and compared it with changes in light transmission (delta T) and with release from three granule subsets for neutrophils activated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). Maximal increases in %T in response to 0.5 micromol/L FMLP were approximately 25% larger for newborn than for adult neutrophils, and were only partially reversible by 8 minutes, while %T increases for adult neutrophils were fully reversible. However, measurements of neutrophil aggregation using light microscopy showed that both newborn and adult neutrophils fully deaggregated. A further independence of delta T from aggregation was found by pretreating adult neutrophils with cytochalasin B (5 micrograms/mL) in the presence of 0.5% gelatin, a pretreatment that blocked FMLP-induced neutrophil aggregation while allowing large increases in %T and degranulation. In response to FMLP, newborn neutrophils released more enzyme from each granule subset than did adult neutrophils. Our results suggest that cellular events associated with neutrophil activation (other than aggregation) are implicated in light transmission responses and that these differ for adults and newborns. These results also suggest that reports of neutrophil aggregation should be based on direct particle counting methods rather than on %T responses.\r"

  ".U": "90248579\r", 
  ".W": "Partial digestion of spectrin dimers in vitro has allowed the definition of domains. For example, the portions of the dimers that are involved in spectrin self-association are represented by the alpha I and the beta I domains. The alpha I domain (80 Kd) is further cleaved into a minor 78 Kd fragment and, more substantially, into a 74 Kd fragment. The intensity of the latter, which we expressed as the 74:(80 + 78 + 74) ratio, or the 74:alpha I ratio, is variable depending on the experimental conditions, eg, in fine, on the conformation of the alpha I domain. A number of cases of hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) are associated with an increase of the 74:alpha I ratio, also referred to as the Sp alpha I/74 abnormality. Several lines of evidence have suggested that the causal mutations may lie in the alpha- or the beta-chain, a point of importance before one undertakes studies at the gene level. In order to address this question, we reconstituted spectrin dimers in vitro, combining alpha- and beta-chains of various origins, and then carried out partial digestion and assayed the Sp alpha I/74 abnormality. The patterns obtained with reconstituted dimers were nearly identical to those of native dimers. We applied the assay to three spectrin variants that cause Sp alpha I/74 HE: (1) a variant that we previously designated spectrin Nice and whose beta-chain lacks a 4 Kd fragment in its C-terminal region; and two distinct variants that we found in two unrelated white families and that we provisionally designated spectrin Lyon and spectrin Culoz. The Sp alpha I/74 abnormality appeared in all kinds of dimers that harbored the beta-chain of spectrin Nice, or the alpha-chain of spectrin Lyon or spectrin Culoz, respectively. Therefore, we confirmed that spectrin Nice is a (alpha I/74) beta-variant, and established that both spectrin Lyon and spectrin Culoz are (alpha I/74) alpha-variants. The present assay may be extended to any spectrin variant displaying the Sp alpha I/74 abnormality.\r"

We also examined their effect on oxygen affinity, surface hydrophobicity, mechanical stability, and solubility of HbF. Differences in G gamma:A gamma ratio did not affect the polymerization of mixtures of HbF and HbS, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of HbF on the polymerization of HbS is independent of the G gamma:A gamma ratio of HbF and is totally dependent on the fraction of HbF in the mixture. The oxygen equilibrium curve of HbF was not affected by differences in the ratios of G gamma and A gamma in HbF. In contrast, surface hydrophobicity, mechanical stability, and solubility of HbF were affected by differences in the G gamma:A gamma ratio. The higher the G gamma:A gamma ratio, the smaller the elution volume on a TSK Gel SW hydrophobic column in high phosphate buffer. The mechanical stability of HbF was also dependent on the ratio of G gamma:A gamma; stability was greater at higher fractions of A gamma. Differences in the G gamma:A gamma ratio also affected solubility of HbF: HbF containing the higher fraction of G gamma was the more soluble. These data indicate that although alanine at the 136th position of the gamma chains has a stronger surface hydrophobicity than does glycine, this difference does not affect either the polymerization of HbS or the oxygen affinity of HbF.\r"

  ".W": "Patients who undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are clinically immunodeficient for a prolonged period after engraftment. In the present study, we examined immune function after BMT in a series of patients who had received HLA compatible sibling marrow grafts purged of T cells with anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody and complement. None of the patients in this analysis received immunomodulating agents and none had developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Initially after BMT, natural killer (NK) cells are the predominant cell type, giving way to CD3+, CD5+ T cells after 4 to 8 weeks. Despite the return of normal numbers of T lymphocytes post-BMT phenotypic analysis reveals several long-term abnormalities, including an inverted T4:T8 ratio and a significant fraction of CD3+ T cells that do not co-express CD6. In mitogenic assays, stimulation by either nonspecific lectin (phytohemagglutinin; PHA) or antibodies to the CD2 surface structure (anti-T11(2) + anti-T11(3)) results in decreased levels of T-cell proliferation compared with controls for over 18 months post-BMT. In contrast, the ability of unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to respond to recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) is relatively intact, most likely reflecting early functional reconstitution of the NK cell population. To further characterize the prolonged abnormalities in T-cell proliferation after PHA or CD2 stimulation, we examined more proximal events in T-cell activation such as induction of IL-2 receptor expression and stimulus-induced intracellular calcium flux. We found that the induction of IL-2 receptor (p55) after in vitro activation, although initially abnormal, recovers completely by 6 months post-BMT. We also found that, after CD2 stimulation, calcium flux in T cells was normal immediately after engraftment. In contrast, after stimulation with anti-CD3 antibodies, a large population of T cells do not develop intracellular calcium flux compared with controls. We conclude that despite the recovery of normal numbers of T lymphocytes early after engraftment of CD6-depleted marrow, these T cells exhibit several physiologic and functional abnormalities that persist for varying intervals post-BMT. At present, it is unclear which of these specific defects is most closely associated with increased susceptibility to infectious agents after BMT.\r"

Western analysis using an hADA-specific antibody allowed detection of the protein in the peripheral blood of all 37 transplanted mice for at least 9 weeks. Sixty-eight percent of the animals continued to express hADA in one or more of their hematopoietic tissues for the experimental period, and hADA was found in both spleen colonies and tissues of secondary recipients. There was provirus integration and expression in myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid cell lineages, indicating extensive repopulation by the progeny of infected stem cells. The vector did not contain a selectable marker, and the infected stem cells did not have a competitive in vivo advantage. Nevertheless, we observed consistent gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells and long-term expression of a human gene product in their progeny.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare the outcome of pregnancy in women with and without renal scarring after childhood urinary infections with that in unmatched controls. DESIGN--Retrospective study of pregnancies in women prospectively followed up from their first recognised urinary infection. SETTING--Tertiary referral centre in Gothenburg. SUBJECTS--111 Women attending an outpatient clinic for women with urinary infection during 1975-83, of whom 41 (65 pregnancies) were studied (19 women with renal scarring (32), 22 without scarring (33)), and 65 controls (65) randomly selected and matched for parity, age, smoking habits, and date of delivery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Urinary infections and complications in pregnancy. RESULTS--The incidence of bacteriuria during first pregnancies was significantly greater in women with (9, 47%) and without (6, 27%) renal scarring after childhood urinary infection than in controls (1, 2%) (p less than 0.001, 0.01 respectively). Symptomatic infections were seen only among women with a history of urinary infection: four women with renal scarring (three of whom had vesicoureteric reflux) developed pyelonephritis and three cystitis, and one woman without scarring developed pyelonephritis. Mean blood pressure was higher among women with severe renal scarring than controls (4/11 v 3/44; p less than 0.05) before and during pregnancy. There was no significant difference in the incidence of pre-eclampsia, operative delivery, prematurity, or birth weight. CONCLUSIONS--Women with a history of previous urinary infections had a high incidence of bacteriuria during pregnancy, and those with renal scarring and persistent reflux were prone to develop acute pyelonephritis. The risk of serious complications in pregnancy, however, was not increased in women with severe renal scarring, possibly owing to their continuous clinical supervision.\r"

  ".W": "Recent government plans include the concept of a core of doctors of intermediate grade providing 24 hour emergency cover in hospital departments. Hinchingbrooke Hospital has, since its opening in 1983, been run on a two tier basis, with consultants and a part time senior registrar supported only by senior house officers in their first post, usually on general practice vocational training schemes. With a planned rate of around 2000 deliveries per year all high risk obstetric and neonatal paediatric procedures, including ventilation of very small babies, have been carried out within the hospital. A study of the first five complete years of operation of the obstetric and paediatric departments showed that the perinatal mortality rate was low (hospital rate 4.7/1000 in 9149 deliveries during 1984-8 v district rate 5.1/1000 during 1986-8), and patient satisfaction seemed to be high. In a separate prospective study of out of hours work performed by consultants in paediatrics (four weeks) and obstetrics (20 days) three consultants in paediatrics spent 71 hours working out of hours; for the obstetricians, of the 56 request for advice and 38 interventions, only five and six respectively occurred between midnight and 9 am. Although successful at this hospital, the two tier system would be expensive under the Royal College of Obstetricians' guidelines of one consultant to a maximum of 500 deliveries. An equal mixture of two tier and three tier systems might be the best solution for patient care and training of junior doctors.\r"

DESIGN--Longitudinal study of a cohort of children with annual measurements during an average follow up period of seven years. SETTING--Epidemiological survey of the population of a suburban town in western Netherlands. SUBJECTS--Cohort of 233 children aged 5-17 drawn at random from participants in the population survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--At least six annual timed overnight urine samples were obtained. The mean 24 hour sodium and potassium excretion during the follow up period was estimated for each participant and the sodium to potassium ratio calculated. Individual slopes of blood pressure over time were calculated by linear regression analysis. RESULTS--No significant association was observed between sodium excretion and the change in blood pressure over time. The mean systolic blood pressure slopes, however, were lower when potassium intake was higher (coefficient of linear regression -0.045 mm Hg/year/mmol; 95% confidence interval -0.069 to -0.020), and the change in systolic pressure was greater when the urinary sodium to potassium ratio was higher (0.356 mm Hg/year/unit; 95% confidence interval 0.069 to 0.642). In relation to potassium this was interpreted as a rise in blood pressure that was on average 1.0 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -1.65 to -0.35) lower in children in the upper part of the distribution of intake compared with those in the lower part. The mean yearly rise in systolic blood pressure for the group as a whole was 1.95 mm Hg. Urinary electrolyte excretion was not associated with diastolic blood pressure. CONCLUSION--Dietary potassium and the dietary sodium to potassium ratio are related to the rise in blood pressure in childhood and may be important in the early pathogenesis of primary hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reduces proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy more than blood pressure reduction with other antihypertensive treatment. DESIGN--Prospective, open randomised study lasting eight weeks in patients with diabetic nephropathy. SETTING--Outpatient nephrology clinics. PATIENTS--40 Patients with type I diabetes and diabetic nephropathy with reduced renal function. INTERVENTION--Antihypertensive treatment with enalapril or metoprolol, usually combined with frusemide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Arterial blood pressure and urinary excretion of albumin and protein. RESULTS--Arterial blood pressure after eight weeks was 135/82 (SD 13/7) mm Hg in the group given enalapril and 136/86 (16/12) mm Hg in the group given metoprolol. Proteinuria and albuminuria were similar in both groups before randomisation. After eight weeks' treatment, the geometric mean albumin excretion was 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.2) g/24 h in the patients given enalapril and 1.6 (1.1 to 2.5) g/24 h in the patients given metoprolol (p less than 0.02). The proteinuria was 1.1 (0.7 to 1.7) and 2.4 (1.6 to 3.6) g/24 h respectively (p less than 0.02). CONCLUSIONS--Antihypertensive treatment with enalapril reduced proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy more than an equally effective antihypertensive treatment with metoprolol. This points to a specific antiproteinuric effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor independent of the effect on systemic blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--(a) To compare current vocational training in general practice with that ascertained by a survey in 1980; (b) to compare the training of trainees in formal training schemes with that of trainees arranging their own hospital and general practice posts. DESIGN--National questionnaire survey of United Kingdom and armed services trainees who were in a training practice on 1 April 1989. Questionnaires were distributed by course organisers. SETTING--Research project set up after an ad hoc meeting of trainees at the 1988 national trainee conference. SUBJECTS--2132 Of the 2281 trainees (93%) known to be in a training practice on 1 April 1989. RESULTS--1657 Trainees returned the questionnaires, representing 73% of all trainees known to be in a training practice on 1 April 1989. Between 1980 and 1989 there were significant improvements in the trainee year, and there was also evidence of improvements in general practice study release courses. There was no evidence of improvement in other aspects of training. General practice trainees spent an average of three years in junior hospital posts, which provided very little opportunity for study related to general practice. Training received during tenure of hospital posts differed significantly between trainees in formal schemes and those arranging their own hospital posts. During the trainee year training was almost the same for those in formal schemes and those arranging their own posts. Regions varied significantly in virtually all aspects of general practice training. CONCLUSIONS--The trainee year could be improved further by enforcing the guidelines of the Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice. The poor training in junior hospital posts reflected the low priority that training is generally given during tenure of these posts. A higher proportion of general practice trainees should be attached to vocational training schemes. More hospital trainees could attend general practice study release courses if these were designed specifically with the needs of hospital doctors in mind.\r"

In situ extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the treatment of choice for upper and distal ureteric calculi, with success rates of 81 and 76% respectively. Retrograde manipulation of the calculus was undertaken only when in situ ESWL was impossible because of difficulty in localisation. Although ESWL after successful mobilisation was successful in 95% of patients, retrograde mobilisation was possible in only 80%. Antegrade ureterorenoscopy via a percutaneous nephrostomy was performed to avoid open surgery if retrograde mobilisation was not feasible, and was successful in 90%. Two second generation lithotripters, the modified Dornier HM3+ and the Wolf Piezolith 2200, both suitable for treatment without anaesthesia, were compared in terms of efficacy. In situ ESWL of upper ureteric calculi was successful in 70.6% with the HM3+ and 37.2% with the Piezolith 2200. In situ ESWL of middle ureteric calculi was successful in 81.8% with the modified HM3+, while in situ treatment of middle ureteric calculi was impossible with the Piezolith 2200 because of inadequate ultrasound localisation. Distal ureteric calculi were treated successfully in 71.4% with the modified Dornier HM3+ and in 64% with the Piezolith 2200. We report our experience of ESWL using the prone position for iliac ureteric calculi; 8 of 10 patients were treated successfully in situ.\r"

  ".W": "Serum acid phosphatase activity (ACP), prostate specific phosphatase (PAP) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) were measured in 100 patients with prostatic cancer. The patients were divided into 4 groups: T1-2 MO, T3-4 MO and M1 patients with less than or equal to 10 or greater than 10 metastatic foci in bone scintigraphy. The mean serum ACP levels were almost identical in the T1-2 MO and T3-4 MO groups and there was no significant difference between the mean PAP values. Significantly higher PSA levels were observed in the MO patients in the extracapsular category compared with those in the intracapsular category. The mean serum levels of all 3 tumour markers were significantly higher in the M1 than in the MO category. PSA seems to be the marker of choice as a diagnostic aid for differentiating between patients with intracapsular and those with extracapsular tumour growth. In prostatic cancer patients with bone metastases these markers were of similar value for staging the disease.\r"

  ".W": "The red cell membrane stearic acid to oleic acid ratio was analysed in 34 men with histologically proven carcinoma of the prostate and distant metastases. This ratio was expressed as the saturation index (SI). A mean SI of 0.97 was found in control patients without evidence of any malignancy whereas all patients with advanced prostatic cancer showed a reduced stearic to oleic acid ratio (mean SI 0.466). Untreated patients had a significantly lower SI (mean 0.36) than those who had responded to hormonal therapy (mean 0.547; P less than 0.0001). A drop in SI correlated well with more advanced disease as judged by radiological findings and serum PSA. It is suggested that red cell membrane SI correlates well with radiological and biochemical markers of advanced prostatic carcinoma and may be used as a marker to assess progress and response to treatment.\r"

  ".W": "There is little information on histological changes in prostate cancer during the course of the disease. We have studied 74 patients with carcinoma of the prostate who required 2 transurethral resections of the prostate (mean interval between resections 2.4 years). They constituted 18.4% of all patients with carcinoma of the prostate presenting to our clinic between January 1978 and April 1988. All tumours were staged by conventional methods and graded using the Gleason system. The Gleason sum score in those patients with tumour in both specimens increased in 49, remained constant in 12 and decreased in 7. Within this group were 34 patients who were treated expectantly. The mean Gleason sum scores in this group increased, with a concomitant increase in local tumour stage and development of metastases. Although this was not a randomised trial, there was no significant difference in survival between patients having \"deferred\" management and those treated immediately, either from time of diagnosis or from time of second resection. There was, however, a significant difference in the time to second resection, with the \"deferred\" group requiring repeat resection on average 1 year earlier. This study confirmed the concept of tumour de-differentiation with time and showed that this phenomenon occurs in both treated and untreated tumours. Although overall survival was not influenced by the type of initial therapy or its timing, local progression, as assessed by the need for further TURP, occurred earlier in those not receiving immediate therapy.\r"

Such a tumour may be preceded by carcinoma in situ (CIS), which is more common in patients with infertility, atrophic testis or a history of cryptorchism. Of 1219 patients with TGCT seen at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 1962 and 1984 in whom the contralateral testis was managed by surveillance, 38 (3.1%) developed a second tumour and 8 died of germ cell tumours. Seventeen of 26 assessable patients (65%) exhibited at least one of the known aetiological risk factors for carcinoma in situ. Diagnosis of carcinoma in situ may lead to more appropriate management of the contralateral testis.\r"

The results indicated that grand rounds continued to be the principal teaching exercise of the departments. Of the respondents 98% felt that the quality had improved or stayed the same. The overall attendance was considered to have improved or remained unchanged for the past decade by 75%; 25% thought that it had declined. The diminished emphasis on patient-related topics concerned 10%. The respondents gave numerous suggestions, which should help organizers to improve the impact of grand rounds on learning.\r"

The origin of the outbreak was not determined, and an epidemiologic link between all the patients could not be demonstrated. The isolates were found to contain the same plasmid; this suggested that a single clone of Haemophilus ducreyi was responsible for the outbreak.\r"

  ".W": "In 1985, the authors began a phase II study to assess the PCV perioperative polychemotherapy (cisplatin 100 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, vindesine 3 mg/m2) in patients with resectable bronchogenic non-small cell carcinoma. Patients were randomized to receive either two preoperative courses of PCV chemotherapy, surgery, and two postoperative courses of PCV chemotherapy (PCV group) or immediate surgery (surgery group). A staging procedure using the CT scan was performed before randomization and, additionally, before surgery in the PCV group. There were 26 randomized patients, 13 in each group. In the PCV group, 11 patients agreed to receive the two preoperative courses of chemotherapy. A response was observed in five patients (45%), and a progression was observed in four patients (36%) leading to a cancellation of surgery in two of them. Postoperative care was the same for each group. Although no death could be related to chemotherapy, it was decided to stop entering new patients into this trial because of the rate of preoperative progression in the PCV group.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the feasibility and toxicity of combining leucovorin (CF) with a 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combination chemotherapy regimen currently accepted by many as standard treatment for gastric cancer, CF (500 mg/m2) was administered in combination with the Georgetown 5-FU, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C (FAM) regimen. Thirty-two patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach were evaluable for toxicity and 26 patients with measurable disease were evaluable for response. Fifty-four percent of patients were previously treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The response rate was 38% (95% confidence interval, 21% to 59%). The median duration of response was 6 months (range, 2 to 23+ months). The estimated median survival time was 6.8 months for patients with measurable disease and 11.5 months for all 32 patients. Although diarrhea is dose limiting when 5-FU and CF are administered weekly for 6 of 8 weeks, diarrhea occurred rarely on this combination regimen with 5-FU and CF administered only 4 of every 8 weeks. The dose-limiting toxicity of FAM-CF was cumulative myelosuppression, which also occurs with the standard FAM regimen. As a result, the administered dose intensity of 5-FU decreased as patients continued on study. Thus, a randomized comparison of FAM with FAM-CF would not determine whether CF modulation increases the efficacy of 5-FU when it is administered in optimal doses to patients with gastric cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Based on laboratory studies showing enhanced cytotoxicity of floxuridine (FUDR) when used with high doses of leucovorin (LV), a pilot study of FUDR and LV through an implantable pump was initiated for the treatment of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. The highest dose of LV that could be administered, taking into account the constraints of the capacity of the pump and the solubility of LV, was 120 mg/m2/d. Due to the possibility of added toxicity, 25% of this dose was initially used. Twenty-four patients were treated at three dose levels. Eight patients were treated with the combination of LV (30 mg/m2/d) and FUDR (0.3 mg/kg/d) for a 14-day infusion through the pump, alternating with 2 weeks of saline. All eight patients had a greater than 50% decrease in measurable disease (PR) and a greater than 50% decrease in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) value; however, sclerosing cholangitis developed in two of these patients within 4 months. The next seven patients were treated with a lower dose of FUDR (0.2 mg/kg/d) and the same dose of LV, both for 14 days. Four of seven patients had a PR, and toxicity was decreased with no biliary sclerosis. A third regimen explored the combination of FUDR (0.3 mg/kg/d) and LV (30 mg/m2/d) for 7 days, alternating with 1 week of saline, to evaluate a shorter interval of treatment with the same overall dose intensity. Six of nine patients had a PR and all patients had a greater than 50% decrease in CEA value; sclerosing cholangitis developed in three of these patients. The overall response rate was 72%, with 18 of 25 patients alive after 1 year. The median survival time has not been determined, but it is greater than 27 months. FUDR with LV appeared to be effective in the treatment of hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma, but hepatic toxicity appeared to be greater than that previously reported with FUDR alone.\r"

  ".W": "Five responses (lung metastases, three; lymph node metastases, two) were observed in 23 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who received recombinant interferon-alpha-2A (IFN) 18 X 10(6) U in three intramuscular doses each week combined with oral prednisone (10 to 20 mg daily). The response duration was 4+, 4+, 9, 11+, and 15+ months. In general, the combination treatment of interferon and prednisone lead to a significant reduction of the subjective side effects (flu-like symptoms) as compared to a previous experience in patients treated with interferon only. Reduction of the interferon dose or discontinuation of IFN treatment was necessary in only two of 23 patients receiving IFN plus prednisone. Prednisone, however, had little effect on the hepatic toxicity often associated with high-dose IFN treatment. The subjective tolerability of a high dose of IFN is significantly increased if oral prednisone (10-20 mg) is given concomitantly in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma without reducing the response rate. Randomized trials will be necessary to confirm the efficacy of the IFN and prednisone combination. In addition, higher doses of IFN combined with prednisone should be evaluated in this malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the resting energy expenditure (REE) modifications observed during successive intensive identical chemotherapy courses in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients to assess indirectly the metabolic changes induced by the cytotoxic effect of drugs on the tumor. With this therapeutic regimen, reduction of tumor mass is mostly achieved during the first course of chemotherapy. The study included 10 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma adult patients receiving three intensive 5-day courses of Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), cyclophosphamide, vindesine, and bleomycin. Resting energy expenditure was evaluated by indirect calorimetry during each course, first within the first 2 days before chemotherapy and then on days 2, 3 and 5. Initial REE (day 0) on entry into the study (21.8 +/- 1.2 kcal/kg.d-1) represented 99 +/- 6.7% of theoretical REE. Resting energy expenditure on day 0 was lower during course 2 and 3 (19.1 +/- 0.7 and 18.4 +/- 1.8 kcal/kg/d) than during course 1 (21.8 +/- 1.2 kcal/kg/d). The REE profile was different among the 3 courses: course 1 induced a significant REE decrease on days 3 and 5 (P less than 0.01); during course 2, REE remained stable and was lower than during course 1; during course 3, REE increased on days 2, 3, and 5 (P less than 0.05). Energy balance was positive during the three courses and nutritional status remained stable. The REE decrease observed during course 1 may be regarded as the metabolic effect of chemotherapy on the tumor metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Therapy-related acute non-lymphocytic leukemia or preleukemia was observed in five of 71 patients with advanced breast cancer treated with combination chemotherapy comprising prednimustine, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, mitoxantrone, and tamoxifen. In this closely followed cohort of patients the cumulative risk of leukemic complications was 25.4% +/- 10.3% (+/- SE) 37 months after start of chemotherapy. The relative risk of overt leukemia was 339 (95% CI: 41-1223), as two cases were observed versus 0.0059 cases expected. The very high risk of leukemia and preleukemia observed may partly reflect the advanced age of the patients (mean, 61 years) and partly the diagnostic procedures used, which included cytogenetic screening of all patients developing refractory cytopenia. A particularly high leukemogenic effect of prednimustine or a synergism between prednimustine and other drugs used in this study cannot be excluded. In the light of the above results, the authors caution against the use of intensive combination chemotherapy with alkylating agents as in the current study in potentially curable patients with breast cancer.\r"

Thirty-two patients aged 18 to 67 years have received 127 courses of treatment. The dose of DTIC was 1.0 g/m2 as a 24-hour infusion every 28 days on day 1. Recombinant interleukin-2 (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0 x 10(6) Cetus units/m2) was administered as a 30-minute infusion on days 15 through 19 and 22 through 26 of each 28-day cycle. Seven of 32 patients (22%) who received therapy had a remission, one complete and six partial. The complete response was in a lung mass. Partial responses were seen in lymph nodes, liver, and lung. The median duration of response was 4.7 months. One patient is in persistent partial remission of the liver for greater than 2 years. One patient had residual mediastinal disease resected after partial response and remains without evidence of disease for 18+ months. This regimen was generally well tolerated, did not create overlapping toxicity, and produced encouraging responses in visceral sites. This provides a framework for future combinations of chemotherapy with rIL-2 alone or in combination with other biologic response modifiers in an outpatient setting.\r"

  ".W": "Irradiation (RT) field selection for bronchogenic carcinoma is based on such factors as extent of disease, pulmonary function, and the perceived need for elective nodal irradiation (ENI). A technique of superimposing a patient's RT treatment film onto his quantitative perfusion lung scan can predict the fractional volume of perfused lung receiving RT and has been shown to reliably estimate the minimum post-RT pulmonary function as measured by the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). This technique has been applied to 20 patients with nonresected clinically staged T1-4N0M0 lesions to quantify the pulmonary impact of varying degrees of ENI. The five treatment volumes selected were as follows: (1) tumor volume plus a 2-cm margin; (2) volume 1 plus ipsilateral hilum; (3) volume 2 plus mediastinum; (4) volume 3 plus supraclavicular fossae; and (5) volume 4 plus contralateral hilum. The median pre-RT FEV1 was 2.0 l, and the median predicted minimal post-RT FEV1 for each proposed field was field 1, 1.7 l; field 2, 1.5 l; field 3, 1.3 l; field 4, 1.1.; and field 5, 1.0 l. The decline in median predicted FEV1 with each increase in field size ranged from 2% to 12%, with a broad range of declines for each field. Such quantification can aid in decisions regarding ENI for patients with impaired pulmonary function.\r"

One hundred thirty-four patients had undergone one breast biopsy, four patients had undergone two breast biopsies, and one patient had undergone three breast biopsies. The median interval from completion of definitive irradiation to breast biopsy was 28 months (range, 2 to 117 months). Of the 145 breast biopsies, 52% (76 of 145) were positive, and 48% (69 of 145) were negative. The positive biopsy rate was related to the type of biopsy, the location of the biopsy, and the findings on physical examination and mammography. In patients with a negative physical examination but mammographic findings of a mass, microcalcifications, or both, the positive biopsy rate was 66% (25 of 38). For patients with a mass on physical examination but a negative mammogram, the positive biopsy rate was 28% (nine of 32). For patients with a mass on physical examination and a positive mammogram, the positive biopsy rate was 72% (13 of 18). For patients undergoing an incisional or Tru-Cut (Travenol Laboratories, Deerfield, IL) needle biopsy, the positive biopsy rates were 94% (15 of 16) and 75% (three of four), respectively, whereas the positive biopsy rate for an aspiration cytology was 25% (five of 20). Of the 76 positive biopsies, 64% (49 of 76) were from an in field or marginal location. The rate of detection of a subsequent local recurrence after an initial negative biopsy was 5% (three of 66). Of the evaluable patients, the complication rate was 9% (seven of 81). This study has documented the results of breast biopsies after definitive irradiation for early stage carcinoma of the breast.\r"

When comparing T subsets alone 81.6% patients remained unchanged. On comparing nodal staging alone 55.3% patients remained unchanged. Pre-operative evaluation underestimated far more commonly than it overestimated. Mediastinal node involvement was not overestimated since any suggestion of such involvement was confirmed by mediastinal exploration.

  ".W": "Between 1965 and 1985, 367 patients received initial treatment for adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Of the 334 patients treated with curative intent, 223 had International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage I, 60 had Stage II, and 51 had Stage III/IV disease. The 5-year and 10-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates for all patients treated for Stage I disease were 73% and 70%, respectively. RFS was strongly correlated with initial bulk of disease (P = 0.002), although locoregional control (LRC) was good in all groups: 91 patients with a normal-sized cervix (tumor less than 3 cm) had a 5-year RFS rate of 88% and an actuarial LRC rate of 94%; 102 patients with lesions 3 to 5.9 cm in diameter had an RFS rate of 64% and an LRC rate of 82%; and 22 patients with bulky lesions greater than 6 cm in diameter had a comparable LRC rate of 81%, but an RFS rate of only 45%. Decreased RFS also was strongly correlated with positive lymphangiogram (LAG) results (P = 0.02) and poorly differentiated lesions (P = 0.0014). When initial primary tumor size was taken into account, there was no significant difference in RFS or LRC between patients treated with radiation (RT) alone or RT plus extrafascial hysterectomy (R + S). The 5-year and 10-year RFS rates of 60 patients who received curative therapy for Stage II disease were 32% and 25%, respectively, with an LRC rate of 62% at 5 years. Patients with bulky Stage II disease did particularly poorly, with a 5-year RFS rate of 15%. Decreased RFS was correlated with positive LAG results and poorly differentiated tumors. Most Stage II patients whose disease relapsed died with distant metastases (73%). Forty-eight patients with Stage III/IV disease treated with curative intent had a 5-year survival rate of 31% and a 5-year pelvic disease control rate of 52%. In summary, patients with small volume Stage IB lesions have excellent LRC and survival with RT alone. RT achieves good LRC of bulkier Stage I lesions, but survival decreases with increasing primary tumor size. R + S holds no apparent advantage over RT alone. Patients with more advanced disease have a high rate of relapse with frequent distant metastasis. In particular, the survival of patients with FIGO Stage II disease is much lower than what we have observed after treatment of comparable stage squamous carcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The patients were consecutively registered at the Radium Centre of Copenhagen from 1971 to 1980. The different treatment modalities of these patients are examined concerning recurrence and survival. Sixty-two patients obtained local tumor control, 36 of them were in the group of patients treated with a combination of surgery and irradiation therapy. Twenty-five patients developed distant metastasis, and six patients had disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis. The overall 5-year crude survival in this report is 46%. Tumors of the parotid salivary glands must not be neglected, as early diagnosis and treatment are vital in order to achieve better results.\r"

The overall three-year survival rate was 68%, the five-year survival rate was 61% (approximate 95% confidence interval (CI), 54-68%), and then a plateau seemed to emerge, with the ten-year survival rate being 51%. Tumor ulceration exerted a strong influence on survival: patients with ulcerated tumors had a twofold (95% CI, 1.4-2.9%) higher death rates. Conversely, the influence of tumor site and type of operation was not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. A median delay in diagnosis of 4 months was found, with 30% of patients reporting an interval longer than 6 months between first symptoms and referral to a physician; overall, however, the influence of delay in diagnosis on survival rate was not significant. Dysphonia seemed to be the symptom less promptly recognized by the patient.\r"

  ".U": "90248906\r", 
  ".W": "Between March 1983 and June 1986 127 patients with localized osteosarcoma of the extremity were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Preoperative chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of methotrexate (MTX) (high or moderate doses) followed by 6 days by cisplatin (CDP). Surgery was an amputation or a rotation plasty, or a limb salvage. Necrosis was good in 52% of cases, fair in 36%, and poor in 12%. Postoperative chemotherapy consisted of Adriamycin (doxorubicin [ADM]) and bleomycin (BCD) for poor responders; and ADM, MTX, and CDP for fair responders. Good responders were treated as fair responders or with only MTX and CDP. At a 47-month follow-up, 66 patients remained continuously disease free and 61 patients developed metastases. Six of these patients had also a local recurrence. According to the grade of necrosis, the cumulative disease-free probability at 5 years was 67% for good responders, 42% for fair responders, and for poor responders 10% at 45 months. According to the doses of MTX, survival at 5 years was 58% for patients who received high doses and 42% for patients treated with moderate doses. No differences in the rate of survivors were observed between amputated patients and patients treated with limb salvage. The authors conclude that (1) a limb salvage procedure is possible in about 70% of cases and as safe as demolitive surgery, if adequate surgical margins are achieved; (2) good responders have a better prognosis than fair and poor responders if postoperative chemotherapy is sufficiently prolonged and also includes ADM; (3) a different postoperative chemotherapy for poor responders did not improve their prognosis; and (4) a multidrug regimen using high doses of MTX is probably more effective than moderate doses.\r"

The authors recently reported detailed immunophenotypic characteristics in 36 cases of LBL, including a single case of LBL with a surface immunoglobulin-positive B-cell phenotype. Three additional patients with LBL whose cells expressed monoclonal serum immunoglobulins are presented here. In addition, the neoplastic lymphocytes expressed several B-cell-associated antigens. The tumor cells in the single case tested were TdT-negative. Despite the unusual immunologic phenotype, the morphologic features in all three cases were characteristic of LBL.

The repeat biopsies were done from 5 months to 15 years after the diagnosis. Four low-grade lymphomas according to the Working Formulation transformed into intermediate-grade lymphomas (four of 11, 36%), and four intermediate-grade lymphomas into high-grade lymphomas during the follow-up (four of 16, 25%), and five of these eight transformed lymphomas were fatal within 18 months after relapse. The SPF correlated strongly with poor prognosis if measured either from the primary biopsy (P = 0.008), the first (P = 0.009), or the latest repeat biopsy (P = 0.006). If SPF was greater than or equal to 6% larger in a repeat biopsy than at presentation prognosis was poor; six of nine such patients died from lymphoma within 11 months from recurrence. An increase of greater than or equal to 6% in the SPF was more common in high-grade (four of nine, 44%) and intermediate-grade (four of 16, 25%) lymphomas than in low-grade lymphomas (one of 11, 9%), and it was occasionally (three of nine) associated with a morphologic change. In a few cases a repeat biopsy was diploid despite DNA aneuploidy at presentation. In conclusion, the study provides evidence that not only may low-grade lymphomas transform into higher grade lymphomas, but high-grade lymphomas may also frequently transform into more malignant forms during the course of the disease. The SPF is useful in monitoring the biological behavior of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and it appears to give information not obtained by histologic study alone.\r"

By clinical staging Patients 1 and 2 were Stage IV-S, a disease with limited metastatic potential and generally favorable outcome; Patient 3 was Stage IV. Southern blots of chromosomal DNA showed normal N-myc copy number in the primary tumor of Patient 1, extensive (200-fold) gene amplification in the primary tumor from Patient 2, and intermediate (100-fold) gene amplification in the primary tumor and metastatic lesions from Patient 3. N-myc RNA was expressed in all of the primary and metastatic tumor tissues tested. The level of N-myc RNA expression roughly corresponded to the extent of N-myc gene amplification in Patients 2 and 3 and was overexpressed from a single N-myc gene copy in Patient 1. N-myc gene amplification and RNA expression levels were approximately the same in the primary and metastatic lesions for each of the patients tested. The two patients with N-myc gene amplification had a poor outcome, but the patient with normal N-myc gene copy number had no evidence of disease. Despite the clinical picture in Patient 2 of Stage IV-S neuroblastoma, the pattern of N-myc amplification and expression more closely resembled that of Patient 3 (Stage IV neuroblastoma) than that of Patient 1 (bona fide Stage IV-S neuroblastoma).\r"

This study estimated how the favorable and unfavorable effects of CEA monitoring affect life expectancy and quality of life of colon cancer patients. These effects were simulated using a Markov analysis for which the variables had been defined on the basis of data found in literature. The influence of CEA monitoring on quality adjusted life expectancy appears to be modest and varies, according to the data used, from an average increase of +7 days (+0.3%) to an average decrease of -5 days (-0.09%). This value is dependent, among other things, on patient related variables; the adverse effects especially dominate in older patients with a favorable Dukes' stage of the primary tumor and if operative mortality exceeds 2%. The total cost of CEA monitoring, including diagnosis and therapy performed as a result of true- or false-positive CEA rise, is considerable. High cost and low return leads to a high marginal cost-effectiveness ratio, which varies from $22,963 to $4,888,208 per quality adjusted life year saved. It is concluded that CEA monitoring should not be used for routine following of colon cancer patients, as its advantages have so far been demonstrated insufficiently.\r"

Four AC, four AIS, and one AC/SCC were positive. These results show that B-probes are an acceptable alternative to both ISH with radiolabeled probes and Southern blot hybridization (SBH), which are difficult to apply in routine pathologic laboratories. Cervical tissues infiltrated with endometrial AC were negative for HPV DNA 16/18, and it is suggested that the presence of HPV DNA 16/18 in uterine AC may be helpful in discriminating cervical AC from endometrial AC.\r"

Initial biopsy material was classified according to the Rye histopathologic classification, the grading and subclassification proposed by the British National Lymphoma Investigation (BNLI), and tumor cell concentration in sections. Tumor cell concentration as a prognostic factor turned out to be better than the other classifications. However, if macroscopic tumor burden was taken into account both tumor cell concentration and the other histopathologic classification systems lost their prognostic significance. Significantly, however, a combination of macroscopic tumor burden and tumor cell concentration, yielding an estimate of the total tumor cell burden, was even better than the macroscopic tumor burden as a prognostic factor. In conclusion, a simple tumor cell concentration count seems to be the most useful form of histopathologic subtyping for prognostic purposes in early stage Hodgkin's disease.\r"

In 68 serially resected stomachs, 5 (7.4%) new multiple cancers were detected microscopically, whereas 4 (5.9%) had already been diagnosed grossly. The incidence rate of multiple carcinoma increased to 13.2% by this procedure. The cases that were cut serially showed that most of the multiple cancers were located distally from the F-line presenting the line along which intestinal metaplasia appeared.

Intraepithelial and lamina propria inflammatory cells, basal cell layer thickness, and papillary height were quantitated. Distal esophageal sections from infant sudden death trauma victims were used to provide normal morphometric control values. The upper limit of normal for each of the four histological parameters of esophagitis was defined as the mean plus three standard deviations. The values thus derived were similar to established adult normal values. Seventy-seven percent of the patients had at least one abnormal histological parameter (intraepithelial eosinophils or neutrophils, thickened basal cell layer, or increased papillary height) and were thus considered to have esophagitis. These measures of esophagitis all correlated well with each other, providing an internal consistency to the histological interpretation. Lamina propria eosinophilia correlated highly with intraepithelial eosinophils (r = 0.98) and was found to have a sensitivity of 41% and specificity of 89% for diagnosing histological esophagitis, defined as abnormality of any of the four histological parameters. Ninety-three percent of the patients with histological esophagitis had significant reflux as determined by pH probe monitoring. However, there was generally poor correlation between the severity of the esophagitis as quantitated by morphometric parameters and severity of the reflux as measured by pH monitoring. Esophageal suction biopsies, which provide adequate specimens for morphometric interpretation, are appropriate for diagnosing reflux esophagitis in infants.\r"

We hypothesized that gastrointestinal symptoms in anorexia nervosa will decrease during refeeding despite high caloric intake, suggesting that delayed gastric emptying, where present, is a result rather than a cause of anorexia nervosa. Study goals were (a) to determine the type and frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms, (b) to follow symptoms during refeeding prospectively, and (c) to develop guidelines for gastrointestinal testing and intervention in hospitalized anorectic patients. Sixteen consecutive patients with anorexia nervosa were rated on 12 gastrointestinal symptoms before and after nutritional rehabilitation and followed up throughout treatment. All patients reported multiple gastrointestinal symptoms on admission; all symptoms except belching improved during treatment despite large calorie increases (p less than 0.0002); significant improvements occurred in appetite, bloating, constipation, vomiting, and diarrhea; and no patients required endoscopy, x-ray evaluation, or antipeptic regimens. We conclude that although severe gastrointestinal symptoms are common in anorexia nervosa, they improve significantly with refeeding. Specific gastrointestinal studies should be reserved for patients who do not gain weight or who have indications of independent digestive disease.\r"

In serum from normal subjects, 87% (median; range, 27%-160%) of all progastrin products were alpha-amidated gastrins, whereas they constituted only 39% (15%-130%) in serum from patients with duodenal ulcers (p less than 0.01) and 46% (16%-100%) in serum from gastrinoma patients (p less than 0.01). A significantly lower percentage of alpha-amidated gastrin was found in patients with hepatic metastases (23%) than in patients with apparently benign tumors (54%). Chromatography of serum showed that large progastrin molecules occurred mainly in patients with malignant tumors, whereas smaller glycine-extended precursors dominated in patients with benign tumors. The results indicate that the total progastrin product reflects tumor synthesis of gastrin better than conventional measurements of alpha-amidated gastrin. Moreover, the results suggest that a low degree of processing of progastrin could serve as a predictor of a malignant clinical course at an early stage of the disease.\r"

There was an increase in the intensity of immunoreactivity in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- and neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactive nerve fibers and neurons and a decrease in calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity but no change in substance P- and dopamine beta-hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity in the nerve fibers and neurons of the submucous plexus of both 8- and 16-wk streptozocin-diabetic rat ileum. However, in the myenteric plexus of the diabetic rat ileum, there was enlargement of varicosities and an increase followed by a slight decrease in the intensity of immunoreactivity of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- and dopamine beta-hydroxylase-like immunoreactive nerve fibers and neurons, increased substance P-like immunoreactivity in diabetes at 16 wk, and an initial decrease (at 8 wk) followed by a recovery of calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity at 16 wk, but no change in neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity. The markedly different changes in peptidergic and adrenergic nerves between the two enteric plexuses show that diabetic neuropathy induced by streptozocin is not selective and involves factors other than neurotransmitter types.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether decreased tissue vasoactive intestinal polypeptide levels might affect inhibitory neural input, fresh colonic specimens were obtained from patients with Crohn's colitis (n = 7) and normal subjects (n = 13). Immunoreactive vasoactive intestinal polypeptide levels were measured in the muscularis externa by radioimmunoassay and localized in tissue sections by immunostaining. Circular muscle strips were maintained in an organ bath; inhibitory junction potentials evoked by short- and long-duration field stimulation and resting membrane potentials were recorded using intracellular impalements. In Crohn's colitis, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide levels displayed a bimodal distribution in which 3 specimens had vasoactive intestinal polypeptide levels greater than or equal to 4 SE lower than the mean in normal specimens. In 3 specimens from Crohn's colitis with decreased vasoactive intestinal polypeptide levels, immunoreactive material was absent from the circular muscle layer and the myenteric plexus. Mean resting membrane potentials, mean amplitude of inhibitory junction potentials evoked by short-duration stimulation, and mean amplitude of initial inhibitory junction potentials evoked by long-duration stimulation were not different between the two groups. However, the mean amplitude of the 60th inhibitory junction potential during prolonged stimulation was decreased (p less than 0.01) in Crohn's colitis (6 mV) compared with normal specimens (11 mV). These results show that diminished neural input to circular muscle in Crohn's colitis was associated with decreased extractable vasoactive intestinal polypeptide levels and decreased staining of nerve fibers containing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide.\r"

Because these intestinal properties are highly dependent on rates of nucleic acid and protein synthesis, in vivo incorporation of thymidine, uridine, and leucine into small intestinal deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and proteins were measured. Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was markedly decreased with the lowest thymidine incorporation in the jejunum (p less than 0.01); these findings were confirmed by autoradiographic identification of radiolabeled nuclei in the intestinal crypts. Protein synthesis was decreased by 6 h postinjury (p less than 0.01) but had returned to normal by 48 h. Consistent with a decreased rate of protein synthesis, ribonucleic acid synthesis was also decreased 18 h postinjury (p less than 0.01). These decreased deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and protein synthesis rates are not likely a result of ischemia because in other studies of this injury model, intestinal blood flow was not significantly changed by the burn injury. Potentially, factors initiating the acute inflammatory reaction may directly inhibit nucleic acid and protein synthesis and lead to alterations in nutrient absorption and intestinal barrier function after injury.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated whether intracellular glutathione is cytoprotective against ethanol-induced injury to cultured rat gastric mucosal cells in vitro. Secondly, it investigated whether reduced glutathione or oxidized glutathione is responsible for this cytoprotection. Cytolysis was quantified by measuring 51Cr release from prelabeled cells. Concentrations of ethanol greater than 12% caused cell damage and increased 51Cr release in a dose-dependent and time-related fashion. When a substrate for glutathione synthesis, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, was provided to cultured cells for 4 h before challenge with ethanol, cytolysis was significantly decreased corresponding with an increase in cellular glutathione content. Pretreatment with diethyl maleate, which depletes reduced glutathione without forming oxidized glutathione, potentiated ethanol-induced cell damage in a dose-dependent manner with the decrease of cellular glutathione content. The administration of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (which is specifically reduced by glutathione peroxidase to generate oxidized glutathione from reduced glutathione) or diamide (which nonenzymatically oxidizes reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione) enhanced ethanol injury. We conclude that in cultured gastric mucosal cells, (a) intracellular glutathione maintains integrity of gastric mucosal cells against ethanol in vitro; and (b) reduced glutathione rather than oxidized glutathione is responsible for this cytoprotection. We postulate that the presence of reduced glutathione is essential to allow glutathione peroxidase to catalyze the ethanol-generated toxic oxygen radical, hydrogen peroxide.\r"

Eight normal subjects (age 20-30 yr) were studied by concurrent transnasal video laryngoscopy, pharyngeal intraluminal manometry, and submental surface electromyography. The manometric, electromyographic, and both video recordings were synchronized with one another using a specially designed event marker. Dry, 5-ml water, and 5-ml barium swallows were recorded. Frame-by-frame analysis of the video endoscopic recordings showed that deglutitive laryngeal kinetics consisted of vocal cord adduction associated with transverse approximation of the arytenoids followed by vertical approximation of arytenoids to the base of the epiglottis followed by laryngeal ascent and epiglottic descent. Onset of swallow-induced vocal cord adduction preceded the onset of hyoid bone movement, base of the tongue movement, and submental surface myoelectric activity by 0.33 +/- 0.04 (SE) s, 0.31 +/- 0.04 s, and 0.38 +/- 0.04 s, respectively. Onset of vocal cord adduction also preceded the initiation of peristalsis in the nasopharynx and its propagation to oropharynx and upper esophageal sphincter by 0.64 +/- 0.05 s, 0.82 +/- 0.05 s, and 1.08 +/- 0.04 s, respectively. The time between the onset of vocal cord adduction and their return to full opening was 2.2 +/- 0.09 s. It was concluded that (a) among events evaluated, vocal cord adduction is the initial event during the swallowing sequence; (b) laryngeal kinetics during deglutition have distinctive features, and their close coordination with other swallowing events suggests that they are an essential feature of the swallowing program; and (c) abnormal laryngeal kinetics or lack of coordination between the glottic closure mechanism and oropharyngeal bolus transport may have an important role in swallow-induced aspiration.\r"

To estimate prevalence, 369 clients of Planned Parenthood of Maryland were asked whether gas, diarrhea, or constipation occurred during menstruation. These subjects were compared with women referred to a gastroenterology clinic and found to have irritable bowel syndrome or functional bowel disorder (abdominal pain plus altered bowel habits but not satisfying restrictive criteria for irritable bowel syndrome). Thirty-four percent of 233 Planned Parenthood clients who denied symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome or functional bowel disorder reported that menstruation was associated with one or more bowel symptoms. Gastroenterology clinic patients with irritable bowel syndrome were significantly more likely to experience exacerbations of each of these bowel symptoms, but especially increased bowel gas. Self-reports of bowel symptoms during menstruation were not associated with psychological traits or with menses-related changes in affect.\r"

Adrenalectomy, as well as pretreatment with a vasopressin V1-receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the gastric inhibitory effect in response to stress. In contrast, neither truncal vagotomy nor hypophysectomy or opiate blockade prevented stress-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion. These findings indicate that stress-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion in rats is mediated by autonomic, noradrenergic efferents as well as by adrenal and vasopressin-dependent pathways. Vagal efferents, opiate pathways, and the pituitary gland do not seem to be involved.\r"

  ".W": "Ion transport across premalignant large bowel mucosa in CF1 mice was evaluated by measuring sodium and chloride fluxes across voltage-clamped colonic segments obtained from control animals and animals treated for 4 wk with the procarcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, which induces tumor development principally in the distal colon. In control CF1 mouse colon, the net flux of sodium was 5.1 +/- 0.7 and 4.6 +/- 0.7 microEq.cm-2.h-1 and the net flux of chloride was 6.1 +/- 1.3 and 0.8 +/- 1.2 microEq.cm-2.h-1 in the distal and proximal colon, respectively. Removal of bicarbonate decreased the net flux of sodium 1.5 +/- 0.5 and 1.9 +/- 0.7 microEq.cm-2.h-1 in the distal and proximal colon, respectively, while the net flux of chloride was decreased to 1.7 +/- 1.8 microEq.cm-2.h-1 in the distal colon but was unaltered (0.8 +/- 0.1 microEq.cm-2.h-1) in the proximal colon. Addition of 25 mM bicarbonate stimulated the net flux of sodium and chloride absorption in the distal colon but increased net flux of sodium absorption alone in the proximal colon and stimulated net flux of chloride secretion. Removal of chloride decreased net flux of sodium to 3.4 +/- 1.4 and 1.8 +/- 0.8 microEq.cm-2.h-1 in the distal and proximal colon, respectively. Addition of 20 mM Cl stimulated net flux of sodium in the distal but not the proximal colon. These data suggest that sodium absorption is mediated by an electroneutral Cl-dependent, HCO3-dependent process (i.e., Na-H Cl-HCO3 dual exchange) in control distal colon and by an electroneutral HCO3-dependent process in control proximal colon. Following 1,2-dimethylhydrazine treatment, net flux of sodium in the distal colon was not stimulated by the addition of Cl or HCO3, and transport in the proximal colon was similar to that in control animals. However, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine treatment appears to uncouple Na-H Cl-HCO3 exchange in the distal colon early in the process of large bowel carcinogenesis.\r"

Substance P and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide are possible mediators of this secretory response. The objectives of this study were to investigate the in vivo effects of substance P and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide on the jejunal musculature and epithelium. Substance P caused an increase in jejunal motility, water secretion, and transmural potential difference. Cholinergic blockade did not affect the substance P-induced contractions, but did reduce the increase in transmural potential difference, suggesting an inhibition of water secretion. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide abolished motor activity; however, it induced an increase in transmural potential difference that was atropine and tetrodotoxin resistant. By immunohistochemical methods, immunoreactive vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and immunoreactive substance P were localized to both nerve cell bodies and nerve fibers in the ferret intestine. Determination of intestinal concentrations of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and substance P in the ferret showed concentrations of these two neuropeptides that were similar to those in human intestine and demonstrated much higher concentrations of these substances in the muscular layer than in the epithelial layer. Our data demonstrate that in the ferret substance P excites and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide inhibits jejunal motor activity. However, both peptides increase water secretion. Our results suggest that in response to vagal stimulation, neuronally released substance P or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide may participate in the atropine-resistant water secretion.\r"

Replacement of bathing-medium Cl and HCO3 with gluconate and HEPES abolished the short-circuit current increase, consistent with these cytokines stimulating electrogenic anion secretion. Cytokine-stimulated short-circuit current changes were inhibited by preincubation with piroxicam (10(-5) M), an inhibitor of arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase, suggesting prostaglandin formation as an intermediate step for cytokine stimulation of short-circuit current. In intact mucosal strips, interleukin 1 and 3 stimulated prostaglandin E2 release and elevated tissue 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration. When prostaglandin E2 release from epithelial and subepithelial fractions of the mucosa by interleukin 1 was determined, increases were found only from the subepithelium. The secretory actions of cytokines appear to be mediated by arachidonic acid metabolites most likely produced by cells of the lamina propria and submucosa and may play a role in inflammatory processes in which intestinal secretion is enhanced.\r"

  ".W": "Photodynamic therapy is a relatively new method for the local destruction of tumors based on the administration of a photosensitizing agent that is retained in tumors and then activated to produce cytotoxic agents following irradiation with light. The selective retention of photosensitizers by dimethylhydrazine-induced colonic tumors over adjacent normal tissue is small (2:1, tumor to normal), making the possibility of producing selective tumor necrosis with total sparing of normal tissue difficult. Colonic cancers and adjacent normal colon were treated with the same light doses from an argon-pumped dye laser 48 h after intravenous injection of 0.5 or 5 mg/kg of the photosensitizer, aluminum-sulfonated phthalocyanine. There was little difference between the amount of necrosis in the tumor and the adjacent normal colon if the injected dose of photosensitizer was 5 mg/kg. However, at the lower dose of 0.5 mg/g, up to 2 mm of necrosis could be produced in the tumor without damaging the normal colon. In vivo fluorescence measurements showed that the photosensitizer was photodegraded during irradiation. This was confirmed by in vitro fluorescence scans of the normal colon after irradiation; the fluorescence from the photosensitizer was lowest at the point of irradiation. It is postulated that at low dosage, selective necrosis can occur because the photosensitizer is photodegraded in the normal colon before a threshold photodynamic dose is reached, whereas in tumor containing twice as much photosensitizer, a photodynamic threshold dose can be achieved and necrosis produced.\r"

Constipation was present in 43%, was similar in frequency in both sexes, and was more common in patients, regardless of degree of disability, than in a control population. Frequency of constipation also correlated with duration of disease and genitourinary symptoms but did not correlate with use of any medications in mildly disabled patients. Fecal incontinence had occurred at least once in the preceding 3 mo in 51% of patients and once per week or more frequently in 25% of patients who were questioned in more detail with a follow-up questionnaire. Correlations of fecal incontinence with disability, duration of disease, and presence of genitourinary symptoms were similar to constipation. The prevalence of bowel dysfunction (constipation and/or fecal incontinence) in the multiple sclerosis population was 68%, and this manifestation was common even in mildly disabled subjects. Bowel dysfunction can be a source of considerable ongoing social disability in patients with multiple sclerosis. Further studies are needed to characterize the pathophysiology of this common disorder so that effective therapeutic strategies can be identified.\r"

Mucosal levels of angiotensin I correlated fairly well with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (r = 0.46, p less than 0.05) while angiotensin II levels correlated poorly. These studies suggest that angiotensin I and II may have a role in the inflammation associated with Crohn's colitis.\r"

Liver biopsy at the initial visit showed advanced disease (fibrosis, cirrhosis) in 61% of the patients. During prospective clinical follow-up, which was available for 37 of the 44 study patients, one or more symptoms of liver disease developed in 33 (89%); esophageal varices were found in 15 (41%), and histologic progression to cirrhosis was found in 20 (67%) of the 30 precirrhotic patients. Significant (p less than 0.01) biochemical progression was reflected by a decrease in mean serum albumin concentrations and an increase in mean serum bilirubin levels in 32 patients followed for 4-6 yr.

Treatment periods were randomly ordered, lasted 4-5 wk, and each was preceded by a 3-wk washout period. Mean cholesterol saturation index decreased from a baseline value of 1.40-0.92 on lovastatin (p less than 0.008). Mean cholesterol saturation index on ursodeoxycholic acid was 0.87 and decreased to 0.70 with the addition of lovastatin (p less than 0.030). There was a strong correlation (r = 0.87, p less than 0.003) between saturation index on ursodeoxycholic acid and the further incremental reduction in saturation index with addition of lovastatin. These findings raise the possibility that addition of lovastatin to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment might improve the efficacy of this bile salt for dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, especially in patients with a suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic acid.\r"

In the remaining three idiopathic diabetics, retinopathy was background of severe degree in two and proliferative, with impairment of vision, in one. No differences between patients with and without retinopathy were observed in fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, serum cholesterol, or triglyceride levels. The only significant difference (p less than 0.001) was the greater duration of diabetes in patients with retinopathy when compared with those without it (10.8 +/- 5.7 vs. 5.2 +/- 3.9 yr in pancreatitis patients; 11.2 +/- 5.0 vs. 5.1 +/- 3.5 yr in type 1 diabetics; mean +/- SD).

Expression of the immunoglobulin M antibody to the hepatitis delta virus is relatively weak and short-lived in self-limited hepatitis but strong and persistent in chronic forms. To study the nature of the immunoglobulin M antibody to the hepatitis delta virus in acute hepatitis D and in chronic hepatitis D, antibody-positive sera were submitted to rate zonal centrifugation to separate monomeric 7S from pentameric 19S immunoglobulin M antibodies. Sera were from 6 patients with acute self-limited hepatitis, 4 patients with chronic hepatitis D, and 6 patients with hepatitis D progressing to chronicity. The immunoglobulin M reactivity was measured by a specific immunoassay based on capture of mu-chains by anti-mu linked on a solid phase. Only 19S antibody was found in acute hepatitis D. In contrast, all patients with chronic hepatitis D circulated 7S antibody in addition to the 19S antibody. In patients with progressive hepatitis D, both the 7S and 19S antibody variants were present at the onset of the disease. The difference in the antibody response between acute hepatitis D and chronic hepatitis D is not only temporal and quantitative but also qualitative. The expression of 7S antibody seems to be an immunologic event specific for chronic hepatitis D.\r"

The 47 patients with HLA-B8 were younger (38 +/- 2 yr vs. 48 +/- 2 yr; p less than 0.01), had higher serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (658 +/- 60 U/L vs. 465 +/- 49 U/L; p = 0.02) and bilirubin (7 +/- 1 mg/dl vs. 2.8 +/- 0.4 mg/dl; p = 0.003), and more commonly had histologic features of bridging necrosis, multilobular necrosis, and cirrhosis (85% vs. 56%; p less than 0.01) at presentation than the 34 patients without HLA-B8. Remission (79% vs. 71%), relapse after drug withdrawal (76% vs. 71%), treatment failure (13% vs. 6%), progression to cirrhosis (46% vs. 32%), and death from liver failure (6% vs. 3%) occurred as frequently in patients with and without HLA-B8. Importantly, HLA-B8-negative patients with HLA-A1 relapsed less frequently than HLA-B8-positive patients with and without HLA-A1- and HLA-B8-negative counterparts without HLA-A1. It is concluded that HLA-B8-positive patients are younger and have more severe disease at presentation than HLA-B8-negative patients. The HLA-B8 phenotype does not influence the response to corticosteroid therapy. HLA-B8-negative patients with HLA-A1 relapse less frequently than other phenotypes.\r"

The concentrations of the aminoterminal propeptide of type III collagen, type IV collagen, and laminin were measured from 87 samples representing a wide range of clinical and histological severities of the disease, which were assessed with indices that have been shown to correlate well with the risk of dying within 1 yr. Significant correlations (p less than 0.00001) were found between the markers of connective tissue metabolism and the Combined Clinical and Laboratory Index: (aminoterminal propeptide of type III collagen, rs = 0.82; type IV collagen, rs = 0.82; laminin, rs = 0.81), as well as between these markers and the Combined Morphological Index: (aminoterminal propeptide of type III collagen, rs = 0.70; type IV collagen, rs = 0.68; laminin, rs = 0.64). Whereas the patients with less than 8 mM of alcohol in their morning urine (mild or moderate drinkers) showed a significant (p less than 0.00001) decrease in these markers in a period of 27 +/- 1 wk, the patients with more than 8 mM of urinary alcohol (heavy drinkers) had no improvement. It is proposed that both fibrogenesis and basement membrane formation are associated with disease severity, degree of alcoholic hepatitis, and alcohol intake, which are important determinants of prognosis in alcoholic liver disease.\r"

Two hundred nine subjects in 40 families with confirmed hemochromatosis and clear evidence of HLA linkage in symptomatic individuals were studied prospectively for up to 24 yr. The study group consisted of 40 probands, 51 subjects sharing two HLA haplotypes with affected relatives (putative homozygotes), 98 putative heterozygotes, and 20 putative normal homozygotes. Forty-eight of 51 subjects predicted to be homozygous showed increased hepatic iron stores as assessed by liver biopsy and quantitative phlebotomy. If not evident initially, this developed in 1-8 yr. In the 3 subjects predicted by HLA typing to be homozygous but in whom there was no progressive iron accumulation, results of studies using another chromosome 6 genetic marker (Factor 13 A subunit) were consistent with chromosomal recombination, presumably separating one hemochromatosis allele from the HLA markers. No heterozygous subject developed overt hemochromatosis during the period of follow-up, although 1 showed evidence of iron overload at initial assessment. Genetic recombination is again thought to have separated the hemochromatosis allele from the HLA markers here. The present findings favor a location of the hemochromatosis locus telomeric to HLA-A. It is concluded that, in this population, hemochromatosis is apparently always HLA linked, and homozygous subjects will develop iron overload in the absence of chromosomal recombination or blood loss.\r"

This observation supports the hypothesis that patients with previous acute pancreatitis and normal fasting serum triglyceride levels may have a preexistent abnormality in the metabolism of chylomicrons. To test this hypothesis, the catabolism of chylomicrons and their remnants was studied in a series of 7 patients who had sustained an attack of pancreatitis (2, gallstone related; 2, alcohol ingestion; 1, hydatid cyst; and 3, no associated pathological condition) at least 18 mo earlier. All the patients had previously had abnormal oral-fat tolerance test results. These patients were compared with a series of 6 healthy volunteers. Chylomicrons were endogenously labeled with an oral dose of retinyl palmitate, and their plasma elimination half-life was calculated. The retinyl palmitate absorption rate constants were similar in control and pancreatitis patients. The chylomicron t1/2 were 2.3 +/- 0.8 (SD) h and 3.9 +/- 1.8 h in the control and pancreatitis groups, respectively (p = 0.07). The chylomicron remnant t1/2 was 2.7 +/- 1.1 h in the control group and 5.2 +/- 2.4 h in the pancreatitis group (p less than 0.05). This study supports the hypothesis that subjects with previous acute pancreatitis may have an abnormality in the catabolism of chylomicron particles. This abnormality may represent a preexistent genetic condition expressed in either the apoprotein composition of chylomicrons or in the hepatic apolipoprotein E-receptor activity.\r"

Control animals treated with potassium (1.1 mmol/kg x h) or 0.9% NaCl alone showed no morphological change in the pancreas. Intravenous administration of calcium (0.6 mmol/kg x h) led to a 1.8-fold increase in serum ionized calcium levels in the cat and a 1.6-fold increase in levels in the guinea pig. The cat showed necrosis of acinar and ductal cells throughout the gland at 12 h. In the guinea pig, acinar cell vacuolisation and cell necrosis started at 3 h, and at 9 h degeneration of entire acini, hydropic swelling and degeneration of ductal cells, and perivascular leukocytic infiltration was present. In both species, a significant increase in the number of intraductal precipitates and a significant increase in urinary amylase output was present in calcium treated animals.

Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced by two intraperitoneal injections of cerulein (40 micrograms/kg body wt) at intervals of 1 h under water-immersion stress for 5 h, whereas water-immersion stress alone did not induce any morphologic and enzymatic changes in the pancreas. In this model, hemorrhagic pancreatitis developed continuously, and the serum amylase level and activation of zymogen proteases in pancreatic tissue were significantly higher than in cerulein-induced pancreatic tissue 5 h after the first cerulein injection. Furthermore, the effects of cerulein on the serum amylase level and activation of zymogen proteases were dose related. Even 5 micrograms/kg body wt of cerulein, which did not induce any evident edematous change in the pancreas, could activate the zymogen proteases of pancreatic tissue fairly well under water-immersion stress compared with pancreatitis induced by 40 micrograms/kg body wt of cerulein alone. These results indicate that stress accelerates the activation of zymogen proteases induced by cerulein and suggest the possibility that stress may play some role in the development of severe pancreatitis.\r"

There was no imbalance of the circulating lymphocyte subpopulations, and the in vitro responses of the patient's lymphocytes to mitogens were normal. However, there was an increased number (32%) of peripheral lymphocytes expressing interleukin 2 receptor. Serum immunoglobulin M levels were higher than in controls, and the patient's lymphocytes exhibited a spontaneous in vitro immunoglobulin M production higher than normal. Comparable increases in both interleukin 2 receptor expression and immunoglobulin M production were induced in vitro in normal peripheral lymphocyte cultures by the addition of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide concentrations similar to that detected in the patient's plasma. These findings indicate that a modulatory effect of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide on lymphocyte activation and immunoglobulin synthesis may be operating in vivo. They also suggest that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide does not mediate major defects in peripheral blood lymphocyte function in vivo.\r"

Forty two studies were of children who were well at follow up who were not receiving medical treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux, and had not required antireflux surgery. Twenty one studies were from children who were still on treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux or had undergone antireflux surgery. The results were analysed using non-parametric statistics to assess the value of pH recordings in predicting which children were likely to have continuing problems. Sleep reflux (minutes/hour) and acid clearing time were the most highly significant variables (p less than 0.0005 and p less than 0.0001 respectively). The results suggest that either sleep gastro-oesophageal reflux of more than 6.4 minutes/hour or an acid clearing time of seven minutes or more are good predictors of the clinical outcome (specificity 88.1%, sensitivity 81.0%). Three of the five children with false positive results were under 10 months of age. Positive results in this age group should therefore be interpreted with caution.\r"

Twenty four hour pH monitoring was performed using identical equipment on two consecutive days under similar conditions. Pearson correlation coefficients range from 0.88 to 0.98. The results obtained on two consecutive days were similar. The reflux index and the number of reflux episodes greater than five minutes were the most reproducible parameters. Despite the many patient related factors influencing pH data, the reproducibility of 24 hour pH monitoring data are satisfactory for routine clinical application.\r"

Of the healthy individuals, smokers had significantly lower salivary IgA and higher IgM concentrations than did non-smokers. The effect on IgA was dose related, and reversible after cessation of smoking. Likewise, in patients with head and neck tumours (the majority being smokers), salivary IgA concentration was reduced and IgM increased when compared with non-smoking controls. Results were similar before and after radiotherapy. This study provides evidence of the effects of smoking on mucosal immunity as evaluated by parotid salivary immunoglobulins.

The administration of 240 mg of colloidal bismuth subcitrate per kilogram body weight, at 12 hour intervals, for 14 days, resulted in an increase in the density of the mucosal epithelial cells, but a decreased rate of epithelial cell division in the neck region. Comparison with placebo treated animals showed that the repeated administration of colloidal bismuth subcitrate after an initial ethanol challenge, decreased the degree of damage induced by a second ethanol challenge, enhanced the rate of tissue repair and prevented the establishment of persistent erosions.\r"

The six month period prevalence of dyspepsia in the 7428 respondents to the questionnaire is 41% and equal between the sexes, with similar prevalence rates in the centres studied. There is considerable overlap between upper abdominal symptoms and symptoms of heartburn; 56% of patients with dyspepsia experience both groups of symptoms. Symptom frequency falls progressively with age in men and women, but the proportion of people seeking medical advice for dyspepsia rises with age. One quarter of the dyspeptic patients studied have consulted a general practitioner about their symptoms. This study suggests that the prevalence of dyspepsia in the community has changed little over the last 30 years, despite evidence that the frequency of peptic ulcer disease is falling. Symptom prevalence is unrelated to social class, but this factor is associated with consultation behaviour, the consultation rate rising from 17% in social class 1 to 29% in social class 4. The use of investigations--barium meal and endoscopy--is similarly related to social class; the lowest rate for ulcer diagnosis (4.7%) is found in social class 1 and the highest (17.1%) in social class 5.\r"

After incubation for eight hours or more they also stimulated the incorporation of [3H]L-leucine into cellular AIM. PGF2 alpha was considerably less potent (EC50 greater than 1 mumol/l) than the E-type prostaglandins. Iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analogue, was ineffective.\r"

  ".U": "90249787\r", 
  ".W": "Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) is a clinically useful intestinal permeability probe whose rate of intestinal permeation is influenced in part by solvent drag. As mucosal prostanoids are increased in inflammatory bowel disease and affect water transport we examined the possible relationship between prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the inhibitors of endogenous prostaglandins--the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)--on PEG 400 absorption in vivo using segmental perfusion of rat small intestine. We found that the addition of exogenous PGE2 in concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 micrograms/ml significantly (p less than 0.01) decreased PEG 400 and water absorption. Addition of 5 mmol/l of the cyclooxygenase inhibitors acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or indomethacin in concentrations 2.5 or 5.0 mmol/l to the perfusate significantly (p less than 0.01) increased PEG 400 and water absorption. The simultaneous addition of 1.0 micrograms/ml of exogenous PGE2 to the perfusate with 5 mmol/l of ASA or with 2.5 mmol/l of indomethacin reversed the increase of PEG 400 and water transport (p less than 0.01). There were no differences in PEG 400 and water absorption when PGE2 was given alone or in combination with ASA or indomethacin. This study suggests that endogenous or exogenous prostanoids play an important role in the regulation of PEG 400 permeation. PGE2 and NSAIDS modify PEG 400 permeation in parallel with changes in water transport indicating that their effect on permeability is through changes in solvent drag. These findings provide a mechanism which might explain the increase in PEG 400 intestinal permeability in Crohn's disease patients and the increase in intestinal permeability found in patients receiving NSAIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies were used to determine the relative numbers of T lymphocyte subsets in 61 jejunal biopsies and in peripheral blood of 35 children with coeliac disease, and of 13 healthy controls. The T cell numbers in the lamina propria were unaffected by a change from gluten-free to gluten containing diet in the patients. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (where the CD8 cells predominated) were significantly raised in patients taking gluten. Ten to 20% of the patients' intraepithelial CD3 (mature T) cells expressed neither CD8 nor CD4 surface antigens. This CD4 8 T cell population persisted through gluten elimination and challenge. The circulating lymphocyte subsets showed little variation with the diet although there was a marked increase in the proportion (14.9%) of CD4 8 T cells in patients during gluten elimination. In the histologically normal jejunal mucosa from control subjects, the age of the subject showed a positive correlation with villus intraepithelial CD3+ and CD8+ cells, and crypt intraepithelial CD4+ cells. No clear cut effect of age was observed on lamina propria lymphocyte counts of the controls, or on the lymphocyte counts in jejunal mucosa of the coeliac patients. The observed CD3+4-8- lymphocytes may represent activated cells unable to present their surface antigens, or they may be gamma delta-receptor bearing T cells, which could have a significant role in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease.\r"

This difference was not explained by age, duration, activity, or treatment.

  ".U": "90249790\r", 
  ".W": "The proportion of oligosaccharide chains on the Fc fragment of IgG which terminate with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) rather than galactose is increased in rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculosis, and in sera from patients with Crohn's disease, probably because of decreased activity of a galactosyltransferase in B lymphocytes. We have assayed the prevalence of agalactosyl oligosaccharides on IgG in sera from 67 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (32 ulcerative colitis and 35 Crohn's disease). The prevalence of agalactosyl IgG significantly increases in the majority of Crohn's patients (19/35 patients), and correlates with the level of C-reactive protein (r = 0.79), and inversely with the concentration of serum albumin. Sera from ulcerative colitis patients show less frequent (nine of 32) and less marked rises in agalactosyl IgG, and sera with high C-reactive protein values can contain normal levels. Thus in ulcerative colitis no correlation was seen between the two assays. The diseases in which the percentage of agalactosyl IgG is raised (rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, Crohn's disease and some ulcerative colitis) are characterised by simultaneous T cell mediated granulomatous tissue damage, and acute phase responses. Levels are normal in less tissue damaging granulomatous conditions, including sarcoidosis, and leprosy (except during episodes of erythema nodosum leprosum). We suggest therefore that a raised percentage of agalactosyl IgG is a correlate of a particular type of T cell mediated pathology which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

  ".W": "Infusion of fat into the ileum slows small bowel transit and increases absorption of a carbohydrate meal. Paired studies were undertaken to investigate the effect of adding fat to the diet on gastrointestinal transit and absorption in eight people with terminal ileostomies. Each subject ate a daily diet that contained either low or high levels of fat but equivalent amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fibre. Solid and liquid markers were added to the food to measure transit times. The ileostomy outputs after the meals were analysed for protein, fat, carbohydrate, polyethylene glycol, and the delivery of solid markers. All subjects produced more ileal effluent while taking the high fat diet compared with the low fat diet. Fat and protein outputs were significantly higher on the high fat days, but a greater proportion of the fat was absorbed during the high fat diet compared with the low fat diet. The output of carbohydrate on the two diets was not significantly different. The incorporation of fat in the diet produced no significant differences in the transit times of the first marker, but a slight prolongation of the transit time of the second marker. Increasing the fat content of the diet did not slow small bowel transit or increase nutrient absorption. The increase in protein and water output could be explained by an increased secretion of pancreatic enzymes.\r"

Healthy volunteers had the caecum intubated from above with a device that permitted intraluminal pressures to be recorded while fluids were instilled into the caecum. Perfusates contained 99mTc-DTPA (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid) and volumes of the right colon were determined by two plane scintigraphy using gamma cameras. Different individuals received caecal infusions of 154 mM NaC1 (saline), an emulsion of oleic acid (with bile acids and lecithin) or a 100 mM solution of mixed short chain fatty acids. Each person was pretreated by intravenous saline (placebo), morphine sulphate (100 micrograms/kg) or naloxone (5.5 mg as a bolus, followed by 10 micrograms/kg/min). Volumes of the right colon were smallest during oleic acid infusion; morphine reversed the effect of luminal fat and allowed the colon to accommodate larger volumes. Transit from the right colon was more rapid for the emulsion of oleic acid than it was for saline or solutions of mixed short chain fatty acids. We conclude that the right colon may act as a reservoir and that this function can be modified by the nature of the contents and by pharmacological agents.\r"

Twenty nine per cent (63% women) claimed that coffee induced a desire to defecate. The rectosigmoid motor responses to black, unsweetened coffee were then investigated by multiport manometry in 14 healthy-subjects (12 men, two women, eight of whom claimed coffee caused a desire to defecate (responders). Results revealed an increase in motility index within four minutes after ingestion of both regular and decaffeinated coffee (p less than 0.05) in the eight responders, but not in the six non-responders. The increase in rectosigmoid motility induced by coffee lasted at least 30 minutes. There was no increase in the motility index in any subject after a drink of hot water. These results suggest that drinking coffee can stimulate a motor response of the distal colon in some normal people.\r"

A tracer dose of 15N15N-urea was placed in the caecum in six and distal to the splenic flexure in six. The urine and stool were collected for 72 hours and isotopic enrichment was measured in a mass spectrometer. A similar proportion of the dose was recovered in the urine as 15N15N-urea from the right colon, 6%, as was recovered from the left, 4%, showing that the urea was absorbed intact. Urinary 15N14N-urea from the right colon was 18% of the dose compared to 13% from the left colon. This represents urea that has been hydrolysed and absorbed as ammonia. Less than 4% of the dose was recovered in the stool. The greatest proportion of the label, 74% from the right and 82% from the left, could not be accounted for in the urine or the stool and is presumed to have entered the metabolic pool of nitrogen. We conclude that; the colon is permeable to urea, intraluminal hydrolysis occurs and that urea nitrogen enters the metabolic pool of nitrogen in functionally significant quantities.\r"

In the diarrhoea predominant group balloon volumes required to perceive the sensations of gas, stool, urgency of defecation and discomfort were significantly lower than in controls or constipation predominant patients (p less than 0.001). Diarrhoea predominant patients also had a significantly lower rectal compliance than controls or constipation predominant patients (p less than 0.03) but showed no difference in motor activity induced by distension. When the constipation predominant patients were compared with controls the only significant difference that emerged was in the volume at which discomfort was perceived. No significant differences between constipated subjects and controls were found in the distension induced motor activity. Symptom severity and psychological parameters were also recorded and the diarrhoea predominant patients were found to be more anxious than those with constipation (p = 0.04). It proved possible (by comparison with the control group) to identify three abnormal rectal subtypes in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. These were a sensitive rectum (low sensation thresholds, normal or low rectal pressure), a stiff rectum (normal or low sensation thresholds, high pressure) and an insensitive rectum (high sensation thresholds, normal or high pressure) and their distribution varied considerably depending on bowel habit. Some form of rectal abnormality was identified in 75% of diarrhoea predominant patients compared with 30% of constipation predominant subjects (p = 0.002). A sensitive rectum was a particular feature of diarrhoea predominant patients being observed in 57% of patients compared with only 7% of the constipated group (p less than 0.001).\r"

Significant abnormalities were detected in the majority of these patients. A striking diversity in metabolic patterns was observed. Patients with acute viral hepatitis had low liver phosphodiesters and high phosphomonoesters, possibly phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine. In alcoholic hepatitis phosphomonoesters were raised. Intracellular inorganic phosphate and inorganic phosphate/ATP ratios were decreased in primary biliary cirrhosis and in some patients with hepatitis. These spectroscopic results were evaluated in respect of the pattern of liver damage and cellular regeneration. Liver tumours had raised phosphomonoesters and also showed evidence for altered spin-lattice relaxation of the phosphorus nucleus in various metabolites. In iron overload the liver ATP resonances were broadened. The line broadening correlated with the degree of iron overload suggesting the potential use of P-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy for measuring liver iron.\r"

In this study, liver biopsies from 74 patients with ulcerative colitis have been reevaluated. None of the patients showed clinical or biochemical signs of liver disease at the time of biopsy. Thirty seven (50%) had a completely normal liver biopsy. The others showed minimal portal inflammation or fatty infiltration. The biopsies of three patients displayed concentric, periductular fibrosis, or so called 'onion skin' lesions. None showed other signs of fibrosis or cirrhosis. The histological findings were unrelated to either activity or extent of colitis, except for the onion skin lesions which were seen exclusively in biopsies of patients with involvement of the total colon. Sixty eight of the 74 patients were reviewed after a mean interval of 18 years. The majority had no symptoms of hepatobiliary disorders and only two had developed liver disease; one suffered from cryptogenic cirrhosis, possibly due to non-A, non-B hepatitis and the other of an autoimmune liver disease and later developed a bile duct carcinoma. Both were women with total colonic involvement. At the time of the first liver biopsy one showed no histological abnormalities and the other only minor fatty infiltration. Thus, minor abnormalities in liver tissue are common in patients with ulcerative colitis without biochemical evidence of liver disease. The morphological changes are of little help in predicting the future risk of a patient with ulcerative colitis developing a clinically relevant hepatobiliary complication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was no difference in pregnancy outcome when an oocyte which subsequently fertilized was obtained from the follicle.

The three known criteria used for recognition of the paternal pronucleus in rodent zygotes were investigated. These criteria are (a) the presence of sperm tail remnants, (b) an increased pronuclear diameter, and (c) the farthest distance from the second polar body. Sperm tail remnants were observed in only 3/342 (1%) of the pronuclei. Pronuclear diameters and positions of the largest pronuclei did not reveal any trends. Pronuclei of tripronucleate zygotes were frequently smaller than those of two-pronucleate ones. The parental origin of human pronuclei cannot be determined morphologically using standard light optics. Microsurgical removal of paternal pronuclei from polyspermic zygotes should therefore be implemented with caution.\r"

Three hundred thirty semen samples were used to inseminate 1462 oocytes. Conventional parameters of sperm concentration and percentage motility in the ejaculate as well as swim-up migration were analyzed in relation to fertilization rate. It was shown that the probability of fertilizing human oocytes in vitro decreases significantly when (a) the sperm concentration is below 20 x 10(6) spermatozoa/ml ejaculate (P = 0.006), (b) motility is lower than 80% (P = 0.002), or (c) less than 4 x 10(6) motile spermatozoa/ml are concentrated in the swim-up fraction (P less than 0.0001). It was also demonstrated that nonfertilizing sperm could not be distinguished from fertilizing sperm by the conventional criteria but rather by the average concentration of motile spermatozoa in the swim-up fraction [12.5 +/- 1.5 and 22.3 +/- 2.3 x 10(6)/ml for the 0 and the 100% fertilization groups, respectively (mean +/- SE; P less than 0.01)]. Thus, the swim-up migration technique can serve as a predictive test for the in vitro fertilizing capacity of sperm.\r"

In both groups the Medi-Cult Hybritest was used for routine quality testing. A significantly (P less than 0.05) increased rate of deliveries/ongoing pregnancies was observed with the Group 2 medium. However, no significant differences in fertilization rate, cleavage rate, or implantation rate were observed. It is concluded that the serum-free culture medium described and the testing for absence of cytotoxicity in a sensitive bioassay (Hybritest) have yielded culture conditions capable of sustaining the development in vitro of human preembryos without impairing the fertilization process or the implantation rate, ultimately resulting in a significantly increased rate of deliveries/ongoing pregnancies and an apparently decreased abortion rate. The potential harmful effects of serum and the need for blood sampling and preparation further increase the advantages of replacing serum with the synthetic serum replacement SSR 2 in an IVF program.\r"

  ".W": "Seven couples underwent combined electroejaculation and in vitro fertilization for anejaculatory infertility after a failed regimen of electroejaculation and intrauterine insemination. Two pregnancies resulted, one proceeding to a term vaginal delivery and one ending in a 6-week spontaneous abortion. Poor sperm binding and no fertilization were seen in two of the couples. Fertilization of the oocytes but no subsequent pregnancy were seen in the other three couples. Combined in vitro fertilization and gamete intrafallopian transfer was performed in four of the couples. The combination of electroejaculation and in vitro fertilization offers the opportunity to evaluate the female pelvis, observe the sperm-oocyte interaction, and achieve a pregnancy in couples with anejaculatory infertility.\r"

  ".U": "90250342\r", 
  ".W": "Some major drawbacks of a bicarbonate-buffered culture medium include the requirement of an elaborate incubator system able to maintain a 5% CO2 environment and the inability of the culture medium to maintain a physiological pH range (pH 7.3-7.4) in room air (0.03% CO2). This work resulted in the development of IVF culture media, BB (modified T6) and Hams-HEPES, which use HEPES-buffered systems not requiring the specialized CO2 environment to maintain a physiological pH range in room air. These media generate above-average cleavage rates in in vitro fertilized, superovulated B6CBAF1 mice ova. The effect of heparin and HEPES on cleavage was studied and neither had a significant effect at the concentrations used. Cleavage rates of nonfertilized ova (parthenogenic division) were 9 to 13%. There was no significant difference in parthenogenesis between any of the culture media and it appears to be a function of the strain of mice and the timing between human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection and ovum collection. These results emphasize the need to account for parthenogenesis when determining cleavage rates of in vitro fertilized mouse ova. Also, the results suggest that because of individual mouse differences in cleavage rates, it is important to use an adequate number of mice per group to determine an accurate, average cleavage rate.\r"
