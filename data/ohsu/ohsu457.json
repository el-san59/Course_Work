  ".W": "Percutaneous coronary excimer laser angioplasty was successfully performed in two patients. An 85 year old woman with a 99% stenosis in a vein graft to a posterior descending artery had the stenosis reduced to 30% with laser angioplasty. Subsequent balloon angioplasty reduced the stenosis further to 20%. A second patient, a man aged 50 years, had multiple previous balloon angioplasties and stent implantation with two subsequent percutaneous atherectomies. Laser angioplasty of the vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch reduced the first of three sequential lesions from 60% to 40%, the second lesion from 90% to none and the third from 60% to 20% without the need for balloon angioplasty. Both procedures were well tolerated without chest pain, burning, vascular perforation or thrombus formation. These cases demonstrate the feasibility of safely performing percutaneous coronary excimer laser angioplasty. Additional studies are indicated to determine the clinical role and potential benefits of this procedure in relation to established procedures and other experimental devices.\r"

Among others these subsets have been designated as suppressor/inducer or naive T cells (CD45RA+, CDw29-) and helper/inducer or memory T cells (CD45RA-, CDw29+). Current theories suggest that these CD4+ T-cell subsets either reflect sequential stages of maturation before and after activation (antigen contact) or represent distinct lineages. In this study, we systematically analyzed the participation of both suppressor/inducer (CD45RA+) and helper/inducer (CDw29+) T cells in the dermal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate of various CD4+ cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Although in peripheral blood both subsets are equally distributed, we present evidence that all CD4+ cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are of the helper/inducer T cell phenotype. These findings are of importance both for pathogenetic and clinical considerations: the presence of plasma cells in dermal infiltrates and the elevation of serum immunoglobulins in patients of mycosis fungoides may be the consequence of interleukin-4 secretion of the neoplastic CD4+ helper/inducer cells. The exclusive memory T cell phenotype of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas may be due to a general predominance of this subset in the skin, or be the consequence of cellular activation during malignant transformation.\r"

We have treated 47 clinical stage I or IE patients with aggressive lymphoma histologies (diffuse large-cell, diffuse mixed, diffuse immunoblastic, follicular large-cell, diffuse small-non-cleaved cell) with four monthly cycles of an eight-drug combination chemotherapy program consisting of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine), procarbazine, high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, and prednisone (Pro-MACE-MOPP) administered systemically followed by 40 Gy involved-field radiation therapy. Forty-five (96%) patients achieved a complete remission and no patient has relapsed with a median follow-up time of 42 months (range, 8 to 90). Both patients failing to achieve a complete remission died of lymphoma, and one patient died free of lymphoma 45 months after diagnosis during coronary artery bypass surgery unrelated to lymphoma or its treatment. Hospital admissions were necessary to manage complications on nine of 188 (5%) cycles of treatment. There were no treatment-related deaths. ProMACE-MOPP plus involved-field radiation therapy is safe and effective treatment for localized aggressive lymphoma.\r"

An index, based on the ratio of thallium uptake in the tumor versus the homologous contralateral brain, was calculated and compared with tumor histology. The index in 14 patients with low-grade malignant gliomas was 1.27 +/- 0.40 in contrast to an index of 2.40 +/- 0.61 in 11 patients with high-grade malignant gliomas (p less than 0.0005). Whether gliomas were of low- or high-grade malignancy could be predicted with 89% accuracy using a threshold of 1.5. Low-grade gliomas with an index higher than 1.5 acted biologically more like high-grade tumors, and no tumor histologically classified as being of high-grade malignancy had an index lower than 1.7. This technique could help to reduce unrecognized sampling errors during needle biopsies of brain tumors, particularly of high-grade lesions classified in error as low-grade tumors due to inadequate biopsy material.\r"

  ".W": "Several publications have discussed the estimation and physiologic significance of regional [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) rate constants and metabolic rates. Most of these studies analyzed dynamic data collected over 45-60 min; three rate constants (k1-k3) and blood volume (Vb) were estimated and the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRGlu) was subsequently derived using the measured blood glucose value and a regionally invariant value of the lumped constant (LC). The dephosphorylation rate constant (k4) was either neglected, or a fixed value was used in the estimation procedure to obtain the remaining parameters. To compare the rate constants obtained by different authors using different values of k4 is impossible without knowledge of the effect of selecting different fixed values of k4 (including zero) on the estimated rate constants and rCMRGlu. Based on our analysis of FDG/PET data from nine normal volunteer subjects, we conclude that inclusion of a fixed value for k4, in spite of a scaling effect on the absolute values of model parameters, has no effect on the coefficient of variation (CV) of within- and between-subject parameter estimates and glucose metabolic rates.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]acetate allows noninvasive regional quantification of myocardial oxidative metabolism. To assess the metabolic response of normal myocardium to increased work (oxidative metabolic reserve), clearance of myocardial 11C activity after administration of [11C]acetate i.v. was measured with PET in seven normal subjects at rest and during dobutamine infusion. At rest, clearance of 11C was monoexponential and homogeneous. The rate constant of the first phase of 11C clearance, k1, averaged 0.054 +/- 0.014 min-1 at a rate-pressure produce (RPP) of 7329 +/- 1445 mmHg X bpm. During dobutamine infusion, RPP increased by an average of 141% to 17,493 +/- 3582 mm Hg Z bpm. Clearance of 11C became biexponential and remained homogeneous. k1 averaged 0.198 +/- 0.043 min-1 with a mean coefficient of variation of 16%.. k1 and RPP correlated closely (r = 0.91; p less than 0.001), and the slope of the k1/RPP relation remained consistent in all subjects (1.48 +/- 0.42). These findings suggest that PET with [11C]acetate and dobutamine stress may provide a promising approach for evaluation of regional myocardial oxidative metabolic reserve in patients with cardiac diseases of diverse etiologies and for assessment of the efficacy of interventions designed to enhance the recovery of metabolically comprised myocardium.\r"

None of these patients have lost T cell capability; they have never had infections characteristic of T cell deficiency. Four patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of profound immunodeficiency. A decreased number of CD4+ cells (less than 400/microliters) and a decrease in phytohemagglutinin responsiveness (stimulation index less than 10) may be useful in discriminating patients with immunodeficiency; absolute lymphocyte count and immunoglobulin values were not informative. At the time of surgery, the thymus was not found in 11 of 14 patients; however, only two of these patients had immunodeficiency. Patients with a persistently low number of CD4+ cells and decreased phytohemagglutinin response are candidates for immunologic reconstitution.\r"

In contrast, in the seronegative arthritis patient group only SF mononuclear cells were hyporesponsive to mitogenic stimulation and there were no significant differences in IL-2 production or IL-2 receptor upregulation as compared with control subjects. No significant correlations were observed between IL-2 inhibitor levels and mitogenic responses, IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor upregulation on peripheral blood and SF mononuclear cells but an inverse correlation was noted between SF mitogenic responses and the expression of selected activation markers. We conclude that IL-2 abnormalities appear to be most pronounced in RA compared with other inflammatory arthritides and that these changes do not appear to be directly related to serum or SF IL-2 inhibitor levels.\r"

Our study was undertaken to analyze Tal+ cells in peripheral blood from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and examine the correlation between the proportion of Tal+ cells and disease activity. Using a dual immunofluorescent method, T cell subsets were analyzed in peripheral blood from 46 patients with RA, 10 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and 10 healthy subjects. Patients with RA had a significantly higher percentage of T cells bearing the Tal antigen than patients with OA and healthy subjects. Furthermore, the percentage of CD3+Tal+ cells in peripheral blood from patients with RA was significantly correlated with disease activity including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, morning stiffness and the Lansbury index, whereas CD3+ HLA-DR+ cells did not correlate. In serial observations in patients with RA, the percentage of CD3+ Tal+ cells decreased in accordance with the improvement of disease activity. Thus, we suggest that the percentage of Tal+ cells may be a marker of the disease activity in patients with RA.\r"

Without baseline tests of neuropsychological, neurobehavioral and neurophysiological testing it may be difficult to detect subtle changes in neurological function after lead exposure. This may be further confounded by partial chelation treatment and exposure to neurotoxic mixtures or inability to quantitate alcohol consumption. We undertook a cross-sectional study to address these problems in 24 exposed and 29 control subjects in a plant that manufactured electrical components using fritted leaded glass to coat capacitors and transistors. Potentially exposed workers had blood lead levels ranging between 3 micrograms/dL to 135 micrograms/dL. Industrial hygiene monitoring revealed the plant's air lead levels ranged from 61 micrograms/m3 to 1,700 micrograms/m3 in excess of OSHA permissible exposure limits of 40 micrograms/m3/10 hr day. Using a specially designed battery of neurophysiological, neurobehavioral and neuropsychological screening tests, we demonstrated a significant difference from controls in measures of psychomotor speed, motor strength and verbal memory. Although limited by the cross-sectional design, these findings support the hypothesis that the battery of neurophysiological, neuropsychological and neurobehavioral tests can detect a significant inter-group differences between lead-exposed and control subjects.\r"

In patients dialyzed with new hollow-fiber cuprophane dialyzers, predialytic (T0) monocyte-associated IL-1 activity was 12.5 +/- 3.0 U/ml (mean +/- SEM), a value that was higher than that found in normal individuals (2.85 +/- 0.85 U/ml; P less than 0.0025) and in non-dialyzed patients with chronic renal failure (0.95 +/- 0.85 U/ml, P less than 0.0001). Cell-associated IL-1 activity was consistently increased after five hours of dialysis with cuprophane membranes (42.4 +/- 5.5 U/ml, P less than 0.0005). Systemic complement activation was demonstrated by the finding of increased plasma levels of C3adesArg antigen during dialysis. In patients dialyzed with high permeability polyacrylonitrile and polysulfone membranes, no intradialytic change in cell-associated IL-1 and no complement activation occurred. However, the mean predialytic values of monocyte-associated IL-1 in these patients (that is, 32.9 +/- 5.6 U/ml and 38 +/- 5.65 U/ml for the polyacrylonitrile and the polysulfone groups, respectively) were higher than the predialytic levels of cell-associated IL-1 in the patients from the cuprophane group (P less than 0.0025). Monocytes obtained at the beginning and five hours of dialysis from patients dialyzed with polyacrylonitrile devices, and monocytes obtained at five hours but not at the beginning of dialysis from patients dialyzed with cuprophane membranes, spontaneously released extracellular IL-1 after 24 hours of culture in serum free conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Histologic cell types of these lung cancer tissues included squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 30), adenocarcinoma (n = 28), large-cell carcinoma (n = 4), and small-cell carcinoma (n = 6). Tissues of squamous-cell carcinoma exhibited exceptionally high 125I-EGF binding activity, and those of small-cell carcinoma showed no EGF binding activity. Southern blot hybridization analysis revealed EGF receptor gene amplification in the squamous-cell carcinomas with high EGF binding activity. The EGF receptor levels in squamous-cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas were compared with their pathological staging grouping and pathological findings, including degree of differentiation, diameter of tumor, and lymph node metastasis. However, unlike previous reports on breast and bladder cancers, there was no obvious correlation between these pathological characteristics and the EGF receptor levels of lung cancer.\r"

It was found that splenectomy enhanced the rate of tumor appearance and mean tumor diameter and disturbed the equation of T-lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood, i.e., a subnormal level of Th/Ts ratio. Interestingly, a significant correlation was noted between decreasing values of Th/Ts ratio and increasing average diameters of implanted tumor in splenectomized rats, but not in sham-splenectomized or nonoperated rats with tumor growth. In spleen cells from tumor-bearing rats, a distinct increase of B-lymphocytes and a decrease of T cells were demonstrated. Data from this investigation provide striking evidence that a relationship exists between enhancement of tumor growth and disproportion of T-lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood and offer some reasonable explanation for the causes of the promotive role of tumor growth following splenectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma levels of ventricular myosin fragments, determined with monoclonal antibodies to myosin heavy chains, were studied in 27 patients after cardiac operations (17 aorta-coronary bypass grafts and 10 valve replacements) to assess their possible role as a marker of perioperative myocardial necrosis. Five patients had perioperative myocardial necrosis after aorta-coronary bypass grafts as indicated by changes in the electrocardiogram and elevated levels of the MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase. Six more patients were also studied after thoracic operations performed by the same sternotomy approach. After cardiac operations, myosin levels increased from postoperative day 3 and reached peak values on day 7. Peak myosin values in patients with perioperative myocardial necrosis after aorta-coronary bypass grafting were significantly higher than in patients after an identical operation but without perioperative myocardial infarction (3793 +/- 592 versus 369 +/- 47 ng/ml; p less than 0.001). These results suggest that plasma myosin is a sensitive marker of myocardial necrosis. Furthermore, peak plasma levels of ventricular myosin after coronary bypass grafting without myocardial infarction (mean value 369 +/- 47 ng/ml) were not significantly different from peak levels after thoracic operations (mean value 253 +/- 52 ng/ml), whereas they were significantly higher after valve replacement (mean value 794 +/- 149 ng/ml; p less than 0.01). These results indicate that a certain degree of myocardial necrosis occurs during value replacement that is undetectable by the usual diagnostic criteria for perioperative myocardial infarction. We conclude that the plasma level of ventricular myosin fragments is a more specific and accurate marker of perioperative myocardial necrosis than changes in the electrocardiogram or elevated creatine kinase MB levels. Therefore the detection of myosin fragments, which appear in the serum on the third day after cardiac operations, may be useful for precise comparisons of different techniques of myocardial protection.\r"

The factors that were significantly correlated with preoperative hematocrit value, in order of their decreasing contribution to variability, were sex, date of operation, preoperative hospital stay, weight, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, age, smoking history, and recent myocardial infarction (less than 6 weeks). Factors that did not contribute significantly to predicting preoperative hematocrit value included ejection fraction, emergency operation, previous streptokinase use, number of coronary arteries diseased, body mass index (obesity), diabetes, height, body surface area, and history of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The patient most likely to have a low preoperative hematocrit value can be characterized as a small, elderly, female nonsmoker with a recent myocardial infarction and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The prevalence of low preoperative hematocrit value is increasing with time independent of other factors.\r"

This treatment was used for atheromatous lesions in 27 patients and for restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in 23; in 3 patients, it was repeated for recurrent stenosis (2) or a persistent intimal flap (1). Successful results, defined as a reduction of the stenosis by 40% or more in association with removal of tissue, absence of Q-wave infarction, and no need for a bypass surgical procedure during in-hospital follow-up, were achieved in 47 of the 53 procedures (89%). Atherectomy reduced the stenoses from a mean of 87% to 15%. Failures occurred in 6 of the 53 procedures (11%). Three of these patients subsequently underwent successful conventional balloon angioplasty, and three required surgical treatment. Six patients had minor complications--embolization of atheromatous material in two, intimal dissection in two, and side-branch occlusion and transient thrombosis in one each. Coronary atherectomy with use of this device promises to be a relatively safe and efficient treatment of coronary artery stenosis.\r"

The cold provocation was designed not to cause a pain reaction, and no rise in heart rate/blood pressure product occurred during provocation. Myocardial perfusion was assessed by measurement of thallium uptake by imaged single photon emission computed tomography. No patient had clinical evidence of cardiac involvement, but abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) findings were found in 5. In 12 patients cold-induced reversible perfusion defects were found; 9 of these also had permanent defects. A further 3 patients had permanent perfusion defects but no reversible defects. The permanent and/or reversible perfusion defects were not related to age among the patients and were not seen in any of the healthy controls, whose age distribution was similar. The reversible and permanent defects were not related to other features of systemic sclerosis, nor to the ECG findings. It is concluded that abnormalities in myocardial perfusion are common in systemic sclerosis and may be present without apparent clinical myocardial involvement. A cold-induced vasopastic process in the myocardial circulation might contribute to the development of the patchy myocardial fibrosis seen in patients with systemic sclerosis.\r"

We have produced 199 murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with the idiotypes isolated from 67 patients with follicular small-cleaved-cell lymphoma. These antiidiotype antibodies were analyzed for their ability to react with lymphoma cells from patients other than the one against which each antibody was made. Twenty of the 199 antiidiotype antibodies were reactive with lymphoma cells from more than one patient. Depending on the antibody, the frequency of idiotype sharing ranged from 0.6 to 6.2 percent of B-cell lymphoma tumors evaluated. Tumors could be grouped into distinct families on the basis of their reactivity with these antibodies. In the aggregate, the 20 antibodies reacted with a total of 49 of 150 B-cell lymphomas (33 percent), including 30 of 110 follicular small-cleaved-cell lymphomas (27 percent). Many of these shared idiotypes were expressed by more than one histopathological subtype of lymphoma. We conclude that a panel of antibodies reactive with shared idiotypes can be produced for patients with B-cell lymphoma, obviating the need to produce an antiidiotype antibody for each patient.\r"

We randomly assigned 101 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and bleeding esophageal varices to undergo either emergency sclerotherapy (n = 50) or staple transection of the esophagus (n = 51). Four patients assigned to sclerotherapy and 12 assigned to staple transection did not actually undergo those procedures, but all analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis. Total mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups; the relative risk of death for staple transection as compared with sclerotherapy was 0.88 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 1.54). Mortality at six weeks was 44 percent among those assigned to sclerotherapy and 35 percent among those assigned to staple transection. Complication rates were similar for the two groups. An interval of five days without bleeding was achieved in 88 percent of those assigned to staple transection and in 62 percent of those assigned to sclerotherapy after a single injection (P less than 0.01) and 82 percent after three injections. In only 2 of the 11 patients who received a third sclerotherapy injection was bleeding controlled for more than five days, and 9 died. We conclude that staple transection of the esophagus is as safe as sclerotherapy for the emergency treatment of bleeding esophageal varices and that it is more effective than a single sclerotherapy procedure. We currently recommend surgery after two injection treatments have failed.\r"

It is important, therefore, to characterize the stromal cells involved in presentation of antigen in the thymus. In a previous report, we demonstrated, using T-cell hybridomas, that three distinct types of antigen presenting cells in the thymus (cortical epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells) constitutively expressed self haemoglobin/Ia complexes. Here we report that one of these cell types, the cortical epithelial cell, does not induce stimulation of T-lymphocyte clones even though the antigen/Ia complex required for antigen-specific recognition is present. This lack of response occurs with both TH1 and TH2 clones. Responsiveness of the TH2 clone can be restored by adding the murine lymphokine interleukin-1 beta to the culture system.\r"

  ".W": "The influx of Ca2+ due to the transmembrane calcium current, ICa, has a fundamental role in cardiac pacemaker activity, in the action potential plateau and in excitation-contraction coupling. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic neurotransmitters can modulate ICa. Recent studies indicate that in both the cardiovascular and the central nervous systems, nerve varicosities exist that contain a novel non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic peptide--calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Although CGRP is known to exert strong positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, as well as to cause vasodilation, very little is known about the ionic mechanisms of these effects. Here we report that CGRP dramatically increases ICa in single heart cells. Although this CGRP-induced increase in ICa resembles the effect of beta-adrenergic agonists, our results demonstrate some significant differences between the effects of CGRP and these agonists: (1) the increase due to CGRP cannot be blocked by beta-adrenergic antagonists; (2) the CGRP-induced effect is transient; and, (3) CGRP can inhibit isoproterenol-stimulated ICa. Our results provide the first electrophysiological evidence that CGRP can significantly modulate ICa in the heart, and suggest a new additional mechanism for the neurogenic control of cardiac function.\r"

Three founder lines of transgenic mice containing the HTLV-1 tax gene under the control of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) have previously been shown to develop neurofibromas. Further analysis of these animals has now revealed that they also develop an exocrinopathy involving the salivary and lachrymal glands. This pathology resembles Sjogren's syndrome, a disease of presumed autoimmune aetiology, features of which are sometimes reported in HTLV-1 associated conditions. Mice with an HTLV-1 tax transgene might be a useful model for studying the development of Sjogren-syndrome-like pathology.\r"

Although there has been increasing information concerning the sequence requirements and the biochemical mechanisms involved in the constitutive splicing of primary RNA transcripts, very little is known about the sequences or mechanisms which determine alternative RNA-processing events in complex transcription units. The calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) primary RNA transcript undergoes tissue-specific alternative processing, resulting in the differential production of calcitonin mRNA in thyroid C cells and CGRP mRNA in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these alternative RNA processing events, we have examined the nucleotide sequences involved in the production of calcitonin and CGRP mRNAs. Analyses of HeLa and F9 cell lines transfected with a variety of mutant calcitonin/CGRP transcription units have demonstrated that alternative splice-site selection is primarily regulated by cis-active element(s) near the calcitonin-specific 3'-splice junction. We suggest that the tissue-specific pattern of alternative RNA processing is conferred by sequence information at the calcitonin-specific acceptor which serves to inhibit the production of calcitonin transcripts in CGRP-producing cells.\r"

Intravenous administration of rIL-2, with or without lymphokine-activated killer cells, produces a variety of serious side effects and approximately one-third of the patients experience a decrease in neurological status. Our previous investigations in animals have indicated that a single intravenous injection of rIL-2 can compromise the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The present study examined the histopathological effect and BBB changes in rats which occur after a single intracerebral injection of rIL-2, its excipient, or saline into the parietal lobe. Animals were killed at various intervals up to 8 days (1 hour after intravenous injection of horseradish peroxidase), and the brain tissue was sectioned and processed for light microscopy. All animals showed increased cerebrovascular permeability for horseradish peroxidase due to traumatic BBB disruption at 4, 12, and 24 hours after injection. Extravasation of horseradish peroxidase persisted at 3 and 8 days only in animals injected with rIL-2. Injections of rIL-2 led to an increased leukocytic infiltration into the injection site, perivascular cuffing, and localized edema by 24 hours, which continued to increase over the 8-day study period. These results suggest that a single injection of human rIL-2 into the brain of rats induces an influx of leukocytes into the brain and may contribute to the cellular events that perpetuate a trauma-induced compromise in the integrity of the BBB.\r"

Three of them had primary parenchymal CNS lymphoma, and 2 had epidural lymphoma that originated in adjacent bone marrow. Three patients were neurologically asymptomatic, but had leptomeningeal tumor and focal parenchymal infiltration at postmortem examination. Histologically, 4 lymphomas were large cell, 3 were mixed large and small cell, and 1 could not be classified by the working formulation for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The clinical and pathologic manifestations of T-cell lymphoma in the CNS may be diverse.

Between attacks, migraineurs had lower plasma 5-HT and higher 5-HIAA levels than did healthy controls and patients with tension headache. During migraine attacks, plasma 5-HT levels were substantially higher than during attack-free periods, while 5-HIAA concentrations and platelet enzyme activities were lower. Platelet 5-HT was reduced only during common, but not classic, migraine attacks. We hypothesize that systemic 5-HT metabolism is enhanced in migraineurs during headache-free periods and transiently decreases during attacks, presumably due to a fall in enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, platelet behavior differs during migraine attacks with and without aura, and release of platelet 5-HT cannot (exclusively) be held accountable for the rise of plasma 5-HT during migraine attacks.\r"

Cerebral glucose metabolism determined by 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) was unchanged in primary visual cortex of VS and NVS patients compared with 12 normal volunteers of similar age and sex. Glucose metabolism in VS patients was decreased by 45 and 34% in left and right visual association cortex (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively) and 34 and 37% in left and right inferior parietal cortex (P less than 0.05) compared with controls; NVS patients had no significant metabolic alteration in these areas.

A variety of management schemes were used in these patients, including the following: topical and intravenous antibiotics alone; intraocular and topical antibiotic administration; pars plana vitrectomy with capsulectomy and intraocular antibiotic administration; and removal of all capsular remnants with PC IOL removal or exchange. The final visual acuities ranged from 20/20 to 20/60 in six eyes and 20/200 to 20/400 in three eyes.

In 246 patients who had primary or secondary SS, we correlated the presence or absence of atrophic oral mucosal lesions with the patient's salivary function and other clinical features. The 91 patients (37%) who had these lesions were older, had a greater frequency of primary SS and of oral symptoms, had had oral symptoms for a longer period, had more salivary gland inflammation, and had lower stimulated parotid flow rates than the 155 patients without CAC (p less than 0.05). However, unstimulated whole salivary flow rates and denture status were not significantly different. Topical antifungal treatment, begun on 47 patients, eliminated lesions in some. The methods of treating CAC are discussed. Candida-associated oral mucosal lesions do not develop in all patients with SS, but in susceptible patients, SS leads to a reversible form of CAC that is not associated with dentures.\r"

We sought to document depression of antibody concentrations after immunization of 18-month-old infants with H. influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide-diphtheria conjugate vaccine. All 9 infants with detectable preimmunization anticapsular antibody had depression of antibody concentrations on the second day after immunization (P = 0.002). By Day 7 all had achieved anticapsular antibody concentrations greater than 0.15 micrograms/ml, a level believed to provide protection to immediate challenge with H. influenzae type b. Of those without detectable preimmunization antibody, 7 of 21 (33%; 95% confidence interval, 11 to 56%) had not achieved concentrations of greater than 0.15 mg/ml 1 week after immunization. We conclude that there is depression of anticapsular antibody concentrations during the first week after immunization with H. influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide-diphtheria conjugate vaccine. We speculate that H. influenzae type b infections after immunization with H. influenzae type b vaccines may be the result of: (1) low antibody concentrations because of either depression of antibody concentrations or failure to develop antibody; and (2) exposure to H. influenzae type b. Depression of antibody concentrations could be explained by binding of in vivo antibody to the vaccine.\r"

Because of concern that the occurrence of this potentially blinding disease is increasing, a retrospective chart review was undertaken to compare the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity at the University of Washington during the years 1981 to 1984 with previously published data collected at the same institution during the years 1968 to 1980. During 1981 to 1984, there was an increase in the annual numbers of admissions and survivors weighing 1750 g at birth; the survival rate increased significantly (P less than .000001). A trend toward an increased risk for proliferative retinopathy of prematurity (P = .057) during 1981 to 1984 period was noted, but the number of \"excess cases\" was calculated to be only 6 per year. The remainder of the additional cases, 19 annually, were due to increased survival of infants at risk. Thus, the \"second epidemic\" of retinopathy of prematurity is largely due to improved survival of low birth weight infants rather than to new iatrogenic factors. In infants with proliferative retinopathy of prematurity, there was a previously unreported association between increased severity of disease and lower birth weight (P = .015). There were four children with severe bilateral visual loss due to retinopathy of prematurity identified during the 1981 to 1984 period, whereas only one bilaterally blind infant was noted during the preceding 12.7 years.\r"

The age of onset of eating disorders remains unclear because there are no published surveys of voluntary dieting and eating attitudes in young children. A total of 318 girls and boys were surveyed from two randomly chosen schools in middle-income neighborhoods. The children were equally distributed among grades 3 through 6. The survey included a children's version of the Eating Attitudes Test and a demographic and dieting questionnaire. Results showed that 45% of the children wanted to be thinner, 37% had already tried to lose weight, and 6.9% scored in the anorexia nervosa range, closely matching the published results concerning teenagers and young adult women. Several questions were isolated by univariate and multiple regression analyses that accurately (P less than .05) predicted children's Eating Attitude Test scores. The fact that young children admit having diet preoccupation and atypical eating attitudes is shown in this study.

Ninety-eight patients with sickle cell disease (65 with SS phenotype, 23 with SC phenotype, and 10 with S beta-thalassemia) 1.5 to 20 years of age were given 25 micrograms of vaccine subcutaneously. The vaccine was well tolerated; mild side effects were observed in 6 of 98 (6.1%) children. In addition, one patient with a recent vasoocclusive crisis was hospitalized because of fever and vasoocclusive crisis 8 hours after vaccination. Prevaccination anticapsular antibody concentrations (by radioimmunoassay) were less than 0.15 microgram/mL in 7 of 11 children 18 to 24 months of age (geometric mean 0.17 microgram/mL), in 10 of 25 children 2 to 5 years of age (geometric mean 0.36 microgram/mL), and in 3 of 50 patients 6 to 20 years of age (geometric mean 1.03 microgram/mL).

The incidence of frequent all-night cosleeping was found to be 21%, significantly higher than the documented rate of 6% found in a representative sample of white middle-American urban children of the same age and sex. For occasional cosleeping, however, there were no significant ethnic differences, and frequent part-night cosleeping was significantly less common than noted in the white sample. There were greater ethnic differences for sharing the parental bedroom compared with cosleeping in the parental bed, approximately 80% for Hispanic-Americans vs 10% for the white population. Within the Hispanic-American group, frequent all-night cosleeping was significantly more common among single parents and those living in multiple households and less common among infants and later-born children in the family. Frequent all-night cosleeping was also significantly associated with sleep problems.\r"

  ".W": "Few data currently exist concerning the sleep problems of preadolescents. A parent report questionnaire concerning sleep habits and problems was developed. The questionnaires were completed by the parents of 1000 unscreened elementary school children attending the third, fourth, and fifth grades. The schools were randomly selected from an urban area. Of the 1000 questionnaires, 972 were completed and could be used for statistical analysis. Among the parents, 24% reported sleeping poorly and 12% regularly relied on sedatives to induce sleep. Sleep difficulties lasting more than 6 months were present in 43% of the children. In 14% (132 of 972), sleep latency was longer than 30 minutes, and more than one complete arousal occurred during the night at least two nights per week. The following variables were seen among the poor sleepers: lower parental educational and professional status, parents who were more likely to be divorced or separated, and more noise or light in the rooms were they slept. They also presented a higher incidence of somnambulism, somniloquia, and night fears (nightmares and night terrors) than the children who slept well. Boys who slept poorly were significantly more likely to have insomniac fathers (P less than .010). Regular use of sedatives was described in 4% (5 of 132) of the children who slept poorly. Among the \"poor sleepers,\" 21% (33 of 132) had failed 1 or more years at school. School achievement difficulties were encountered significantly more often among the poor sleepers than among the children without sleep problems (P = .001). Of the families with children suffering from sleep problems, 28% expressed a desire for counseling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This investigation focused on substance use among children who regularly care for themselves after school (latchkey children). The data, collected from 4932 eighth-grade students, indicated that self-care is an important risk factor for alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. Data collected from 2185 parents validated these findings. Eighth-grade students, who took care of themselves for 11 or more hours a week, were at twice the risk of substance use as those who did not take care of themselves at all. This relationship held at all levels of sociodemographic status, extracurricular activities, sources of social influence, and stress. Of the 186 stratified tests of the relationship, 90% were significant; even those not found to be significant were in the direction expected. Path analyses suggest that risk-taking, having friends who smoke, and being offered cigarettes may partially explain the relationship between self-care and substance use. Those eighth-grade students who select friends who smoke and place themselves in situations in which they are offered cigarettes may be manifesting a desire to display their sense of maturity and independence. The fact that the increase in substance use occurred among almost all strata tested and the fact that mediation was not complete suggest that more than one mechanism may account for the associated increase in substance use. It is also possible that more time in self-care results in more unnoticed solitary trials of substances, as well as trials motivated by peer offers or peer pressure to use substances.\r"

This 60-kilobase gene complex, which lies within the major histocompatibility complex on the short arm of human chromosome 6, has been studied in considerable detail because genetic disorders in steroid 21-hydroxylation and in C4 are common. We have cloned a cDNA encoded by a previously unidentified gene in this region. This gene lies on the strand of DNA opposite from the strand containing the P450c21 and C4 genes, and it overlaps the last exon of P450c21. The newly identified gene encodes mRNAs of 3.5 and 1.8 kilobases that are expressed in the adrenal and in a Leydig cell tumor but are not expressed in nonsteroidogenic tissues. The sequence of the longest cDNA (2.7 kilobases) shows no similarity to known sequences available in two computerized data bases. The 5' end of this sequence is characterized by three repeats, each encoding about 100 amino acids flanked by potential sites for proteolytic cleavage. Although numerous studies have shown that gene deletions causing congenital adrenal hyperplasia occur in this region, none of these gene deletions extends into this newly identified gene, suggesting that it encodes an essential function.\r"

  ".W": "A transcriptional enhancer element has been identified 4.5 kilobases 3' of C alpha (constant region alpha chain) in the human T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha-chain locus. This enhancer is active on both a TCR V alpha (variable region alpha chain) promoter and the minimal simian virus 40 promotor in TCR alpha/beta Jurkat and EL4 cells but is inactive on a V alpha promoter in human TCR gamma/delta PEER and Molt-13 cells, clone 13 B cells, and HeLa fibroblasts. The enhancer has been localized to a 116-base-pair BstXI/Dra I restriction enzyme fragment, which lacks immunoglobulin octamer and kappa B enhancer motifs but does contain a consensus cAMP-response element (CRE). DNase I footprint analyses demonstrated that the minimal enhancer contains two binding sites for Jurkat nuclear proteins. One of these sites corresponds to the CRE, while the other does not correspond to a known transcriptional enhancer motif. These data support a model in which TCR alpha gene transcription is regulated by a unique set of cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors, which are differentially active in cells of the TCR alpha/beta lineage. In addition, the TCR alpha enhancer may play a role in activating oncogene expression in T-lymphoblastoid tumors that have previously been shown to display chromosomal translocations into the human TCR alpha locus.\r"

This system serves as a model for T-cell-independent type 2 antigens such as haptenated Ficoll, dextran, and bacterial polysaccharides, which can also stimulate B-cell proliferation and antibody production at low concentrations. We show here that conjugated anti-immunoglobulin, at concentrations that stimulate significant increases in expression of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and incorporation of thymidine into DNA, does not induce detectable modulation of surface immunoglobulin. These results indicate that the facilitated T-cell-independent B-cell activation by polysaccharide antigens may result from inability to modulate surface immunoglobulin, possibly resulting in persistent and/or repetitive signaling. Early large increases in Ca2+ and breakdown of inositol phospholipids presently thought to be involved in transduction of the mitogenic signal are not detectable at low concentrations of conjugated anti-immunoglobulin, raising the possibility that these biochemical events may not in fact be central to this signaling pathway.\r"

This model would predict that, in oligomeric proteins, T cells prepared with specificity for regions that are buried within subunit association surfaces should recognize the respective regions in vitro equally well on the isolated subunit or on the oligomer. Three hemoglobin (Hb) alpha-chain synthetic peptides, corresponding to areas that are situated either completely [alpha-(31-45)] or partially [alpha-(41-45) and alpha-(81-95)] within the interface between the alpha and beta subunits of Hb, and a fourth peptide representing a completely exposed area in tetrameric Hb were used as immunogens in SJL/J (H-2s) mice. Peptide-primed T cells were passaged in vitro with the respective peptide to obtain peptide-specific T-lymphocyte lines. T-cell clones were isolated from these lines by limiting dilution. T-cell lines and clones that were specific for buried regions in the subunit association surfaces recognized the free peptide and the isolated subunit but not the Hb tetramer. On the other hand, T cells with specificity against regions that are not involved in subunit interaction and are completely exposed in the tetramer recognized the peptide, the isolated subunit, and the oligomeric protein equally well. The responses of the T-cell lines and clones were major histocompatibility complex-restricted. Since the same x-irradiated antigen-presenting cells were employed, the results could not be attributed to differences or defects in Hb processing. The findings indicate that in vitro the native (unprocessed and undissociated) oligomeric protein was the trigger of major histocompatibility complex-restricted T-cell responses.\r"

  ".W": "Reversible congestive heart failure can accompany cardiac allograft rejection and inflammatory myocarditis, conditions associated with an immune cell infiltrate of the myocardium. To determine whether immune cell secretory products alter cardiac muscle metabolism without cytotoxicity, we cultured cardiac myocytes in the presence of culture supernatants from activated immune cells. We observed that these culture supernatants inhibit beta-adrenergic agonist-mediated increases in cultured cardiac myocyte contractility and intracellular cAMP accumulation. The myocyte contractile response to increased extracellular Ca2+ concentration is unaltered by prior exposure to these culture supernatants, as is the increase in myocyte intracellular cAMP concentration in response to stimulation with forskolin, a direct adenyl cyclase activator. Inhibition occurs in the absence of alteration in beta-adrenergic receptor density or ligand binding affinity. Suppressive activity is attributable to the macrophage-derived cytokines interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor. Thus, these observations describe a role for defined cytokines in regulating the hormonal responsiveness and function of contractile cells. The effects of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor on intracellular cAMP accumulation may be a model for immune modulation of other cellular functions dependent upon cyclic nucleotide metabolism. The uncoupling of agonist-occupied receptors from adenyl cyclase suggests that beta-receptor or guanine nucleotide binding protein function is altered by the direct or indirect action of cytokines on cardiac muscle cells.\r"

PET-derived measurements of average surface metabolism were encoded as colors and mapped onto the 3D model by means of a retrospective technique for registering the two scans. The integrated 3D model depicted the location of PET-detected metabolic abnormalities with respect to the gyral anatomy visualized with MR. In each case, the predicted relationships were confirmed intraoperatively by means of inspection of the brain and electroencephalography. Multimodality 3D displays are likely to be particularly valuable for interpreting PET studies of epileptic patients and others with normal MR anatomy.\r"

Lateral radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine were quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated to determine whether DISH, spondylosis deformans, or a normal spine was present. Statistical analysis was performed for evaluation of interobserver reliability, the relationship between pelvic and spinal abnormalities, and the significance and predictive values of pelvic abnormalities for DISH versus non-DISH and DISH versus spondylosis deformans. Although significantly higher frequencies and greater extents of radiographic abnormalities at 10 of 14 pelvic locations were noted for DISH compared with non-DISH, this number decreased to four of 14 locations when compared with spondylosis deformans. The alterations in three of these four pelvic sites consisted of ossification of ligaments. These changes appear to be good indicators of the presence of spinal DISH and support the concept that DISH is an entity separate from spondylosis deformans.\r"

  ".W": "CD4 is a cell surface glycoprotein that is thought to interact with nonpolymorphic determinants of class II major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules. CD4 is also the receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), binding with high affinity to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120. Homolog-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify CD4 regions that are important in class II MHC binding and to determine whether the gp120 and class II MHC binding sites of CD4 are related. Class II MHC binding was abolished by mutations in each of the first three immunoglobulin-like domains of CD4. The gp120 binding could be abolished without affecting class II MHC binding and vice versa, although at least one mutation examined reduced both functions significantly. These findings indicate that, while there may be overlap between the gp120 and class II MHC binding sites of CD4, these sites are distinct and can be separated. Thus it should be possible to design CD4 analogs that can block HIV infectivity but intrinsically lack the ability to affect the normal immune response by binding to class II MHC molecules.\r"

The relative number of V beta 11-positive cells in adult lymph nodes was ten times as high in B6AF1 mice thymectomized 1 to 4 days after birth as in normal mice. Moreover, for the first 10 days of life of B6AF1 mice, mature V beta 11-positive T cells were readily detected in the thymus and spleen. Thus neonatal thymectomy results in the maintenance of the receptor repertoire of early postnatal life, and this correlates with the subsequent development of organ-specific autoimmune diseases.\r"

In situ hybridization and nuclease protection analyses demonstrate that limbic seizures dramatically increase the amount of messenger RNA for NGF in the neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus within 1 hour of seizure onset and in broadly distributed neocortical and olfactory forebrain neurons some hours later. The increased messenger RNA species is indistinguishable from messenger RNA for transcript B of the beta subunit of NGF from mouse submandibular gland. Thus, the expression of a known growth factor is affected by unusual physiological activity, suggesting one route through which trophic interactions between neurons in adult brain can be modified.\r"

In 12 of 12 families carrying this trait, alterations are observed in the red and green visual pigment gene cluster. The alterations fall into two classes. One class arose from the wild type by a two-step pathway consisting of unequal homologous recombination and point mutation. The second class arose by nonhomologous deletion of genomic DNA adjacent to the red and green pigment gene cluster. These deletions define a 579-base pair region that is located 4 kilobases upstream of the red pigment gene and 43 kilobases upstream of the nearest green pigment gene; this 579-base pair region is essential for the activity of both pigment genes.\r"

A major antigen of tubercle bacilli of 65 kilodaltons is a heat shock protein that has significant sequence similarity and cross-reactivity with antigens of various other microbes. Monoclonal antibodies against this common bacterial heat shock protein were used to identify a molecule of similar size in murine macrophages. Macrophages subjected to various stress stimuli including interferon-gamma activation and viral infection were recognized by class I-restricted CD8 T cells raised against the bacterial heat shock protein. These data suggest that heat shock proteins are processed in stressed host cells and that epitopes shared by heat shock proteins of bacterial and host origin are presented in the context of class I molecules.\r"

The final immunoconjugates possess potent cytotoxicity and specificity in preclinical studies. In a phase I clinical study, N-AcMEL-MoAb conjugates were administered via the hepatic artery to 10 patients, nine of whom had disseminated colorectal cancer (including the liver) and one of whom had Dukes' C colon cancer that had been resected. The selection of MoAb was based on the immunoperoxidase staining of the primary colon cancer tissue. Thus far doses of 1000 mg/m2 MoAb conjugated to 20 mg/m2 of N-AcMEL have been administered with no significant side effects, whereas MEL unconjugated to monoclonal antibodies would have caused myelosuppression in a proportion of patients at the same dosage. Serum antimouse antibody responses were noted in all of the patients; febrile reactions were noted with higher doses but were easily controlled with antipyretics, antihistamines and, if necessary, steroids. Serum sickness developed in one patient who was given a second course of treatment in the presence of human antimouse antibody, but the episode was self-limiting. Eight of the 10 patients had evaluable disease. Subjective improvement was noted in almost all of the patients examined, and 33%, or 3 of 9, of the treatments (nine courses of treatment in eight patients with evaluable disease; one of the patients had two courses of treatment) led to antitumor responses (minor response) by objective assessment with computed tomography of the liver. It is important to note that treatment with N-AcMEL-MoAb conjugates was safe at a dose of 20 mg/m2 of N-AcMEL, whereas the efficacy of such a form of treatment remains to be determined.\r"

Cytomegalovirus was identified three times by lavage and once by transbronchial biopsy. Neither method detected Kaposi's sarcoma in the one patient shown to have it by open lung biopsy. The complication rate in a concurrent study of bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy in 74 consecutive HIV positive patients was 22%. This study does not support the use of transbronchial biopsy in these patients.\r"

At presentation 49 patients (group 1) were thought to have a history, findings at clinical examination, chest radiograph, and arterial blood gas tensions typical of pneumocystis pneumonia, and empirical treatment was begun immediately. Twenty four patients (group 2) were thought to have features not typical of pneumocystis pneumonia. All patients were subsequently referred for bronchoscopy to determine the diagnosis. In group 1 four patients were excluded from the analysis because bronchoscopy was not possible. Of the remaining 45, 42 had pneumocystis pneumonia, which was diagnosed at bronchoscopy in 40, and on the basis of the clinical response to co-trimoxazole in two who had negative results from investigations. Of the three patients without pneumocystis pneumonia, one patient with lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis and Branhamella catarrhalis infection would have failed to respond to empirical treatment. The other two had multiple bacterial pathogens at bronchoscopy; one already had Kaposi's sarcoma and the other would have been misdiagnosed as having AIDS. In group 2 a specific diagnosis was made at bronchoscopy in 21 cases, including pneumocystis pneumonia in seven (all had atypical chest radiographs). In three cases no diagnosis was made and spontaneous recovery occurred. Adopting an empirical approach to treatment for typical pneumocystis pneumonia (group 1) led to the correct treatment in 43 of 45 cases (95%) and would have saved 44 of the 45 of bronchoscopies in this group. Adopting an empirical approach would have caused one patient to be misdiagnosed as having AIDS. Overall, 44 out of 69 bronchoscopies (64%) would have been saved; the specificity for the diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia was 85% and the sensitivity was 85%. Adopting an \"empirical\" treatment policy for typical pneumocystis pneumonia will cause a large reduction in the number of \"high risk\" bronchoscopies performed.\r"

Fourteen patients (group 1) received pentamidine isethionate 4 mg/kg (six patients) or 8 mg/kg (eight patients) via a standard jet nebuliser (Acorn, system 22) with a flow rate of 8 l/min. The aerosol droplets had a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 2.6 microns (geometric standard deviation (GSD) 2.9) and 46% of droplets were less than 3.9 microns. A further 16 patients (group 2) received 8 mg/kg pentamidine via a jet nebuliser with baffles to limit droplet size to below 4 microns (Respirgard II). This generated aerosol droplets with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.8 micron (GSD 1.5) and 98% were less than 3.9 microns. Only three of the 14 patients in group 1 responded clinically to treatment, one after the lower dose of pentamidine. Treatment was discontinued in 10 patients and one patient died at bronchoscopy from haemorrhage. Thirteen of the 16 patients in group 2 responded. Side effects occurred infrequently; two patients from group 1 had a cough, six patients (four from group 2) had contact bleeding at bronchoscopy, and two further patients had haemoptysis. The differing response rate may be due to differences in the mean droplet size of the aerosols produced by the nebulisers. Nebulised pentamidine (8 mg/kg) when delivered by Respirgard II nebuliser appears to be as effective as conventional treatment for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia of mild to moderate severity.\r"

These patients were similar in age and sex to other patients with pain, and the frequency of pain as a primary complaint was similar for myofascial pain as compared with other reasons for pain. The usual intensity of myofascial pain as assessed by a visual analog scale was high, comparable to or possibly greater than pain due to other causes. Patients with upper body pain were more likely to have myofascial pain than patients with pain located elsewhere. Physicians rarely recognized the myofascial pain syndrome. Commonly applied therapies for myofascial pain provided substantial abrupt reduction in pain intensity. The prevalence and severity of myofascial pain in this university internal medicine setting suggest that regional myofascial pain may be an important cause of pain complaints in the practice of general internal medicine.\r"

We studied 31 subjects, 10 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 12 with remote myocardial infarction, and nine controls. Rb-82 images were compared with Tl-201 and regional wall motion for detection of infarct-related arteries. Of the 22 patients with myocardial infarction, 16 were identified with Rb-82 and Tl-201. In nine control subjects, eight were normal with each method. Correlation between Rb-82 and Tl-201 defect scores was excellent. Sensitivity and specificity for infarct-related arteries were similar for Rb-82, Tl-201, and wall motion imaging.

Mean weight change during 10 d of hospitalization was a loss of less than 1%. Follow-up median weight-for-height percentiles increased after admission (p less than 0.01). Percentile values were as follows: admission, 45th; 1 mo, 60th; 3 mo, 60th; and 6 mo, 68th. Forty-three percent of the cases were greater than 75th percentile of weight-for-height at 6 mo after disease. An additional follow-up assessment of weight-for-height indicated that 43% of a representative sample subset of 49 were still obese 1.17-5.5 y after disease. Significant differences in median concentrations of serum prealbumin were found between days 1 (128 mg/L) and 5 (199 mg/L, p less than 0.0001) and days 5 and 10 (214 mg/L, p less than 0.02). Median erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficients increased between days 1 (1.16) and 5 (1.20, p less than 0.01). The mean free erythrocyte protoporphyrin-heme ratio increased between days 5 (10.78 X 10(-6)) and 10 (14.22 X 10(-6), p less than 0.01). We conclude that there were transient adverse changes in nutritional status. Obesity appears to occur after disease.\r"

All the major clinical forms were represented, including single lesions and monosystemic and multisystemic disease. In all the cases, a variable fraction (3-35%) of LCH cells was immunoreactive with KP1 and anti-Mac; the staining pattern was quite typical because the immunoreaction product was often confined to the perinuclear space and the Golgi area. LCH cells containing lysozyme and AACT were detected less frequently; however, in positive cases the percentage of LCH cells immunoreactive for lysozyme and AACT was in the same range as that of KP1-positive cells. On immunostained cytosmears (one case), about 10% of the CD1a-positive cell population was reactive for the macrophage antigens CD14 and PAM-1. No association was noted between the number of KP1-positive cells and the clinical form and/or anatomic site of the lesion. Phagocytic macrophages were significantly and diffusely immunoreactive with KP1 and anti-Mac and for AACT and lysozyme. Multinucleated giant cells with irregular nuclei were frequently observed; these cells were rarely S-100 positive, were consistently stained by KP1 and AACT, and were occasionally anti-Mac positive. The authors' findings suggest that antimacrophage monoclonals, in conjunction with S-100 protein, may represent a useful tool to establish the diagnosis of LCH in paraffin-embedded material.\r"

Because of a polyclonal kappa/lambda pattern of the B-lymphocytes, the possibility of a B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was excluded. The initially morphologically benign lymphocytic skin infiltrates (1985) changed into a pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma (1987). Southern blot analysis of the atypical skin infiltrates and of the original material of the parotid gland and submandibular lymph node revealed identical clonal rearrangements of the T-cell receptor B-chain.

I show here a method of gauging the ascertainment levels of surveyed data in a geometric continuum. The method is valid for recessive segregation at any ascertainment level and in simplex or multiplex sibships of whatever degree of truncation. Four previously published surveys are used to show conformation with real data and the existence of detection trends spanning the range from the unsuspected very depressed bias level to the inflated level above single ascertainment.\r"

The inheritance pattern appeared to be autosomal dominant. Results of various color vision tests indicated preferential involvement of the short-wavelength sensitive cone system, with relative preservation of the middle- and long-wavelength sensitive cone systems. Both anomaloscope testing with larger (8-degree) fields and short-wavelength sensitive electroretinography indicated some short-wavelength sensitive cone system involvement beyond the central macula in the three affected individuals on whom testing was performed. The condition appeared to be a familial macular dystrophy with preferential short-wavelength sensitive cone involvement. The abnormal macular findings and mild reduction in visual acuity distinguish this condition from congenital tritanopia; the normal optic disks distinguish it from autosomal dominant optic atrophy.\r"

The nature and duration of tissue fixation and processing are critical in the detection of the two cell types. In tissue that is lightly fixed, LN-1 recognizes astrocytes. The astrocytic nature of the LN-1 reactive glial cell was confirmed by cytologic features, tissue distribution, immunoelectron microscopy, double labeling immunofluorescent microscopy, and staining of serial sections with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein. In tissue that is fixed for longer periods or in Bouin's fixative, two glial cell types are recognized: astrocytes and microglia. The identity of the latter cell type as microglia was confirmed by morphologic features, tissue distribution, immunoelectron microscopy, and double staining with monoclonal antibodies or lectins to macrophage markers, including class II major histocompatibility antigens. The two cell types had different disposition in senile plaques of elderly individuals and of those with Alzheimer's disease. Astrocytes were present at the periphery of the plaques, whereas microglial cells were centrally placed, often in juxtaposition to amyloid. The results are discussed with respect to ontogeny of glial cells and the ability of monoclonal antibodies to recognize epitopes on unrelated proteins.\r"

The role of protein synthesis in neutrophil emigration into acute inflammatory lesions was examined. Local intradermal injections of actinomycin D, cycloheximide or puromycin could inhibit in a dose- and time-dependent manner neutrophil emigration induced by interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha or endotoxin, but not by the leukocyte chemoattractants C5a des arg (zymosan-activated plasma), n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or leukotriene B4. Maximal inhibition, measured at the time of peak emigration, was greater than 90%. The onset of neutrophil emigration induced by the cytokines or by endotoxin was delayed by 30 to 60 minutes in comparison to the leukocyte chemoattractants. These results demonstrate at least two mechanisms of neutrophil emigration: one with a slower onset and dependence on local RNA transcription and translation and the other rapid in onset and independent of protein synthesis.\r"

Previously, the expression of IL-1 in H-RS cells in tissue sections was shown by using immunoperoxidase staining. For further confirmation, the production of IL-1 in cultured cells of the H-RS cell lines HDLM-1, HDLM-1d, and KM-H2 was examined by using a murine D10.G4.1 T cell proliferation bioassay and Northern blot hybridization with specific IL-1 cDNA probes. It was confirmed that two types of H-RS cells, HDLM-1 and KM-H2, can secrete IL-1, especially after treatment with phorbol ester. The amounts of IL-1 in H-RS cell culture medium ranged from approximately 0.5 to 2.5 ng/ml. The major IL-1 secreted by HDLM-1 cells was IL-1 alpha, and by KM-H2 cells was IL-1 beta. HDLM-1d cells did not produce IL-1. This finding indicates the heterogeneity of IL-1 production in H-RS cells. Such heterogeneity may apply to H-RS cells in vivo, based on the variable IL-1 staining of these cells in lymphoid tissues.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional seroprevalence study using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. Risk-factor data were gathered by administered questionnaire and chart review. SETTING: Two urban, primary care clinics for persons with sexually transmitted diseases run by the Jamaican Ministry of Health. PATIENTS: Of the 2050 consecutive patients presenting with new episodes of sexually transmitted disease, 1977 patients were eligible for analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Overall HTLV-I seroprevalence was 5.7%; prevalence increased with age from 1.6% (age, 14 to 19 years) to 5.1% (age, 30 years and older) in men and from 5.3% (age, 14 to 19 years) to 14.1% (age, 30 years and older) in women. Compared with a reference cohort of food service employees, age-adjusted HTLV-I seroprevalence was increased in female patients with sexually transmitted disease (odds ratio = 1.83; CI, 1.41 to 2.83) but not in male patients with sexually transmitted disease. Independent risk factors for HTLV-I infection in women included having had more than ten lifetime sexual partners (odds ratio = 3.52, CI, 1.28 to 9.69) and a current diagnosis of syphilis (odds ratio = 2.12; CI, 1.12 to 3.99). In men, a history of penile sores or ulcers (odds ratio = 2.13; CI, 1.05 to 4.33) and a current diagnosis of syphilis (odds ratio = 3.56; CI, 1.24 to 10.22) were independent risk factors for HTLV-I infection. Of 1977 patients, 5 (0.3%) had antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), including 2 with HTLV-I and HIV-1 coinfection. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that HTLV-I is transmitted from infected men to women during sexual intercourse. Our data are consistent with the lower efficiency of female-to-male sexual transmission of HTLV-I, but penile ulcers or concurrent syphilis may increase a man's risk of infection.\r"

When compared with values obtained in normal volunteers, mean cerebral glucose metabolism was slightly reduced in subjects with striatonigral degeneration who, in addition, had a marked (20.5%, +/- 3 SD) relative hypometabolism in putaminal and caudate nuclei. Significant hypometabolism was also found in motor/premotor as well as in prefrontal cortex. In 2 subjects who were studied twice a deterioration of relative striatal metabolism paralleled clinical evolution. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed the presence of abnormal iron deposits in the putamen in all cases but showed no cortical anomalies. These results suggest that positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose may provide an index of cell and processes degeneration in the striatum in striatonigral degeneration and is able to detect functional deficits in frontal cortex. The presence of striatal hypometabolism might be a predictor of a poor response to L-dopa.\r"

The percentage of CD4+ DR+ cells and CD8+ DR+ cells, both of which are phenotypically activated T cells, and the ratio of CD4+ DR+ cells to CD4+ cells and of CD8+ DR+ cells to CD8+ cells are also increased in the patients, compared with the control subjects. The percentage of CD4+ 4B4+ cells showed positive correlations with values of spontaneous proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and serum IgG level in patients with the myelopathy.\r"

  ".W": "The aims of distal splenorenal shunt with splenopancreatic disconnection (DSRS-SPD) were to improve maintenance of portal flow and prevent siphoning of hepatotrophic factors from the pancreas, as occurs after standard DSRS. The main patient population targeted for improvement were alcoholic cirrhotics, who have poorer survival than nonalcoholic cirrhotics and greater loss of portal flow (60%) after standard DSRS. Seventy-eight patients had DSRS-SPD during the study period 1983 to 1987: thirty-two patients were Child's A, 25 were Child's B, and 21 were Child's C. The 35 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were a significantly poorer risk group by Child's class and galactose elimination capacity (GEC) than the 39 patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis. Four patients had portal vein thrombosis. At 4-year follow-up, portal perfusion is maintained in 84% alcoholic and 90% nonalcoholic patients, with hepatic and systemic hemodynamics showing identical patterns for both groups. Hepatic function measured by GEC was maintained in alcoholic patients (290 +/- 68 mg/min to 303 +/- 74 mg/min) and nonalcoholics patients (342 +/- 92 to 320 +/- 118 mg/min). Gastric variceal rebleeding occurred in 10 patients--4 early (less than 2 months) and 6 late (18 to 54 months), leading to operation in 4 and transhepatic embolization in 4 patients: 2 of these patients died from this complication. Survival data show an operative mortality rate of 6.4% and overall mortality rate of 30%, with no significant difference between alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhotics. DSRS-SPD has significantly improved maintenance of portal perfusion and survival in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis requiring selective shunt for variceal bleeding when compared to standard DSRS. In this population DSRS-SPD is the operation of choice. In patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis, the current data have not shown DSRS-SPD to have advantage over standard DSRS.\r"

Surgical preparation led to a significant decline in endothelium-derived relaxing factor release as compared with freshly isolated vein, and these changes were associated with loss of endothelial coverage. Storage of freshly isolated vein in blood but not in Hartmann's solution also resulted in a decline in maximally stimulated endothelium-derived relaxing factor release that was not associated with loss of endothelium. Reduced production of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet adhesion and aggregation, may be implicated in the etiology of early vein graft thrombosis.\r"

The method for selecting the sample unit was random-digit dialing. We found that 92% of the survey subjects noticed seasonal changes of mood and behavior to varying degrees. For 27% of the sample seasonal changes were a problem and 4.3% to 10% of subjects, depending on the case-finding definition, rated a degree of seasonal impairment equivalent to that of patients with seasonal affective disorder. The seasonal pattern of \"feeling worst\" exhibited a bimodal distribution with a greater winter and a substantially lower summer peak (ratio, 4.5:1). Younger women who have a problem with seasonal changes and who feel worse on short days tended to exhibit the highest seasonality scores. It is apparent from our study that seasonal affective disorder represents the extreme end of the spectrum of seasonality that affects a large percentage of the general population. The influence of environmental factors on mood disorders and mood changes in the general population might provide valuable insight into pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of affective illness.\r"

Eight cases (3 P, 5 S) occurred in immunocompromised patients. Age at presentation in immunocompromised patients was typically younger than in the nonimmunocompromised patients. Presenting complaints of central nervous system involvement included headache, seizures, personality changes, memory lapses, ataxia, cranial nerve symptoms, and impaired consciousness. Cerebrospinal fluid involvement was seen only in 3 S cases. In 8 of the P cases, the diagnosis was first established at autopsy; in 6 of the S cases, central nervous system involvement was first documented at autopsy. Survival was longer in treated patients than in those who received no therapy (5 months in P cases and 9.3 months in S cases; 2.3 months without therapy). Regardless of therapy, the average survival of immunocompromised patients was 2.4 months. The majority of cases were multifocal. Of the P cases, 1 was of low histologic grade, 9 were of intermediate grade, and 1 was of high grade. Of the S cases, 5 were of low grade, 9 were of intermediate grade, and 1 was of high grade. Immunophenotypic studies were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue with antisera against common leukocyte antigen (all reactive), B-cell markers (L26, MB2, LN1, and LN2), T-cell markers (UCHL1 and MT1), Leu-M1, Leu-7, and HLA-DR (LN3). Two S cases were of T-cell phenotype; all others were of B-cell derivation. Eleven cases were HLA-DR positive (all of B-cell phenotype). One T-cell lymphoma was reactive for Leu-7. All cases were nonreactive for Leu-M1. All cases in immunosuppressed patients and all P cases were of B-cell phenotype.\r"

In all instances these changes were associated with generalized and/or cerebral infection by these same agents. Neither Kaposi's sarcoma nor malignant lymphoma was encountered in the pituitary glands. Acute necrotic foci, presumably due to infarction, were noted in four cases. Four pituitary microadenomas (8%) and four hyperplastic nodules were identified. The incidence of such noninfectious lesions, as well as the prevalence and distribution of the various immunoreactive adenohypophysial cell types, were similar to those seen in the pituitary glands of age-matched male control patients.\r"

Assessment of cerebral metabolism using positron emission tomography and cerebral blood flow with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) reveals focal physiologic deficits in structurally normal areas. Using both SPECT and NP assessment with the Halstead-Reitan Battery, we evaluated 50 patients with partial seizures. Comparison of the location of visually identified regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) deficits in these patients with the location of the NP deficits revealed a significant correlation. Additional analyses indicated that rCBF quantification in visually identified areas of hypoperfusion was significantly lower than in \"normal\" areas and that quantified NP variables significantly discriminated patients with and without visual rCBF deficits in temporal and frontal brain regions.\r"

Considered to be an immune complex-mediated disorder, HUVS has been differentiated from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), based on its clinical manifestations and the C1q precipitin (C1q-p) reaction, which is manifested as gel precipitation of C1q by a small percentage of HUVS IgG molecules. This phenomenon has been attributed to an Fc region abnormality, and the responsible IgG molecules are said to possess C1q-p activity. We purified IgG from 4 HUVS patients and confirmed that HUVS IgG contains C1q binding activity. F(ab')2 fragments from these patients also bound to C1q, as measured by 2 different C1q binding methods at physiologic ionic strength; HUVS IgG Fc fragments did not bind to C1q. Preincubation of HUVS F(ab')2 fragments with antibody to human F(ab')2 prevented subsequent binding to C1q. We conclude that IgG antibodies to C1q are present in HUVS serum, and it is likely that these antibodies are C1q-p. Because the clinical manifestations of HUVS and the presence of anti-C1q antibodies have been described in patients with SLE, our findings support the concept that HUVS is an autoimmune syndrome related to SLE.\r"

HLA-Bw60 (or B40 when the Bw60,61 split of B40 was not typed for) was shown to be increased among B27+ AS patients in each of 5 independent data sets. This increase was statistically significant in 4 of the 5 data sets studied, and the overall significance was P less than 0.00001. Susceptibility to AS in B27+ individuals was further increased by a factor of approximately 3 when Bw60 was also present. The distribution of HLA-A alleles on the B27-bearing haplotypes in AS patients was not significantly different from that in normal controls. On the other hand, the distribution of HLA-A alleles on Bw60-bearing haplotypes was significantly different from the distribution of A alleles on Bw60 haplotypes in the general population (P less than 0.0005). Bw60 was not increased in B27- patients with AS. A dominant mode of inheritance generally fits AS; however, our sib pair analysis indicates that the B27,Bw60 disease subgroup follows a more recessive mode of inheritance.\r"

  ".W": "The role of complement in the pathogenesis of demyelination and inflammation has been investigated in a synergistic model of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the Lewis rat. Depletion of serum complement with cobra venom factor (CVF) suppressed the clinical expression of acute inflammatory EAE induced either by immunization with 50 micrograms guinea pig basic protein (MBP) in Freund's complete adjuvant, or by the passive transfer of 10(7), but not 5 X 10(7) MBP activated spleen cells. Despite the suppression of clinical disease in actively induced EAE, treatment with CFF only had a significant effect on the severity of CNS inflammation in early disease (12 days postimmunization) when the number of inflammatory foci was reduced by 35%. Three days later this difference had resolved and no significant difference could be detected in the severity of CNS inflammation, although control animals exhibited severe disease, the CVF treated group being clinically normal. Demyelination in these models is initiated by systemic injection of the antimyelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) monoclonal antibody, 8-18C5, which in vitro lyses oligodendrocytes in a dose, Fc and complement-dependent manner and in vivo induces extensive CNS demyelination in rats with EAE. Treatment with CVF reduced the ability of this antibody to initiate demyelination in vivo and furthermore, its F(ab)2' fragment had no effect on the clinical course of EAE and was unable to initiate demyelination in normal animals. Complement-dependent mechanisms are therefore involved both in the clinical expression of acute inflammatory lesions and in the pathogenesis of antibody-mediated demyelination in EAE.\r"

  ".W": "Using position emission tomography (PET) and equilibrium imaging with oxygen-15 labelled gases, the cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood volume (CBV), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and oxygen consumption rate (CMRO2) were measured in multiple regions of interest over the cerebral cortex of 5 control subjects, 4 patients with strictly unilateral longstanding carotid artery occlusion, 1 patient with middle cerebral artery embolic stroke in the acute stage, and 4 patients with subcortical stroke and no cervical arterial disease. In each control subject, the regional CBV was linearly and positively correlated with both CBF and CMRO2, while the local mean transit time (t = CBV/CBF) was uniformly distributed, reflecting the local adaptation of both the vascular tone and the capillary density to the metabolic demand at constant cerebral perfusion pressure that characterizes the normal brain. In patients with subcortical stroke, cortical blood volume was reduced in proportion to the matched reduction in CBF and CMRO2, suggesting that the metabolic depression resulting from cortical deafferentation increases the resting tone of pial vessels. Unilateral carotid occlusion induced larger CBV and t, and steeper slopes of the CBV-CBF relationship, particularly on the occluded but also on the patent side. The assessment of the local cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) as judged by the ratio CBF/CBV in 3 patients with focally raised OEF and preserved or reduced CMRO2, allowed the demonstration in multiple cerebral regions of single patients of two well-known physiological phenomena: the autoregulation of CBF, followed by the rise of the OEF as local CPP falls further. In addition, the depression of CMRO2 in the ischaemic cortex was associated with a trend for CBV to return towards normal values, compared with the maximally elevated CBV found in oligaemic but metabolically normal areas. This suggests that a process of metabolic vasoconstriction may participate, among other factors, in the vascular collapse that occurs, and would serve to regenerate some haemodynamic reserve, at very low CPP levels.\r"

The intensity of this inflammatory response may be gauged by measuring the levels of both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and an inhibitor of interleukin-2 (IL-2-IN) activity in the urine during the hours after a BCG instillation. The levels of urinary IL-2 and IL-2-IN in the sixth week of BCG therapy predicted the subsequent clinical course in a group of 25 patients (P less than 0.01). Measurement of urinary IL-2 and IL-2-IN activity may be used to identify accurately those patients likely to develop a tumor recurrence, thereby sparing them the risk associated with inadequately treated bladder cancer. Since IL-2 and IL-2-IN are competitive with respect to biologic activity, and since relatively high urinary levels of either IL-2 or IL-2-IN activity correlated with a favorable clinical course, the authors conclude that the presence of bioactive IL-2 in urine is not required for the prevention of recurrent superficial bladder cancer.\r"

Skin lesions involved the scalp, head and neck, trunk, and buttocks and were small cleaved cell type in four cases, large cell type in three cases, and mixed type in four cases. The follicular pattern with a bottom-heavy distribution was identified in only six of the 11 cases. One case showed a nodular, perivascular pattern in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Four cases were characterized by a diffuse pattern of lymphocytic infiltrate. One patient with a diffuse pattern had an isolated subepidermal band of lymphoma cells representing primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous involvement by lymphoma previously diagnosed as low-grade (follicular growth pattern) transformed to higher grade disease in five of ten asynchronous cases. The 5-year survival rate was 60% among the transformed cases and 100% among the nontransformed cases. Extranodal cutaneous involvement in follicular lymphoma occurred in 3.8% of cases. The correct histologic diagnosis in a skin biopsy specimen can be established in cases with a follicular pattern (60%) with conventional histologic criteria such as redundancy of follicles, uniformity of follicular center cell composition, lack of interspersed phagocytic histiocytes, and absence of immunosecretory cellular elements such as plasma cells and immunoblasts.\r"

Wives perceived fewer long-term problems than husbands and were extremely supportive throughout their husbands' illnesses. At interview, whereas 23.5% of patients still felt less attractive as a result of treatment, no spouses shared this perception. Patients were more likely to report decreased, and wives increased sexual satisfaction compared to before cancer. However, both patients and spouses were more likely to report decreased frequency of intercourse than increased. In other areas as well, concordance was generally high. Few couples reported that infertility would pose a problem, but 53% were parents; men who banked sperm were less likely to already have children.\r"

Purified human secretory IgA and IgG exposed to 2-ME retained the molecular integrity and functional activity of the untreated antibody molecules. CM aliquots collected after high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation were assessed for antisperm antibody activity; antisperm antibody activity was retained in the appropriate IgA or IgG CM fractions. The incidence of CM antisperm antibodies was minimally affected when the radiolabeled antiglobulin assay was performed with a motile sperm population. Approximately 70% of the CM IgA antisperm antibodies were of the IgA1 subclass; CM IgG was primarily of the IgG4 subclass. When Candida antigen was substituted for sperm in the radiolabeled antiglobulin assay, the CM antisperm antibodies were found to be exclusively sperm-specific. These data indicate that the radiolabeled antiglobulin assay using 2-ME to extract CM antibodies is a specific method for the assay of antisperm antibodies in CM.\r"

A significant reduction in motility was observed at 48 hours after washing for caffeine. The percentage of hamster oocytes penetrated at 24 hours after washing was significantly reduced for caffeine, 2-deoxyadenosine, and pentoxifylline combined with 2-deoxyadenosine. Pentoxifylline-treated sperm showed no reduction in fertilizing capacity.

Compared with placebo, 900 mg of aspirin b.i.d. taken for 48 h caused significant endoscopic injury (median grade 3.5, interquartile range 2-4, modified Lanza scale, p less than 0.01), with an increase in mucosal bleeding from 2.0 (geometric mean; 95% confidence limits, 1.1-3.9) microliters/12 min, to 8.3 (2.4-28.8) microliters/12 min (p less than 0.05). Famotidine (20 mg b.i.d.) raised intragastric pH and reduced endoscopic antral injury (median 1.5, interquartile range 0.5-2, p less than 0.05) and bleeding [3.1 (1.2-8.3) microliters/12 min, p less than 0.01] to levels not significantly different from placebo [1 (0-1) and 2.0 (1.1-3.9) microliters/12 min, respectively]. By contrast, 2 mg of famotidine b.i.d. had no significant effect on intragastric pH endoscopic injury or bleeding rates. The two assessments of gastric mucosal injury correlated strongly (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01). The reduction in bleeding with famotidine tended to be higher, the greater the intragastric pH (r = 0.66, p = 0.057). Ultrathin endoscopy is a simple technique that validates gastric mucosal bleeding as a measure of acute gastric mucosal injury in humans. Acid suppression is an effective method of ameliorating this injury.\r"

We studied 21 probands with sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda and 135 of their relatives by determining HLA haplotypes and measuring transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration. Liver biopsies were performed in all probands and in relatives when appropriate. Seventeen pedigrees were available and were studied by both likelihood analysis and by a gene counting method. We estimated that 10 of the 17 probands with available living relatives possessed at least one hemochromatosis allele. Thirteen of the 21 probands (62%) possessed at least one HLA-A3 alloantigen. Eighteen of 69 relatives who shared an HLA haplotype with a proband (26%) had an elevation of transferrin saturation or serum ferritin concentration. Only one first-degree relative not sharing an HLA haplotype with a proband had an elevated transferrin saturation or serum ferritin concentration. These findings indicate that HLA-linked hemochromatosis alleles are far more common in patients with sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda than in individuals in the general population and may be responsible for the hepatic siderosis associated with most cases of sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda.\r"

The proportion of CD4+ T cells expressing the Leu-8 and CD45R antigens was normal in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The capacity of CD4+, Leu-8- T cells to provide helper function for pokeweed mitogen-stimulated immunoglobulin synthesis by B cells in vitro was similar in patients and controls. However, in contrast to normal individuals and patients with other liver diseases, CD4+, Leu-8+ T cells from six of 10 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis did not suppress, but enhanced immunoglobulin synthesis. Whereas treatment of CD4+ T cells from normal individuals with anti-Leu-8 monoclonal antibody enhanced their suppressor function, similar treatment of CD4+ T cells from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis did not increase their suppressor function. To determine whether the abnormal regulatory function of CD4+, Leu-8+ T cells was due to a defect of cell activation, the proliferative response of CD4+ T cell subpopulations to mitogenic stimulation was examined. The proliferative responses of CD4+, Leu-8- T cells from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and controls were similar, but the proliferative responses of CD4+, Leu-8+ T cells from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were lower than those of control cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Preoperative total ejection fraction averaged 30.5 +/- 1.5% (mean +/- SEM), contractile segment ejection fraction was 42.5 +/- 1.1% and end-diastolic volume of aneurysm was 81.4 +/- 10.4 ml. Seventy eight percent of patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting concomitantly with aneurysmectomy. Mean follow-up after operation was 41.5 +/- 3.5 months. Hospital mortality was 8.2%, the 5 year survival rate was 70 +/- 7% and the 5 year complication free rate was 52 +/- 8%. Mean functional class of dyspnea improved significantly from 2.9 +/- 0.1 preoperatively to 1.6 +/- 0.1 at late follow-up (p less than 0.001). Likewise, isotopic ejection fraction at rest increased from 13.7 +/- 1.3% preoperatively to 30.9 +/- 3.0% postoperatively (p less than 0.0001). Logistic regression analysis isolated two factors which influenced postoperative survival independently: contractile segment ejection fraction (p = 0.045) and myocardial score of left anterior descending coronary artery (p = 0.035). Combining these two risk factors, it was possible to identify a low risk group of patients with a 5 year survival probability of 93 +/- 6%, contrasting with a high risk group of patients having a 5 year survival of 57 +/- 9% (p less than 0.02). Thus, resection of left ventricular aneurysms complicated by congestive heart failure provides improvement in left ventricular function and clinical status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1980 and December 1986, 2573 patients underwent simple first time coronary artery bypass grafting, of whom 73 (65 males and 8 females) aged 34-69 years (mean 51.3 yrs) had repeat bypass grafts at Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester. Of these 73 patients, 15 had a previous myocardial infarction, 5 hyperlipidaemia, 4 systemic hypertension, and 12 had a strong family history of ischemic heart disease. There was an overall deterioration of left ventricular function at the time of reoperation. The interval between the two operations was 5-131 months (mean 34.2 mths); recurrence of angina occurred earlier (mean 18.4 mths). Vessels grafted at the first operation were LAD (59), RCA (46), circumflex (41) and diagonal (13). The corresponding data at reoperation were LAD (55), RCA (46), circumflex (28) and diagonal (10). Blocked grafts were seen in 67 patients and new lesions noticed in 29. Reoperation was done using saphenous vein (129), internal mammary artery (5), arm veins (2) and tubular Gortex grafts (2). One patient had concurrent excision of a left ventricular aneurysm. Coronary anastomoses were performed with elective ventricular fibrillation (47) or cardioplegic arrest (91). Aortic cross clamp time varied from 0-92 minutes. Seven patients required intra-aortic balloon support. These patients died in the first 30 days, an operative mortality rate of 4.1%, and two 18 months after surgery. Sixty-eight percent of patients seen at 1 year were totally symptom free. We conclude that reoperation for coronary artery disease can be done with a low mortality and good immediate relief of symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We report our experience with our first 19 consecutive patients, all with exceptionally severe disease in whom the coronary sinus route was utilized for cardioplegia infusion. Eleven had unstable angina, and three had persistent chest pain requiring intensive antianginal therapy right up to time of surgery. Blood cardioplegia was infused via the coronary sinus using a Foley Catheter under a monitored pressure of 30 mmHg. Ischemic time was 83 +/- 27 minutes. Number of vessels bypassed was 4.9 +/- 0.9. Prebypass hemodynamic profile was compared to the profile at 15 and 75 minutes, and at 6, 12 and 24 hours after cessation of bypass, and revealed good preservation of myocardial function: Cardiac index, stroke volume index and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure remained unchanged, systemic vascular resistance decreased by 30%, while changes of lesser magnitude were observed in systemic and pulmonary blood pressure. There was no death and one perioperative myocardial infarction. Myocardial temperature was monitored by needle thermisters and demonstrated homogeneous myocardial cooling in spite of the severity of CAD. Thus, preservation of cardiac function even in patients with critical and extensive CAD can be achieved by coronary sinus infusion of cardioplegia.\r"

The administration of cardioplegic solution induced immediate ventricular and atrial arrest in all patients. No recurrence of ventricular activity was observed while right atrial activity subsequently recurred in 11 patients. Activity at the surface ECG was recorded only in one patient with right atrial reactivation. No right atrial electrical activity was found below 19 degrees C. The average atrial temperature was 21.5 degrees C while the average apex temperature was 15 degrees C. The study has confirmed previous observations that during cardioplegic cardiac arrest the right atrium is not as well protected as the ventricular tissue against rewarming. Monitoring of the right atrial electrical activity or right atrial temperature is essential to ensure atrial arrest during the entire period of cardioplegic cardiac arrest.\r"

  ".W": "While several workers have identified epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors on human thyroid membranes, very few reports have described EGF effects on intact human thyroid cells in primary culture, and these were short term studies indicating that EGF effects were primarily inhibitory [reduced iodide uptake and thyroglobulin (Tg), T4, and T3 release]. Paradoxically, in vivo EGF stimulates thyroid growth and increases colloid stores. In this study we examined the effects of EGF on cultured thyroid cells in regard to thymidine incorporation, Tg secretion, and cAMP production during a 12-day period. Addition of EGF (0-30 ng/mL) to medium for 6 or 12 days stimulated thymidine incorporation and enhanced Tg synthesis by thyroid cells. However, the profile of Tg release into medium was biphasic. Tg release was inhibited by EGF (0.1-10 ng/mL) during the first 3 days of culture, but the inhibitory effect disappeared by the sixth day, and EGF stimulated Tg release by day 12 and thereafter. EGF enhanced endogenous cAMP levels in thyroid cells, but did not augment TSH-stimulated increases in cAMP production. Our observations of EGF-stimulated growth and inhibited Tg secretion during short term culture are consistent with the findings of earlier studies with nonhuman thyrocytes. However, the later phase of enhanced cAMP levels with stimulation of Tg secretion indicates that EGF may have trophic effects on thyrocytes previously unrecognized because of the short term nature of the studies. These observations suggest an important role for EGF in maintenance of normal thyroid physiology.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the phenotype and function of thyroid tumor-, metastatic lymph node-, and peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes of four patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Both phenotypic analysis of freshly isolated cells and clonal analysis, using a high efficiency cloning technique, were performed. For comparison, intrathyroid and peripheral blood T lymphocytes derived from patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases (Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis) have been studied. In papillary cancer, the phenotype of thyroid and lymph node-derived T lymphocytes did not differ from that of peripheral blood lymphocytes of the same patients or lymphocytes from normal peripheral blood. At variance with respect to autoimmune thyroid disease, activation markers were poorly represented. The functional analysis of T cell clones showed similar proportions of interleukin-2-producing (helper-inducer) clones in thyroid, lymph node, and peripheral blood, slightly lower than in Hashimoto's thyroiditis and slightly higher than in Graves' disease. With regard to effector function, we found lower proportion of clones with cytolytic activity in a lectin-dependent assay compared to that in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Interestingly, however, the proportions of cytolytic clones displaying cytolytic activity against the neoplastic cell line K562 (natural killer-like activity) or fresh unrelated tumor cells (lymphokine-activated killer activity) were relatively high in thyroid cancer infiltrates.\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine the involvement of T-B cell contact vs lymphokine production in mediating B cell cycle entry and progression, Th cell clones \"defective\" in lymphokine production were cloned. Th-3.1 is one such clone that required IL-2 to produce significant levels of IL-4 and IFN-gamma. Unlike conventional Th clones, Th-3.1 induced B cell proliferation only in the presence of Ag and IL-2. In contrast to the absolute requirement of IL-2 for Th-3.1-induced B cell proliferation, IL-2 was not required for the formation of stable Th-3.1-B cell conjugates or Th-3.1-induced B cell entry into the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In the absence of IL-2 and under conditions that promoted Th-B cell interactions, Th-3.1 induced 10 to 20% of resting B cells to enter G1. B cell entry into the cell cycle was not inhibited by anti-lymphokine mAb or promoted by exogenous lymphokines, suggesting that endogenous lymphokine activity was not required for Th-3.1-induced G0 to G1 transition. The data suggested that the IL-2-independent induction of B cells into G1 by Th-3.1 was a cell contact-dependent event. Direct proof that Th-3.1-B cell contact was necessary for B cell cycle entry was provided by comparative in situ analysis of the RNA synthetic activity and the RNA content of B cells that were in physical contact with Th-3.1 or not in contact with Th-3.1. In situ autoradiography of RNA synthesis illustrated that a high frequency of B cells in contact with Th-3.1 expressed heightened RNA synthetic activity, whereas \"bystander\" B cells were less frequently induced into cycle. In situ laser cytometry of B cell size and total RNA content showed that B cells in physical contact with Th-3.1 had a higher RNA content and were larger than \"bystander\" B cells present in the same microcultures. This model system has allowed the dissection of T cell help into IL-2-dependent and IL-2-independent phases. Early cell contact-dependent events and B cell cycle progression into G1 were IL-2 independent, whereas the production of lymphokines (IL-4, IFN-gamma) by Th-3.1 and Th-3.1-induced B cell proliferation was IL-2 dependent.\r"

Preculture of B cells with 0.01 to 1.0 micrograms/ml of polymerized C3dg (pC3dg) caused a dose-dependent enhancement of proliferation and accelerated entry into S phase after addition of anti-IgM. The continued presence of pC3dg during stimulation by anti-IgM was not required. pC3dg alone did not induce proliferation and preculture of B cells with C3dg monomer had no effect on the subsequent response to anti-IgM. The priming effect of pC3dg required at least 6 h and was greatest after 24 h of preculture. Preincubation with pC3dg did not lower the concentration of anti-IgM necessary for induction of proliferation, but did enhance proliferation at all concentrations above this threshold. Augmented proliferation occurred only in B cells of higher density in Percoll gradients, and neither T cells nor monocytes were required. Thus, independent interaction of CR2 with its natural ligand primes the B cell for subsequent stimulation through the Ag receptor, an effect that might synergize with the previously described CR2 function of lowering the threshold for B cell activation when crosslinked to membrane IgM.\r"

  ".W": "The endocytosis of Ag mediated by membrane-associated Ig (mIg) molecules has been spectrophotometrically monitored using a cell line (2C3) specific for the hapten phthalate (Xmp) and employing conjugates of Xmp and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as the labeled ligand. Approximately 50% of both Xmp-HRP, or the larger ligand, Xmp-keyhole limpet hemocyanin-HRP, are internalized rapidly, reaching an initial plateau by 30 min. The rate of endocytosis of anti-idiotype-HRP is similar to the rates that were observed for the hapten-bearing ligands, while a slower rate of endocytosis of anti-Ig-HRP was observed. The percent of ligand bound that is internalized and the rate of endocytosis appear to be largely independent of the size and amount of ligand bound per cell. However, mIg-mediated endocytosis is markedly reduced when mIg-ligand complexes are more extensively cross-linked by the binding of a second antibody. In addition to the initial rapid phase of endocytosis, there is a prolonged phase during which more of the bound ligand is internalized, and up to 90% of the internalized ligand is degraded. Re-expression of Ag-binding receptors by the 2C3 cells is independent of new protein synthesis and is accomplished in part by the translocation of a presynthesized pool of mIg molecules from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane of the cell. The kinetics of endocytosis of HRP-labeled anti-Ig antibodies by BALB/c splenic B-lymphocytes and other B-lymphocyte cell lines is very similar to the endocytosis of Ag and anti-idiotype observed with the 2C3 cell line. Light and electron microscopy are also performed to visually confirm that the HRP-labeled ligands are being internalized and to determine the percentage of cells involved in this process. Finally it was determined that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the mIg molecules are required for endocytosis since the secreted form of the molecule (which lacks these domains) fails to mediate the internalization of bound ligand.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms regulating the appearance of sIgE+ B lymphocytes appear to be lacking in adult germfree (GF) rats in that their Peyer's patches (PP) contain high numbers of cells with sIgE (approximately 15% of total cells), one-half of which simultaneously express sIgA, whereas sIgE+ cells are absent from PP of conventional rats (less than 1%). GF rat PP also contain elevated numbers of sIgA+ cells and decreased numbers of sIgM+ cells, with elevated numbers of sThy-1+ RT 7.1+ Ig- T cells, and reduced numbers of sThy-1- RT 7.1+ Ig- T cells. The cellular composition of PP of GF rats was converted to that resembling a conventional rat within 18 h after either 1) use of standard (unautoclaved) food; 2) feeding with certain bacteria (Clostridium difficile, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), in either live or heat-killed, but not autoclaved form; or with certain bacterial cell wall components: murein (peptidoglycan), and its synthetic derivatives, muramyltripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine and desmethyl-muramyldipeptide, but not with LPS, core lipid A or lipoprotein; there was no effect if any bacterial cell wall component was injected i.v.; or 3) thymectomy. Each procedure resulted in elimination of sIgE+ B cells and normalization of the other surface isotypes, and loss of sThy-1+ RT 7.1+ Ig- T cells and normalization of sThy-1- RT 7.1+ Ig- T cells. Irrespective of treatment, no sIgE+ cells were detected in bone marrow, thymus, other lymphoid organs or blood, excluding the possibility that the elimination of these cells from PP was associated with their redistribution to other sites. Thus, exposure to gut flora and bacterial peptidoglycan components may have resulted in IgE isotype switching, either directly or through the mediation of accessory and/or sThy-1+ RT 7.1+ regulatory T cells. The sites in which sIgE+ B cells are down-regulated appear to be PP.\r"

CD4, as well as CD8 expressing splenic T cells were induced to proliferate by the Th2 clones and mitogen, but mAb specific for CD4 or CD8 failed to affect the response. These findings indicate that cloned Th2 cells functioned as accessory cells and induced naive T cells to proliferate in the presence of mitogen.\r"

This selection process is thought to involve interactions between Ag-specific thymocyte receptors and self Ag presented by the MHC proteins on accessory cells, resulting in deletion of potentially harmful self-reactive precursors. However, the mechanisms underlying this clonal deletion have not been identified. In confirmation of previous findings (C. A. Smith, G. T. Williams, R. Kingston, E. J. Jenkins, and J. J. T. Owen, 1989. Antibodies to CD3/T-cell receptor complex induce death by apoptosis in immature T cells in thymic cultures. Nature 337:181), we have found that an anti-CD3 antibody stimulated DNA fragmentation, characteristic of a suicide mechanism known as apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD), in suspensions of human thymocytes. Endonuclease activation and cell killing were dependent on an early, sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, most of which was of extracellular origin. Although the magnitude and duration of the Ca2+ increase were similar to those observed in response to Con A, the mitogen did not stimulate DNA fragmentation or cell death. Phorbol ester prevented Ca2+-dependent DNA fragmentation and cell killing in response to anti-CD3 or other agents that stimulated PCD, suggesting that activation of protein kinase C abrogated cell suicide. Disappearance of CD4+CD8+ immature thymocytes was generally observed in response to all agents that stimulated PCD, whereas mature PBL were insensitive to stimulation of PCD. Our results suggest that antibody-mediated stimulation of immature thymocytes via the TCR complex results in Ca2+-dependent, endonuclease-mediated cell killing, depending on the activation status of protein kinase C.\r"

  ".W": "Human peripheral blood T cells were stimulated to proliferate when cultured with submitogenic doses of PMA and goat antibodies to 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT). The degree of proliferation, as measured by [3H]TdR incorporation on day 3, was similar to that achieved by stimulation with PHA. Anti-5'-NT antibodies had no effect on PHA-induced proliferation. Maximal stimulation was achieved with 0.6 to 1.0 ng/ml of PMA and 125 micrograms/ml of IgG isolated from a goat anti-5'-NT antiserum. Both intact IgG and F(ab')2 fragments were stimulatory. IL-2R expression and IL-2 secretion were also induced by anti-5'-NT antibodies and PMA. Anti-5'-NT-induced proliferation was inhibited greater than 95% by a murine anti-IL-2 receptor mAb and required less than 0.3% monocytes. Similar results have been obtained with a murine mAb specific for 5'-NT. As expected, anti-5'-NT antibodies and PMA did not induce the proliferation of ecto-5'-NT-T cells isolated by cell sorting. Pretreatment of total T cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C removed an average of 89% of the 5'-NT activity from the cell surface and also inhibited by 83% the ability of the cells to proliferate in response to anti-5'-NT antibodies and PMA. Thus, the activation signal provided by anti-5'-NT antibodies is apparently transduced, in large part, by a form of the enzyme that is attached to the membrane via glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. These data suggest that 5'-NT may play a role in lymphocyte activation as has been proposed for other glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored lymphocyte surface proteins.\r"

We investigated this stability in a clinical condition of so called nonmalignant monoclonal B cell proliferation, mixed cryoglobulinemia. The idiotypic profile of a single IgM kappa monoclonal auto-antibody with anti-IgG activity (rheumatoid factor (RF] which originated from a patient suffering from a nonmalignant mixed cryoglobulinemia was followed over a period of 3 yr. As judged from the reactivity of a panel of five different mouse monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies mapping the RF variable regions, there was no idiotypic change in the serum IgM RF. At a cellular level, in vitro stimulation of the patient's PBL gives rise to IgM kappa auto-antibodies that were shown to bear the same idiotypic determinants as the serum IgM kappa. We then investigated the effects of the anti-idiotypic antibodies on the in vitro IgM kappa production. When stimulated with PWM and in the presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies (10 micrograms/ml), the patient's PBL produced less IgM RF (18 to 62% inhibition). The same inhibition of IgM RF production was observed after EBV infection of the patient's PBL (from 19 to 90% inhibition). In both cases, the remaining IgM RF production was idiotypically indistinguishable from the serum IgM RF. The implications of the idiotypic stability and of the results of in vitro idiotypic manipulation could be important in view of both the understanding of nonmalignant cryoglobulinemia and of the possible therapeutic use of anti-idiotypic antibodies in diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have described a 22 kD IL-1 inhibitor in the supernatant of human monocytes cultured on adherent immune complexes (J. Immunol. 134:3868, 1985). The studies reported herein further detail the conditions of production and biological properties of this IL-1 inhibitor. The inhibitor was produced by human monocytes cultured on adherent human IgG with maximal production between 8 and 24 hr. The IL-1 inhibitor was not performed in the cells but required transcription and new protein synthesis. The inhibitor blocked IL-1 augmentation of PHA-induced murine thymocyte proliferation but not IL-2-induced stimulation of CTLL or HT-2 cell lines. In addition, the inhibitor blocked IL-1-stimulated collagenase production from rabbit articular chondrocytes and IL-1-induced PGE2 production from human fibroblasts and synovial cells. The IL-1 inhibitor was not transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) as determined by: the failure of anti-TGF beta antibodies to reduce IL-1 inhibitory activity, the separation of TGF beta from the IL-1 inhibitor by ion exchange chromatography, and the failure of TGF beta to inhibit IL-1-induced PGE2 production from synovial cells. IL-1 and the inhibitor showed no immunological cross-reactivity by Western blot analysis. The inhibitor specifically blocked binding of IL-1 to its receptor on the murine thymoma cell line EL4-6.1. These results indicate that a specific inhibitor of IL-1-induced immune and inflammatory cell responses is produced by monocytes cultured on adherent immune complexes or adherent IgG. This IL-1 inhibitor may be of importance in modulating the effects of IL-1 in the monocyte microenvironment.\r"

  ".W": "The relative ability of TNF and lymphotoxin (LT) to inhibit the growth of five human tumor cell lines was examined both in the presence and absence of IFN-gamma. Two adenocarcinoma lines, HT-29 and SK-CO-1, were 20- and 320-fold more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of TNF and LT in 3- to 4-day proliferation assays. In contrast, the breast carcinoma line BT-20 showed only a one- to twofold difference. The MCF-7 and ME-180 cell lines exhibited intermediate behavior. These results parallel the reported disparate potencies of TNF and LT in their effects on endothelial cells, hematopoietic development and their abilities to sustain a mixed lymphocyte response. Radiolabeled TNF binding studies showed two classes of receptors (Kd 0.04 to 0.15 nM and 0.2 to 1.0 nM) on the highly sensitive SK-CO-1 line. HT-29 cells also appeared to possess some high affinity-binding sites, whereas the BT-20 line completely lacked the high affinity form. Thus the presence of high affinity-binding sites correlated with increased sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of TNF. Cold TNF competed with the binding of radiolabeled human TNF three- to fivefold better than LT for binding to all three lines. These relatively small differences between the TNF and LT receptor-binding characteristics are insufficient to explain the dramatic disparity in their antiproliferative properties. Likewise, the absolute concentrations of the unlabeled cytokines necessary to block the binding of 125I-TNF were 10- to 150-fold higher than the levels necessary to elicit the biologic response. Thus, the receptor binding data conflict with the growth inhibitory effects. This discrepancy is discussed in terms of either separate receptors for TNF and LT or more complex phenomena such as receptor cooperativity possibly resulting from multivalent interactions with the trimeric form of TNF.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to address three specific questions in human B cells. First, to determine whether transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)2 has similar biologic effects on B cell function as does TGF-beta 1. Second, to test the hypothesis that TGF-beta 1 is an autocrine growth and differentiation inhibitor. Finally, because multiple receptor species for TGF-beta have been identified on other cell types, to determine by chemical cross-linking and competitive binding studies the nature of the TGF-beta 1 R present on normal and transformed B cells. Exogenous TGF-beta 2 was found to be functionally similar to TGF-beta 1 in its inhibition of factor dependent normal B cell proliferation and Ig secretion. When an antibody, specific for the active form of TGF-beta 1, was added in conjunction with IL-2 to previously stimulated B cell cultures, there was a 14.4 +/- 4.2% increase in B cell proliferation, a 22 +/- 6% increase in IgG production, and a 33 +/- 8.6% increase in IgM production when compared to control cultures. Chemical cross-linking of 125I-TGF-beta 1 to normal B cell membranes identified two major cross-linked species of 65 and 90 kDa. A fivefold excess of unlabeled TGF-beta 1 competitively inhibited the detection of both of these bands while a 50-fold excess of unlabeled TGF-beta 2 did not inhibit the 90-kDa band and only partially inhibited (60%) of the 65-kDa band. Chemical cross-linking of 125I-TGF-beta 1 to transformed B cell membranes identified only a single band of 60 kDa. Scatchard plot analysis of 125I-TGF-beta 1 binding to normal B cells that was competitively inhibited with increasing concentrations of unlabeled TGF-beta 1 revealed both high and low affinity binding sites whereas analysis of 125I-TGF-beta 1 binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled TGF-beta 2 revealed only low affinity sites. These findings demonstrate that TGF-beta 2 is as effective as TGF-beta 1 in inhibiting human B cell function, that small amounts of active TGF-beta 1 are present endogenously in in vitro cultures which partially inhibit B cell function, that two major TGF-beta 1 R cross-linked complexes of 65 and 90 kDa are present on normal B cells, and that transformation of B cells may be accompanied by changes in the TGF-beta 1 R.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we have explored the relationship between interleukins and human basophil activation. Previous studies by ourselves and others have found that recombinant human (rh) IL-3 causes histamine release. The ability to release histamine has also been claimed for IL-1 but we cannot confirm this. In experiments with the basophils of 29 donors (excluding one D2O responder), histamine release with 100 ng/ml rhIL-1 alpha was 1.3 +/- 1% (SEM), whereas with rhIL-1 beta, it was 0.8 +/- 1%. Both IL-1 alpha and -1 beta were also used at concentrations of 0.01 to 1000 ng/ml without causing release. Neither increasing the Ca2+ concentration nor adding D2O or cytochalasin B caused IL-1 alpha and -1 beta to become secretagogues. rhIL-1, however, did augment IgE-dependent histamine release. The enhancement was similar with both rhIL-1 alpha and -1 beta, i.e. they were dose-dependent between 0.1 and 3 ng/ml and reached a plateau from 3 to 100 ng/ml. At submaximal histamine release (less than 10%), there was enhancement of three IgE-dependent secretagogues: 125% with goat anti-human IgE (n = 7), 215% with Ag E (n = 10), and 260% with a histamine releasing factor (n = 7). Non-IgE-dependent stimuli (formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine and the ionophore A23187, n = 10) were enhanced less than 5%. rhIL-1-enhancement persisted after cell washing (n = 10). rhIL-1 was active in preparations of 50 to 75% pure basophils in which mononuclear cells were reduced by greater than 95% (n = 4), and mAbH34 to IL-1 beta blocked the enhancement caused by that molecule. We postulate that basophils have an IL-1 receptor which, when occupied, upregulates the response to IgE-related signals. Thus, this work characterizes a second interaction between interleukins and the cells central to the allergic response.\r"

Murine macrophages of the P388D1 cell line stimulated with LPS, subsequently fixed with paraformaldehyde, induced the proliferation of C3H/HeJ mouse thymocytes in the presence of a submitogenic concentration of Con A. Membrane IL-1 on P388D1 cells stimulated with LPS induced bone resorption in organ cultures of neonatal BALB/c mouse calvaria. Polyclonal antibodies directed against membrane IL-1 and soluble IL-1 from P388D1, and monospecific rabbit anti-murine rIL-1 alpha serum neutralized the membrane IL-1 activity, as measured by the thymocyte proliferation. In addition, these antibodies suppressed the bone resorption induced by membrane IL-1. The bone resorption induced by membrane IL-1 required direct contact between mouse calvaria and membrane IL-1. Salmon calcitonin strongly suppressed the calcium release from mouse calvaria in the presence of membrane IL-1. Indomethacin partially inhibited the bone resorption induced by membrane IL-1 on P388D1 cells. Moreover, membrane IL-1 on LPS-stimulated BALB/c mouse peritoneal macrophages or LPS-stimulated osteoblastic cells from BALB/c mouse calvaria induced bone resorption in vitro. These results suggest that membrane IL-1 on macrophages and osteoblastic cells may have a significant role in inflammatory bone resorption in vivo.\r"

Using this technique, we have produced a panel of antibodies that react specifically with permeabilized T lymphocytes but not with permeabilized B lymphocytes or native T cells. One of these antibodies, designated TIA-2, was found to react with greater than 98% of peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Immunoblotting experiments showed TIA-2 to recognize a 32 kd protein that was reduced to 16 kDa in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitates analyzed on non-reducing/reducing diagonal polyacrylamide gels showed the homodimeric structure recognized by TIA-2 to be associated with additional structures whose pattern closely resembled that of the T cell receptor complex. When immunoprecipitates formed using antibodies reactive with CD3 epsilon were immunoblotted with TIA-2, the homodimeric TCR zeta chain was specifically recognized. Using TIA-2 as a TCR zeta specific reagent, we show that whole cell expression of this TCR subunit is dramatically reduced following exposure to mAb reactive with CD3. mAb reactive with activating epitopes of CD2 were also capable of down-modulating the expression of TCR zeta, but to a lesser degree. Exposure to Con A or IL-2, on the other hand, did not reduce the whole cell expression of TCR zeta. Given the central importance of TCR zeta in the expression of a functionally competent Ag receptor, its reduced expression in response to certain activating stimuli is likely to play an important role in regulating T cell responsiveness.\r"

All the analyzed Id require the association of the H and L chain of mAb KS13 for their expression. The mAb R1-38 and R18-9 were shown to markedly differ in their ability to modulate immune lysis of target cells mediated by mAb KS13. mAb R18-9 did not affect C-dependent lysis of cultured B lymphoid cells WALK mediated by mAb KS13, but enhanced cell-dependent mAb KS13-mediated lysis. mAb R1-38 inhibited both C and cell-dependent lysis mediated by mAb KS13. The effect was influenced by the incubation conditions. mAb R1-38 completely inhibited lysis when it was preincubated with mAb KS13 before being added to target cells, inhibited it partially when it was added simultaneously with mAb KS13 to target cells and did not affect it when added to target cells which had been preincubated with mAb KS13. Neither mAb R1-38 nor R18-9 in combination with mAb KS13 modulated T cell proliferation induced by allogeneic HLA mismatched lymphocytes.

The fully ionized form ATP4- rather than MgATP2- mediated the increased permeability of the plasma membrane. Although prolonged exposure to exogenous ATP ultimately lysed the lymphocytes, two CTL populations (CHM-14 clone and CTLL-2 line) and IL-2-treated spleen lymphocytes with unrestricted killing activity were highly resistant to the permeabilizing action of extracellular ATP at all concentrations tested. In addition, CTL derived from primary immune peritoneal exudate and enriched by in vitro culture for 5 days in the presence of specific stimulator cells were also resistant to this permeabilizing effect.

Initial experiments demonstrated that the addition of BSO at the initiation of culture, or shortly thereafter (6 hr), inhibited DNA synthesis and produced a simultaneous decrease in intracellular GSH. It was necessary that the BSO be present in the culture for at least 24 hr prior to the initiation of DNA synthesis for maximal inhibition. Cell cycle analysis revealed that BSO did not affect the entry and progression of PBMC through G1 of the cell cycle, however, entry into S-phase was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion. These results were further substantiated by the inability of BSO to inhibit IL-2 production and expression of the IL-2R. In addition the timely expression of the transferrin receptor by BSO-treated cells indicated that the block occurred at the G1/S transition. The influence of GSH on early activation events was determined by BSO pretreatments. Lowering the intracellular GSH level of PBMC to less than 10% of the initial content prior to mitogenic stimulation did not impair the ability of these cells to produce IL-2 and express IL-2R, indicating that GSH may not be involved in the generation and response to early activation signals. Furthermore, the removal of BSO from these cultures rapidly reversed its inhibitory effects on DNA and GSH synthesis. In the course of these studies we also observed a modest (17%) albeit consistent increase during activation in the total thiol levels of GSH-depleted PBMC. These thiols may have a key role in the activation process. These data support our hypothesis that GSH is required for lymphocyte proliferation and that additional thiols are involved during the activation process.\r"

Dose-response analysis indicated that only 10(2) to 10(3) cloned CTL injected intracerebrally were required to induce mortality in 50% of inoculated syngeneic mice. Thus relatively few virus-specific CTL are required to induce an acute immunopathologic disease in the central nervous system.

  ".W": "We studied immunity to the blood stage of the rodent malaria, Plasmodium vinckei vinckei, which is uniformly lethal to mice. BALB/c mice develop solid immunity after two infections and drug cure. The following experiments define the basis of this immunity. Transfer of pooled serum from such immune mice renders very limited protection to BALB/c mice and no protection to athymic nu/nu mice. Moreover, B cell-deficient C3H/HeN mice develop immunity to P. vinckei reinfection in the same manner as immunologically intact mice, an observation made earlier. In vivo depletion of CD4+ T cells in immune mice abrogates their immunity. This loss of immunity could be reversed through reconstitution of in vivo CD4-depleted mice with fractionated B-, CD8-, CD4+ immune spleen cells; however, adoptive transfer of fractionated CD4+ T cells from immune spleen into naive BALB/c or histocompatible BALB/c nude mice does not render recipients immune. In vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells did not influence the parasitemia in nonimmune or immune mice. Splenectomy of immune mice completely reverses their immunity. Repletion of splenectomized mice with their own spleen cells does not reconstitute their immunity. We conclude that some feature of the malaria-modified spleen acts in concert with the effector/inducer function of CD4+ T cells to provide protection from P. vinckei. To be consistent with this finding, a malaria vaccine may require a combination of malaria Ag to induce immune CD4+ T cells and an adjuvant or other vaccine vehicle to alter the spleen.\r"

  ".W": "HTLV-I (human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1) is the retrovirus causally related to adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma and is also associated with a neurological disorder, tropical spastic paraparesis, or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy. The development of these two different diseases among HTLV-I-infected individuals may depend in part on differences in their T cell immunity associated with a difference of HLA phenotype. Peptides corresponding to 17 sites in the HTLV-I envelope protein were tested for their antigenicity for lymph node cells from B10.BR, B10.D2, B10.A(5R), and B10.HTT congenic mice, representing four independent MHC haplotypes, immunized with the native envelope protein. Ten of the 17 tested sites were predicted to be amphipathic alpha-helical sites and all of them were found to be antigenic for at least one of the four MHC congenic strains of mice. Three of the 17 sites were amphipathic 3(10)-helical sites and four sites were predicted to be non-helical sites: none of the 3(10)-helical sites were antigenic and only one of four non-predicted sites was found to be immunodominant. Furthermore, three potent immunodominant peptides, V1E1 (342-363), V1E8/SP4a (191-209), and V1E10 (141-156) were also shown to be immunogenic; i.e., these peptides could be used to immunize mice to elicit proliferative responses of lymph node cells to the native HTLV-I envelope protein. Furthermore, these three peptides were able to prime animals for an enhanced antibody response to the native protein. Because this priming followed the same Ir gene control as the proliferative response, it probably reflects the ability of these peptides to prime helper T cells. The localization of immunodominant sites in HTLV-I envelope protein in mice may be useful for finding antigenic and immunogenic sites in humans, for developing a peptide vaccine for the virus, and possibly for aiding in prognosis for the development of different disease manifestations of HTLV-I infection.\r"

  ".W": "Early region E3 of adenovirus (Ad) appears to encode proteins involved in the interaction of the virus with the host immune system. The E3 region 19-kDa glycoprotein (gp19K) binds to class I MHC Ag in the endoplasmic reticulum and inhibits their transport to the cell surface; it has been proposed that this protects virus infected cells from lysis by CTL. We have found that the E3 14.7-kDa protein (14.7K) inhibits lysis of infected cells by TNF, and here we show that it also protects cells from lysis by lymphotoxin, which has been implicated as a mediator of CTL lysis. We have developed a method for producing CTL specific for human Ad2 and Ad5 in mice, in order to test directly which of the genes in the E3 region protect infected cells from lysis by virus specific CTL. The presence of the E3 region inhibits both the induction of Ad-specific CTL in culture and the lysis of infected target cells by these CTL. The inhibition varies between different mouse strains, with almost complete inhibition in C57BL/10 (H-2b) mice, partial inhibition with BALB/c (H-2d) and little or no inhibition with C3H (H-2k); results were similar for Ad2 and Ad5. By using a panel of E3 deletion mutants, inhibition of target cell lysis by Ad5 specific CTL was mapped exclusively to the gp19K gene. The 14.7K gene had no effect on CTL lysis despite its ability to protect cells against lysis by lymphotoxin. gp19K was synthesized abundantly in mouse cells by mutants retaining the gp19K gene; some mutant forms of the protein were synthesized but were nonfunctional. These data support the hypothesis that gp19K can protect Ad infected cells against lysis by virus specific CTL.\r"

Cell-free HSV mainly activated CD4+ CTL precursors, whereas HSV-infected fibroblasts were more effective in activating CD8+ CTL precursors than CD4+ CTL precursors. In addition, limiting dilution analyses with enriched T cells from two HSV-seropositive donors revealed that the frequency of HSV-specific CD4+ CTL precursors responsive to stimulation with free HSV was approximately 1/4,000 to 6,000 CD4+ T cells, whereas that of precursors responsive to stimulation with HSV-infected fibroblasts was approximately 1/19,000 to 22,000 CD4+ T cells. Conversely, the frequency of CD8+ CTL precursors in peripheral blood responsive to stimulation with free HSV was approximately 1/28,000 to 30,000 CD8+ T cells, whereas that of precursors responsive to stimulation with HSV-infected fibroblasts was approximately 1/10,000 to 11,000 CD8+ T cells. The present data suggest that generalized viral infection due to cell-free viruses is fought mainly by CD4+ CTL, which have previously been reported to possess both cytotoxicity and helper function, and that localized viral infection on HLA class II-negative fibroblasts is prevented from spreading to adjacent cells mainly by CD8+ CTL. Such differential activation of CD4+ and CD8+ CTL seems probable when considering the protective mechanisms against viral infection.\r"

In order to understand the evolutionary relatedness of the human and murine proteins, we have used the coding sequences from the human CR2 gene to investigate those homologous sequences of murine Cr2. Human CR2 cDNA sequences were used as probes on a cDNA library derived from BALB/c spleen mRNA to identify cross-reacting cDNA sequences. A number of putative cDNA clones encoding murine Cr2 have been isolated and examined. DNA sequence analysis of these Cr2 cDNA clones indicates that they represent the murine homolog to human CR2. mRNA analysis with these Cr2 cDNA clones has revealed a transcription pattern similar to, but distinct from that seen for CR2. Whereas human CR2 coding sequences identify a single mRNA species of approximately 5 kb from human tonsillar mRNA, the murine counterpart identifies four transcripts from murine spleen of approximately 3, 5, 9 and 11 kb in size. The Cr2 cDNA clones which detect the four forms of spleen mRNA overlap in coding sequences and contain exons mapping to three colinear fragments as defined by EcoRI digestion. This suggests that the 3- 5-, 9-, and 11-kb mRNA forms arise by alternative splicing from a single gene. Use of these murine Cr2-specific cDNA clones to isolate their respective genomic sequences has allowed for the linkage of the 3' end of the Cr2 gene to the 5' end of the Crry gene, the evolutionary homolog to human CR1.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of polymorphic residues on the A alpha A beta molecule on T cell recognition of the N-terminal nonapeptide of myelin basic protein (R1-9) was determined. Ak-restricted T cell clones recognizing R1-9 were isolated. The peptide-Ia specificities of these clones were determined by testing the response to 1) a panel of peptide analogs of R1-11, 2) splenic APC from mice expressing MHC molecules from serologically distinct haplotypes, and 3) L cell transfectants expressing mutant/recombinant A beta cDNA containing combinations of polymorphic nucleotide sequences from the k and u alleles. Comparisons were made between the Ak-restricted clones and a previously characterized panel of Au-restricted clones. Certain Ak-restricted clones were able to recognize MBP peptide analogs that were not recognized by any of the Au-restricted clones. The Au-restricted T cell clones did not cross-react with R1-9 presented in the context of Ak, whereas the majority of the Ak-restricted clones responded to R1-9 presented in the context of Au. This nonreciprocal cross-reactivity was also reflected in the relative responses of the two sets of T cell clones to the interchange of u- and k-derived residues in the A beta chain. Residues in regions corresponding both the alpha-helical or beta-sheet portions of the hypothetical Ia three-dimensional structure were involved. The results suggest that overall specificity of the T cell clones is the summation of numerous distinct subspecificities for different regions of the peptide-Ia ligand. These results indicate that there can be striking differences in T cell specificity for an autoantigenic epitope, even in the context of A alpha A beta molecules from very closely related haplotypes.\r"

  ".W": "A kinetic analysis of cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) at the population level based on theoretical models has been performed. This analysis considers that the binding process and the kinetics of the lytic process occur through different types of conjugates: LTn, i.e., conjugates containing one effector cell and n target cells, and LmT conjugates which contain m effector cells bound to one target cell. This allowed us to provide a quantitative description of the conjugation process, and of the binding capacities of the effector and target cells. Thus, it has been shown that these processes are governed by an equilibrium in which are involved the unbound effector and target cells, and the conjugates formed. This implies that, when the equilibrium concentrations are reached, the total number of conjugates cannot be increased from the unbound effector and target cells. However, it does not mean that the free effector cells are nonbinding, and so, when the conditions of equilibrium are perturbated (as occurs for example in CMC), all effector cells, virgin and those who have already participated in the lytic process, are able to form new conjugates. The existence of this equilibrium has also important consequences when different subpopulations are separated from an effector-target system. Thus, it explains the observation reported in the literature that, although cytometric techniques can be used to detect and count different types of conjugates, the conjugates formed cannot be separated by cell sorting (unless special precautions are taken). Finally, we have found that the number of target cells killed by one effector cell, which has been previously considered as the recycling capacity of an effector population, is in reality the result of two different mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is due to the recycling process, whereas the other (which has the same effect) is due to the multiple killing capacity of the LTn conjugates which kill more than one target cell. The average number of target cells killed per conjugate has been determined, and this allowed us to obtain the relative contributions of these two mechanisms to the total killing capacity of one effector cell. It appears that the recycling capacities of effector cell populations previously determined had been 1- to 3-fold overestimated.\r"

To better define the importance of the HIV-1-specific response in this phenomenon, we first studied whether in vitro spontaneous anti-HIV-1 antibody production was accompanied by reactivation of memory B lymphocytes. Unstimulated PBL from HIV-1-infected individuals with prior history of hepatitis B and/or EBV infection did not consistently show spontaneous in vitro synthesis of anti-hepatitis B core Ag or anti-EBV antibodies; in addition, PWM-induced synthesis of anti-hepatitis B virus and anti-EBV antibodies was decreased compared to HIV-1-seronegative subjects. Moreover, in comparing the frequencies of activated HIV-1-specific B cell precursors and activated Ig-secreting precursors in limiting dilution experiments, a sizable fraction (20 to 40%) of circulating cells spontaneously secreting Ig produced antibody against HIV-1 determinants. The ratio between the two frequencies fitted in very well with the amount of Ig removed from unstimulated culture supernatants after HIV-1-specific antibody absorption with solid-phase HIV-1. These findings indicate that B cell activation during HIV-1 infection is mainly oriented toward a specific response to HIV-1 determinants; the possible relevance of this phenomenon to lymphomagenesis in AIDS patients is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We have looked for IL-6, a cytokine that has immunomodulating and inflammation-associated activities, in joint exudates (fluid and mononuclear cells) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritides using both biologic and biochemical assays. IL-6 was assessed by its ability to stimulate alpha 1-antichymotrypsin secretion from the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B clone 2, an activity which is blocked by an antiserum to Escherichia coli derived IL-6, and by the growth of the IL-6-dependent murine hybridoma 7TD1 cell line. IL-6 isoforms in synovial fluid were characterized by immunoaffinity chromatography followed by Western blotting. The presence of IL-1 in synovial fluids and its production by synovial fluid mononuclear cells was monitored by Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-IL-1 beta antisera. In an analysis of 30 effusions from 27 rheumatoid patients with acutely inflamed joints, abundant quantities of IL-6 (greater than 2 ng/ml) were detected in 23 by the alpha 1-antichymotrypsin bioassay. Several rheumatoid synovial fluids also had elevated IL-6 levels in the 7TD1 bioassay. Seven of nine nonrheumatoid effusions also contained high levels of IL-6 (greater than 2 ng/ml). No IL-1 (less than 0.25 ng/ml) could be detected by Western blotting in 10 rheumatoid effusions even though eight of these contained high levels of IL-6. The IL-6 activity could be neutralized with a rabbit antiserum to rIL-6. Multiple IL-6 isoforms (25, 30, 45 kDa) were present in two rheumatoid and one traumatic effusion studied. Fresh mononuclear cells isolated from various synovial effusions did not appear to make IL-6 constitutively, as no IL-6 could be detected in the media of cells cultured for 12 to 18 h after isolation. Similarly, there was no constitutive production of IL-1 by these cells. However, synovial fluid mononuclear cells could be induced to secrete both IL-6 and IL-1 after stimulation with LPS. The LPS-responsive cells were monocytes and not lymphocytes or dendritic cells. These findings suggest that IL-6 is involved in inflammatory joint disease. However, the primary cells synthesizing it may be located in the synovial lining instead of the joint exudate.\r"

The LN400 cell line was capable of adoptively transferring CREAE to naive SJL mice and proliferated specifically to synthetic peptides corresponding to MBP residues(90-101) and an N-acetylated analogue of this epitope, as well as MBP. Moreover, the cell line generated Ag-specific CTL responses only against syngeneic targets that had been pulsed with these Ag. Targets pulsed with irrelevant Ag were not lysed. These CTL responses were MHC restricted to H-2s and were inhibited if targets were preincubated with mAb specific for relevant class II Ag. No inhibition was seen if targets were preincubated with mAb specific for class I Ag, indicating that the CTL responses generated by this L3T4+ Lyt-2.2- cell lines were class II restricted. Studies designed to detect nonspecific CTL through a bystander mechanism failed to demonstrate significant lysis of bystander targets by this Ag-specific cell line. These findings have relevance in defining potential mechanisms of disease induction in this model autoimmune disease.\r"

In order to characterize the evolution over time of HIV-specific CTL, we have analyzed the cytotoxic function and the cell surface phenotype of the alveolar lymphocytes from 41 patients at various stages of HIV disease. We demonstrated a progressive decline of alveolar anti-HIV CTL activity and detected Ts cells from the lungs of patients with advanced HIV disease. These alveolar T cells strongly suppressed the effector phase of anti-HIV CTL lysis. They lacked a marked specificity of function because they also block anti-HLA CTL response and were not restricted by the HLA-class-I transplantation Ag. They displayed the CD3, CD8, and HNK1 markers, were CD4 and CD16 negative, and lacked NK activity. The presence of Ts cells at late stages of HIV disease could thus partly explain the inefficiency of host defenses against HIV.\r"

  ".W": "The induction of transplantation tolerance to H-2b alloantigens in BALB/c (H-2d) mice by neonatal injection of (C57BL/6 x BALB/c)F1 spleen cells, produces an autoimmune lupus-like syndrome due to an activation of persisting F1 donor B cells. This syndrome is characterized by hypergammaglobulinaemia, high levels of anti-DNA antibodies, as well as by circulating immune complexes and glomerular deposits of Ig. The role of host T cells in this model was investigated by using athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice as recipients of normal (C57BL/6 x BALB.Igb)F1 spleen cells. In these \"tolerized\" BALB/c nu/nu mice, there was a persistence of F1 donor B cells but none of the autoimmune features were expressed, conversely to tolerized BALB/c nu/+ littermates. The injection of CD4+CD8- T lymphocytes from adult normal BALB/c mice in 3-wk-old tolerized BALB/c nu/nu mice triggered the appearance of all the autoimmune findings observed in euthymic tolerant mice. The autoantibodies were produced by persisting F1 donor B cells as shown by allotype analysis. More strikingly, a similar triggering of the autoimmune syndrome, including high titers of anti-DNA IgG antibodies and circulating immune complexes, was observed after injection of CD4+CD8- T cells from 2-wk-old tolerant BALB/c mice into \"tolerized\" BALB/c nu/nu mice. The anti-ssDNA antibodies were shown to bear only the Ighb allotype, indicating their exclusive origin from F1 donor B cells. These results imply that CD4+ T cells from the tolerant mice are necessary for the activation of autoreactive F1 B cells and for the development of the autoimmune syndrome occurring in this model. They also suggest that, although there is a marked depletion of H-2b-specific alloreactive CTL precursors in those neonatally tolerized mice, this state of tolerance can be associated with the persistence of H-2b-specific alloreactive CD4+ cells.\r"

The enhanced CTL response was suppressed by adding back irradiated, unfractionated PBMC or adherent cells to the depleted cells. This finding suggests that the enhanced CTL response was not simply a consequence of enrichment of T cells, but was instead due to active suppression by radioresistant cells contained in the adherent fraction. Of note is the finding that, unlike the CTL response, the proliferative response to allostimulation was not affected by the removal of adherent cells. The suppressor function could be abrogated by preincubation of irradiated PBMC with influenza A virus before the coculture with depleted cells. Furthermore, costimulation of unfractionated PBMC with influenza A virus and allogeneic stimulators augmented allospecific CTL activity. Thus, in the adherent fraction of human PBMC, there appears to be a native suppressor population that can be functionally inactivated by virus. This result may account for the clinical observation of increased allograft rejection after certain viral infections.\r"

In this study, the IL-2R expression of lpr/lpr T cells was examined to assess the contribution of IL-2-mediated division to their expansion.

  ".U": "89381372\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that IL-2R are composed of at least two polypeptide chains of 55 kDa (Tac or alpha-chain) and 70 to 75 kDa (p70 or beta-chain). The association of both chains forms high affinity IL-2R, whereas each chain alone binds IL-2 with a low (alpha-chain) or intermediate (beta-chain) affinity. So far, the p70 peptide has been found, in the absence of the Tac peptide, on the surface of lymphoid cells of T, B, or NK lineage. In this study, we investigated whether leukemic cells of various hemopoietic lineages expressed the p70 IL-2-binding protein. We found that both fresh leukemic cells obtained from patients, and cells from established leukemic lines of T cells, B cell, and myeloid origin constitutively expressed a p70 IL-2-binding protein on their surface, as detected by affinity cross-linking of radioiodinated IL-2. IL-2 binding and cross-linking to these cells was completely inhibited in the presence of an excess unlabeled rIL-2, but not with an anti-Tac mAb. Binding experiments on pre-B and myeloid cell lines revealed intermediate affinity IL-2R, whereas both high and intermediate affinity IL-2R were detected in T leukemic cells. The intermediate affinity binding of 125I-rIL-2 to the leukemic cell lines MOLT4 and Reh6 was inhibited by the TU27 mAb, which recognized the p75 chain of IL-2R. Moreover, the TU27 mAb could stain the K562, KM3, and MOLT4 (weakly) cell lines by indirect immunofluorescence. A high dose of rIL-2 (400 U/ml) enhanced the proliferation of cells from one out of three patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, but it did not induce differentiation of the cells in any of three cases. Thus the finding of p70 IL-2-binding molecules on immature lymphoid and nonlymphoid hemopoietic cells should disclose new biologic functions for IL-2.\r"

In preliminary studies we determined that sufficient endogenous IL-6 was produced in LPS-induced cell systems to obscure responses to exogenous IL-6. We therefore studied IL-6 effects on Peyer's patch B cells (T cell-depleted cell populations) in the absence of LPS, relying on responses of in vivo-activated cells. rIL-1 alpha or purified IL-6 only slightly enhanced synthesis of IgM over minimal baseline levels in Peyer's patch T cell-depleted cell cultures; however, when IL-6 was added to cultures also containing rIL-1, IgM synthesis was very substantially increased. In addition, rIL-5 alone gave rise to a modest increase in IgM synthesis and its effect was not enhanced by either rIL-1 or IL-6. IgG production (mainly IgG3) followed a similar pattern. In contrast, IgA production was only modestly increased above baseline by rIL-1, rIL-5, or IL-6 alone or by rIL-1 and IL-6 in combination, but was greatly increased by rIL-5 and IL-6 in combination. The effect of IL-6 on Ig synthesis in the above studies was not due to an effect on cell proliferation. In summary, these data indicate that B cells differ in respect to the cytokines supporting maximal terminal differentiation and thus the class of Ig produced may depend on the presence of a particular combination of cytokines and lymphokines.\r"

This histamine release inhibitory factor (HRIF) is produced by PBMC upon stimulation with histamine as well as mitogens such as Con A. The objective of this study was to investigate the cellular origin of HRIF produced by PBMC. Monocytes, T cells, and B cells were isolated to 96 to 99% purity by a combination of plastic adherence, E rosetting, and negative selection with mAb (OKM1, OKT11, OKB7, OKT4, and OKT8) and C. Purified subpopulations were cultured with histamine or Con A and then the processed supernatants were assayed for the inhibition of HRF-induced histamine release from basophils. The results of this study suggest that the highest amount of HRIF is synthesized by B cells followed by T cells and monocytes. The B cell origin of HRIF was confirmed by abolishing the activity after incubation of the cells with OKB7 mAb and C. Both CD4- and CD8- T cells are capable of producing HRIF. In mixing experiments, the synthesis of HRIF by two different subpopulations has been less than additive. T + B cells produced most of the HRIF activity. Monocytes tended to suppress the synthesis of HRIF by B cells. The synthesis of HRIF by so many cell types suggests that a fine balance between HRIF and HRF may regulate the mediator release from basophils and mast cells.\r"

  ".W": "Transmembrane signaling in CTL is found to be extremely sensitive to short term exposure to long chain free fatty acids (FFA). Both alloantigen specific target cells and the lectin Con A were used to stimulate cloned murine CTL. This stimulation was monitored by changes in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) using the fluorescence indicator fura-2. Treatment of the CTL cells with oleic acid (18:1) at concentrations corresponding to less than 10% (mol/mol) bound to the cell, completely inhibits target cell or Con A-mediated rise in [Ca2+]i. The inhibitory effect of oleic acid is observed within seconds of addition and the inhibition is completely reversed by treating cells with fatty acid free BSA. In addition, using the fluorescence indicator 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)carboxyfluorescein to monitor intracellular pH, it was found that oleic acid itself acidifies the cytosol by about 0.3 to 0.4 pH units. Acidification is probably necessary, but is not sufficient to inhibit the calcium rise. Stearic acid (18:0), even at concentrations that correspond to a factor of two to three more bound to the cell than for oleic acid, had no effect on either the [Ca2+]i or intracellular pH responses. Oleic acid was found to bind to cells with single site kinetics and with a number of sites and affinity corresponding to membrane lipid binding sites. Esterification of added oleic acid was negligible in the time (seconds to minutes) required to induce inhibition of the [Ca2+]i response. Inasmuch as added FFA primarily binds to membrane lipid, is not appreciably esterified, and the inhibition is reversed by treatment with fatty acid free BSA, it is likely that the oleic acid effects are due to a physical perturbation of membrane lipid. Furthermore, oleic acid does not affect Con A binding or the production of inositol phosphate metabolites, suggesting that the inhibition of the response is distal to surface recognition events or receptor-phospholipase C coupling. Given the relatively low levels of FFA at which these effects occur it is possible, under conditions in which FFA levels are elevated, that FFA perturbation may modulate CTL activity.\r"

Stable cell lines were selected in which the retrovirus vector integrated as a single copy in almost all of the individual cell clones examined. The HA mRNA was shown to be of the expected length by Northern blot analysis, but the levels varied among the cell clones. Although the HA transcript was difficult to detect in any of the retrovirus-infected cell clones derived from fibroblasts, HA Ag was easily detected on the cell surface by cytofluorographic analysis. Significantly, retrovirus-infected clones derived from each cell type were recognized by HA-specific class I and class II MHC-restricted T lymphocytes. HA produced in these cells was able to be acquired, processed, and presented to class II-restricted T cells by additional, non-HA-expressing APC. This indicates that HA endogenously synthesized within these cell lines is available for Ag processing by an exogenous route.\r"

The results obtained indicate that for four of six HLA-B7-specific CTL lines the alpha-1 domain for CTL recognition. Furthermore, we found that residues 77 and/or 80 had a critical effect on recognition for all of the CTL lines tested. The region 97-156 in the alpha-2 domain was also important for some of these CTL lines. Furthermore, by using five bulk culture HLA-B27-specific CTL lines we were able to show that residues 77 and/or 80 and residue 152 are also essential for recognition of HLA-B27 by HLA-B27-specific CTL. The strong influence exerted by these residues is discussed in terms of the three-dimensional structure of class I molecules. Finally, a selection was regularly observed in the bulk cultures such that the CTL that were preferentially influenced by either the alpha-1 or the alpha-2 domain were lost after 4 to 7 wk of culture resulting in CTL cell lines which were extremely sensitive to sequence modifications of HLA-B7 or HLA-B27. The possible reasons for this selection, which we have previously observed with both anti-HLA-A2 and anti-HLA-A3 cell lines and is therefore not unique to HLA-B7 or HLA-B27, are discussed.\r"

TdT is normally found only in immature lymphoid cells and is turned off in both mature B and T cells. To investigate the regulation of TdT gene expression, pre-B and pre-T cells were treated with PMA or three of its analogs and its effects on steady-state TdT mRNA levels determined. Rapid and reversible decline in steady-state TdT mRNA levels was observed within 6 h with PMA. This rapid decline can be blocked by pretreatment of the cells with a relatively selective protein kinase C inhibitor implicating the role of protein kinase C activation in the decline of TdT mRNA. Nuclear run-off studies demonstrate that TdT transcription is rapidly down-regulated within 45 min after PMA treatment, indicating that this regulation occurs mainly at the level of transcription. Furthermore, the TdT mRNA decline is blocked in the presence of cycloheximide, showing that new protein synthesis is required for inactivation of the gene.\r"

  ".W": "NK cells, defined here as lymphocytes bearing the CD16 Ag found on the NK cell Fc-gamma receptor (FcR), are known to enter a proliferative and activated state in response to stimulation with IL-2 as assessed by clonal expansion, short-term DNA synthesis, and de novo expression of lymphocyte-associated activation Ag. We have found that the FcR of NK cells acts as a signaling pathway through which IL-2-dependent activation may be greatly enhanced, allowing for more rapid induction of activation Ag and recruitment of an increased percentage of cells expressing surface markers of cellular activation. FcR-interactive agents, such as solid phase immobilized immune complexes or cross-linked CD16-specific mAb, work synergistically with rIL-2 to elicit a rapid expression of IL2R and transferrin receptors on greater than 50% of purified NK cells as early as day 3 of culture. IL-2 or FcR-interactive stimuli alone were weak or ineffective stimulators by comparison. In contrast to the induction of de novo activation Ag, DNA synthesis was elicited by IL-2 alone, but was not substantially or consistently enhanced by the subsequent addition of FcR-interactive stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical efficacy of retinoids in benign and malignant skin diseases involving immune mechanisms suggests that they affect the immunologic functions of the epidermis. However, these effects have yet to be demonstrated. The action of vitamin A (retinol) and the synthetic retinoids, isotretinoin, etretinate, acitretin, and arotinoid-free acid have been studied on the lymphocyte proliferation induced by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), by the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), and the mixed epidermal cell-lymphocyte reaction (MECLR). The results for PHA-induced proliferations were highly variable for all the retinoids. However, in MECLR, the synthetic retinoids consistently reduced the proliferation by 20%-30%. This occurred at therapeutic drug concentrations of about 10(-7)M. In MLR, a minor decrease of 10%-15% was only found for higher concentrations (10(-5)M). Retinol induced no effect in either reaction. Further analysis of acitretin on MECLR showed that it reduced lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. This reduction was combined with a decrease in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte induction (CTL). Addition of 10(-6)M acitretin at various times also revealed that its presence at cell culture initiation was necessary to inhibit proliferation significantly. Furthermore, cell treatments prior to MECLR showed that exposure of epidermal cells to acitretin was essential to produce this inhibition, suggesting that it acts directly on epidermal cells. Consequently, it is suggested that the specific inhibitory effect of synthetic retinoids on lymphocyte activation in MECLR may partly account for their therapeutic action on the skin.\r"

In this report we have found that epicutaneous application of alpha-MSH suppresses both the sensitization and elicitation limbs of the cutaneous immune response (CIR) to potent contact sensitizers like dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) or oxazalone (OX) in mice. Further, the loss of contact hypersensitivity due to applications of alpha-MSH could be reconstituted by either intradermal or intravenous injections of epidermal thymocyte activating factor (ETAF)/interleukin-1. Topical application of alpha-MSH did not cause an alteration in Ia+ dendritic cells (i.e., Langerhans cells) but did produce a significant reduction in the expression of Thy1.2 marker on the Thyl+ dendritic epidermal cells (Thy1+DEC). It has no effects on the phenotypic expression of asialo GM-1 on these same cells. These observations suggest that alpha-MSH, a peptide classically isolated from the pituitary but found in many other tissues and cells of the body, may represent an additional biologic modifier than can modulate suppression of the contact hypersensitivity responses to various haptens. However, the mechanisms by which alpha-MSH or potentially other peptides found in the skin produce these suppressive effects have not been elucidated.\r"

Of the 155 couples, 35 consisted of partners that were both HIV +; 62 of partners that were both HIV-; and 58 were discordant. A binomial model was fit to data obtained in the first visit to estimate per contact risk of HIV transmission. Assuming a constant risk of transmission per sexual contact between infected and uninfected partners, the estimated risk is about 5 to 30 per 1000 receptive anal exposures to ejaculate. Although the average risk of HIV transmission per sexual contact appears to be low, there appears to be great variability in infectivity. To model this variability over time and across individuals, more complex models must be fit to longitudinal studies of sexual partners.\r"

While surveys are typically designed to estimate the prevalence of a disease or medical condition, they can also be used to estimate incidence rates. A limitation of survey data, however, is that recall is prone to errors. Three types of errors are common: telescopic, false negative, and false positive reports. Telescopic reports are thought to be the most common. We propose a method to adjust for recall errors by modeling the reported age of onset (ONST) and the time interval since the reported first occurrence of the medical condition (LAG). A number of models were examined using migraine headache data from over 10,000 subjects in Washington County, Maryland. Population surveys should be considered as a relatively inexpensive means for estimating the age incidence of medical conditions, especially for symptom based problems like back pain, asthma, mental illness, and serious headache. We recommend that data be collected on variables which can be used as surrogates for the different types of recall errors. Specifically, the age at interview, the date when the condition was cured or in remission, the severity of the condition, and possibly a specific inquiry as to how certain the respondent is in reporting the date of medical events, should be considered for this purpose.\r"

For filter coffee drinkers the coffee dose-cholesterol association remained significant only for women. Triglycerides showed a negative association with coffee, significant after adjustment for other variables. This effect was stronger for filter than for boiled coffee in both sexes. For men and women drinking 1 cup of coffee or more, a significant negative association between both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and number of cups of filter coffee was found.

Arm A consisted of infusions of 5-FU at 12 mg/kg/d intravenously (IV) for 5 days followed by weekly infusions of 5-FU at 15 mg/kg; arm B consisted of leucovorin infusions at 200 mg/m2/d IV plus infusions of 5-FU at 400 mg/m2/d IV on days 1 through 5 of a 28-day cycle; arm C consisted of methotrexate at 50 mg/m2 orally every 6 hours for five doses followed by infusions of 5-FU, 500 mg/m2 IV, and leucovorin, 10 mg/m2 orally, every 6 hours for five doses every other week. A total of 265 patients were entered into the trial, of whom 249 (94%) were fully evaluable. The objective response rate (complete [CR] plus partial [PR] responses) was 17.3% on arm A, 18.8% on arm B, and 19.8% on arm C (log-rank test, P greater than .4). The median time to failure was 138 days on arm A, 166 days on arm B, and 182 days on arm C (log-rank test, P values of arm A v B = .06; arm A v arm C = .04). Median survival was 345 days on arm A, 324 days on arm B, and 356 days on arm C (log-rank test, P greater than .4). Treatment with 5-FU alone was significantly more dose intensive and more toxic than either of the experimental combinations. The rates of grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity were 42.3% on arm A, 24.3% on arm B, and 14.3% on arm C. Hematologic toxicity was milder but had the same pattern. This study indicates that these regimens of high-dose leucovorin plus 5-FU and sequential methotrexate, 5-FU, and leucovorin are not more effective than is 5-FU alone for treatment of patients with colorectal carcinomas when 5-FU is administered at high-dose intensity.\r"

In this phase II study of the Leukemia Cooperative Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the efficacy and toxicity of DCF were investigated in patients who were resistant to IFN-a treatment. Resistance was defined as: (1) progressive disease (PD) under IFN-a therapy for more than 2 months; (2) stable disease (SD) after more than 6 months of IFN-a treatment; (3) relapse within 3 months of discontinuing IFN-a; and (4) intolerance to IFN-a because of World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 or 4 toxicity. DCF was applied at a dosage of 4 mg/m2 weekly x 3, then 4 mg/m2 every other week x 3. Responders were given a maintenance therapy once per month for a maximum of 6 months. At the time of report, 33 patients with resistant disease were evaluable for response and toxicity. Median duration of IFN-a therapy before DCF administration was 14.7 months (range, 1 to 41 months). Complete remissions (CRs) were achieved in 11 patients and partial remissions (PRs) in 15, resulting in a total response rate of 78.8%. Median interval between beginning of DCF therapy to best response was 3.9 months with a range from 2.0 to 7.0 months. Two patients who achieved PR have relapsed 7 and 14 months after cessation of DCF therapy. The median duration of response was over 11.5 months (range, over 3.0 to over 24.0 months). Three patients died within the first 6 weeks of DCF treatment: one of drug-unrelated cardiomyopathy and two of fungal pneumonia. The patients with early death (n = 3) and nonresponsive disease (n = 4) received IFN-a treatment for a longer period (median, 18.0 months) than did the 26 responsive patients (median, 10.0 months). Major side effects included nausea, skin rash, and infections and were otherwise mild. Thus, DCF is highly active in patients with HCL resistant to IFN-a.\r"

  ".W": "In patients who have not received extensive prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy, it has been previously demonstrated that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) abrogated the leukopenia following administration of melphalan (25 mg/m2). This study examined the necessity of a prechemotherapy period of G-CSF administration and the effect of varying the timing and duration of postchemotherapy G-CSF. Initially, patients received 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 micrograms/kg/d subcutaneously on days 1 to 5 and days 10 to 18. Melphalan was given on day 9. In the next portion of the study melphalan was administered on day 1 and G-CSF, 10 micrograms/kg/d, was administered by subcutaneous infusion on five schedules: (1) days 2 to 13; (2) days 8 to 13; (3) days 2 to 18; (4) days 8 to 18; (5) days -9 to -2 and 2 to 13. G-CSF produced a rapid and sustained elevation in neutrophil levels within 24 hours even when started 8 days after melphalan. This treatment was sufficient to abrogate the neutropenia in patients who had received no prior chemotherapy. It was not necessary to continue G-CSF for more than 7 days. G-CSF did not consistently alter the course of the thrombocytopenia that followed this dose of melphalan. G-CSF was well tolerated, although mild bone pain occurred and was reduced with acetaminophen. One of 22 patients developed cellulitis at an infusion site. We conclude that after melphalan chemotherapy, G-CSF may need to be given for only a short period to prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, and that G-CSF induces a rapid rise in neutrophil levels even when started 8 days after melphalan administration.\r"

The relaxation was attenuated markedly by treatment of the assay tissue with hydroquinone and abolished by oxyhemoglobin or methylene blue. In this bioassay system, the effect of AA861 and TMK777, new 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, was evaluated. When the donor tissue was treated with AA861 or TMK777, the responses to acetylcholine and substance P were attenuated moderately, whereas the relaxation by nitroglycerin was not influenced by AA861. However, the inhibitors when infused just below the donor tissue did not attenuate relaxant responses to acetylcholine and substance P. Application of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to the donor tissue caused a relaxation of the assay tissue, and potentiated the relaxation by acetylcholine and substance P. AA861 and TMK777 suppressed the relaxant responses to acetylcholine and substance P, respectively, in the presence and absence of SOD to a similar extent and abolished the SOD-induced relaxation. Pyrogallol abolished the relaxation by acetylcholine, but did not inhibit the response when the donor tissue was pretreated with SOD. Therefore, it appears that AA861 and TMK777 do not degrade endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in the perfusate via generation of superoxide anion or block the action of EDRF on vascular smooth muscle, but interfere with the synthesis and/or release of EDRF. The findings obtained so far support the idea that lipoxygenase products participate in the generation of EDRF.\r"

Because the vascular endothelium is now known to influence vascular tone by release of relaxing factors and CyA can damage endothelial cells, it was of interest to determine if CyA could induce a rise in blood pressure (BP) in normal rats and if this was associated with increased vascular responses to constrictor stimuli and/or decreased responses to endothelium-dependent dilators. Male Wistar rats were treated daily for 21 days by gavage with 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg of CyA or olive oil vehicle (1 ml/kg). Creatinine clearance was measured before treatment and on day 19. On day 20 the rats were anesthetized with ether and a carotid artery cannulated and exteriorized. On day 21 mean arterial BP and heart rate were recorded directly for 1 hr while the rats were conscious and unrestrained. An arterial blood sample was taken for analysis of catecholamines by high-performance liquid chromatography. The rats were then anesthetized and both kidneys isolated and perfused at 3 ml/min with Krebs' solution. Vasoconstrictor responses were obtained to periarterial renal nerve stimulation (1-30 Hz) and to bolus injections of norepinephrine (10-300 ng), angiotensin II (1-30 ng) and potassium (30-100 mumol). Perfusion pressure was then increased by 125 mm Hg with a norepinephrine infusion and vasodilator responses obtained to the incremental infusion of acetylcholine (1 nM-1 microM) and nitroprusside (100 nM-3 microM). CyA treatment decreased creatinine clearance and produced a dose-dependent increase in BP and heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acute i.c.v. administration of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) (3.0-30.0 micrograms/kg) decreased responding in both components of a multiple 3-min fixed-interval, 30-response fixed-ratio schedule and under a multiple fixed-ratio schedule in which responding during one component was punished by shock delivery. The rate-decreasing effects of intermediate doses of CRF were blocked by the CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 under the multiple fixed-internal fixed-ratio schedule, with 10.0 micrograms/kg of the antagonist producing a more complete reversal than 30.0 micrograms/kg. The rate-reducing effects of 10.0 and 30.0 micrograms/kg of CRF disappeared rapidly when CRF was administered daily, with complete restoration of responding occurring by the 4th day of chronic administration. Acute effects were recovered when CRF administration was discontinued for 7 to 14 days. Analyses of cerebrospinal fluid revealed that behaviorally active doses of CRF produced large, dose-dependent increases in levels of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and in the dopamine metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid; smaller increases also occurred in the levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol, the metabolite of norepinephrine. Chronic administration of 30 micrograms/kg of CRF for a 4-day period did not reveal any change in metabolite levels when compared to those obtained after acute administration, with the exception of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol which approached control levels after chronic CRF. These results indicate that, as is the case with mammals, CRF has potent behavioral and neurochemical activity in avian species and that tolerance occurs rapidly to the behavioral effects.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the hypothesis that the stimulus properties of a dopaminergic D1 agonist should be functionally discriminable from those of a D2 agonist. Rats were trained in a two-lever food-reinforced drug discrimination paradigm to discriminate either the D1 agonist SKF 38393 from apomorphine (SKF/APO), SKF from saline (SKF/SAL) or apomorphine from saline (APO/SAL), at an APO dose previously established to have D2-mediated stimulus properties. Results showed the SKF/APO discrimination to be readily acquired. The SKF cue showed similar stimulus properties under both the SKF/APO and SKF/SAL training conditions which were mediated by the D1 receptor: the SKF response was blocked by the D1 antagonist SCH 23390, but not by the D2 antagonist haloperidol. Run length data suggested a graded rather than quantal effect of SKF dose on responding during SKF generalization tests. In APO/SAL-trained animals, the APO cue was D2 mediated; responding was blocked by haloperidol, but not by SCH 23390 and APO responding generalized to the selective D2 agonist LY 171555 (quinpirole), but not to SKF. In the SKF/APO condition, APO responding did not decrease with APO dose, nor were antagonists effective in blocking responding, reflecting the lack of an alternative no-drug response option. Higher doses of APO appear to have D1 properties; doses above the training dose engendered SKF responding in both the SKF/SAL and SKF/APO groups, a response which could be blocked by the D1 antagonist SCH 23390, but not by the D2 antagonist, haloperidol. In all three training conditions, generalization test outcomes could be influenced by the conditions of the previous test session.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of SAD-128 [1,1'-oxybis(methylene) bis 4-(1,1-dimethylethyl) pyridinium dichloride], a nonoxime bispyridinium compound, were investigated on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-ion channels of frog muscle fibers using end-plate current (EPC) and single channel current measurement techniques. SAD-128 decreased the EPC peak amplitude in a concentration-dependent manner and caused nonlinearity in the current-voltage plots. The time constant of EPC decay was prolonged by SAD-128 (10-200 microM) at potentials between +50 and -90 mV without loss of the single exponential decay. However, at -100 mV and below, biphasic decays of the EPCs were observed in the presence of the drug. The time constant of the fast phase of the EPC decay decreased, whereas that of the slow phase increased, with either hyperpolarization or increasing concentration of the drug. SAD-128 weakly inhibited acetylcholinesterase in frog sartorius muscle. At the single-channel current level, SAD-128 reduced the mean channel open time and produced a blocked state evidenced as an additional phase in the closed time distribution. The agent induced a biphasic burst time distribution whose fast component became faster and slow component slower with increasing concentration and hyperpolarization. The present study provides more details regarding the kinetics of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ion channel-blocking mechanisms and a correlation between single-channel currents and macroscopic events. The ability of SAD-128 to block the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor may underlie its efficacy in counteracting lethal effect of organophosphorus compounds.\r"

Two populations of cells were grown, which produced significant IL-1 activity when stimulated with the Lyme disease spirochete or its lipopolysaccharide. IL-1 activity from SF or stimulated cells was neutralized with an antihuman IL-1 antibody.

Although autologous blood is free of such risks as transfusion-transmitted diseases, the safety and effectiveness of autologous donations by cardiac patients are debated. We analyzed the records of 291 consecutive patients undergoing elective open heart surgery. One hundred seven (36.8%) donated between 1 and 6 U of autologous blood (mean, 3.0 +/- 1.5 U) before undergoing surgery. First-time elective coronary artery bypass surgery was the most common indication for autologous donation (90.6% of autologous donors). Problems following donations were infrequent (2 of 326 donations) and without long-term consequences. Among patients having coronary artery bypass surgery who donated autologous blood, 27% required homologous blood transfusions as compared with 82% of other patients undergoing the same procedure. We conclude that autologous blood donations are safe for patients with cardiac disease and effective in significantly reducing homologous blood needs in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery.\r"

To examine the potential contribution of these infiltrating cells to the decrease in GFR and RPF that occurs following ureteral obstruction, 16 male Lewis rats (wt 246.4 +/- 4.0 g) were studied in the awake state three hours after unilateral release of 24 hours of bilateral ureteral obstruction (BUO). Eight rats were not irradiated, and eight rats received 1315 rads one day prior to the obstruction. The leukocyte infiltrate following 24 hours of ureteral obstruction was quantified with and without prior irradiation in an additional eight rats. Irradiation reduced cortical infiltration (27.05 +/- 3.07 x 10(5) vs. 1.2 +/- 0.83 x 10(5) cells/g tissue) and medullary infiltration (13.6 +/- 1.79 x 10(5) vs. 0.86 +/- 0.45 x 10(5) cells/g tissue) of leukocytes following BUO (P less than 0.001 for both) and increased postobstruction GFR (1.58 +/- 0.12 vs. 2.97 +/- 0.15 ml/min/kg body wt, P less than 0.001). Eleven rats, six of which received irradiation, underwent sham laparotomy without BUO in order to assess the effect of irradiation alone on renal function. Irradiation had no effect on the renal function of non-obstructed rats. Urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 increased following BUO and this rise was significantly blunted by irradiation prior to BUO (9.53 +/- 2.14 vs. 32.46 +/- 4.95 vs. 19.03 +/- 1.94 pg/min).

CGRP concentration dependently (EC50, 1 nM) also inhibited contraction of mesangial cells by angiotensin II (10 nM). Angiotensin II (10 nM) caused a transient increase of the intracellular calcium concentration from 140 nM to 480 nM in the mesangial cells, but these calcium transients were not altered by CGRP. CGRP (10 nM) decreased vascular resistance in the isolated rat kidney perfused at constant pressure (100 mm Hg; P less than 0.01). The decreased vascular resistance was accompanied by a rise of the glomerular filtration fraction. CGRP, moreover, attenuated the effects of angiotensin II on renal vascular resistance and glomerular filtration (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, CGRP causes relaxation of renal mesangial cells and decreases renal vascular resistance. As a result CGRP raises glomerular filtration and the filtration fraction. The effect may be linked to cyclic AMP formation. Thus, regulation of renal vascular and glomerular function may represent a novel action of CGRP apart from its cardiovascular effects.\r"

The MCR of calcitriol in these rats with renal failure was significantly lower than in control rats with sham operations. Plasma concentrations of calcitriol did not differ between the rats with moderate renal failure and control rats (sham, 74.7 +/- 3.6 pg/ml, N = 7; renal failure, 67.7 +/- 6.0, N = 6; serum creatinine 0.56 +/- 0.02 mg/dl vs. 0.96 +/- 0.02); however, the levels were significantly lower in rats with severe renal failure (sham, 66.5 +/- 5.1 pg/ml, N = 7, severe renal failure, 49.6 +/- 2.1 pg/ml, N = 8; serum creatinine 0.53 +/- 0.01 mg/dl vs. 1.40 +/- 0.03).

Infusion of 25(OH)D3 (600 ng/day) or 24,25(OH)2D3 (1 microgram/day) in rats with renal failure for one week also increased the MCR of calcitriol (25(OH)D3, 0.25 +/- 0.01 ml/min/kg; 24,25(OH)2D3, 0.25 +/- 0.01, both P less than 0.001) when compared to rats with renal failure infused with vehicle (0.21 +/- 0.01).

  ".W": "Viral peritonitis is an exceptionally rare occurrence in peritoneal dialysis. In fact, up to now, only one case report has been documented in the literature. In a prospective study, peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) was specifically cultured for the following viruses: the herpes group of viruses, including herpes simplex types I (HSV) and II, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella-zoster (V-Z), and the enteroviruses group including coxsackie B-5 (Cox B), echo, enterovirus and polio. Cultures were performed under both basal conditions and in the presence of peritonitis. No viral growth was demonstrated. The possible existence of an anti-viral factor in the PDE was therefore raised. In order to investigate this hypothesis, the PDE of 16 patients undergoing intermittent peritoneal dialysis and of 24 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis were examined for anti-viral activity. The method used was analogous to that employed for testing the anti-viral effect of interferon (IFN). The inhibition of the cytopathic effect (CPE) of various viruses was examined in the following tissue cultures: Vero cells (a line of monkey kidney cells) incubated with HSV, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Cox B; human kidney cells incubated with parainfluenza 3 (Para-3); human foreskin fibroblasts incubated with CMV, HSV and VSV and L-929 (a line of mouse cells) incubated with VSV. As control, unused Dianeal (Travenol, Ashdod, Israel) 1.5 and 4.25 g/dl, normal saline and 5 g/dl dextrose solutions were tested under the same conditions using VSV on Vero.

NK cells do not express cell-surface CD3, or any known target recognition structure analogous to the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) heterodimers (alpha beta or gamma delta). Consistent with their lack of expression of a CD3-TCR complex, NK cells do not require prior sensitization or antigen presentation by accessory cells to specifically recognize their tumour targets. Although NK cells do not express CD3-TCR, they do express CD2, the target of an alternative activation pathway which is functional in both T cells and NK cells. In T cells, this alternative activation pathway utilizes some component of the CD3-TCR complex as a transducer molecule that is required for mitogenesis. The fact that NK cells are activated by this alternative pathway suggested that they might express a related subunit of the CD3-TCR complex capable of transducing the CD2-mediated signal. Here we show that human NK cells express the zeta-chain of the TCR complex in association with additional structures not included in CD3-TCR.\r"

Using a cluster sampling technique with systematic allocation of clusters, the authors conducted a national survey of black individuals 30 years of age and older, in St. Lucia. A total of 1679 individuals underwent a screening examination that included visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, and cup/disc (C/D) evaluation. Every third person had a screening field on the Humphrey field analyzer. Individuals with either elevated IOP, abnormal C/D ratio, or an abnormal screening visual field were referred for a definitive examination and threshold visual fields. A total of 520 people were referred. Identified by stringent criteria for the diagnosis of glaucoma, which required reliable threshold visual fields abnormal by the mirror image method, 147 individuals had glaucoma for a prevalence of 8.8% in the 30 years of age and older population.\r"

Although HSV is an oncogenic virus, the virus must be inactivated and lose its cytolytic activity to be oncogenic in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the water-extractable components of smoked tobacco tar condensate (smoked tobacco tar extract) on the growth, cytolytic activity, DNA synthesis, and gene expression of type 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). Diluted tar extracts in tissue culture medium markedly inhibited the replication and cytolytic activity of HSV-1 in vitro. The smoked tobacco tar extract also notably inhibited the synthesis of viral DNA and late gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. The synthesis of alpha- and beta-classes of viral proteins was not affected by the extract. Therefore, it is probable that the smoked tobacco tar extract inhibits the synthesis of viral DNA directly rather than indirectly by depressing early gene expression.\r"

Although CCGG sequences within the C21 gene are de novo methylated, CCGG sites within flanking vector sequences, other mammalian gene sequences driven by the C21 promoter, and the neomycin-resistance gene, which was cotransfected with the C21 gene, do not become methylated. At least two separate signals for de novo methylation are encoded within the gene since three fragments derived from the C21 gene were methylated de novo. Specific de novo methylation of C21-derived sequences does not occur in L cells or Y1 kin8 cells; this suggests that the cellular factors needed for de novo methylation of the C21 gene are not ubiquitous. Most DNA sequences are not de novo methylated when introduced into somatic cells and DNA sequences other than the C21 gene are not de novo methylated when introduced into Y1 cells. Several groups have suggested that de novo methylation occurs in early embryonic cells and that somatic cells strictly maintain their methylation pattern by a semiconservative methyltransferase. Our results suggest that de novo methylation of specific nucleotide sequences can occur in some mammalian somatic cells.\r"

  ".W": "pp42, a low-abundance 42-kDa protein, becomes transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine after stimulation of fibroblasts by a variety of mitogens, including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, thrombin, and insulin-like growth factor II. The induction of pp42 phosphorylation on tyrosine by such diverse mitogenic agents suggests an important role for pp42 in the cascade of events necessary for cell transition from G0 into the cell cycle. However, as with most proteins identified on the basis of their tyrosine phosphorylation, the function of pp42 in cellular regulation is unknown. In this manuscript we report evidence that suggests that pp42 is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. Stimulation of 3T3-L1 cells with insulin has been shown to activate a cytosolic serine/threonine kinase capable of phosphorylating microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase II. This cytosolic serine/threonine protein kinase, which itself is phosphorylated on tyrosine, has been termed \"MAP kinase\". We now report that pp42 phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation occur in fibroblasts in response to similar mitogens, that the two proteins comigrate on one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels, and that the two proteins copurify chromatographically. The major peptides generated from purified MAP kinase by V8 protease digestion are present as a subset of the peptides in digests of pp42 excised from two-dimensional gels. Thus, the results suggest that MAP kinase is tyrosine-phosphorylated pp42.\r"

To investigate the role of the CD3 epsilon subunit in signal transduction, we have transfected a murine hybridoma T-cell line with either wild-type or variant human CD3 epsilon cDNA that encodes a protein lacking 49 of the 55 cytoplasmic amino acid residues. Both wild-type and truncated CD3 epsilon human proteins assemble with endogenous murine CD3/Ti subunits to form functional surface TCRs: Anti-human CD3 epsilon monoclonal antibodies bind exclusively to these chimeric TCRs and trigger interleukin 2 production from the murine cells. Thus, the CD3 epsilon cytoplasmic domain is not required for assembly of the multimeric TCR. Furthermore, it is dispensable for the transduction of a stimulus delivered to the external part of the molecule, suggesting that interaction between the transmembrane and/or external regions of the other TCR chains is a prerequisite for transmembrane signaling.\r"

  ".W": "The lymphocyte low-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RII) is involved in two seemingly unrelated processes: (i) promotion of general B-cell growth and (ii) isotype-specific IgE synthesis. To characterize domains of Fc epsilon RII important for effector function, we have expressed Fc epsilon RII mutants in mammalian cells. The results show that the IgE-binding region of Fc epsilon RII corresponds almost exactly to a domain of 123 amino acid residues homologous with the carbohydrate-binding domain of C-type animal lectins. With the recent demonstration that Fc epsilon RII binds to IgE independently of any lectin-like activity [Vercelli, D., Helm, B., Marsh, P., Padlan, E., Geha, R.S. & Gould, H. (1989) Nature (London) 338, 649-651], it is now clear that, in this case, the lectin module has evolved to interact with a protein rather than a carbohydrate moiety. The epitopes of several independent monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the binding of IgE to Fc epsilon RII are clustered within the lectin-like domain. Some of these antibodies are also known to suppress, isotype-specifically, the interleukin 4-promoted IgE synthesis from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the spontaneous synthesis of IgE by B cells isolated from atopic donors. The epitope of MHM6, an anti-F epsilon RII monoclonal antibody delivering an epitope-restricted growth-promoting effect on B cells, is also located within the lectin-like domain. Thus, the lectin module of Fc epsilon RII not only acts as a carbohydrate-independent, isotype-specific Fc receptor but may also participate in the general regulation of B-cell growth.\r"

The coimmunoprecipitation of these proteins with the TCR is increased by treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the TCR prior to cell solubilization and immunoprecipitation. Treatment of T cells with mAbs directed against other cell surface molecules, CD2 or HLA, does not induce the association of these proteins with the TCR. The coimmunoprecipitation of gp34 and gp38 with the TCR requires solubilization in the presence of an alkylating agent, suggesting that subunit alkylation stabilizes the interaction. J.CaM1 and J.CaM2 are signal-transduction mutant cell lines derived from Jurkat. These cell lines fail to activate the inositol phospholipid second messenger pathway in response to anti-TCR mAbs. Treatment with mAb C305 (anti-TCR) induces the association of gp34 and gp38 with the TCR in J.CaM2 cells but not in J.CaM1. J.CaM1 modulates the TCR normally in response to anti-TCR antibody treatment. This observation suggests that gp34 and gp38 are involved in the signal-transduction pathway of the TCR complex rather than receptor internalization. Furthermore, since these proteins do associate with the TCR of J.CaM2, the induced association with the TCR is not a consequence of signal transduction.\r"

  ".W": "Benzylated derivatives of peptides corresponding to residues 81 through 92 of the CD4 molecule [CD4-(81-92)] inhibit human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-induced cell fusion and infection in vitro. If such peptides are to be considered as candidates in the therapy of HIV infection, it is crucial to know if the anti-HIV efficacy of CD4-based peptides is limited to blockade of infection and virus-induced cell fusion or if other stages of the viral life cycle are affected by these compounds. Accordingly, an in vitro quantitative microassay for acute HIV infection was divided into two kinetic phases corresponding to the two general stages of the viral life cycle: (i) viral infection and (ii) transmission of virus and viral protein products through cell contact or release of free virions. CEM-SS cell cultures were treated with peptide during either the infection or the transmission phase of the assay. When peptides were present during the infection phase, inhibition of syncytium formation correlated with decreased expression of viral core protein p24 and lack of infectious cell centers when cells exposed to virus were washed and replated onto fresh uninfected indicator cells. These data are consistent with complete inhibition of viral infection when peptide is present only during initial exposure to virus. Unexpectedly, parallel inhibition of syncytium formation, decreased p24 levels, and inhibition of infectious cell center formation were also seen even when peptides were added as late as 48 hr after inoculation, during the transmission period of the assay. Since viral binding and penetration are completed well before 48 hr in this assay system, CD4-(81-92) peptide derivatives appear to exert a virostatic effect on cultures already infected with HIV-1, decreasing p24 production, cytopathicity, and cell-mediated infectivity.\r"

Rapid/high isolates grow well in cell lines and induce the formation of syncytia in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, slow/low isolates do not replicate in cell lines and rarely induce syncytia in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. To understand the differences in replicative capacity of these isolates, a panel of indicator cell lines was used. These cell lines were generated for sensitive detection of HIV-1 isolates and show characteristics of T-lymphoid or monocytoid cells. As a result of infection, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression is activated. Rapid/high viruses activate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in T-cell and monocytoid indicator cell lines, whereas slow/low isolates activate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression only in monocytoid cell lines. The block in infection of T-lymphoid cells by the slow/low isolates appears to occur early in the infection cycle, prior to the production of the virally encoded tat protein. HIV-1 isolates can thus be distinguished according to target-cell tropism. Monocyte-derived cells seem to be a more general target for the various HIV-1 isolates.\r"

Commercially available electrical muscle stimulators were used for functional electrical stimulation and interfaced with reciprocating gait orthoses so that a new system has been developed. Advantages of the system include commercially available subsystems and subsystems for applications such as gait training. The system involves six electrical stimulation units worn on a belt; controlled by remote switches; and interfacing to electrodes placed over the quadriceps femoris, hamstring, and gluteal muscle groups of each leg. Four electrical stimulation units (for quadriceps femoris muscle stimulation) function primarily for stand-up and sit-down activities. Two other units (for stimulation of the hip extensor muscles) function primarily for ambulation. The system is described for use with a C7-level quadriplegic individual. The patient successfully performed over 20 repetitions of stand-up and sit down exercises with the system. An average walking distance of about 0.8 km was routinely traversed at velocities ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 km per hour. It was concluded that muscle fatigue, rather than battery power, was the functionally limiting factor for the quadriplegic patient. A recommendation is that application of the system for walking exercise should be preceded by a physical conditioning program of functional electrical stimulation. Specific medical criteria should be satisfied prior to formally prescribing the system for an individual. Finally, the steps involved in the writing of the walking system prescription are outlined.\r"

T cell-dependent in vitro immune responses can also be inhibited by anti-CD4.

Thus targeted to CD4, the gp120-specific antibody functions as an antibody to CD4; it cross-links and modulates the CD4 molecules and suppresses the activation of T cells as measured by mobilization of intracellular calcium (Ca2i+). The synergism between gp120 and anti-gp120 in blocking T cell activation occurs at low concentrations of both components. Neither gp120 nor anti-gp120 inhibits T cell activation by itself in the concentrations tested.\r"

Whether autocrine growth is stimulated by growth factor secretion in an autocrine loop or by intracellular binding of the growth factor to a receptor has been unclear. The carboxyl-terminus coding sequence for murine interleukin-3 (IL-3) was extended with an oligonucleotide encoding a four-amino acid endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cells became growth factor-independent when the modified IL-3 gene was introduced by retroviral gene transfer, despite lack of secretion of the modified IL-3. Hence autocrine growth can occur as a result of the intracellular action of a growth factor and this mechanism may be important in neoplastic and normal cells.\r"

The general requirements for CTL recognition of peptide antigens and the relation of recognition requirements to the natural variation in sequence of the HIV were investigated. For this purpose, a CTL line specific for the homologous segment of the envelope from the MN isolate of HIV-1 and restricted by the same class I major histocompatibility (MHC) molecule (Dd) as the IIIB-specific CTLs was raised from mice immunized with MN-env-recombinant vaccinia virus. The IIIB-specific and MN-specific CTLs were completely non-cross-reactive. Reciprocal exchange of a single amino acid between the two peptide sequences, which differed in 6 of 15 residues, led to a complete reversal of the specificity of the peptides in sensitizing targets, such that the IIIB-specific CTLs lysed targets exposed to the singly substituted MN peptide and vice versa. These data indicate the importance of single residues in defining peptide epitopic specificity and have implications for both the effect of immune pressure on selection of viral mutants and the design of effective vaccines.\r"

Under the age of 25 years, degeneration was uncommon in both the disc associated with the neural arch defect and the comparable disc in the control population. However, after this age, the prevalence of the disc degeneration rose in both groups, but was more marked in the spondylytic group, and this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.025). The results suggest that a neural arch defect is associated with an increased prevalence of disc degeneration, which is greater than is seen in a normal aging population.\r"

It is logical to assume that SCI patients with persistent reflux and bladder stones treated with cystolitholapaxy would be at even higher risk for kidney stones developing. Of the 898 SCI patients studied (1,793 renal units), in 14.8 percent kidney stones developed. Kidney stones occurred in 161 of 1,517 (10.6%) of nonrefluxing units. Of the 276 renal units with reflux, in 104 (37.7%) an ipsilateral stone developed. Of the 198 patients in whom a kidney stone formed, 56.6 percent managed their bladder with a Foley catheter whereas only 28 percent of 700 patients in whom a stone did not form used a Foley catheter. On evaluating 261 patients (520 renal units) with bladder stones treated with cystolitholapaxy, 62.5 percent of these patients were managed with a Foley catheter. The association between cystolitholapaxy treatment, reflux, and the formation of kidney stones was (1) in 22 of 111 (19.8%) refluxing units, an ipsilateral stone formed; (2) in 70 of 409 (17.1%) units that were nonrefluxing, stones developed; and (3) overall, in 92 (17.7%) renal units, kidney stone developed. We concluded that kidney stone development is significantly increased in the SCI patient with reflux and/or Foley catheter drainage. From these data cystolitholapaxy treatment in the presence of reflux does not appear to increase the development of kidney stones.\r"

These 24 subjects had documented ventricular fibrillation and coronary artery disease proven by cardiac catheterization or a previous electrocardiographic pattern of myocardial infarction. Thirteen of 24 (54%) had a positive treadmill stress test (greater than or equal to 1.0 mm flat or downsloping ST depression). The mean resting left ventricular ejection fraction was 43%. Nine of 11 patients (82%) who had exercise radionuclide studies performed had ischemic abnormalities (less than 5% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction with new or worsened wall motion abnormalities). Thus, 16 of 24 (67%) had a positive treadmill stress test or radionuclide ventriculogram. Only 1 of 16 (6%) had painful ischemia (p less than 0.001 relative to an even distribution of painful vs painless ischemia). Thus, survivors of cardiac arrest have a high prevalence of exercise-induced ischemia, and in most the ischemia is silent.\r"

Total cellular RNAs were extracted from four HTLV-1 positive and ten HTLV-1-negative T cell lymphomas and cell lines, and investigated for homology with cloned DNA probes specific for interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R). Tumor cells associated with clinically high grade HTLV-1-positive adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and large cell morphology (T immunoblastic lymphomas) were found to have higher levels of expression of IL-2 and TGF-beta genes than low grade T cell neoplasms (mycosis fungoides and Sezary's syndrome). High expression of IL-2R gene was restricted to Ki-1-positive lymphomas and to one ATL. Cell lines corresponding to the advanced stage of a cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) showed enhanced expression of PDGF. Therefore, high grade T cell malignancies had consistently elevated expression of growth factor/receptor (GF/R) genes. Expression of EGF-R was negligible in all T cell malignancies. An inverse relationship was found between the expression of T cell antigen receptor (differentiation antigen) and GF/R (activation antigen) genes, accounting for the frequent aberrant expression of T cell antigens in high grade T cell lymphomas. The results suggest that post-thymic T cell malignancies derived from activated T cells produce and secrete GF, conferring a growth advantage on neoplastic T cells, and correlating well with their histologic subtype and clinical behavior.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria to rats results in systemic hypotension, an increased hematocrit, and decreased numbers of circulating leukocytes (polymorphonuclear), monocytes, and platelets. These potentially lethal physiologic changes may be partially attributed to complement activation and generation of anaphylatoxins by the endotoxin (LPS). We demonstrated an elevation in the plasma levels of both C3a and C5a in LPS-treated rats. Injection of 5 micrograms C5ades Arg (rat) into rats produced effects similar to those induced by LPS, including decreased mean arterial pressure (systemic hypotension) and decreased numbers of circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, and platelets. Unlike the response to LPS, C5a did not increase the hematocrit, indicating little effect on vascular permeability at the doses used. When LPS-treated animals were pretreated with F(ab')2 fragments of rabbit anti-rat C5a, no changes were measured in the circulating cell counts compared with LPS alone; however a significant improvement in the mean arterial pressure and a decrease in hematocrit was observed. We conclude that LPS-induced (septic) shock in the rat may result, in part, from the effects of complement activation and particularly from the generation of C5a. The influence of C5a on the LPS effect in the rat appears to enhance both the hypotensive (mean arterial pressure) and vascular permeability (hematocrit) responses. These results appear to support and confirm earlier observations that anti-human C5a increased survival in a septic-shock monkey model by eliminating circulating C5a and presumably thereby reducing the effects of endotoxin on blood pressure. Our results demonstrate that C5a plays a significant role in the hemodynamic changes associated with endotoxin-induced shock. Neutralization of C5a with specific antibodies may reduce the hypotensive response to endotoxin sufficiently to prevent lethal septic shock both in animals and in man.\r"

The purposes of this study were to report the type and incidence of overuse injuries in ultraendurance triathletes and to relate training practices to injury occurrence. Data was gathered from the responses of 95 competitors (75 men, 20 women) in the 1986 Hawaii Ironman Triathlon who completed a training and medical history questionnaire. In this sample, virtually all (91%) sustained at least one soft tissue, overuse injury during the previous year's training. The area of the body most frequently involved was the back, but the most common pattern was to have multiple areas involved. Because of the consistent combinations of injuries, mechanical abnormalities, such as diminished shock absorption, may have contributed to injury. Training habits were extremely variable and not directly related to either the incidence or type of injury.\r"

We injected fibrinogen and thrombin into the cisterna magna of rats, a model of neurogenic pulmonary edema. When the vagal nerves were left intact, pulmonary edema occurred (fibrin-induced pulmonary edema) at a rate of 33%. Vagotomy at the midcervical portion increased the incidence of pulmonary edema to a rate of 100%, whereas pretreatment with atropine did not affect the incidence. These results suggested that vagal afferent nerves or nonadrenergic-noncholinergic efferent nerves played an important role in inhibiting the development of fibrin-induced pulmonary edema. Furthermore, in vagotomized and vagal nerve-intact rats pretreated with capsaicin, the incidence of pulmonary edema was 100%. Pretreatment with a substance P antagonist, [D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9]-SP, also increased the incidence to 100% in the vagal nerve-intact rats. On the other hand, intravenous administration of some neuropeptides that may be released from the capsaicin-sensitive nerves (e.g., substance P or calcitonin gene-related peptide) inhibited the development of pulmonary edema in vagotomized rats. We concluded that the vagal capsaicin-sensitive nerves exerted an inhibitory effect on the development of fibrin-induced pulmonary edema.\r"

The most quoted figure is from a 1972 National Heart and Lung Institute Task Force, which estimated 150,000 cases/year in the United States, an incidence of about 75 cases/100,000 population. No experimental study, however, has adequately addressed this issue. We were in a unique position to answer this controversy because the hospital of one of the investigators is located on an island (Las Palmas, Canary Islands, population 700,000). All patients who required mechanical ventilation (other than during anesthesia and immediate postoperative care) were admitted to the same adult intensive care unit. A prospective study to determine the incidence of ARDS was carried out over a 3-yr period. Inclusion criteria were: (1) a known predisposing illness for ARDS; (2) PaO2 less than or equal to 55 mm Hg with FIO2 greater than 0.5 with 5 cm H2O PEEP, without improvement in 24 h; (3) bilateral pulmonary infiltrates; (4) no evidence of left ventricular failure. An average of ten patients per year, representing an incidence of 1.5 cases/100,000 population, were diagnosed as having ARDS and the mortality rate was 70%. Using a more liberal clinical criterion of PaO2 less than or equal to 75 mm Hg with FIO2 greater than or equal to 0.5, 44 more patients with ARDS, representing a total incidence of 3.5 cases/100,000 population, were identified. In conclusion, the overall incidence of ARDS was 1.5 to 3.5 cases/100,000 population, an incidence that is much lower than most previously published estimates.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if epidermal growth factor (EGF), a vascular smooth muscle mitogen exhibiting systemic vasoactivity, causes constriction or dilation of the pulmonary vascular bed, this study evaluated the actions of EGF in isolated, buffer-perfused rat lungs and in isolated rat pulmonary arteries. In perfused rat lungs with baseline vasomotor tone, EGF administered at bolus doses of 10(-9) to 3 x 10(-7) M failed to exert either constrictor or dilator actions or to promote edema formation as evidenced by a constant lung wet-to-dry-weight ratio. Elevation of baseline tone with either prostaglandin (PG)F2 alpha or angiotensin II also failed to unmask an effect of EGF on pulmonary vascular resistance. In contrast to these negative observations, pretreatment with 5 x 10(-8) M EGF consistently augmented pressor responses evoked by angiotensin II. Constrictor responses to potassium chloride and to PGF2 alpha were unaffected by EGF pretreatment. In isolated rat extrapulmonary arteries, EGF provoked contraction in 40% of the preparations studied. Responsive vessels exhibited maximal EGF-induced contractions that were approximately 25% of that associated with angiotensin II and were characterized by an ED50 of 7 x 10(-8) M. Relaxant activity of EGF could not be demonstrated in isolated arterial preparations with normal resting tone or with tone elevated by addition of norepinephrine to the tissue bath. Endothelial denudation also failed to unmask contractile or relaxant effects of EGF. Similar to its actions in isolated, perfused rat lungs, EGF potentiated contractions of isolated pulmonary arteries induced by angiotensin II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Five patients were treated with 100,000-200,000 IU water miscible vitamin A orally and their daily vitamin supplements were increased to maintain normal concentrations. In four patients dark adaptation tests were repeated. Three were normal, but one patient required three further doses of water miscible vitamin A and a daily supplement of 12,000 IU vitamin A before her dark adaptation threshold returned to normal. Adolescents with cystic fibrosis are liable to develop night blindness and conjunctival xerosis, particularly if they have liver disease or fail to take daily vitamin supplements.\r"

Since 1976, the lungs of 172 of these men who died have been examined to establish the presence of asbestosis or other pneumoconiosis. The x-ray readings (ILO/UC 1971) were compared with the pathological findings. A high prevalence of false positive readings, particularly for two of the three readers, was found. False negative readings were also very prevalent. Detailed information about asbestos and other mining exposure, smoking habit, age, height, and weight were examined to determine what influence they may have had in inducing false positive findings. Other dust exposure and smoking appeared to be possible factors, whereas age and obesity were probably not. It is suggested that the term \"small irregular opacities\" requires more precise definition.\r"

Though originally introduced to handle wear and tear processes, their concepts can easily be interpreted in terms of the epidemiologic aspects of human carcinogenesis. This paper introduces the new approach and demonstrates its applicability to human cancer incidence and mortality data from Denmark and the Federal Republic of Germany. A slight simplification of the originally stochastic model provides an explicit formula for the relative risk between different populations, which predicts that this basic measure used in cancer epidemiology may have to be considered age-dependent in contrast to a widely used practice which, for convenience, postulates age-independent relative risks. A comparison with empirical data reveals that the concept of age-dependent relative risks is not inconsistent with real world examples of cancer incidence. Thus, some basic assumptions and concepts of epidemiology concerning carcinogenesis and strategies for data analysis may require reconsideration.\r"

A comparison of cDNA-derived amino acid sequences revealed that argininosuccinate lyase is highly homologous with chicken delta-crystallin, a major structural protein of the eye lens. The gene for the rat argininosuccinate lyase was cloned and its structure was determined. This gene is a single-copy gene about 14 kilobases long and is split into 16 exons. A comparison with chicken delta-crystallin genes revealed that all introns interrupt the protein-coding regions at homologous positions. This close similarity in structural organization provides strong evidence for the view of Piatigorsky et al. [Piatigorsky, J., O'Brien, W. E., Norman, B.

In both years, all rates were highest for people outside the labor market and lowest among white collar employees. The employment rate for those aged 25-44 years and treated in 1981 for alcohol psychosis, alcoholism, and alcohol intoxication--already low in 1975--had drifted further downward by 1980. Total rates of inpatient treatment for alcohol-related diagnoses generally declined but the gap between blue collar workers and white collar workers widened. We conclude that the goal for national alcohol policy, suggested by the WHO--a reduction of per capita consumption--should be combined with additional measures that will reach all social groups.\r"

Results are pooled with data from the nine other reciprocal translocations reported elsewhere, and the combined data demonstrate that male meiotic segregation is not random: whatever the type of translocation may be, the distribution of imbalances in sperm is constant, with approximately 72.0% adjacent 1, 18.5% adjacent 2, and 9.5% 3:1 segregations. The same prevalence of adjacent 1 segregations as that reported at term for translocations of paternal origin is observed. There is a strong postzygotic elimination process; for a given translocation it affects selectively the maximum-imbalance zygotes so that imbalanced segregations observed at term are always predetermined.\r"

Hearts arrested by the cardioplegic solution with no calcium or magnesium (group 1) developed a pressure (averaged over the second to eighth infusion and expressed as percent prearrest left ventricular pressure) of 6.0% +/- 0.4% during cardioplegic infusions. This solution maintained end-arrest myocardial adenosine triphosphate (13.1 +/- 1.0 nmol/mg dry weight) and phosphocreatine (21.7 +/- 2.8 nmol/mg dry weight) contents near the prearrest contents and preserved left ventricular function at 95% +/- 3% of prearrest developed left ventricular pressure at 15 minutes of reperfusion at 37 degrees C. Calcium (groups 3 and 5) increased pressure development during cardioplegic infusions (10.4% +/- 0.5% and 15.1% +/- 0.9%), depleted adenosine triphosphate (7.2 +/- 1.0 and 7.4 +/- 0.9) and phosphocreatine (13.3 +/- 1.8 and 10.7 +/- 1.5), and depressed left ventricular functional recovery (71% +/- 1% and 73% +/- 3%). Magnesium alone (group 2) decreased pressure development during cardioplegic infusions (3.0% +/- 0.3%), maintained adenosine triphosphate (15.6 +/- 0.9), augmented phosphocreatine (38.3 +/- 1.2), and preserved left ventricular function (99% +/- 4%). Magnesium added to calcium (groups 4 and 6) prevented the calcium-induced increased pressure development during cardioplegic infusions (4.0% +/- 0.5% and 6.7% +/- 0.6%), maintained adenosine triphosphate (13.6 +/- 1.4 and 14.9 +/- 0.7), augmented phosphocreatine (31.3 +/- 1.6 and 32.2 +/- 2.4), and ameliorated the depression of functional recovery (82% +/- 2% and 86% +/- 2%). These data suggest that left ventricular pressure development during arrest contributed to calcium-induced energy depletion and impairment of functional recovery and that these deleterious effects were inhibited by magnesium. The inhibitory effects of magnesium on left ventricular pressure development were rapidly reversed on reperfusion. The data support the addition\r"

Here we present evidence, based on highly refined atomic structures of the complexes of the L-arabinose-binding protein with L-arabinose, D-fucose and D-galactose, that bound water molecules, coupled with localized conformational changes, can govern substrate specificity and affinity. The atoms common to the three sugars are identically positioned in the binding site and the same nine strong hydrogen bonds are formed in all three complexes. Two hydrogen-bonded water molecules in the site contribute further to tight binding of L-arabinose but create an unfavourable interaction with the methyl group of D-fucose. Equally tight binding of D-galactose is attained by the replacement of one of the hydrogen-bonded water molecules by its--CH2OH group, coordinated with localized structural changes which include a shift and redirection of the hydrogen-bonding interactions of the other water molecule. These observations illustrate how ordered water molecules can contribute directly to the properties of proteins by influencing their interaction with ligands.\r"
