  ".W": "Patients with latent disorders of hormone response mechanism are rarely found. This paper reports a case of subclinical pseudohypoparathyroidism type II in which physiological adjustment of calcium (Ca) metabolism became insufficient only in the second half of pregnancy. A 34-year-old woman examined for a slight bruise on the head was incidentally found to have marked intracranial calcification and a full set of false teeth. From her history of past pregnancy, it was revealed that she suffered from symptoms of hypocalcemia during late gestation (serum total Ca level, 4.8-6.4 mg/dl), which disappeared spontaneously after delivery. When the woman was not pregnant, although only the total Ca level was slightly below the normal range (7.7-8.4 mg/dl), the serum ionized Ca, phosphorus (P), magnesium, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and 24,25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels, plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and urinary excretion of Ca were all normal without treatment. Intravenous infusion of 30 mg/kg EDTA-2Na resulted in marked elevation of plasma PTH associated with significant reduction of serum ionized Ca. In contrast, although her urinary excretion of phosphorous per hour was within the normal range in the basal state, she showed no proportional change in urinary phosphorous excretion with increase in urine cyclic AMP induced by administration of PTH(1-34). From these findings, she was diagnosed as having an incomplete form of pseudohypoparathyroidism Type II. This abnormality seems to be rare, but we consider that the present observations provide important information for preventive care of pregnant women and fetuses during gestation.\r"

Serum ionized calcium was elevated, and parathyroid hormone levels were low normal by the two separate radioimmunoassays. Urinary calcium excretion was markedly elevated, and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level was decreased. An extensive clinical evaluation for possible occult malignancy, myeloma, and sarcoidosis as a cause of hypercalcemia produced no positive findings. Treatment with calcitonin caused prompt normalization of serum calcium, and its discontinuation resulted in recurrence of hypercalcemia. With improvement of neuropathy, the patient started active physical therapy. We gradually discontinued calcitonin, and the patient's serum calcium remained normal during the following 11 months. We discuss difficulties in both clinical and laboratory diagnosis of hypercalcemia of immobilization in the adult patient because no specific laboratory test is available.\r"

  ".W": "The authors tested the antigenicity of human lung surfactant isolated from amniotic fluid. Mice and rabbits were immunized. Rabbit polyclonal antisera to these surfactant preparations were absorbed with normal human plasma proteins. Polyclonal antisera reacted with both high molecular weight (35 kd) surfactant apoprotein and to lower molecular weight species, both 18 kd and 9 kd. Mice were used to generate monoclonal antibodies to surfactant. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay was used to identify five monoclonal antibodies that reacted with surfactant. By Western blot analysis, all of these recognized a low molecular weight surfactant species (9 kd) that could be either SP-B or SP-C. One reacted with a 37 kd protein in the surfactant preparation, consistent with SP-A. One monoclonal antibody also recognized a higher molecular weight species (44 kd) of unknown origin. The ability of antisera and monoclonal antibodies to inhibit the functional activity of surfactant was assayed using a pulsating bubble surfactometer. Rabbit polyclonal antisera inhibited initial surface adsorption to equilibrium surface tension and increased the minimum surface tension after 1 and 5 minutes of initiation of pulsations. This inhibitory activity of the antisera was noted in divalent F(ab')2 fragments. Monovalent F(ab) fragments and control normal rabbit sera did not inhibit surfactant function in this assay. Of the anti-surfactant monoclonal antibodies that reacted with surfactant by ELISA and Western blot, three inhibited its capacity to lower surface tension on the pulsating bubble apparatus. The other two monoclonal antibodies showed no functional inhibitory activity. It is concluded that both the 35 kd SP-A and the 9 kd proteins of human surfactant are highly immunogenic and partially crossreactive. Resulting antibodies could alter the ability of surfactant to perform its physiologic function, ie, to lower surface tension.\r"

Presently, cell kinetic data can be obtained from slide-based material only with monoclonal antibodies such as Ki-67, which require the use of frozen sections and cannot be applied to archival, paraffin-embedded material. Monoclonal antibodies have recently been generated to PCNA/cyclin, a 36 kd, S-phase-associated nuclear protein. The authors investigated whether monoclonal antibody 19A2 could be used to identify proliferating cells within fixed, embedded tissue sections. Deparaffinized sections of 41 methacarn-fixed human tumors were immunostained with 19A2 using a streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase system. A semiquantitative scoring system was used to evaluate the fraction of cells that were PCNA/cyclin-positive, and this score was compared with cell kinetic data obtained from parallel flow cytometric S-phase analysis that had been performed on fresh samples of the same tumors. While there was general agreement between the slide-based, antibody-derived and the flow cytometrically-derived cell kinetic information, some discrepancies were observed. Some of the latter represented cases in which the anti-PCNA/cyclin antibody preparations demonstrated significant heterogeneity in the numbers of proliferating cells in different regions of the tumor. In other cases, a significant fraction of the positive cells corresponded to nontumor stromal and/or inflammatory cells. In these cases, the slide-based method provided more information about the tumor cell population than did the flow cytometry data. It is concluded that semiquantitative immunocytochemical analysis with anti-PCNA/cyclin antibodies may represent a simple, reproducible, yet powerful technique for the routine analysis of cell kinetic data in alcohol-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue by the surgical pathologist.\r"

In contrast, intra-epithelial S100 + DC were not found with any consistency in sclerosing cholangitis, secondary biliary cirrhosis, extrahepatic biliary atresia, or chronic liver allograft rejection, all of which are characterized by inflammatory bile duct damage. The possible relevance of DC in the pathogenesis of PBC is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "89205638\r", 
  ".W": "The passage of circulating tumor cells across vessel walls is an important step in cancer metastasis and is promoted by endothelial injury. Because Walker carcinosarcoma 256 (W256) cells generate oxygen-derived free radicals after cellular activation, the authors tested the hypothesis that these cancer cells can damage endothelial monolayers by producing such reactive oxygen species. To confirm that oxygen-derived radicals can damage endothelial cells, 3H-2-deoxyglucose-labeled human endothelial cell monolayers were exposed to xanthine oxidase in the presence of 0.2 mmol/l xanthine. 3H-2-deoxyglucose release was observed after the addition of xanthine oxidase in concentrations ranging from 6.5 x 10(-3) to 52 x 10(-3) units/ml. The extent of damage correlated with xanthine oxidase-dependent chemiluminescence (r = 0.91). Chemiluminescence assays in the presence of 5 x 10(-5) M luminol confirmed activation of the W256 cells by 1 x 10(-6) M chemotactic peptide fMLP. When fMLP-activated activated W256 cells were incubated with endothelial monolayers, concentrations of 2 x 10(6) to 6 x 10(6) W256 cells/ml were found to cause a 27% increase in the specific release of 2-deoxyglucose after a 90-minute incubation. A small but significant increase in 3H-2-deoxyglucose release also was observed in the absence of fMLP. Detection of 3H-2-deoxyglucose release in the presence of activated or unactivated tumor cells was dependent on preincubating the endothelial cell monolayer with 1 mM buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis. Under these conditions, the specific release of 3H-2-deoxyglucose was increased from nondetectable levels to 21%, in the presence of 6.5 x 10(-3) units of the oxidase. Cultured W256 cells promoted isotope release from endothelial cell monolayers when activated with phorbol myristate acetate. Catalase (1000 units/ml) inhibited the tumor cell-induced release of 3H-2-deoxyglucose by 84% whereas superoxide dismutase, even at concentrations of 1 mg/ml, had no effect. A requirement for cell contact was shown because addition of cell-free supernatants from fMLP activated tumor cells did not cause 3H-2-deoxyglucose release and because pretreatment of W256 cells with 1 microM cytochalasin B inhibited their ability to promote isotope release even while increasing tumor cell-generated chemiluminescence threefold. Electron microscopy revealed that fewer cytochalasin B-treated W256 cells were attached to the endothelial cell monolayer than in untreated controls. It is concluded that the W256 tumor cells can damage endothelial cells directly via a mechanism involving production of reactive oxygen species.\r"

Purified soluble phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in concentrations ranging from 1000 to 20,000 units/ml, was injected intra-articularly. Histologic parameters examined were cell and protein content of synovial fluid, subsynovial cellular infiltration, synovial lining cell hyperplasia, bone erosion, and peri-articular soft tissue infiltration. Single intra-articular injections of PLA2 resulted in an acute inflammatory infiltrate of the subsynovium with maximal changes seen 2 to 6 hours after injection. Acute inflammatory changes were dose-dependent. Joints injected repeatedly at 24-hour intervals showed prominent synovial lining cell hyperplasia, maximal at 96 hours. Human synovial and snake venom PLA2s were equipotent at inducing both the acute and chronic articular changes. These changes were not seen in joints injected with inactivated PLA2. It is concluded that soluble PLA2 causes time- and dose-dependent acute inflammatory changes after a single intra-articular injection and synovial lining cell hyperplasia in response to repeated exposure to PLA2. The experimental proliferative synovitis in this model may correlate with features of acutely inflammed joints bathed in synovial fluids containing high levels of PLA2 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

There is little information, however, on whether the detection of HPV DNA by in situ hybridization can be affected by the way in which the tissue is fixed. To address this question, the authors compared the hybridization signal using this technique under low stringency conditions for several genital condylomata containing HPV 6 or 11 that were randomly subdivided and fixed in various fixatives for 16 hours. In all cases, the largest proportion of cells with koilocytotic atypia that had detectable HPV DNA was in buffered formalin-fixed tissue (80%), followed by tissue fixed in unbuffered formalin (70%), Hartman's solution (40%), and Bouin's solution (10%). After a high stringency wash, the greatest decrease in the overall hybridization signal was with tissue fixed in Bouin's solution; a minimal decrease was noted with tissue fixed in buffered formalin. Fixation in Bouin's solution for 2 hours gave in situ hybridization results comparable with buffered formalin fixation but with poorer cytologic detail. It is concluded that, of the fixatives studied, buffered formalin is superior for the detection of HPV DNA by in situ hybridization analysis.\r"

In all but two of the tumors epitopes corresponding to antigenic determinants located on the cytoplasmic side of the AchR were identified. From eight thymomas cell lines were established that have been kept in culture for up to 6 months. The cultured cells expressed the same AchR-epitopes as did the primary tumors. During early passages the percentage of epithelial cells positive for the AchR epitopes approximately mirrored the percentage of positive cells in the original tumors. With passaging the relative number of positive cells usually declined but in some cultures an increase was observed. Three cell lines that showed extensive staining with an MAb against the AchR were radiolabeled to characterize the antigen. From protein extracts of these three cell lines proteins of 45 kd and 156 kd molecular weight (MW) were precipitated. These proteins are different from other proteins described in the context of both thymomas and MG. The negative reactivity with MAb against other epitopes of the alpha-subunit, especially against the main immunogenic region (MIR), speaks in favor of membrane-associated proteins of only limited crossreactivity to the AchR. A previous study found an almost exclusive occurrence of these AchR-epitopes in thymomas associated with MG, but not in other thymomas of similar histologic type. The expression of the proteins described here could therefore play a role in the triggering of the autoimmune process against the AchR of the motor, endplate in MG patients.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the healing process after permanent coronary artery occlusion in a canine model, the authors used polarized light microscopy. At 6 weeks after occlusion the scar collagen was mainly type I. Some regions of the scar contained a fiber lattice which appeared to be type III collagen. Collagen orientation was measured using a universal stage; subepicardial collagen was obliquely aligned (-14.0 +/- 3.5 degrees), midmyocardial collagen circumferentially aligned (1.4 +/- 0.4 degrees) and subendocardial collagen obliquely aligned (12.7 +/- 2.1 degrees). The molecular organization of scar collagen increased from 1 to 6 weeks after occlusion. Muscle cell disarray, similar to that in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was seen in the viable muscle adjacent to the scar. Such abnormal organization extended as far as 1 cm from the edge of the scar. The ability of polarized light microscopy to assess these different parameters from histologic sections demonstrates that it is a useful adjunct to other methods commonly used to study myocardial healing.\r"

TGF-beta was detected in both benign and malignant tumors, but was not detected in normal brain. In contrast, TGF-alpha was highly conserved in its expression, occurring predominantly in malignant compared with benign or normal brain tissue (P less than 0.0001). In malignant gliomas, glioblastomas contained 76% TGF-alpha reactivity (immunoreactive product), and anaplastic types contained 85% reactivity. Benign gliomas contained only 13% TGF-alpha reactivity. These findings support the role of TGF-alpha as an oncoprotein marker in brain neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine the natural history and pathogenesis of the acute arthritis induced by inoculation of a viable Chlamydia trachomatis biovar (mouse pneumonitis agent or MoPn) in C57Bl/6 mice. Immunologically naive (previously unsensitized) mice as well as mice immunized against Chlamydia (MoPn) by vaginal infection were employed. Both intravenous and intraarticular inoculations were employed. No arthritis developed after intravenous injections of MoPn although statistically significant antibody titers and splenic enlargement ensued. Intra-articular inoculation into knee joints produced a definite arthritis of 7 to 10 days duration marked by granulocyte and mononuclear cell infiltration of the joint and vacuolated synovial macrophages that stained heavily for chlamydial antigen by immunoperoxidase technique. Statistically significant increases in articular acute and chronic inflammation (P less than 0.02 were observed in previously sensitized, but not unsensitized, female mice at 2 but not 7 days after intra-articular chlamydial challenge. Chlamydiae were isolated from injected joints up to day 5, but not at day 10, after challenge. Chlamydial antigen disappeared rapidly from knee joints between day 10 and 15 after challenge. Electron micrographs demonstrated vacuolated synovial cells of the macrophage type, many of which contained degenerating chlamydial elementary bodies. Reticulate and intermediate bodies also were seen but were far less frequent than degenerating elementary bodies. Unaltered elementary bodies were difficult to identify beyond day 2 after articular inoculation. Thus, it appears likely that intra-articular chlamydial survival is shorter than the duration of the arthropathy. This may have important implications in attempts to identify chlamydiae in human joints in Reiter's Disease.\r"

Statistical analysis of silver-stained NORs revealed four times as many in CHP 212 cells compared with HTB 10 cells. No difference was observed in the ribosomal RNA synthesis between the two cell lines. The caryotype index was 1.2 for CHP 212 and 1.0 for HTB 10 cells. The number of chromosomes carrying NORs and the quantity of ribosomal genes was found to be the same for the two cell lines. Doubling time of CHP 212 cells was 20 hours compared with 54 hours for HTB 10 cells. In CHP 212 cells bindering of cell duplication by serum deprivation induced a progressive lowering (calculated at 48, 72, and 96 hours) of the quantity of silver-stained interphasic NORs. Recovery of duplication by new serum addition induced, after 24 hours, an increase of the quantity of silver-stained interphasic NORs up to control levels. In the light of available data, these results indicate that the quantity of interphasic NORs is strictly correlated only to the growth rate of the cell.\r"

The frequency and severity of dental fluorosis among 884 7-14-year-old children were measured by two dentists utilizing Dean's Index. Data regarding residential and fluoride history were obtained from the parents of participants. Among the Newburgh residents, the prevalence of dental fluorosis (very mild to moderate) varied from a low of 5 per cent for the 9-10-year-old group to a high of 9.4 per cent for 11-12-year-olds. Except for the 13-14-year-old group, children in non-fluoridated Kingston had the lowest dental fluorosis prevalence rates. A comparison of Dean's Community Fluorosis Indices to the 1955 baseline data obtained from studies conducted after 10 years of fluoridation in Newburgh revealed no changes of consequence among Newburgh residents. However, the changes are apparent for Kingston residents, indicating the availability of fluorides in non-fluoridated areas. The increased risk for dental fluorosis for Kingston residents appears to be from the use of fluoride tablets. An analysis of dental caries data revealed that caries prevalence declined substantially in both fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas.\r"

During August 1986-July 1987, a total of 2,453 of 23,238 death certificates were returned to the certifiers for additional information, not including those returned in a tobacco use study. More than one-half (56.1 per cent) resulted in new and more specific underlying cause-of-death data. Only 5.2 per cent of the queries were unanswered. One probable result of Oregon's program is that the state has the highest percentage of liver cirrhosis and disease deaths attributed to alcohol abuse in the United States. Nationally, 41.7 per cent of all liver disease and cirrhosis deaths in 1984 were listed as due to alcohol compared to 82.4 per cent in Oregon. The state's total liver cirrhosis and disease death rate (12.0 per 100,000 population) is only marginally higher than the United States rate (11.6). The query program also serves to locate maternal deaths that would otherwise not be reported, as well as to provide more accurate cause-of-death statistics in general.\r"

These two variants, fibroplasia and atheronecrosis, were both found to increase with age and to correlate with each other from one autopsy to the next after age adjustment. Despite the correlation of these two variables among individuals, the measures of fibroplasia and atheronecrosis did not correlate with each other across population groupings. A positive correlation of this kind between some populations was canceled by an inverse correlation between other populations. For example, Manila was the population with the greatest intimal fibroplasia in the coronary arteries at each age, and Sao Paulo was among those with the least intimal fibroplasia. Nevertheless, Sao Paulo showed the greatest tendency toward atheronecrosis, while Manila was among the populations with the least tendency toward atheronecrosis. The possibility arises, therefore, that the subjects from Sao Paulo were exposed to a different assortment of etiologic agents than were the subjects from Manila, and that their arteries, therefore, manifested a different kind of atherosclerosis.\r"

Case restaurants were facilities with a reported foodborne outbreak between January 1, 1986 and March 31, 1987 (N = 28). Two control restaurants with no reported outbreaks during this period were matched to each case restaurant on county health district and date of routine inspection (N = 56). Data from the routine inspection that preceded the outbreak (for case restaurants) or the date-matched routine inspection (for control restaurants) were abstracted from computerized inspection records. Case restaurants had a significantly lower mean inspection score (83.8 on a 0 to 100 point scale) than control restaurants (90.9). Restaurants with poor inspection scores and violations of proper temperature controls of potentially hazardous foods were, respectively, five and ten times more likely to have outbreaks than restaurants with better results. Although this study demonstrates that Seattle-King County's routine inspection form can successfully identify restaurants at increased risk of foodborne outbreaks, it also illustrates that more emphasis on regulation and education is needed to prevent outbreaks in restaurants with poor inspection results.\r"

GAO found that the value of combined benefits can exceed the cost of the United States Department of Agriculture's Thrifty Food Plan. Key assumptions underlying GAO's methodology are challenged, and an alternate method is applied. The new results contradict GAO's conclusions and suggest that Boston food costs exceed the combined value of benefits that AFDC households may receive, although participation in multiple food assistance programs is more beneficial than receipt of benefits from single programs. The authors conclude that food stamps and AFDC benefits indexed to actual costs of living are needed to meet the food needs of low-income families in Boston.\r"

Black husbands were at greater risk of spouse homicide victimization than Black wives or White spouses of either sex. The risk of victimization was greater for spouses in interracial than in intraracial marriages and increased as age differences between spouses increased. From 1976 through 1985, the risk of spouse homicide declined by more than 45.0 per cent for both Black husbands and wives but remained relatively stable for White husbands and wives. Demographic patterns in the risk of spouse homicide were similar to those reported for nonfatal spouse abuse suggesting that the causes of spouse homicide and nonfatal spouse abuse may be similar.\r"

The physician estimated gestational age distribution exhibits even number digit preference and a distinct clustering at the 40-week value. The DLNM distribution appears more smoothly distributed but with a more pronounced post-term tail. An exact agreement between the two methods is observed in only 27.9 per cent of the cases. A 1.7 week mean difference between the methods indicates a systematic underestimation by physician reported gestational age when compared to that calculated from the DLNM, potentially biasing gestational age distributions when the physician estimate is substituted for cases with a missing DLNM. Over 8 per cent of cases 20+ weeks by DLNM are estimated as less than 20 weeks by the physician. This underestimation has important implications for the completeness of reporting of fetal deaths on vital records and the comparability of fetal death rates. Further, it may limit investigations of the completeness of reporting of less than 500 gram live births.\r"

Employment status and type of employment were not found to predict mortality risk among women. Contrary to the multiple roles hypothesis, there was virtually no impact upon mortality of increasing numbers of children among employed women, except possibly among single working parents. The major impact of children was felt by housewives who had significantly elevated risks when a child was present in the home or when they had four or more children. Neither the number of children nor the presence of a child in the home affected mortality risk of men. Controlling for a variety of factors thought to be related to mortality in a logistic regression analysis did not change the foregoing relation.\r"

Based on observed patterns of use, intervention strategies need to begin in the elementary school years and target both males and females equally.\r"

These views are less negative than those of organized medicine.\r"

In addition to its internationally recognized advances in public health, considerable progress has been made in health care delivery by expanding curative medical services through training more personnel and building more facilities to fulfill a commitment to free universal health coverage. The very uneven quality of medical care is the leading problem facing curative medicine now. Underlying factors include the difficulty of adequately training the greatly increased number of new physicians. Misdiagnosis and mismanagement continue to be major problems. The curative medical system is not well coordinated with the preventive sector. Recent innovations include initiation of a \"medicina integral\" residency, similar to family practice. Despite its inadequacies and the handicaps of war and poverty, the Nicaraguan curative medical system has made important progress.\r"

The trachea was intubated with an oral tracheal tube with high-volume low-pressure cuff. The intracuff pressure was within the normal safe range recommended by the manufacturer. However, the patient developed tracheal dilatation on the second day after intubation. The trachea was extubated on the 15th day, and it was noticed 48 hours later that the patient was developing a tracheal stenosis at the site of the previous dilatation. The stenosis was so severe that the patient underwent resection-anastomosis surgery of his stenotic tracheal segment 2 months after extubation. It may be preferable in patients with Mounier-Kuhn syndrome who require mechanical ventilation to intubate the trachea with an uncuffed tube and to pack the throat to decrease the chances of gas leak and inhalation.\r"

The temperature of the sensors was set at 44 degrees C during calibration and maintained throughout all tests. Resting tcPO2 was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in patients than in controls. In all subjects tcPO2 decreased and tcPCO2 increased during compression. Patients showed a highly significant increase (p less than 0.001) in tcPCO2 during and after the treatment. Results of this study indicate that the symptomatic improvement, in peripheral vascular disease and wound healing following IPC, is not due to improved skin perfusion or enhancement of oxygenation and CO2 removal.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of lowering serum triglyceride levels were investigated among 44 elderly hypertriglyceridemic patients with risk factors for stroke, reduced cerebral perfusion, and a history compatible with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Patients were randomly assigned to either treatment with gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering agent, or control conditions. Subjects in both groups were instructed to follow a diet recommended for lowering serum lipid levels, while the treatment group was additionally administered 600 mg daily of gemfibrozil. Subjects assigned to the treatment group (n = 22) showed significant reductions in serum triglyceride levels (p less than .0005). Control subjects (n = 22) did not show any significant changes in serum triglyceride levels. There were also no significant changes in total cholesterol levels in either group. Analyses of values for mean bihemispheric gray matter cerebral blood flow measured by the xenon 133 inhalation method and cognitive scores tested by the Cognitive Capacity Screening Examination indicated that gemfibrozil-treated patients maintained significantly higher levels of cerebral perfusion and cognitive performance than untreated controls did. Regression analyses for different treatment intervals indicated that both cerebral blood flow and cognition showed linear improvements that correlated directly with the duration of treatment. Lowering triglyceride levels in hyperlipidemic subjects appears to benefit cerebral perfusion and cognitive performance after four to six months.\r"

  ".W": "Although a relationship has been suggested between abstinence from alcohol and improvement in left ventricular (LV) function, no long-term studies in large groups of patients have been done to confirm this impression or to demonstrate an effect on survival. To address these questions, the authors analyzed the outcome in 105 male patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy and 64 control male patients with nonalcoholic dilated cardiomyopathy. Survival data were available for all patients. The correlates of survival were assessed via the Cox proportional hazards model. Variables considered were age, race, drinking pattern (current drinker versus former drinker), presence of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and diabetes, and these echo variables: left atrial (LA) size, posterior wall thickness, LV end diastolic dimension (LVDD), minimal E point septal separation, wall motion, presence of incomplete mitral leaflet closure (IMLC) or low cardiac output, and the ratio of relative wall thickness to LVDD. The two study groups were comparable with respect to all echocardiographic variables. At a mean follow-up of 17.2 months +/- 12.1 months, 42.85% of the alcoholics and 41% of the nonalcoholics had died. Nonsurvival in the alcoholic group was significantly associated with only two factors: an increased LVDD and the presence of IMLC. The drinking pattern was not significantly associated with survival. By contrast, in the nonalcoholics,the variables most closely related to survival were LVDD, low cardiac output, increasing age, and abnormal wall motion. Therefore: (1) the risk factors in alcoholic and nonalcoholic cardiomyopathy are similar although IMLC appears to be a relatively specific prognostic factor for alcoholic cardiomyopathy and (2) abstinence from alcohol does not appear to improve survival.\r"

Clinical characteristics that occurred more frequently in patients with NCA were: nonexertional pain, pain to the left of the sternum, sharp pain, associated palpitations, absence of typical relief with sublingual nitroglycerin, pain commencing less than one week or more than ten years prior to coronary angiography, a normal electrocardiogram, and negative results from a treadmill stress test or from thallium scintigraphy. However, none of these clinical features, either singly or in combination, could be used to identify the patients with NCA with certainty.\r"

In the present paper the author analyzes the crossover studies published after November, 1985, in two general and two specialist journals (New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, Angiology, British Heart Journal). Of 73 papers only 23 (32%) consider the possibility of carryover effects. Of these latter papers 12 (16%) perform statistical tests for these effects. The results of these tests were shown in only 7 papers (10%). It is concluded that there is a discrepancy between the statistical recommendations and the data presented in the literature.\r"

Four-week-old vitamin D-deficient chicks were divided into four groups: Group A served as the normal group and received subcutaneous injections of cholecalciferol; Groups B and C were vitamin D-deficient hearts but perfused differently; Group D received daily subcutaneous injections of 5 micrograms of 1,25(OH)2D3. When the isolated spontaneously beating hearts (modified Langendorff preparation) were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution containing a calcium concentration of 2.5mM, the myocardial contractility of the vitamin D-deficient hearts was significantly increased when compared with group A. After the isolated heart had beaten for one hour, the myocardial contractility in the vitamin D-deficient hearts was found to decline to significantly lower values. Presacrifice administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 improved cardiac performance. Vitamin D deficiency resulted in an enhanced rate of decline of the intracellular high-energy phosphorus compounds. No differences were found in the microscopic study. These observations suggest that vitamin D has a role in cardiac function.\r"

Q absorption and hydrolysis to QT is rapid with peak Q and QT concentrations occurring one and two hours postdose, respectively. Peak plasma QT concentrations were approximately fourfold higher than those of Q (923 vs 207 ng/mL following 40-mg Q). Dose-proportional QT area under the curve and dose-independent percent of dose excreted in urine as QT demonstrate that the extent of Q conversion to QT is constant over the dose range studied. Q and QT were eliminated from plasma with apparent half-lives of 0.8 and 1.9 hours and apparent plasma clearances of 1,850 and 220 mL/min, respectively, over the 2.5- to 80-mg dose range. Following oral 14C-Q, 61% and 37% of radiolabel was recovered in urine and feces, respectively. Q plus QT accounted for 46% of radioactivity circulating in plasma and 56% of that excreted in urine. Metabolism to compounds other than QT is not extensive. Two diketopiperazine metabolites of Q have been identified in plasma and urine, with approximately 6% of an administered dose excreted in urine as each of these metabolites. Peak plasma concentrations of these metabolites are similar to that of Q, and each is eliminated rapidly with a half-life of approximately one hour. Urinary excretion profiles indicate the presence of other minor metabolites. In summary, the absorption of Q and conversion to QT is rapid and dose-proportional, subsequent clearance of both Q and QT is independent of dose, and metabolism to compounds other than QT is not extensive.\r"

A total of 25 patients had evaluable data after receiving single doses (2.5, 5, or 10 mg) of quinapril. Following acute dosing, favorable hemodynamic changes began within thirty minutes to one hour and usually reached a maximum within four hours post-dose. Nineteen evaluable patients who had responded to acute therapy received an additional sixteen weeks of chronic treatment with quinapril in individualized dosage regimens. Hemodynamic responses did not differ markedly between acute and chronic therapy. Favorable hemodynamic responses were maintained or enhanced following chronic doses of 5 to 30 mg/day (given either once daily or in divided doses). The most frequent doses were 10-15 mg/day in divided doses. The mean maximum percent changes in four primary hemodynamic parameters after chronic dosing (compared with baseline) were: mean arterial blood pressure, -3.9%; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, -39.7%; cardiac output, +31.7%; and systemic vascular resistance, -25.2%. Changes in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure did not result in clinically significant bradycardia or hypotention. Overall, quinapril produced both acute and sustained beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients whose congestive heart failure was not clinically controlled with diuretics and digitalis.\r"

The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 62 +/- 11% at rest and 74 +/- 13% after exercise (p less than 0.001). Seven of 29 patients had an abnormal RV response and 6 had an abnormal LV response. Eight had abnormal wall motion after exercise. A total of 12/29 patients (41%) had one or more abnormalities. The mean left-sided regurgitant fraction before exercise was 27 +/- 17% in 21/29 patients (72%) and 31 +/- 21% after exercise (p = ns). An additional 5 patients (17%) developed left-sided regurgitation after exercise. These findings indicate that wall motion abnormalities and abnormal RVEF and LVEF responses to exercise occur in symptomatic MVP patients. In addition, 26/29 (89.6%) had left-sided regurgitation after exercise. Since the presence of a murmur did not correlate with the presence of mitral regurgitation by RNA, then symptomatic patients with MVP should have first-pass exercise RNA to assess the presence of regurgitation at rest and after exercise. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in MVP patients with systolic murmurs or with regurgitation. Since patients without murmurs can have regurgitation, further study is necessary to determine the need for endocarditis prophylaxis in these patients.\r"

The DR was found to correlate with the inhibition of the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) by platelets (r = 0.66, P less than 0.001). Therefore, the DR was used for laboratory monitoring of the ASA effect. The study included 63 arteriosclerotic patients--patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), or cerebrovascular insufficiency (CVI) -- who were analyzed before treatment and after receiving ASA in an individually controlled dosage. Before treatment the authors found an increased level of MDA and a longer euglobulin clot lysis time in patients when compared with healthy volunteers (n = 16). Extremely different doses of ASA were required to normalize initially elevated MDA levels in patients. Normalization of the MDA level corresponds to a DR of at least 50% (in comparison with 0-13% without treatment). When judging the ASA dose individually from the 50% DR, the authors demonstrated that there were no differences in the levels of cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoids between healthy volunteers (n = 16) and arteriosclerotic patients receiving 100-250 mg (n = 18), 500 mg (n = 17), or 750-1500 mg ASA per day (n = 6). Thus, their results support the idea of using individually controlled ASA as the most promising way of resolving the \"aspirin dilemma\" and provide a simple and reproducible method of measuring the biological effect of ASA.\r"

Polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes stimulation is one of the known sources for oxygen free radicals. It has been suggested that oxygen free radicals depress the excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. It is possible that a decrease in the myocardial contractility in heart failure might be due to an increased oxygen-free-radical-producing activity of PMN leukocytes. The authors studied, therefore, the release of oxygen free radicals, as measured by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence activity, from the PMN leukocytes in dogs with heart failure due to aortic stenosis. Hemodynamics and phagocytic activity of PMN leukocytes were studied in 6 control dogs and 6 dogs with aortic stenosis of six to nine months' duration. There was a significant decrease in the index of myocardial contractility and an increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in dogs with aortic stenosis, suggesting left ventricular failure in these dogs. Although there was a tendency for a decrease in the cardiac index in dogs with aortic stenosis, the decrease was not significant. Phagocytic activity of PMN leukocytes in blood was studied in control dogs and dogs with aortic stenosis. Phagocytosis was initiated by addition of opsonized zymosan and chemiluminescence was monitored by use of a luminometer. The peak chemiluminescence activity of the PMN leukocytes in blood of dogs with heart failure was about threefold greater than that in the blood from control dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test the hypothesis that such patients have clinically unimportant heart disease, the authors evaluated the records of 213 consecutive men in whom mitral regurgitation had been found by pulsed Doppler. In 95 patients (group I) mitral regurgitation was audible, whereas in the other 118, it was not. In 97 patients with inaudible mitral regurgitation there were no structural mitral valve abnormalities by 2D echo. This group of 97 patients (group II) was defined as having unexpected Doppler mitral regurgitation. In group II patients there was a high prevalence of hypertension (50%), congestive heart failure (44%), alcohol abuse (46%), diabetes (27%), coronary artery disease (63%), and atrial fibrillation (13%). The following variables were distributed similarly in groups I and II: survival time, age, presence of congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease, left ventricular short-axis end diastolic and end systolic dimensions, E point septal separation, and the severity of dyssynergy. Atrial fibrillation was more common in group I (p = 0.017), and group I patients had a higher Quetelet's Index (weight/height squared) (p = 0.03). In group II, the factors most closely related to survival were the presence of dyssynergy, of atrial fibrillation, or of congestive heart failure. Although no group II patient had endocarditis or required mitral valve replacement, their survival was markedly decreased compared with people of similar age in the general population. The majority of cardiogenic deaths in group II patients were due to coronary artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patient attributed these episodes to a \"food allergy\" as they occurred during or immediately following meals. The only medication the patient was using was inhaled epinephrine (Primatene MistR), two puffs, ten to twenty times a day. Subsequent evaluation revealed that the patient had sarcoidosis. Differential diagnosis of the facial swelling included food-related angioedema, sarcoid parotitis, or catecholamine-induced sialadenosis, which is a rare complication associated with excessive catecholamine administration. A gallium-67 citrate scan demonstrated abnormal pulmonary and hilar uptake of the radiotracer, but not lacrimal or parotid gland uptake, strongly arguing against sarcoidosis as the cause of the facial swelling. Episodes of swelling completely abated when the patient stopped using the epinephrine inhalers. At 5 months of follow-up she has had two recurrent episodes of facial swelling, each time associated with the use of inhaled epinephrine. Thus this patient's facial swelling most likely represents catecholamine-induced sialadenosis. This adverse drug reaction, associated with excessive use of inhaled catecholamines must be kept in mind in patients who abuse inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists and report parotid swelling.\r"

It has been shown to be effective in the management of asthma and to attenuate exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 12 ragweed-sensitive subjects known to respond to inhaled ragweed antigen. On two study days, four to ten days apart, ragweed challenges were performed using a standard protocol 30 minutes after a single dose (two puffs of 2 mg/puff) of either active drug or placebo. The PD20 (20% fall in FEV1) for each treatment day was compared by parametric and nonparametric 2-period crossover analyses. Baseline FEV1 pre-drug and post-drug administration did not differ significantly between study days. On the nedocromil day, the mean +/- SD for log PD20 was 2.25 +/- 0.561 and on the placebo day, 1.73 +/- 1.048 (P = 0.04). There were no side effects associated with either treatment. These results demonstrate that nedocromil is effective in shifting the stimulus response curve to inhaled antigen in some ragweed-sensitive subjects. Its wide spectrum of efficacy against bronchoprovocation suggests it is useful in the treatment of hyperreactive airway disorders.\r"

In addition, babies fed with these formulae during the first months of life do not show antibodies to betalactoglobulin (BLG). These data suggest that these hydrolysates are not antigenic, therefore they have been employed as CM substitutes for the management of infants with CM allergy (CMA). We report five exclusively breast fed infants aged 3 to 8 months (median age = 5 mo) with IgE-mediated CMA, who experienced allergic reactions when they were first fed (median age = 5 months) with a small amount of CM whey protein hydrolysate (Alfa-Re, Nestle). Family history was positive for atopy in 3/5 babies. All infants had atopic dermatitis during breastfeeding, positive skin tests, and RAST to CM proteins as well as to Alfa-Re. Total IgE levels ranged from 45 to 2,990 U/mL. These data show that Alfa-Re, a CM whey protein trypsin hydrolysate, can trigger severe allergic reactions in children with CMA and it should be employed with great caution as a CM substitute in the management of CMA.\r"

The rate for whites was higher in the West (.263) than in the Northeast (.180), South (.149), or North Central Region (.108). During 1981-84 rates remained higher for blacks in the Northeast and North Central Regions than other regions and higher for whites in the West than elsewhere. Most deaths from asthma at 5-34 years of age from 1979-84 in the USA occurred at hospitals (70% of blacks, 77% of whites for the 40 states reporting this detail on death certificates). Rates of discharge from hospitals after admission for the treatment of asthma at 5-34 years of age have also been much higher for blacks than for whites from 1979-86. These rates have been highest in the Northeast and North Central Region for both blacks and whites. Accordingly, neither failure to reach a hospital nor lack of hospitalization can account for regional and racial differences in asthma mortality rates. Median household incomes have been lower for blacks than whites, and unemployment rates have been higher for blacks than whites. From 1980-84 unemployment rates for blacks were highest in the North Central Region. Economic factors may account in part for racial and regional differences in mortality from asthma.\r"

Adrenergic agonists with beta-2 properties may enhance peripheral vasodilation and may prove less beneficial during CPR. The purpose of this study was to compare epinephrine (E), an alpha-1,2; beta-1,2 agonist, versus norepinephrine, an alpha-1,2; beta-1 agonist, on myocardial hemodynamics during CPR. Twenty swine were instrumented for pressure, arterial and coronary sinus oxygen content (CAO2 and CCSO2, respectively), and myocardial blood flow measurements using tracer microspheres. CAO2, CCSO2, myocardial blood flow, myocardial oxygen delivery (MDO2) and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2), extraction ratio, and aortic diastolic pressure were determined during normal sinus rhythm and during CPR following a ten-minute arrest. After three minutes of CPR, the animals were allocated to receive either norepinephrine 0.08 mg/kg (n = 5), norepinephrine 0.12 mg/kg (n = 5), norepinephrine 0.16 mg/kg (n = 5), or epinephrine 0.20 mg/kg (n = 5). One minute after drug administration, all hemodynamic parameters were again determined. Three and one half minutes after drug administration defibrillation was attempted. A Newman-Keuls multiple comparison procedure was used to compare differences following drug administration. During CPR, aortic diastolic pressure averaged less than 13 mm Hg, and myocardial blood flow averaged less than 6 mL/min/100 g. All doses of norepinephrine and epinephrine improved all hemodynamic parameters over those seen during CPR. The two highest doses of norepinephrine significantly improved extraction ratio compared with norepinephrine 0.08 mg/kg (P = .04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Maintenance of normal temperatures in this setting is essential and requires the use of rapid and efficient blood-warming devices. The optimal design of such units should include a low priming volume, large heat transfer area, low pressure drop, the ability to operate at high flow rates, and the capability of warming blood from 4 to 32 C, or higher, without untoward effects. We have previously formulated a theoretic model for blood warmers and described a measure of the intrinsic efficiency of these devices, the apparent thermal clearance (VT,cl). In this study, we tested four different types of commercially available blood warmers (the single-coil immersion heater; the single-channel dry wall electric heater; the multichannel countercurrent heat exchanger; and the single-channel, countercurrent heat exchanger) and determined the apparent thermal clearance values using saline and packed red blood cells. The results indicate that only the single-channel countercurrent unit is efficient enough to meet the established requirements. The apparent thermal clearance provides a useful and rigorous means for comparing and evaluating blood-warming devices.\r"

The study compared IV chlorpromazine against IV meperidine with dimenhydrinate. Entry criteria were emergency department patients from 18 to 60 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of common or classic migraine headache. After informed consent was obtained, an IV line with normal saline was established, and a bolus of 5 mL/kg was administered. Patients were randomized into two groups: chlorpromazine and meperidine with dimenhydrinate. The chlorpromazine group received a bolus injection of 5 mL normal saline placebo followed by 0.4 mL/kg chlorpromazine solution (0.1 mg/kg). The chlorpromazine was repeated every 15 minutes as needed up to a total of three doses. The meperidine with dimenhydrinate group received 5 mL dimenhydrinate solution (25 mg) followed by 0.04 mL/kg meperidine (0.4 mg/kg). Again, the meperidine solution was repeated in the same dosage every 15 minutes as needed up to a total of three doses. If response was inadequate 15 minutes after the third dose, the sequence was broken, and the other medication given. Blood pressure and response were assessed at 15-minute intervals for one hour. Pain was assessed by both visual and verbal analogue scales every 15 minutes.

Options for access for prehospital care were reviewed and categorized: call 911, call toll-free telephone number, call HMO office or primary physician, go to the nearest HMO-affiliated hospital, and go to the nearest hospital. Of the 16 respondents, 15 HMOs responsible for 99% of the total HMO enrollees advised their subscribers to contact their HMO office or primary physician or to call a toll-free number in the case of an emergency. No HMO advised use of the 911 access as a first response for an emergency. Only two HMO brochures, responsible for 7% of the total HMO enrollees, recommended that 911 access be used. These data suggest that HMO enrollees may not be adequately informed regarding proper use of 911 and the emergency medical services system.\r"

  ".W": "In a follow-up study conducted one year after a previous report, we found that 7.8% of 126 patients with critical illness or injury were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1987 as compared with 3.0% of 203 similar patients in 1986. In the earlier study all patients with infection (six) were confined to a narrow age range (25 to 34 years old) and were trauma presentations. However, in the follow-up study, infections were found in all age groups under 45 years of age (nine) as well as in 3.4% of patients with nontrauma presentations. Infection rates among patients between the ages of 25 and 34 presenting with penetrating trauma remained over 18% during both study periods. While emergency health care providers may have inadvertently interpreted the results of the first study as indicating that the need for infection control precautions could be restricted to young victims of trauma, the follow-up study clearly indicates that appropriate protective measures must be taken on all patients requiring resuscitative measures regardless of age or clinical presentation, particularly in emergency facilities within similar locations.\r"

Toxoplasma antibody testing is rarely performed in most emergency departments; as a result, toxoplasmosis is diagnosed infrequently. We obtained Toxoplasma IgG IFA titers on ED patients who had mononucleosis testing performed to determine the frequency of toxoplasmosis in this population. Two hundred sixty patients were included in our study. Eleven (4.2%) had a positive mononucleosis test, and 14 (5.4%) had a positive Toxoplasma titer. In the detection of toxoplasmosis, Toxoplasma IgG titers of 1:1,024 or greater have been shown to be a sensitive means of detecting infection in the first six months. Further testing with IgM titers is needed to establish a positive diagnosis when necessary. We found more patients with elevated Toxoplasma IgG titers than with positive heterophil antibody titers in an ED population tested for mononucleosis over a two-year period. We conclude that toxoplasmosis may be as common as mononucleosis in our ED and that clinicians should consider this pathogen when working up patients with appropriate symptoms.\r"

Ataxia, which did not occur in adults, was a frequent presenting sign of intoxication in children. Fifty-nine percent of patients who ingested only pine oil cleaner developed central nervous system depression, and three of these developed coma. Three of five children and three of 17 adults developed acute hydrocarbon pneumonitis. Unlike aspiration pneumonitis, which follows petroleum distillate ingestion, chemical pneumonitis from pine oil cleaner may occur from gastrointestinal absorption of pine oil and deposition in lung tissue. However, recovery from pneumonitis in our patients was typically rapid and complete. Only two adults developed secondary bacterial pneumonia; no patient died. Ingestion of pine oil cleaner was rarely life threatening; most patients needed only gastrointestinal decontamination and minimal supportive care.\r"

Whereas S intermedius is recognized as flora and pathogen of dogs, it has never been isolated from human infections. We hypothesized that S intermedius may cause human dog bite wound infections and that it has been previously misidentified as S aureus. Fourteen isolates from clinically infected dog bite wounds that were originally identified as S aureus were subjected to further testing; three (22%) were found to be S intermedius. The clinical and microbiological characteristics of these three S intermedius cases are described. All three patients were nonimmunocompromised persons seen within 24 hours for bites on the upper extremity. All patients developed cellulitis within one to three days. All S intermedius isolates were distinguished from S aureus by the lack of acetoin production and by the presence of beta-galactosidase activity. S intermedius was susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics; one isolate was resistant to penicillin. Two patients were treated with penicillin, one with amoxicillin-clavulanate, and all were clinically cured. These are the first three reported human infections involving S intermedius. Further study is necessary to define its clinical importance as a potential human pathogen.\r"

These three patients illustrate some of the pitfalls in the diagnosis and surgical management of patients with Hirschsprung's disease. Misinformation concerning the surgical correction of this disease still exists, and these patients emphasize the necessity of continued, updated information in the diagnosis, management, and outcome of patients with Hirschsprung's disease.\r"

  ".W": "It is unusual for Hirschsprung's disease to go undiagnosed until late childhood. Adolescents presenting with Hirschsprung's disease offer unique challenges to the surgeon because of the massively dilated and hypertrophied colon that is invariably present. Five adolescents (four males and one female; ages, 11 1/2 to 16 1/4 years) with newly diagnosed Hirschsprung's disease were managed by slightly different methods between January 1981 and March 1987. Three patients had a \"leveling\" colostomy, followed by a Swenson procedure in two and a Duhamel procedure with a temporary diverting colostomy in one. One patient had a primary Duhamel procedure with a temporary diverting ileostomy. One patient had a primary Swenson procedure without diversion. Long-term results were uniformly excellent. Based on the experience with these patients the following principles of management emerge: 1) Avoid loop \"leveling\" colostomies because of their grotesque size and their tendency to retract or prolapse. 2) Rectal tube decompression can often adequately prepare a patient for a primary pull-through procedure. 3) When a diverting ostomy is required, it should be an ileostomy rather than a colostomy because its subsequent closure will not endanger the marginal artery, which if divided, could compromise the blood supply to the pulled-through colon. 4) The Swenson procedure, although difficult in adolescents, can be done with excellent long-term results. 5) Several applications of the stapling instrument are required in the Duhamel procedure to fully divide the septum between the aganglionic rectum anteriorly and the normal colon posteriorly.\r"

  ".W": "Nonpalpable breast lesions in 20 female patients were prospectively evaluated with a new technique of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) under mammographic guidance. The patient age range was 37-82 years (mean: 60 years), and the mammographic indications for biopsy were microcalcifications (30%), mass (30%), mass with calcifications (25%), and asymmetric density (15%). Seven (35%) patients had significant risk factors for breast cancer. Prototype coaxial 19-gauge/22-gauge and 18-gauge/20-gauge needle systems (Cook, Inc., Bloomington, IN) were used for localization and biopsy. The technique involved needle localization of the target lesion with FNAB performed through the localizing needle after radiologic confirmation of position. A localizing wire then was inserted to allow each patient to proceed directly to the operating room for a standard needle localization open biopsy. Successful localization and aspiration was possible in 18 (90%) patients. Surgical excision was performed in all 20 patients and confirmed by specimen radiography in 17 (85%). A significant concordance of 94 per cent was found between the histologic results of the open biopsy specimens and the cytologic findings of aspirated specimens. These findings suggest that mammographically guided FNAB may offer a safe, reliable, and cost-effective alternative to open biopsy of nonpalpable breast lesions. Further study of this procedure is warranted to confirm its potential in this area.\r"

Forty-eight patients were black, representing 5 per cent of all patients with regional melanoma treated during this period. Thirty-one of the 48 patients were men, and 17 were women. Only 21 of the 48 patients had stage I lesions (M.D. Anderson classification), of whom 63 per cent had level IV or greater invasion. The average depth of invasion was 3.70 mm. Of 21 patients with stage III disease, 15 came to diagnosis with an intact primary lesion in addition to regional disease, and the majority of lesions arose on a plantar site with level V invasion. Eighty per cent of the patients had acral lentiginous melanoma. All melanoma patients were treated by isolated regional perfusion with wide excision of the primary plus regional lymph node dissection for biopsy-proven regional disease. At 10 years, survival rates were 71 per cent for stage I patients and 12.5 per cent for those with stage III disease. When black patients having had acral melanoma on a plantar or palmar site were compared with white patients of a similar stage of disease, however, it was found that black patients had equivalent long-term survival rates.\r"

  ".U": "89206013\r", 
  ".W": "Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is widely used in the evaluation of nodular thyroid disease. From January 1979 to May 1983, 100 patients underwent FNA biopsy at Wake Forest University Medical Center for evaluation of nodular thyroid disease. Forty-six underwent immediate thyroidectomy based upon clinical and cytologic criteria. Fifty-three patients identified as having benign atypical or normal cells initially were managed nonoperatively. An additional patient with Hurthle cell neoplasm diagnosed by cytologic evaluation refused surgery and is included in the group treated nonsurgically. This report concentrates on the characteristics and subsequent course of these 54 patients. Emphasis was placed on whether surgery was actually avoided or merely delayed by the results of FNA biopsy. Follow-up evaluation ranged from 16 to 92 months (mean, 57 months). Fifty-two (96%) patients had not been operated upon for thyroid disease during the follow-up period, and in none of the 52 had there developed new indications for surgery. The two (4%) patients who had undergone thyroidectomy proved to have benign disease. The authors conclude that with adequate clinical follow-up, FNA biopsy can accurately and appropriately guide the nonoperative management of nodular thyroid disease, and that the technique does spare patients the cost and risk of thyroidectomy, both initially and during subsequent follow-up evaluation.\r"

Nineteen (48.7%) of 39 with TAA had major postoperative complications, while 25 (26.3%) of 95 with the abdominal approach (AA) had similar complications (P less than 0.02). The most frequent complication was anastomotic leakage. In the case of TAA, seven (18.0%) experienced this, and nine (9.5%) did so after AA. However, deaths resulting from complications were few for both TAA (five, or 12.8% and AA nine, or 9.5%). There was one (2.6%) patient with histologically positive cancer cells at the proximal stump of the resected specimen in patients with TAA, while there were seven (7.7%) such patients with AA. In the histologically curative cases without palliative factors, patients with TAA had a significantly better prognosis than did those with AA (P less than 0.05). In the histologically noncurative cases and in cases with palliative factors, the prognosis was poor for both TAA and AA patients. These results suggest that the surgeon should perform the TAA in order to obtain tumor-free margins at the proximal stump and a better prognosis in patients without palliative factors, while the surgeon need not consider doing the TAA in patients with palliative factors.\r"

In one group (17 patients) who did have previous surgery, cryosurgery was used for the predominant symptoms of melena and/or obstruction. In the postoperative period, local bleeding was minimal, and palliation was judged significant. The survival time of this group ranged from 1 month to 18 months. In another group (10 patients) in whom recurrent cancer followed previous operative treatment, cryosurgery was used to control the local invasion and tumor bulk. All of these patients died within 17 months after recurrence was discovered. Nevertheless, treatment was judged to provide significant palliation. A small group (five patients) was treated with the intent to cure, and cryosurgical techniques were used as an adjunct to surgical excision. Four patients survived more than 8 years after the operation. Two of these patients died of illnesses other than cancer. The local destruction of an anorectal cancer by cryosurgery in these patients provided effective control of the tumor. Bleeding was controlled, and tumor bulk was reduced in size. All patients were treated without any complications caused by cryosurgery. This experience indicates that the cryosurgical technique provides therapeutic benefits for selected patients with anorectal cancer, especially those of high surgical risk.\r"

In them, once the artificial elevation (Carhart effect) of the bone conduction thresholds, which occurs whenever there is an abnormality of the sound conduction mechanism, had been taken into account, there was no difference in the bone conduction thresholds compared with those in 920 control ears. In addition, in 100 instances, the contralateral ear was normal and there was no difference in the bone conduction thresholds between the diseased and the normal ears. Raised bone conduction thresholds in chronic otitis media are considerably likely to reflect both the Carhart effect and the high prevalence of sensorineural impairments, rather than disease damage to the inner ear.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether low frequency oscillatory ventilation (LFOV) may be safely applied through the suction channel of a pediatric fiberoptic bronchoscope, we devised a system using a combination of jet ventilation and constant air suction, both delivered with a single interface valve. The system was tested on an in vitro lung model and on rabbits. With tidal volumes of 12 mL, inadvertent increase in functional residual capacity (FRC) measured in the lung model was minimal. All rabbits experienced marked hypoventilation (PaCO2 62 +/- 2 torr) on introduction of the bronchoscope, which promptly improved with administration of LFOV (PaCO2 41 +/- 4 torr). That baseline FRC remained stable indicated that air trapping did not occur. We conclude that LFOV improves ventilation in rabbits during bronchoscopy without causing air trapping. A similar system might be applied during bronchoscopy in full-term and premature infants, thus facilitating safer and more complete visualization of their airways and preserving the possibility of obtaining samples by suction.\r"

Both carcinogens yielded identical tumors consisting of small, undifferentiated, neuroblastic cell elements without specialized cell contact. Cell processes contained microtubuli, centrioles, and neurosecretory granules. Two kinds of rosettes were encountered frequently: neuroblastic Homer Wright rosettes consisted of undifferentiated cells, surrounding a minute lumen filled with amorphous material; and Flexner rosettes showed a higher degree of maturation. Inside their central lumen, cell processes with characteristic features of olfactory sensory cells (basal bodies, cilia, centrioles, microtubuli) could be demonstrated. The stem cell of this tumor is most likely the undifferentiated light basal cell inside the olfactory epithelium, since its ultrastructural appearance and its cytoskeleton are alike. At least under neoplastic conditions, this stem cell may likewise differentiate into epithelial cells, since transition to squamous cell carcinomas has been observed. In view of their overwhelming similarity to their human counterpart, the induced tumors are most likely to represent esthesioneuroepitheliomas.\r"

Once the existence of hypothyroidism was established, immediate substitution therapy resulted in rapid healing of the fistulas and marked improvement of the patients' general condition. Few clinical reports exist on postoperative hypothyroidism and wound healing complications. Experimental work shows delay and impairment of wound healing in hypothyroid animals as opposed to hyperthyroid ones, in which wound healing was accelerated. Suspicion is warranted in patients after treatment for head and neck cancer when they exhibit even minimal symptoms of hypothyroidism or develop postoperative complications refractory to conservative treatment.\r"

In this series there were two recurrences following primary surgical procedures and these required a second procedure. There were no major complications and all 18 patients are alive. We believe that surgical excision should be the treatment of choice for JNA and that radiotherapy should be used adjunctively for cases wherein intracranial extension of the tumors prevents total excision.\r"

Serum concentrations before and after gentamicin treatment were at therapeutic levels. All infants were examined at least 1 1/4 months after cessation of therapy.

Since the mucociliary function in the middle ear is similar, and the middle ear may be invaded by atmospheric pollutants, we decided to investigate the possible contribution of sulfur dioxide to middle ear effusion. Guinea pigs were exposed for 24 hours to 300 ppm of sulfur dioxide or air. Immediately after exposure, ciliary activity and epithelial structure were examined close to the tympanic orifice (proximal site) and more distal to it (distal site). In the animals exposed to sulfur dioxide, no effusion was found in the tympanic cavity. Ciliary activity was reduced only in the distal site. Electron microscopy demonstrated hypersecretion in the proximal site and severe pathologic changes in the distal site. Although the normally functioning cilia in the proximal site may prevent retention of surplus secretions in the ear, sulfur dioxide may promote middle ear effusion when combined with other detrimental factors, because it stimulates mucus secretion in the proximal site and impairs ciliary function in the distal site.\r"

Six (18%) of the survivors have required correction of recurrent coarctation, and one is awaiting repair. Newborn babies suspected of having coarctation should be assessed for surgical correction without delay, and medical treatment (including, if necessary, infusion of prostaglandin E2 in a dose of 0.025 micrograms/kg/minute) should be instituted in the interim. Long term follow up is important to detect systemic hypertension or recurrence of the coarctation. This occurred in seven (21%) of our survivors.\r"

There were 38 salt losers and 14 simple virilisers in 968,303 live births, an incidence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia of 1:18,000 in the Hungarian population. Selective screening led to earlier diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia and a pronounced decrease in mortality. A central laboratory to measure the blood spot 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations is valuable for the investigation of patients at risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia in countries where blood steroid assays are not readily available.\r"

The plasma clearance in these infants (3-3 ml/min/kg) was slightly larger than in newborns or in either group of older children (2.9 and 2.4 ml/min/kg respectively). Thus the most dramatic changes in trimethoprim pharmacokinetics seem to occur during the first two months of life. A reduced daily dose of trimethoprim is necessary during the first two months only. An increased daily dose, by addition of a third dose each day, is recommended from two months.\r"

Being tall at presentation seems to be associated with a poor outcome. Self starvation of early onset may result in short stature in some cases. There seem to be more boys among the group in whom the disease was of early onset than would be predicted from the sex ratio among adult patients. In addition boys with anorexia nervosa may have a better prognosis than girls.

Compared with recently published data for normal school children the fat content of the diet was reduced (30.0%) as were intakes of iron and zinc.

We conclude that many children with cystic fibrosis are still on low fat diets and whole milk is the single most useful food for the provision of extra dietary fat and energy.\r"

The centiles for weight, height, and head circumference were recorded at both 2 and 5 years of age for 135 very low birthweight children and 42 normal birthweight children. At both ages significantly more children of very low birth weight were under the 10th centile for weight and height. Children of birth weight under 1000 g were more often under the 10th centile for weight at 5 years compared with those of birth weight 1000-1500 g. Mean incremental weight gain between 2 and 5 years was significantly less for very low birthweight children. Mean increment in weight from 2 to 5 years was less for very low birthweight children who had been under the 10th centile for weight at 2 years; children who had been under the 10th centile for height also had lower mean height increments. The growth centiles achieved by 2 years of age were useful predictors of poor growth at 5 years, with perinatal data of marginal importance. Only six of 43 (14%) children with a weight at 5 years of age under the 10th centile were small for gestational age at birth. Very low birthweight children who had a weight or height under the 10th centile at 2 years of age usually remained in this category at 5 years with no evidence of catch up growth.\r"

The distribution of age at menarche was not influenced by social class. Weight adjusted for height did not play an important part in the timing of sexual maturation of the girls in the study. Relative weight (weight expressed as a percentage of standard weight) at the ages of 7 and 11 years explained only 3.2%, and 4.9%, respectively of the variation in age at menarche, and changes in relative weight between these two ages accounted for 2%. Girls with early menarche were more likely to be overweight at ages 7, 11, and 16 years than those with late menarche, although early menarche was also reported by girls who were underweight or of average weight. These findings support the hypothesis that in well nourished populations the relation between menarche and body size is largely regulated by genetic factors and that nutrition is less important.\r"

Since Haight's first survivor in 1941, argument has continued about the relative merits of immediate repair, delayed primary repair, and staged repair, and the criteria for selection of each approach. The Waterston classification served as the foundation for selection of surgical management from 1966 to 1982. Since 1982, physiologic status has been used as the sole basis for surgical management without regard to weight, gestation, or pulmonary condition. Twenty-six patients so chosen for immediate repair have all survived. Fewer have required gastrostomy, and the average hospital stay has shown significant decrease, a reflection of improved overall care of the neonate. Thirteen infants with severe cardiopulmonary compromise had some form of staged repair in this latter period with a 77% survival rate. Our experience using a refinement of Waterston's principles has led to more and earlier primary repairs with maintenance of excellent survival rates in stable infants. A staged approach is still useful for certain severely compromised infants.\r"

In patients with certain ductal abnormalities, the pseudocyst operation was combined with a definitive operative drainage of the pancreatic duct and/or of the biliary tree where appropriate. A prospective evaluation of routine preoperative ERCP was undertaken over a 36-month period in all patients scheduled for operative treatment of pseudocyst of the pancreas. From an initial group of 44 patients with pseudocysts, three patients who had spontaneous regression of the pseudocyst were excluded. ERCP was successful in 39 of the remaining 41 patients. Among 41 operated patients, 24 were admitted with a diagnosis of pseudocyst that arose after an episode of acute pancreatitis, and 17 had chronic pancreatitis with pseudocyst. Nine patients, initially assumed to have acute pancreatitis, were recognized to have chronic pancreatitis on the basis of ERCP findings. Communication with the main pancreatic duct (MPD) was demonstrated in 18 of 41 pseudocysts, and the rate of communication was similar in patients with acute and chronic pancreatitis. Dilatation of the MPD was seen in 23 of 41 patients and was associated with chronic pancreatitis in 21. Dilatation of the common bile duct was found in 12 patients with chronic pancreatitis. The operative plan was altered by ERCP findings in 24 of 41 patients; 22 of the 24 patients had chronic pancreatitis. There were no complications of ERCP. These data suggest that ERCP should be performed in all patients with pseudocysts to establish correct diagnosis and to allow optimal choice of operation.\r"

The OPS combines the Injury Severity Score (ISS) corrected for age (%LD50), degree of bacterial contamination, and monocyte HLA-DR antigen expression on hospital admission. The OPS was compared to the ISS, %LD50, Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Combined Trauma Score-ISS (TRISS), and Anatomical Index (AI). Sixty-one seriously ill patients were studied. Patient outcome was defined as uneventful recovery (n = 18), major infection (n = 27), and death (13 of 16 deaths resulted from infection). The assessment scores were compared for their use in prediction of these outcomes, as well as their ability to distinguish patients with good outcome from those patients who developed major infection or died, and to differentiate survival from death. Only the OPS was able to significantly segregate all five outcome groups (p less than 0.05). Although the age-adjusted ISS distinguished between survival and death (p less than 0.05), only OPS consistently distinguished between good outcome and sepsis/death (p less than 0.05), and therefore best identified the patients who developed infection. AI, RTS, and TRISS had little predictive value.\r"

A ten-year retrospective study compares two methods of pharyngeal reconstruction, the pectoralis major musculocutaneous flap (MCF) and the jejunal free autograft. One hundred and seventeen patients undergoing laryngopharyngectomy at Emory University affiliated hospitals between 1977 and 1987 were reconstructed with either the pectoralis major musculocutaneous flap (24 patients) or with the jejunal free autograft (93 patients) Primary repair with the pectoralis MCF was attempted on 12 patients (Group I) with initial success in 5 patients (42%), fistula in 7 patients (58%), and salvage surgery necessary in 6 patients (86%). Primary reconstruction with jejunal free autograft (Group II) was performed in 70 patients with 44 initial successes (63%), 9 graft failures (13%), 5 of which were salvaged by a second jejunal free autograft. Seventeen fistulas occurred (24%). Of these, nine (53%) closed with nonoperative therapy and five (29%) required surgery. Secondary reconstruction with the pectoralis major MCF was attempted in 12 patients with initial success in 3 patients (25%), and fistula in 9 patients (75%). Of these 9 fistula patients, 3 (33%) closed with nonoperative therapy and 6 required salvage surgery, which was successful in only 2 patients. Secondary repair with jejunal free autograft was performed in 23 patients with 13 (56%) initial successes and 8 patients resolving with nonoperative therapy (89%) for a total success rate of 21/23 or 91%. The higher initial success rates and more expeditious resolution of problems demonstrates that the jejunum is the superior method of reconstruction for the pharynx.\r"

  ".W": "Ten per cent of patients with acute pancreatitis will develop pancreatic complications. Differentiating pancreatic pseudocyst formation from pancreatic necrosis may be difficult based on clinical grounds. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of computerized tomography in differentiating these processes. A retrospective analysis was performed of 40 patients who developed pancreatic complications following an episode of acute pancreatitis and who subsequently underwent operation for drainage of their pancreatic fluid collections. All 40 patients had abdominal CT scans performed before surgery and the patients were then categorized on the basis of CT findings as having (1) a pseudocyst with a well-defined cyst wall, (2) peripancreatic fluid marked by the absence of a cyst wall, and (3) a combination of a pseudocyst as well as free peripancreatic fluid. Patients with pseudocysts had an average hospital stay of 14 +/- 2 days, a hospital morbidity rate of 16%, and a hospital mortality rate of 0%. In contrast, patients with peripancreatic fluid collections had an average hospital stay of 43 +/- 4 days (p less than 0.01) and hospital morbidity and mortality rates of 74% (p less than 0.01) and 22% (p less than 0.05), respectively. Patients with both pseudocysts and peripancreatic fluid collections behaved in a similar fashion to patients with peripancreatic fluid alone as characterized by a prolonged hospital stay and a high incidence (80%) of postoperative complications. At one year follow-up, 89% of the patients with pseudocysts were asymptomatic, whereas only 13% (p less than 0.01) of patients with peripancreatic fluid were symptom free. These data demonstrate that pseudocyst and peripancreatic fluid collections have markedly different biologic characteristics both in their short-term and long-term behavior. The results suggest that CT scanning can differentiate these processes and may help in directing the appropriate surgical therapy.\r"

We believe pectus excavatum should be repaired in childhood (1) to relieve structural compression of the chest and allow normal growth of the thorax; (2) to prevent pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction in teenagers and adults; and (3) to obviate the cosmetic impact that may cause a child to avoid sports and gymnastics. Preoperative CT scans now help select those children who need repair to prevent progressive deformities. Pulmonary function studies during vigorous exercise can document respiratory dysfunction in teenagers. These features are reversible if repair is completed before the pubertal growth spurt. The ideal age for repair is 4 to 6 years, which permits enough emotional maturity for a positive hospital experience and avoids later psychological effects. Repair at an earlier age has no operative advantages. Our operative technique consists of the removal of three to four overgrown costal cartilages, repositioning of the sternum with a transverse osteotomy, and internal support using the child's lowest normal ribs, avoiding any prosthetic support. To prevent recurrence in teenagers, we add a temporary bar beneath the sternum to prevent depression of the sternum from the weight of the chest-wall muscle mass. Six hundred sixty-four patients have been followed for 1 to 40 years; 95% have excellent long-term results and only 5% have mild to moderate recurrences. Our current techniques of patient selection and surgery will be presented.\r"

  ".W": "Debate continues as to the role that bacteria play in gallstone pathogenesis in Western countries. We therefore, examined gallbladder and common duct stones from 67 consecutive patients undergoing cholecystectomy and/or common bile duct exploration. Bile was cultured and stone cholesterol content was measured. Stones were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for bacteria. Individual calcium salts were classified by windowless energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis. Gallbladder stones in 65 patients were identified as cholesterol in 46 (71%), black pigment in 17 (26%), and brown pigment in 2 patients (3%). Common bile duct stones from ten patients were cholesterol in 4, black pigment in 2, and brown pigment in 4 patients. The five patients with brown pigment stones were significantly (p less than 0.05) older, more likely to be men and to present with bile duct obstruction. Bile cultures were positive in 13% of patients with cholesterol stones, in 14% of those with black pigment stones, and in all of the patients with brown pigment stones (p less than 0.001). By SEM, bacteria were observed only within the calcium bilirubinate-protein matrix of brown pigment stones (p less than 0.001). In comparison to black pigment stones, brown stones were more likely to contain calcium palmitate (p less than 0.005) and cholesterol (p less than 0.001). We conclude that black and brown pigment stones have different pathogenic mechanisms and that bacterial infection is important only in the formation of brown pigment stones.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred consecutive patients with injuries to the extraperitoneal rectum were treated over a ten-year period at an urban trauma center. The mechanisms of injury included firearms in 82 patients, stab wounds in 3 patients, a variety of other penetrating injuries in 10 patients, and in 5 patients the injuries resulted from blunt trauma. Treatment of the rectal injury was determined by the bias of the operating surgeon, the condition of the patient, and the magnitude of the rectal injury. Proximal loop colostomies were performed in 44 patients, diverting colostomies in 51 patients, Hartmann's procedure in 4 patients, and an abdominoperineal resection in 1 patient. Extraperitoneal rectal perforations were closed in 21 patients and the rectum was irrigated free of feces in 46 patients. Transperineal, presacral drainage was used in 93 patients. Infectious complications potentially related to the management of the rectal wound occurred in 11 patients (11%) and included abdominal or pelvic abscesses (4 patients), wound infections (6 patients), rectocutaneous fistulas (3 patients), and missile tract infections (2 patients). Four patients (4%) died as a result of their injuries. Of the therapeutic options available, statistical analysis revealed that only the failure to drain the presacral space increased the likelihood of infectious complications (p = 0.03); however, as it could not be determined with certainty that the use of, or failure to use, any particular therapeutic option had an effect on the risk of death. It is concluded that colostomy and drainage are the foundations of the successful treatment of civilian injuries to the extraperitoneal rectum. The use of adjuncts such as diverting colostomies, repair of the rectal wound, and irrigation of the rectum has little effect on mortality and morbidity.\r"

  ".U": "89206330\r", 
  ".W": "Perforation of the thoracic esophagus may be fatal unless diagnosed promptly and treated with an effective operation. The wide mortality range in different reports reflects the importance of these two factors. This range spans from as low as 11%, if operation is within 24 hours, to greater than 50% after two to three days. The high mortality with delayed treatment is principally due to inability to surgically close the perforation. Eighteen patients (aged from 31 to 78 years) were treated four hours to 14 days after thoracic esophageal perforation (less than 24 hours: 7 patients; 24 to 72 hours: 7 patients; greater than 72 hours: 4 patients). In 14 patients the perforation was sutured, after which the suture line was buttressed with a circumferential wrap of parietal pleura, originally described by Grillo. Underlying esophageal pathology was corrected and wide mediastinal drainage was instituted. All 14 patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital after a median stay of 20 days. Two patients had minor leaks at the suture line that soon closed. Four patients had perforations too extensive to close. Of these, one was resected, the Urschel procedure was used in two, and the Abbott T-tube drainage was used in one. Three of the four patients died. It was quite significant that the pleural wrap was equally effective with both early (6 patients) and delayed perforations (8 patients). These data indicate that the pleural wrap should be used routinely. Extensive perforations that cannot be closed should probably be treated by resection and drainage, followed by esophageal reconstruction at a later time.\r"

  ".W": "Although the clinical results of Brooke ileostomy are good, patients are permanently incontinent of stool and gas. Alternative operations designed to restore enteric continence, such as ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, must not only be as safe and effective as Brooke ileostomy, but should provide an improved quality of life in order to establish long-term acceptability. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has been performed safely and good functional results have been reported. The quality of life after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, however, has not been documented. Two hundred ninety-eight ileal pouch patients and 406 Brooke ileostomy patients who had the operations performed for chronic ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis formed the basis of the study. After adjusting for age, diagnosis, and reoperation rate, logistic regression analysis of performance scores in seven different categories was used to discriminate between operations. Median follow-up was longer in Brooke ileostomy patients than in ileal pouch patients (104 months vs. 47 months, respectively), and Brooke ileostomy patients were slightly older (38 years vs. 32 years). A great majority of patients in each group were satisfied (93% Brooke ileostomy; 95% ileal pouch-anal anastomosis). Thirty-nine per cent of Brooke ileostomy patients, however, desired a change in the type of ileostomy they had. At 47 months, ileal pouch patients had a median of 5 stools per day and 1 at night, 77% did not experience any daytime incontinence, while 22% reported occasional spotting. In each performance category, the performance score discriminated between operations, with the probability of having had an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis operation increasing with improvement in performance scores (p less than 0.05). We concluded that after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, patients experienced significant advantages in performing daily activities compared to patients with Brooke ileostomy and thus may experience a better quality of life. These results help further to establish ileal pouch-anal anastomosis as a safe, attractive, and valid alternative to Brooke ileostomy.\r"

  ".W": "The prolonged ventricular dysfunction following brief periods of coronary artery occlusion that does not produce irreversible damage has been termed the \"stunned\" myocardium. Although ventricular function returns to preischemic values by 1 to 7 days after reperfusion is established, inotropic therapy may be necessary to enhance contractility in the stunned heart. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of pyruvate on ventricular function in normal and stunned myocardium. Eight chloralose/urethane anesthetized dogs were instrumented with ultrasonic crystals to measure systolic wall thickening in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery perfused regions of the left ventricle. Pyruvate (1 ml/min of 150 mM sodium pyruvate, pH 7.4) was infused directly into the LAD prior to and 30 minutes after a 10 minute LAD occlusion. Prior to LAD occlusion, LAD pyruvate infusion increased systolic wall thickening in the LAD-perfused region from 16.2% +/- 4.3% to 23.4% +/- 5.1% (p less than 0.05). Thirty minutes after LAD occlusion, regional wall thickening was depressed (3.3% +/- 2.6%; p less than 0.05), which is indicative of stunned myocardium. Subsequent LAD pyruvate infusion increased wall thickening in the stunned myocardium to 12.7% +/- 2.5%. The improvement of regional ventricular function was maintained only during the pyruvate infusion, as function returned to prepyruvate levels within 20 minutes after cessation of pyruvate infusion. These data indicate that pyruvate exerts a positive inotropic effect in normal and stunned myocardium. If pyruvate, a key intermediate in energy-producing pathways, exerts its inotropic effect through an enhancement of the energy state of the heart, it may have advantages over traditional inotropic agents in the treatment of postischemic contractile dysfunction.\r"

Thirteen patients were resuscitated from a ventricular fibrillation (VF) episode. Fifteen patients presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to medical therapy. The etiology was coronary artery disease in 23 of 28 patients (82%), dilated cardiomyopathy in 2 of 28 patients (7%), sarcoidosis in 2 of 28 patients, and 1 patient in 28 had lupus erythmatosis. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 29%. A total of 27 of 28 patients (96%) patients had inducible ventricular tachycardia using programmed stimulation. The patients considered for AICD implant failed a mean of 3.6 antiarrhythmic drugs. Rate counting and defibrillating leads were inserted through a lateral thoracotomy in 17 patients and a mediansternotomy incision in 11 patients in conjunction with another cardiac procedure in 10 patients. The generators were positioned in a subcutaneous pocket beneath the left costal margin. There were no operative deaths. The mean follow-up was 6.7 months (range 1 to 14) with no VT/VF deaths in patients with defibrillators. The study demonstrated that AICD is an effective device for prevention of sudden cardiac death.\r"

This review describes the outcome of 170 children who had PA banding at the University of Virginia Medical Center between 1955 and 1988. One hundred and one of the patients were banded between 1958 and 1970; fewer bands were placed in later years because early total correction was feasible for certain conditions. When analyzed by preoperative diagnoses, the data reveal that children with a single ventricle undergoing banding had a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate of 12% compared to other preoperative diagnoses, including atrioventricular canal, truncus arteriosus, and ventricular septal defect (VSD) at 30% (p less than 0.05). The late overall mortality for all patients was approximately 10%, an attrition rate of 1% per year. PA banding still has a role in management of patients with congenital heart disease, particularly for infants with a single ventricle. Actuarial survival at 10 years for patients with this condition is 92%. Interestingly, this indication for pulmonary banding is the same one cited in the original report.\r"

A review of medical follow-up as reported in the literature showed progression of disease in 8% to 22% of patients followed up for five to ten years. There was no convincing evidence that mild primary hyperparathyroidism resulted in progressive osteoporosis or renal failure. Furthermore, no significant improvement in hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, or renal function followed successful parathyroid surgery. Unless future studies demonstrate progressive osteoporosis or renal damage in untreated, mild primary hyperparathyroidism, medical follow-up is a reasonable alternative to surgery in the compliant patient over 50 years of age.\r"

The patients were divided into subgroups based on clinical features and roentgenographic findings of chest x-ray films. In 39 patients, the pleural effusions were due to various nonneoplastic disorders and in 95 patients it was caused by malignancy. In six patients, the causes of the pleural effusions remained undetermined. A final diagnosis was made by pleural examination in 68 patients, by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 58 patients, and by either one or both in 100 patients. In 82 patients who had no hemoptysis, a final diagnosis was made by pleural examination in 57 cases and by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 11 cases only. The diagnostic yield of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (47/58) was superior to that of pleural examination (11/58) in 58 patients presenting with hemoptysis. In 74 patients who had pleural effusions as the sole roentgenographic abnormality, the final entity was established by pleural examination in 45 and by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 12. The diagnostic merit of fiberoptic bronchoscopy was significantly higher in 59 patients who had concurrent pulmonary abnormalities on their chest roentgenograms. A final diagnosis was made in 43 cases by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in comparison with 21 cases by pleural examination. For patients with unknown pleural effusions, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was more likely to yield a diagnosis than thoracocentesis with closed pleural biopsy in those who had hemoptysis or pulmonary abnormality on chest x-ray films, whereas the reverse applied when these features were absent.\r"

Abnormal thyroid examination results and white vs black race were independently associated with a TSH concentration 5 mU/L or more above normal. Female sex and age did not significantly affect the odds of an elevated TSH concentration. The yield of hypothyroidism from symptom-based testing in this setting was quite low. Although increasing age and female sex are both strong determinants of the risk of hypothyroidism in the general population, neither factor permitted risk stratification in symptom-based testing.

  ".W": "Cofactors for the clinical expression of infection due to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not well understood. We asked if there was a familial tendency to the development of complications of HIV infection. We examined 35 hemophilic sibships in which at least two brothers with classic hemophilia (factor VIII deficiency) were infected with HIV. Twenty-four (34%) of the 70 patients had serious sequelae of infection, and 46 (66%) were asymptomatic or had only lymph node enlargement. Using Fisher's exact test, we found the concordance among siblings for serious sequelae of HIV infection was greater than would be expected by chance. When analysis was restricted to include only siblings known to be infected for more than two years, this concordance was still present. In the study population, birth order and mean yearly usage of factor VIII concentrate were unrelated to the outcome of HIV infection. The data indicate a familial tendency to serious complications of HIV infection. The factor(s) responsible for this familial tendency are currently under investigation.\r"

To determine the prevalence of this problem, 15 frail nursing home patients who were receiving phenytoin therapy were studied over a mean follow-up period of 10.6 +/- 0.89 months. The mean number of serum phenytoin level measurements during this period was 13.1 +/- 1.5. For a given individual, there was no variation in phenytoin dose or preparation administered. All the patients had a difference of more than 50% between the highest and the lowest serum phenytoin levels, and in five patients (33%), the difference exceeded 150%. The change in serum phenytoin level was temporally related to influenza vaccination in only three patients. The form of phenytoin was not a significant determinant of the variability in this patient population, nor did enteral feeding have any effect. It is recommended that nursing home patients receiving phenytoin therapy have periodic serum phenytoin measurements obtained, even in the absence of seizures or classic signs of phenytoin toxicity.\r"

Of the volunteers, 32% had detectable anti-Cryptosporidium IgG initially, suggesting that infection sometime in life is common. After six weeks, one year, or two years overseas, 5% (1/19), 14% (8/56), and 13.6% (3/22), respectively, became newly IgG positive. This implies that the risk of acquiring Cryptosporidium infection and its associated diarrhea is real for travelers and temporary workers in endemic areas. Persistence of IgG and/or IgM response for 12 months or more occurred in some volunteers, although the significance is unclear.\r"

All were clinically euthyroid throughout. Normalization of the thyrotropin response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone occurred concomitantly, indicating correction of subtle hyperthyroidism. The mean thyroxine dose decreased from 161 micrograms/d (2.06 micrograms/kg) to 120 micrograms/d (1.51 micrograms/kg). The resting heart rate fell in eight of 11 patients (P less than .02). The left ventricular ejection fraction decreased in eight of 11 patients, although the decrease was not statistically significant. Considering the sensitivity of pituitary, cardiac, and bone tissue to even a small excess of thyroxine over time, hyperthyroxinemia associated with an elevated free thyroxine index should be corrected even in patients taking levothyroxine replacement who are clinically euthyroid and whose serum triiodothyronine concentrations are within normal limits.\r"

Computed tomographic abnormalities found included 21 patients with multiple ring-enhancing lesions, 13 with single ring-enhancing lesions, 11 with single hypodense lesions, and three with multiple hypodense lesions. Twenty-five patients had a positive serologic reaction for Toxoplasma. Sixteen patients had brain tissues examined. Of the 16 patients, six had cerebral Toxoplasma (one with concomitant Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and ten had diagnoses other than toxoplasmosis (three of whom had a positive serologic reaction for Toxoplasma). Two patients had M tuberculosis; one patient had Nocardia asteroides with Salmonella enteritidis. Of the remaining seven patients, three had encephalitis of unknown cause, two had inconclusive tissue diagnoses, one had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and one had vasculitis. In the population of intravenous drug users, brain lesions from diseases other than toxoplasmosis may be just as prevalent. Attempts to obtain a diagnosis from brain tissue is highly recommended to permit the design of effective and specific therapy for those diseases amenable to therapy.\r"

Treatment with amphotericin B, administered intravenously for 3 1/2 months and intrathecally for 13 months, resulted in a disease-free interval of one year. Subsequently, coccidioidal peritonitis developed, which responded to treatment with amphotericin B. However, 29 months after the initial diagnosis, the patient died of complications of hepatic encephalopathy resulting from alcoholic cirrhosis. To our knowledge, this patient represents the first reported case of coccidioidal peritonitis in AIDS and involves the most prolonged survival of a patient with coccidioidomycosis and AIDS. The presence of positive skin test reactivity to coccidioidin may have been a predictor of prolonged survival in this patient.\r"

Bronchoscopy was performed for infection surveillance prior to autologous bone marrow transplantation (nine patients), or to assess abnormal chest roentgenogram (11 patients). Metastatic adenocarcinoma was identified on Papanicolaou-stained-membrane filters in seven patients (35%), corroborated by transbronchial biopsy in four patients. No patients with chest roentgenogram suggestive of metastatic cancer or transbronchial biopsy positive for metastatic cancer had a negative lavage. Monoclonal antibody B72.3 uniformly marked malignant cell aggregates and many single cells that were inapparent in routinely stained material. Because bronchoalveolar lavage may detect metastatic adenocarcinoma with sensitivity comparable to transbronchial biopsy but with less morbidity, it is useful in the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with primary breast carcinoma. Staining with monoclonal antibody B72.3 can be readily performed on lavage specimens and may serve as an adjunct in diagnosing malignancy.\r"

The numbers of such cells were greatly increased in patients with plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy whether that condition was associated with primary pulmonary hypertension or with pulmonary hypertension from intracardiac shunts. The numbers of endocrine cells tended to be increased, but to a lesser extent in patients with pulmonary hypertension and medial hypertrophy of the muscular pulmonary arteries in the absence of plexogenic arteriopathy. Increased numbers of endocrine cells comprised both greater numbers of solitary cells and a pronounced clustering, often of a disorganized nature.\r"

  ".U": "89206453\r", 
  ".W": "Nephrosclerosis, the morbid condition of the kidney that accompanies essential hypertension, is characterized by thickening of the walls of cortical arteries. According to the law of Laplace, the tension in the wall of an artery should be proportional to the product of pressure (P) times diameter (D). Thus, if wall thickness (T) is governed by wall tension, then it should be proportional to the same product: T = kPD, where k is a proportionality constant. A comparison of immersion-fixed kidneys in normotensives aged 75 to 90 years with those aged 19 to 34 years showed the magnitude of k to increase with age. The increase was 41% in vessels that were relatively close to the heart (outer diameter, 150 to 300 microns) and 30% at the more remote level (outer diameter, 80 to 140 microns). In perfusion-fixed specimens, k also increased with age, being 77% and 35% greater, respectively, for the comparison between normotensives in the two age groups. Normotensives were defined to be those with mean blood pressure less than 115 mm Hg. A similar result was found by defining normotension to be systolic pressure less than 140 mm Hg. Wall thickness was not proportional to pressure in hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects, but rather to a quadratic function that combined age and blood pressure taken together. The law of Laplace did not fully encompass the data that relate the thickening of renal arterial walls to hypertension or to aging in the absence of hypertension. The thickening with age is structurally a metaplasia that exchanges fibrotic intima in the elderly for muscular media in the young. The result was reproduced in perfusion- as well as immersion-fixed specimens and is therefore not distorted by postmortem collapse. The results favor the conclusion that arterial wall thickening in hypertensive and aging normotensive kidneys is sclerosis and not adaptive hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We present a case of thymic hyperplasia in which numerous lymphoid follicles with germinal centers were partially surrounded by small sheets of spindle and epithelioid cells. Electron microscopy confirmed the epithelial nature of these cells. Immunostaining was performed using antibodies to keratins, S100 protein, and two B-cell markers, LN1 and MB2. The proliferated epithelium stained only for high-molecular-weight keratin, whereas the lymphoid tissue stained positively for both B-cell markers. To determine the origin of the proliferated epithelium, the staining was compared with that of the developing fetal and normal adult thymus. We have shown that during fetal development, the keratin composition of thymic epithelium changes from staining predominantly with low- to high-molecular-weight keratin. The immunostaining characteristics of the epithelium in this case of thymic hyperplasia suggest an origin from adult-type epithelium. Furthermore, the association of S100-positive interdigitating reticulum cells with the proliferated epithelium suggests that it is of medullary origin. Our results indicate that epithelial proliferation can be an important component of thymic hyperplasia.\r"

The first type of crystalloid, the previously described tyrosine-rich crystalloid, was identified in three (1.5%) of 205 cases. The crystalloids by light microscopy assumed a radial configuration, resulting in the characteristic petal-shaped morphology. Transmission electron microscopy revealed them to be electron-dense, lobular projections without internal structure. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated a range of morphology from rounded and intact doughnutlike structures to aggregates of irregular, loosely cohesive plates. The crystalloids were backscatter positive by backscattered electron imaging, and by x-ray microanalysis exhibited prominent calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium peaks that were not present in the adjacent tumor tissue; these three elements may be important in the formation and structure of tyrosine-rich crystalloids. The second type of crystalloid was intraductal and birefringent and was identified in 26 (12.7%) of 205 cases. In 21 of these 26 cases the crystalloids were lost on 10% formaldehyde fixation and paraffin embedding. Histochemical stains and x-ray microanalysis did not reveal a definite chemical composition, but did suggest a predominantly organic nature.\r"

The intimate association of mast cells and eosinophils in various stages of activation and degranulation with nerves was confirmed by electron microscopy.

The tumor nodules arose in nonantral gastric mucosa showing marked intestinal metaplasia. Diffuse endocrine cell hyperplasia was present in both fundus and antrum. Antral G-cell hyperplasia was observed. A widely accepted pathogenesis of this syndrome suggests that the proliferating cell type is the argyrophilic, enterochromaffinlike cell native to the gastric body and fundus. Our findings conflict with this view, in that focal argentaffin staining was also present within tumor cells, as well as immunoreactivity for serotonin and substance P (more characteristic of small-intestinal enterochromaffin or Kulchitsky's cells and small-intestinal carcinoids). Findings in these cases at least suggest an alternative possibility: the tumors may derive from small-intestinal-type metaplastic endocrine cells within the atrophic mucosa, rather than the hypertrophic native endocrine cell population.\r"

Immunohistochemical study demonstrated coexpression of keratin and vimentin, two intermediate filaments thought to be specific for epithelial and nonepithelial cells, respectively. It is proposed that the spindle transformation of the epithelial cells in such cases may be explained on the basis of the development by the tumor cells of nonepithelial characteristics, such as the expression of vimentin intermediate filaments, that may be responsible for the adoption of the morphological growth pattern characteristic of neoplasms following mesenchyme-derived lines of differentiation.\r"

The patient, a 61-year-old man, was uremic due to diabetic nephropathy. He had suffered posttransfusion hepatitis just before his death. Antemortem radiographic examination of the abdomen failed to visualize the calcification in the liver. At autopsy, microscopic examination of the liver revealed bile ductular proliferation and calcification mainly in the ductular epithelial cells. We suggest that calcification could occur preferentially in abnormally proliferated ductules when the serum calcium and serum phosphorus products are elevated.\r"

The case history and the elimination as causal agent of products manipulated in the patient's work led to the conclusion that the storage was due to excessive consumption of apples, and to a lesser degree of Brussels sprouts.

Although canonical analysis indicated that the same psychological functions (memory, speeded psychomotor performance, and language) are involved in both very mild and mild SDAT, objective levels of performance by the very mildly affected individuals overlapped extensively with those of both healthy aged and mildly demented individuals. Consideration of premorbid individual differences in psychological functions will probably be required if psychometric test performances are to be effective in detecting SDAT in the very mild stage.\r"

Based on caregivers' reports, 39% of subjects engaged in at least three of four behavioral measures of spatial disorientation three or more times a week; these patients did not significantly differ from other Alzheimer's disease subjects with regard to age, sex, education, or symptom duration. Using stepwise regression analysis, we found that neuropsychologic measures of memory and visuoconstructive functions, but not disease severity, attention, or language impairment, emerged as significant predictors of spatial disorientation. In the setting of impaired memory, the tendency of some patients with Alzheimer's disease to wander or to get lost may implicate particularly severe dysfunction of right hemisphere neocortical areas concerned with visuospatial processes.\r"

The areas affected in DAT included the nucleus basalis, and entorhinal, posterior cingulate, visual, and prefrontal cortices. A significant interaction between ganglioside type and brain area indicated unequal ganglioside concentrations. Individual gangliosides had significantly different concentrations in the hippocampal, entorhinal, posterior cingulate, visual, and prefrontal cortices. Analysis of ratios of \"a\"-ganglioside (GM1 and GD1a) and \"b\"-ganglioside (GD1b and GT1b) subtypes indicated that DAT preferentially affected \"b\"-gangliosides. Ganglioside concentrations in nucleus basalis did not correlate with age at disease onset, age at death, or postmortem interval. Changes in gangliosides, observed in this study, were not correlated with classic DAT neuropathology.\r"

We tested this hypothesis by examining interactions among sex, handedness, and location of lateralized, supratentorial AVMs. Data from 112 cases were analyzed by log-linear procedures. We found that (1) females had a greater proportion of left-hemisphere AVMs, whereas males showed an opposite trend; (2) there were no interactions between sex and handedness; and (3) nondextrals showed a higher proportion of AVMs located in frontal regions, regardless of the hemispheric side of the lesion. Although these findings appear to be inconsistent with the Geschwind-Galaburda hypothesis, the inconsistency may be attributable to the embryonic stage at which this developmental abnormality occurs. In addition, the unexpected findings may also reflect our use of multivariate statistical procedures, which control for interaction effects.\r"

Diagnosis of neurocysticercosis was difficult on clinical grounds, but proper integration of data from computed tomography and cerebrospinal fluid analysis provided an accurate diagnosis in every case.

The predictive values of extracranial carotid bruit for ipsilateral intracranial carotid atherosclerosis were 16% for localized bruits and 18% for diffuse bruits. Assessing both carotid arteries together, the predictive value of carotid bruit for moderate-to-severe atherosclerosis at any extracranial carotid site was 85%, there being no difference whether the bruits were diffuse, localized, bilateral, or unilateral. Diffuse or localized bruits, whether unilateral or bilateral, are equally predictive of moderate-to-severe atherosclerosis in the extracranial carotid artery, but both are poor predictors of intracranial carotid artery disease.\r"

Five patients had lesions involving the rostrum and the anterior two thirds to four fifths of the body of the callosum, with the splenium spared. They demonstrated little evidence of disconnection in the modalities indicated, except for left ear suppression on a dichotic listening task and partial somatosensory disruption in some cases.

The FOs and SOs were measured in 11 patients from four families with Best's macular dystrophy who were found to have marked loss of the SOs with prolonged light peaks but relatively preserved normal or near-normal FOs. A patient with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP) with a pericentral distribution of pigmentary changes also had preserved FOs of abnormal phase and markedly subnormal SO with normal light-peak time. Six patients with early RP (two sisters with autosomal recessive RP and four patients from three families with autosomal dominant RP) had greater attenuation of FOs than SOs. These results can be partially explained by consideration of the generators of these potentials and the known pathophysiology of the two diseases.\r"

At various times following a central epithelial abrasion, the tissue was harvested, and Fn was localized on frozen corneal sections by an indirect immunofluorescence technique. There was no detectable Fn in intact, nonwounded control or intact A-corneas, except for Descemet's membrane. Within a half hour after abrasion, a band of Fn appeared on the denuded corneal surface of pair-fed control rats and became a continuous, prominent layer at four hours. This layer remained until 16 hours but disappeared at 24 hours when the epithelium had resurfaced over the defect. In severely A- rats, reepithelialization following central epithelial abrasion was delayed, and no Fn band was discernible at any time from one to 32 hours after injury. Light microscopy revealed a progressive increase in polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration with time in the underlying stroma in severely A- rats. This study indicated that in severe vitamin A deficiency, delayed epithelial migration is associated with an inflammatory cell layer and occurred in the absence of Fn.\r"

A decorating pattern similar to that seen in normal eyes was observed, as well as apparent areas of underperfusion, suggestive of possible segmental changes in aqueous outflow. These findings may support the hypothesis that primary open angle glaucoma is a segmental disease of the outflow system due to possible regional increases in resistance to aqueous outflow.\r"

Four days, two weeks, and two months after surgery, the control eyes still had not developed chorioretinal wound healing. In contrast, the edges of the retinal tear treated with TGF-beta were adherent to the underlying Bruch's membrane via localized fibrous tissue without apparent effects elsewhere. These results demonstrate intraocular in vivo bioactivity of TGF-beta and suggest that TGF-beta may have a potential role as an alternative means for inducing a chorioretinal adhesion in the treatment of retinal tears.\r"

We observed three phases of the neovascular process in the iris. The early phase was characterized by vessel dilation and intense uptake of tritiated thymidine in the vascular endothelial cells. In the intermediate phase, prominent new vessels, ectropion uveae, peripheral anterior synechiae, and elevated intraocular pressure developed. Also noted were a decrease in tritiated thymidine uptake of the endothelial cells, a remarkable increase in stromal cell tritiated thymidine activity, and the formation of a neovascular membrane in association with the anterior migration of stromal cells. The late phase was marked by a further reduction of tritiated thymidine uptake and regression of the neovascular membrane.\r"

The threshold energy for ablation was proportional to the square root of the pulse duration and varied from 2.5 microjoules (microJ) at 100 fs to 500 microJ at 8 ns. Excisions made with picosecond and femtosecond lasers was ultrastructurally superior to those made with nanosecond lasers and, at pulse energies near threshold, showed almost as little tissue damage as excisions made with excimer lasers at 193 nm. We conclude that ultrashort-pulsed lasers at visible and near-infrared wavelengths are a possible alternative to excimer lasers for corneal surgery and might have advantages over conventional ophthalmic neodymium-YAG lasers for some intraocular applications.\r"

Despite the excellent results with a standard tarsal strip procedure for those eyelids with laxity and excess skin, we have encountered a number of patients with lower eyelid or canthal malpositions or both who would benefit from a tarsal strip, but who do not have lax tissues (especially skin), and may in fact have a shortage of skin. These include cases of lower lid retraction or canthal malposition following trauma, blepharoplasty, or other operations, and patients with tendency toward or having cicatricial ectropion. Any anterior lamella removal in such patients would aggravate the lid malposition and weaken the lateral canthal tissues to be sutured. We suggest a modification of the tarsal strip (developed by one of us [R.L.A.]) to treat many such patients without requiring additional anterior lamella (skin graft) or more formidable procedures. We refer to this technique as the \"enhanced tarsal strip\" technique, and we use this technique more frequently than the original tarsal strip procedure.\r"

The expression of CR1 was quantitated using flow cytometry. Genotypes were determined by analyzing the CR1 gene restriction fragment length polymorphism using the CR1.1 complementary DNA probe and the Hind III restriction enzyme. In normal subjects, the distribution of the HH, HL, and LL genotypes fit the Hardy-Weinberg law. The frequency for the H allele did not differ between the 2 groups. No individual homozygous for the LL genotypes was found among the SLE patient population. Taken together, data from this and previous studies indicate an under-representation of the LL homozygous genotype in patients with SLE. SLE patients expressed decreased numbers of CR1 per erythrocyte within each genotype compared with these numbers in normal subjects. The results suggest that defective expression of CR1 in SLE patients is acquired and that the presence of the L allele is not linked to a genetic susceptibility for SLE.\r"

In a parallel study, anti-Ro occurred in 28% of the first-degree relatives of unselected members of families of SLE patients, regardless of the proband's serologic status, compared with 6% of the relatives from normal healthy families. Antibodies to La and to Sm/nuclear RNP were infrequent. Anti-Ro occurred in 41% of the relatives considered to have a dominant, non-HLA-linked \"autoimmune trait\" by virtue of having any autoimmune disorder and/or serologic abnormality (antinuclear antibodies, anti-single-stranded DNA, or biologic false-positive VDRL test result), as compared with only 2% of the healthy, seronegative relatives without the trait (P = 0.009). Moreover, HLA-DR2 and/or DR3 occurred in 90% of anti-Ro-positive subjects, regardless of their clinical status. These results demonstrate that the Ro autoantibody response occurs frequently in relatives of patients with SLE and is genetically mediated by both major histocompatibility complex and non-major histocompatibility complex effects.\r"

Exercising muscle blood flow was estimated by 133xenon clearance in a subgroup of 16 fibrositis patients and compared with that in 16 matched sedentary controls; the fibrositis patients exhibited reduced 133xenon clearance. These results indicate a need to include aerobic fitness as a matched variable in future controlled studies of fibrositis and suggest that the \"detraining phenomenon\" may be of relevance to the etiopathogenesis of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Both purified hyaluronic acid (HA) and bovine synovial fluid react with OCI-, the major oxidant produced by the myeloperoxidase (MPO)/H2O2/CI- system, resulting in a decrease in their specific viscosity. This reaction is inhibited in the presence of excess methionine. H2O2 alone decreases the viscosity of HA, presumably by the Fenton reaction, in the absence (but not in the presence) of the iron chelator, diethyltriaminepentacetic acid (DETAPAC). In the presence of DETAPAC, incubation of HA with the complete MPO/H2O2/CI- system lowered the viscosity of HA. Analysis of 3H-HA exposed to OCI- by gel filtration chromatography indicated that cleavage of HA occurred only at higher OCI- concentrations. We suggest that the reduction in viscosity of HA by the MPO/H2O2/CI- system may be due to a combination of oxidative cleavage and changes in the conformation of the molecule. We speculate that the changes in the molecular size of rheumatoid synovial fluid HA may be due to the action of the neutrophil MPO/H2O2/CI- system.\r"

  ".W": "We recently found that injection of 2 mCi of yttrium 90 (90Y; approximately 23,000 rads) into normal canine knees stimulated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis by femoral condylar cartilage. The present investigation was conducted to determine whether radiation affects cartilage metabolism directly. Rates of GAG synthesis and degradation in normal canine articular cartilage were studied following irradiation. Cultured synovium from the same knees was treated similarly, to determine the effects of irradiation on hyaluronic acid synthesis. Twenty-four hours after exposure to 1,000 rads, 10,000 rads, or 50,000 rads, 35S-GAG synthesis by the cartilage was 93%, 69%, and 37%, respectively, of that in control, nonirradiated cartilage. The effect was not rapidly reversible: 120 hours after exposure to 50,000 rads, GAG synthesis remained at only 28% of the control level. Autoradiography showed marked suppression of 35S uptake by chondrocytes after irradiation. Cartilage GAG degradation was also increased following irradiation: 4 hours and 8 hours after exposure to 50,000 rads, the cartilage GAG concentration was only 66% and 54%, respectively, of that at time 0, while corresponding values for control, nonirradiated cartilage were 90% and 87%. In contrast to its effects on cartilage GAG metabolism, radiation at these levels had no effect on synovial hyaluronic acid synthesis.\r"
