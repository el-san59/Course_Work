  ".W": "It has been postulated that for prosopagnosia to occur, bilateral lesions of the central visual system are usually necessary. All but 1 of the 10 previously documented cases that came to autopsy showed this pattern. However, the long survival period after the onset of prosopagnosia in most of these patients limits the value of the autopsy findings for clinicopathological correlation. A patient is presented who died 10 days after she had developed prosopagnosia, topographagnosia and an agnosia for real objects seen from noncanonical views. These clinical symptoms corresponded directly to the autopsy finding of a recent large occipitotemporal ischaemic infarct in the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery. An additional right frontal infarct and a cortical microinfarct in a deep left lateral parieto-occipital sulcus were both old lesions and had passed unnoticed clinically. This first report of a direct clinicopathological correlation between a fresh right posterior lesion and prosopagnosia demonstrates that bilateral involvement of the visual system is not a prerequisite for prosopagnosia.\r"

  ".W": "Vertical smooth eye movements were quantified by magnetic search coil oculography in 7 patients with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), 4 bilateral and 3 unilateral, and compared with age-matched normal subjects. The upward and downward vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) had reduced gain and abnormal phase lag in both unilateral and bilateral INO during active head motion at frequencies from 0.25 to 2 Hz. The phase lag was attributed to disruption of vestibular eye velocity signals and relative preservation of eye position signals. Fixation of a stationary target enhanced smooth eye movement gain during vertical head motion but it remained subnormal. Vertical smooth pursuit gain was mildly reduced. All patients had normal gaze (eye plus head) gain when tracking with both the head and eyes despite defective cancellation of the vertical VOR; they employed high amplitude head tracking to compensate for the uncancelled VOR. Cancellation was more impaired than smooth pursuit. Dissociation between cancellation and ocular pursuit was also demonstrated by a model of VOR cancellation that uses measured pursuit gain with the head immobile to predict gaze gain of eye-head tracking. The model predicted eye-head tracking gain in normal subjects but not in patients with INO. The results indicate that the medial longitudinal fasciculi or neighbouring tegmental tracts convey bidirectional signals for vertical pursuit, cancellation, and vestibular smooth eye movements in man, and that smooth pursuit and cancellation of the VOR can be dissociated in INO.\r"

  ".W": "In order to identify the effects of x-irradiation on spinal cord histology and capillary permeability, we irradiated the upper thoracic spinal cord of adult rats with 3500 cGy to a single lateral field. After 165 +/- 14 (SD) days the rats became paraplegic over 4 to 8 days. Quantitative autoradiography using 14C-amino-isobutyric acid demonstrated a biphasic curve of regional capillary permeability changes (K1). K1 first increased 70 to 85% in all regions of the cord at 30 days, then normalized at 60 days. From 60-151 +/- 8 days in asymptomatic animals there was an apparently exponential increase of K1 in all spinal cord regions progressing at varying rates among regions, most rapidly in the posterior columns and least rapidly in grey matter. K1 continued to rise when the animals became paraplegic. Morphologically, the asymptomatic period was characterized by myelin pallor and vacuolation evident at 30 days, maximal at 60 days, without progression until 151 +/- 8 days when microscopic foci of necrosis appeared in the posterior columns of some clinically normal ('preparetic') animals. The paretic period was characterized by extensive posterior and lateral column necrosis with preservation of grey matter. High dose dexamethasone or indomethacin had no preventative effect when administered just prior to irradiation. Dexamethasone transiently improved motor strength in symptomatic rats and reduced K1 in nonnecrotic portions of the cord. This study suggests that, after a transient peak of 'early delayed' changes in regional capillary permeability, there is progressive damage to the endothelium that may play a primary role in delayed radionecrosis.\r"

Experimental findings cannot be accounted for both by the view that only episodic memory is impaired in amnesia, while semantic memory is spared, and by the theory that what is spared in amnesia is procedural learning contrasted with impaired declarative memory. In agreement with Warrington and Weiskrantz (1982), diencephalic amnesia is considered to be a disconnection syndrome between the frontal and temporal lobes. The conditions for showing spared and impaired memory in amnesics are specified on the basis of the performance of the patient and of the data available in the literature. This allows us to derive practical suggestions for programmes aimed at remediation of memory defects.\r"

  ".W": "Extracellular microelectrode recordings were obtained from lateral temporal cortex that was subsequently resected in patients undergoing craniotomies under local anaesthesia for treatment of medically intractable epilepsy. During these recordings patients performed visually presented measures of overt and silent naming and word reading, short-term verbal memory and a control task requiring matching of angles. These measures were designed so that the same visual stimuli elicited language, short-term memory or spatial responses. Statistically significant changes within and between these various measures were identified. Technically satisfactory recordings were obtained from 17 populations reflecting activity predominantly from 1 neuron, in 13 patients. Two populations demonstrated no significant changes in any measured functions. Only 1 population showed changes suggesting a relation to visual perception. Four populations in or adjacent to the superior temporal gyrus altered activity with overt speech. Four other populations in the anterior temporal lobe altered activity during silent, but not overt speech. Some relation to language or memory was established for 13 of the 17 populations: 1 altered activity during reading alone, 6 during memory alone, and 6 to both. Most of the recording sites showing these language and memory changes were not essential for those functions based on surface electrical stimulation mapping. Thus the area of temporal lobe that participates in language and memory, as indicated by changes in neuronal activity, is substantially larger than the areas essential for those functions as determined by stimulation mapping. Within that participatory area, changes related to language were most often an increase in activity sustained throughout the task, a pattern suggestive of mechanisms of selective attention. Changes related to memory most often included a sustained increase in activity at the time of entry of information into memory, and again at retrieval, with decreased activity during the time the memory was stored. A few neuronal populations demonstrated relative inhibition of activity during the memory task, compared with control measures.\r"

  ".U": "89089032\r", 
  ".W": "The retinal coordinates of an image are normally insufficient to define the direction of an object in body-centred visual space. Gaze direction, specified by information on the position of eye-in-head and on the position of head-on-torso, is also required. While the source of the eye-in-head signal is controversial, it is clear that proprioceptive signals from neck muscles are sufficient to provide head-on-torso information. Observations by Goodwin et al., beginning in 1972, that vibration of limb muscles modifies proprioception from them, and induces illusory motion and false perception of limb position, suggested this study of the effects of neck muscle vibration on the representation of visual space. Verbal reports, supported by objective measures, revealed that vibration of muscles on one side of the neck induces a visual illusion: contralateral displacement of a small visual target viewed in the dark. Pointing movements towards the target are similarly affected, confirming that the representation of directions in visual space is modified by neck muscle vibration. A second vibration-induced illusion was uncovered when apparent displacement ceased. This is an illusion of pure target motion in the same direction as the previously observed displacement. The magnitudes of both the displacement and pure motion illusions were dependent on vibration amplitude and were unrelated to real or apparent movements of eyes or head. Taken together these observations indicate that vibration of neck muscles can modify independently (1) the central representation of the instantaneous direction of gaze and (2) the signal of the velocity with which this direction is changing.\r"

The brain tissue analysed represented white matter with incomplete infarction, complete infarcts and with histologically normal tissue, in cases with dementia, mainly of Alzheimer and multi-infarct type, in nondemented subjects with cerebral infarcts and in age-matched control cases. The biochemical results verify the existence of the white matter changes and agree on their regional distribution as they appear in the morphological analyses. The increasing severity of SIWI as assessed histologically was reflected in a proportional reduction of several biochemically quantified white matter components. The histological difference between incomplete and complete infarction was also expressed biochemically. Incomplete white matter infarction with and without associated complete infarcts were biochemically similar. The aetiological significance of the loss of different white matter components is discussed. The biochemical data support the concept of SIWI as being an independent white matter disorder of cerebrovascular, hypoperfusional/hypoxic origin.\r"

MAO was assessed by specific[3H] pargyline binding, which is stoichiometric and irreversible, and by measuring the rate of oxidation of several MAO substrates. Basal ganglia structures (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus and substantia nigra) and hippocampus had about twice the levels of MAO that were present in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Cerebral microvessels, which constitute the blood-brain barrier, had minimal MAO, while the choroid plexus, which constitutes the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and the liver had higher MAO levels than any brain region. The vast majority of MAO (80-95%) in these tissues was of the B type, except in microvessels, where total MAO activity was low. Specific [3H]pargyline binding correlated well with the oxidation rates for 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and benzylamine in all tissues. Both specific [3H]pargyline binding and the rate of oxidation of MAO substrates increased with age.\r"

Intensity discrimination defects were found in 53.5% and IATD defects in 82% of definite MS cases, although no overt auditory symptoms were reported and pure tone audiology was unremarkable. Corresponding figures in the isolated lesion group were 25% and 33%. Defects were manifested either by an abnormal 'bias' in favour of one ear or by a broadened 'spread' of responses (i.e., greater range of uncertainty). Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were abnormal in 75% of the definite MS cases but only in 8% of the isolated lesion group. BAEP abnormalities involving component III on one or both sides were invariably associated with a defect of IATD discrimination. This is consistent with disruption of input to the superior olivary complex, the most peripheral structure where binaurally responsive units are sensitive to IATD. Lesions causing abnormality of component V alone less frequently resulted in impaired IATD discrimination, possibly because at rostral levels the IATD is encoded by the location rather than the timing of neuronal activity. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), abnormalities of the medulla, pons or midbrain were demonstrated in all MS patients tested and 45% of those with isolated brainstem lesions. The correlation with BAEP abnormalities was plausible in some patients but apparently anomalous in others. More severe BAEP abnormalities than would have been expected on the basis of MRI may have been due to small unresolved lesions, while the more frequent finding of normal or mildly abnormal BAEPs in conjunction with extensive MRI abnormalities may have been due to the fact that areas of abnormal signal reflect an increase in the water content of the tissue rather than demyelination per se.\r"

In spontaneous speech, many HD patients exhibited a loss of conversational initiative. Dysarthria was a common finding. Reading skills were found to be impaired mainly as a consequence of dysarthria; some HD patients displayed visual dyslexia. In addition to the characteristic disturbances of writing skills due to the choreiform movement disorder, the writing of HD patients with advanced dementia indicated constructional dysgraphia, characterized by frequent omissions, perseverations and substitutions. HD patients exhibited no evidence of word-finding difficulty or other semantic deficits in spontaneous speech. There was, however, a marked impairment in visual confrontation naming, with a significant rise in naming error rate as the disease progressed in severity. In most instances, the inappropriate names referred to an object visually similar to the target object, suggesting that visual misperception is the major cause of the naming disorder in HD. Syntactical structure of spontaneous speech was typically reduced to short, simple sentence construction. Verbal stereotypes were only rarely encountered and occurred late in the course of the disease. Tests of language comprehension reflected the general degree of dementia. It is concluded that there are no primary language changes in HD. Instead, a variety of language impairments develop secondary to other neurological and neuropsychological changes.\r"

The clinical disease of 23 days duration was a combination of the paralytic and 'furious' forms of rabies. Serial BAEP and EEG recordings, CT and MR scans of the brain, as well as CSF findings, demonstrated severe ascending destruction of the brain. An unusual progression from isolated brainstem death to cortical brain death occurred. Neuropathologically, the brain showed severe lytic changes. The presence of rabies-related virus antigens in brain smears was shown using a panel of fluorescent antibodies. The virus was inoculated into and isolated from suckling mice. The virus had a close resemblance to European bat rabies isolates, which belong to the group of rabies-related viruses. Of particular concern is whether the virus can spread from bats to terrestrial animals and whether the European type of bat rabies constitutes a danger to man.\r"

In an Oddball paradigm, there was no evidence of any left-right hemisphere asymmetry in the scalp distribution of the P300 that varied as a function of the side of surgery in either the left or right temporal lobectomy patients. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences in overall P300 amplitude or latency between the patients and controls.

However, when 4 of the rehabilitated patients were tested with their eyes closed, their performance reverted to that shown before rehabilitation, that is, a substantial left-side disadvantage.

Two patients also developed oliguric renal failure. Renal biopsy in one showed minimal change nephropathy and in three cases membranous nephropathy. Interstitial nephritis was present on renal biopsy in all cases. The nephrotic syndrome and renal failure resolved in all cases after withdrawal of sulindac. Two patients received steroid therapy and improvement in renal function and disappearance of proteinuria seemed to be temporarily related to steroid therapy in both cases. Despite the fact that sulindac is less likely to cause renal failure due to inhibition of renal prostaglandin secretion this report shows that sulindac treatment can be associated with renal failure and the nephrotic syndrome.\r"

Dietary composition was comparable and sodium intake was restricted to 100-120 mmol/day. 2. Analyses were performed on 30 min urine collections obtained after overnight water deprivation and during water diuresis. Male IH patients had increased levels of urinary PGE at all ranges of urine flow. PGE excretion correlated directly with urine flow in patients and controls, but the slope of this relationship in individual IH male patients was steeper than in controls (P less than 0.01). Calciuria correlated directly with urine output in patients with IH but not in controls. Calcium and sodium excretion were directly correlated (P less than 0.0001) in patients and controls. There were no significant differences between absorptive IH (seven patients) and renal IH (eight patients). There were no significant differences between stone formers with normocalciuria and control subjects. 3. The findings suggest that increased urinary PGE could play a role in the hypercalciuria syndrome, possibly by promoting natriuresis.\r"

It is known that the perfusion of rat livers with solutions containing protoporphyrin IX induces a decrease in bile flow which is not due to inhibition of bile acid secretion but rather to decreased electrolyte transport into bile. By contrast, ursodeoxycholate induces hypercholeresis, partly due to a marked stimulation of biliary bicarbonate secretion. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of protoporphyrin IX on ursodeoxycholate-induced choleresis in anesthetized male Wistar rats. 2. Protoporphyrin IX infusion at rates of 10, 20 and 40 micrograms min-1 100 g-1 body weight into the jugular vein induced a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on bile flow as well as on bile acid and electrolyte secretion. The lowest infused rate only induced slight and non-significant changes in spontaneous bile formation and functional variables such as glycaemia, packed cell volume, blood pH, PCO2, PO2 and bicarbonate concentration, and in hepatic carbonic anhydrase activity. It was thus considered as a subtoxic dose. 3. Sodium taurocholate was infused (0.5 mumol min-1 100 g-1 body weight) over the second hour of the lowest dose of protoporphyrin IX infusion. In these rats, no significant changes in bile flow or bile acid and electrolyte secretion were observed as compared with animals receiving sodium taurocholate plus saline solution. 4. Bile acid secretion induced by ursodeoxycholate infusion (1 mumol min-1 100 g-1 body weight) was similar both in rats receiving ursodeoxycholate plus saline solution and in animals infused with this bile acid over the second hour of the lowest dose of protoporphyrin IX infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the acute study, after a 4 week placebo period two doses of 20 mg of nifedipine decreased supine blood pressure from 155/101 (20.6/13.5) +/- 11/4 (1.5/0.5) to 139/88 (18.5/11.7) +/- 16/9 (2.1/1.2) mmHg (kPa) (means +/- SD; P less than 0.01). Lithium clearance, glomerular filtration rate and sodium clearance did not change. Therefore the calculated values of absolute proximal and absolute distal sodium reabsorption rates were also unchanged, as were potassium clearance, urine flow and body weight. 3. In the long-term study, lithium clearance, glomerular filtration rate, sodium clearance, potassium clearance, urine flow and body fluid volumes were measured after a 4 weeks placebo period and after 6 and 12 weeks of nifedipine treatment. As compared with placebo, mean supine blood pressure decreased significantly. The glomerular filtration rate did not change but lithium clearance fell by 30%. Consequently, the absolute and the fractional proximal sodium reabsorption increased significantly. The fractional distal sodium reabsorption did not change. Sodium clearance, fractional sodium excretion, potassium clearance, plasma volume and extracellular fluid volume were also unchanged. 4. In conclusion, we found no changes of renal tubular sodium reabsorption during acute nifedipine treatment, whereas long-term nifedipine treatment caused a redistribution of tubular sodium reabsorption without a change in overall sodium excretion or body fluid compartments.\r"

To determine the reproducibility of a mental arithmetic stress test and a handgrip exercise test, we studied the responses of blood pressure, heart rate, forearm blood flow and plasma catecholamines on two occasions, with an interval of at least 1 week, in 24 normotensive and 22 hypertensive subjects. 2. The SE of a single observation of the percentage changes of blood pressure ranged from 3.9 to 9.3% in normotensive subjects and from 3.9 to 7.4% in hypertensive subjects in both tests. For heart rate, these values were 4.9-12.3% in the normotensive subjects and 4.8-5.7% in the hypertensive subjects. However, there was a wide individual scatter of these haemodynamic responses during both tests. The forearm blood flow, only measured during mental arithmetic, had an SE of a single observation of 33.7%. 3. In 10 normotensive subjects the SE of a single observation of the change in plasma noradrenaline was 0.16 nmol/l during handgrip exercise and 0.09 nmol/l during mental arithmetic. The corresponding values for plasma adrenaline were 0.04 and 0.05 nmol/l. 4. In conclusion, although both tests showed a rather low SE of a single observation for the blood pressure and heart rate responses in normo- and hyper-tensive subjects, there was a considerable individual variability. If related to the mean forearm blood flow responses, the SE of a single observation of the forearm blood flow response was of similar magnitude. The limited intra-individual reproducibility of both tests should be borne in mind when interpreting pharmacological intervention studies or studies evaluating sympathoadrenal reactivity in cardiovascular disorders.\r"

In order to investigate the effects of K+ depletion on renal function, micropuncture studies were performed on anaesthetized rats which had been kept on a K+-deficient diet for 2 weeks; results were compared with those from control animals. 2. In the K+-depleted animals, values for total glomerular filtration rate and single-nephron filtration rate were significantly lower than in controls. Urine osmolality was also reduced; this was associated with reductions in the osmolality, Na+ concentration and K+ concentration of papillary interstitial fluid. No significant difference between urine and papillary osmolality was observed. 3. Fractional reabsorption by the proximal convoluted tubule was enhanced in the K+-depleted animals; end-proximal fluid delivery was markedly reduced. 4. Absolute, but not fractional, delivery of K+ to the beginning of the distal tubule was reduced in the K+-depleted animals. In contrast to observations in control rats, no net secretion of K+ into the distal tubule occurred and there was indirect evidence of K+ reabsorption in the collecting duct. 5. K+ depletion was associated with reductions in the delivery of Na+ and water to early and late regions of the distal tubule, whereas excretion rates of Na+ and water were unaffected. 6. It is suggested that the reduction in Na+ delivery to the loop of Henle (arising from the changes in filtration rate and proximal tubular reabsorption) might contribute to the reduced medullary osmotic concentration observed during K+ depletion. Reductions in fractional reabsorption of Na+ and water in the collecting duct might result from lowered plasma aldosterone levels and the reduced medullary osmolality.\r"

The present study examined the effect of an infusion of the dipeptide alanylglutamine or of the corresponding amino acids alanine and glutamine in equimolar amounts (10 mumol min-1 kg-1) on the canine hindlimb exchange of alanine and glutamine in the post-operative anaesthetized dog. In contrast to glutamine, the dipeptide alanylglutamine is stable in aqueous solution and therefore would be a suitable substrate for parenteral nutrition. 2. The infusion of alanylglutamine increased (a) the arterial concentration of alanylglutamine to a plateau level (120 +/- 9.5 mumol/l, mean +/- SEM) 20 min after start of the infusion, (b) the mean arterial alanine concentration from 761 +/- 42 to a plateau of 1500-1700 mumol/l (P greater than 0.01) and (c) the arterial glutamine concentration from 407 +/- 51 to a plateau of 1050-1500 mumol/l (P greater than 0.01). Alanine and glutamine levels were slightly higher (14% and 26%, respectively, NS) in the group receiving the equimolar amount of alanine and glutamine. 3. Infusion of alanylglutamine for 1 h abolished the net efflux of glutamine (from -0.80 +/- 0.1 to -0.03 +/- 0.2 mumol min-1 kg-1; P greater than 0.05) and invoked a net influx of alanine (from -0.50 +/- 0.19 to +0.27 +/- 0.14 mumol min-1 kg-1; P greater than 0.01). These changes were similar to those achieved when the two amino acids were infused. 4. This study demonstrates that during short-term administration of alanylglutamine or of the corresponding amino acids the nitrogen release from the hindlimb of the anaesthetized post-operative dog via alanine and glutamine is reduced.\r"

The mean fractional excretion of pepsinogen A was 27.6% (range 4.4-73.9%) in healthy subjects and remained unchanged after omeprazole administration. In patients with renal failure the mean fractional excretion of pepsinogen A was 37.9% (range 7.0-81.9%). The mean fractional excretion of pepsinogen C was 1.0% (range 0.04-6.8%) in healthy subjects and decreased after omeprazole. In patients with chronic renal diseases a sharp rise in fractional excretion of pepsinogen C was observed once glomerular filtration rate was less than 40 ml/min. 3. Fractional excretion of pepsinogen A was unexpectedly high for a negatively charged protein with a molecule mass of 40,000 daltons. This might be explained by the presence of the positively charged activation peptide. Furthermore, pepsinogen C seemed to be almost entirely reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate and a tubular reabsorption maximum appeared to be present. Pepsinogen C may, therefore, be a new marker of tubular function. The cause of the remarkable difference in tubular handling of two quite similar low-molecular-mass proteins remains to be elucidated.\r"

Most laboratory managers make the mistake of purchasing a larger analyzer than is required. The cost of this mistake is not just the usually higher purchase price. Larger and higher speed instruments tend to be more complex, requiring better-trained operators and necessitating more maintenance. In addition, they tend to be less flexible for meeting STAT needs and more difficult to bring out of the stand-by mode. For the smaller laboratory, the oversized analyzer not only raises the operating requirements, but potentially lowers the service capabilities. A careful analysis of the laboratory's workflow and production issues may also do more than help clarify the instrumentation issues. Often an audit of how work is processed will uncover new ways to organize and perform the testing. Instead of a new analyzer solving the perceived problem, the solution that has the most impact may not involve any capital acquisition at all. However, even when the decision reached results in new instrumentation, a better understanding of how the new machine should function in the laboratory's environment will only improve its effectiveness in addressing the need.\r"

Ten of the gall stone patients had been treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and eight with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) three to four weeks before cholecystectomy. The hexosamine content was significantly higher in gall stone patients (137 (19) ng/ml, mean (SE) than in gall stone free subjects (83 (9) ng/ml, p less than 0.02). Treatment with CDCA or UDCA decreased cholesterol saturation, but did not significantly affect the hexosamine concentration. There was no difference in hexosamine concentration between gall stone patients with and without cholesterol crystals. The results do not support the hypothesis that the degree of cholesterol saturation is important for the mucin content of gall bladder bile in man. Neither do the data indicate that the formation and occurrence of cholesterol crystals in gall bladder bile from gall stone patients is caused by an increased concentration of mucin. As the studies were conducted on patients who had already had gall stones for several years, however, an effect of mucin in the very early stage of gall stone formation cannot be completely excluded.\r"

This may indicate the existence of a threshold effect where virtually all non-vegetarian women in affluent societies have a diet high in saturated fat, animal protein, and simple sugar to the extent that it is not possible to distinguish between cases and controls. In women with newly discovered gall stones, the prevalence of upper gastrointestinal symptoms was no different from that in the controls.

Clusters of RFD9+ cells (epithelioid cells) were found in Crohn's colitis and, to a lesser extent, in ulcerative colitis. Some Crohn's colitis sections showed replacement of the normal colonic macrophage phenotype with RFD1-RFD7+ cells (classical scavenger macrophages). The degree of this replacement correlated with the histological severity of the disease. By contrast, large numbers of RFD1+ RFD7- cells, with long dendritic processes, were found in intimate association with the lymphoid infiltrates in the lamina propria of the ulcerative colitis sections. Future studies of the factors controlling macrophage differentiation in tissues may help to explain the greater macrophage heterogeneity in inflammatory bowel disease and the differences between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis observed in this study.\r"

The major SCFA in all groups were acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. A significantly higher ratio of acetate to total SCFA and lower ratio of butyrate to total SCFA was found for polyp-colon cancer subjects than for normal subjects. There were no significant differences in the ratios of acetate, propionate, or butyrate between the diverticulosis or inflammatory bowel groups and the normal group. There were no significant sex differences nor were there correlations with the ratios of acetate, propionate or butyrate and age, subject weight, or dry weights of samples. Significant differences in concentrations of individual acids were found between normal and certain diagnostic groups. The difference in proportions of individual SCFA between groups suggest differences in fermentation patterns of the colonic microflora.\r"

  ".W": "GABA, best known as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is also present in various peripheral tissues including the gastrointestinal tract, where there is strong evidence that GABA acts as a transmitter in some intrinsic myenteric neurones. Several studies indicate that the gastric mucosa is one of the sites of action of GABA in the gut. Highly specific anti-GABA antibodies have been used to detect endogenous GABA in the mucosa of the rat gastrointestinal tract, and 3H-GABA uptake followed by autoradiography has been used to localise cells with uptake sites for exogenous GABA. It was found that although GABA immunoreactive nerve fibres are essentially absent from this site, some mucosal cells are strongly GABA-immunoreactive. These cells are common in the pyloric stomach and upper part of the small intestine. The autoradiographic experiments provide evidence that these cells also possess high-affinity GABA uptake sites. These observations raise the possibility that in the gastrointestinal tract GABA acts as a gut hormone in a subpopulation of mucosal endocrine cells, in addition to its role as an enteric neurotransmitter.\r"

The intestinal segments of the senescent rats contained higher mucosal mass and protein content (p less than 0.05) compared with the young and mature animals. A significant reduction of villus height and crypt depth (p less than 0.05) was found in the proximal intestine during aging. A 35% increase in villus height (p less than 0.05) without changes in crypt depth, was observed in the distal ileum in senescent rats. The activities of sucrase and isomaltase were significantly increased during aging in the duodenum and jejunum (p less than 0.05). Lactase and aminopeptidase activities which showed only minor changes between young and mature animals were significantly enhanced in senescent animals (p less than 0.05) with aminopeptidase exhibiting a three-fold increase in activity in the proximal ileum. The results when combined with those of previous studies suggest that in the aged animal, the increased level of intestinal hydrolase activities may be the consequence of prolonged cellular maturation along the villi in the proximal intestine, and of adaptation to increased concentrations of intraluminal substrates in the distal intestine.\r"

Five semi-synthetic amphipathic analogues of pepstatin, prepared by N terminal substitution of native pepstatin with hydrophilic oligopeptides, have been assessed for their ability to protect the mucosa in two animal models of acute gastric erosions. Concentrations of approximately 90 pmol/mg were achieved in the rat gastric mucosa after oral administration of a 20 mmol solution. These levels are theoretically adequate to inhibit all pepsin like proteinase activity (including zymogens). Each pepstatin analogue was tested by intragastric administration in a controlled hypotension/luminal acid animal model of acute gastric erosions in a group of six animals. All the inhibitors tested produced marked mucosal protection, as measured by a mucosal damage index, compared with control animals (control mean 241, range 100-420; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Orn-Orn-Cys (10 mmol) mean 3, range 0-8, p less than 0.01; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Cysteic acid-Cysteic acid (10 mmol) mean 5, range 0-21, p less than 0.01; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Lys-Lys (10 mmol) mean 18, range 0-60, p less than 0.01; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Cysteic acid-Cysteic acid (1 mmol) mean 24, range 0-86, p less than 0.01; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Orn-Orn-Cys (1 mmol) mean 57, range 0-116, p less than 0.01; Pepstatinyl-Gly-Asp-Asp (1 mg/ml suspension) mean 68, range 19-126, p less than 0.01; Pepstatinyl-Arg-OMe (1 mmol) mean 93, range 4-142, p less than 0.05, Pepstatinyl-Gly-Lys-Lys (1 mmol) mean 157, range 70-286, NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Stressors were: a video arcade game, delayed audio feedback, and hand immersion in cold water. Each stress period was followed by five swallows of water. Frequency and amplitude of oesophageal contractions and the number of simultaneous and multipeaked contractions were manually counted for each stress period and compared to the preceding rest period. Frequency of contractions (per minute) tended to decrease during stress periods, but achieved significance only with the video arcade game in the control group (2.0 (0.6) v 1.2 (0.4); p less than 0.01). No other trend was evident in either control or IBS patients. No abnormalities of oesophageal body function were recorded in IBS patients either in basal conditions, or under stress. Unlike the more complex motor programmes elsewhere in the gut, the preprogrammed nature of oesophageal peristalsis is not modulated by stress.\r"

The PAF receptor antagonists, SRI 63-441 (2.6 X 10(-4) M) and L659,989 (1 X 10(-5) M), were the major investigative tools. In isolated perfused rat lungs, both agents caused a persistent increase in base-line perfusion pressure (Ppa), potentiated angiotensin II (ANG II) vasoconstriction, and potentiated hypoxic vasoconstriction (HPV). This potentiation of ANG II and HPV was found to be independent of circulating blood elements. Vasodilation in the presence of PAF blockade was also impaired. The combination of cyclooxygenase inhibition and PAF receptor blockade had an additive effect on ANG II vasoconstriction but did not cause more potentiation of HPV than achieved with PAF antagonism alone. In vivo, SRI 63-441 (10 mg/kg) caused only a transient increase in base-line Ppa without altering ANG II and hypoxic vasoconstriction. These findings support a vasodilatory role for endogenous PAF in the pulmonary circulation.\r"

Beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol or muscarinic blockade with atropine given intravenously had no effect on the histamine tachyphylaxis. Duration of thiamylal anesthesia did not alter the histamine responsiveness. Histamine tachyphylaxis was also seen with chloralose-urethan anesthesia. Since tachyphylaxis is not observed with acetylcholine, it cannot be attributed to a general decline in muscle contractility. We conclude that histamine tachyphylaxis in vivo is not explained by effects of cholinergic reflexes, catecholamine release, duration of anesthesia, or, probably, type of anesthetic agent.\r"

Maximum velocity of isotonic relaxation was linearly related to the extent of shortening (r = 0.90). To quantify the degree of load sensitivity, we measured the tRi, i.e., the ratio of time at which the isometric relaxation of the twitch afterloaded at 50% of the isometric peak active tension began to time at which the isometric twitch was relaxed to 50% of the isometric peak active twitch tension. tRi was 0.76 +/- 0.03 (SE) in control conditions but significantly increased to 0.91 +/- 0.02 after ryanodine, which is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function, and to 0.89 +/- 0.03 after fatigue. These results suggest that in adult rat diaphragm, as in cardiac muscle, the load sensitivity of relaxation requires a well-functioning SR and that the relaxation abnormalities observed in fatigued diaphragm are related to a dysfunction of the SR.\r"

There was a significant increase in the dose of isoproterenol required to increase heart rate by 25 min-1 and decrease in slope of heart rate increase vs. log(dose) relationship in conditions H2 and H3. Thus an hypoxia-related attenuated response of beta-adrenergic receptors to exogenous stimulation was found in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Standard cold tests were performed in nude subjects, lying for 2 h in a climatic chamber at three ambient air temperatures (10, 5, and 1 degrees C). The level of physical fitness conditioned the intensity of thermoregulatory reactions to cold. For all subjects, there was a direct relationship between physical fitness and 1) metabolic heat production, 2) level of mean skin temperature (Tsk), 3) level of skin conductance, and 4) level of Tsk at the onset of shivering. The predominance of thermogenic or insulative reactions depended on the intensity of the cold stress: insulative reactions were preferential at 10 degrees C, or even at 5 degrees C, whereas colder ambient temperature (1 degree C) triggered metabolic heat production abilities, which were closely related to the subject's physical fitness level. Fit subjects have more efficient thermoregulatory abilities against cold stress than unfit subjects, certainly because of an improved sensitivity of the thermoregulatory system.\r"

This study was designed to examine whether administration of aerosols of various tonicity to alter airway surface fluid osmolarity would induce similar blood flow changes. Tracheobronchial blood flow was measured by the radioactive microsphere technique in six anesthetized dogs ventilated with warm humid air (100% relative humidity) for 15 min (period 1), air containing ultrasonically nebulized saline aerosol (1,711 mosmol/kg) for 3 min (period 2) and 12 min (period 3), and the same aerosol at a higher nebulizer output for a further 3 min (period 4). Between periods 3 and 4, the dogs were ventilated with warm humid air for 30 min to reestablish base-line conditions. In another five dogs, measurements were made after 30 min of ventilation with 1) warm humid air, 2) isotonic saline aerosol, 3) warm humid air, 4) distilled water aerosol (3 dogs), and hypertonic saline aerosol (2 dogs). After the last measurement was made, each dog was killed, the trachea and major bronchi were excised, and blood flow was calculated. No change in blood flow was found during any period of aerosol inhalation. The osmolar load imposed on the airways was estimated and was similar to that occurring during cold or dry air hyperventilation. These data suggest that increasing osmolarity of airway surface fluid does not explain the blood flow changes seen during hyperventilation of cold or dry air.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils recruited to different tissues undergo respiratory burst activity at widely different PO2 levels. The present study investigated the in vitro effects of PO2 on neutrophil oxidative metabolism. When neutrophils were stimulated with either zymosan or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) under different PO2's (0-700 Torr), hexose monophosphate shunt activity, H2O2, and hydroxyl radical (OH.) production were directly related to the level of PO2. Neutrophils functioned surprisingly well at PO2's as low as 10 Torr, where metabolic burst activity was prolonged and usually exceeded 50% of maximal values. The production of neutrophil stable oxidants and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) by zymosan-stimulated neutrophils was also directly related to PO2. In contrast, the production of stable oxidants and HOCl by PMA-stimulated neutrophils was significantly higher at 10 Torr compared with 700 Torr. The decrease in stable oxidant production by PMA-stimulated neutrophils at elevated PO2's was explained by both increased destruction of stable oxidant products and by decreased availability of the precursor HOCl. Superoxide dismutase and the OH. scavenger benzoate partially prevented the fall in stable oxidants at elevated PO2's. Measurements of stable oxidants in PMA-stimulated supernates generated at 10 and 700 Torr correlated with the ability of these supernates to decrease the elastase inhibitory capacity of the serum antiprotease alpha 1-antitrypsin. These findings suggest that different PO2's alter the magnitude and pattern of neutrophil oxidative metabolism.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a similar superficially located ventral region was present in the dog and to assess the role of each of the other regions in the canine medulla important in the control of breathing, in 20 anesthetized, vagotomized, and artificially ventilated dogs, a cryoprobe was used to cool selected regions of the medulla to 15-20 degrees C. Respiratory output was determined from phrenic nerve or diaphragm electrical activity. Cooling in or near the nucleus of the solitary tract altered timing and produced little change in the amplitude or rate of rise of inspiratory activity; lengthening of inspiratory time was the most common timing effect observed. Cooling in ventrolateral regions affected the amplitude and rate of rise of respiratory activity. Depression of neural tidal volume and apnea could be produced by unilateral cooling in two ventrolateral regions: 1) near the nucleus ambiguus and nucleus para-ambiguus and 2) just beneath the ventral medullary surface. These findings indicate that in the dog dorsomedial neural structures influence respiratory timing, whereas more ventral structures are important to respiratory drive.\r"

In this study we have investigated the effect of histamine. Anesthetized male guinea pigs were prepared with a chronically implanted intracerebroventricular (icv) cannula and instrumented for the measurement of pulmonary resistance (RL), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (f), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR). Administration of histamine (2-30 micrograms) icv caused a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction of Cdyn with no change in RL, VT, and f. At a dose of 100 micrograms icv, histamine caused an increase in RL (202 +/- 78%), a reduction of Cdyn (77 +/- 9%), an increase in f (181 +/- 64%), and a reduction of VT (53 +/- 18%). There were no changes in BP and HR after 100 micrograms of icv histamine. In contrast, intravenous administration of histamine (0.1-2 micrograms/kg) caused a dose-dependent decrease in Cdyn and increase in RL that was associated with tachypnea at each bronchoconstrictor dose. Intravenous histamine (2 micrograms/kg) produced a fall in BP and an increase in HR. The bronchoconstrictor responses to icv histamine were completely blocked by vagotomy and significantly reduced by atropine (0.1 mg/kg iv), whereas vagotomy and atropine did not block the bronchospasm due to intravenous histamine. Additional studies indicated that the pulmonary responses due to icv histamine (100 micrograms) were blocked by pretreatment with the H1-antagonist chlorpheniramine (1 and 10 micrograms, icv). These data indicate that histamine may serve a CNS neurotransmitter function in reflex bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs.\r"

Results showed that increasing frequency [at controlled arterial (PaCO2)] PCO2 from 16 to 32 breaths/min had no effect on either the rate of fall or the magnitude of the fall up to 1 h after the hyperinflation. However, increasing the tidal volume from 300 to 750 ml abolished the fall in Cdyn from 10 to 50 min after the hyperinflation; the fall within the first 10 min remained unchanged. We also examined the effect of a simulated \"hyperinflation\" on the compliance of strips of parenchymal tissue in vitro. This result indicated that in the absence of surface forces, parenchymal tissue demonstrates a fall in compliance, which is complete within 10 min. Overall our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the fall in Cdyn after hyperinflation is a two-phase process. The initial rapid fall in Cdyn (i.e., within 10 min) may simply represent a passive recovery process from the hyperinflation stress on the parenchymal tissue. The slower fall occurring after 10 min likely results from progressive increases in surface tension, and this increase can apparently be blocked by increases in tidal volume.\r"

Fourteen seminude subjects were immersed to the shoulders in 18 degrees C water for 90 min or until rectal temperature (Tre) decreased to 35.5 degrees C. Biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle and venous blood samples were obtained before and immediately after the immersion. Metabolic rate increased during the immersion to 3.5 +/- 0.3 (SE) times resting values, whereas Tre decreased by 0.9 degrees C to approximately 35.8 degrees C at the end of the immersion. Intramuscular glycogen concentration in the vastus lateralis decreased from 410 +/- 15 to 332 +/- 18 mmol glucose/kg dry muscle, with each subject showing a decrease (P less than 0.001). Plasma volume decreased (P less than 0.001) markedly during the immersion (-24 +/- 1%). After correcting for this decrease, blood lactate and plasma glycerol levels increased by 60 (P less than 0.05) and 38% (P less than 0.01), respectively, whereas plasma glucose levels were reduced by 20% after the immersion (P less than 0.001). The mean expiratory exchange ratio showed a biphasic pattern, increasing initially during the first 30 min of the immersion from 0.80 +/- 0.06 to 0.85 +/- 0.05 (P less than 0.01) and decreasing thereafter toward basal values. The results demonstrate clearly that intramuscular glycogen reserves are used as a metabolic substrate to fuel intensive thermogenic shivering activity of human skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Ventilation with O2 was previously shown to decrease whole-body and hindlimb muscle O2 uptake (VO2) in anesthetized dogs, particularly during anemia. To determine whether this was a purely local effect of hyperoxia (HiOx), we pump perfused isolated dog hindlimb muscles with autologous blood made hyperoxic (PO2 greater than 500 Torr) in a membrane oxygenator while the animals were ventilated with room air. Both constant-flow and constant-pressure protocols were used, and half the dogs were made anemic by exchange transfusion of dextran to hematocrit (Hct) approximately 15%. Thus there were four groups of n = 6 dogs each. A 30-min period of HiOx was preceded and followed by similar periods of perfusion with normoxic blood. In HiOx all four groups showed increased leg hindrance, increased leg venous PO2, and no significant changes in leg O2 inflow. Limb blood flow and VO2 decreased approximately 20% in HiOx with constant-pressure perfusion, regardless of Hct. In the constant-flow protocol, leg VO2 in HiOx was maintained by the anemic animals and actually increased in the normocythemic group. We conclude that HiOx directly affected vascular smooth muscle to cause flow restriction and maldistribution. Constant flow offset these effects, but the increased limb VO2 may have been a toxic effect. Anemia appeared to exaggerate the microcirculatory maldistribution caused by HiOx.\r"

We tested these possibilities by pump-perfusing innervated hindlimbs in eight dogs with autologous blood kept normoxic by a membrane oxygenator while ventilating the animals for 40 min with 9% O2 in N2 (NOB group). Similar periods of normoxic ventilation preceded and followed the hypoxic period. A second group (n = 8, beta B) was pretreated with the specific beta 2 blocker ICI 118,551. Hindlimb O2 uptake was elevated by 25 min of hypoxia in NOB, whereas whole-body O2 uptake was reduced. Limb O2 uptake remained elevated in recovery, but all effects on limb O2 uptake were absent in beta B. Hindlimb resistance and perfusion pressure increased in hypoxia in both groups, and there was little evidence of local escape from reflex vasoconstriction. These results clearly indicated that global hypoxia increased O2 demand in muscle when the local O2 supply was not limited and that beta 2-receptors were necessary for this response. Autoregulatory escape of limb muscle blood flow from centrally mediated vasoconstriction during whole-body hypoxia was also shown to be practically nil, if normoxia was maintained in the limb.\r"

We examined whether hypoxia, by promoting local vasodilation, further modified these effects in resting skeletal muscle and gut in anesthetized dogs after hematocrit had been raised to 65%. One group (CON, n = 7) served as normoxic controls while another (HH, n = 6) was ventilated with 9% O2--91% N2 for 30 min between periods of normoxia. Polycythemia decreased cardiac output so that QO2 to both regions decreased approximately 50% in both groups. In compensation, O2 extraction fraction increased to 65% in muscle and to 50% in gut. When QO2 was reduced further during hypoxia, blood flow increased in muscle but not in gut. Unlike previously published normocythemic studies, there was no initial hypoxic vasoconstriction in muscle. Metabolic vasodilation during hypoxia was enhanced in muscle when blood O2 reserves were first lowered by increased extraction with polycythemia alone. The increase in resting muscle blood flow during hypoxia with no change in cardiac output may have decreased O2 availability to other more vital tissues. In that sense and under these experimental conditions, polycythemia caused a maladaptive response during hypoxic hypoxia.\r"

Gas concentrations were measured from the trachea and from a lower lobe bronchus in six baboons by mass spectrometry. Washouts using large tidal volumes approximated single exponential decays with the relative exponential rates of decay being He fastest, SF4 slowest, and N2 intermediate. Washouts using smaller tidal volumes demonstrated a two-phase exponential decay pattern. During the fast phase, the relative exponential rates of decay were He slowest, SF6 fastest, and N2 intermediate, the reverse order seen during large-volume washouts. During the slow phase, the relative exponential rates of decay were He fastest, SF4 slowest, and N2 intermediate, the same order seen during large-volume washouts. The magnitude of the first phase observed from the lower lobe bronchus was less than that observed from the trachea. These data are consistent with a serial two-compartment transport model incorporating a limitation of molecular diffusion between the peripheral and proximal compartments. The more rapid clearance of less diffusible gases from the central airways during the first phase of washout was due to slower transport from the alveoli to the central airways rather than faster transport from the central airways to the airway opening.\r"

This study was designed to determine whether activation of these afferents with use of capsaicin affects phrenic efferent activity. Capsaicin injections into the phrenic artery were made in 10 alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs after each of the following procedures performed in succession: bilateral cervical vagotomy, C7 spinal cord transection, bilateral cervical dorsal rhizotomy. In six of these animals injections were also made after C2 spinal cord transection and removal of the cervical spinal cord. Injections made in the vagotomized animals were associated with apneusis followed by hyperpnea. C7 spinal transection eliminated the hyperpneic response, but the apneusis remained. Cervical dorsal rhizotomy or C2 spinal cord transection failed to abolish the apneusis in response to injection. No diaphragm response was obtained after removal of the cervical spinal cord. Experiments in three additional animals showed that capsaicin does not have a direct excitatory effect on the muscle cells of the crural diaphragm, nor does it potentiate the release of neurotransmitter in the diaphragm. The results of this study indicate that small-fiber afferents in the diaphragm have an excitatory effect on phrenic motoneurons. There is a segmental component to this reflex, since the response is observed after C2 spinal cord transection. The data also suggest that at least some of these afferents enter the spinal cord through the ventral roots.\r"

The investigations were carried out in La Paz, Bolivia (3,650 m, 500 mmHg barometric pressure). Before hemodilution, a low ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) mode (VA/Q less than 0.1) without true shunt accounted for 11.6 +/- 5.5% of the total blood flow and was mainly responsible for the hypoxemia. The hypoventilation with a low mixed venous PO2 value may have contributed to the observed hypoxemia in the absence of an impairment in alveolar capillary diffusion. After hemodilution, cardiac output and ventilation increased from 5.5 +/- 1.2 to 6.9 +/- 1.2 l/min and from 8.5 +/- 1.4 to 9.6 +/- 1.3 l/min, respectively, although arterial and venous PO2 remained constant. VA/Q mismatching fell slightly but significantly. The hypoxemia observed in subjects suffering from high-altitude excessive polycythemia was attributed to an increased in blood flow perfusing poorly ventilated areas, but without true intra- or extrapulmonary shunt. Hypoventilation as well as a low mixed venous PO2 value may also have contributed to the observed hypoxemia.\r"

HbCO produced a fetal tachycardia. Mean arterial blood pressure was only increased during severe HbCO. The incidences of rapid eye movements and breathing activity were decreased by HbCO in a dose-dependent manner. When related to calculated brain tissue PO2, these decreases were similar to those measured during hypoxic hypoxia and anemia, suggesting that carboxyhemoglobin effects result solely from diminished oxygenation. It is concluded that 1) the peripheral arterial chemoreceptors in the fetus apparently have little effect on hypoxic inhibition of breathing and 2) the carboxyhemoglobin concentrations required to inhibit fetal breathing are greater than those likely to be encountered clinically.\r"

  ".W": "Patency of the upper airway (UA) is usually considered to be maintained by the activity of muscles in the head and neck. These include cervical muscles that provide caudal traction on the UA. The thorax also applies caudal traction to the UA. To observe whether this thoracic traction can also improve UA patency, we measured resistance of the UA (RUA) during breathing in the presence and absence of UA muscle activity. Fifteen anesthetized dogs breathed through tracheostomy tubes. RUA was calculated from the pressure drop of a constant flow through the isolated UA. RUA decreased 31 +/- 5% (SEM) during inspiration. After hyperventilating seven of these dogs to apnea, we maximally stimulated the phrenic nerves to produce paced diaphragmatic breathing. Despite absence of UA muscle activity, RUA fell 51 +/- 11% during inspiration. Graded changes were produced by reduced stimulation. In six other dogs we denervated all UA muscles. RUA still fell 25 +/- 7% with inspiration in these spontaneously breathing animals. When all caudal ventrolateral cervical structures mechanically linking the thorax to the UA were severed, RUA increased and respiratory fluctuations ceased. These findings indicate that tonic and phasic forces generated by the thorax can improve UA patency. Inspiratory increases in UA patency cannot be attributed solely to activity of UA muscles.\r"

Paired control endotoxemia experiments (E) and endotoxemia with verapamil treatment (30-60 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) experiments (V + E) were conducted on each sheep in random order. In the V + E experiments sheep were pretreated with a continuous intravenous infusion of verapamil 1.5-2.0 h before endotoxin infusion (1.0 microgram/kg, given over 15 min). Verapamil significantly increased base-line pulmonary arterial pressure, left atrial pressure, lung lymph flow rate, and circulating blood leukocyte levels and significantly decreased base-line cardiac output. During the endotoxin response, verapamil significantly attenuated both phase I pulmonary arterial hypertension and phase II lung lymph flow rate compared with control endotoxin experiments. The results indicate that verapamil attenuates both the pulmonary hemodynamic and increased lung microvascular permeability response to endotoxin in sheep. In a series of in vitro experiments, verapamil was found to be a potent inhibitor of phorbol myristate acetate-induced superoxide production in isolated sheep granulocytes. These data suggest that the beneficial in vivo effects of verapamil during endotoxemia may in part be due to its inhibition of increased free cytosol calcium concentration and/or inhibition of toxic O2 metabolite production.\r"

The maximal contractile responses (20 V, 0.5 ms, 64 Hz) for either field or vagal stimulation were completely abolished by atropine (60 nM). Hexamethonium (0.1 mM) abolished the response to vagal stimulation but did not affect the field-stimulated response. To compare the effectiveness of atropine and pirenzepine as antagonists at the nerve-smooth muscle junction, inhibition studies of field-stimulated contractions were performed. Pirenzepine was 102- to 178-fold less potent than atropine when compared at the inhibitory concentration of antagonist that produced 25, 50, and 75% inhibition (IC25, IC50, and IC75, respectively), indicating that the muscarinic receptor at the nerve-smooth muscle junction is a muscarinic receptor with low affinity for pirenzepine (M2 subtype). Atropine had similar inhibitory effects on vagal- and field-stimulated contractions. In contrast, pirenzepine was more potent in inhibiting vagally stimulated contraction than field-stimulated contraction, especially at the IC25 where pirenzepine was only 8- to 22-fold less potent than atropine in inhibiting vagally stimulated contraction. These data suggest that an M1 subtype of muscarinic receptor modulates excitatory neurotransmission through bronchial parasympathetic ganglia.\r"

To quantify surfactant loss via this pathway, latex bags were surgically placed into the abdomens of adult rabbits such that secretions cleared via the esophagus could be collected. The rabbits then were given treatment or trace doses of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine-surfactant by tracheal injection and/or intravascular radiolabeled precursors of phosphatidylcholine. Labeled saturated phosphatidylcholine was measured in all fluids that were collected from the bags at 2-h intervals for 24 h and in alveolar washes and lung tissues at 24 h. No more than 7% of either treatment or trace doses of intratracheal surfactant-saturated phosphatidylcholine was lost via clearance up the airways over 24 h. Clearances of endogenously synthesized and secreted saturated phosphatidylcholine were estimated to be no more than 3% of the flux of labeled saturated phosphatidylcholine through the alveolar pool. These experiments demonstrate that surfactant phosphatidylcholine clearance via movement up the airways is not a major pathway leading to surfactant catabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Although there is considerable evidence that the H fields of Forel of the posterior diencephalon play an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular function, little is known about the role these areas play in the control of airway caliber. In chloralose-anesthetized paralyzed dogs, we used both electrical and chemical means to stimulate the H fields of Forel, while we monitored breath-by-breath changes in total lung resistance (TLR), a functional index of airway caliber. Electrical stimulation (200-250 microA, 80 Hz, 0.75 ms) of 82 histologically confirmed sites significantly decreased TLR from 9.2 +/- 0.4 to 7.9 +/- 0.4 cmH2O.l-1.s (P less than 0.01). The bronchodilation evoked by electrical stimulation was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol but was abolished by cholinergic blockade with atropine. The increases in airway caliber evoked by stimulation were often accompanied by increases in phrenic nerve activity. Chemical stimulation of 21 of 82 sites with microinjections of DL-homocysteic acid (83 nl, 0.2 and 0.5 M), which stimulates cell bodies but not fibers of passage, also decreased TLR from 8.3 +/- 0.5 to 7.3 +/- 0.5 cmH2O.l-1.s (P less than 0.03). We conclude that stimulation of cell bodies in the H fields of Forel produces bronchodilation by withdrawal of cholinergic tone to airway smooth muscle.\r"

Vascular endothelial permeability was assessed by use of the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c). A predicted pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc,p) was calculated from measurements of postcapillary resistances. These parameters were measured before and 90 min after the administration of PMA, either intratracheally or intravascularly. When blood elements were present both intratracheal and intravascular PMA caused an increased Kf,c [0.27 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.99 +/- 0.22 and 0.25 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.15 (SE) ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g-1, respectively; P less than 0.05] and an increased Ppc,p (8.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 74.7 +/- 18.3 and 8.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 74.2 +/- 25.1 cmH2O, respectively; P less than 0.05).

Three conditions were studied: run A: transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), 65% Pdimax; esophageal pressure (Pes), 60% Pesmax; run B: Pdi, 50% Pdimax; Pes, 60% Pesmax; and run C: Pdi, 50% Pdimax; Pes, 20% Pesmax. During all runs there was a progressive rise in sensation, which was greater in runs A and B than in run C (P less than 0.05, analysis of variance). There was no difference between runs A and B. At the end of run C subjects did not report a maximal Borg score despite their inability to generate the target Pdi. The increase in sensory score with fatigue correlated highly with Esm/Esmmax and with Erc/Ercmax. There was no correlation between sensory score and Edi/Edimax. We conclude that the increase in respiratory effort sensation that accompanies diaphragm fatigue is not due to perception of increased diaphragmatic activation. It may reflect increased overall respiratory motor output not directed to the diaphragm.\r"

Therefore, we studied resting cardiac vagal activity by evaluating respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and examined carotid-cardiac baroreflex responsiveness with a neck collar in 11 high-fit and 9 sedentary [based on maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) and history of physical activity] healthy young men (19-31 yr of age). Resting cardiac vagal activity was determined from the standard deviation of 100 consecutive resting R-R intervals. Baroreflex responsiveness was determined from the R-R interval responses to neck suction and pressure (repeated trials of 5-s stimuli of -20, -40, and 35 mmHg). Both RSA and the bradycardic (R-R interval) responses to neck suction of -40 mmHg were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in the high-fit individuals (RSA, 116.5 +/- 11.5 ms; neck-suction response, 145.3 +/- 17.0 ms; mean +/- SE) compared with sedentary subjects (RSA, 65.2 +/- 6.6 ms; neck-suction response, 86.9 +/- 12.5 ms). Responses of the high-fit volunteers to the other intensities of neck stimuli (-20 and 35 mmHg) showed a similar trend but were not significantly different from those of the sedentary volunteers. The baroreflex slope derived from these data was significantly greater in the high-fit subjects (4.00 +/- 0.39 ms/mmHg) compared with the sedentary controls (2.53 +/- 0.28 ms/mmHg). These data suggest that resting cardiac vagal activity is greater, carotid-to-cardiac activity is well maintained, and baroreflex sensitivity, i.e., slope, is augmented in high-fit subjects.\r"

The injury was neutrophil independent because it occurred in neutropenic rats. AmB produced vasoconstriction and injury in isolated lungs perfused with a cell- and plasma-free physiological solution, and this injury was independent of pulmonary perfusion pressure. In vivo administration of AmB produced an increase in lung tissue and plasma-oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG) indicative of oxidant stress. In the isolated lung, the radical scavengers p-hydroxybenzoate (methylparaben) and catalase attenuated AmB lung injury as did 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidone (Phenidone), a combined radical scavenger and lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and the leukotriene antagonist CGP 35949B. Methylparaben and CGP 35949B prevented the elevation in lung tissue leukotriene C4 and B4 levels noted after AmB. We conclude that AmB in the rat produces neutrophil-independent lung injury, which is associated with oxidant stress and eicosanoid production.\r"

Increases in intra-abdominal pressure (Pab) that are generated by diaphragmatic contraction are indirectly applied to the inner rib cage wall in the zone of apposition. We explored this mechanism, with the expectation that pleural pressure in this zone (Pap) would increase during inspiration and that local transdiaphragmatic pressure in this zone (Pdiap) must be different from conventionally determined transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during inspiration. Direct measurements of Pap, as well as measurements of pleural pressure (Ppl) cephalad to the zone of apposition, were made during tidal inspiration, during phrenic stimulation, and during inspiratory efforts in anesthetized dogs. Pab and esophageal pressure (Pes) were measured simultaneously. By measuring Ppl's with cannulas placed through ribs, we found that Pap consistently increased during both maneuvers, whereas Ppl and Pes decreased. Whereas changes in Pdi of up to -19 cmH2O were measured, Pdiap never departed from zero by greater than -4.5 cmH2O. We conclude that there can be marked regional differences in Ppl and Pdi between the zone of apposition and regions cephalad to the zone. Our results support the concept of the zone of apposition as an anatomic region where Pab is transmitted to the interior surface of the lower rib cage.\r"

Mean values were 40 +/- 6% (SE) for delta Vrc and 62 +/- 8% of VT for delta Vdi. The difference between VT and changes in thoracic cavity volume was taken to represent a change in thoracic blood volume (2 +/- 3% of VT). To estimate how much of delta Vrc was caused by diaphragmatic contraction and how much of delta Vdi was caused by rib cage motion, delta Vrc and delta Vdi were determined during bilateral stimulation of the C5-C6 phrenic nerve roots in the apneic dog and again during spontaneous breathing after phrenicotomy. Thoracic cavity volume (Vth) measured during hypocapnic apnea was consistently larger than Vth at end expiration, suggesting that relaxation of expiratory muscles contributed significantly to both delta Vrc and delta Vdi during spontaneous inspiration. Phrenic nerve stimulation did not contribute to delta Vrc, suggesting that diaphragmatic contraction had no net expanding action on the rib cage above the zone of apposition. Spontaneous breathing after phrenicotomy resulted in small and inconsistent diaphragmatic displacement (8 +/- 4% of VT). We conclude that the diaphragm does not drive the rib cage to inflate the lungs and that rib cage motion does not significantly affect diaphragmatic position during spontaneous breathing in anesthetized dogs lying supine.\r"

Histamine and thrombin caused a rapid transient elevation in [Ca2+]i in the EC of all the human blood vessels tested. In aortic EC, [Ca2+]i also rose in response to ATP and bradykinin. It was shown that in bovine pulmonary artery EC [Ca2+]i rises in response to platelet-activating factor (PAF) and thrombin. For a more detailed investigation of the receptor-mediated mechanism of [Ca2+]i increase in EC we used histamine as a stimulating agent. Histamine effects were seen at concentrations ranging from 5 X 10(-7) to 10(-4) M [50% effective dose (ED50) approximately 2-4 microM)] and were mediated by H1-receptors. The histamine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was not markedly diminished when the extracellular calcium was bound by excess ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). The data obtained indicate that the histamine effect is best explained by Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. The histamine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was not influenced by elevating the intracellular levels of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) or cyclic guanylic acid (cGMP) by use of isobutylmethylxanthine and forskolin or by nitroprusside preincubation, respectively. However, the protein kinase C stimulator, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), strongly inhibits [Ca2+]i elevation. It is assumed that a negative feedback mechanism that blocks receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i increase is triggered as a result of the activation of protein kinase C.\r"

Groups of three animals were exercised for 1 h/day at a treadmill speed of 8.5 m/min, with 1-min sprints at 15 m/min every 10 min. This exercise protocol led to a significant increase in the activity of G4 AChe in fast-twitch (gracilis and tibialis) but not in slow-twitch (soleus) muscles. Other AChe forms and muscle protein content remained unaltered. Such a selective enzymatic change was detected after a single exercise session, became more apparent after three daily sessions, and persisted for at least 30 days of exercise. A larger increment in G4 AChe activity was observed in gracilis muscle end-plate vs. non-end-plate regions. These findings show a specific adaptive reaction of fast-twitch muscles to enhanced motor activity, suggest that individual AChe forms in motor end plates are regulated through separate mechanisms, and support the hypothesis that membrane-bound G4 AChe plays an essential role in neuro-muscular transmission.\r"

Piezoelectric crystals were implanted on right costal and left crural diaphragms of anesthetized dogs, via midline laparatomy. With the abdomen reclosed, diaphragm lengths were recorded at five lung volumes. Contractile properties of excised muscle bundles were then measured. In vitro force-frequency and length-tension characteristics of the costal and crural diaphragms were virtually identical; their optimal force values were 2.15 and 2.22 kg/cm2, respectively. In situ, at residual volume, functional residual capacity (FRC), and total lung capacity the costal diaphragm lay at 102, 95, and 60% of optimal length (Lo), whereas the crural diaphragm lay at 88, 84, and 66% of Lo. Muscle cross-sectional area was 40% greater in costal than in crural diaphragms. Considering in situ lengths, cross-sectional areas, and in vitro length-tension characteristics at FRC, the costal diaphragm could exert 60% more force than the crural diaphragm.\r"

The compliance matrix and the experiments required to determine the entries in this matrix and thereby to describe the mechanical properties of the relaxed chest wall are described. The effective forces exerted by external loads and muscle tension are defined. The formal theory is used to identify relations among variables. From the definition of effective force, it follows that the ratio of the forces exerted by the diaphragm on the rib cage and abdomen is the same as the ratio of the dependence of diaphragm length on rib cage and abdominal volumes. As an example of relations among variables that follow from the symmetry of the compliance matrix, it is shown that the change of gastric pressure caused by raising pleural pressure is related to the change in lung volume caused by changing stomach volume.\r"

The experiments reported here with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) spectroscopy attempt to examine cellular mechanisms that might be responsible for this deterioration in mechanical performance. Specifically they describe certain characteristics of this preparation and cautions needed to study the resting in vitro rat diaphragm with such techniques. Second, they report the response of intracellular pH (pHi), phosphocreatine (PCr), ATP, and inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the resting in vitro rat diaphragm exposed to long-term normocapnia or to long-term hypercapnia. The results show that 1) to maintain a viable preparation, it was necessary to keep the diaphragm extended to an area approximating that at functional residual capacity, 2) the diaphragm seemed quite capable of maintaining a constant pHi and constant contents of ATP and Pi during normocapnia, but there was a gradual decline in PCr, and 3) during hypercapnia there was a significant decrease in pHi, but the behavior of the phosphate metabolites was exactly as during normocapnia. The results suggest that the decrease in mechanical performance of the diaphragm is probably not due to a decrease in the availability of the high-energy phosphates, although they do not completely exclude this possibility or possibilities related to regional compartmentation.\r"

  ".W": "When exposed to hypercapnia, several muscles deteriorate with respect to their mechanical performance. Exposure to metabolic acidosis and, perhaps surprisingly, to compensated metabolic acidosis has the same effect on the diaphragm. The mechanisms involved in these effects remain unclear. If the diaphragmatic intracellular pH (pHi) is assumed to decrease with hypercapnia, to remain unchanged during metabolic acidosis, and to increase during compensated metabolic acidosis, it would appear that different mechanisms must be responsible for the depreciation in the diaphragm's mechanical performance. The present experiments using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) spectroscopy were undertaken to determine the effect of metabolic acidosis and compensated metabolic acidosis on pHi and on high-energy phosphate metabolites in the resting rat diaphragm. A whole diaphragm was slightly stretched while being stitched onto a fiberglass mesh. The area approximated that at functional residual capacity. It was superfused in the NMR sample tube with a phosphate-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution [( HCO3-] = 6 meqO equilibrated with either 95% O2-5% CO2 or 98.75% O2-1.25% CO2). Spectra were acquired during 15-min intervals for control (30 min of normal Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate superfusate, equilibrated with 95% O2-5% CO2), for 120 min of exposure to either form of acidosis and for 60 min of recovery with normal superfusate. The pHi decreased rapidly during metabolic acidosis but did not change significantly during compensated metabolic acidosis. In both forms of acidosis, phosphocreatine declined gradually but not significantly, whereas ATP and inorganic phosphate did not change at all. The results suggest that HCO3- passes freely through the diaphragmatic sarcolemma, very much like the cardiac sarcolemma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Strength training was performed 3 days/wk for 10 wk, whereas endurance training remained constant during this phase. After 10 wk, leg strength was increased by an average of 30%, but thigh girth and biopsied vastus lateralis muscle fiber areas (fast and slow twitch) and citrate synthase activities were unchanged. Maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) was also unchanged by heavy-resistance training during cycling (55 ml.kg-1.min-1) and treadmill running (60 ml.kg-1.min-1); however, short-term endurance (4-8 min) was increased by 11 and 13% (P less than 0.05) during cycling and running, respectively. Long-term cycling to exhaustion at 80% VO2max increased from 71 to 85 min (P less than 0.05) after the addition of strength training, whereas long-term running (10 km times) results were inconclusive. These data do not demonstrate any negative performance effects of adding heavy-resistance training to ongoing endurance-training regimens. They indicate that certain types of endurance performance, particularly those requiring fast-twitch fiber recruitment, can be improved by strength-training supplementation.\r"

Control animals were raised in normal-sized litters and then fed standard rat chow. Compared with controls, obese rats had significant elevations in body weight (31%), fat pad weight (158%), fat pad weight-to-body weight ratio (97%), snout-to-anus length (8%), snout-to-tail length (7%), serum insulin concentration (64%), fixed lung volume (56%), and the ratios of lung volume to body weight (18%) and lung volume to body length3 (24%). Lungs of obese rats had enlarged alveoli, with significant increases in mean (182%) and total (71%) alveolar volume, mean chord length (28%), and mean (89%) and total (25%) alveolar surface area. Surface density (24%), surface-to-volume2/3 ratio (24%), and numerical density (43-53%) of alveoli in obese rats were significantly diminished compared with lungs of control rats. Unchanged were total alveolar number and alveolar volume density. Measurements of perihilar and subpleural alveoli within the obese and control groups were indistinguishable. These results indicate the presence of alveolar enlargement with relatively diminished respiratory surface area in lungs of young rats made obese by diet. This relative decrease in gas-exchanging area may contribute to physiological and functional alterations present in obesity.\r"

The exercise program induced a significant increase in tendon collagen deposition (46%) without any changes in DNA, proteoglycan, and collagen concentrations or tendon dry weight. Also, tendon collagen from runners contained fewer (50%) pyridinoline cross-links.

These same properties were determined in a group of ground-based control rats housed under simulated environmental conditions. The wet weight of each of the flight muscles was significantly reduced relative to control. However, the loss of mass varied from 36% in the soleus to 15% in the extensor digitorum longus. The cross-sectional areas of fibers in the flight muscles also were reduced, except for the dark ATPase fibers in the medial gastrocnemius. The greatest relative fiber atrophy occurred in the muscles with the highest proportion of light ATPase fibers. An increase in the percentage of dark ATPase fibers also was observed in flight muscles with a predominance of light ATPase fibers. Also, there was an increase in the biochemically determined myofibrillar ATPase activity of tissue sections of the flight soleus. No changes in histochemical or biochemical measures of ATPase activity were observed in the flight extensor digitorum longus. In general, the SDH activity of flight muscles was maintained, whereas GPD activity either was maintained or increased. Based on a metabolic profile of ATPase, SDH, and GPD, there was an increase in the proportion of fast oxidative-glycolytic fibers in some muscles.\r"

Parameter values were obtained from models of transverse sections of muscles in which individual fibers were distributed in square-ordered arrays and capillaries were added to the perimeters of individual fibers in the arrays. Increasing the number of capillaries up to 2.0 per fiber increased hypoxic tolerance by 157% above that expected for a Krogh cylinder. However, increasing the number of capillaries from 2.0 to 4.0 per fiber increased hypoxic tolerance by only 18% and, assuming the entire perimeter of each fiber was perfused with blood, increased hypoxic tolerance by only 11% over the value obtained when capillary-to-fiber ratio was 4.0. Capillary growth during normal maturation may result in capillary-to-fiber ratios around 2.0, near the upper limit for producing marked changes in hypoxic tolerance. Therefore, capillary growth may not be an adaptive response to ambient hypoxia because there is little or no gas transport benefit derived from the additional capillaries.\r"

It is essentially a multijunction thermocouple (i.e., a multicouple) of type-T composition. Enamel-insulated copper wires (38 gauge) were soldered 5 mm apart to one common uninsulated constantan wire (36 gauge) and introduced into a polyethylene tube sealed at one end. The total outside diameter of the multicouple probe is less than 1 mm, and the maximum number of junctions using the specified wire sizes is approximately 16. This design permits the instantaneous measurement of a tissue temperature profile at 5-mm intervals over a distance of approximately 8 cm. An extensive calibration for the thermal conductivity effect (k effect) along the multicouple wires by means of a limb model is presented. The results show that the temperature readings of the individual junctions are significantly affected by the k effect when a thermal gradient exists along the multicouple, as is usually the case during tissue temperature measurements. However, calibration of the multicouple for the k effect yields a measurement accuracy of +/- 0.1 degree C under a wide range of gradients. This probe can be implanted in tissues to measure thermal gradients under different physiological conditions.\r"

  ".W": "A constant-load cycle ergometer was constructed that allows maximal power output to be measured for each one-half pedal revolution during brief, high-intensity exercise. To determine frictional force, an electronic load cell was attached to the resistance strap and the ergometer frame. Dead weights were attached to the strap's free end. Flywheel velocity was recorded by means of a magnetic switch and two magnets placed on the pedal sprocket. Pedaling resulted in magnetically activated switch closures, which produced two electronic pulses per pedal revolution. Pulses and load cell output were recorded (512 Hz), digitized, and stored on disk via microcomputer. Power output was later computed for each pair of adjacent pulses, representing average power per one-half pedal revolution. Power curves generated for each subject were analyzed for peak power output (the highest one-half pedal revolution average), time to peak power, power fatigue rate and index, average power, and total work. Thirty-eight males performed two 15-s tests separated by 15 min (n = 16) or 48 h (n = 22). Peak power output ranged from 846.0 to 1,289.1 W. Intraclass correlation analysis revealed high test-retest reliability for all parameters recorded on the same or different days (R = 0.91-0.97). No significant differences (P greater than 0.05) were noted between parameter means of the first and second tests. These results indicate that the ergometer described provides a means for conveniently and reliably assessing short-term power output and fatigue.\r"

In contrast the ITA showed only minimal cell loss. An ultrastructural morphometric analysis of the abluminal surface of the endothelium of both vessels showed significant differences in the numbers and depth of penetration of cytoplasmic processes or folds. Whereas the SV, perfusion-fixed at 110 mmHg, possessed relatively few (15/100 micron) and shallow (less than 1 micron deep) processes the ITA had significantly more (27/100 micron) and deeper (18% greater than 1 micron) processes. The ITA endothelial cells were also smaller and thicker. We suggest that the differences in the numbers and depth of the processes, which are believed to play a role in endothelial attachment, may account for the differing susceptibility of the two vessels to endothelial damage during grafting. This in turn correlates with the known susceptibility of SV grafts and resistance of ITA grafts to atherosclerotic changes.\r"

The first patient presented with an aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the common iliac arteries. The second patient presented with asymptomatic but progressive aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root. Both patients underwent the Bentall procedure using a 25 mm St. Jude composite valved conduit. Despite increased vascular friability, both of these patients tolerated the operative procedure without complication and are doing well on early follow-up.

Early infections (less than 14 days) were lower in the groups CTX-group (3%) compared to the BPC-group (16%) (p less than 0.046). In the groups receiving additional antibiotics for fever (CTX-ADD and BPC-ADD), the former had a significantly lower number of infections, 16 compared to 23, in the latter group (p less than 0.01). There were significantly fewer early infections in the CTX-ADD compared to the BPC-ADD group (4 vs. 10 respectively, p less than 0.01). No deep infections were seen when CTX or CTX-ADD was used, while 6 deep wound infections occurred when BPC or BPC-ADD was used. The lowest rate of positive cultures of bacteria was seen in the CTX-group (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Over a two year period, 67 patients undergoing carotid or aortic surgery were investigated preoperatively with dipyridamole-thallium scan. There were three positive scans in the first 17 patients; two of these patients suffered a postoperative myocardial infarction (one fatal), compared to none of 14 who had a negative scan (p = 0.02). There were seven positive scans in the next 50 patients. Patients with left main trunk or triple vessel disease were recommended to have coronary artery bypass prior to or combined with the vascular reconstruction. There were no deaths or postoperative myocardial infarction in this group, this improvement in morbidity being statistically significant (p = 0.01). Dipyridamole-thallium scanning is an effective screening procedure for coronary artery disease. Patients with a positive scan are at increased risk of postoperative myocardial infarction following vascular reconstruction. Further investigation with coronary arteriography prior to vascular reconstruction is recommended in patients with positive scans. Coronary artery bypass should be performed prior to or combined with the vascular reconstruction in patients with left main trunk or triple vessel disease.\r"

Post-operative sequential platelet counts using a Selo CSZ counter were undertaken, which demonstrated a substantial rise at the sites of CEA. These counts rose to peak levels between 7-88 minutes after declamping with a median peak time of 20 minutes. Continued high levels of labelled platelet accumulation persisted for 48-96 hours following CEA and in some instances persisted for three weeks. These studies suggest that antiplatelet agents should therefore be active when carotid declamping occurs and administered for at least three weeks following CEA.\r"

In 10 patients, protamine was used to reverse anticoagulation. These results were related to clinical parameters of age, renal function, plasma cholesterol, blood pressure, position of the aortic clamp and blood loss. High peak levels of heparin activity were more likely in patients with impaired renal function or high plasma cholesterol concentrations. Heparin activity was prolonged at therapeutic levels in patients with renal impairment, and in this group of patients the use of protamine was significantly increased as was the requirement for blood replacement.\r"

Competency can be restored by a vein valve transplant taken from the arm and placed in the popliteal fossa, with subjective and objective improvement. In this study 23 patients with post-phlebitic syndromes received 25 vein valve grafts as part of management. Seventeen patients had large recurrent ulcers after unsuccessful venous surgery: 6 patients had extensive pre-ulcer skin damage. Fifteen of 17 patients healed their ulcers, and all 6 patients with skin damage showed rapid improvement with relief of symptoms. Falls in the AVP, ranging from 10 to 40 mmHg occurred in 19 patients. All vein valve transplants were patent, after 18 months, but 5 grafted valves have evidence of venous reflux. These results suggest a functioning valve replacement in the popliteal fossa may lower the AVP sufficiently to heal intractable venous ulcers or severely damaged skin. Vein valve transplants function well long term, and the falls in the AVP are usually maintained. The popliteal fossa may be the ideal site since a component popliteal valve has been shown to limit adverse post-phlebitic changes.\r"

The superiority of autogenous vein was even more marked when anastomoses were to below knee vessels: 56% compared with 26% at 5 years. Grafts anastomosed to the superficial femoral artery had similar long term patency to those anastomosed to the common femoral artery. When grafts were required for severe ischaemia, similar 5 year patency rates were achieved with autogenous vein (35%) and modified human umbilical vein (30%). The 5 year limb salvage rate in severe ischaemia was 72% for autogenous vein and 63% for modified human umbilical vein. The findings confirm that modified human umbilical vein is a satisfactory alternative when autogenous vein is not available.\r"

The factors predicting death during 6-42 months follow-up were age and initial SPP; half the patients had died or under-gone amputation at 22 months. The information from the radioisotope clearance test is important in helping determine appropriate management for these patients and provides information not available from other methods, such as the ankle pressure measurement.\r"

In this study, the outcome of 189 consecutive patients who had major lower extremity amputations between 1978-1982 was compared to earlier reports from the same institution. Their cumulative survival of 52% at three years, was similar to the cumulative survival of 116 amputees whose surgery was done in 1966-1971. The risk of losing the second limb, almost 10% per year, was also similar to the earlier experience of 1966-1971. In 1964 one BK amputation was performed for every six above the knee. By 1980 this ratio had reversed to three BK for each AK amputation. When a ratio of BK:AK amputation greater than 2:1 was achieved in our patient population, using clinical criteria as the sole guide to amputation levels, one in four failed. The eventual ratio of healed BK to AK amputation achieved was little better than unity. A trend to below knee amputation was not associated with improvement of long term survival after lower extremity amputation for advanced arterial disease. These results indicate a need for better care of the vascular amputee and for a test to compliment clinical selection of amputation levels.\r"

Six patients had carcinoma complicating colitis and satisfactory samples were obtained from five; the cytological appearances were interpreted as carcinoma in three and as dysplasia in two. Seventy eight patients had not developed carcinoma or dysplasia; the cytological appearances were interpreted as negative for dysplasia in 75 and indefinite for dysplasia in three. In patients who had developed dysplasia the changes seemed to be more widespread on cytological rather than on histological examination. Brush cytology may complement histological assessment in patients with ulcerative colitis who have developed strictures or in whom there is a high suspicion of neoplastic change.\r"

Staining characteristics ranged from luminal staining in well differentiated, superficial lesions to staining of all cells in invasive carcinomas. Invasive tumour nests also stained strongly with the antibody. There was good correlation between the staining pattern and histological assessment of both tumours and mucosal biopsy specimens. Correlation with clinical course showed that it was also a good predictor of subsequent disease progression of superficial tumours. It is suggested that HMFG-2 staining is a sensitive indictor of malignant transformation and that it may have a role as an adjunct to conventional histological examination in the assessment of urothelial carcinomas.\r"

All these anatomical variants have to be distinguished from the pathologically enlarged carotid body that may have a smooth or finely nodular surface. Anatomical variants (such as the bilobed) may themselves enlarge as a consequence of carotid body hyperplasia.\r"

A new capillary viscometer (Coulter Viscometer II), which gives an automated measurement of plasma viscosity, was compared with the selected manual method (Harkness viscometer) of the International Committee for Standardization in Haematology. Automated measurement of plasma viscosity at 25 degrees C showed close correlation (r = 0.979, p less than 0.002) with the selected method for 160 specimens of plasma. Satisfactory precision both within batch and between batch (coefficients of variation of 1.7% or less) was obtained at viscosity values up to 5.7 mPa.s. There was no detectable carry over between samples and viscosity values were corrected adequately for ambient temperature for the range 15-32 degrees C. Careful daily cleaning was required to prevent accumulation of protein within the automatic sampling valve of the instrument. Automated measurement of plasma viscosity is an attractive alternative to measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\r"

A retrospective study was made of the history and prior treatment in 25 children who underwent mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma at St. Mary's Hospital between 1975 and 1986. Thirteen patients had undergone previous middle ear aeration procedures which included myringotomy, cortical mastoidectomy and grommets. There was no difference in the site or severity of cholesteatoma in the operated and non-operated cases. Of the seven patients with a history of multiple grommets three had primarily attic, and three had primarily mesotympanic disease. The latter had greater ossicular erosion. One patient with an intact tympanic membrane had grommet insertion subsequently developed a cholesteatoma. While cholesteatoma due directly to the presence of grommets is rare, it appears that children who require multiple grommet insertions constitute a high risk group and should be very closely monitored.\r"

Sixty-three of the 109 ears presented a marginal perforation or a retraction pocket, at the level of Shrapnell's membrane or beyond the postero-superior quadrant. In this group the cholesteatoma was distributed mainly in the attic and mastoid and was associated with a non-cellular mastoid. A second group comprising 31 ears presented with cholesteatoma behind an intact drum and were considered to be primary cholesteatomas. These were distributed mostly in the tympanic cavity as cystic epidermoid formations--their mastoid was usually pneumatized. Eight cholesteatomas were related to a central perforation. These ears presented features very similar to the primary cholesteatomas i.e., a pneumatized mastoid and tympanic cavity distribution. The similar features of this group make us think that they may have also originated as primary cholesteatomas which eventually perforated and bring the percentage of primary cholesteatomas in children to 38.3%. Seven of the 109 ears with cholesteatoma were of an indeterminate character.\r"

We present our management protocol as well as a survey of the routine management of acute epiglottitis in children in the five Scandinavian countries. The number of initially observed patients ranged from nil per cent in Iceland to 35 per cent in Finland. When an artificial airway is needed, 92-100 per cent of the patients are intubated, 0-8 per cent tracheostomized, and 0-5 per cent one or the other, as a standard procedure. Tracheostomy is performed in departments where the facilities do not permit sufficient observation of patients treated by intubation.\r"

A severe sore throat and dysphagia with disproportionate signs of oropharyngeal inflammation was the main presenting picture. Only three patients had stridor on presentation. Vigilant monitoring of the airway with empirical high-dose intravenous ampicillin, cloxacillin and steroids resulted in a dramatic clinical improvement in most patients and none developed stridor after admission.

It was found that the presence of middle ear effusions in the children was associated with an increased incidence of parental smoking. Those children with an abnormal tympanometry result were more likely to have at least one parent who smoked than those with normal tympanometry results. There was no relationship between resolution of the effusion and parental smoking. It is therefore suggested that as part of the management of this condition parents should be advised of the effects of smoking on the condition and encouraged to avoid smoking in the same environment as their children.\r"

In order to establish the relationship between motor and cognitive impairment in the disease, 20 non-demented HD patients were compared with 44 control subjects with respect to motor and cognitive performance. HD patients were significantly impaired in almost all cognitive functions in comparison with controls. Reaction time (RT) and movement time (MT) were considerably slower in HD patients when compared with controls and with patients with parkinsonism. Hyperkinesias did not correlate with cognitive impairment, but there was a good correlation between RT, MT and cognitive functions. Therefore, it seems that akinesia evaluated by RT and MT is an important sign in HD and proceeds at the same rate as mental decay.\r"

In one case the JC antibody titre was significantly higher in the CSF than the serum and we suggest that this finding is diagnostically useful. In this case there was a transient stabilization of the disease following treatment with cytarabine with a change in antibody titres suggestive of reduced viral replication in the central nervous system and a host response to the infection. In the other case, which was untreated, rising serum antibody levels indicated active infection with a host response.\r"

Neither the somatosensory nor the auditory evoked potentials exhibited any significant change of latencies, interpeak latencies or amplitudes.

Repeated recordings over a similar 10-h period on 3 consecutive days in one patients showed fairly constant measures of occurrence and intensity of tremor.

Established risk factors for myocardial infarction were measured prospectively. No significant difference between patients and control subjects in mean estradiol or testosterone level was observed. The only established risk factor that was significantly different was blood pressure, which was higher in the patients. Thus, the data did not confirm the hypothesis. However, two major pitfalls for prospective studies of estradiol in myocardial infarction, which might have affected the validity of the results, were observed, namely, deterioration of estradiol values with prolonged storage (8.5-12 years in this study) and intervention. The value of this study, therefore, may lie in pointing out difficulties in carrying out prospective studies on sex hormones.\r"

In a 12-month study on the occurrence of musculoskeletal problems in 966 runners (583 of whom completed the study), a proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates was used to assess factors associated with dropout at the various stages of the study. This approach allowed examination of baseline factors as well as the effect of change in mileage, the occurrence of a musculoskeletal problem, or the occurrence of another health problem on the rate of dropout. Those most likely to drop out of the study were younger and heavier at baseline and, prior to drop out, were less likely to experience general health problems and more likely to show a 40% decline in weekly running mileage in the month before dropout. Examination of factors associated with dropout is important since factors influencing dropout may also affect the study outcome for the risk factor analysis (a musculoskeletal problem severe enough to be seen by a physician). The results of the dropout analysis can be used to guide in the choice of analytic methods and to aid in the interpretation of the risk factor analyses.\r"

  ".W": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is strongly associated with both hypertension and diabetes. As both diabetes and hypertension tend to be familial, we hypothesized a familial clustering of ESRD cases. Using 114 cases from three dialysis centers and 99 controls, the exposure odds ratio was determined. Mantel-Haenszel analysis demonstrated that individual history of hypertension (ORmh = 5.14; 95% Cl = 2.29-11.56) and history of chronic renal failure in a first or second degree relative (chi 2mh = 5.12; p less than 0.05) were significant \"risk\" factors for being dialysed for ESRD, while family history of hypertension posed a more questionable risk (ORmh = 1.92 95% Cl 0.96-3.86). In fact, when the subset of patients identified with hypertensive renal disease was considered independently, the risk due to family history of hypertension increased 14-fold which suggests a role as a confounder for hypertensive renal disease. The effect of chronic renal failure in a relative was independent of family history of diabetes.\r"

Over this range, fetal hemoglobin absorption is nearly identical to that of adult hemoglobin. Since currently available two-wavelength pulse oximeters base their calculations of arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation on absorption at the wavelengths of 660 and 920 nm, we conclude that the accuracy of two-wavelength pulse oximetry previously demonstrated in adults can be extrapolated to infants with high concentrations of fetal hemoglobin.\r"

Sinusoidal frequency analysis and the flush method of assessing the degree of distortion caused by the monitoring system were compared to determine whether these two methods agree in the estimation of natural frequency and damping coefficient. The frequency response of 30 radial artery catheter-manometer systems used for intensive-care unit patients was measured by the flush method and sinusoidal frequency analysis. The monitoring system consisted of a 20-gauge cannula, 150-cm pressure tubing, two plastic stopcocks, a continuous infusion device with fast flush valve, an American Edwards dome, a Hewlett-Packard quartz transducer, and a Hewlett-Packard blood pressure amplifier. Sinusoidal frequency analysis demonstrated second-order underdamped response for all 30 catheter-manometer systems. No secondary resonance peaks were observed up to a frequency of 200 Hz. The measured frequency response demonstrated that the average catheter-manometer system in use in our intensive care unit would cause significant distortion of the radial artery pressure, with the mean natural frequency (fn) of 14.7 +/- 3.7 Hz and the mean damping coefficient (zeta) of 0.24 +/- 0.07. Although the 30 monitoring systems had identical configurations and visible bubbles were carefully removed, a wide range of frequency responses was found (fn = 10.2 to 25.3; zeta = 0.15 to 0.44).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We evaluated the in vitro performance of this instrument by using a tonometry loop to simulate the clinical environment and to provide controlled gas tensions and pH in the circulating fluid. In this article we report the in vitro study in which 35 Gas-STAT blood gas sensors were used to assess the precision, stability, response time, and specificity of the instrument and to confirm the sterile integrity of its flow-through cells. The blood gas monitor exhibited precision values for pH, carbon dioxide tension (PCO2), and oxygen tension (PO2) of 0.1%, 1.3%, and 1.0%, respectively; stabilities were 0.002 units/h for pH, 0.5 mm Hg/h for PCO2, and 1.4 mm Hg/h for PO2; time constants (tau, a response to within 1/e of a new gas tension, approximately 63%) were 81 seconds for PCO2 and 72 seconds for PO2. No significant interference was detected in in vitro tests of 30 drugs and metabolites typically encountered during cardiac surgery. Bacterial challenge of the flow-through cell membranes showed that they provide an effective barrier isolating the sensors from contaminants in the fluid path. Our quality control consisted of measurement of a midrange gas standard as an unknown immediately following sensor calibration; this simple program is proposed as a complement to the manufacturer's operating procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Linear regression analysis of the pooled data demonstrated y = 0.98x - 0.01, r = 0.93, P less than 0.001, and n = 141 with heparin-impregnated catheters; and y = 0.87x + 8.0, r = 0.81, P less than 0.001, and n = 223 with plain catheters.

This study examined the performance of a forehead sensor compared with a finger sensor for the pulse oximeter and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. Ten healthy adult volunteers and 22 ventilator-dependent patients were studied. The arterial oxygen saturation detected by forehead pulse oximetry (SpO2) correlated well with finger SpO2 and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) determined by arterial blood gas analysis in the healthy volunteers. Forehead SpO2 in mechanically ventilated patients correlated well with finger SpO2 and SaO2 when heart rate detected by pulse oximeter differed less than 10% from apical heart rate. Factors that caused a difference in oximeter-detected heart rate and apical heart rate were extensive tissue edema, head movement, and difficulty securing good tape placement. This suggests that when signal strength is weak, causing poor pulse rate detection, there will also be problems associated with accurate SpO2. The forehead pulse oximeter sensor works well on healthy, well-oxygenated volunteers. Difficulty was experienced when applying and using the sensor on critically ill patients. The reliability of the forehead pulse oximeter sensor has not been established at low saturations.\r"

A standard definition of accuracy is needed for clinical practice and nutrition research. Any measure of accuracy should have two properties: 1) accuracy should improve as the number of observations increases and 2) the number of observations needed to achieve a given degree of accuracy should be unaffected by changes in the scale of measurement. Two approaches to defining accuracy are presented, one based on a proportion of the mean and the other using a proportion of the standard deviation (SD). The concept of reliability of measurement is introduced along with equations and tables that can be used in determining the number of repeated food records needed for a particular purpose. Defining accuracy in terms of the variability and reliability shows that increasing the number of days of a food record has a quickly diminishing return. For most purposes, 3-14 d of food diary records per subject will prove adequate.\r"

Analysis of variance of data revealed that there was a significant effect of the diet x substrate interaction. When results were expressed per cell lipid weight medium-chain fatty acids (capric and lauric) were esterified to a lesser extent than long-chain fatty acids regardless of the nature of dietary fat (saturated vs. unsaturated). The nature of dietary fat was found to have no effect on the incorporation of medium-chain fatty acids. Feeding saturated fats resulted in an increase of incorporation of long-chain fatty acids into adipose glycerides whereas feeding unsaturated fats did not modify fatty acid incorporation. Modifications of mean fat cell size by dietary fat could not account for all the observed variations.\r"

Compared to cholesterol-fed cellulose controls, all oat fibers altered the response to cholesterol feeding as indicated by 25-45% lower total lipoprotein cholesterol, 40-60% lower VLDL + LDL cholesterol, and 25-40% higher HDL cholesterol contents, P less than 0.01. The effect of the oat fibers on VLDL composition was especially pronounced as demonstrated by 30-65% lower VLDL protein, VLDL apo E and plasma apo B concentrations. The processed oat product which contained 40% more soluble fiber than oat bran or oat flour normalized the lipoprotein profile associated with ingestion of the atherogenic diet significantly more than oat bran or oat flour. Concentration of total lipoprotein cholesterol and distribution of apo E among the VLDL and LDL fractions in the processed oat product group were similar to controls not fed cholesterol. These data indicate that ingestion of oat fiber tends to normalize the lipoprotein profile induced by feeding an atherogenic diet in the rat, and that the hypocholesterolemic effect of oat fiber is associated with its soluble fiber content.\r"

If 4% safflower oil was added to the diet containing the myristoyl glycerol, hypothermia did not develop and the mortality decreased. There was a pronounced effect of ambient temperature on the toxic effects of rac-1(3)-myristoyl glycerol. Overall, the effects of feeding rac-1(3)-myristoyl glycerol paralleled the previous findings with rac-1(3)-palmitoyl glycerol. Thus there is a general toxicity associated with feeding the monoacylglycerol of any saturated fatty acid that can be reversed by including small amounts of safflower oil in the diet. The only change in plasma lipids that appears to be relevant to the toxicity and its reversal by safflower oil is an increase in cholesteryl linoleate and a corresponding decrease in the cholesteryl ester of the dietary monoacylglycerol. Even though mice ingested large amounts of rac-1(3)-myristoyl glycerol, the percentage of myristic acid in the plasma lipids was not higher than that found when a fat-free diet was fed, and was not affected by the level of myristoyl glycerol in the diet.\r"

In heart muscle all of the aminotransferase activity was accounted for by the mitochondrial fraction. Activity was found to be mitochondrial in skeletal muscle with high red fiber content and also in kidney cortex. Activity was predominantly cytosolic in brain and muscles with high white fiber composition. Thus, the distribution of branched-chain aminotransferase activity in skeletal muscle was dependent on fiber type. No branched-chain aminotransferase activity was detected in liver mitochondria, and in liver tissue activity was too low to be relevant at physiological concentrations of branched-chain amino acids. Within a tissue, regardless of the subcellular distribution of aminotransferase activity, the relative rates of transamination with subsaturating or \"saturating\" concentrations of KIV or isoleucine were similar. Finally, amino acid preference was also similar within a tissue, but not necessarily between or among different tissues.\r"

Male Wistar rats received diets containing 5.0% of a preparation of cereal fructans or 4.7 or 9.4% inulin. Each diet was tested with or without Nebacitin, an antibiotic drug given to suppress the intestinal microflora. The availability of fructans in the upper gastrointestinal tract was calculated from the recovery in feces in Nebacitin-treated rats. Animals receiving cereal fructans developed diarrhea, which made it impossible to measure the bioavailability of this substrate. With inulin, the extent of digestion and absorption appeared to be 18-26%. This might, at least to some degree, be explained by hydrolysis by gastric juice in the stomach. Thus, in an in vitro assay, mild acid hydrolysis (0.05 M HCl, 37 degrees C, 120 min) converted about 8% of inulin to free fructose. The apparent digestibility of the fructans was calculated from its recovery in feces from untreated rats. Only minute amounts of fructans could be detected, hence, cereal fructans as well as inulin reaching the hindgut appeared to be almost completely fermentable.\r"

Ten percent pectin was added to increase severity of B-12 deficiency. The addition of thiouracil to a diet containing 10% pectin decreased the excretion of methylmalonic acid suggesting an amelioration of the B-12 deficiency. It was found that part of this decreased methylmalonic acid excretion was due to a decreased food consumption with a correspondingly decreased intake of branched-chain amino acids which are precursors of methylmalonic acid. When attempts were made to increase the protein intake of animals receiving thiouracil so their amino acid intake was equal to that of the control animals, methylmalonic acid excretion was still lower than that of the controls. It was also found that the vitamin B-12 content of the liver was higher in the animals receiving thiouracil than in the controls. Thyroidectomy had the same effect as feeding thiouracil. Liver B-12 levels are rapidly depleted on a B-12 deficient diet containing 10% pectin. It appears that hypothyroidism, induced either by thyroidectomy or by feeding thiouracil, slows the rate of depletion of hepatic B-12 which in turn facilitates the metabolism of methylmalonic acid and decreases its excretion in the urine.\r"

Although hepatic and renal zinc concentrations of db/db mice fed the zinc-deficient diet tended to be lower than in any other experimental group when expressed on a dry weight basis, zinc concentrations in these tissues were either not different from or greater than those of their nondiabetic controls when expressed on an ash weight basis, i.e., relative to all mineral constituents of these organs. Hepatic and renal copper concentrations of the diabetic db/db mice were either not different from or greater than those of their controls on an ash weight basis. Femur zinc concentrations of diabetic db/db mice fed zinc-adequate diets were lower than those of their controls on a dry weight basis but were not different from their controls on an ash weight basis. We found proportionately lower dry zinc, calcium and magnesium concentrations in femurs of the db/db mice fed a nonpurified diet than in femurs of their db/m and m/m controls. These findings suggest that the low femur zinc concentration reported in the diabetic db/db mouse probably reflects a generalized decrease in bone mineral content rather than a specific depletion of tissue zinc stores.\r"

Rats were fed diets containing between 1.3 and 82.4 mg Mn/kg for 7 or 14 d and administered 54Mn by gavage or a test meal containing 5 or 20 micrograms Mn. Additional rats for each dietary treatment received 54Mn by intramuscular or intraperitoneal injection. Amount of Mn in the oral dose did not affect 54Mn absorption, but increasing dietary Mn reduced Mn absorption and enhanced 54Mn excretion. Absorption of 54Mn by fasted, gavaged rats was four times higher than in unfasted gavaged rats or in fasted rats fed test meals. Orally administered 54Mn had a shorter biological half-life than injected 54Mn and tissue distribution of 54Mn differed in rats given 54Mn by different routes. Rats fed between 1.4 and 2.8 mg Mn/kg diet grew as well as or better than those fed amounts similar to the recommended level (50 mg/kg). Sucrose-fed rats absorbed more than 54Mn than starch-fed rats. Rats fed sucrose excreted injected 54Mn faster than rats fed starch. Concentrations of liver Mn in sucrose-fed rats were higher than in starch-fed rats. Our results indicate that both absorption and excretion are important in maintaining Mn homeostasis in rats.\r"

Seven women were fed a basal diet containing 1.25 mg Cu/d. At 4-wk intervals, they were fed test meals over a 3-d period; each set of meals contained one of the labeled test foods in amounts with similar copper content. Absorption of 65Cu from intrinsically labeled liver was (mean +/- SD) 65 +/- 4%; extrinsic liver, 65 +/- 10%; E/I = 1.00 +/- 0.16. 65Cu absorption from intrinsically labeled goose breast meat was 54 +/- 6%; extrinsic meat, 52 +/- 10%; E/I = 0.97 +/- 0.18. 65Cu absorption from intrinsically labeled peanut butter was 58 +/- 15%; extrinsic peanut butter, 54 +/- 10%; E/I = 0.93 +/- 0.11. 65Cu absorption from extrinsically labeled sunflower butter was 50 +/- 2%. There were no differences in absorption of intrinsic and extrinsic Cu from these foods. Absorption of Cu was significantly higher from goose liver than from goose meat or sunflower butter (P less than 0.05). With a dietary intake of 1.25 +/- 0.20 mg Cu/d, Cu balance, exclusive of surface losses, was essentially zero (0.01 +/- 0.13 mg/d) in the seven subjects.\r"

While T3 alone had no effect on calcium uptake by gut segments cultured on d 20 of embryonic development, the thyroid hormone amplified the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on calcium transport and effectively shifted the dose-response curve to lower 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentrations. T3 had a dual effect on Pi uptake by cultured jejunum: It induced transport activity even in the absence of the steroid hormone, and, in addition, synergistically raised 1,25-(OH)2D3-related Pi uptake. In d 17 embryonic small intestine, which does not respond to 1,25-(OH)2D3 by a significant increase in Pi transport, T3 permitted the induction of Pi transport by the sterol. In general, the thyroid hormone enhanced the responsiveness of cultured embryonic intestine toward 1,25-(OH)2D3 by two orders of magnitude, resulting in facilitated induction of calcium and Pi transport by the sterol and, in particular, modulated the stage-specific expression of 1,25-(OH)2D3 action on intestinal Pi transport.\r"

Each litter was separated from the mother following the first colostrum feeding and divided into 2 groups, one of which was fed a purified rabbit formula that was essentially free of carnitine; the other received the same formula supplemented with L-carnitine (100 mg/l). At 9-13 d of age, rabbit pups receiving the carnitine-free formula had lower concentrations of total, free and acylcarnitine in plasma and urine, as well as lower total acid soluble carnitine concentrations in liver, muscle, heart and brown adipose tissue than those receiving the same formula supplemented with L-carnitine. Their plasma and tissue levels were also lower, but their urinary carnitine concentrations were higher than those in naturally-raised pups. The findings suggest that the described animal model may prove to be a useful tool for the investigation of certain aspects of neonatal carnitine deficiency.\r"

Forty-two rats (320 g) were given ad libitum access to feed or fasted for 72 h after which time visceral organ mass and metabolic activity were measured. Liver metabolic activity was measured in vitro by [14C]valine incorporation into acid-precipitable protein and oxygen consumption in isolated hepatocytes. Fasted rats had lower weights of liver and intestines and similar kidney and stomach weights relative to body weight than fed rats. Compared with fed controls, fasted rats had lower RNA and higher DNA concentrations in liver and intestines with decreased RNA and protein mass in all visceral organs. Nutrient deprivation generally resulted in reduced ratios of RNA/DNA and protein/DNA in visceral tissues. Nutrient deprivation had no effect on in vitro oxygen consumption or [14C]valine incorporation expressed per g tissue. However, in vitro oxygen consumption and valine incorporation expressed per unit DNA and estimated total liver oxygen consumption were reduced in fasted rats. These data suggest that nutrient deprivation reduced visceral organ mass of RNA and protein primarily through an apparent reduction in cell size. Nutrient deprivation resulted in decreased liver oxygen consumption because of decreased organ size rather than by tissue metabolic activity.\r"

Dams were fed 6, 12 or 250 mg Fe/kg diet during gestation and lactation. Approximately one-half of the 17-d-old pups were injected intraperitoneally with 10(5) plaque-forming units of vaccinia virus. Four d later, nonimmune and vaccinia-immune pups were killed. Spleen lymphocyte suspensions were prepared and plated with or without rat alpha/beta interferon for 2 h at 37 degrees C. Washed lymphocytes were combined with 51chromium-labeled YAC-1 target cells and co-cultured for 4 and 16 h at 10 and 50:1 effector-to-target ratios. Hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, body weight, spleen weight and lymphocyte numbers per spleen were lower in iron-deficient pups than in controls. In general, interferon stimulation increased natural killer cell activity above baseline. Analysis of variance comparison among groups showed that interferon was incapable of restoring natural killer cell activity of iron-deficient pups to the levels observed in control pups. Impaired spleen natural killer cell activity in iron-deficient neonates may be due to a limited capacity for stimulation by interferon.\r"

In replicate experiments, 30 mixed-breed ram lambs were individually fed diets supplemented with approximately 0.05% ruminally protected limestone (control), alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC), isovalerate (IVA) or leucine (Leu). Serum titers of antibodies produced in response to Brucella abortus antigen and porcine red blood cells were determined. Mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte blastogenesis was determined in experiment 2 by adding phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM) to isolated lymphocytes and measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. In both experiments, in lambs fed Leu, antibody production to porcine red blood cells was approximately 80% (P less than 0.05) of that in control animals. When KIC was fed, antibody titers to porcine red blood cells were approximately 120% (P less than 0.05) of that of controls. Compared to controls background lymphocyte blastogenesis was higher when KIC was fed, whereas background blastogenesis was lower when Leu was fed (KIC vs. Leu; P less than 0.05). IVA did not significantly affect either measurement. These data indicate that feeding Leu may adversely affect immune function by suppressing lymphocyte activity, whereas oral administration of KIC has a positive influence on immune function in sheep by increasing lymphocyte activity.\r"

  ".W": "The serum albumin concentration is used clinically as an indicator of nutritional status and as a prognostic indicator. Critically ill patients, who display many aspects of the acute phase response, frequently have low serum albumin levels upon hospitalization. Cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), mediate many aspects of the acute phase response. One purpose of this study was to determine if TNF administration to healthy well-nourished rabbits could produce hypoalbuminemia. After intravenous administration of saline or TNF, the TNF-treated rabbits experienced significant hypoalbuminemia which was most prominent at 24 h and was partially corrected by 48 h. A second purpose was to evaluate the effects of TNF treatment on transendothelial movement of albumin using an in vitro porcine pulmonary artery-endothelial cell system. Exposure to TNF for 24 h resulted in a dose dependent increase in transendothelial passage of albumin. These data suggest that the mechanisms of hypoalbuminemia frequently observed in critically ill patients can be explained in part by cytokine (TNF)-induced endothelial cell injury, which results in enhanced endothelial permeability to albumin. The hypoalbuminemia observed in many critically ill patients thus may be unrelated to nutritional status, but rather may be related to the patient's underlying disease state.\r"

This study was designed to help identify AS use patterns among the male portion of the general adolescent population. The overall participation rate on a schoolwide basis was 68.7% and on an individual basis reached 50.3%. Participants in this investigation were 12th-grade male students (N = 3403) in 46 private and public high schools across the nation who completed a questionnaire that established current or previous use of AS as well as user and nonuser characteristics. Results indicate that 6.6% of 12th grade male students use or have used AS and that over two thirds of the user group initiated use when they were 16 years of age or younger. Approximately 21% of users reported that a health professional was their primary source. The evidence indicates that educational intervention strategies should begin as early as junior high school; the intervention should not be directed only toward those individuals who participate in school-based athletics.\r"

Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scores were utilized to compare severity of illness and were similar for each group (29 +/- 11 before CCM vs 28 +/- 10 after CCM). However, mortality was significantly lower during the post-CCM interval (74% vs 57%, respectively). There was no significant difference in the frequency of use of mechanical ventilation (83% vs 87%), although pulmonary artery catheters (48% vs 64%) and arterial catheters (24% vs 73%) were employed more frequently after CCM. The number of subspecialty consultations and MICU and hospital length of stay were similar for both intervals. We conclude that the implementation of dedicated staffing by CCM physicians in a university hospital MICU was associated with a favorable impact on patients with septic shock.\r"

We collected incidence and prevalence data on ISH and evaluated several potential factors for its occurrence in the Framingham Heart Study during 16 biennial examinations. The factors evaluated were age, sex, all components of the blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure), Metropolitan relative weight, serum cholesterol level, serum uric acid level, cigarette smoking, ventricular heart rate, glucose intolerance, and hematocrit. The population at risk (1687 men and 1992 women) were those members of the Framingham cohort with a systolic blood pressure less than 160 mm Hg in the first four biennial examinations. Results showed ISH in 14.4% of the men and 22.8% of the women. Cumulative incidence rates were 418 per 1000 in men and 533 per 1000 in women. Significant risk factors for ISH were age, sex, all components of the blood pressure, and increased relative weight in women. We conclude that ISH is a highly prevalent disorder. Its major determinants are age, sex, increasing levels of blood pressure, and obesity in women.\r"

Among nondiabetic patients, the risk of fatal coronary heart disease was significantly lower in women compared with men (relative risk, 0.6). In the presence of diabetes, however, the risk of recurrent MI in women was twice the risk in men. In addition, the effect of diabetes doubled the risk of recurrent MI in women (relative risk, 2.1) but had an insignificant effect in men. Increased susceptibility to cardiac failure among diabetic women was an important factor in determining survivorship. Women with diabetes developed cardiac failure four times more often (16%) than women without diabetes (3.8%). Furthermore, when cardiac failure developed, 25% of diabetic women experienced a recurrent MI or fatal coronary event, more than doubling the rate when diabetes was absent. We conclude that in the diabetic patient who survives an MI, cardiac failure is a common occurrence, warranting early detection and vigorous management in periods of convalescence and follow-up. In addition, when cardiac failure appears, control of diabetes assumes added importance, particularly in women, where its effect on survivorship is considerable.\r"

We employed four meals: a bland meal of unpeppered steak and french fries (negative control), a bland meal with 1950 mg of aspirin (positive control), a spicy Mexican meal (30 g of jalapeno peppers), and a pepperoni pizza. Twelve subjects (eight men and four women, aged 24 to 43 years) were studied in a randomized, crossover trial with the test meal given at the noon and evening meals; each subject received all four test meals. Each study consisted of a baseline endoscopy, which was repeated approximately 12 hours after the last test meal. Gastric and duodenal damage was scored using a modification of the Lanza scale. Eleven of 12 individuals taking the bland meal plus aspirin developed multiple gastric erosions (median score, C; which equates with \"severe\" injury). In contrast, the median endoscopic score for the other three meals was 0. Single cases of a single erosion were present after the Mexican meals and after the pizza meals. Another experiment was done to examine the effect of spices directly on the gastric mucosa; approximately 30 g of fresh jalapeno peppers was ground in a food processor and then placed directly into the stomach. Endoscopy after 24 hours revealed no visible mucosal damage. The ingestion of highly spiced meals by normal individuals is not associated with endoscopically demonstrable gastroduodenal mucosal damage.\r"

FR reduced the renal mass by 41%, but the capacity for handling of labelled endocytosed proteins by the lysosomes was not different from fed PHN rats. While PHN with heavy proteinuria increased the recovery of lysosomal enzymes in the large lysosomes located in the proximal tubule, no changes were observed in FR-PHN rats in spite of significant proteinuria. The density of the small lysosomes was significantly shifted/reduced (from 1,200 and 1,235 g/ml to 1,185 and 1,225 g/ml, respectively) in both fed and FR-PHN rats, suggesting that the handling of extra loads of protein may enhance the absorptive function of small lysosomes found in the lower part of the nephron. FR reduced the mechanical fragility of lysosomes in the kidney cortex of PHN-rats. The highly increased urinary excretion of lysosomal enzymes in fed PHN rats was not observed in FR-PHN rats. As a conclusion, FR reduces both the fragility of lysosomes and the proportion of digestive enzymes in fragile lysosomes. These lysosomal enzymes may be of pathogenic importance in PHN causing cell damage when liberated from disrupted lysosomes.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with impaired long chain fatty acids (LCFA) oxidation by skeletal muscle mitochondria. This is due to reduced activity of carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT). These derangements were attributed to the secondary hyperparathyroidism of CRF, since prior parathyroidectomy in CRF rats reversed these abnormalities and PTH administration to normal rats reproduced them. It was proposed that these effects of PTH are mediated by its ionophoric property leading to increased entry of calcium into skeletal muscle. A calcium channel blocker may, therefore, correct these derangements. The present study examined the effects of verapamil on LCFA oxidation, CPT activity by skeletal muscle mitochondria, and 45Ca uptake by skeletal muscle obtained from CRF rats and normal animals treated with PTH with and without verapamil. Both four days of PTH administration and 21 days of CRF produced significant (P less than 0.01) reduction in LCFA oxidation and CPT activity of skeletal muscle mitochondria, and significant (P less than 0.01) increment in 45Ca uptake by skeletal muscle. Simultaneous treatment with verapamil corrected all these derangements. Administration of verapamil alone to normal rats did not cause a significant change in any of these parameters. The data are consistent with the proposition that the alterations in LCFA in CRF or after PTH treatment are related to the ionophoric action of the hormone and could be reversed by a calcium channel blocker.\r"

Infusion of platelet activating factor (s-PAF) into the isolated perfused kidney caused a dose-dependent fall in renal vascular resistance (RVR): 12 +/- 6% at 10 nM s-PAF, 18 +/- 3% at 100 nM s-PAF and 20 +/- 7% at 1 microM s-PAF. Glomerular filtration rate fell by 32 +/- 5% at 10 nM, 38 +/- 6% at 100 nM, and 52 +/- 10% at 1 microM. s-PAF (50 nM) increased urinary protein excretion after 20 minutes. Because GFR fell to a greater extent than RVR, possible changes in glomerular permeability after s-PAF treatment were assessed morphologically using native ferritin. After s-PAF treatment (100 nM), the number of ferritin particles/micron2 increased from 1.2 +/- 0.9 (control) to 795 +/- 69 in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and from 0.2 +/- 0.06 (control) to 98 +/- 29 in lamina rara externa (LRE). To quantitate changes in fixed anionic charges, polyethylenimine (PEI) was quantitated morphologically in GBM. No significant change between s-PAF treated and untreated kidneys was seen. s-PAF did not alter the sialoglycoprotein pattern in the perfused kidney as assessed by lysozyme staining. These results are in contrast to findings with s-PAF in vivo where in addition to increased glomerular permeability, a reduction of fixed anionic charges is seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Kidneys were perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit-albumin medium for 60 minutes at pH 7.4 or pH 7.0. At the lower pH, GFR was reduced by 25%, TRNa by 32% and oxygen consumption by 41% as compared to perfusion at pH 7.4 (all P less than 0.05). In addition, the usual hypoxic injury observed in the medullary thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle (TAL) in the IPK at pH 7.4 (consisting of nuclear pyknosis and focal fragmentation necrosis) was reduced by acidosis from 62% to 14% of tubules involved (P less than 0.005). This cytoprotection was not the result of improved oxygenation since O2 delivery was actually slighty reduced at pH 7.0 compared to pH 7.4. Furthermore, acidosis was protective even after perfusion with non-oxygenated media (42% tubules damaged at pH 7.0 vs. 95% of tubules damaged at pH 7.4; P less than 0.01), making it very unlikely that the effect of acidosis is to improve TAL oxygenation. Since previous studies indicate that the TAL lesion is transport dependent and prevented in the non-filtering kidney, it was possible that the decrease in GFR associated with acidosis could account for decreased injury. The GFR was manipulated by alterations in perfusion pressure or albumin concentration, and no consistent relationship between the extent of injury and GFR could be shown at either pH over a wide range of GFR values. Therefore, acidosis protected the TAL from hypoxic injury by a mechanism apparently independent of oxygen or solute delivery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The latter is associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism and PTH has been shown to affect myocardial metabolism. The present study evaluated in rats the effects of four days administration of PTH and 21 days of chronic renal failure (CRF) with and without excess PTH on oxidation of alpha-ketoglutarate, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, LCFA and short chain fatty acids (SCFA). PTH impaired oxidation of alpha-ketoglutarate, LCFA, SCFA, but not of beta-hydroxybutyric acid and reduced the activity of carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT). Inactivation of the PTH abolished its effects. CRF rats with intact parathyroid glands also had impaired oxidation of LCFA and CTP activity. Carnitine contents of myocardium were not altered. The data show that PTH excess in normal rats is associated with impaired oxidation of LCFA and SCFA, and secondary hyperparathyroidism in CRF animals impairs oxidation of LCFA. This effect is due to: 1) reduction in the activity of CPT, a key enzyme for the transport of LCFA to mitochondrial matrix for beta-oxidation; and 2) impairment in beta-oxidation. The data provide for new and additional pathway through which excess PTH and CRF can affect myocardial metabolism.\r"

To establish normal limits of this functional reserve is of clinical relevance because its loss may be the earliest indication of renal damage. For this purpose we have used a method applicable in clinical practice: one-hour clearances of creatinine (CCr) done under water diuresis, before (unstimulated) and two hours after (stimulated) a test meat meal, taking a single postmeal blood sample. Urine collection was done by voluntary voiding under direct supervision. In studies done in 14 control subjects, inulin clearance (CIn)/CCr ratios were (mean +/- SEM) 1.04 +/- 0.05 and 0.96 +/- 0.03, in unstimulated and stimulated clearances, respectively. In studies repeated at three to nine week intervals, we found a variation coefficient (mean +/- SEM) of 24.5 +/- 3.11% and 9.25 +/- 1.43% (P less than 0.001) for the unstimulated and stimulated CCr, respectively. The corresponding values for CIn were 19.3 +/- 2.36% and 9.17 +/- 1.19% (P less than 0.001), suggesting that stimulated GFR values are more stable. Unstimulated and stimulated GFR and renal functional reserve (stimulated CCr - unstimulated CCr) were studied in 260 school aged children, ages 6 to 16 years (140 boys and 120 girls). The distribution of the renal functional reserve was approximately Gaussian but the distribution of the urinary creatinine excretion, unstimulated and stimulated GFR had considerable positive skewness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The curve of serial values of net rebound correlated (r = 0.70) with the theoretical curve predicted by the two pool urea kinetics model (UKM). A mean equilibrium concentration (Ce) was achieved in 48 minutes, with a 7.58% increase in Co. Stabilized rebound (Re) was compared after four different HD procedures, and significant correlations were found between the magnitude of Re and the indexes of HD efficiency, dialyzer clearance (r = 0.75) and Kt/V (r = 0.68). The highest values of Re (8.6% and 8.8%) were observed after the procedures with largest urea removal, irrespective of the biocompatibility conditions (new or reused dialyzers). The single pool UKM applied with the stabilized end-HD urea concentration Ce instead of Co resulted in more physiological values of urea distribution volume (56.1% vs. 50.5% of body wt) and in lower values of Kt/V (0.64 vs. 0.73, P less than 0.001) and protein catabolic rate (1.07 vs. 1.17 g/kg/day, P less than 0.001). A reequilibration process, rather than protein hypercatabolism, seems to be responsible for most rebound, the magnitude of which correlated with the efficiency of the procedure. Only by considering Ce as the true end-HD urea concentration it is possible to minimize the errors arising from the application of a single pool analysis to a two pool system.\r"

We sought to determine whether the discrepancy between CCr and CIn remains constant over time (months, years) in each individual patient, and therefore whether serial measurements of CCr reliably reflect the direction and magnitude of change in CIn. Twenty-five patients with LN underwent simultaneous determinations of CCr and CIn performed two to four (mean 3.3) times over three years. In a given patient, it was found that the ratio of CCr/CIn changed substantially over time (mean SD 0.16 with 95% confidence interval of 0.12 to 0.20). Thus, in about 32% of cases the ratio of CCr/CIn will vary more than +/- 16% from a previously measured value of CCr/CIn. Patients with both high and low values of CIn showed similar variability in CCR/CIn over time. Variability in CCr/CIn was found regardless of whether CIn was increasing, decreasing, or constant over time. In nearly one-half of all measurements of CCr, the corresponding change in CIn was directionally discordant. Iothalamate and technetium-DTPA renal clearances correlated highly with CIn (R2 = 0.99). We conclude that the discrepancy between CCr and CIn can vary greatly over time in an individual patient. Consequently, serial CCr does not accurately measure the direction or magnitude of change in glomerular filtration rate in lupus nephropathy.\r"

This may be due to inadequate serum concentrations of 1.25(OH)2 vitamin D and/or to insufficient dietary calcium supplementation. In the present study, therefore, we examined the effect on parathyroid function of calcitriol and calcium carbonate, administered orally, in doses sufficient to normalize the serum 1.25(OH)2 vitamin D and calcium concentrations. After nine months of combined therapy, marked suppression of immunoreactive PTH occurred in the absence of hypercalcemia. Furthermore, prolonged therapy resulted in additional suppression of the PTH concentrations comparable in magnitude to that reported following intravenous calcitriol therapy and was associated with a mild degree of hypercalcemia similar to that which occurs with intravenous therapy. Euparathyroidism was achieved in 25% of the patients by 15 months of treatment. In conclusion, secondary hyperparathyroidism can be effectively controlled with combined oral therapy without significant hypercalcemia in selected patients with end-stage renal failure. This salutary effect may result from direct actions of 1.25(OH)2D on the parathyroid gland and/or gastrointestinal tract, or from an overall action of combined treatment to restore calcium homeostasis.\r"

The studies so far available indicate that repeated estrogen administrations are necessary to short bleeding time in uremia in a dose range of 95 to 325 mg. With the present study we wanted to establish whether single or repeated doses are required to induce a significant shortening of bleeding time in uremia, and the minimum cumulative dose of conjugated estrogens necessary to control bleeding time for a prolonged period of time, and to check whether the prolonged effect of estrogens on bleeding time in uremia is due to an accumulation of the drug or its metabolites in the blood. Fifteen uremics on chronic hemodialysis were studied. A pilot study carried out in five uremic patients indicated that single or repeated estrogen infusions of 0.3 mg/kg did not significantly influence bleeding time values. Therefore the subsequent studies have been carried out using daily infusion of 0.6 mg/kg. A single estrogen infusion of 0.6 mg/kg shortened bleeding time in all patients. The effect was transient and bleeding time returned to pre-infusion values within 72 hours. A 50% decrease of bleeding time or a shortening of bleeding time more than 30 to 15 minutes or less was obtained in all patients with four or five infusions (0.6 mg/kg) spaced 24 hours apart. The effect lasted for 14 days. At day 25 from the last infusion all the patients had bleeding time values comparable with the pre-infusion ones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Treatments were comprised of: (1) mild protein restriction; (2) more severe protein and phosphorus restriction plus essential amino acids; or (3) the same diet plus ketoacids. Progression was significantly (P less than 0.025) correlated with urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion in all three treatment groups; overall r was 0.78 (P less than 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis showed that the following factors were not additional significant determinants of progression: urea N excretion, phosphate excretion, protein excretion, serum calcium times phosphorus product, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum uric acid, serum triglycerides, serum cholesterol, etiology, mean arterial pressure, or enalapril treatment. However, when urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion was factored by GFR (with which it was correlated), additional significant regressors appeared: serum triglycerides and polycystic kidney disease, which tended to be associated with more rapid progression, and ketoacid treatment, which tended to be associated with slower progression. Mean 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion differed significantly between the three treatment groups, in the order (1) greater than (2) greater than (3) (though not when factored by GFR). Changing from essential amino acids to ketoacids (or vice versa) without change in diet was associated with lower 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion on ketoacids (but not when factored by GFR).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Selection of a laser source for intravascular applications has frequently been predicated upon assumptions involving transmissibility in blood of the wavelength of light emitted by a given laser. Standard absorption curves for ultraviolet radiation in blood and infrared radiation in water would suggest that transmission of ultraviolet radiation through a blood field and infrared radiation through any aqueous fluid field would be insufficient for tissue ablation. The present series of experiments was undertaken to determine whether these theoretical predictions would in fact obviate the use of these wavelengths in a blood field. Specimens of normal human myocardium and/or polyvinylchloride were submerged under blood and water and irradiated with ultraviolet radiation (351 nm) delivered as a focused beam and via an optical fiber and infrared radiation (10,600 nm) delivered as a focused beam. Ablation of myocardium was successfully accomplished with a focused beam of both ultraviolet and infrared radiation under as much as 5 mm of blood and with ultraviolet radiation via an optical fiber with the fiber tip up to 3 mm distant from the tissue specimen. High-speed cine recordings of ablation carried out using a focused beam of laser radiation demonstrated that formation of a dynamic optical cavity is the basis for successful pulsed ultraviolet and infrared laser transanguineous tissue ablation. These results thus demonstrate that prediction of wavelength transmission through fluid media based on optical properties of a static fluid does not predict ability to accomplish ablation under dynamic circumstances of laser irradiation.\r"

However, little is known about the effects of blood and flow on the temperature of the laser probe or the arterial wall during lasing. To study this, probe and arterial wall temperatures were measured while a metal capped fiber, activated by an argon laser, was held stationary in a stenotic human peripheral artery. Arteries were perfused with saline and blood, and flow was varied from 0 to 140 cc/min. Probe temperatures were significantly higher in blood than in saline. However, the increased probe temperature achieved in blood was not transferred to the arterial wall. Increasing flow decreased probe temperature in both media, but again arterial wall temperatures were minimally affected. Thus, the presence of blood and flow may significantly affect heat generation and heat transfer during arterial recanalization using metal capped fibers.\r"

  ".W": "The 577-nm flashlamp-pumped tunable dye laser pulsed at 450 microseconds is rapidly becoming the treatment of choice for removal of portwine stains and other vascular ectasias. In this study, we examined the mechanisms of vessel destruction by determining the effects of laser irradiation on three types of primary target cells--erythrocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Human endothelial cells and fibroblasts in microwell plates were irradiated at various energy densities with the laser, after which several aspects of cellular biology were determined, including 1) viability of cells by trypan blue exclusion test; 2) cell proliferation by [3H]thymidine incorporation; and 3) rate of protein synthesis using [3H]leucine incorporation as a marker. In endothelial cell cultures, both [3H]thymidine and [3H]leucine incorporations were inhibited at energy levels of 5-12 J/cm2 (P less than 0.01). In fibroblast cultures, cell proliferation was similarly inhibited, while supratherapeutic energy density (greater than or equal to 12 J/cm2) was required for inhibition of protein synthesis. The laser energy in the range of 5-8.5 J/cm2 had no effect on cell viability. Erythrocytes as target cells for laser energy demonstrated rapid, dose-dependent lysis, as determined by release of free hemoglobin into culture medium. Addition of erythrocytes into a coculture with endothelial cells abolished the direct inhibitory effect noted in cultures when endothelial cells were present alone. The results of the latter experiment imply that erythrocytes are the primary target cell absorbing the laser energy at 577 nm. However, direct laser effects on endothelial cells may also contribute to the mechanisms of ablation of the vascular ectasias by the tunable dye laser at 577 nm.\r"

Ten additional Wistar rats served as controls in which conventional interrupted one-layer anastomosis was performed. The results show a significant superiority of the intestinal anastomoses that were constructed by means of laser tissue welding. The time to complete the anastomosis was also significantly shorter when laser rather than manual suturing was used. Serial histological examinations for up to 90 days following surgery revealed complete healing and epithelization of the anastomotic site.\r"

This study compared the thermodynamics during CO2 and argon laser welding of 1-cm longitudinal arteriotomies in a canine model. Continuous recordings using an AGA 782 digital thermographic system with spatial and thermal resolution of +/-0.2 mm and +/-0.2 degree C, respectively, were analyzed. A HGM argon laser using a 300-microns optic fiber held at 1 cm from the vessel edges (spot diameter = 2.8 mm) with concomitant room temperature saline irrigation (1 drop/sec) was used for argon welds. Total exposure time was 150 sec/cm. CO2 welds were performed with a Sharplan CO2 laser (spot diameter = 0.22 mm) with no irrigation for total exposure time of 10 sec/cm. Thermodynamic results and laser parameters are summarized as follows: Argon-n = 20; power = 500 mW; energy fluence = 1,400 J/cm2; Tmax = 48.8 degrees C; T mean +/- S.D. = 45.1 +/- 2.7 degrees C; CO2-n = 20; power = 150 mW; energy fluence = 3,000 J/cm2; Tmax 84.0 degrees C; T mean +/- S.D. = 60.7 +/- 9.8 degrees C. There was a significant difference (P less than .05) in thermal measurements between successful CO2 and argon vascular welds. Temperature rise during the argon welds was limited by saline irrigation. In contrast, during CO2 laser welding, the temperature rose quickly to its maximum and was maintained at a relatively high level as the laser progressed (0.1 cm/sec) along the anastomosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we used the neodymium:YAG laser with the MTR 1.5 contact probe to denude the entire mucosa of the canine urinary bladder. Evaluation of our results showed that mucosal denudation by this technique can be performed simply and safely without complications. Specifically, we encountered no significant bladder hemorrhage, urinary extravasation, bladder contracture, ureteral reflux, or hydronephrosis. We believe that the denudation procedure may be useful as a surgical means of treating the entire bladder mucosa in patients with proliferative epithelial lesions of the bladder including multifocal carcinoma in situ.\r"

Both CO2 laser scars were less mature, the ChW scar measured 1.04 mm, the RSP scar measured 1.37 mm, and both contained cellular granulation tissue without visible collagen fibers. The breaking strength of the scars was measured with a tensiometer. Laser wounds were weaker than the knife wound.

These qualities are used to advantage in the treatment of strictures. The argon laser was used to perform 13 internal urethrotomies and ten vesical neck incisions. The operative method used is similar to optical internal urethrotomy. The argon probe incises hemostatically, reducing the need for extensive fulguration of tissues at the operative site and thereby reducing the tendency for more scar tissue to form and compromise the operation. The same hemostasis reduces the need for postoperative indwelling urethral catheterization. Utility of the argon device in most instances allows treatment to be conducted on an outpatient basis without general anesthesia and without use of postoperative urethral catheters, yielding an effective, cost-saving therapy.\r"

Clinically, dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease; when compared with the usual Graves' orbitopathy patient, the optic neuropathy group presented at a later age and with a later onset of thyroid eye disease. The patients in this group were more likely to be male and/or diabetic, and often presented with desaturation of color vision. Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group. The most sensitive indicators of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visual-evoked potentials and color vision. Computed tomographic studies confirmed that apical orbital crowding was a characteristic feature of optic neuropathy. These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients.\r"

A total of 1044 treatments were given over a 4-year period. A reduction in orbicularis spasm intensity was noted in 1012 (96.9%) treatments (mean duration, 13.3 weeks). There was no clear relationship between toxin dose and the amount of spasm reduction or duration of response, and average duration of beneficial effect remained constant from the first through the twelfth injections. Complications occurred in 236 (22.6%) treatments. In most cases, these were local and transient. Symptomatic dry eye was the most common side effect, noted in 7.5% of cases. Ptosis was reported in 7.3% of treatments and photophobia in 2.5%. Diplopia involving the inferior oblique or lateral rectus muscles was seen in less than 1% of cases. There were no differences in degree of response or in complications among the three diagnostic groups, although there was a slight difference in duration of effect. Patients who had undergone previous eyelid surgery for blepharospasm did not respond differently from those without prior surgery.\r"

Twenty-two adults, 11 with unilateral and 11 with bilateral unrecovered sixth nerve palsy, were treated with injections of botulinum toxin to the contracted medial rectus followed by transposition surgery to the vertical rectus muscles. This management technique produced a satisfactory reduction in esotropia, averaging 46 prism diopters (PD), comparable with that achieved by conventional surgery in other series. The advantages of this form of treatment are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "An unusual eyelid tumor with sebaceous differentiation developed in two 70-year-old men and each had an earlier history of one or more colonic carcinomas--the so-called Muir-Torre syndrome. These eyelid tumors were both behaviorally and histopathologically different from previously documented cutaneous neoplasms in this syndrome. In the first case, a sebaceous adenoma took multifocal origin from the epidermis and exhibited an interanastomosing retiform growth pattern in the underlying dermis; the lesion rapidly recurred as a keratoacanthoma after subtotal excision. In the second case, a conjunctival tumor with features of a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma manifested focal evidence of sebaceous differentiation. Again, after an incisional biopsy, the latter tumor rapidly regrew and transformed into a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with massive central necrosis. Although sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelids does not appear to presage the Muir-Torre syndrome, any benign sebaceous or transitional squamo-sebaceous neoplasm should be considered a possible manifestation of this syndrome. Both clear-cut benign and transitional sebaceous neoplasms should also be recognized as having the potential to undergo an ominous clinical regrowth upon subtotal excision and a complete squamous transformation.\r"

Highly malignant histopathologic features developed, and the eye finally perforated and had to be enucleated. No recurrence or metastases have subsequently developed. Histologically, the tumor was a nonteratoid medulloepithelioma consisting of elements resembling embryonic retina, nonpigmented ciliary epithelium, and neuroblasts, but had also areas of obvious glial and neuronal differentiation as judged by immunohistochemistry. The neuroepithelial tumor cells were positive for neuron-specific enolase, vimentin, and often for S-100 protein. The neuroblastic cells were generally positive for neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin, but were intermixed with glia-like tumor cells positive for vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and S-100 protein. The results suggest that even a nonteratoid medulloepithelioma may be, unlike retinoblastoma, a truly multipotential tumor.\r"

The 30-year cumulative incidence was 35.1% for the 137 patients who received radiation therapy compared with an incidence rate of 5.8% for the 78 patients who did not receive radiation. In the 137 patients who received radiation, second tumors developed both inside and outside the field of therapy. There was a 30-year incidence rate of second tumors of 29.3% within the field of irradiation and 8.1% outside the field. The rate outside the field of irradiation (8.1%) was similar to that observed in nonirradiated patients (5.8%). Our findings indicate that carriers of the retinoblastoma gene have an increased incidence of second tumors, and that the incidence rate is further increased in patients who receive radiation therapy.\r"

The visual field indices, mean defect and loss standard deviation, were calculated from Octopus Program 32. There were statistically significant linear correlations between each of the optic nerve structural parameters and visual field mean defect and loss standard deviation. The strongest correlation was between disc rim area and visual field mean defect (r = -0.49), which are both global measures of glaucomatous damage. The correlations were not strong enough to readily allow the recognition of early nerve damage by the parameters analyzed thus far. Closer correlations may be evident if structural parameters can be found that more accurately reflect the number of surviving axons in the optic nerve head.\r"

A patent fistula was achieved intraoperatively in all seven eyes. Postoperatively, six patients received subconjunctival injection of 5-fluorouracil (5-FI) once daily for an average of 8 days. Five of seven patients have retained a functional bleb and a controlled intraocular pressure (IOP) after surgery (follow-up, 4-24 months). The only intraoperative complication was hemorrhage from the sclerectomy site in a patient with aniridia that resulted in a 20% hyphema. The hyphema cleared quickly, and the bleb has remained functional with a pressure of 12 mmHg for 9 months. The trabecuphine makes it possible to perform a glaucoma filtering operation safely from within the anterior chamber. This technique minimizes conjunctival trauma in the filtration area. The absence of a conjunctival incision overlying the fistula simplifies the adjunctive use of antimetabolites such as 5-FU.\r"

This gonioscopic procedure results in immediate visualization of angle structures and prompt reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP). Routine tonometry and appropriate gonioscopy are essential to diagnose this form of glaucoma, which does not have a pupillary block component. Timely use of laser iris retraction reduces the risk of chronic glaucoma secondary to synechial closure. In this series, only two of ten patients, not previously known to have glaucoma, require long-term medication to control IOP.\r"

The current study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) as a definitive treatment for phacolytic glaucoma. Five cases of phacolytic glaucoma that occurred between 1984 and 1986 were studied after a retrospective chart review; ECCE (with placement of a posterior chamber intraocular lens [PC IOL]) was performed without complication and was curative in all five eyes. All patients (100%) maintained intraocular pressures (IOPs) of less than 20 mmHg, without medical therapy. The best-corrected visual acuity for all cases was 20/50 or better (80%, greater than or equal to 20/40) with 5 months to 3 years follow-up. These results suggest that ECCE is an effective alternative for the treatment of phacolytic glaucoma and allows surgeons the freedom to choose the procedure with which they are most comfortable. Additionally, implantation of a PC IOL is a safe and efficacious procedure in restoring visual function in these patients.\r"

There was no apparent effect of patient experience on the mean sensitivity, total loss, or the number of disturbed test locations. There was a significant (P less than 0.0001) decrease in short-term fluctuation as measured by the root mean square between the first and second visual field examinations. These results indicate that a learning effect did not play an important role in the clinical interpretation of automated perimetry in patients with glaucoma who have previous experience with manual perimetry. In most cases, it was not necessary to obtain more than one \"baseline\" examination unless a patient demonstrated unusually high short-term fluctuation or had visual field defects inconsistent with the rest of the clinical examination.\r"

Regular observation and questioning of patients for symptoms are thought to be preferable. The importance of a thorough history when assigning an etiology to a dyscrasia is noted.\r"

A small but statistically significant effect on aqueous humor flow was observed 2 to 7 hours after application. By 8 hours, the effect had disappeared, and intraocular pressure (IOP) measured 8 hours after application of a single dose was unchanged in these normal volunteers. The drug and its vehicle caused local side effects including irritation, hyperemia, and blurred vision. The authors wondered if multiple doses would produce a greater effect. Four subjects received up to four doses of the drug over 2 days and were restudied. Marked bulbar injection and follicular conjunctivitis, attributable to either the drug or the vehicle, developed in two of the subjects, both contact lens wearers. A milder form of bulbar injection and follicular conjunctivitis developed in a third subject, who received three doses of the drug and was not a contact lens wearer. These side effects precluded additional multiple-dose testing of this formulation of the drug, and no conclusions about the effect of the drug on aqueous flow can be drawn from this portion of the study.\r"

  ".W": "There is little agreement in the ophthalmic literature on the optimum length of time that silicone tubes should be left in place after lacrimal intubation for the treatment of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Various authors have recommended leaving the tubes in for 3 to 6 months. The authors of this article believe this to be an excessive amount of time. Lacrimal probing, inferior turbinate fracture, and silicone intubation were performed in children ranging in age from 3 months to 5 years. The tubes were removed after 6 weeks in all cases. Resolution of epiphora and dacryocystitis was achieved in all cases. Follow-up ranged from 4 to 81 months. The authors recommend that the silicone tubes be removed after 6 weeks. They also believe that fracture of the inferior turbinate should be performed along with silicone intubation.\r"

Ten hydrogel bandage contact lenses (61.4% HEMA and 38.6% water content) were soaked overnight in a 0.5% solution of sterile, unpreserved, commercially available gentamicin, and fitted thereafter on ten eyes of healthy adult volunteers. Gentamicin concentrations in the tear film were determined 10, 30, and 60 minutes, and 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after fitting, using agar diffusion bioassay. Bactericidal concentrations (greater than 1.6 micrograms/ml) were found up to 3 days after contact lens fitting in all subjects. No toxic topical or systemic effects were seen.\r"

Postoperative follow-up for the eyes treated with mitomycin eye drops ranged from 3 to 34 weeks (mean, 23 weeks). One of 44 pterygia treated with mitomycin recurred after 5 months (recurrence rate, 2.3%), whereas 16 of 18 primary pterygia treated with placebo eye drops developed postoperative granulomas and recurrent pterygia with a mean postoperative period of 6 weeks (recurrence rate, 88.9%). Topical mitomycin (1.0 mg/ml) caused conjunctival irritation, excessive lacrimation, and mild superficial punctate keratitis. These topical side effects were minimized with the 0.4 mg/ml mitomycin dosage. No systemic toxicity was noted with either dosage. The authors believe that mitomycin eye drops is a safe and effective adjunct to surgical excision in the treatment of primary or recurrent pterygia, or both.\r"

The patients' opinions of their response to therapy significantly favored suprofen on day 14 (P = 0.03); a trend for suprofen was evident on day 28 (P = 0.1). Treatment with suprofen led to a greater overall reduction in ocular signs and symptoms than with placebo.

The recovery rate in this group was 40.7%. The most significant loss of corneal sensation was in the areas central to the transverse incisions. The depth of the transverse incision, as well as the preoperative astigmatism, appeared to be factors in the loss of corneal sensation as well as in the recovery of the corneal sensitivity. There were no complications noted in this study as a result of decreased corneal sensitivity.\r"

This has been referred to as an encysted bleb, and some have recommended surgical techniques to repair it and to restore controlled IOP. This clinical picture occurred in 18 of 181 eyes (10%) undergoing simple trabeculectomy with a limbus-based conjunctival flap and tenonectomy. It did not occur among 69 eyes in which trabeculectomy with a fornix-based flap was combined with extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). Its occurrence may, therefore, be related to surgical technique. In eyes with this syndrome, the authors used IOP-lowering eyedrops and/or pills, along with continued corticosteroid eyedrops. None required surgical manipulation. All 18 eyes achieved long-term IOP control, and in 14 all medications were ultimately discontinued. An hypothesis is suggested to explain the occurrence of this event and the rationale for this therapy. A trial of IOP-lowering treatment is indicated in the management of a high bleb phase after filtering surgery.\r"

  ".W": "A long glaucoma valve implant attached to an external scleral explant was used during filtration surgery in 72 eyes: 39 eyes with neovascular glaucoma and 33 eyes with other types of secondary glaucomas or with primary glaucoma in which prior filtration surgery had failed. The implant consisted of an open Silastic tube (outside diameter, 0.64 mm), which was placed into the anterior chamber. The external end of the tube contained a pressure-sensitive (opening pressure, 11 mmHg) and unidirectional slit-valve, and was sutured within the groove of a #220 Silastic explant. The 180 degree explant was placed beneath three rectus muscles and then sutured so that the grooved side was against the sclera, with the anterior edge 8 to 12 mm posterior to the limbus. The long glaucoma valve implant resulted in a large, posterior bleb extending over the area of the Silastic explant. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) of 43.9 mmHg in the eyes with neovascular glaucoma was reduced to 17.4 mmHg after a mean follow-up of 20.2 months. The mean preoperative IOP of 38.1 mmHg in the eyes after failure of previous filtration surgery was reduced to 17.6 mmHg at a mean follow-up of 21.0 months. Postoperative IOP was less than 21 mmHg in 77% of eyes with neovascular glaucoma (47% required additional medication) and in 82% of eyes with previous failure of filtration surgery (56% required additional medication).\r"

The seton, with supplemental agents, maintained the intraocular pressure (IOP) within a therapeutic range for 6 months, until the time of death from cardiac complications. Histopathologic evaluation of the eye showed the inlet of the seton in the periphery of the anterior chamber, not in contact with a coexisting anterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL). There was no fibrosis of the intracameral portion of the device. The tissue tract containing the silicon outlet tube extended from peripheral Descemet's membrane, through the sclera, to exit in the episcleral tissue over the posterior pars plana. Fibrous tissue originating from the episclera encased the external chambers of the seton. The internal contours of the fistulous tract, i.e., that portion adjacent to the seton, were smooth. There was no gross tissue hiatus at the exit port of the seton. The posterior wall of the fibrous capsule surrounding the seton in this region was diaphanous and immediately anterior to an area of cystic tissue comprising an equatorially placed bleb. The bleb was characterized by an irregular internal surface and a cystic cavity crossed by collagenous columns, suggesting it was the sub-Tenon's reservoir of aqueous. The success of the seton in this particular case may be due to a lack of fibrous reaction in the anterior chamber and the establishment of a stable filtering bleb in the equatorial region of the eye.\r"

Nineteen patients (mean length of treatment, 44 months) were studied by measuring their baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) and aqueous humor flow during treatment and 2 days to 6 weeks after discontinuing the drug. Flow did not increase significantly until 4 days after discontinuing timolol, and IOP did not increase significantly until 14 days later. Flow did not revert to its normal rate for 2 to 6 weeks. Intraocular pressure was 15% lower and the flow 24% lower during maintenance treatment than 1 month after discontinuing timolol. This comparison demonstrates the efficacy of chronic treatment. Recovery of aqueous flow is slow after stopping timolol. This finding suggests that lower or less frequent doses than are customarily used might be equally efficacious. If timolol is discontinued before filtration surgery, its effects will remain for 2 to 4 weeks.\r"

  ".W": "Circadian rhythms in serotonin metabolism have been observed in the pineal gland and retina, and there is evidence that the levels of serotonin and melatonin in these tissues may mediate events in the brain's sleep-wake cycle and the retina's cycle of disc shedding. Because the ciliary epithelium, which produces aqueous humor, has an embryonic origin similar to that of the retina and the pineal gland, the authors believe that serotonin metabolism might play an analogous role in the regulation of the diurnal cycle of aqueous secretion. As a first step in investigating this hypothesis, they measured serotonin concentrations in the aqueous humor of 34 cataract patients. Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection, a mean serotonin concentration of 52 +/- 11 ng/ml was found. This high concentration implies that serotonin has one or more functions: (1) perhaps it acts as a neurotransmitter and precursor of melatonin; (2) conceivably it is related to aqueous humor dynamics; and (3) in particular, perhaps it affects the circadian rhythm of intraocular pressure.\r"

All of the glaucomatous eyes showed both defects. Of the 43 ocular hypertensive eyes, in which both NFL and absolute fluorescein filling defects were evaluated, 9% had only NFL defects, 19% had only fluorescein filling defects, 14% had both defects, and 58% had neither defect. The percent area of fluorescein defect in the optic disc increased with severity of NFL defect in glaucoma and ocular hypertension. This study confirms the relationship of fluorescein filling defects and NFL defects to glaucomatous abnormalities and thus the association between vascular damage to the optic nerve and axon loss in glaucoma. The earliest objective evidence of glaucomatous damage can be detected with a combination of NFL evaluation and optic disc fluorescein angiography.\r"

The atrophy of the iris was marked with a thin atrophic stroma, widely dilated pupil, and extensive loss of pigment from the posterior surface of the iris. The condition is of unknown etiology but occlusion of the greater vascular circle of the iris is possible. Iris angiography showed an almost total loss of the radial vessels of the iris with some patchy microneovascularization. In recent cases, the onset was acute and all patients had a raised intraocular pressure (IOP) except one who had already undergone a drainage operation. There was an accompanying low-grade uveitis or cyclitis in the chronic stage in all cases. The condition was unilateral and the posterior segment of the eye was normal so that good visual function was possible if the accompanying cataract and glaucoma were appropriately managed.\r"

Twenty-eight well-documented cases of NVI after CRAO were detected, an occurrence rate of 16.6%. After evaluating the intravenous fluorescein angiograms of these patients, the authors conclude that an extreme prolongation of the retinal arteriovenous transit time is an independent risk factor for the subsequent development of NVI. Twelve of 18 eyes (66.6%) in the NVI group, versus seven of 29 eyes (24.1%) in the control group, showed such prolongation (P less than 0.02).\r"

Only eight (4.6%) of these lesions showed clinical evidence of enlargement during follow-up intervals of 1 to 12 years (mean, 4.7 years). Features that were associated with enlargement of the lesion included medial location of the mass on the iris and presence of pigment dispersion onto the adjacent iris and anterior chamber angle structures. Features that were unassociated with growth of the lesion included patient age and sex, intraocular pressure, iris color, tumor size and vascularity, and presence of pupillary distortion, ectropion iridis, and sector cataract. From these results, recommendations are made which can assist the ophthalmologist in the management of pigmented iris lesions.\r"

Patients with adult onset diabetes mellitus had slight increased survival and did not alter relative mortality. The authors' results support the hypothesis that senile cataracts may reflect systemic factors in addition to localized ocular disease.\r"

Although Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes were isolated with similar frequency, 8 of 12 infants bacteremic within the first 48 hours of life were infected with Gram-positive, penicillin G-susceptible organisms whereas 11 of 17 infants older than 2 days were bacteremic with Gram-negative, penicillin G-resistant anaerobes. Eleven of 17 infants with anaerobic bacteremia associated with necrotizing enterocolitis were bacteremic with Gram-negative anaerobes. Five of 6 infants with anaerobic bacteremia associated with chorioamnionitis were bacteremic with Gram-positive anaerobes. These observations should be considered in making decisions regarding empiric therapy for the newborn at highest risk for anaerobic bacteremia.\r"

We investigated whether the prevalence of atopic dermatitis is increased among children who acquire Kawasaki disease.

The interviewer was blinded to the hypothesis of the study. Nine (11%) Kawasaki disease patients but only one (1%) unaffected child had atopic dermatitis; the incidence of atopic dermatitis among children with Kawasaki disease was 9 times greater than that of controls (95% confidence limits, 1.6 to 49.4). Serum immunoglobulin E concentrations were significantly higher (P = 0.02, Mann-Whitney) in 44 unselected Kawasaki disease patients (median, 22; range, less than or equal to 4 to 900 IU/ml) studied 6 to 12 months after onset than in 27 children of similar age (median, less than or equal to 4; range, less than or equal to 4 to 164 IU/ml).
