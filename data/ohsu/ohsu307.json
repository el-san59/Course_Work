  ".W": "The clinical and electrophysiological features of 50 consecutive patients with the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) have been analysed. Carcinoma was detected (CD group) in 25, of whom 21 had small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC was evident within 2 yrs of onset of LEMS symptoms in 20/21 cases, and at 3.8 yrs in 1/21. In the cases in whom no carcinoma was detected (NCD group), 14/25 had a history of LEMS greater than 5 yrs. The dominant neurological features were similar in the CD and NCD groups, and consisted of proximal lower limb weakness (100%), depressed tendon reflexes (92%) with posttetanic potentiation (78%), autonomic features, especially dryness of the mouth (74%) and mild/moderate ptosis (54%). The compound evoked muscle action potential amplitude in abductor digiti minimi was below the lower limit of control values in 48/50, and the increment following maximum voluntary contraction above the upper limit of control values in 48/50. Single fibre electromyographic abnormalities were found in 29/29 cases. The analysis indicates that a patient presenting with LEMS has a 62% risk of an underlying SCLC, and that this risk declines sharply after 2 yrs, becoming very low at 4 to 5 yrs. It is argued that in SCLC cases antigenic determinants on tumour cells initiate the autoimmune response, often early in the course of the malignancy, but that the association of LEMS with tumours other than SCLC may be fortuitous. In the latter, and in NCD patients, the initiating factor(s) are unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Although the symptom complex of disseminated cysticercosis has been well recognized for over half a century, it is not clearly included in recent disease classifications. Three such patients are described whose main features were uncontrolled seizures, progressive dementia, behaviour disorder, muscular pseudohypertrophy, and a relative paucity of localizing neurological signs or signs of raised intracranial pressure. Radiographic calcification in muscles was not seen. A CT scan of the brain showed numerous small discrete lesions. Their attenuation density values were appreciably less than that of calcium and they enhanced slightly with contrast. Magnification revealed that these were scolices within cysticerci. There was no enhancement of the cyst wall and no pericystic oedema. CT scan of muscles showed similar cysticerci producing a 'honeycomb' appearance. This is the first CT demonstration of widely disseminated living cysticerci in brain and muscles. It was confirmed histologically. In the absence of palpable cysticerci, the clinical diagnosis can be missed, although no other disease in its full form presents in this manner. The symptoms are mainly caused by the space-occupying effect of the large number of cysticerci rather than by adjacent tissue swelling such as is seen in the presence of dying parasites. Praziquantel was ineffective and hazardous, causing some known and some previously unreported responses and reactions. All 3 patients died.\r"

All 4 had left internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion with ipsilateral anterior pial territory infarction (precentral-central sulcus artery territory) and watershed infarction between the middle and posterior cerebral artery territories, which spared and 'isolated' the perisylvian speech areas. Although rare, acute TMA is highly suggestive of infarction due to ICA occlusion, in that it is probably related to simultaneous embolism (anterior pial infarction) and haemodynamic insufficiency (posterior watershed infarction).\r"

  ".W": "Visually directed arm movements have been studied by film recordings in 10 patients with optic ataxia resulting from unilateral lesions of the parietal region, in 3 cases on the right and in 7 on the left. Half of the patients also underwent visuospatial perceptive tests. The results indicate the following. (1) Optic ataxia is a specific visuomotor disorder, independent of visual space misperception. (2) The proximal and the distal components of the movements are equally affected as shown in reaching and hand orientation tasks. (3) The percentages of spatial and orientation errors quantified, respectively, in these two situations show a different distribution across the different hand-field combinations according to the side of the lesion: whereas the right-damaged patients show a deficit essentially related to a field effect, the left-damaged patients show in addition to the latter an impairment related to a hand effect. These findings suggest that the 2 types of visuomotor mechanisms responsible for the proximal and distal components of visually-directed arm movements are controlled by the parietal cortex and that there should exist a hemisphere asymmetry in the functional organization of these mechanisms. (4) Reconstruction of the lesions drawn from CT scans in 8 of the patients shows a salient and constant involvement of the posterior parietal cortex, always including the intraparietal sulcus and either the superior part of the inferior parietal lobule or more often various parts of the superior parietal lobule. The weak co-occurrence of optic ataxia and hemispatial neglect, and their different lesion sites, indicate a double dissociation between these two symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "To study the pathophysiology of immunologically mediated demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS), we injected 20 to 30 microliters of polyclonal antigalactocerebroside serum (AGC) into the lower thoracic dorsal column of the spinal cord in 20 Wistar rats. AGC-injected spinal cords contained areas of fascicular demyelination adjacent to the focus of axonal degeneration at the injection site. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded serially after tibial nerve stimulation. In 85% of AGC-injected animals, the following characteristics were observed by 3 days after injection: (1) decreased amplitude of the cortically generated potential (P15); (2) failure of transmission of high-frequency (50 Hz) impulses (rate-dependent block); (3) delayed conduction velocity of the compound action potentials through the lesion. None of these changes was seen in 90% of 20 rats injected with normal saline or control rabbit sera. In 7 rats with acrylamide-induced axonopathy or wallerian degeneration, the rate-dependent block was not observed. The onset of clinical symptoms (hindlimb ataxia) in AGC-injected rats was best correlated with development of the rate-dependent block. Clinical recovery was observed by 14 days after injection concurrent with restoration of P15 amplitude, when the rate-dependent block and decreased conduction velocities were unchanged. High-frequency-resistant conduction was re-established much later than clinical recovery in 3 rats. These findings suggest that failure of high-frequency impulse transmission may produce clinical symptoms and that a central adaptive mechanism to remodulated trains of impulses plays a role in clinical recovery from CNS demyelination.\r"

  ".W": "Groups of patients with dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease, together with age and IQ-matched normal controls, were compared on several computerized tests of visuospatial memory and learning. Two different groups of parkinsonian patients were studied: (1) a newly diagnosed group, early in the course of the disease, not receiving medication (NMED) PD) and (2) a group later in the course of the disease, receiving medication (MED PD). The DAT and MED PD group were significantly impaired in both spatial and visual pattern recognition memory. The DAT group exhibited a delay-dependent deficit (over 0-16 s) in a delayed matching-to-sample procedure, but were not impaired at simultaneous-matching-to-sample. By contrast, the MED PD group showed delay-independent deficits in the delayed matching-to-sample test and both the MED PD and the NMED PD group were also significantly impaired in simultaneous matching. In a form of delayed response test, the subjects were required first to memorize and then to learn the locations of several abstract visual stimuli which varied progressively in number from 1 to 8. The DAT group were severely impaired in this conditional associative learning task. A significant proportion of patients, but none of the controls, in the NMED and MED PD group also failed the test at the levels of 6 or 8 items. There was a significant correlation between the performance on the first trial, memory score in the delayed response task and indices of clinical disability and disease duration in the patients with Parkinson's disease. The results are discussed in terms of the utility of the comparison between DAT and PD in characterizing the nature of the cognitive deficits in these conditions and their relation to those findings from animal neuropsychology which use comparable paradigms.\r"

  ".W": "Movement-related cortical potentials (MRPs) were recorded from scalp electrodes in 8 normal volunteers and from chronically implanted subdural electrodes in 7 patients who were being evaluated for surgical treatment of epilepsy. From subdural electrodes, a clearly defined, extremely localized slow negative potential preceding the voluntary movement of the middle finger (Bereitschaftspotential, BP) was recorded in the contralateral and ipsilateral hand sensorimotor areas. The negative slope (NS') began approximately 250 to 400 ms before EMG onset and was recorded exclusively from the contralateral hand sensorimotor area. Both BP and NS' were maximum in the hand motor area. Although a negative slope was recorded also from the supplementary motor area, whether that particular slope corresponded to BP or NS', or both, could not be determined. Three kinds of progressively steeper negative potentials starting around the onset of the EMG were identified: (1) the 'hand motor potentials' which were seen in the contralateral hand motor area and started immediately before EMG onset and peaked 130 +/- 32 ms after EMG onset; (2) the 'hand somatosensory potentials' seen in the contralateral hand somatosensory area which started simultaneously or immediately after the EMG onset; and (3) the 'vicinity potentials' seen in the immediate surroundings of the contralateral hand area and which started after the EMG onset. The 'hand motor potentials' had the highest amplitude. From these findings, we concluded that bilateral hand sensorimotor areas and the supplementary motor area participate in the 'preparation' of movements, but that mainly the contralateral cortex generates the discharges necessary to produce the actual movement.\r"

The highest rates were observed in those areas having high socioeconomic levels. In communities with multiple racial groups the highest rates were in Caucasians. Migrant populations retained rates close to those found in the country of origin. The majority of populations showed modest increases only while about one-third showed a decrease in the incidence rates during a period of approximately 15 years. Overall, there was a male excess. It is suggested that differences in medical practices (including availability of specialist expertise), diagnostic facilities and individual registry practices account for some of the variations observed. However, the possible aetiological roles of genetic, racial, hormonal and environmental factors need to be evaluated to explain the consistently higher incidence rates in Caucasians and in males of all races.\r"

During the year before school entry the parents gave a health, developmental and behavioural history during an interview with a community health nurse, and the children underwent vision and hearing screening tests and the Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST). At the end of the 1980-81 school year the kindergarten teachers rated the children's learning problems. At the end of the 1982-83 school year the presence of school problems was ascertained, and the predictive accuracy of items from the preschool history and examination and of the kindergarten teachers' ratings was calculated. The health, developmental and behavioural history with or without the DDST was found to predict later school problems with acceptable accuracy. The kindergarten teachers' ratings gave slightly more accurate predictions. We conclude that in communities where prompt diagnostic evaluation and effective therapeutic or preventive help can be provided to children identified as being at high risk, health professionals may play a useful role in screening for future school problems.\r"

There was no change in the number of deaths among North American Indians. There was also no change in the number of deaths due to hypertension, most of which were avoidable; these findings have stimulated intensive teaching efforts to increase recognition and improve management of the problem. Review of maternal deaths can help identify deficiencies in the quality of care and can direct measures aimed at further reducing the maternal death rate.\r"

  ".W": "The role of chemotherapy in the management of patients with cancer of the paranasal sinus has not been defined. An analysis of 24 evaluable patients treated with chemotherapy as part of their overall therapy was performed. There were 16 male patients and eight female patients. Sixteen patients were previously untreated and eight had recurrent disease after surgery and/or radiotherapy. Six of the previously untreated patients had metastatic disease on presentation (four central nervous system (CNS) and two lung), and four recurrent patients had CNS involvement. The majority of patients (78%) had squamous cell carcinoma. The chemotherapy regimens included cisplatin (CDDP), vincristine (VCR), and bleomycin (COB), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion and CDDP, or 5-FU/CDDP and methotrexate (MTX). All patients had computed tomography (CT) measurable disease. Previously untreated patients underwent surgery and/or radiotherapy postchemotherapy. The overall response rate to chemotherapy for previously untreated patients was 82% (complete response [CR] 44%, partial response [PR] 38%) and for recurrent patients 88% (CR 38%, PR 50%). Predominant toxicities were nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression, mucositis, and renal impairment. The median survival of the previously untreated patients, based on response to chemotherapy, was as follows: CR 21+ months (range, 10+ to 81 months), PR 13.5 months (range, 2 to 21 months), and no response (NR) 3 months (range, 1 to 7 months). The median survival of patients with recurrent disease was as follows: CR 16 months, PR 13.5 months, and NR 5 months. We conclude that patients with paranasal cancers are responsive to CDDP-containing combinations. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in previously untreated, locally advanced patients needs to be demonstrated by future randomized trials.\r"

Nineteen percent of all tumors were lobular carcinomas. Overall, the rate of receptor discordance between the two tumors was not significantly different from that previously reported between biopsies of primary tumor and metastases in patients with unilateral breast cancer. Synchronous receptor-positive tumors occurred significantly more frequently than expected, suggesting that the development of the two tumors was influenced by a common mechanism. In patients with asynchronous bilateral breast cancer there was a significantly longer interval between tumors if both were receptor-positive compared with concordant receptor-negative tumors and tumors with discordant receptor status. There was a significant discordance in the receptor status of asynchronous tumors when the histology also differed, indicating that the tumors in this group were likely to be separate primary tumors.\r"

The term, premalignant, here refers to lesions with an increased risk of developing into breast cancer (atypical hyperplasia and, to a lesser extent, moderate or florid hyperplasia). The classifications by cytometry were compared with the microscopic diagnoses of the same FNA samples and of tissue from a subsequent surgical biopsy of the same area. One slide from each breast FNA sample was restained in Azure-A Feulgen. Breast epithelial cells were measured using a texture analysis program on the Leitz TAS-plus. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and interquartile range were calculated for each of 12 nuclear parameters from 200 cells per slide. A discriminant analysis was used to develop a statistical model for classifying individual samples. Six of seven atypical proliferative lesions (atypical hyperplasia and moderate hyperplasia) were identified by image cytometry, but were unrecognized by conventional microscopic examination.\r"

Forty-four percent (84 of 193) of all patients had CEA levels higher than 5 ng/ml, 66% (111 of 168) had NSE levels higher than 12.5 ng/ml, and 32% (40 of 123) had CK-BB levels higher than 10 ng/ml. Clear pathologic levels were less frequently observed. Significantly higher pretreatment titers for CEA, NSE, and CK-BB were found in patients with bone marrow and/or liver metastases. The most elevated marker levels were observed in the group of nonresponding patients with bone marrow and/or liver metastases. Only a slight correlation between the pretreatment CEA level and survival time could be observed. Patients with pathologic NSE (greater than or equal to 30 ng/ml) levels and, in particular, those with pathologic CK-BB (greater than or equal to 25 ng/ml) levels had a significantly shorter median survival than those with normal or elevated levels. In addition, a positive linear correlation between pretreatment NSE and CK-BB (n = 116, r = 0.54) levels was found, but CEA levels did not correlate with other marker levels. From these data it is concluded that pretreatment CEA, NSE, and CK-BB levels are helpful in the clinical management of a subset of patients with SCLC, i.e., those with bone marrow and/or liver metastases.\r"

By immunoperoxidase technique, proliferative and secretive endometrium showed capillary and epithelial cell basement membranes with linear staining with antibodies to both laminin and type IV collagen. Immunostaining of laminin and type IV collagen showed that capillaries were surrounded by a continuous perivascular sheath of these matrices in specimens of adenomatous hyperplasia and in nearly all specimens of endometrial adenocarcinoma. Laminin and type IV collagen were found to accumulate around glandular epithelial cells of adenomatous hyperplastic endometrium, but in several specimens these linear surrounding formations were defective and discontinuous. In several areas of well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinomas BM-like structures were found around glandular epithelial cells as shadows without staining for laminin and type IV collagen. These basement membrane components accumulate around stromal cells to encircle each cell with a gradual, progressive, and cyclic process depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. Laminin and type IV collagen were clearly detected around stromal cells at days 20 to 22 of the menstrual cycle and more thickly at days 26 to 28. The accumulation of these matrices around stromal cells is a progesterone/progestin-related process. In the well-differentiated adenocarcinoma a mid-term treatment with progestin (Danatrol Maggioni-Winthrop, SPA, Milan, Italy) was found to be effective on laminin and type IV collagen accumulation around stromal cells.\r"

Chronic renal failure secondary to radiation nephritis precluded the use of streptozotocin. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (300 mg/m2 per day) was given as a continuous, systemic infusion through a chronic indwelling central venous catheter for 1 year's duration. Treatment resulted in the prompt disappearance of all signs and symptoms of cancer, and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen documented complete response. The patient continues in complete clinical remission 16 months after 5-FU was stopped. Continuous 5-FU infusion may be a potentially efficacious and less toxic alternative to streptozotocin in the treatment of islet cell carcinoma. Further clinical evaluation will be necessary to define its overall role in the management of these patients.\r"

Ependymoblastomas were all situated above the tentorium and occurred only in young children. We identified three tumor groups on the basis of common histologic characteristics: benign ependymomas, anaplastic ependymomas, and ependymoblastomas. The main features useful for the grouping were the degree of differentiation and anaplasia. Ependymomas from the cauda equina showed histologic characteristics that allowed them to be differentiated from other benign ependymomas. In each group the particular histologic characteristics, age, and location were significant in terms of diagnosis and prognosis. This method of analysis may help to more precisely define ependymomas and may provide pathologists and clinicians with a quantifiable diagnostic tool that may be of help in establishing the appropriate treatment.\r"

Sun damage as evidenced by solar elastosis was histologically estimated in contiguous skin. Patients' age at diagnosis, tumor site, pathologic stage, evidence of tumor regression, and coexisting sun damage were correlated with the presence or absence of melanocytic dysplasia. Patients whose tumors displayed residual dysplasia were younger and demonstrated a more favorable tumor stage and less evidence of sun damage. Melanomas on the trunk were more likely to be associated with melanocytic dysplasia than those from other areas. The findings support the belief that dysplastic nevi have an important role in the genesis of superficial spreading melanoma. The influence of ultraviolet radiation in the development of dysplastic nevi and in their potential malignant progression is discussed.\r"

A comparison of the toxicities of these two regimens shows that VAB caused significantly more mucosal, dermatologic, and otologic toxicity than PVB, and PVB caused more leucopenia. Both regimens were equally effective in controlling cancer. Either regimen could be used as chemotherapy in testicular cancer, and the decision about which one to use could be based on their differences in toxicity and degree of patient convenience.\r"

The risk of metastasis could not be predicted by the clinical or pathologic size, tumor depth, proximal location, recurrence before presentation or subsequent to treatment at our institution, the type of surgical and adjuvant therapies, and the adequacy of surgical margins. The median age of patients with metastases was 10 years older than the other patients (57.5 years and 47.5 years, respectively). Of the more common sarcomas in this study, malignant peripheral nerve tumors and malignant fibrous histiocytomas had the highest prevalence of metastasis (27% (three of 11) and 17% (three of 18), respectively). Although patients with low-grade extremity sarcomas treated during the first 5 years of this review had an increased rate of metastasis, no other patient, tumor, or treatment variable examined significantly differed between the two time periods. Although grade alone is a good predictor of the risk of metastasis from soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity, 14% of patients in this series with low-grade histology developed metastases. Further review of larger numbers of these tumors should be undertaken in an effort to more definitively identify risk factors predictive of metastatic potential in low-grade sarcomas.\r"

Two of the three lesions exhibited multifocality, and all demonstrated aggressive biologic courses. The varied histologic features of angiosarcoma make this diagnosis difficult to establish in an unusual location such as the gastrointestinal tract. The use of immunohistochemistry for a panel of antibodies, particularly the successful reaction with Factor VIII-related antigen, is important in evaluating light microscopically unusual tumors. A delicate framework of collagen type IV was elicited in each case, but ultrastructurally correlated with short segments of basal lamina in one case. This suggests that the absence of the traditional morphologic expression of basal lamina does not preclude its presence and emphasizes the sensitivity of immunohistochemistry. The lack of previously reported cases of gastrointestinal angiosarcoma may be because the tumor is underrecognized or because it is truly a rare occurrence.\r"

Neither the ovarian tumor recurred nor the enchondromas underwent sarcomatous change after a follow-up period of 7 years. A review of the literature showed five previous cases, three associated with OD and two with Mafucci's syndrome (MS). In these cases, patients were young and the ovarian tumors were homolateral to the hemicorporal side involved by enchondromatosis.

Seventy-five percent (55 of 73) of the patients had a histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma, whereas 25% (18 of 73) had squamous cell carcinoma. After two cycles of chemotherapy, patients without evidence of progressive disease received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) and chest radiotherapy, followed by two additional cycles of chemotherapy. Brain computed tomography (CT) scans were performed at 3-month intervals after completion of therapy in all patients, and were additionally performed whenever signs or symptoms developed suggesting neurologic dysfunction or recurrent brain disease. Sixty-five patients were treated with PCI. No clinical or CT evidence of recurrence in the brain has developed in patients who completed PCI. PCI appears to be effective in greatly reducing the incidence of brain relapse in patients with limited NSCLC.\r"

  ".U": "88253119\r", 
  ".W": "Among 51 countries, those having high mortality rates for male lung cancer generally have high rates for female breast cancer (highest in England, Scotland, and the Netherlands). Conversely, those having low rates for one disease have low rates for both (P less than 0.001). Mortality rates available for 23 of the countries for 1954, 1964, and 1974 show a constant relationship of the female breast cancer rate, y = 13.3 + 0.17x (where x is the male lung cancer rate). Where data on 1950 tobacco consumption are available (20 countries), an even closer relationship with female breast cancer mortality in 1974 is observed. Because women in many of these countries account for only a small fraction of the tobacco consumption, the conclusion is that the risk of the female disease is closely related to the extent of male smoking. Thus, breast cancer is apparently initiated by the involuntary inhalation of indoor tobacco smoke for more than two decades on the average before diagnosis. The same relationship between female breast and male lung cancer is found in incidence rates for 80 populations of five continents, including northern and western populations of the US. Trends in age-adjusted breast cancer incidence rates rose almost 50% in many of these populations from 1950 to 1975. This increase corresponds to a tripling of cigarette consumption in the US from 1927 to 1952. There is a strong need to analyze passive smoking more than two decades before diagnosis as a confounding variable in all studies of other risk factors for breast cancer such as alcohol, dietary fat, and endogenous or exogenous estrogen. Comparison of incidence rates for lung cancer and lifetime cigarette consumption in various cultures of Hawaii indicates that even for male smokers, additional exposure to high levels of indoor tobacco smoke greatly increases their risk of lung cancer. This brings the safety of designated smoking areas into serious question.\r"

In this article the prognostic significance of CMI as measured by a skin window (SW) procedure is reported. The procedure examines cellular responses to coverslip-mounted sections of autologous breast cancer tissue that have been applied to a microabrasion of the skin. Using criteria routinely employed in conventional hematologic and pathologic diagnoses, diverse patterns of SW responses can be identified. Specific patterns are recognizable that are consistent with CMI and that vary significantly with stage and subsequent behavior of the disease. Intrastage variations in behavior were found for patients with invasive breast cancer according to nuclear grade (NG) and postoperative SW reactivity to autologous breast cancer. Positive SW reactivity was associated with a significantly reduced risk of metastases and also appeared to impede the occurrence of metachronous second primary invasive breast cancers. The findings demonstrate the current value of NG and SW response characteristics with regard to prognosis and immunotherapy. Moreover, they are consistent with the development of immunoprophylaxis.\r"

By radioimmunoassay, CgA could be detected in the cells and culture media of all of the classical SCLC cell lines tested. Many of the classical SCLC cell lines also produced calcitonin (CT). These studies demonstrate that CgA production is a common feature of SCLC cell lines, especially those with neuroendocrine characteristics.\r"

First, undecalcified ground sections of bone metastases were made from four patients with renal cell carcinoma. Second, renal cell carcinoma cell line (RCC-K1) was established from one of the four patients, and its effect on bone resorption in vitro was examined. Marked proliferation and activation of osteoclasts around the tumor cells was histologically demonstrated. Conditioned medium from the RCC-K1 cells contained potent bone-resorbing activity in vitro. The activity was reduced to basal level by calcitonin, but was not blocked by indomethacin. The activity was lost after dialysis (MW cutoff 3500), while it was retained after 2 weeks of storage. Levels of prostaglandin E2 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D of the RCC-K1-conditioned medium were insufficient to cause bone resorption in vitro. The conditioned medium did not stimulate cAMP accumulation in rat osteoblastic cells. These results suggest that renal cell carcinoma causes bone destruction through the stimulation of osteoclasts by locally secreting an unknown humoral factor or factors.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and sixty-one patients who were treated with nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisolone (MOPP) chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease have been observed for a median of 10.2 years. Eighty-two percent of those patients received MOPP after relapse from previous irradiation. The complete response (CR) rate was 71%. For the 116 patients achieving CR the relapse-free survival at 5 years was 83% and at 10 years, 79%. The overall survival was 72% at 5 years and 64% at 10 years. In a stepwise logistic regression analysis the most important clinical factors influencing response were B symptoms at presentation (fever greater than 38 degrees C, night sweats, weight loss greater than 10% of body weight), histologic subtype, and lung or pleural involvement. Patients who received MOPP as first-line therapy had a significantly worse response rate than those who received MOPP upon relapse after radiotherapy. This difference is reduced when adjustments are made for the presence of the above prognostic factors. A Cox regression analysis showed that Stage IV at presentation and lymphocyte-depleted histology were the most important factors indicating reduced survival. Patients who achieved a CR to MOPP had a significantly improved survival. Of the 65 patients who had died at the time of the analysis of this series, 46 died of progressive Hodgkin's disease. All four patients who developed secondary acute nonlymphocytic leukemia had received radiation as well as MOPP.\r"

  ".W": "The results of therapy given to 74 children with advanced disease, abdominal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were retrospectively evaluated with respect to the major prognostic factors related to disease outcome. The first 36 patients admitted in the study were treated with a modified LSA2-L2 protocol, and the remaining patients received the same regimen with the addition of intermediate-dose methotrexate (MTX) intravenously during the induction phase (LSA2-L2-MTX). The last ten patients admitted were given a leucovorin rescue along with the administration of MTX. The relative efficacy of the LSA2-L2-MTX over the baseline LSA2-L2 regimen was analyzed by multivariate statistical methods taking into consideration several candidate coprognostic factors. The risk of treatment failure was substantially reduced (55%) with the use of the LSA2-L2-MTX regimen. Rescue with leucovorin did not contribute a further significant gain in treatment efficacy, although fewer toxicity-related problems were observed as compared to the no-rescue period. Five prognostic factors emerged as significantly explanatory of the risk of treatment failure in addition to protocol type: lymphocyte count, disease stage, surgical debulking, sex, and nutritional status. Based on these variables, a logistic regression equation could be derived to identify groups that were at risk for treatment failure.\r"

  ".W": "Between May 1981 and January 1986, 130 consecutive patients with advanced untreated head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with two or three courses of the CABO combination (methotrexate 40 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 15; CDDP 50 mg/m2 IV on day 4; bleomycin 10 mg IV on days 1, 8, and 15; and vincristine 2 mg IV on days 1, 8, and 15 every 3 weeks) prior to surgery and/or radiotherapy. Of the 123 patients evaluable for response to chemotherapy, 19 (15.4%) had a complete remission and 59 (48%) a partial response, yielding a 63.4% overall response rate. Response rate was significantly correlated with the performance status (PS) (P = 0.001), the stage (P = 0.005), and the T class (P = 0.02); 107 patients completed subsequent local treatment (87 with radiotherapy and 20 with surgery +/- radiotherapy). The median survival of the 124 patients evaluable for survival was 14.7 months and the overall survival rate at 3 years was 24%. The median survival and the overall survival at 3 years for the surgical subgroup were 24.7 months and 38% and for the radiotherapy subgroup were 14.3 months and 22%. These results were compared with those obtained in a historical control group of 79 patients treated in our institute with short courses of chemotherapy regimens, which did not include cisplatin, followed by radiotherapy (29 patients) or local treatments alone (26 patients with radiotherapy and 24 patients with surgery +/- radiotherapy) between January 1976 and December 1980. Most of the patient characteristics were evenly distributed (age, sex, and primary sites) except that more advanced lesions were included in the NAC group (Stage IV: 85% versus 62%; T4: 65% versus 42%; N2-3: 48% versus 29%). The overall survival was significantly higher in patients receiving NAC than in the historical control group, comparing both the groups taken as a whole (P less than 0.05) and the surgery +/- radiotherapy (P less than 0.05) and the radiotherapy (P less than 0.02) subgroups. This experience suggests a positive role of NAC on survival. However, this improvement in outcome compared with a historical control group cannot be regarded as definitive evidence for benefit to patients. Randomized studies using active regimens are required to confirm these data.\r"

The 2-year survival rate was 33% and the 5-year survival rate was 32%. Patients with isolated skeletal metastases showed the best survival rate (2-year survival rate, 69%; 5-year survival rate, 60%). Isolated pulmonary, other parenchymal, and central nervous system (CNS) metastases showed a lower 2-year survival rate of 15%. Regardless of the site of metastases and the size of the primary, histologic grade appeared to have a substantial impact on the survival of our patients. The beneficial results of interstitial radiation therapy are attributed to reduction of tumor burden and possibly the stimulation of the host immune response that may initiate remission. The noticeably better results in patients with osseous metastases are attributed to the resolute treatment of all osseous metastases by additional interstitial iodine 125 (125I) infarct implants. Conversely, the poor results in patients with CNS and other parenchymal metastases may be based on the inability to treat such metastases with 125I interstitial infarct implants. In addition to clinical observations of weight gain and the cessation of pain and hematuria if present, remissions are heralded by normalization of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, disappearance of tumor markers if present, and rise of beta interferon levels. The technique is advocated for the management of inoperable renal cell carcinoma with distant metastases.\r"

Levels of cystathionine synthase varied from undetectable to 622 pmol/mg protein, but no specimen had cystathionase measurable by rocket radioimmunoassay or catalytic assay. In addition, we assayed neuroblastoma cell lines exposed to a variety of differentiating agents: butyric acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, serum-free medium, or sodium citrate to induce differentiation. In each case we were unable to demonstrate cystathionase induction. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that neuroblastomas have a biochemical block in the transsulfuration enzymes at the level of cystathionase and that expression of cystathionine synthase in the absence of cystathionase may account for the presence of cystathioninuria in patients with neuroblastoma.\r"

Results were compared with those obtained in one lung epidermoid carcinoma and one parathyroid adenoma from adult patients. Elevated plasma immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) concentrations were observed in three of five children. The only tumor in which PTH-RNA hybridization could be detected was the parathyroid adenoma. The integrity of the RNA preparations was further confirmed by positive hybridization obtained with a glucagon DNA probe in both normal pancreas and the rhabdoid tumors. Quantitative bone histomorphometry of tumor-bearing nude mice showed a reduction in bone formation and increased bone resorption, the opposite of what occurs in hyperparathyroidism. The PTH-like protein, which was detected by radioimmunoassays (RIA) in the sera of three patients, could not be correlated with tumor PTH mRNA transcription within the limits of our assays. In order to explain this discrepancy, we suggest that the tumors produce a factor (not PTH) which, in turn, elicits the excess iPTH which we detected by RIA.\r"

DNA distribution patterns were grouped into low and high ploidies. The 24.0% frequency in the high ploidy group, at the mucosal stage, increased in proportion to invasion into the deeper layers. There was a high incidence of lymph node metastasis in the high ploidy group, compared with the low ploidy group, in case of invasion beyond the mucosa. Widespread nodal involvement was frequent in the high ploidy group. The 5-year survival rate was 73.7% in patients of high ploidy, with a statistical difference compared to the 90.6% in those of low ploidy (P less than 0.01). In the multivariate analysis of 226 patients undergoing curative surgery, the DNA ploidy proved to be a major independent prognostic factor. These findings indicate a close correlation among DNA ploidy, tumor invasion and nodal involvement, and the significant clinical value of DNA analysis for predicting the prognosis in patients with gastric carcinoma.\r"

The original diagnosis and the diagnoses of a nationwide panel of local reference pathologists (LRPs) from 104 cases were reviewed and the technical quality of each biopsy evaluated. Using a modified Rappaport classification, there was agreement in 57% of cases among the panel. This increased to 84% when diagnoses were grouped according to Working Formulation grades. Of the 90 cases in which a comparison of the contributing pathologist's diagnosis and the most common panel diagnosis was possible, there was exact agreement in 51% (kappa = 0.311) of cases and agreement regarding WF grade in 68% (kappa = 0.318). Major panel disagreements occurred in 26 (25%) cases, involving the distinction of metastatic anaplastic carcinoma or Hodgkin's disease from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 17 cases and follicular versus diffuse architecture in 16 (overlap present). The contributing pathologist had a major disagreement with the panel in 18 cases (20%), of type and frequency similar to those within the panel itself. Poor fixation (complete or partial) was present in 49 cases (47%); this resulted in significantly fewer majority agreements than in the well-fixed group (25% versus 60%, P = 0.020) and also increased rates of disagreement in the diagnosis of lymphoma versus anaplastic carcinoma. Thus improvements in the technical quality of biopsy material could further improve the diagnostic accuracy of lymphoma diagnosis.\r"

As an additional control group, subjects with benign pulmonary diseases were investigated. The control groups and all the groups with malignant tumors except the mesotheliomas had serum hyaluronan values equal to or only slightly higher than those of healthy volunteers of the same age. The patients with mesotheliomas had significantly elevated hyaluronan levels (287 +/- 282 [Standard deviation] micrograms/l; n = 35; P less than 0.001) compared with healthy volunteers (54 +/- 28 micrograms/l in the age group of 51 to 60 years).

  ".W": "Four hundred nine consecutive breast cancer patients were studied retrospectively. Microspectrophotometric DNA measurements were performed using archival, fine-needle slide preparations upon which the primary diagnoses had been based 8 to 13 years earlier. The DNA distribution patterns of the tumor cell populations were analyzed according to various criteria and the cytochemical data were correlated to the clinical course, defined as distant recurrence-free survival. The results demonstrated a strong relationship between nuclear DNA content of the breast cancer cells and prognosis. Tumors exhibiting DNA values within the limits of normal tissues (DNA euploidy) were found to be correlated with a favorable prognosis. In contrast, tumors with increased and scattered DNA values (DNA aneuploidy) were found indicative of poor prognosis. This was found to be the case regardless whether the percentage of cells above 2.5c or 5c, DNA index/modal value, or the histogram typing according to Auer et al were utilized to discriminate low-grade from high-grade malignant cases. All of these DNA variables were also shown to be significantly correlated. With the aid of the Cox regression method, the additional prognostic value of any given variable was tested against the others. The statistical analyses showed that the histogram typing gives significant prognostic information in addition to that provided by any other variable. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that tumor nuclear DNA content is a strong indicator of prognosis in patients suffering from invasive breast adenocarcinoma. However, the results also show that simple determination of the stemline position is not the optimal DNA measure of intrinsic tumor malignancy potential. The fraction of cells scattered outside the modal peaks of the histograms are of utmost importance for adequate cytochemical malignancy grading in breast carcinomas.\r"

  ".W": "The increased risk of thrombosis seen in patients with malignancy also was recently confirmed in breast cancer patients undergoing hormonal or chemotherapeutic treatment. Besides changes within the coagulation system, alterations of hemorheologic variables have been implicated in the genesis of thrombosis. We evaluated plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation, fibrinogen level, sedimentation rate, hematocrit concentration, and protein concentration in patients with breast cancer at the time of primary diagnosis and during follow-up with or without treatment. We then compared the results to a control group without malignant or infectious disease. Plasma viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation were significantly higher in patients with malignant disease, with a further increase at the time of dissemination. Plasma fibrinogen level was significantly higher only at the time of dissemination. The influence of therapy on hemorheologic variables was minor. Tumor volume was the most important factor. As individual values vary considerably and form a continuous spectrum, no cutoff line between normal and pathologic values can be defined. However, high values should induce further measures to diagnose metastatic disease. Second, these factors could explain the relative inefficiency of thrombosis prophylaxis in this patient group and suggest the addition of rheologically active drugs to the treatment regimen.\r"

Before operation patients with esophageal cancer, but not those with lung cancer, had significantly lower plasma total protein and albumin than patients with hiatus hernia. After surgery plasma albumin and total protein fell in both esophageal cancer and hiatus hernia patients, a development attributed to poor nutrition and restricted calorie diet in these two groups of patients respectively. With the exception of alanine and arginine in lung cancer patients, and free tryptophan in lung and esophageal cancer patients, the preoperative concentrations of all plasma amino acids were similar in both groups of cancer patients and in those with hiatus hernia. After operation the concentrations of glutamine, total tryptophan, alanine, glycine, and arginine fell sharply, whereas those of phenylalanine, lysine, valine, and leucine were slightly or not at all affected by surgery. The immediate postoperative fall of plasma free amino acids is thought to be due to the increased rate of gluconeogenesis. The rise of free fraction of plasma tryptophan after surgery is related to the raised level of plasma free fatty acids and increased secretions of catecholamines, which is believed to follow surgery.\r"

Ultra-structural correlations were attempted with several tumors. All categories of common benign and malignant epithelial tumors were examined. Antibodies used in the study included antikeratins (AE1/AE3, 35BH11, 34BE12), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and vimentin. All ovarian epithelial tumors expressed keratin in uniform fashion, except high molecular weight keratin (34BE12) which was focal. Vimentin was coexpressed with cytokeratins in 42% of serous carcinomas, 71% of endometrioid carcinomas, and 7% of clear cell carcinomas. Vimentin decoration in serous carcinoma was very focal, whereas endometrioid decoration tended to involve larger areas, similar to uterine-based endometrial adenocarcinoma. Mucinous, Brenner, and solid (not otherwise specified) ovarian tumors were positive only for cytokeratin. Carcinoembryonic antigen luminal staining was present in 52% of serous carcinomas and 87% of mucinous carcinomas. Whereas there are distinct differences in intermediate filament expression among ovarian carcinomas, these differences do not allow for specific categorization of ovarian neoplasms because there is some overlap of intermediate filament expression. In order to differentiate ovarian carcinoma from other carcinomas and mesothelioma, other methods of study would be necessary in addition to intermediate filament profiles, such as CEA immunohistochemistry, mucin histochemistry, and ultrastructural study.\r"

Individuals with widely disseminated subependymal, bihemispheral, or brainstem involvement were excluded. After reoperation, patients with astrocytoma and anaplastic tumors have been observed for an average of 31 and 29 months, respectively.

The 14 surviving patients overall have a current average Karnofsky performance level of 95. The durability of surgically induced palliation alone, the safe limits of resectability, and the clinical features associated with a favorable surgical response have been examined.

The patients preoperatively manifested iron-resistant hypochromic microcytic anemia, and one of them had dysgammaglobulinemia and stunted growth. After the masses were removed, the blood picture of the patients normalized, and the adolescent with retarded somatic development resumed normal growth, but two patients developed local recurrence with identical histology and again became anemic. It appears that the peritumoral lymphoplasmacellular infiltrates, which in these instances may be regarded as reactive rather than primary cell proliferations, nevertheless brought about the type of systemic manifestations known as the Castleman syndrome, characteristically seen in patients with angiofollicular lymphoid hyperplasia (hamartoma) of soft tissues, or Castleman's tumor. In one of our patients the inflammatory infiltrate extended far into the surroundings of the meningioma, resulting in the erroneous initial diagnosis of \"encephalitis\" from a needle biopsy of the brain near the tumor.\r"

Among those for whom a progesterone receptor assay was available, a positive assay was associated with an increased risk of a contralateral primary (aOR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.0-9.5). AB blood type was also associated with an elevated risk, but this elevation was not statistically significant (aOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 0.7-7.7).

These persons were traced (with 93% success) approximately 10 years later by the NHANESI Epidemiologic Followup Survey, and incidence of malignancy in the interim period was determined. Primary allergy variables were physician-diagnosed asthma, hay fever, hives, food allergy, or other allergies. Excluded were persons with a prior history of cancer and cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer. After adjustment by logistic regression for age, sex, race, and smoking history, allergic history was found to increase the risk of subsequent malignancy (risk odds ratio = 1.40, 95% confidence interval = 1.10-1.77). The specific allergy type with the strongest cancer risk was hives. The cancer group with the strongest allergy association was lymphatic-hematopoietic (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma). The risk odds ratio of developing leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma for persons with hives history was 7.89 (95% CI = 3.13-19.89). These findings suggest that a history of allergy does not protect against subsequent cancer, and may be a risk factor. The possibility is raised that a history of hives may be a particular risk factor for lymphatic-hematopoietic malignancies.\r"

Metrizoate induced a marked elevation of LV end-diastolic pressure and LV systolic pressure and an increase in cardiac output after a delay of a few minutes. All these changes were significantly less severe with iohexol and metrizamide. Hypotension occurring 30 sec after LV angiography was observed only with use of metrizoate. All agents increased heart rate, but the increase after metrizoate was significantly more pronounced and prolonged. The PQ and QT interval was prolonged only by metrizoate. The subjective symptoms were significantly more marked with metrizoate than with the two other agents. Thus the new nonionic contrast agent iohexol and metrizamide produced markedly less hemodynamic and electrocardiographic disturbance than the ionic agent metrizoate.\r"

Coronary-artery cineangiograms were acquired with a power injector before intervention, 20 sec after intracoronary saline (control), and 20 sec after administration of papaverine into either the left (12 mg) or right (8 mg) coronary artery. Absolute coronary arterial diameter of a normal-appearing segment was quantified using a previously validated, fully automated digital edge detection program with an ADAC digital radiographic unit. Baseline coronary arterial diameter of 3.1 +/- 0.8 mm did not significantly change after saline administration (3.1 +/- 0.9 mm) but did significantly increase (p less than .001) to 3.4 +/- 0.9 mm after papaverine administration. No significant percent change in diameter occurred in either the left anterior descending (-.5 +/- 1.7%), left circumflex (-.2 +/- 1.1%), or right (-3.0 +/- 3.8%) coronary arteries with saline, but significant (p less than .001) increases occurred with papaverine (7.2 +/- 4.1%, 7.0 +/- 4.5%, 6.8 +/- 2.7%, respectively). The response of 7 coronary arteries examined immediately proximal to a significant lesion was not significantly different from the response of the remaining 11 coronary arteries. In conclusion, intracoronary papaverine causes a significant increase in coronary arterial diameter. This has clinical implications for assessing coronary flow reserve with devices that defect flow velocity.\r"

Inflations lasted 1.5 to 15 min and 23/27 stenoses were successfully dilated. The average reduction in stenosis was 67% (90%-33%).

Four patients required coronary artery bypass surgery in spite of PBI, but none suffered an infarction. Electrocardiograms were unchanged in 22 patients and showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes in four. Cardiac enzymes obtained in nine patients failed to reveal a significant increase in serum concentration. We conclude that PBI is well tolerated and can successfully dilate lesions not responding to short inflations.\r"

Monorail coronary angioplasty was attempted in 61 patients on 73 lesions with balloons from 2.0 to 3.7 mm. Angiographic success was obtained in 66 lesions (90%). For 15 lesions, balloon exchanges were needed. In three lesions, the Monorail balloon failed to cross the lesion, while a standard balloon succeeded; two lesions could not be crossed with any balloon. Vessel occlusion occurred in four patients: two had emergency surgery without infarct (one died suddenly 4 days later and one had a stroke 1 day later), one was recanalized with a standard balloon, and one had a myocardial infarct. Continuous infusion of urokinase was used until patient 3 in whom problems with the delivery system led to cardiocerebral air embolization (with complete recovery). No thrombotic complications were observed in the subsequent 58 patients with only a bolus of 10,000 U of heparin. The Monorail balloon facilitates contrast injections and balloon exchanges but appears more difficult to pass through tight lesions. Omission of the previously recommended infusion with a thrombolytic agent proved safe.\r"

This can be important in that inadvertent biopsy of the more delicate ventricular free wall may lead to perforation and pericardial tamponade. An alternate method of sheath placement is presented. This involves the use of a No. 5 or 6 French balloon-tipped catheter within the long bioptome sheath in order to facilitate sheath passage and positioning. Catheter positioning is readily accomplished when documented by bioplane fluoroscopy, with alternate or additional two-dimensional echocardiographic position check as desired. Balloon-guided positioning for right ventricular septal biopsy appears to be a simple and safe technique that may be especially useful for relatively inexperienced operators and for patients with abnormal cardiac anatomy for whom endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) might normally be technically difficult.\r"

Twenty minutes after dihydralazine administration mean arterial pressure (-20 per cent) and systemic vascular resistance (-50 per cent) decreased, and cardiac index (+57 per cent), heart rate (+37 per cent) and intrapulmonary shunt increased. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone and norepinephrine levels increased. Further decreases in mean arterial pressure and in systemic vascular resistance were observed when 0.5 MAC enflurane or isoflurane were added. With 1 MAC anaesthetic levels a further decrease in mean arterial pressure was observed in both groups, but pressure fell to a lower level with isoflurane than with enflurane (p less than 0.01). The reduction of arterial blood pressure to a level of 50-60 mmHg for three to four hours was easy to control and was free of complications. The preliminary IV administration of dihydralazine allowed a reduced volatile agent concentration which attenuated undesirable haemodynamic effects, in spite of renin and norepinephrine release, and permitted a rapid intraoperative awakening.\r"

A protocol for selective ordering of preoperative chest x-rays, according to the patient's clinical status, medical history and scheduled surgery, was developed and implemented in a teaching hospital in Paris. The utilization of the protocol during a one-year period was evaluated. Eleven hundred and one chest x-rays were ordered in 3866 patients (28 per cent). Five hundred and sixty-eight x-rays (52 per cent) were abnormal. One hundred and sixty-six (15 per cent) were considered useful by the anaesthetists, who took into account the entire hospital course, although only 51 (5 per cent) had an impact on the surgical plan or anaesthetic management. Among the 2765 patients who did not have a preoperative chest x-ray, two patients could have benefited from the chest x-ray, in the view of anaesthetists. Chart review for these two patients and for patients who had perioperative complications in the absence of a preoperative chest x-ray revealed that no complications could be linked to the lack of preoperative chest x-ray ordering. This study shows that the abandonment of routine ordering of preoperative chest x-rays does not produce adverse effects on patient care.\r"

Anaesthetists were asked to use a pulse oximeter in every case and trained to report Critical Incidents in order to determine if the oximeter can shorten the time to detection of these events. Four thousand seven hundred and ninety-seven anaesthetics were given during a four-month period in 1986-87. A Critical Incident was recorded when an unexpected physiologic deterioration requiring intervention by the anaesthetist to prevent a likely bad outcome was signalled first by the pulse oximeter. Critical Incidents were classified by patient characteristics, physiologic change, type of anaesthetic, and the type, length, and place of surgery. Reports were received in 65 per cent of cases, and a Critical Incident occurred in 191 (six per cent) of these. Desaturation was the commonest physiologic change (151) and was further classified as to severity (mild 85-94 per cent saturation, moderate 75-84 per cent, and severe 75 per cent). Desaturations during the maintenance phase of anaesthesia were milder but more frequent than those in the induction or emergence phases. There were no severe desaturations in elderly patients or those receiving regional anaesthesia. No group was free of Critical Incidents. Since undetected hypoxaemia may lead to disastrous complications we recommend that a pulse oximeter be used for every anaesthetic.\r"

Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABC) is most commonly utilized to assist in weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or to augment low-flow states following CPB. In-hospital survival following IAB insertion in these circumstances in patients with coronary artery disease is approximately 60 per cent. Patients with valvular disease have a lower in-hospital survival rate (50 per cent). Complications of IABC are usually of vascular or infectious origin. Balloon rupture is a rare though potentially lethal complication. The effects of balloon rupture may be compounded by the use of helium as a driving gas to inflate the balloon. Intra-aortic administration of protamine has not been shown to be superior to peripheral administration and should be avoided if an IAB is in place.\r"

Ultimate nonsurvivors of ICU admission (36 per cent) had shorter out-of-hospital times, shorter travel distances, and increased interventional support, as assessed by the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System applied over the telephone and prior to departure at the referring hospital. Significant interventions were undertaken by PATS in 23 per cent of the nondonor patients prior to departure. During the transport process, there was at least a seven per cent morbidity (arrhythmia, hypotension, and vehicular difficulties) and a 0.9 mortality rate. We conclude that PATS offered significant advantages to this patient population through its ability to maintain acceptable morbidity and mortality rates while transferring patients over long distances and for prolonged periods of time.\r"

  ".W": "A case is presented which describes the initiation of atrial-ventricular (A-V) sequential pacing using atrial epicardial wires and an in-situ transluminal ventricular pacing probe. A 68-year-old female with a permanent A-V sequential pacemaker was scheduled for elective aortocoronary bypass. Following sternotomy, pacing function was converted to ventricular pacing (VVI) with the use of electrocautery. A Chandler V-pacing probe was introduced through a Paceport (American Edwards) pulmonary artery catheter and with a paced increase in ventricular rate, the cardiac output increased from 2.8 to 3.2 L.min-1. At the conclusion of cardiopulmonary bypass the patient was in sinus rhythm at a rate of 67.min-1 and was paced to a faster rate using bipolar atrial epicardial wires. The patient subsequently developed intermittent heart block so temporary A-V sequential pacing was established using atrial epicardial wires and the in situ ventricular pacing probe. Pacing was achieved at routine generator output settings of seven milliamps (mA) for both atrium and ventricle and at an A-V interval of 0.120 sec. This resulted in an immediate increase in cardiac output from 3.3 to 4.1 L.min-1. The compatibility of these two pacing systems offers an increased margin of safety in cardiac surgery patients requiring atrial pacing, who are at risk for developing postoperative heart block.\r"

Since cardiac myocytes are terminally differentiated, they cannot divide except in the fetal period. To determine the role of cellular oncogenes in the growth of the heart, the expression pattern of eight cellular oncogenes during the developmental stage and pressure-overloaded hypertrophy of the rat hearts were examined in vivo. Northern blot analysis was performed with eight oncogene probes (myc, fos, Ha-ras, src, erbA, erbB, sis, myb). Pressure overload increased the levels of cellular (c-) fos, c-myc, and c-Ha-ras. An increase of c-fos and c-myc was detected at 30 minutes and 2 hours, respectively; the levels peaked at 8 hours, and they returned to baseline by 48 hours after aortic constriction. However, the level of c-Ha-ras showed a gradual increase. During the course of development, the expression of c-myc was detectable only in the embryonic stage, whereas the expression of c-fos was not detected in the fetal period, was increased after birth, and peaked in 200-day-old adults. The expression of c-Ha-ras was almost the same throughout the development. Cellular oncogenes were expressed in the heart in response to pressure overload and in a stage-specific manner. These results suggest that cellular oncogenes may participate in the normal developmental process and hypertrophy of hearts and that the cellular hypertrophy induced by pressure overload may share a similar mechanistic pathway with cell proliferation.\r"

Application of carbachol (300 mumol/l) to quin2-loaded myocytes bathed in 2 mmol/l Ca2+-containing solution caused [Ca2+]i to increase within 7-10 minutes from 182 +/- 9 to 212 +/- 11 nmol/l (n = 4). Carbachol acted via stimulation of muscarinic receptors because atropine (1 mumol/l) either prevented or abolished the increase in [Ca2+]i. Carbachol also produced a positive inotropic effect in rat papillary muscles contracting isometrically at a frequency of 0.5 Hz and enhanced contracture in resting preparations in the presence of high extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) (20 mmol/l). The effect of carbachol on [Ca2+]i was dependent on [Ca2+]o. In the presence of 10 mmol/l [Ca2+]o, the increase in [Ca2+]i was about two times that elicited by carbachol when bath [Ca2+]o was 2 mmol/l. Reduction of [Ca2+]o to 50 mumol/l abolished the carbachol effect but did not prevent caffeine-induced Ca2+ release. The carbachol-induced rise in [Ca2+]i remained unchanged in the presence of either 10 mmol/l caffeine or 1 mumol/l ryanodine. In the absence of extracellular Na+ concentration [( Na+]o), carbachol no longer produced an increase in [Ca2+]i of cardiomyocytes and failed to enhance Na+-withdrawal contracture of the rat papillary muscle. In contrast to the effect on [Ca2+]i, carbachol did not produce any change in pHi as determined from fluorescence signals obtained from rat ventricular myocytes loaded with 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Overloading in canine right atria was induced by artificial tricuspid valve regurgitation and pulmonary stenosis. Right atrial mean pressure rose to 15-20 mm Hg (n = 4) 2 months after surgery. In the working myocardium, cardiac overload caused redistribution of myosin isozymes, alpha-HC to beta-HC. Compared with the normal right atria, fewer myocytes were labeled with CMA19, but more were labeled with HMC14. However, the reactivity of sinus node cells with CMA19 and HMC14 was not changed between normal and overloaded right atria, indicating no redistribution of myosin heavy chain isozymes, alpha-HC to beta-HC. These results suggest that isozymes in myosin heavy chains in the specialized myocardium are protected from overload effects by their firm cytoskeletal framework or other mechanisms.\r"

The messenger RNA of regulatory isoform of ventricular MLC2, on the other hand, is found in threefold excess in atria of SHR relative to that of age-matched WKY. The increased level of MLC2 messenger RNA is present even in 6-week-old SHR atria where there is no established overloading of the heart. Thus, it appears that the increased expression of the regulatory MLC2 gene in SHR atrial cells is a predetermined event, which, most likely, participates in functional adaptation of the myocardium in response to pressure overload and subsequent hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial segments (less than 250 micron o.d.) excised from canine ileum were mounted in a chamber that permitted arterial transmural pressure (TMP) to be altered and measured. Subsequently, the periarterial nerves were field stimulated with single pulses (0.1 msec, 70 V), and the resting membrane potential (Em) as well as the nerve-mediated alterations in smooth muscle Em were measured using intracellular microelectrodes at TMPs between 0 and 160 mm Hg. The resting Em was greatest at TMPs of 40 mm Hg (-54.7 +/- 2.6 mV) and depolarized as the TMP was increased, reaching a value of -44.8 +/- 3.1 mV at 160 mm Hg. At TMP greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, a proportion of the preparations exhibited spontaneous electrical activity (SA) consisting of constant rhythmic oscillations in Em or action potentials (APs) or of trains of rhythmic APs that progressively decreased in amplitude, interrupted by periods of hyperpolarization. SA stopped when the TMP was lowered to 40 mm Hg and was reestablished when the TMP was reelevated to TMPs above 60 mm Hg. Nerve stimulation evoked excitatory junction potentials (ejps) or APs. At constant stimulus parameters, ejps of maximum amplitude having the greatest rate of potential rise and fall were produced at TMP of 100 mm Hg. At TMPs greater than 100 mm Hg or less than 100 mm Hg, the amplitude and the rate of rise and fall of the ejps decreased. Ejps formed in response to a constant single pulse stimulus (0.1 msec, 70 V) elicited APs only at TMPs greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Neither ejps nor APs were inhibited by alpha-receptor-blocking agents. These studies indicate that the TMP at which an artery is maintained plays an important role in determining the resting Em, the occurrence of spontaneous action potentials, and the alterations in Em associated with nerve stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the time course of efferent sympathetic denervation after transmural myocardial infarction (TMI) and of efferent vagal denervation after transmural or nontransmural myocardial infarction (NTMI), we measured effective refractory periods (ERP) basal and apical to TMI or NTMI in secobarbital-anesthetized, open-chest dogs. In eight dogs with latex-induced TMI, bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation shortened ERP at all 45 apical and basal test sites before latex injection. After latex injection, ERP shortening was unchanged at all 15 basal sites but was eliminated (less than or equal to 2 msec shortening) at three apical sites in 5-20 minutes and at 14 of 30 apical sites 30-180 minutes after latex injection. At the remaining 13 apical sites, ERP shortening was not eliminated but attenuated significantly in 5-180 minutes. ERP shortening induced by infused norepinephrine (0.20-0.25 microgram/kg/min) did not differ between basal and apical test sites 3-4 hours after latex injection; that is, no supersensitivity occurred. Of six dogs with TMI produced by ligation of multiple coronary arteries without latex injection, ERP shortening induced by efferent sympathetic neural stimulation was eliminated at 10 apical sites in four dogs over a period of 3 hours. At 14 apical sites that did not show denervation in these six dogs, ERP shortening was unchanged. In seven dogs with latex-induced TMI, bilateral vagal stimulation lengthened ERP at all 40 apical and basal test sites before latex injection. Vagally induced ERP lengthening was unchanged at all 13 basal sites after latex injection. ERP lengthening was eliminated (less than or equal to 1 msec lengthening) at four of 27 apical sites in 5-20 minutes and at 13 apical sites 30-180 minutes after latex injection. At the remaining 10 apical sites, ERP lengthening was not eliminated but decreased significantly 3 hours after latex injection. Of nine dogs with ligation-induced NTMI, five dogs showed elimination of vagally induced ERP lengthening at eight apical sites in 3 hours after ligation. ERP lengthening induced by vagal stimulation was unchanged at all 17 basal sites in nine dogs with NTMI. We conclude that TMI produced by latex injection and ligation of multiple coronary arteries produces heterogeneous loss of efferent sympathetic innervation in noninfarcted apical sites as early as 5-20 minutes after coronary occlusion with more complete denervation occurring over time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The chamber mechanical properties used in the simulation were defined in terms of a modified purely elastic behavior model with a flow-dependent resistive component. Computed results showed that at constant end-diastolic volume and constant ventricular perfusion pressure the mean pressure-mean flow relation was linear, except for changes in internal resistance where a cubic fit of points was more appropriate. In these conditions, parameter variations in the accepted linear relation produced changes in the slope and mean pressure axis intercept. Imposition of changes in experimental conditions gave rise to nonlinear mean pressure-mean flow relations. The results indicate that with elastic-resistive chamber mechanical properties as a starting point, the experimental conditions would be responsible for the different shapes of the mean pressure-mean flow relation obtained in isolated heart experiments. However, a more complete description of chamber properties (such as the addition of a deactivation component) could also give rise to nonlinear pump function graphs.\r"

Ischemia was induced by 30% and 45% reductions of circumflex arterial blood flow for successive 2-hour periods. A reperfusion period (1 hour and 45 minutes) followed ischemia upon deflation of a pneumatic occluder. Verapamil (30 micrograms/kg) was slowly injected into the circumflex artery as a bolus 15 minutes after each blood flow reduction step. To prevent verapamil-induced decreases in heart rate, ventricular pacing was established at 170 beats/min before a baseline period and maintained throughout the protocol. Creatine kinase activities (international units per milligram protein) measured in samples obtained from posterior papillary muscles were 15 +/- 1 (mean +/- SEM) and 10 +/- 2 for animals receiving verapamil or its saline vehicle, respectively (p less than 0.05). Quantitative morphometry was performed on left ventricular myocardium after staining with p-nitro blue tetrazolium. Intracoronary administration of verapamil reduced the extent of left ventricular infarction, as disclosed by positive tetrazolium staining of the tissue, from 34 +/- 4% of the left ventricle in vehicle-treated animals to 21 +/- 4% of the left ventricle in verapamil-treated animals (p less than 0.05). We conclude that intracoronary administration of verapamil reduced the extent of myocardial infarction acutely, independent of increases in blood flow through the circumflex coronary artery or decreases in heart rate. Administration of verapamil was not associated with decreases in ventricular afterload, the pressure-rate index, cardiac output, or the maximum rate of pressure development in the left ventricle. Verapamil treatment of animals subjected to ischemia was not associated with sustained elevations of left atrial pressure to values above those measured in animals receiving the vehicle.\r"

  ".W": "Anaphylactic events occurring in cardiac tissue can result in severe metabolic imbalances. The present study addresses the question of whether adenosine, produced in response to this stress, influences either the antigen-antibody-induced alterations in cardiac function or the release of histamine, which is known to be one of the important mediators of the anaphylactic reaction. Isolated hearts of passively sensitized guinea pigs were perfused at constant flow in a Langendorff preparation with physiological salt solution. Under control conditions, antigen challenge evoked a rapid transient release of histamine, an increase in coronary vascular resistance and beating rate, and an increase followed by a decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure. The antigen-induced transient increase in adenosine release from 0.26 +/- 0.07 to 4.66 +/- 0.48 nmol/min/g was associated with a 75 +/- 9% increase in the PR interval in all hearts and atrioventricular blocks in six of 17 hearts. Antigen challenge was also conducted in the presence of theophylline, 8-(4-sulfophenyl) theophylline (SP-T), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenosine hydrochloride (EHNA), or exogenous adenosine. The major findings were that 1) the antigen-induced prolongation of the PR interval was attenuated by the adenosine receptor blockers theophylline (to 23 +/- 6%) and SP-T (to 15 +/- 4%); 2) the incidence of antigen-induced atrioventricular blocks tended to be decreased by theophylline (to three of 10 hearts) and SP-T (to zero of seven hearts) and to be increased by the adenosine deaminase inhibitor, EHNA (to six of 10 hearts); 3) none of the interventions had major influences upon antigen-induced alterations in vascular resistance, atrial automaticity, or systolic pressure; and 4) EHNA and adenosine both significantly increased adenosine levels before anaphylaxis and also enhanced the total histamine release induced by antigen challenge from a control value of 2,321 +/- 244 ng/g to 3,424 +/- 307 ng/g and 4,298 +/- 616 ng/g, respectively. We conclude from our data that increases in levels of endogenous adenosine during cardiac anaphylaxis may contribute to the development of atrioventricular conduction delays and blocks and that increases in levels of adenosine before antigen challenge may increase the amount of histamine released during cardiac anaphylactic reactions.\r"

  ".W": "A novel type of cardiac myosin heavy chain, immunologically related to the myosin isoforms expressed during skeletal muscle development, has recently been described in sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal fibers of the adult bovine heart (Gorza et al, J Cell Biol 1986; 102:1758-1766). The tissue-specific expression of this myosin type has been utilized in the present study to investigate the differentiation of nodal fibers during cardiac development. In 4-6-week-old bovine embryos, reactivity for nodal myosin was observed in a cluster of cardiac fibers in the sinus venosus wall, corresponding to the sinoatrial node primordium and in a number of fibers localized in the left atrial wall, especially in proximity to vascular orifices, possibly corresponding to the postulated left-sided sinoatrial node. In contrast, reactivity for nodal myosin was not detected in the atrioventricular node until 12 weeks of gestation. Before this stage, fibers reactive for nodal myosin were also seen scattered in the left atrial wall and interatrial septum, raising the possibility that atrioventricular nodal fibers may derive from the left-sided sinoatrial node. Reactivity for nodal myosin was never seen in normal atrial and ventricular myocardium, nor in the ventricular conduction tissue, indicating that nodal myosin does not represent a primordial myosin form, but is rather a specific marker of a distinct muscle cell lineage.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the mechanism of ventricular vulnerability to electrical stimulation, we simultaneously recorded from 120 transmural electrodes in a 35 X 20 X 5-mm portion of right ventricular infundibulum in seven dogs. Baseline pacing (S1) was performed from outside the mapped region followed by single premature stimulation (S2) of increasing strength at the center of the mapped region. In five of six episodes of ventricular fibrillation and 26 of 30 episodes of repetitive responses, complete reentrant pathways were observed. Earliest activation following S2 was not at the site of S2 stimulation but was at a point between the S1 and S2 sites of stimulation. Activation spread away from the early site toward the opposite side of the mapped region around the sides of an arc of block near the S2 site to form a \"figure-of-eight.\" The activation fronts coalesced to activate the region around the S2 site last and, if the difference in times between activation at the early site and near the S2 site was large, reentered the tissue toward the S1 site. Ventricular refractory periods were determined in four dogs following S1 pacing; the regions with the greatest nonuniformity in the dispersion of refractoriness were not the regions of unidirectional block after S2 stimulation. Thus, 1) ventricular fibrillation and repetitive responses induced electrically with S1 and S2 stimuli at different ventricular sites arise by figure-of-eight reentry, 2) this reentry is caused by the ability of S2 stimulation both to prolong refractoriness near the S2 site and to initiate a propagated response in the region between the S1 and S2 sites, and 3) a nonuniform dispersion of refractoriness is not crucial for the electrical induction of reentry leading to ventricular fibrillation or repetitive responses when S1 and S2 stimuli are given at different locations on the right ventricular outflow tract.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure-volume (P-V) relations arise from a complex interplay of active decay of force (i.e., relaxation), passive elastic myocardial properties, and time-varying inflow across the mitral orifice. This study was designed to quantify the passive properties of the intact ventricle and the effects of elastic recoil by separating filling from relaxation with a method of LV volume clamping with a remote-controlled mitral valve. Eleven open-chest fentanyl-anesthetized dogs were instrumented with aortic and mitral flow probes, LV and left atrium micromanometers, and a remote-controlled mitral valve. We prevented complete (end-systolic volume clamping) or partial filling at different times in diastole. The ventricle thus relaxed completely at different volumes, and we generated P-V coordinates for the passive ventricle that included negative, as well as positive, values of pressure. We then estimated ventricular volumes from ventricular weight in eight dogs, using regression equations based on data in the literature, to determine the equilibrium volume (V0), that is, volume at zero transmural pressure, in the working ventricle. We abandoned the traditional exponential approach and characterized by the P-V relation with a logarithmic approach that included maximum LV volume (Vm), minimum volume (Vd), and stiffness parameters (Sp and Sn) for the positive (p) and negative (n) phases: Pp = -Sp In[(Vm - V)/(Vm - V0)] and Pn = Sn In[(V - Vd)/(V0 - Vd)]. With this formulation, the chamber compliance, dP/dV, is normalized by the LV operating volume, and Sp and Sn are size-independent chamber stiffness parameters with the units of stress. In eight ventricles with LV weight = 131 +/- 20 g, Vm = 116 +/- 18 ml, V0 = 37 +/- 6 ml, and Vd = 13 +/- 2 ml, stiffness Sp = 14.6 mm Hg and Sn = 5.1 mm Hg were determined from the slopes of the log-linearized equations. Also, the duration of LV relaxation is increased by the process of ventricular filling (161 +/- 31 msec, filling versus 108 +/- 36 msec, nonfilling, measured from dP/dtmin, p less than 0.0001). We conclude that volume clamping is a useful method of studying restoring forces and that the logarithmic approach is conceptually and quantitatively useful in characterizing the passive properties of the intact ventricle.\r"

  ".W": "Tension and intracellular free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) were measured in isolated ferret papillary muscles. When both anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation were prevented (metabolic blockade), there was a rapid decline of both developed tension and systolic [Ca2+]i signals. Subsequently, resting tension increased, and after a further delay, resting [Ca2+]i also rose. When oxidative metabolism was restarted after a period of metabolic blockade that was sufficient to elevate both resting tension and [Ca2+]i, a variable recovery of mechanical function occurred. In preparations that showed recovery, resting tension declined toward control level, and there was considerable recovery of developed tension. [Ca2+]i initially fell, but it then rose to a level similar to that at the end of the preceding period of metabolic blockade and exhibited large variations in amplitude with frequency components in the range 0.2-1 Hz. This elevated [Ca2+]i gradually declined. Arrhythmias were often present during this recovery period and appeared to be triggered by the spontaneous increases in [Ca2+]i. In preparations that failed to recover, resting tension remained elevated or increased, and developed tension showed little recovery. Such preparations showed larger rises in [Ca2+]i both during and after metabolic blockade, and [Ca2+]i continued to rise when oxidative metabolism was restarted. In experiments in which Na-Ca exchange was inhibited (by replacement of sodium by lithium or by the application of nickel), the rise of [Ca2+]i when oxidative metabolism was restarted was reduced, but recovery of mechanical function was improved. The correlation between elevated [Ca2+]i on reactivation of oxidative metabolism and failure of recovery of mechanical function suggests that elevated [Ca2+]i has a direct role in preventing the recovery of mechanical function.\r"

Perhaps because the balloon did not fully fill the left ventricle, there was a significant nonzero intercept in the relation between eigenvolume and balloon volume. Therefore, the results only partially confirmed the eigenvolume theory because eigenvolume should be proportional to cavity volume. This study compares eigenvolume with left ventricular volume measured by biplane angiography in intact beating hearts following hemodynamic interventions (atropine, phenylephrine, nitroprusside, volume loading, and propranolol). We performed 32 angiograms in five dogs. A high correlation (r = 0.958 +/- 0.029 [SD]) was found between eigenvolumes and left ventricular volumes. In contrast to earlier in vitro validations and consistent with theory, the intercept of the relation between eigenvolume and left ventricular cavity volume (angiovolume) was not significantly different from zero. These data strengthen the hypothesis that eigenvolume accurately reflects true left ventricular volume in vivo. These same data were used to assess the immediate (i.e., within a few beats) effect of angiography. Left ventricular volume loading associated with the angiogram modestly (6%) increases left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic eigenvolumes without changing stroke volume or pressures, consistent with a mild negative inotropic effect.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of different types of loading intervention on the resulting end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR) of the left ventricle in situ was investigated in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Left ventricular volume was measured by conductance catheter and pressure was measured by tip-micromanometer. Two loading interventions were applied: a pressure intervention (INp) by gradually occluding the descending aorta and a volume intervention (INv) by rapidly infusing 180 ml blood into the vena cava. The pressure-volume loops during an intervention always showed a linear ESPVR, the slope of which, Ees, was calculated. Possible method-related artifacts were assessed and could be excluded. Results from 16 dogs show that Ees(INp) was always larger (1.37 +/- 0.45 kPa/ml) than Ees(INv) (0.73 +/- 0.32 kPa/ml) (p less than 0.001). This difference was enhanced by beta-blockade through metoprolol. The same phenomenon was found for the slope (SdPV) of the relation between dP/dtmax and end-diastolic volume: SdPV(INp) = 45.17 +/- 22.63 kPa/ml/sec and SdPV(INv) = 20.55 +/- 11.13 kPa/ml/sec. In seven dogs, a right heart bypass was performed to study the influence of stroke volume on the ESPVR by applying a pressure intervention under three conditions: with constant end-diastolic volume (decreasing stroke volume), Ees = 2.27 +/- 0.79 kPa/ml; with constant stroke volume, Ees = 1.59 +/- 0.51 kPa/ml; and with increasing stroke volume (and increasing end-diastolic volume), Ees = 1.36 +/- 0.49 kPa/ml. Analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant relation between Ees and stroke volume (p less than 0.01). From the right heart bypass experiments, we conclude that shortening-related deactivation plays a role in the observed behavior of the ESPVR. However, the results from the series with intact circulation indicate that aortic occlusion has an additional effect on the slope of the ESPVR, leading to increased myocardial inotropism, perhaps mediated through a peripheral stimulus in response to decreased perfusion.\r"

When various layers of the vessel wall were separated by dissection or cell dispersion, angiotensinogen mRNA levels were greatest in the periaortic adipose tissue. Angiotensinogen mRNA was present in very small levels in the adventitia, with no detectable levels in the muscle layer. In addition to periaortic adipose tissue, angiotensinogen mRNA was also present in the interscapular brown fat pad of the rat. The high levels of angiotensinogen mRNA in periaortic brown adipose tissue suggests that angiotensin may be synthesized there and responses may exist in this tissue or adjacent sympathetic nerve terminals.\r"

  ".W": "Recovery of postischemic function may be limited by energy synthesis by mitochondria, energy transfer via the creatine kinase reaction, or energy utilization at myofibrils. To identify the limiting step, we defined the relations among oxygen consumption, creatine kinase reaction velocity and cardiac performance in myocardium reperfused following mild, moderate, and severe ischemia. Isolated isovolumic ferret hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 37 degrees C. After 30 minutes of control, hearts were made ischemic for 20, 40, or 60 minutes and reperfused for 40 minutes. During preischemia, cardiac performance (estimated as the rate-pressure product), was 14.8 x 10(3) mm Hg/min, oxygen consumption was 16.7 mumol/min/g dry weight, and creatine kinase reaction velocity measured by 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance saturation transfer was 12.7 mM/sec. For hearts reperfused after 20, 40, or 60 minutes of ischemia, rate-pressure product was 11.5, 6.5, and 1.1 x 10(3) mm Hg/min; oxygen consumption was 13.5, 14.2, and 6.9 mumol/min/g dry weight; and creatine kinase reaction velocity was 9.6, 5.0, and 2.0 mM/sec, respectively. Thus, with increasing severity of insult, creatine kinase reaction velocity decreased monotonically with performance (r = 0.99). Changes in creatine kinase reaction velocity were predicted from the creatine kinase rate equation (r = 0.99; predicted vs. measured velocity) and can therefore be explained by changes in substrate concentration. Oxygen consumption did not correlate with performance or creatine kinase velocity, consistent with abnormalities in mitochondrial energy production. In all cases, creatine kinase reaction velocity was an order of magnitude faster than the maximal rate of ATP synthesis estimated by oxygen consumption. We conclude that, in postischemic myocardium, creatine kinase reaction velocity decreases in proportion to performance, but high-energy phosphate transfer does not limit availability of high-energy phosphate for contraction.\r"

To delineate the distribution of beta-receptor subtypes in myocytic and vascular components of the heart, we incubated transmural sections of canine left ventricle with [125Iodo]cyanopindolol and selected concentrations of the beta 1-selective antagonist betaxolol or the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551. Detailed competition binding data were best accounted for by a two-site model in which approximately 75% of total sites were beta 1- and 25% were beta 2-receptors. The relative proportions of beta-receptor subtypes in myocytic and vascular components were assessed autoradiographically by analyzing the density of binding sites in transmural sections incubated with radioligand and subtype-selective displacers. Betaxolol (10(-7) M) reduced the density of radioligand binding sites by 44% in regions composed primarily of ventricular myocytes but by less than 5% in small coronary arterioles. ICI 118,551 (10(-7) M) reduced radioligand binding-site density by 18% in myocytic regions and by 55% in small arterioles. In myocytic regions, these data indicated a subtype composition of approximately 85% beta 1- and 15% beta 2-sites. In contrast, arterioles contained almost exclusively the beta 2-subtype. The diameters of coronary vessels in which beta 2-receptors were found to be selectively increased fell within a narrow range (mean +/- SD, 35 +/- 11 microns; range, 16-55 microns). Small mural arteries and venules did not contain a significantly higher proportion of beta 2-receptors than adjacent myocytic regions.\r"

To ascertain the pharmacological and hemodynamic mechanisms responsible for the elevation in LV filling pressure observed with dopamine, we administered incremental infusions (2, 4, and 6 micrograms/kg/min) of dopamine to 18 open-chest, anesthetized dogs in the presence and absence of rauwolscine (selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) (n = 7), terazosin (selective alpha 1-antagonist) (n = 6), and domperidone (selective dopamine2 antagonist) (n = 5), while measuring pressures in the LV and left atrium and changes in dimension in the LV short-axis (with ultrasonic piezo crystals). Dobutamine (2, 4, and 6 micrograms/kg/min) was infused in five additional dogs before and after administration of rauwolscine. The time constant of isovolumic pressure decay, peak lengthening rate (mm/sec), LV end-diastolic pressure, and diastolic pressure-dimension relation were computed. A significant elevation in LV end-diastolic pressure and a parallel increase in LV end-diastolic chamber size was observed with dopamine, while a decline in LV end-diastolic pressure occurred with dobutamine. Yet both dopamine and dobutamine caused a dose-related acceleration of pressure decay and augmentation of peak lengthening rate. Furthermore, heart rate declined during the administration of dopamine but rose with dobutamine. In the presence of either rauwolscine or terazosin, dopamine infusion resulted in a positive chronotropic effect and dose-dependent reductions in LV end-diastolic pressure and end-diastolic chamber dimension; arterial pressure fell only after terazosin administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In six open-chest dogs, simultaneous recordings were made from 120 transmural electrodes in 40 plunge electrodes within a 35 X 20 X 5-mm portion of the right ventricular outflow tract during epicardial and endocardial pacing at a strength of twice diastolic threshold and at 1 mA. The magnitude of extracellular potentials generated by the stimulus and the activation times were compared in regions proximal (less than 10-12 mm) and distal to the pacing site. Local fiber orientation was histologically determined at each recording electrode. For endocardial pacing, endocardial potentials were larger than epicardial potentials only in the proximal region (p less than 0.001); while in the distal region, epicardial potentials were larger (p less than 0.001), and endocardial activation occurred earlier than epicardial activation for both regions (p less than 0.001). For epicardial pacing, epicardial potentials were larger than endocardial potentials in both regions (p less than 0.001), and epicardial activation occurred earlier only in the proximal region (p less than 0.02), while endocardial activation occurred before epicardial activation in the distal region (p less than 0.01). In planes of recording electrodes parallel to the epicardium and endocardium, the initial isochrones were elliptical with the major axes of the ellipses along the mean fiber orientation between the pacing site and recording plane rather than along the local fiber orientation in the recording plane. Thus, the ellipses in each plane rotated with respect to each other so that in three dimensions the activation front was helicoid, yet the twist of the helix was less than that of the corresponding transmural rotation of fibers. For pacing from the right ventricular outflow tract, we conclude that beyond 10-12 mm from endocardial and epicardial pacing sites epicardial stimulus potentials in both cases are larger than endocardial potentials because of resistivity differences inside and outside the heart wall and activation in both cases is primarily endocardial to epicardial because of rapid endocardial conduction, and we conclude that the initial spread of activation is helicoid and determined by transmural fiber direction.\r"

  ".W": "It is not known how well potential gradient, current density, and energy correlate with excitation by extracellular stimulation in the in situ heart. Additionally, the influence of fiber orientation and stimulus polarity on the extracellular thresholds for stimulation expressed in terms of these factors has not been assessed. To answer these questions for myocardium in electrical diastole, extracellular excitation thresholds were determined from measurements of stimulus potentials and activation patterns recorded from 120 transmural electrodes in a 35 X 20 X 5-mm region of the right ventricular outflow tract in six open-chest dogs. Extracellular potential gradients, current densities, energies, and their components longitudinal and transverse to the local fiber orientation at each recording site were calculated from the stimulus potentials produced by 3-msec constant-current stimuli. The resulting values in regions directly excited by the stimulus field were compared with the values in regions not directly excited but activated by the spread of wavefronts conducting away from the directly excited region. Magnitudes of 3.66 mA/cm2 for current density, 9.7 microJ/cm3 for energy, and 804 mV/cm for potential gradient yielded minimum misclassifications of 8%, 13%, and 17%, respectively, of sites directly and not directly excited. A linear bivariate combination of the longitudinal (l) and transverse (t) components of the potential gradient yielded 7% misclassification (threshold ratio t/l of 2.88), and linear combination of corresponding current density components yielded 8% misclassification (threshold ratio t/l of 1.04). Anodal and cathodal thresholds were not significantly different (p = 0.39). Potential gradient, current density, and energy strength-duration curves were constructed for pulse durations (D) of 0.2-20 msec. The best fit hyperbolic curve for current density magnitude (Jm) was Jm = 3.97/D + 3.15, where Jm is in mA/cm2, and D is in msec. Thus, for stimulation during electrical diastole 1) both current density magnitude and longitudinal and transverse components of the potential gradient are closely correlated with excitation, 2) the extracellular potential gradient along cardiac cells has a lower threshold than across cells, while current density thresholds along and across cells are similar, 3) anodal and cathodal thresholds are approximately equal for stimuli greater than or equal to 5 mA, and 4) the extracellular potential gradient, current density, and energy excitation thresholds can be expressed by strength-duration equations.\r"

Using the microfluorometry of Ca2+-indicator dye quin2, relative changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration could be measured. In the presence of 1 mM extracellular Ca2+, both diltiazem (IC50, 0.31 microM) and verapamil (IC50, 0.47 microM) dose-dependently inhibited elevations in the cytosolic Ca2+, as induced by depolarization of the plasma membrane with high extracellular K+. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, caffeine and high extracellular K+ induced transient and dose-dependent elevations of the cytosolic Ca2+, and these elevations were not inhibited by either diltiazem or verapamil. Norepinephrine also induced a transient and dose-dependent elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. However, this elevation was inhibited by verapamil and diltiazem (when the norepinephrine concentration was 10(-5) M, IC50 for verapamil and diltiazem was 4.0 and 24.9 microM, respectively). Thus, while verapamil and diltiazem may have no direct effect on the release of Ca2+ from the depolarization- and the caffeine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ storage sites, the agents do seem to inhibit the adrenoceptor-mediated Ca2+ release mechanism in vascular smooth muscle cells.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of hemorrhage on renal nerve activity and of subsequent opiate receptor blockade with naloxone were studied in conscious rabbits. Mean arterial pressure remained constant at 77 +/- 2 mm Hg through 17 +/- 2 ml/kg hemorrhage, while renal nerve activity increased by 159 +/- 16%. After 25 +/- 1 ml/kg hemorrhage, mean arterial pressure fell by 42 +/- 3 mm Hg, and renal nerve activity decreased below the prehemorrhagic control level by 41 +/- 15%. Bolus injection of naloxone (3 mg/kg i.v.) increased mean arterial pressure to 79 +/- 2 mm Hg, not significantly different from the prehemorrhagic control level. Renal nerve activity increased by 171 +/- 28%, comparable to the peak increase during nonhypotensive hemorrhage. On a different day, hemorrhage was repeated, and phenylephrine was infused during the subsequent hypotension. Phenylephrine increased mean arterial pressure to the prehemorrhagic control level. With increasing mean arterial pressure, renal nerve activity increased from its level during hypotensive hemorrhage and recovered toward the prehemorrhagic control level (-26 +/- 11%), but it did not return to the peak value reached during nonhypotensive hemorrhage. To further examine the blocking effects of naloxone on changes in mean arterial pressure and renal nerve activity induced by exogenous opiate peptides, methionine-enkephalin was injected both in the control state and after treatment with naloxone. A bolus injection of methionine-enkephalin (10 micrograms/kg) decreased mean arterial pressure (-8.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg) and renal nerve activity (-95 +/- 1%). Pretreatment with naloxone (0.5 mg/kg) effectively blocked this depressor effect and reduction in renal nerve activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that physical conditioning in the rat improves cardiac mechanics and biochemistry and normalizes the cardiac contractile protein abnormalities associated with renovascular hypertension. Since chronic adrenergic stimulation with dobutamine simulates some aspects of physical conditioning, this study was undertaken to investigate the effects of chronic dobutamine administration on normal and hypertensive rat hearts. Four groups of female animals were studied: controls, dobutamine-treated (2 mg/kg twice daily), renovascular hypertensives, and dobutamine-treated hypertensives. Animals were killed after 8-10 weeks and cardiac histology, myosin biochemistry, and mechanics in an isolated heart perfusion apparatus were studied. Dobutamine, unlike hypertension, was not associated with histological evidence of myocardial damage but did increase cardiac mass by 10% and calcium-activated myosin ATPase activity by 13%. Hypertension was associated with a 24% increase in mass, a 24% decrease in ATPase activity, and a shift in the myosin isoenzyme pattern from V1 to V3. The combined stimuli caused additive hypertrophy (44%) and normalized myosin biochemistry and isomyosin distribution. Dobutamine treatment was not associated with significant improvements in pump or muscle function in control or hypertensive hearts. Thus chronic dobutamine treatment, like physical conditioning, induces a physiological cardiac hypertrophy in rats that is associated with improved myosin enzymology and normalization of the contractile protein abnormalities associated with hypertension. Unlike physical conditioning, however, these biochemical alterations do not result in improved contractile function as measured in an isolated buffer-perfused heart apparatus.\r"

  ".W": "Excitation in the epicardial border zone of 3-5-day-old canine infarcts was mapped with an array of 192 bipolar electrodes during sustained ventricular tachycardia. Reentrant circuits were found in which activation occurred around long lines of apparent conduction block based on the criterion that excitation on opposite sides of the lines occurred with marked disparity in time. When the lines of apparent block were functional (i.e., occurred only during tachycardia and not during sinus rhythm or ventricular pacing) they were oriented parallel to the long axis of epicardial muscle fiber bundles. Isochrones distal to the lines were oriented parallel to them because widely separate sites within these isochrones were activated nearly simultaneously. This suggested that excitation not only occurred around the lines of block but also slowly across them. This slow activation occurred transverse to the long axis of the myocardial fibers and therefore might result because of the anisotropic tissue properties. To test this hypothesis, the epicardial border zone was stimulated during sinus rhythm through electrodes around its margin and at the center of the recording array. Activation transverse to the myocardial fibers in regions where lines of block occurred during tachycardia was slow, whereas it was rapid parallel to fibers' orientation. During tachycardia electrograms along the lines of apparent block had long durations and were fractionated, a characteristic that can also result from activation transverse to the myocardial fiber long axis. Therefore, we propose that the parallel orientation of the muscle bundles in the epicardial border zone is an important cause of ventricular tachycardia because activation transverse to myocardial fibers is sufficiently slow to permit the occurrence of reentry.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium-independent noradrenaline release was studied in the isolated perfused rat heart under conditions of normoxia, cyanide intoxication, and ischemia. The release of endogenous noradrenaline and dihydroxyphenylglycol were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The release of dihydroxyphenylglycol, the main neuronal noradrenaline metabolite, was used as an indicator of the free axoplasmic amine concentration. When storage function of neuronal vesicles was disturbed by Ro 4-1284 or trimethyltin, high dihydroxyphenylglycol release was observed without concomitant overflow of noradrenaline. If, however, these agents were combined with inhibition of Na+K+-ATPase or with veratridine-induced entry of sodium into the neuron, both dihydroxyphenylglycol and noradrenaline were released. Noradrenaline release was independent of extracellular calcium and was suppressed by blockade of neuronal catecholamine uptake (uptake1), indicating nonexocytotic noradrenaline liberation from the sympathetic nerve ending. This release critically depended on two conditions: 1) increased cytoplasmic concentrations of noradrenaline within the sympathetic neuron and 2) intraneuronal sodium accumulation. Both conditions together were required to induce noradrenaline efflux across the plasma membrane using the uptake1 carrier in reverse of its normal transport direction. A disturbed energy status of the sympathetic neuron, induced by cyanide intoxication or ischemia, likewise caused calcium-independent noradrenaline release by interfering with both vesicular storage function and neuronal sodium homoeostatis. Again, release was sensitive to uptake1 blockade. Since neuronal sodium accumulation was the rate-limiting step, release was further accelerated when residual Na+,K+-ATPase activity was inhibited. Na+-H+ exchange was identified as the predominant pathway of sodium entry into the sympathetic nerve ending in ischemia, and its inhibition by amiloride and ethylisopropylamiloride markedly suppressed ischemia-induced noradrenaline release.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of hypertension and of therapy by converting enzyme inhibitor (S 9490-3, perindopril) on the function and structure of large arteries has been studied in two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats. After one month without treatment, clipped hypertensive rats (n = 24) and sham-operated rats (n = 24) were randomly allocated to treatment by S 9490, 1 mg/kg once a day (n = 24) or to placebo (n = 24) and pursued for 4 weeks. Hemodynamic parameters, including instantaneous pressure and aortic velocity measured by Doppler, were recorded under anesthesia at the end of the treatment period. Passive mechanical properties of carotid arteries were recorded in situ in the presence or the absence of smooth muscle cell activity (potassium cyanide poisoning). Morphological parameters of the aortic media, including medial thickness, nucleus density, and cross sectional area and relative density in proteins of interstitial matrix, were recorded by an automated morphometrical system. Hypertension was associated with an increase in characteristic impedance of the aorta and a decrease in compliance of the arterial system. Treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors completely reversed these in vivo markers of the rigidity of large arteries. Hypertension was associated with a shift of the passive pressure-volume relation in the carotid. Treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors normalized the carotid pressure-volume relation, whereas poisoning smooth muscle cells induced a disappearance of the curve differences between hypertensive and normotensive animals. Morphometric analysis of aortic walls permits us to report this functional change to structural modification of the arterial wall. Aortic media thickness was increased by hypertension; this phenomenon was reversed by treatment. Modification of aortic thickness was due to hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells with parallel modifications of absolute amount of collagen, whereas absolute amount of elastin did not change in this early phase of renovascular hypertension in young rats. Treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors reversed the thickness of aortic media without regression of the increase in absolute amount of collagen content whereas absolute amount of elastin content did not change.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the concentration of free intracellular adenosine in the heart the kinetic properties of cytosolic S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase were utilized at elevated levels of L-homocysteine (adenosine + L-homocysteine in equilibrium with SAH + H2O). Global hypoxia was induced in the isolated perfused guinea pig heart by graded reduction of perfusion medium PO2 in the presence of saturating concentrations of homocysteine (0.2-1.0 mM). Reduction of PO2 from 660 to 165 mm Hg increased the steady-state concentration of total tissue adenosine from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 2.8 +/- 0.2 nmoles/g, while the rate of SAH formation increased linearly from 0.22 +/- 0.03 to 2.50 +/- 0.13 nmoles/min/g. When adenosine was exogenously applied at a concentration of 100 microM together with homocysteine (1 mM), SAH accumulation rates were much greater: 23.34 +/- 3.31 and 42.11 +/- 1.73 nmoles/min/g with normoxic (95% O2) and hypoxic (30% O2) perfusion, respectively. The apparent Km and Vmax values for SAH-hydrolase in vivo were estimated to be 20 microM and 59 nmoles/min/g wet wt, respectively. Since the relation between SAH formation and adenosine in the physiological concentration range is linear, the measured rate of SAH accumulation during normoxia and hypoxia permitted the calculation of the free intracellular adenosine level, which was 0.061 nmoles/g (0.08 microM) in the normoxic heart. With hypoxia (PO2 165 mm Hg), this value increased to 1.57 nmoles/g (2.0 microM). Free intracellular adenosine closely correlated with the hypoxia-induced changes in coronary flow. The data reveal that measurement of the rate of SAH accumulation during homocysteine infusion can be used for sensitive assessment of free intracellular adenosine levels. Assuming that the intracellular adenosine concentration equals that in the interstitial space, the results furthermore indicate that the degree of intracellular adenosine formation during hypoxic perfusion is quantitatively sufficient to account for most of the observed increases in coronary flow.\r"

  ".W": "Rate of accumulation of myocardial S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) was used in an open-chest dog preparation as an index of free cytosolic adenosine levels. Following 30 minutes of coronary artery ligation and infusion of L-homocysteine thiolactone (10 mumol/kg/min i.v.) SAH levels increased from 1.3 (control) to 3.3 nmoles/g in the nonischemic and to values over 100 nmoles/g in the ischemic region. Compared with regional myocardial blood flow the enhanced rate of SAH accumulation was strictly confined to the ischemic area. As long as blood flow was 0.6-1.2 ml/min/g, SAH levels remained unchanged. However, they steeply increased when regional myocardial blood flow decreased below 60% of control. Tissue levels of adenine nucleotides, adenosine, and lactate were not significantly affected in the flow range of 0.4-0.6 ml/min/g but rate of SAH accumulation was enhanced by 400%. In the nonischemic myocardium, SAH accumulation was 60% higher in the subendocardium than in the subepicardium. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure from 110 to 60, 45, and 35 mm Hg was associated with an exponential increase in coronary venous adenosine release only when perfusion pressure was below 60 mm Hg. Transmural mapping of SAH revealed that at 110 mm Hg SAH was homogeneously distributed, while at a perfusion pressure of 60 mm Hg SAH accumulation was enhanced only in the subendocardial layers. Decreasing perfusion pressure further to 40 and 30 mm Hg not only enhanced subendocardial SAH levels to 120 and 170 nmoles/g, respectively, but also considerably steepened the transmural gradient of SAH. SAH-hydrolase exhibited a broad pH-optimum and its activity in different parts of ventricular myocardium was identical. Our findings provide evidence that 1) measurement of SAH accumulation is a sensitive metabolic index for the assessment of regional myocardial ischemia, 2) significant formation of SAH occurs only when regional myocardial blood flow is less than 0.6 ml/min/g, and 3) transmural SAH gradient, a measure of free cytosolic adenosine, and coronary venous adenosine release significantly increase only when the autoregulatory reserve is exhausted.\r"

Highly purified canine myocytic sarcolemmal membranes were pretreated with 10-800 microM of selected beta-blocking (propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol, atenolol, or sotalol) and class I (quinidine, lidocaine, procainamide, or diphenylhydantoin) antiarrhythmic agents at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes. Subsequently, a superoxide radical (derived from dihydroxyfumarate) driven, Fe3+-ADP catalyzed free radical generating system was added and incubated for up to 45 minutes. Lipid peroxidation of sarcolemma was determined by malondialdehyde formation. Pretreatment of the membranes with the five beta-blockers resulted in various degrees (20-95%) of inhibition of sarcolemmal peroxidation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. All the class I agents were less effective (less than 20% inhibition). The order of potency of the beta-blockers was propranolol greater than pindolol greater than metoprolol greater than atenolol greater than sotalol and appeared to relate to their degree of lipophilicity. Propranolol, the most potent agent, achieved half-maximal inhibition of peroxidation at about 100 microM and achieved significance (p less than 0.01) at 20 microM. At pH 6.0, the efficacy of pindolol, metoprolol, atenolol, and sotalol diminished by 30-50% compared to pH 7.2, but the potency of propranolol remained unchanged. Since increased free radical production may occur during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, the above findings suggest that the lipophilic beta-blockers may provide additional antiperoxidative protection of ischemic tissue.\r"

We hypothesized that this agent would prevent catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction in the ischemic brain. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was determined with 14C-iodoantipyrine, and the perfused microvascular bed was visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran. MCA occlusion did not alter systemic hemodynamic or blood gas parameters. CBF averaged 29 +/- 15 (mean +/- SD) ml/min/100 g in the MCA-ligated cortex and 49 +/- 18 in the other examined brain regions. Prazosin did not significantly alter these CBF values, averaging 26 +/- 14 and 48 +/- 10, respectively. There were no significant regional differences in total capillaries/mm2 in either group. The percent of the capillaries/mm2 perfused (51 +/- 6%) was similar in the two groups in all examined regions except the ischemic cortex. In the MCA-ligated cortex, 22 +/- 8% of the capillary volume was perfused in comparison with 49 +/- 8% in the prazosin-treated group. Prazosin-treated rats had an increased percentage of their microvasculature perfused despite a similarly reduced CBF. Prazosin appeared to reduce diffusion distances in the ischemic cortex. This might be due to its alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity.\r"

In cats in which anesthesia was induced with pentobarbital and maintained with alpha-chloralose, we studied the effects of PBN stimulation on cardiovascular afferent inputs to nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), the site of first central termination for cardiovascular afferent fibers. Electrical stimulation of PBN resulted in an initial excitation followed by prolonged inhibition of the spontaneous activity of NTS neurons activated by ipsilateral carotid sinus nerve (CSN) stimulation. In 53 units recorded extracellularly in and around NTS, the number of action potential responses to ipsilateral CSN stimulation was reduced 73 +/- 3% by a prior conditioning stimulus to PBN at an interval of 30-60 msec. CSN input to 10 units excited by selective baroreceptor stimulation was inhibited by the PBN conditioning stimulus, as were convergent inputs from contralateral CSN, vagus, and renal nerves. The inhibitory influence of the PBN stimulus lasted as long as 450 msec. We examined the mechanism for these phenomena in additional intracellular recording experiments. In 57 units, PBN stimulation evoked a long lasting (65-359 msec) membrane potential hyperpolarization. In 42 cells, the PBN evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) was preceded by an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). CSN and convergent inputs were inhibited when timed to occur during the PBN induced IPSP. Conversely, CSN and convergent afferent nerves inhibited PBN input to NTS neurons with no associated change in membrane potential (n = 9 of 14). These data demonstrate for the first time a potent modulatory influence of PBN on NTS neurons processing cardiovascular afferent input.\r"

The experimental results show 1) that penticainide exerted a pronounced use-dependent block not dependent on the duration of the depolarizing pulse, 2) that no block was observed in the absence of stimulation, even when the membrane was depolarized by conditioning prepulses, and 3) that recovery was slower the more negative the holding potential but could be accelerated by repeating the depolarizing pulse; there was not only use-dependent block but also use-dependent unblock.

  ".W": "We studied the effects of cardiac cooling by 7 +/- 2 degrees C (SD) from 36 degrees C on both contractility index (Emax) and the relation between O2 consumption per beat (VO2) and systolic pressure-volume area (PVA) of the left ventricle in the excised cross-circulated dog heart preparation. PVA represents the total mechanical energy generated by a contraction. The VO2-PVA relation divides measured VO2 into unloaded VO2 and excess VO2. The slope of the VO2-PVA relation represents inversely the efficiency of the contractile machinery to convert chemical energy from the excess VO2 to total mechanical energy. Cooling is known to decrease myosin ATPase activity (Q10 of 2-3), which in turn is expected to increase the chemomechanical efficiency of cross bridges. Therefore, we expected an increase in the efficiency and hence a decreased slope of the VO2-PVA relation with cooling. The cooling increased Emax by 46 +/- 13% and the time to Emax by 45 +/- 27%. Pacing rate was constant or had to be slightly decreased to avoid arrhythmias with cooling. We found that neither the slope of the VO2-PVA relation nor unloaded VO2 significantly (p greater than 0.05) changed with the cooling. This result contradicts the expected increase in the efficiency with cooling. We conclude that cardiac cooling by 7 degrees C from 36 degrees C does not increase the efficiency of the contractile machinery in excised cross-circulated dog left ventricle.\r"

  ".W": "An enzymatic procedure was used to obtain ventricular cells from adult rat and guinea pig hearts. Isolated pairs of cells were selected to study the action potential transfer from cell to cell and determine the resistance of the nexal membrane, rn. For this purpose, each cell of a cell pair was connected to a patch pipette so as to enable whole-cell, tight-seal recording. Normal impulse transmission was observed when rn ranged from 5-265 M omega. In these cases, the action potential in both cells occurred virtually simultaneously. An occasional failure in action potential transfer was seen in cell pairs whose rn had increased to 155-375 M omega. In these cases, the impulse transfer across the nexal membrane occurred with considerable delay. Impulse transfer was completely blocked once rn was larger than 780 M omega. Assuming a single connexon conductance of 100 pS, this would mean that more than 13 connexons are necessary to allow impulse transfer from cell to cell. Two single myocytes, gently pushed together, neither showed electrotonic interaction nor impulse transfer, thus rendering unlikely the possibility of an ephaptic signal transmission.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that depletion of glycogen prior to myocardial ischemia diminishes lactate buildup and improves functional recovery on reperfusion in the isolated rabbit heart. Cardiac glycogen was reduced either by substituting N2 for O2 in the perfusate or by perfusion with substrate-free solution, before the onset of ischemia. Hearts were subjected to either 30 minutes of normothermic (37 degrees C) or 60 minutes of hypothermic (4 degrees C) ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Function was assessed by measuring peak left ventricular pressure at end-diastolic pressures ranging from 0 to 20 mm Hg. N2 perfusion for 15 minutes lowered myocardial glycogen by 60% and decreased ATP and phosphocreatine (p less than 0.001). Glycogen depletion did not decrease lactate accumulation during ischemia, but it impaired recovery with reperfusion (-46%, p less than 0.05). N2 perfusion for 5 minutes also reduced glycogen by 60%, but energy-rich phosphates were not reduced and functional recovery was still impaired (-40%, p less than 0.05). Perfusion with substrate-free medium diminished glycogen by 33% (p less than 0.05). Although lactate accumulation was significantly reduced (-45%, p less than 0.05), recovery following reperfusion was not improved. The results suggest that preservation of glycogen stores, but not the prevention of lactate buildup during ischemia, is beneficial for the recovery of function with reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (HT-LVH) increase completed infarct size. Myocardial infarction progresses in a wavefront of myocardial necrosis from the subendocardium to the subepicardium. We tested two hypotheses: First, HT-LVH accelerates the wavefront of myocardial necrosis when compared with normotensive animals; and second, lowering of arterial pressure by infusing nitroprusside 1 hour after coronary artery occlusion exerts a salutary effect on infarct size. To test these hypotheses, systemic hypertension (mean aortic pressure = 141 +/- 3 mm Hg) and left ventricular hypertrophy (18% increase in left ventricular mass) were induced in dogs using a single-kidney, single-clip model. Seventeen adult mongrel dogs were used as controls. We measured mean aortic pressure, heart rate, left atrial pressure, and myocardial perfusion (microspheres) in several groups of normal and HT-LVH awake dogs. In two groups (normal and HT-LVH), 1 hour of circumflex coronary artery occlusion was followed by 4 hours of reperfusion. In two additional groups (normal and HT-LVH), 3 hours of circumflex coronary artery occlusion was followed by 90 minutes of reperfusion. In another group with HT-LVH, nitroprusside was infused to reduce mean arterial pressure to 100 mm Hg beginning 1 hour after occlusion and was continued for the duration of reperfusion period (HT-LVH + N). Infarct size was assessed using triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain and risk area was determined using postmortem barium angiography. Fifteen of 17 (88%) control animals survived coronary artery occlusion, whereas only 17 of 42 (40%) dogs with HT-LVH survived coronary occlusion (p less than 0.05). Infarct-to-risk ratios in the various layers of the left ventricular wall were determined for survivors in all groups. After 1 hour of coronary occlusion more than twice as much mid-wall and epicardium was infarcted in the HT-LVH group compared with the control group. After 3 hours of coronary occlusion significantly more endocardium, mid-wall, and epicardium was infarcted in the dogs with HT-LVH. In the nitroprusside-treated HT-LVH dogs, the infarct sizes were similar to control animals. From these data we conclude: 1) the rate of infarction is accelerated in animals with HT-LVH; 2) nitroprusside infused 1 hour after coronary artery occlusion and continued throughout the reperfusion period exerts beneficial effect on infarct size when compared with control animals; and 3) acute coronary artery occlusion in animals with HT-LVH is associated with significantly greater mortality when compared with control animals.\r"

  ".U": "88253737\r", 
  ".W": "The progressive prolongation of atrioventricular node (AVN) conduction time to a new steady-state value caused by sudden and maintained increases in atrial rate is the most common form of AV nodal accommodation. This study was undertaken to 1) characterize AV nodal accommodation in isolated perfused guinea pig hearts, 2) investigate the influence of potential modulators of this phenomenon such as acetylcholine and adenosine, and 3) determine the physiological significance of AV nodal accommodation on cardiac function. Beat-by-beat changes in AVN conduction time caused by single- or multiple-step increases in atrial pacing rate were measured during control conditions and in the presence of atropine (1 microM), propranolol (1 microM), and the adenosine antagonist BW-A1433 (1 microM). BW-A1433 was the only intervention that significantly reduced the cumulative and frequency-dependent prolongation of AVN conduction time but this was only observed at atrial cycle lengths less than or equal to 170 msec. In addition, BW-A1433 shortened the Wenckebach cycle length from 163 +/- 2 to 153 +/- 2 during normoxia and from 172 +/- 3 to 164 +/- 4 during mild hypoxia. In contrast, dipyridamole (1 microM), an adenosine uptake blocker, markedly accentuated the AVN conduction time prolongation, accentuated the AV block associated with fast atrial rates, and significantly increased the Wenckebach cycle length. These effects of dipyridamole were prevented and antagonized by BW-A1433 and adenosine deaminase. When O2 supply was limited and at the same time demand increased secondary to fast atrial pacing, the rate of adenosine release increased from a control of 125 +/- 27 to 580 +/- 54 pmol/min/g. This was accompanied by a significant prolongation in AVN conduction time that invariably progressed to AV block. Once AV block occurred, O2 consumption decreased, O2 supply-to-demand ratio improved and the rate of adenosine release dropped to 310 +/- 61 pmol/min/g. Reversal of the AV block with adenosine antagonists resulted in a decrease in O2 supply-to-demand ratio and a severalfold increase in the rate of adenosine release. In this feedback system, adenosine signals the imbalance between O2 supply and demand, causes AV block and, thus, reduces demand to compensate for the limited O2 supply. On the other hand, adenosine deaminase and antagonists act as \"error signals\" by attenuating the effect of adenosine, whereas dipyridamole enhances the \"gain\" of the system by potentiating the effects of adenosine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Severe mitral regurgitation requiring surgery is the most common life-threatening complication of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and is due to progressive myxomatous change in the valve. We identified all residents of New South Wales, Australia, who had mitral valve surgery for myxomatous valve disease during 1982 and, using these data and the adult population statistics from 1982, estimated the cumulative risk of valve surgery in patients with MVP. In 1982, 50 of the 5.36 million New South Wales residents required surgery for this complication of MVP. Of the 50, 36 were men and 14 were women, which was significantly different from the population sex distribution (p less than 0.02) for mean age +/- SD of 60 +/- 11 years (range, 26-78 years). Using our previously determined 4% prevalence of adult MVP in New South Wales, we estimated the number of male and female patients with MVP at risk for each 5-year age interval and calculated age-specific event rates. The results show that the cumulative risk is minimal below the age of 50 years but then rises steeply, particularly in men. The risks in men aged 50, 60, and 70 years (with 95% confidence intervals) were 1:202 (130-448), 1:53 (37-82), and 1:28 (22-41), respectively. In women, the risk was less than half that in men (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ability of a computer-based image digitizing system to differentiate \"active\" from \"chronic\" valvular vegetations was evaluated. Twenty-two patients with newly diagnosed infective endocarditis were studied prospectively by serial two-dimensional echocardiograms. Two comparable images (active and chronic) from the same patient taken several weeks apart (range, 4-17 weeks) after initiation of therapy were obtained at end diastole with identical gain settings. The images were digitized, magnified, and displayed on a high-resolution color monitor. The mean pixel intensity of the valvular vegetation in the active stage was 20.6 +/- 3.6 (mean +/- SD), which increased to 34.4 +/- 4.3 in the chronic stage (p less than 0.01). Because there was some overlap of values, an additional standardization procedure was used in the last eight patients. In these eight patients, the mean pixel intensity of the vegetations in the active stage was 17.5 +/- 1.1, and it increased at 4 weeks to 25.0 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.05) and further increased in the chronic stage to 33.6 +/- 3.1 (p less than 0.05). There was no overlap of values between the active and chronic stages. Three clinical states are of particular interest: 1) The mean pixel intensity of the vegetations remained unchanged (23 vs. 24) in one patient who did not respond to antibiotic therapy. 2) The mean pixel intensity of the vegetations fell from 35 to 24 when one patient developed reinfection of the same valve, and with treatment, mean pixel intensity once again increased to 34. 3) The mean pixel intensity of the vegetations in five patients with culture negative infective endocarditis was low (21.6 +/- 1.9) and increased (33.6 +/- 6.0, p less than 0.05) during the chronic stage. The mean vegetation size was 0.73 +/- 0.30 cm2 in the active stage and decreased to 0.56 +/- 0.24 cm2 (p less than 0.05) in the chronic stage; however, in six of 22 patients (27%), vegetation size did not decrease with clinical cure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study included 35 patients who underwent the switch operation after banding and anastomosis; two died shortly after surgery, and one died of tachycardia 31 days after the operation. The left-to-right ventricular pressure ratio was above 0.83 in all surviving patients, 0.68 and 0.63 in the two operative deaths, and 0.84 in the other death. In the 32 surviving patients, angiographically determined left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction averaged 147 +/- 46(SD)% of normal and 0.64 +/- 0.12, respectively. We also measured LV mass using angiographic LV semiaxes and end-diastolic LV posterior wall thickness obtained from an echocardiogram. These variables of the patients who died were not different from those of the surviving patients. The wall thickness was greater than 4 mm in the surviving patients, while it was 3.5 mm in the two patients who died early and 5 mm in the patient who died later. From the semiaxes, the wall thickness, and aortic diastolic pressure, all of which were obtained before the anatomic repair, we calculated the predictive LV wall stress. This wall stress would indicate the LV wall stress at the time of aortic valve opening immediately after the arterial switch operation. Predictive wall stress was less than 120 x 10(3) dynes/cm2 in all but one of the surviving patients, whereas it was 151, 153, and 186 x 10(3) dynes/cm2 in the three patients who died.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In patients evaluated early after surgery, body surface area-adjusted left ventricular dimensions were smaller, and wall thickness was increased compared with controls. Ventricular performance (fractional shortening) was normal in most patients but was abnormally low in 10%. Nevertheless, contractility was normal or augmented in all subjects, with a mean value higher than the control group. The reduction in systolic function was related to altered loading conditions with a combination of reduced afterload and preload combined with augmented contractility. These altered myocardial mechanics appeared to be secondary to routine therapy with digitalis and diuretics. Diastolic function was also normal with differences in the rate of peak filling and rate of wall thinning entirely attributable to differences in ventricular size and function, and normalized indexes of diastolic function were not different between patients and controls. Patients evaluated late after repair were found to have normal regional wall motion with no evidence to suggest regional dysfunction as might be seen with regional ischemia. Ventricular size, wall thickness, systolic function, afterload, preload, contractility, and early diastolic function were indistinguishable from control values. Indexes of diastolic function demonstrated the same relation to age, body surface area, and ventricular size and function in both patients and controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Conventional echocardiographic-gated MRI was first performed in axial and rotated sagittal views and was used to identify the slice locations for cine MRI. Cine MRI was performed by gradient-recalled acquisition in steady state with a 30 degree flip angle, 12-msec echo time, 22-msec pulse repetition time, and a 128 x 256 acquisition matrix. Coarctation anatomy was extremely well defined in all but one patient who had vascular clips at the coarctation repair site. The smallest descending aortic flow diameter on cine MRI showed excellent agreement with angiography (r = 0.90). Lucent jets of high-velocity flow through the site of coarctation were imaged in eight patients, and jet length correlated well with the angiographic severity of coarctation (r = -0.81). Two patients were restudied after surgery, and they exhibited excellent repair and normal flow patterns. Cine MRI provides high-resolution imaging of coarctation anatomy with a dynamic spatial and temporal visualization of flow and with excellent detail of vascular anatomy and flow both proximal and distal to the coarctation.\r"

We evaluated the ability of two-dimensional echocardiography to define noninvasively the coronary artery anatomy in 37 consecutive patients (age range, 1 day to 18 years; mean age, 40.9 months). The origin and distribution of the right anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries, as well as any anteriorly coursing vessel, were examined from parasternal views. Complete studies were obtained in 29 (78%) of the 37 patients. Coronary artery anatomy was determined to be normal by echocardiography in 20 (69%) of the 29 patients. An anterior vessel across the right ventricular outflow tract was detected in the remaining nine patients. Six patients had an anterior descending artery from the left main coronary artery (paired anterior descending arteries in three patients, a right anterior descending artery from the left main coronary artery in two patients, and a right coronary-to-pulmonary artery fistula in one patient). Three patients had no anterior descending artery from the left main coronary artery (anterior descending artery from the right main coronary artery in two patients, and anterior descending and circumflex arteries from the right main coronary artery in one patient). Angiography, surgery, or autopsy confirmed the diagnoses in all but the final patient in whom the anterior descending artery arose from the right main coronary artery as observed at surgery, but the circumflex artery was not seen. Accurate evaluation of coronary artery anatomy is possible by echocardiography in the majority of patients with tetralogy of Fallot. Noninvasive identification of a major coronary artery coursing anteriorly can influence the timing of cardiac catheterization and surgery and the need for angiography.\r"

  ".W": "Assessment of the functional significance of coronary artery lesions during cardiac catheterization has recently become possible by calculating coronary flow reserve from both myocardial contrast appearance time and density in the resting and hyperemic states determined from digitized coronary cineangiograms. However, the interobserver and intraobserver variabilities, as well as the short-, medium-, and long-term variabilities of the coronary flow reserve measurements, have to be established before this technique becomes an acceptable means of assessing the immediate and long-term functional results of revascularization procedures such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Variability was defined as the mean difference and standard deviation of the difference between duplicate determinations of coronary flow reserve. The intraobserver variability (mean difference +/- SD) in the measurement of coronary flow reserve was -0.01 +/- 0.07. Interobserver variability by two observers was +0.08 +/- 0.52. Short-term variability based on the analysis of two coronary cineangiograms taken 5 minutes apart was -0.02 +/- 0.26. Medium-term variability (coronary cineangiographies repeated 1-3 hours apart) was found to be -0.06 +/- 0.52. Long-term variability (coronary cineangiographies repeated 3-5 months apart) was 0.11 +/- 0.63. Having established the reproducibility of this radiographic method, we studied the prospective changes in coronary flow reserve in 25 patients undergoing PTCA for single vessel coronary artery disease. Coronary flow reserve measurements and quantitative coronary cineangiography were performed before, immediately after, and 3-5 months after PTCA. PTCA resulted in an immediate increase in coronary flow reserve from 1 +/- 0.3 to 2.3 +/- 0.6 with a concomitant increase in obstruction area from 0.9 +/- 0.3 to 3.3 +/- 0.7 mm2. Nine of the 25 patients developed restenosis defined as a diameter stenosis greater than 50% at follow-up. The other 16 patients had a coronary flow reserve of 3.3 +/- 0.6, which was measured 3-5 months after PTCA. Coronary flow reserve measurement from digitized coronary cineangiograms is a reproducible method for the assessment of the physiological importance of coronary artery obstructions. Short-, medium-, and long-term investigations of the functional results of interventions such as pharmacological therapy or revascularization can be performed reliably with this technique.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the mechanism of regional hemostasis in the left ventricular (LV) cavity during myocardial infarction, the blood pathway in LV cavity was examined with contrast echocardiography injected from the left atrium before and after coronary ligation in nine canines. Before coronary ligation, contrast echoes spread over LV cavity with one rush. After ligation, smokelike echoes indicating hemostasis were observed at the apical middle of the LV cavity in five dogs with apical akinesis and at the apical area in four dogs with apical dyskinesis. The contrast echoes did not reach the apex within one diastolic period but turned upward to the outflow tract in the middle of the cavity in all dogs. In the cardiac beats that followed, some contrast echoes spread slowly toward the apex, forming a thin layer along the posterior wall in cases with akinesis but not in cases with dyskinesis. The area separated from the blood pathway developed where the smokelike echoes had been developed. Tachycardia exaggerated the abnormality of blood pathway and widened the contrast echo-free area. The abnormal pathway of the blood in apical myocardial infarction develops hemostasis in the apex. This should be one of the mechanisms of thrombus formation in myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Ethanol produces in vitro vasoconstriction of coronary arteries and can precipitate angina in patients with coronary obstructive disease. To demonstrate the in vivo effect of ethanol on coronary dynamics, baseline measurements of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery dimension by quantitative angiography, hemodynamics, arterial and coronary sinus blood gases, and blood ethanol levels were obtained in 14 closed-chest mongrel dogs. Three ethanol levels were established by intravenous bolus followed by 1-hour maintenance infusions. All measurements made at baseline were recorded every 30 minutes. Phentolamine (5 mg i.v.) and nicardipine (0.15 mg/kg i.v.) were given to evaluate constrictor mechanisms. Blood ethanol levels achieved at 60, 120, and 180 minutes were 649 +/- 48, 1,285 +/- 81, and 2,546 +/- 130 micrograms/ml, respectively. LAD cross-sectional area was reduced significantly from control at the end of each of the three dosing periods (-24 +/- 5%, -40 +/- 3%, and -53 +/- 3%; p less than 0.004). alpha-Adrenergic blockade had no effect on LAD cross-sectional area, while nicardipine partially reversed the ethanol-induced vasoconstriction. No significant change in vessel cross-sectional area took place in control dogs. These data suggest that ethanol induces epicardial coronary artery vasoconstriction in dogs at clinically important blood levels. alpha-Adrenergic blockade does not alter or reverse ethanol-induced vasoconstriction, while calcium channel blockade appears to be an effective vasodilator of ethanol-constricted vessels.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) and cardiac surface QRST area distributions was studied in eight pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Unipolar epicardial electrograms were recorded from 64 sites evenly distributed on the right and left ventricles. Localized areas of short repolarization properties were produced by directing five intensities of light onto the surface of the anterior right ventricle through apertures of three sizes. VFT, measured at the center of the lesion, decreased during warming and had a high negative correlation to the change (warming-control) in QRST area (delta QRST1) in the electrogram recorded from the center of the lesion. This correlation was independent of lesion size. For the six experiments, the correlation coefficients for 400-, 800-, and 1,600-mm2 lesions averaged -0.95, -0.94, and -0.96, respectively. The correlation between VFT and delta QRST1 without regard to lesion size averaged -0.88. VFT also had a negative correlation to root mean square (RMS)delta QRST because of warming. RMS delta QRST was calculated from the change in QRST areas (warming-control) in all 64 electrograms. The correlation between VFT and RMS delta QRST was dependent on lesion size. For all experiments, the correlation between VFT and RMS delta QRST averaged -0.97, -0.93, and -0.93 for 400-, 800-, and 1,600-mm2 lesions, respectively. The correlation between VFT and RMS delta QRST without regard to lesion size, however, was considerably lower, -0.59. The results of this study provide the first direct evidence that VFT is correlated with cardiac surface QRST area distributions.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of cardiac sympathetic nerves is recognized as a triggering factor for cardiac arrhythmias. However, the mechanisms involved have only been speculated. Because evidence from studies in vitro has established a relation between catecholamines, delayed afterdepolarizations (DAD), and triggered rhythms, it seemed possible that in vivo adrenergic activation also might lead to the development of DAD. Because very little evidence was available for DAD in vivo, we have evaluated whether monophasic action potential (MAP) recording with a contact electrode could be a suitable technique for the detection of DAD from the endocardium of anesthetized cats. In six animals, atrial pacing and graded aortic constriction were performed during MAP recording to assess MAP stability during hemodynamic changes, and in no cases were modifications of the baseline observed. In 11 cats, calcium gluconate (0.5 g) and G-strophanthin (100 micrograms) were administered. Action potential duration at 50% (APD50) and 90% (APD90) repolarization were reduced (from 138 +/- 16 to 122 +/- 18 msec, p less than 0.02, and from 163 +/- 23 to 149 +/- 20 msec, p less than 0.025, respectively). In eight of 11 (73%) animals, DAD were elicited with a mean amplitude of 1.2 +/- 0.4 mV. In 14 cats, the left stellate ganglion was stimulated for 45 seconds. APD50 and APD90 decreased (from 153 +/- 15 to 145 +/- 16 msec, p less than 0.005, and from 176 +/- 18 to 165 +/- 13 msec, p less than 0.001, respectively). DAD were induced in 10 of 14 animals (71%) with a mean amplitude of 1.2 +/- 0.3 mV. These results show that DAD can be induced in vivo by administration of calcium and digitalis and by activation of the cardiac sympathetic nerves. This latter finding further strengthens the existing link between adrenergic activation and ventricular arrhythmogenesis and suggests triggered activity as a likely mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Infarct expansion is acute regional dilatation and thinning of the infarct zone. There are several possibilities for the mechanism of this alteration in cardiac shape: thinning could be caused by 1) cell rupture, 2) a reduction in the intercellular space, or 3) stretching of myocytes or 4) slippage of groups of myocytes so that less cells are distributed across the wall. To determine the relative contributions of these cellular mechanisms of wall thinning and dilatation, detailed study of transverse histological sections of rat hearts with infarct expansion was performed 1, 2, and 3 days after coronary ligation. The number of cells across the wall was determined in six regions within, adjacent to, and remote from the infarct. Cell counting was performed so that the total number of cells across the wall and the number of cells per unit length (cell density) across the wall were determined. The transmural cell count and the cell density were correlated with the wall thickness in each region. Myocyte cross-sectional areas and sarcomere lengths were also measured. The results from the infarct expansion hearts were compared with those of sham-operated control hearts that had been similarly analyzed. To ensure that mechanisms identified in the rat were applicable to human infarct expansion, five hearts from patients who died within 3 days of infarction and two hearts from patients without coronary disease were studied histologically in a similar fashion. Wall thinning occurred in all regions of the rat infarct expansion hearts compared with controls (p less than 0.0001) but, as expected, was most pronounced in the infarct zone. A decrease in the number of cells across the wall accompanied the wall thinning at each site (p less than 0.0001), and this change in cell number was highly correlated with the changes in wall thickness (r = 0.915, p less than 0.001). Cell density increased from controls only within the infarct zone (p less than 0.001) and accounted for at most 20% of the thinning in that region. The change in cell density was attributable to both cell stretch (measured by increased sarcomere length and decreased myocyte cross-sectional area) and a decrease in the intercellular space. A similar strong correlation between wall thinning and decreased number of cells across the wall was identified in the human hearts (r = 0.94, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Glutathione peroxidase is an important enzyme in the degradative cascade of reactive oxygen free radicals. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a low molecular weight compound that has been used clinically to replenish glutathione. To assess the role of the glutathione redox pathway on reperfusion injury, 23 animals underwent 90 minutes of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 24 hours of reperfusion with the administration of NAC (n = 11) or saline (n = 12) beginning 30 minutes into occlusion and continuing for 3 hours after reperfusion. Regional ventricular function was measured with contrast ventriculography, and regional myocardial blood flow was determined with microspheres. At 24 hours, the area at risk was defined in vivo with Monastral Blue, and the area of necrosis was defined by incubation in triphenyltetrazolium. Biopsies were taken from the ischemic and nonischemic zones to determine levels of total glutathione, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity, and reactivity to thiobarbituric acid, an index of lipid peroxidation. The rate-pressure product and myocardial blood flow were similar in the two groups throughout the study. No significant differences were noted in infarct size expressed as a percentage of the area at risk (28.6 +/- 5.3% vs. 36.6 +/- 6.0%) and of the total left ventricle (14.4 +/- 3.2% vs. 16.5 +/- 3.1%), and no differences were noted between the two groups on examination of the ischemic subendocardium by light and electron microscopy. Both groups exhibited similar degrees of dyskinesis during occlusion; however, treated animals showed significant improvement in regional radial shortening at 3 hours (3.4 +/- 2.4% vs. -2.4 +/- 2.1%, p less than 0.02) and 24 hours (9.2 +/- 2.2% vs. -2.5 +/- 6.3%, p less than 0.001) after reperfusion. No differences were present in total glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactivity, or superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity in the ischemic zones of the two groups. This study suggests that N-acetylcysteine treatment before reperfusion may reduce myocardial stunning but does not limit myocyte death after reperfusion.\r"

Endocardial catheter electrodes were placed at the right ventricular apex under general anesthesia at least 2 weeks after infarction, and the dogs were allowed to recover for 24 hours before undergoing programmed stimulation in the conscious state on two occasions 2 hours apart. A protocol of programmed stimulation with up to seven ventricular extrastimuli was used. In 15 animals, ventricular tachycardia was inducible on both occasions with 3.4 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SEM; range, 1-5) extrastimuli. Two hours after baseline conscious induction, the dogs were anesthetized with either halothane, pentobarbital, or a fixed combination of fentanyl-droperidol plus nitrous oxide. Halothane prolonged the PR interval from 99 +/- 4 to 117 +/- 6 msec (p = 0.001) and the ventricular effective refractory period from 140 +/- 4 to 157 +/- 6 msec (p = 0.008). The ability to induce ventricular tachycardia was abolished in five of 10 animals (p less than 0.05). In the animals that remained inducible, the cycle length of tachycardia increased from 153 +/- 10 to 168 +/- 10 msec (p = 0.015), while the number of extrastimuli required was unaltered. Pentobarbital prolonged the PR interval from 104 +/- 6 to 124 +/- 6 msec (p = 0.004) and the QTc interval from 270 +/- 10 to 310 +/- 6 msec (p = 0.006). Ventricular tachycardia remained inducible in only six of 10 dogs (p less than 0.05) with no change in cycle length or the number of extrastimuli required. Ventricular fibrillation was inducible in an additional three dogs with a number of extrastimuli similar to that required to induce ventricular tachycardia before anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tiapamil increased blood flow in the peripheral ischemic zone (24 +/- 3.2% vs. 16.9 +/- 1.6% of preligation value in controls, p less than 0.05) as well as in the peri-ischemic and nonischemic zones (153.9 +/- 12.7% and 186.3 +/- 17.1%, respectively; both p less than 0.0001 vs. 97.9 +/- 5% and 91.3 +/- 4.7% in controls).

Verapamil did not change blood flow in the peripheral, peri-ischemic, or nonischemic zones. Thus, tiapamil, and not verapamil, decreased ischemic ventricular fibrillation while maintaining left ventricular mechanical function.

Subjects rode stationary bicycles 1 hour daily, 5 days each week for 14 weeks (n = 8), and 4 days each week thereafter for a total of 32-48 weeks (n = 7) of training. HDL metabolism was assessed with 125I-radiolabeled autologous HDL while subjects consumed defined diets. Maximal oxygen uptake increased 26 +/- 7% (p less than 0.001) after 14 weeks but did not increase further with more prolonged training. Body weight and estimated body fat did not change. HDL cholesterol increased 5 +/- 3 mg/dl, and triglycerides decreased 19 +/- 23 mg/dl after 14 weeks (p less than 0.025 for both), but there were no additional changes with continued training. Postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase activity was 22% higher than baseline activity after both 14 (p less than 0.025) and 32 or more weeks of exercise. In contrast, hepatic triglyceride lipase activity was 16 +/- 8% and 15 +/- 8% lower than baseline at each measurement (p less than 0.005 for both). The disappearance rate of triglycerides after an intravenously administered fat solution was 24 +/- 24% higher at 14 weeks and 49 +/- 18% (p less than 0.005) higher after more prolonged training. Total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I and A-II concentrations at the end of study were not different from initial values. Plasma volume was 8% above initial values at both post-training measurements. The biological half-life of apolipoprotein A-I was unchanged at 14 weeks but was 10 +/- 13% longer (p = 0.07) and increased in all but one subject at the end of the study. Half-life for apolipoprotein A-II was 8 +/- 8% (p = 0.031) and 11 +/- 14% (p = 0.06) above baseline at 14 and 32 or more weeks, respectively. The synthetic rates for apolipoproteins A-I and A-II were not different from baseline values at 32-48 weeks. We conclude that 8-11 months of exercise training in previously sedentary men enhances fat tolerance and increases HDL cholesterol concentrations by prolonging HDL survival. The changes in HDL apolipoprotein survival, however, do not approximate the differences previously noted between elite endurance athletes and sedentary men. Changes in HDL cholesterol concentration were not large and suggest that the potential for exercise-related changes in HDL may be modest in many subjects.\r"

In untreated patients, cardiac removal of radioactive norepinephrine averaged 79%, whereas in desipramine-treated patients, cardiac removal of radioactive norepinephrine averaged 19%, a value similar to that of isoproterenol in untreated patients (14%), confirming that in the heart the non-neuronal removals of isoproterenol and norepinephrine were similar. In the heart, 69% of delivered norepinephrine was estimated to be removed by Uptake-1, a much higher percentage than that in the arm (14%), leg (7%), brain (10%), and lungs (4%). The cardiac arteriovenous increment in endogenous DHPG (137%) far exceeded that of the other beds (49%, 26%, 39%, and -19%, respectively), and radioactive DHPG in the great cardiac vein exceeded arterial levels by 113%, whereas in the other beds, arterial radioactive DHPG exceeded venous levels. The results indicate that the human heart is exceptionally dependent on neuronal uptake for in vivo removal of circulating norepinephrine.\r"

  ".W": "Although previous studies in both animals and humans have suggested that cardiac baroreceptors modulate reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction during exercise, more recent studies in conscious animals have not supported this view. To further test this concept in humans, we measured sympathetic nerve discharge with intraneural microelectrodes while we used static handgrip to activate the exercise pressor reflex and nonhypotensive lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) to selectively unload the cardiac baroreflex. In nine healthy subjects, we measured blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) from the peroneal nerve (resting leg) during 2 minutes of static handgrip at 20% and 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) alone and in combination with LBNP at -5 mm Hg. Handgrip alone (exercise reflex) at 20% and 30% MVC caused graded increases in MSNA. LBNP alone (cardiac reflex) did not alter blood pressure or heart rate but decreased central venous pressure by 2.5 +/- 0.1 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05) and increased MSNA by 92 +/- 22% over the control value. Most important, handgrip performed during LBNP (interaction of reflexes) caused increases in MSNA that were comparable with the increases during handgrip alone: +114 +/- 32% versus +175 +/- 89% at 20% MVC and +328 +/- 101% versus +431 +/- 110% at 30% MVC (handgrip plus LBNP vs. handgrip alone, p greater than 0.1). Pressor and heart rate responses to handgrip also were unaffected by LBNP. In five additional experiments, comparable findings were obtained when the LBNP was superimposed on handgrip rather than handgrip being superimposed on LBNP. In conclusion, this study provides direct evidence in humans that nonhypotensive LBNP does not augment muscle sympathetic outflow during static handgrip and challenges the concept of an important interaction between cardiac baroreceptor and exercise pressor reflexes during this form of exercise.\r"

Data were analyzed with a nested analysis of variance design that yields estimates of variance components. From the estimates of variance components, power calculations and minimum significant percent reductions in frequency and duration of ischemia were derived. During 4,656 hours of ambulatory ECG monitoring, 1,262 episodes of ischemic ST segment depression were detected. The frequency of episodes was 6.3 +/- 0.45/24 hr (mean +/- SEM), and the duration of episodes was 18.3 +/- 2.8/24 hr. Because of variability over time, the ability to detect significant changes was dependent upon the number of subjects, length of monitoring period, and intervals between monitoring periods. In a clinical trial, for example, a sample size of 25 patients monitored for 48 hours with 1 week between control and test conditions would require a 65% reduction in frequency, whereas a sample size of 50 patients monitored under similar conditions would require a 46% reduction in frequency, to attribute the change with 90% power to a therapeutic intervention rather than to a spontaneous variation. When monitoring a single patient for 48 hours with 1 week or 1 month between control and repeat monitoring sessions, episodes of ischemic ST depression must be eliminated to detect significant therapeutic changes in ischemic activity at the 95% confidence level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "With single-beat analysis, the new concept of systolic myocardial stiffness is applied to provide a new approach for the assessment of myocardial contractility in aortic and mitral valve disease. Seventy patients underwent diagnostic right and left heart catheterization. Twenty-six patients had aortic stenosis, 18 had aortic insufficiency, and 26 had mitral regurgitation. Patients with aortic stenosis were divided into two groups on the basis of left ventricular mass index less than 172 g/m2 (AS1) and mass index greater than or equal to 172 g/m2 (AS2). The mitral regurgitation patients were divided into those in normal sinus rhythm (MR1) and those in atrial fibrillation (MR2). Nine patients without significant coronary or cardiovascular disease served as controls. Thirteen patients with aortic stenosis and eight with aortic insufficiency were evaluated (average, approximately 18 months) after successful aortic valve replacement. With simultaneous left ventricular pressure and cineangiographic methods, myocardial contractility was assessed by the conventional ejection fraction-afterload relation (uncorrected for preload) and by two new methods that permit the correction of the ejection fraction for preload. Assessments of the contractile state by these two new methods differed from those by the conventional method in 20-40% of the cases studied. Contractile state improved postoperatively in aortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency even in patients with preoperative depressed contractile states. In patients with mitral regurgitation, there was considerable heterogeneity of contractile function preoperatively. Severe left ventricular hypertrophy in aortic stenosis was not a marker for postoperative outcome since contractility was normal postoperatively in AS1 and AS2 in equal numbers. This study demonstrates that preload correction is important in a preoperative assessment of contractility in aortic and mitral valve disease but that it is less important postoperatively, presumably because of reductions in the preload.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine 1) whether a combined radionuclide-hemodynamic technique could define the right ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation (RV ESPVR) in the clinical setting, 2) whether the human RV ESPVR defined by maximal elastance is linear and responsive to inotropic interventions, and 3) whether more easily measured modifications of the ESPVR are reliable substitutes as an index of RV function. Eight patients with normal RV function were studied with simultaneous micromanometer RV pressure measurements and radionuclide ventriculography to construct RV pressure-volume loops. Data were collected at baseline and after at least two alterations in loading conditions with nitroglycerin, phenylephrine, or saline. End systole was defined by maximal elastance (E(t) = P(t)/[V(t) - V0]). Data were also obtained during administration of dobutamine in four patients and after atrial pacing tachycardia in one patient. The RV ESPVR defined by maximal elastance was highly linear (r = 0.988-0.999) throughout the range of pressures and volumes tested. Furthermore, the linear correlations were significantly higher (p less than 0.005), and the linear regression standard error of the estimate (SEE) was significantly lower (p less than 0.005) for the RV ESPVR defined by maximal elastance compared with modifications of the ESPVR with the ratio of pulmonary artery-dicrotic notch pressure or RV peak pressure to end-ejection volume. Dobutamine or atrial pacing tachycardia produced a leftward shift of the entire RV pressure-volume loop, and in each patient (five of five), the point of maximal elastance fell outside the 95% confidence interval defined by the baseline ESPVR. However, because of the larger SEE, the leftward shift with modifications of the ESPVR was not statistically significant in any patient by the pulmonary artery-dicrotic notch pressure: end-ejection volume ratio and was significant in only one of five patients by the RV peak pressure: end-ejection volume ratio (p less than 0.03). Therefore, it appears that the steady-state RV ESPVR defined by maximal elastance in patients with normal RV function is responsive to alterations in inotropic state and is more sensitive to alterations in RV function than the frequently used, more easily measured modifications of the RV ESPVR.\r"

CLi was used as a measure of the proximal tubular fluid output (Vprox). CLi showed considerable spontaneous variations from one 2-hour period to another, and neither bladder emptying errors nor changes of CCr could account for these. The variations of CLi, which reflected variations of Vprox, resulted in joint variations of CNa and CK. Also the ratios CNa/CLi and CK/CLi, which reflected the distal handling of sodium and potassium, showed considerable spontaneous variations. These were correlated neither with each other nor with variations of CLi. Our study indicates that through the use of CLi as a measure of Vprox it is possible to distinguish between a single joint proximal regulation and two separate distal regulations of sodium and potassium excretion. Further studies concerning the interplay between proximal and distal regulations under normal and pathological conditions may provide deeper insight into the way in which the kidney functions.\r"

Fourteen patients with chronic renal failure were studied during two successive dialysis treatments for which either acetate or bicarbonate were used as a buffer anion in the dialysate. In the acetate studies the mean plasma acetate concentration in the arterial line rose from 0.16 mM to 4.67 mM, while it rose from 0.17 mM to 0.62 mM during bicarbonate dialysis. There was a linear relationship between acetate utilization and the acetate concentration in the venous line. The increase of the blood pH during bicarbonate HD was due to an immediate increase of HCO3, whereas acetate caused a smaller HCO3 rise and a pronounced fall of the pCO2. The heart rate was higher during acetate than during bicarbonate HD. During both types of dialysis there was a twofold rise of total FFA as well as the individual fatty acids palmitate, palmitoleate, oleate, stearate and linoleate which was of similar magnitude when acetate or bicarbonate were used. The postulated antilipolytic effect of the short-chain fatty acid acetate could not be demonstrated under the circumstances of routine hemodialysis. Pre-dialysis dopamine was elevated in 7 of the 11 patients and remained high during both types of HD; other hormones were normal during acetate and bicarbonate HD.\r"

Each subject received both an i.v. and an i.p. 1 g dose of fosfomycin with a one week washout between doses. Fosfomycin was assayed by a microbiological diffusion technique. After intravenous injection the fosfomycin serum kinetic parameters were as followed: elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) 38.4 +/- 8.7 h; volume of distribution 0.32 +/- 0.02 l/kg; total plasma clearance 7.0 +/- 1.4 ml/min and peritoneal clearance 3.2 +/- 0.2 ml/min. Dialyzate fosfomycin concentrations reached a maximum mean value of 32.2 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml at 4 h post-injection and fosfomycin was detectable in dialyzate samples for up to 72 hours post-dosing. After intraperitoneal instillation, fosfomycin appeared in the serum rapidly and the mean peak plasma concentration was 36.2 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml at the 4th h. The absorption rate (ka) was 0.580 +/- 0.039 h-1 and the absorption of fosfomycin from peritoneal space was 68.4 +/- 6.0%. These data suggest a bidirectional exchange through the peritoneal membrane. Intraperitoneal administration of 1 g either 48 h apart for anephric patients or 36 h apart for patients with residual renal function may achieve therapeutic serum concentrations.\r"

A careful analysis of the most recent publications in the world literature reveals a high complication rate for both types of prostheses, each one having specific advantages and disadvantages. The Gschwend-Scheier-Bahler (GSB) III prosthesis is a semiconstrained prosthesis, requires little bone resection, and is therefore easily salvaged. The results in regard to pain relief and improvement in range of motion are satisfactory in a high percentage of patients. The rate of lasting complications is lower than with most of the other prostheses. The authors' transtricipital approach is also a factor that contributes to the high success rate. In case of a failed arthroplasty the authors' method of reconstructing the humeral condyles allows a better salvage.\r"

The biopsy study was correlated with gait analysis. In 53 biopsy specimens the muscles were found to be histologically abnormal, presenting myogenic and neurogenic alterations. Furthermore, ultrastructural examination showed enlarged mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions in 31 of the 57 cases. Gait analysis showed an abnormal rollover pattern in 70% of the gait cycles examined in 19 symptomatic hallux valgus patients (18 women and one man), while in 19 asymptomatic volunteers (16 women and three men) 80% of the cycles examined were normal. The surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of the intrinsic muscles also was abnormal in the patient group when compared with the volunteer group; five different patterns of electrical activity were found. These findings may be interpreted as a result of chronic ischemia caused by the elevated pressure occurring within the foot during gait.\r"

The amount of inhibitor activity was measured by determining the amount of hydroxyapatite needed to induce calcium phosphate precipitation in a solution with a constant calcium phosphate supersaturation. Rat calvaria in culture released inhibitor activity. This activity was separated by chromatography on a Bio-Gel P4 column into a high molecular weight (HMW) fraction and a low molecular weight (LMW) fraction. The latter contained, among others, citrate and pyrophosphate (PPi), but the concentration of these was too low to account for the total activity observed. The identity of the HMW and the remaining LMW inhibitors are at present unknown. Various populations of calvaria cells also produced these two types of inhibitors, 20% of the LMW being due to PPi. Fibroblasts produced only the HMW type of inhibitors. These results suggest that cells might control the process of biologic calcification by regulating the amount of inhibitors they produce.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the histophysiology of implant degradation, hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate cylinders with a diameter of 3 mm were implanted in the cancellous bone of the distal femur and the proximal tibia of 15 New Zealand White rabbits for up to six months. All implants had a homogeneous pore distribution and a porosity of 60%. Ceramics with a pore size range of 50-100 micron and 200-400 micron were compared. Morphometric analysis showed that up to 85.4% of the originally implanted tricalcium phosphate was degraded after six months, whereas the volume reduction of the hydroxyapatite was only 5.4% after the same period. Within the first months bone and tissue ingrowth and implant resorption occurred at a higher rate in the smaller-pored tricalcium phosphate than in the larger-pored material. Hydroxyapatite cylinders with small pores were totally infiltrated by bone or bone marrow after four months, whereas in the larger-pored hydroxyapatite implants tissue did not penetrate all pores after six months and the amount of bone within the implant was small. Scanning electron microscopy of the material before implantation revealed the existence of numerous pore interconnections with diameters of about 20 micron in the smaller-pored ceramics. Such interconnections were rare in the larger-pored implants. The pore interconnections seem to promote vascular and tissue ingrowth and consequently the initial rate of implant resorption. Implant resorption is an active process and involves two different cell types. Acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast-like cells suggesting active resorption adhere directly to the surface, especially in tricalcium phosphate implants. Clusters of macrophages tightly packed with granular material are found in the pores and along the perimeter of all implant cylinders. They may play an active role in the intracellular degradation of small detached ceramic particles.\r"

A method to simulate the operative correction helps the surgeon in planning osteotomies of the femur and pelvis.

Satisfactory results were observed most frequently in the male patients, those with a Q angle less than 20 degrees, and others in whom no form of internal fixation was used, and those patients with a follow-up period of less than three years.

Total clinical and roentgenographical evaluation was undertaken after 5-11 years (mean, 8.1 years) and included all 75 surviving patients. Fully comparable results were encountered in the 15 patients who died during the observation period. There were no early revisions but five late revisions; two due to loosening, one late infection, one instability, and one intractable pain. Complete loosening occurred in four patients (4%). Functional score (Hospital for Special Surgery method) averaged 77 points (preoperative, 43) with no tendency of deterioration with time. Loss of initially achieved alignment was generally associated with bone resorption around the tibial component. Minor arthrotic changes of the non-operated compartment occurred in 4% of the cases.\r"

Seventeen patients with unilateral shaft fractures of the femur had ipsilateral knee ligament injuries, or 5.3%. There was no relationship between specific ligament damage and the cause of the injury or level of fracture. Twelve patients were followed for an average of 34 months. Five patients lacked full extension and ten lacked full flexion. Two of seven patients with ligament repair and three of five patients without ligament repair had at least one unstable ligament. Better range of knee motion was obtained when both the femur and ligament injuries were surgically managed, but most (seven of 12) patients were disabled.\r"

In this study, finite element analyses were performed to determine the stress fields in the natural glenoid and to calculate the change in bone stresses after implantation of glenoid components of various designs. The effects of metal backing, keel geometry, and superior constraint on bone stresses indicate that stress distributions on the natural glenoid corresponded to bone morphology. Metal-backing the glenoid component may cause slight improvement in stress transfer to cortical bone. Altered fin geometry better stabilized the glenoid component. Superior restraints on the component intending to prevent subluxation increase stresses and may cause earlier loosening than encountered with unconstrained components.\r"

The identification of the joint capsule is performed through a Smith-Petersen approach, which also permits all osteotomies to be performed about the acetabulum. This osteotomy does not change the diameter of the true pelvis, but allows an extensive acetabular reorientation including medial and lateral displacement. Preparations and injections of the vessels of the hip joint on cadavers have shown that the osteotomized fragment perfusion after correction is sufficient. Because the posterior pillar stays mechanically intact the acetabular fragment can be stabilized sufficiently using two screws. This stability allows patients to partially bear weight after osteotomy without immobilization. Since 1984, 75 periacetabular osteotomies of the hip have been performed. The corrections are 31 degrees for the vertical center-edge (VCE) angle of Wiberg and 26 degrees for the corresponding angle of Lequesne and de Seze in the sagittal plane. Complications have included two intraarticular osteotomies, a femoral nerve palsy that resolved, one nonunion, and ectopic bone formation in four patients prior to the prophylactic use of indomethacin. Thirteen patients required screw removal. There was no evidence of vascular impairment of the osteotomized fragment.\r"

After a mean follow-up period of 49.7 months, the patients were recalled for interview, physical examination, air plethysmography (APG), and photoplethysmography (PPG). At the time of follow-up examination, legs with prior postoperative venous thrombosis were not more likely to have clinical findings of deep venous insufficiency than legs with a negative venogram. Abnormal venous emptying, as measured by APG, was significantly correlated (p less than 0.005) with postoperative venous thrombosis and was found in patients with both proximal and calf vein thrombi, but was not clearly associated with symptoms. There was, however, a significant correlation (p less than 0.0005) between clinical findings of venous insufficiency and incompetent valves, as reflected by rapid refilling time after exercise shown by PPG. The findings indicate that asymptomatic postoperative venous thrombosis involving calf or proximal veins can lead to abnormal vein function, but is not closely correlated with later development of symptoms. These observations also suggest that symptomatic venous insufficiency is more closely associated with calf vein valve incompetence than with proximal vein obstruction.\r"

Compared with the control, a 95.2% decrease was found in the number of proteoglycan granules periodically associated with the cross-banding of collagen fibrils in one OI sample from a patient with severe bony fragility. Extractability of collagen fibrils and proteoglycans was high in this sample. However, proteoglycans and collagen fibrils could be reattached in vitro to reproduce the condition observed in the controls. There was no decrease in the number of proteoglycan granules attached to prepared collagen fibrils in a sample from a patient with predominantly bowing deformity of bones. Hypothetically, the separation of proteoglycans from collagen fibrils in OI may be associated with increased bony fragility. In osteogenesis imperfecta patients, the mechanism inducing bowing deformity appears to be different from that inducing fragility.\r"

The agents tested were cortisone acetate (CA), cyclophosphamide (CY), procarbazine (PCH), and antithymocyte serum (ATS). Their effect on syngeneic grafts was examined morphologically and histomorphometrically. In untreated recipients, chondrocytes formed cartilage nodules that underwent endochondral ossification. Except for high repetitive doses of CY, none of the other agents interfered with normal cartilage formation. However, all agents affected endochondral ossification. In the allogeneic system, the effect of immunosuppression was examined morphologically and by evaluation of specific humoral and cellular antigraft immunity. Allogeneic chondrocytes evoked a strong immune response in untreated mice, and cartilage was gradually destroyed by infiltrating cells. Endochondral ossification did not occur in this system. Neither agent given alone exerted a marked, long-lasting protective effect upon the graft. However, combined treatment with ATS and PCH inhibited immune response and completely prevented infiltrate formation and allowed endochondral ossification similar to that in the syngeneic control. Although some weak signs of antigraft immunity were seen after six weeks, it is possible that they were due to secondary exposure of antigen-bearing chondrocytes in the course of endochondral ossification.\r"

Transfer of the latissimus dorsi tendon from the humeral shaft to the superolateral humeral head provides a large, vascularized tendon that can be used to close a massive cuff defect and that exerts an external rotation and head-depressing moment that allow more effective action of the deltoid muscle. This procedure was carried out in 14 patients without any significant complications. Pain relief and functional results in those four cases with a minimum follow-up period of one year (average, 14 months) compared favorably with alternative treatment methods and warrant further anatomic, electromyographic, and clinical investigation.\r"

This single operative procedure allows reduction of the iatrogenic trauma by avoiding an additional anterior exposure. Total posterior vertebrectomy has been performed successfully in a total of nine cases in this study. In three early cases the spine was stabilized with posterior transpedicular plate fixation. The six most recent cases in which the AO internal fixator was used have verified the effectiveness of this fixation system.

The coating (Sulmesh) consists of a net shell of four layers of orderly oriented wire meshes with specific pore size and porosity volume. The pure titanium wires are bonded together. The advantages of the press-fit cup are the excellent adaptation with minimal resection and the preservation of the subchondral bone. The preparation of the acetabulum is easy (reaming only), no additional fixation by screws is necessary, and only a few instruments are needed. The results of 81 total hip arthoplasties using the press-fit cup and having an observation period ranging from 12 to 24 months show no clinical or roentgenographic loosening.

One of these was a responder, the other a nonresponder. A brief test period in prone position is indicated in ARDS patients to identify those who may benefit from this postural treatment. The definite mechanism of the arterial oxygenation improvement observed remains to be clarified.\r"

  ".W": "Overnight falls in peak expiratory flow (PEF) (with the morning dip of the index) may be considered the hallmark of nocturnal asthma. To validate the morning dip a quantitative marker of the degree of nocturnal bronchoconstriction, the dip was measured in 11 subjects (six with a history consistent with nocturnal asthma) undergoing all-night monitoring of lower respiratory resistance by a double-catheter method. In six subjects, marked and recurrent increases in resistance were recorded, along with morning dips higher than 20 percent; however, on the following morning, only two of them reported having suffered significant breathlessness and wheeze. Peak and average values for resistance, as well as the duration for which resistance was increased, were closely correlated with the magnitude of morning dips. Therefore, unlike the subjective report, PEF may be considered a reliable quantitative indicator of nocturnal bronchoconstriction.\r"

It therefore becomes difficult to identify patients clinically with an underlying electrophysiologic substrate for ventricular tachycardia which was made manifest by an antiarrhythmic drug, or to determine whether the drug is causing an idiosyncratic reaction (the classic \"long Q-T syndrome\"). We recently studied a patient with ischemic heart disease and a prolonged corrected Q-T interval (Q-Tc) due to chronic left bundle-branch block. She developed \"quinidine syncope,\" and the Q-Tc was unchanged despite stopping administration of the drug; however, electrophysiologic studies demonstrated reproducibly inducible \"torsade de pointes\" while the patient was being rechallenged with quinidine, while no inducible arrhythmia was seen during control studies. We conclude that electrophysiologic studies are of clinical value in the clarification of possible drug-induced arrhythmias.\r"

Reductions in diffusing capacity, FVC, and total lung capacity did not change significantly for the group over the period of our study. The mean FEF25-75%, which was initially low, and the mean FEV1/FVC ratio, which was initially normal, both decreased significantly. The observed abnormalities in airway function were not related to smoking history. Other aspects of lupus activity, as measured by serum creatinine levels and clinical activity, did not appear related to progression of lung disease.\r"

Only 2,731 (45 percent) of the infected contacts were started on preventive therapy. Both the absolute number and the relative percentage of infected contacts starting on INH prevention therapy have gradually declined over the years. While 569 (67 percent) of the infected contacts were started on preventive treatment in 1979, only 296 (37.5 percent) received isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy in 1985. Although an increasing percentage of those starting preventive therapy completed the prescribed course, the enthusiasm for recommending preventive therapy has declined for the infected individuals above the age of 15.

In almost all cases of benign tumors and in many carcinoid tumors, the treatment was curative. In genuine nonmalignant tracheal stenoses, laser therapy was curative in 34 out of 81 cases. In malignant tumors, the laser improved airway gauge 92 percent of the time. Cumulative survival was 50 percent (+/- 3 percent) at six months and 26 percent (+/- 3 percent) at one year. Following palliative laser therapy, eight patients with bronchogenic carcinoma appearing to be inoperable did have surgery and ten underwent less extensive surgery than expected. Results confirm the usefulness and safety of this relatively new method in the treatment of obstructive lesions of the tracheobronchial tree.\r"

Therefore, we measured arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2) continuously using pulse oximetry in 29 patients (age range, 21 to 83 years) undergoing cardiac catheterization. Baseline SaO2 was 96 +/- 0.4 percent. All patients had a decrease in SaO2 at some time during the procedure. Eleven patients (38 percent) had episodes of arterial hypoxemia, defined as a decrease in SaO2 below 90 percent. In these 11 patients, the mean number of episodes of hypoxemia was 16 +/- 7, and the mean duration of each episode was 53 +/- 25 seconds. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that the minimum SaO2 during catheterization for any patient was significantly associated with the baseline SaO2, duration of the procedure, and end-diastolic volume (EDV) as described by the following regression equation: minimum SaO2 = 46.8 - 0.0580 (duration of procedure in minutes) + 0.5362 (baseline SaO2) - 0.0159 (EDV). Based on our finding of arterial hypoxemia in greater than one third of our patients, we would consider continuous SaO2 monitoring or supplemental oxygen during cardiac catheterization, especially for those patients with poor ventricular function or low resting SaO2 or those expected to have long procedures.\r"

Data obtained were submitted to three types of analysis. Respiratory disturbance index, oxygen saturation indices, body mass index, and total nocturnal sleep time did not significantly correlate with daytime sleepiness, as measured by the MSLT. Analysis of subgroups based on weight and degree of alertness also showed a nonsignificant correlation with daytime sleepiness. The best predictor of the excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) frequently found in OSAS patients was the nocturnal polygraphic recording of the sleep disturbances and sleep structure anomalies that reflect the brain's overall dysfunction in OSAS. Understanding why an electroencephalogram arousal response occurs during sleep in association with abnormal breathing and how this response can become blunted may help us to better predict the development of EDS.\r"

Therefore, we compared the biases (differences between means) of six models of blood gas instruments using five varieties of ampuled quality control materials and a single source of tonometered fresh human blood at three levels of PO2 (67.5, 91.4, and 143.6 mm Hg). All materials correlated positively with blood, thus demonstrating consistency of machine biases. The coefficients of variation measuring blood and a perfluorocarbon mixture (abc) were not different, but were higher for aqueous and hemoglobin-containing mixtures. On average, at the PO2 levels tested, the differences among instruments were slightly smaller with abc than with blood, but larger with aqueous and hemoglobin-containing materials. Because abc \"tracks\" tonometered blood reasonably well at the PO2 levels tested, instrument differences in PO2 detected with abc are also likely to be seen with clinical blood samples. The other four quality control materials probably overestimate instrument differences in measuring PO2.\r"

Causes of catheter failure included kinking, malposition, inadvertent removal by patient, occlusion of the tube or valve by pleural fluid, and large air leak. No complication attributable to tube placement occurred. When the flutter valve was employed, the patient was able to ambulate allowing for potential outpatient therapy.

Three of these patients were farmers, and one was a road construction worker. Lung asbestos content of these cases was compared with that of a group of nine persons living in the same vicinity who did not have pleural plaques. The plaque group was found to have an equal chrysotile content but about a fourfold elevation in median tremolite content, a statistically significant increase. Fiber sizes were the same in both groups. Also, one plaque case had an elevated level of relatively long titanium oxide fibers. These observations suggest that environmental pleural plaques in this region of Quebec are probably caused by exposure to tremolite derived from local soil and rock and that other types of mineral fibers such as titanium oxide may occasionally also be the cause of such lesions.\r"

Six hypoxemic patients were studied. All six had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, though one patient had kyphoscoliosis with mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. Patients were studied during each activity of daily life while receiving supplemental oxygen by continuous flow nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute and during use of the demand oxygen saver system. The demand oxygen system produced arterial oxygenation equivalent to continuous flow nasal cannula under all conditions while utilizing substantially less oxygen. When compared with administration of oxygen by continuous flow nasal cannula, the demand oxygen saver cannula utilized only 45 percent as much oxygen during seated rest, 44 percent as much oxygen during exercise, and 39 percent as much oxygen during sleep. Our data support the use of demand oxygen systems for treatment of hypoxemia in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.\r"

Children were matched for age and sex and went without medication for at least 12 hours before each experiment. The children breathed dry warm air (TI = 28.4 degrees C +/- 0.3 degree C) for 15 minutes while bicycling at constant and moderate work load (50 W). The MH2O was measured by collecting and weighing the expired water vapor (1) at rest breathing in warm conditions of inspired gas (control values), (2) every five minutes during exercise while breathing dry warm air, and (3) four minutes after the end of exercise. Pulmonary function tests were performed before and six minutes after exercise. The results were abnormal only in children with exercise-induced asthma. During exercise, RWL significantly fell (compared to control value) at the tenth and 15th minute in both groups. Whereas normal subjects recovered their initial values for MH2O four minutes after stopping exercise, asthmatic children still had a reduction in respiratory water loss. During exercise, MH2O decreased a little more in healthy than in asthmatic children. The decrease in MH2O in both groups suggests that the means to fully humidify expired gas are overwhelmed by thermal stress. The lack of increase in MH2O in asthmatic children on stopping exercise suggests that the airway mucosa is unable to produce enough water vapor and is thus dehydrated and probably hyperosmotic.\r"

We found a significant correlation between the severity of snoring and nasal airflow resistance in both groups, and between the severity of snoring and pharyngeal and glottic areas in the apneic group.

We also found a statistically insignificant (NS) increase in the incidence of infrequent VEBs in 18 normal control subjects (four of 18, no caffeine vs nine of 18 caffeine). Because of the high risk of beta-error among the previously-studied normal control subjects, we tested another group of 34 normal subjects, 15 males and 19 females with a mean age of 31 years (range 21 to 49 years), using a higher dose of caffeine. All subjects abstained from caffeine for 72 hours and had a control 24-hour Holter ECG recorded between hours 48 and 72. Caffeine half-life was calculated for each subject and caffeine was then ingested at 1 mg/kg every 0.5 half-life during all waking hours. A 24-hour Holter test was recorded, beginning just prior to the second caffeine dose. It was concluded that in normal adults, even high-dose caffeine does not affect prevailing cardiac rhythm and rate, and moreover, does not cause clinically significant ventricular or supraventricular dysrhythm.\r"

Measurement of the heart rate at ventilatory threshold (VT) by expired gas analysis provides a direct index of the upper limits of conditioning intensity. We evaluated 115 nonsmoking, healthy adults with measurement of peak oxygen uptake to classify groups as low- (n = 45), average-(n = 45), and high (n = 25) -fitness. Heart rate at VT was compared with the approximate midpoint (77 percent) of recommended training intensity as estimated by the Karvonen equation, predicted maximal (220-age), and measured maximal HR formulas. No significant difference among the various HR formulas at 77 percent and HR at VT were found for high-fitness individuals. Among the low- and average-fitness groups, the Karvonen formula at 77 percent was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than HR at ventilatory threshold. Predicted and measured maximal HR at 77 percent were not above the VT among the low- and average-fitness individuals and are appropriate for training intensity. However, the Karvonen formula appears to overestimate heart rate intensity among those of low and average fitness and may be excessive for these groups.\r"

Bronchoscopy was performed in 28 patients, resulting in a diagnosis of infection, hemorrhage, or malignancy in 19 cases. Open lung biopsy (OLB) was obtained in 23 patients, yielding a diagnosis of interstitial inflammation or fibrosis (13 cases), drug effect (three), malignancy (two), hemorrhage (one), Pneumocystis (seven), aspergillosis (two), and Legionella (one). Only two patients survived following OLB. Despite intensive management and adequate diagnosis, respiratory failure in patients with hematologic malignancy carries a high mortality. Although these data may help identify groups with a limited prognosis for long-term recovery, patient care must be individualized.\r"

  ".W": "Because recent knowledge indicates that the distribution of fat deposits in men may be a better predictor of cardiovascular disease than the degree of obesity alone, some risk factors for atherosclerosis were evaluated in 51 middle-aged men with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Abdominal adiposity (waist/hip ratio, WHR) was related to parameters of metabolic control, lipid parameters, and known vascular complications in three different groups. In groups with abdominal obesity, mean annual hemoglobin A1 was significantly (P less than .01) higher than in patients without an abdominal fat distribution. Atherogenic index was significantly increased in the group with the highest WHR and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol) levels were significantly decreased in both groups with upper-body fat distribution. The frequency of peripheral vascular disease, coronary ischemic heart disease, and hypertension was most prominent in diabetic subjects with an abdominal fat mass distribution. A highly significant (P less than .001) correlation was present between WHR and HDL-chol and WHR and the total-cholesterol/HDL-chol ratio; this significant correlation remains after correction for body mass index. A similar correlation could be found between WHR and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. These results demonstrate an association of excess abdominal fat, even without manifest obesity, with worse diabetes metabolic control, cardiovascular complications, and blood lipid levels actually considered to play an important role in atherogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Different starchy foods produce different glycemic responses when fed individually, and there is some evidence that this also applies in the context of the mixed meal. A major reason appears to relate to the rate at which the foods are digested and the factors influencing this. A similar ranking in terms of glycemic response to specific foods is seen independent of the carbohydrate tolerance status of the groups tested. Potentially clinically useful starchy foods producing relatively flat glycemic responses have been identified. Many of these are considered ethnic or traditional and include legumes; pasta; grains such as barley, parboiled rice, and bulgur (cracked wheat); and whole-grain breads such as pumpernickel. Specific incorporation of these foods into diets has been associated with reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels in hyperlipidemia and with improved blood glucose control in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. To facilitate identification of such foods, it has been suggested that the glycemic response should be indexed to a standard (e.g., white bread) to allow comparisons to be made between the glycemic index of foods tested in different groups of subjects. The scope of application of this principle is subject to further investigation. It may be used to expand the range of possibly useful starchy foods for trial in the diets of diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of breast feeding on circulating thyroid hormone levels in the suckling neonate, we examined serum concentrations of T4, T3, and rT3 by RIA in 12- and 15-day-old rat pups fasted for 3 or 6 h before, at, and hourly for 3 or 4 h after suckling. In both age groups, serum T4 levels decreased significantly in response to the 6-h fast; no significant differences were observed after 3 h. T3 levels in 15-day-old (but not 12-day-old) rats were likewise significantly depressed, and rT3 levels were higher relative to those in the prefast group. After a 90-min suckling period, serum total and free T4 concentrations of 12-day-old pups increased 1 h postsuckling to levels significantly higher than those in the fasted animals; maximum levels were achieved at 2 h. T3 levels were unchanged over this period. In contrast, elevated total and free T4 and T3 levels and a reciprocal decrease in rT3 concentration, were evident immediately after the 90-min suckling period (0 h) in 15-day-old rat pups and increased through 1 h to levels significantly higher than those in the prefast group. After refeeding (0 h) of 3-h fasted pups, serum T4 levels increased significantly over fasted levels in suckled 12- and 15-day-old rats, as did T3 levels in 15-day-old pups, through 2 h postsuckling. In contrast, thyroid hormone levels of pups gavage-fed a commercial formula preparation at no time exceeded those of the prefast groups at either age, despite highly comparable stomach weights for both formula-fed and suckled pups at the time of refeeding. We conclude that 1) rat pups between the ages of 12 and 15 days postpartum become hypothyroxinemic between 3 and 6 h of milk deprivation, and 2) this condition is reversed by significant increases in T4 and T3, rendering the animal transiently hyperthyroxinemic after suckling, but not in response to formula feeding. Our data further demonstrate the critical nature of study designs involving fasts (either planned or incidental) of suckling rats in light of the observed pronounced variations in their thyroid hormone status relative to time postsuckling.\r"

The results of these investigations demonstrate acute effects of calcitonin on skeletal tissues derived from embryonic chickens to increase calvarial cell proliferation ([3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA) and bone matrix synthesis ([3H]proline incorporation into collagen, as [3H]hydroxyproline) in intact calvaria and tibiae. The effects of calcitonin on [3H]thymidine incorporation were significant at 1 mU/ml (0.08 nM; P less than 0.05), additive with respect to the action(s) of F (calcitonin increased the maximum effect of F, and F increased the effect of low dose calcitonin; P less than 0.01 for each), associated with an increase in total cell protein (r = 0.82; P less than 0.02), and inversely dependent on osteoblastic differentiation (r = -0.96; P less than 0.005). The effects of calcitonin to increase bone matrix synthesis ([3H]hydroxyproline incorporation, 139% and 155% of untreated control values for tibiae and calvaria, respectively; P less than 0.005 for each) were maximal at approximately 5 mU/ml (0.4 nM) and associated with a proportional increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in the bones (r = 0.71; P less than 0.05 for tibiae). These effects of calcitonin were not dependent on continuous exposure. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was increased in calvarial cells 16 h after a 4-h limited (inductive) exposure to calcitonin (at 3 mU/ml; P less than 0.01). [3H]Proline incorporation in embryonic chicken calvaria was also increased during 3 days of limited exposure (i.e. 4 h/day) to 10 mU/ml calcitonin (P less than 0.02). The proliferative action(s) of calcitonin was not unique to chicken osteoblastline cells. Salmon calcitonin also increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in the transformed murine calvarial cell lines MMB and MC-3T3-E1 and in primary cultures of cells prepared from newborn mouse calvaria (P less than 0.05 for each). Furthermore, these effects were observed at calcitonin doses (3-30 mU/ml) that also decreased murine bone resorption (i.e. 45Ca release from prelabeled neonatal mouse calvaria; P less than 0.01).\r"

Spleen cells from one strongly immunoreactive mouse were fused with Sp2 mouse myeloma cells, and 328 hybridomas were screened by a dot-blot immunoassay using as antigen, a preparation of NTR partially purified by diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex chromatography. Four positive cultures were thus found; three of which were confirmed by comparing Western blotting patterns with the electrophoretic mobility of the affinity-labeled NTR. One of these 3 hybridomas was further subcloned by limiting dilution and gave rise to the 2B3 clone, which produces an immunoglobulin of the immunoglobulin G1 subclass. Several lines of evidence indicated that the 2B3 monoclonal antibody was indeed directed against the NTR. The antibody recognized a protein with the same electrophoretic mobility as the affinity-labeled receptor. Thus, Western blotting revealed a predominant protein with a mol wt of 57,000 and a less abundant 45,000 component on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, and multiple isoelectric variants of the 57,000 protein, with a predominant form at pI 6.2, were detected on two-dimensional gels. Incubation of the 2B3 antibody with the NTR labeled with [125I]T3 resulted in the formation of an antibody-receptor complex, as indicated by a shift of the radioactivity peak upon gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. In contrast, control ascitic fluid did not change the elution profile of the labeled NTR. The 2B3 antibody is able to remove the T3-binding activity from rat liver nuclear extracts. Finally, in accordance with previous T3-binding experiments, expected amounts of NTR were found in pituitary, liver, brain, kidney, spleen, and testis with the use of the Western blotting technique and immunohistochemistry on frozen tissue sections. This antibody should prove useful in the characterization and purification of the NTR and also in the study of its distribution in different tissues and cell types.\r"

In this study, we have used a radioautographic method to examine the competitive binding of 125I-labeled rat PTH-(1-34) to the long bones of rats in vivo. Our studies confirm the presence of competitive binding to mature osteoblasts and the absence of significant competitive binding to multinucleated osteoclasts. However, by light and electron microscopic radioautographic analysis, the majority of specific competitive PTH binding was present over a cell in the intertrabecular space of the metaphyseal region, which was distinct from the mature osteoblast. This large mononuclear cell with multiple cytoplasmic extensions appeared to interface with both the bone matrix and the microvascular osseous circulation and may provide an additional target to mediate hormonal effects on the skeleton.\r"

The latter enzyme as well as the type I enzyme activity at micromolar substrate concentrations required higher (greater than 10 mM) concentrations of GSH. However, GSH appeared to interact with the type I and type II enzymes even at subactivation levels, since it inhibited the activation of these enzymes by dithiothreitol (DTT). Activation of the renal and hepatic low Km I-5'D by GSH resembled that by DTT in 1) the similarity of Km values for both T4 (20 nM) and rT3 (2 nM), 2) the catalytic mechanism (ordered sequential with the iodothyronine as the second substrate), 3) the values for activation energies, and 4) sensitivity to inhibition by propylthiouracil. However, the low Km I-5'D activated by GSH was about 10-fold more sensitive to inhibition by iopanoate than when activated by DTT. The responsiveness of the low Km I-5'D's in renal and hepatic microsomes to physiological concentrations of GSH suggests their participation in the metabolism of iodothyronines in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism of thyroid hormone-induced cardiac hypertrophy, we have studied the in vivo changes in cardiac size and total myocardial content of both membrane and cytoskeletal enzymes in the rat after the administration of excess thyroid hormone. In response to 50 micrograms T4/day, there is a significant increase in heart rate and heart work associated with an increase in total heart size and protein content. Measurements of the specific activity of Na,K-ATPase and p-nitrophenol phosphatase demonstrate a small but significant increase in specific activity, while the specific activity of myosin ATPase is unchanged. To further probe the mechanism for T4-mediated hypertrophy we studied the in vivo effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on rat heart size. When animals were treated with both T4 and propranolol (10 mg/animal.day) cardiac hypertrophy was prevented. Propranolol alone at this dose did not affect heart rate, heart weight, or serum levels of T4 and T3. The present data suggest that 1) the hypertrophic response of the myocardium to excess thyroid hormone involves cytoplasmic as well as membrane proteins, 2) the increase in total myocardial protein, which can be blocked by propranolol, is indirectly mediated by increases in cardiac work rather than a direct effect of thyroid hormone.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPD) and cytosolic malic enzyme (ME) response to a single injection of a receptor-saturating dose of T3 were measured 10, 20, and 30 days after diabetes induction, and compared with values in controls either fed ad libitum (C) or under a restricted diet (FR). An insulin-treated diabetic (D + I) group was also included. Basal enzyme levels as well as enzyme response to T3 injection were correlated with nuclear T3 content, maximal nuclear T3-binding capacity (MBC) and equilibrium association constant (Ka). Diabetes for 10, 20, and 30 days was associated with a progressive decrease in the MBC; the mean decrease was 17%, 50%, and 59%, respectively, from the corresponding C values. The MBC in FR animals did not change appreciably during the experimental period. Moreover, neither the decreased MBC in D groups nor MBC in C, FR, or D + I animals were influenced by T3 injection. The Ka values were comparable in all experimental groups. Specifically bound nuclear T3 was decreased within the experimental period between 33% and 73% in D rats and 6% and 39% in FR rats respect to C values. T3 injection raised the mean nuclear T3 content in all groups. However, at each time interval the mean values of the nuclear T3 in D groups was significantly lower than that in C, FR, or D + I groups after T3 injection. The basal alpha-GPD activity tended to be relatively stable during the experimental period in both D and FR rats, whereas ME activity in D and FR groups was decreased, respectively, 52-64% and 18-39% from C values. The response of both alpha-GPD and ME to T3 injection in FR rats was comparable to that of C groups. The alpha-GPD response to T3 in D rats was not different from that of C rats on days 10 and 20 of the experiment, but on day 30 it decreased by 26%. In contrast, the induction of ME by T3 was severely decreased (by 66-88% of C values) within the experimental diabetes period. Thus, the measurements made in FR rats excluded the possibility that the quantitative changes in the enzyme response to T3 in D rats were nutrition-dependent. The differences between the response of alpha-GPD and ME to T3 in D rats suggest that cellular factors play a role in inhibiting or increasing the response to a given concentration of the T3-receptor complex.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously identified and characterized a 97K secretory glycoprotein (uterine secretory protein-1:USP-1) synthesized and secreted by rat uterine epithelial cells under estrogen stimulation. We now have analyzed the qualitative and quantitative effects of antiestrogens (tamoxifen and LY117018) on the induction of USP-1 biosynthesis when administered alone or combined with 17 beta-estradiol (E2). By radioimmune precipitation assay of [35S]methionine-labeled uterine luminal fluid proteins, it was shown that tamoxifen and LY117018 could weakly induce USP-1 compared with E2. Concomitant administration of either tamoxifen or LY117018 with E2 significantly diminished the effects of E2 on USP-1 induction. Hence, both tamoxifen and LY117018 possess agonistic as well as antagonistic properties affecting the induction of USP-1. These agonistic effects of antiestrogens were also evident from the presence of USP-1 in rat uterine epithelial cells treated with antiestrogens, as revealed by immunohistochemical staining. Sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of immunoprecipitable [35S]methionine-labeled protein revealed that USP-1 induced by tamoxifen is larger (110K) than that induced by estrogen or LY117018 (97K). Peptide-N-glycosidase treatment of USP-1 induced by E2 or tamoxifen removed asparagine-linked carbohydrate chains and resulted in the appearance of polypeptides with apparent mol wt of 91K and 105K, respectively. Thus, the higher mol wt of tamoxifen-induced USP-1 is not due to changes in asparagine-linked carbohydrates. Since LY117018 could not induce any qualitative change in the USP-1 molecule, tamoxifen may act on uterine epithelial cells through a different molecular mechanism than LY117018.\r"

There was a clear diurnal rhythm in the plasma MT concentrations in both the ewe and fetus from 114 days gestation. Blood samples were also collected from the pregnant ewe and fetus during the day every 2-3 days from 112 days gestation to term. There was no gestational age trend in maternal or fetal day time plasma MT concentrations during late pregnancy. To establish whether there was transplacental transfer of MT, pregnant ewes were injected with [3H]MT, and total radioactivity (disintegrations per min) was measured in maternal and fetal arterial plasma and in amniotic fluid collected before and for 1 h after the [3H]MT injection. Two minutes after [3H]MT injection, radioactivity was detected in both maternal and fetal sheep plasma. Extraction of fetal plasma with chloroform indicated that [3H]MT accounted for 48.0 +/- 7.2 (SE) % of total radioactivity at 2 min after the injection. In one pregnant ewe infused with unlabeled MT (0.3 microgram/ml saline.min for 20 min) maternal and fetal plasma MT concentrations increased within 6 min after the start of the MT infusion. We conclude that there is a diurnal rhythm in the plasma concentrations of MT in the fetal lamb and pregnant ewe between 114 and 142 days gestation, and that MT crosses the ovine placenta from the maternal to the fetal circulation. Therefore, the MT present in the fetal sheep circulation may be solely of maternal origin or it may be derived from both fetal and maternal sources.\r"

  ".W": "GH exerts a number of metabolic effects on adipose tissue. Depending on the circumstances, it may increase or decrease glucose metabolism and lipolysis. These effects appear to be mediated by a single class of receptors, which bind GH with high affinity. Incubation of isolated rat adipocytes with a variety of lipolytic agents, including catecholamines, forskolin, or (Bu)2cAMP, decreased the specific binding of [125I]human (h) GH within 10 min. In the presence of 10 microM forskolin, GH binding declined to less than 20% of the control value within 50 min. Cholera and pertussis toxins, which increase cAMP secondary to ADP ribosylation of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins associated with hormone receptors, also decreased the binding of GH. None of these agents affected the rate of loss of cell-associated 125I when added to cells that had previously equilibrated with [125I]hGH. The inhibitory effects of forskolin and (Bu)2cAMP were at least as great when binding was measured in the presence of the protease inhibitor leupeptin, suggesting that increased rates of internalization and processing of bound hormone could not account for the decline in binding. Scatchard plots of data obtained in the presence of forskolin or (Bu)2cAMP were linear and parallel to control plots, indicating that the decline in binding could be accounted for by a decrease in the number of binding sites, with no change in affinity. To determine whether phosphorylation affected binding to receptors already present in the membrane or modified the turnover of receptors, we studied adipocyte ghosts, whose cellular apparatus for receptor turnover is disrupted. Incubation of adipocyte ghosts with cAMP-dependent protein kinase decreased the binding of [125I]hGH by 25%. The data suggest that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the GH receptor or a closely associated membrane protein renders the receptor incapable of binding GH.\r"

Whether these changes reflect altered synthesis or processing of POMC or altered expression of the POMC gene has not been established. We, therefore, measured POMC mRNA in hypothalami and pituitaries of young (7-month-old), middle-aged (15-month-old), and old (31-month-old) female mice, using slot blot hybridization of total RNA to riboprobes synthesized from cloned POMC DNA fragments. Concentrations of poly(A) and ribosomal RNA were also determined, using probes synthesized from poly(T) and a cloned ribosomal DNA fragment, respectively. Hypothalamic POMC mRNA content and concentration were 30% lower in old than in young and middle-aged mice (P less than 0.01). This change was not due to a general decline in hypothalamic mRNA or rRNA levels, neither of which changed with age. In contrast to the hypothalamus, the relative concentration of POMC mRNA in the pituitary nearly doubled in old mice (P less than 0.01). This increase was secondary to a decrease in other RNA species, however, since the total pituitary content of POMC mRNA did not differ between young and old mice. These results indicate that the regulation of POMC gene expression during aging differs in hypothalamus and pituitary, and that reduced levels of hypothalamic POMC mRNA may account for the previously reported reductions in concentrations of hypothalamic POMC peptides during aging.\r"

  ".W": "We have characterized the biological properties of two mutants of human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) which, as we have shown previously, have normal affinity for the type I IGF receptor, but drastically reduced affinity for the acid-stable components of human serum binding proteins. [Phe-1,Val1,Asn2,Gln3,His4,Ser8,His9,Glu12 ,Tyr15,Leu16]IGF I (B-chain mutant) and [Gln3,Ala4,Tyr15,Leu16]IGF I have 1000 and 500 times lower affinity than IGF-I for the native 150K binding protein in adult rat serum. Like IGF-I, these two peptides migrate as monomers during size exclusion chromatography on TSK 125. [125I]IGF-I, [125I]B-chain mutant, and [125I] [Gln3,Ala4,Tyr15,Leu16]IGF-I have in vivo serum half-lives of 100, 27.5, and 26.9 min, respectively, after iv injection. These data suggest that serum binding protein-bound peptide is cleared from the serum more slowly than free peptide. The tissue distributions of [125I]IGF-I and [125I]B-chain mutant are similar 10 min after dosing, with more than 80% of the tissue-sequestered intact radioactive peptides in the kidney. Despite decreased serum half-lives, the B-chain mutant and [Gln3,Ala4,Tyr15,Leu16]IGF-I are, respectively, 4 times and twice as active as IGF-I in stimulating the incorporation of [14C]glucose into glycogen in rat diaphragm in vivo. This effect of IGF-I is thought to be mediated by the type 1 IGF receptor in muscle, since the same doses of peptide that stimulated glycogen synthesis more than 30-fold did not stimulate the incorporation of [14C]glucose into total lipid in adipose tissue, an effect known to be mediated by the insulin receptor. These data support the hypothesis that serum- or tissue-derived binding proteins impair the ability of IGF-I to exert its effects through the type 1 IGF receptor in vivo.\r"

The CTP' band was much more apparent with urinary hCG from a patient with choriocarcinoma than with that from normal pregnant women. Second-dimensional electrophoresis of the choriocarcinoma hCG (c-hCG) after reduction with DTT indicated that the CTP', Mr 25,000, was released from the beta-subunit. The carbohydrate structure of the CTP' was analyzed by affinity with lectin-peroxidase on a nitrocellulose membrane. The CTP' did not interact with Concanavalin A, but exhibited strong interaction with both RCA120 and Arachis hypogaea after removal of sialic acid, indicating that it was released as a fragment containing an O-linked sugar chain as was found in the hCG beta carboxy-terminal portion. Western blot analysis using the antisera for hCG alpha, hCG beta, and hCG beta-CTP showed that the CTP' contains not only the carboxy-terminal portion but also a part of the internal (core) portion of the beta-subunit molecule. This dissociation of the c-hCG beta was further supported by the presence of a faster moving component (FMC) which may correspond to the NH2-terminal side counterpart. The desialylated FMC could be detected by Concanavalin A and RCA120 but not by Arachis hypogaea, indicating that it contains N-linked rather than O-linked sugar chains. The FMC does not contain any of the epitopes for the antisera examined in Western blot. These results indicate that the beta-subunit of the choriocarcinoma urine hCG has an unusual site which is dissociated into two components of Mr 25,000 (CTP') and Mr 18,000 (FMC) by DTT reduction.\r"

  ".W": "To study the role of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in mediating the growth-promoting function of GH, IGF-I expression was assayed in transgenic mice carrying either GH or GRF fusion genes. These mice exhibit enhanced growth as a result of high level ectopic expression of GH and have 2-fold elevation of both hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels and circulating IGF-I levels. Hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels are low at birth regardless of GH levels; they increase approximately 10-fold during postnatal development and become GH inducible 2 weeks after birth. The ontogeny of circulating IGF-I is similar. Accelerated growth in transgenic mice with GH fusion genes commences 3 weeks after birth despite high circulating GH levels at least as early as birth. In addition, endogenous mouse GH-secreting somatotroph cells in the pituitary are present in normal numbers at 3 weeks, but are undetectable 4 weeks after birth. Because the time at which IGF-I expression becomes GH responsive slightly precedes both the initiation of accelerated growth and the time when endogenous GH disappears, we conclude that IGF-I is directly involved in mediating the GH signal and that delayed induction of IGF-I gene expression is responsible, at least in part, for the delayed onset of other GH-responsive events.\r"

Addition of IAP to medium caused a biphasic effect on oPRL-stimulated cell number. Low doses (10(-3) ng/ml) enhanced (mean +/- SEM, 15 +/- 3%) whereas higher doses (greater than or equal to 10 ng/ml) inhibited (24 +/- 3%) mitogenesis stimulated by a submaximal dose of oPRL (0.1 ng/ml) compared to control values. The cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP also had a biphasic effect on cell division stimulated by submaximal doses of PRL. Low doses (10(-5) M) enhanced whereas higher doses (10(-3) M) inhibited Nb2 cell growth in response to PRL. Incubation with CT only inhibited oPRL-stimulated mitogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal inhibition (63 +/- 7%) occurred at a concentration of 10 ng/ml or more. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) enhanced mitogenesis stimulated by PRL alone and in the presence of either stimulatory or inhibitory doses of IAP, but PMA did not block IAP inhibition. In contrast, PMA had no effect on cells incubated with CT; the inhibition of PRL-stimulated cell division by CT remained unchanged. Lactogenic receptor-binding sites per cell and affinity were not significantly affected by PMA, IAP, or CT, suggesting a postreceptor mechanism of action. In summary, these data demonstrate that cAMP modifies PRL-stimulated Nb2 cell mitogenesis. The differences between IAP and CT (i.e. biphasic effect, degree of inhibition, and differential effect of PMA) suggest that these agents could also modulate PRL actions in the Nb2 cell through different mechanisms, including a cAMP-independent pathway.\r"

  ".U": "88254658\r", 
  ".W": "Although the somatomedins are believed to mediate GH-induced somatic growth, circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) do not always correlate with growth rate. To evaluate a paracrine or autocrine effect that might explain this discordance, the concentrations of plasma and tissue IGF-I were compared with indices of growth in hypophysectomized rats treated with rat GH (rGH). The rats received a total of 250 micrograms rGH by either continuous pump infusion (P) or twice daily injections (I). After 4 days of treatment, the amounts of IGF-I present in acetic acid extracts of liver and kidney and in native serum were determined by RIA and related to proximal tibial epiphyseal plate width. Tibial epiphyseal plate width increased from 198 +/- 6 microns (mean +/- SE) in untreated controls to 339 +/- 13 microns in group P and 347 +/- 9 micron in group I; weight gain was 11.6 +/- 1.0 g in group P and 9.6 +/- 0.8 g in group I, while control animals lost 1.0 g. Serum concentrations of IGF-I were no different between control animals and those in the injection group (0.91 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.90 +/- 0.06 U/ml), whereas levels in the infusion group increased slightly (1.1 +/- 0.05 U/ml). In contrast, rGH administration caused tissue IGF-I to double in liver (control, 0.24 +/- 0.04 U/g; P, 0.51 +/- 0.03 U/g; I, 0.46 +/- 0.05 U/g) and nearly triple in kidney (control, 0.52 +/- 0.05 U/g; P, 1.51 +/- 0.09 U/g; I, 1.36 +/- 0.08 U/g). There was no detectable change in somatomedin-binding protein by gel exclusion chromatography. Since the rGH administered was sufficient to stimulate growth and increase tissue somatomedin levels without corresponding increases in circulating IGF-I, an autocrine or paracrine action of IGF-I appears to mediate GH's initial somatogenic actions in the young rat.\r"

  ".W": "To examine further the relationship between developmental changes in LH release and the onset of puberty, effects of posterior hypothalamic lesions were tested in ovariectomized (OVX), sexually immature female monkeys. In OVX females (n = 3) with sham hypothalamic lesions basal LH levels were suppressed during the prepubertal period until 25 months of age, when LH levels started to increase. The increase in basal LH continued; a 100% elevation from prepubertal levels was attained at 26.0 +/- 0 months of age, and a 200% elevation was attained at 31.0 +/- 3.2 months of age. A consistent appearance of LH circadian fluctuation (nocturnal LH increase) with a large amplitude accompanied the initial LH increase. Lesions of the posterior hypothalamus (PH) in OVX animals (n = 6) at 17-18 months of age, which we previously reported to be effective in advancing the onset of puberty by several months in ovarian intact monkeys, resulted in an early 100% increase in basal LH levels and the circadian LH fluctuation (19.5 +/- 1.0 months of age). Basal LH levels in these animals further increased, reaching a 200% elevation of prelesion levels at 24.2 +/- 0.7 months of age. All of these LH changes with PH lesions occurred significantly (P less than 0.01) earlier than those in sham-lesioned animals. Lesion of the PH in OVX animals (n = 4) at 13-14 months of age resulted in an increase in LH and the circadian LH fluctuation within 1 month postoperatively. However, 100% and 200% LH elevations did not occur until 20.8 +/- 1.0 and 24.8 +/- 1.4 months of age, respectively. These ages were similar to those of animals receiving lesions at 17-18 months of age, but much younger than those of sham controls (P less than 0.01). PH lesions in animals at 13-14 months of age also advanced the time of the first positive feedback effects of estrogen. In animals (n = 4) with PH lesions, estradiol benzoate induced a first LH response at 21.5 +/- 1.6 months of age, when basal LH was 276 +/- 83% increased from prelesion levels. This age was significantly (P less than 0.05) younger than that (29.3 +/- 1.9 months; n = 6) of the first LH surge induced by estrogen in control animals when basal LH levels attained 248 +/- 18% of prepubertal levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These same synthetic alpha-subunit peptides, the sequences of which are common to all human glycoprotein hormones, were found to inhibit the binding of [125I]iodo-TSH to human thyroid membrane preparations and FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells. The active portions of the subunit were represented in synthetic peptides alpha 21-35, alpha 31-45, alpha 26-46, and alpha 81-92, indicating that 2 separate sites within the alpha-subunit have binding activity for TSH. Peptides alpha 26-46 and alpha 31-45 were also found to potently inhibit the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by bovine TSH in TSH bioassay using FRTL-5 cells. Seven other synthetic peptides, including the remainder of the 92-amino acid sequence of the alpha-subunit, demonstrated little or no ability to inhibit binding of the tracer or inhibit the bioactivity of intact TSH. The findings were very similar to those of previous studies involving hCG binding, except that the two active sites appeared to be somewhat shifted towards the COOH-terminal end of the subunit. These studies support the concept of the importance of the alpha-subunit in receptor binding of all glycoprotein hormones and demonstrate the utility of the overlapping synthetic peptide strategy in investigations of protein structure-function relationships.\r"

Latency to the first posttreatment milk ejection and posttreatment milk ejection intervals and pressure wave amplitudes were compared between THC- and vehicle-treated rats. Before treatment, intervals between milk ejections averaged 6.5 +/- 1.3 (+/- SE) and 7.0 +/- 0.7 min for vehicle- and THC-treated groups, respectively. Vehicle injections did not alter the frequency of milk ejections, which continued at an overall mean interval of 7.6 +/- 0.7 min after treatment. In contrast, THC treatment was followed by a transient suspension of milk ejections, with a latency of 59.3 +/- 7.4 min before the first posttreatment milk ejection was recorded (P less than 0.001). Intervals between subsequent ejections averaged 15.3 +/- 2.0 to 16.1 +/- 1.3 min and were lengthened relative to corresponding intervals in vehicle-treated animals (P less than 0.05). The amplitudes of pressure waves were not significantly affected by treatment. Oxytocin (0.5 mU) injections 10 or 30 min after THC treatment evoked abrupt increases in intramammary pressure, indicating continued responsiveness of the mammary gland to oxytocin stimulation. These data suggest that THC interferes with the release of oxytocin in response to suckling. To our knowledge, this provides the first evidence that THC inhibits posterior pituitary function.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported no difference in progesterone (P4) secretion from the granulosa layer of the largest follicle (F1) of the domestic hen regardless of the maturity of the F1 follicle. However, coincubation of the granulosa and thecal layers resulted in inhibition of P4 secretion from the less mature F1, but not from the more mature F1. The goal of this study was to determine if estradiol (E2) and androgens secreted by the thecal layer suppress P4 production by the granulosa cells. We removed the granulosa layer from less mature F1 follicles and dispersed granulosa cells (1 x 10(5)) were incubated (3 h) in triplicate with one of these treatments: control, E2, testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT; at concentrations of 1 x 10(-7), 1 x 10(-6), and 1 x 10(-5) M), LH (100 ng) as well as LH plus E2, T, A, and DHT at the same concentrations. P4 secretion was measured in the medium and cells, and the experiment was replicated seven times. We found a dose-related suppression of basal and LH-stimulated P4 production by all steroids. In a second experiment (n = 3-5), we tested the specificity of the androgens in suppressing P4 production by granulosa cells by using the aromatase inhibitor 7-(4'-amino)phenylthio-4-androstene-3,17-dione. This compound did not reduce the effectiveness of T in suppressing P4 production. Finally in Exp 3 (n = 4-7), E2 and T were tested individually and in combination at concentrations of 1 X 10(-8)-1 X 10(-5) M. We found a possible synergistic effect, in that the combination of E2 plus T suppressed P4 to a greater degree than either steroid alone. Our results indicate that 1) E2 and androgens suppress basal and LH-stimulated P4 production by granulosa cells in a dose-related manner; 2) androgen suppression of P4 production is not mediated by aromatization to estrogen; and 3) the suppressive effects of E2 and androgens may be synergistic. We conclude that E2 and androgens secreted by the thecal layer may regulate P4 production by the granulosa layer.\r"

There was no significant difference among total thyroid weights removed by sub-tx, but thyroid remnant weights and TSH levels were higher at death (6 weeks after sub-tx) in LIG than in MIG and HIG. Total specific activities of cathepsin D and of arylsulfatase A in the sedimentable and nonsedimentable subcellular fractions were at least 38% lower in LIG than in MIG and HIG. The ratio between relative follicular volume and colloid volume determined by morphometry was higher in LIG than in MIG and lower in HIG than in MIG. Ultrastructurally, the relative volume occupied by secondary lysosomes was higher in HIG than in MIG, whereas the number of secondary lysosomes was not higher in LIG than in controls. Autoradiographic studies with 125I revealed that a large part of the radioactivity was in thyroid cell secondary lysosomes in MIG and HIG when radioiodine was injected 3 weeks before death. It is concluded that after sub-tx, iodine 1) regulates the weight of thyroid remnants, perhaps only indirectly through TSH, 2) modulates the number of secondary lysosomes in thyroid cells, and 3) slows down the turnover of secondary lysosomes. An iodine-deficient regimen impedes the secondary lysosomes to increase. Because of these findings, we postulate that chronic TSH stimulation along with a possible toxic role of iodine after sub-tx could induce an accumulation of lysosomal bodies.\r"

  ".W": "Several blood proteins have been associated with the transport of vitamin D sterols. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin or absorbed from the intestine, and there is evidence for different rates of transfer to the liver from these sources. To evaluate the influences of various plasma proteins on the hepatic accumulation of vitamin D3, human plasma albumin, D-binding protein, chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein were isolated and incubated with [3H]vitamin D3 before single-pass perfusions of the isolated, vitamin D-deficient rat liver. Hepatic uptake of sterol was greatest when vitamin D3 was presented on LDL or chylomicron remnants, whereas D-binding protein permitted the least uptake. Silicic acid chromatography revealed greater amounts of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 when substrate was presented on carriers known to have hepatic receptors. After iv administration of tracer amounts of vitamin D3 to fasting rats, gradient gel electrophoretic analyses of plasma revealed most of the [3H] associated with the vitamin D-binding protein, and smaller amounts associated with LDL and high density lipoprotein. Our results suggest a major role for chylomicron remnants in the hepatic presentation of ingested vitamin D3 and support the possibility that hepatic delivery from cutaneous sites may involve lipoprotein carriers.\r"

Ligand binding characteristics were similar for ACE derived from testis, lung, and kidney, despite known differences in structure between ACe from these sources. This observation suggests that the ACE active enzymatic site is similar in different tissues. The effect of the orally active ACE inhibitor perindopril was studied ex vivo in tissues of the rat after oral gavage. Radioligand bound to tissue ACE was reduced after perindopril treatment, in tissue homogenates of lung and kidney, but not testis. Autoradiographs of radioligand binding to tissue sections obtained ex vivo after oral perindopril showed inhibition of ACE in the aorta, lung, and kidney, but did not reveal any inhibition of ACE in the testis. ACE in small vessels of the testis was inhibited as in the aorta, while at the same time testicular ACE was unaffected. ACE in rat testis appears to have a similar enzymatic binding site to ACE from the lung and kidney. Perindopril inhibited ACE in the lung and kidney but did not affect ACE in the testis, suggesting the drug is limited in testicular penetration by the blood-testis barrier. This may explain the lack of any reports of adverse effects of ACE inhibitors on testicular function.\r"

  ".W": "Down-regulation of hCG receptors and a steroidogenic lesion in progesterone production were observed in isolated luteal cells after 24-h treatment of pseudopregnant rats with 50 IU hCG. The luteal cells from hCG-desensitized rats exhibited a complete loss of steroidogenic response to lipoproteins in both the absence and presence of hCG. This loss of response was not overcome by the addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol. To examine if the loss of steroidogenic response is due to a transient loss of steroidogenic enzymes or inadequate delivery of substrate cholesterol, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) activity was measured in the isolated mitochondria. No differences appeared in enzyme activity between control and hCG-treated groups. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of mitochondrial cytochrome P450scc from control and hCG-treated groups exhibited no appreciable differences in low spin electron paramagnetic resonance signal (g = 1.9, 2.2, and 2.4) or high spin EPR signal (g = 8.2), suggesting that the binding of the substrate to P450scc was not impaired. Additionally, the iron sulfur protein signal (g = 1.95 and 2.03) of the reduced mitochondria remained unchanged in the desensitized group. These data were supported by immunoblotting analysis which revealed no difference in the relative amounts of iron sulfur protein or cytochrome P450scc between the two groups. Moreover, the inner mitochondrial membranes, the locus of cytochrome P450scc, showed an identical cholesterol content in control and desensitized mitochondria, indicating that the availability of cholesterol substrate is not impaired during desensitization. These results suggest that the intramitochondrial transfer of cholesterol and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme activity are unaffected in the desensitized state, but an inhibitory substance might be responsible for the lack of steroidogenic response.\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors with catecholamines leads to desensitization of their ability to activate cAMP accumulation. However, little is known about the relationship between these changes and possible alterations in physiological responses. We have used isolated adipocytes prepared from NEDH rats harboring pheochromocytomas, a norepinephrine-secreting tumor, to address this question. As expected, there was a decrease in the ability of isoproterenol to maximally activate cAMP accumulation in adipocytes from rat harboring pheochromocytoma [323 +/- 107 vs. 707 +/- 145 pmol/10(5) cells.min (mean +/- SD) in controls]. This change was associated with an increase in the EC50 of isoproterenol for activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (5.8 X 10(-8) vs. 2.4 X 10(-8) M in controls) and a decrease in maximal activation of the kinase (38 +/- 16% vs. 77 +/- 14% in controls). For lipolysis there was a loss in sensitivity to isoproterenol but no change in maximal lipolytic rate in the adipocytes from rats harboring pheochromocytoma. For both groups there was a similar relationship between kinase activation and lipolysis; maximal lipolysis had already occurred for protein kinase-A activity ratios less than 30%. Therefore, the blunted cAMP response in adipocytes from rats harboring pheochromocytoma did not impair the maximal lipolytic rate. These results demonstrate that adipocytes can efficiently maintain maximal lipolysis in a desensitized state because of considerable reserve in the biochemical cascade leading to the lipolytic response. In addition, our findings demonstrate that there are no regulatory changes induced by prolonged exposure to catecholamines that are distal to cAMP accumulation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the anti-estrogen Tamoxifen (Tx) on membrane electrical properties and the underlying calcium (Ca2+) conductances was examined in the clonal pituitary cell line GH3/B6 which exhibits calcium action potentials at rest. Electrophysiological recordings (109 cells) were made using either high resistance intracellular microelectrodes or the whole-cell recording (WCR) patch-clamp technique. Electrical activities of 39 spontaneously active GH3/B6 cells were recorded with sharp microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl. The spikes were Ca2+-dependent since they were blocked by Cobalt ions (Co2+, 5 mM). When applied directly to the recorded cell, Tx (10(-7) M) inhibited action potential firing. This blockade was accompanied by a discrete hyperpolarization of the membrane potential (-2.8 +/- 2 m V) from rest (-39.5 +/- 5 m V) and a 10% increase in the input membrane resistance. The effect stopped soon after Tx removal (mean 11.4 +/- 6 sec), and Tx solvent was unable to elicit the response. Current clamp WCR with pipettes containing potassium gluconate (KGlu, 140 mM) confirmed these results (30 cells), but the addition of cell extract to KGlu was necessary to prevent rundown of the response and to obtain reproducible action potential blockade. Short (1-5 min) or long term (48 h) pretreatment with estradiol (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) did not change the response to Tx, thus indicating that its effect was not mediated through estrogen receptors. Voltage clamp WCR study of the effect of Tx (10(-7) M) using pipettes filled with cesium chloride (140 mM) showed that both fast and slow inactivating calcium conductances were inhibited (38 cells). The fast inactivating Ca2+ current was reduced by about 60-80% whereas slow inactivating Ca2+ current was completely inhibited. This action may represent one way by which the antitumoral effect of this antiestrogen is mediated.\r"

  ".W": "FRTL-5 thyroid epithelial cells in culture were used to study the possible inhibitory effects of iodine on thyroid growth. NaI exerted a dose-dependent, thyroid epithelial cell-specific inhibitory effect on [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, reduced the DNA content in the cell layer, and limited the increase in cell number mediated by TSH. The inhibitory effects of sodium iodide applied to growth stimulated by TSH-, cAMP-, and non-cAMP-dependent mechanisms and were prevented by 1-methylimidazole-2-thiol (methimazole) and 2-ethylthioisonicotinamide (ethionamide). The latter findings indicate that the inhibitory effects of NaI are mediated by some iodine-containing organic compound. The inhibitory effects of organic iodine on growth subsided 24-48 h after removal of excess NaI from the culture medium. In contrast, NaI had no effect on normal rat kidney fibroblast or thyroid fibroblast [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation stimulated by epidermal growth factor or serum. These data demonstrate a specific inhibitory effect of organic iodine on thyroid epithelial cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine the effect of estradiol and progesterone on the synthesis of oviduct-specific proteins and to determine if there were changes in the synthesis of these proteins in different regions of the oviduct. Ovariectomized females were either untreated, treated with estradiol for 7 or 14 days, or primed with estradiol for 14 days and then treated with estradiol plus progesterone or progesterone alone for either 7 or 14 days. Oviducts were incubated in the presence of labeled methionine or glucosamine for 24 h at 37 C, and the culture medium was then analyzed by one- and two-dimensional (2-D) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by fluorography. A family of macromolecules [mol wt (Mr), 100,000-130,000] was only present in the animals treated with estradiol for 7 or 14 days. 2-D analysis demonstrated that two proteins, one basic and one acidic, were the major estradiol-responsive proteins in the 100,000-130,000 Mr region. In addition, an acidic protein in this region increased in intensity with estradiol treatment. All three proteins incorporated methionine and glucosamine. Since a steroid-responsive gradient is known to exist in the oviduct, oviducts were divided into fimbria, ampulla, and isthmic regions and cultured separately. 2-D analysis of the medium indicated that the ampulla synthesized both the acidic (Mr, 100,000-120,000) and basic (Mr, 120,000-130,000) proteins, whereas the acidic protein was dominant in the fimbria and the basic protein was dominant in the isthmus. Another acidic protein (Mr, 110,000) was only present in the fimbria and ampulla. This study clearly demonstrates that the estradiol-treated baboon oviduct synthesizes several proteins that were not detectable in the ovariectomized or progesterone-treated animal. Also, the different regions of the oviduct have different synthetic capabilities for these proteins. The electrophoretic characteristics of these proteins are similar to those we have observed at midcycle in the intact baboon and human oviduct.\r"

Unlike in the pituitary, only basic FGF appears to be present in human placenta. The purification of these growth factors from bovine pituitary and human placenta has been described. Immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies specific for either basic FGF or both acidic and basic FGF have verified the results of purification. We have determined a novel function of acidic and basic FGF in the maturation of porcine granulosa cells in vitro. Basic FGF (1.0 ng/ml), purified from bovine pituitary functioned as a potent inhibitor of LH/hCG receptor induction (91 +/- 1.2%; P less than 0.0001), and progesterone secretion (45 +/- 2.9%; P less than 0.0001), two key steps in the maturation of granulosa cells. Human placental basic FGF demonstrated comparable inhibition characteristics. Bovine pituitary acidic FGF (50 ng/ml) appear to function as a relatively weak inhibitor (63.5 +/- 5.1% for LH/hCG receptor induction; 50 +/- 1.8% for progesterone secretion). Consequently, our analysis indicates that FGF may play an important role(s) in the maturation of ovarian granulosa cells.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroglobulin from colloid as well as from membrane fractions became radiolabeled upon incubation of calf thyroid slices with [35S]sulfate. The identity of the sulfate-labeled molecule was established by immunoprecipitation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Bio-Gel A-5m filtration, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Size analysis by gel filtration of [35S]glycopeptides and hydrazine-released oligosaccharides indicated that the sulfate was primarily located in the complex (unit B) carbohydrate units of thyroglobulin. Moreover, although [35S]sulfate-labeled oligosaccharides were cleaved by N-glycanase to the same extent as those labeled with [3H]mannose, they were not released by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase under conditions that led to the complete removal of polymannose carbohydrate (unit A). The failure of 35S-labeled glycopeptides and oligosaccharides to bind to immobilized Concanavalin-A indicated that the sulfate residues in calf thyroglobulin are located in carbohydrate units with three or more branches. No evidence for the occurrence of tyrosine sulfate was found upon examination of Pronase digests of radiolabeled thyroglobulin, and chemical analyses excluded the presence of this amino acid down to a level of 0.5 residues/polypeptide subunit. Studies with density gradient-separated membrane fractions as well as with puromycin indicated that sulfate addition is a late event in thyroglobulin biosynthesis which occurs in the Golgi compartment. Furthermore, it was observed that the nondimerized thyroglobulin subunit was much less sulfate labeled than the mature molecule. The location of the sulfated carbohydrate in a terminal portion of the calf thyroglobulin peptide chain was suggested by the observation that the subunit [mol wt (Mr) = 330,000] can undergo a transformation, presumably mediated by an endogenous protease, to a sulfate-free component (Mr = approximately 270,000) with the appearance of a 35S-labeled 60,000 Mr fragment; the release of a single sulfate-labeled peptide (Mr = 60,000) by mild trypsin treatment was consistent with a sequestration of sulfate groups in the thyroglobulin molecule.\r"
