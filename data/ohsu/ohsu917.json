Increasing emphasis is being placed upon nutrition as a therapeutic tool to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cancer. Adequate nutrition should be a concern for all health care workers because of its impact on the overall health of patients. Health care professionals should be familiar with the essentials of nutritional assessment and basic nutritional requirements and be able to improve their patients' care in the face of nutritional deficiencies or excesses.\r"

The easily portable equipment enabled patients' swallowing ability to be tested, at the bedside if necessary, using a small amount of fruit-flavored drink. The results appear in chart form. EDAT findings from groups of normal subjects aged 2-90 years were compared with those from patients with dysphagia of neurologic origin and normal subjects under experimental feeding conditions. The results revealed maturation of the feeding respiratory pattern in the teenage years and remarkable consistency thereafter. Differences in the recordings between the normal and abnormal subjects were sufficiently marked to allow the findings to be used in the diagnosis of other patients with dysphagia of doubtful neurologic cause. Interpretation of the charts and recorded timings of the oral and pharyngeal stages of swallowing permitted a more accurate identification of sensory nerve, motor nerve, and functional involvement causing dysphagia of neurologic origin and may be used as a guide to the origin of the sensory deficit.\r"

Nine durational measures of the swallow were evaluated. There were no statistically significant differences for any of the measures between the initial test and a retest conducted days later. The findings suggest that, on the whole, normal subjects perform similarly on test and a retest. However, the variability displayed by these normal subjects may be clinically significant, indicating that test-retest swallowing duration measures require careful interpretation.\r"

Anesthesia was discontinued on day 14, and the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation on day 16. Over the next two months, the neuromuscular impairment markedly improved. Halothane was associated with cardiac arrhythmias and hepatitis necessitating replacement by enflurane. Enflurane appeared to be as effective a treatment for refractory asthma as halothane. The most probable cause of the neuromuscular impairment in our patient was the long-term use of inhalation anesthetics or nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.\r"

A wedge resection of the tumor was done. Tumor cells were characterized by strongly eosinophilic granular cytoplasm on light microscopy and by numerous closely packed round or ovoid mitochondria with prominent tubular cristae on electron microscopy. They were arranged in a sheet around small vessels, as a result of which the biopsy diagnosis of oncocytoma was changed to oncocytic glomus tumor.

Cyclosporine suppressed conventional markers of inflammation and there was clinical improvement in one patient, but the disease recurred when therapy was discontinued. The second patient who had diabetes mellitus developed unstable glucose metabolism when given cyclosporine. This unstable diabetes mellitus together with side effects of nausea and vomiting resulted in weight loss and inadequate serum therapeutic levels that was associated with a poor therapeutic response to the cyclosporine. The major side effects in both patients were headache and gastrointestinal symptoms, but there was no renal dysfunction. We conclude that while corticosteroids remain the mainstay of sarcoid therapy, when these drugs have not been successful for the skin manifestations of the disease, a trial of cyclosporine may be justified.\r"

Five with extracardiopulmonary disease were used as controls. The weight of the right ventricle was significantly increased in CPD when compared to control subjects. Walls of both ventricles were significantly thicker in CPD. Myocyte diameters of both ventricles were significantly greater in CPD. The percentage of fibrosis in the right ventricle was significantly greater in CPD. The percentage of fibrosis in the left ventricle was significantly greater only in patients with right ventricular hypertrophy. We concluded that the left ventricle was also involved pathologically in patients with chronic cor pulmonale in the end stage of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Pneumocystis carinii (PC) has been recognized as frequently responsible for most opportunistic pulmonary infections occurring in immunocompromised AIDS and non-AIDS patients. Moreover, these patients can be considered at risk for secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Therefore, we have investigated the occurrence of associated secondary alveolar proteinosis and PC pneumonitis in AIDS and non-AIDS immunocompromised patients. In a series of 26 bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) in patients with PC pneumonitis (19 AIDS and seven non-AIDS patients), we observed on light microscopy, in addition to the honeycombed material, areas of an extracellular material that had a different pattern which was suggestive of that described in alveolar proteinosis. A systematic ultrastructural study of these 26 BAL fluid samples demonstrated in each of them an accumulation of phospholipid surfactantlike extracellular material mixed or not with the PC cysts. In nine cases, the observation of lipoproteinaceous material on light microscopy and abundant phospholipid material with myelinlike and myelin tubular laminated structures on electron microscopy was highly suggestive of an associated pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). Such an accumulation of extracellular material was not observed in the 11 BAL fluid samples collected in immunocompromised patients (seven AIDS and four non-AIDS patients) without PC pneumonitis. These findings demonstrated a particular frequency of associated PAP with PC pneumonitis. These results raise important questions concerning (1) the consequence of such an alveolar accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material on the clinical status and prognosis of the pneumonitis, and (2) the mechanisms responsible for this accumulation.\r"

Thirty-two men with documented CAD who complained of frequent and usually daily retrosternal chest pain were evaluated. Following a standard esophageal manometry and acid perfusion test, simultaneous two-channel ambulatory Holter monitor and esophageal pH record tests were performed for 24 hours. Fifty-three episodes of chest pain were documented in 20 patients; 11 patients were free of pain. Of the 20 patients who complained of chest pains, 17 (85 percent) demonstrated at least one episode of PPR, defined as a drop in distal esophageal pH to less than 4 within ten minutes before or after the onset chest pain. Episodes of asymptomatic GER were common. The correlation of PPR with chest pain was 70 percent (37/53 episodes) and of ischemic ECG changes with chest pain 13 percent (7/53); in the remaining, there was no correlation with either. Two patients demonstrated simultaneous PPR and ischemic ECG changes. Seventeen esophageal motility abnormalities were observed in 14 patients (45 percent). It is our conclusion that esophageal disorders contribute to chest pain in patients with documented CAD. In this group, GER plays a greater role than in those with normal coronary arteries. In addition, esophageal motility disorders are common in these patients. Esophageal testing can be undertaken safely in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Salbutamol (Albuterol) and diuretics are commonly prescribed together in patients with airflow obstruction and are associated with electrocardiographic effects. We have now investigated whether the use of potassium-sparing drugs might prevent the ECG sequelae of such combined therapy. Ten healthy subjects received seven days of randomized treatments with: placebo, bendrofluazide (5 mg), bendrofluazide plus triamterene 50 mg (conventional dose), or triamterene 200 mg (high dose), and bendrofluazide plus spironolactone (100 mg). Potassium and ECG responses to inhaled salbutamol, 2 mg, were measured after each treatment period. The T-wave flattening in response to bendrofluazide and salbutamol (0.24[CI, 0.19 to 0.29]mV) was attenuated by the addition of triamterene, 200 mg (0.33[CI, 0.28 to 0.37]mV; p less than 0.05) and spironolactone 100 mg (0.42[CI, 0.37 to 0.47]mV; p less than 0.01), but not by triamterene 50 mg (0.25[CI, 0.20 to 0.30]mV). Spironolactone and high dose triamterene also diminished the frequency of U waves and ST depression. The ECG effects mirrored hypokalemic responses which were also blunted by high dose (p less than 0.01) but not low dose triamterene, as well as by spironolactone (p less than 0.001). Thus, the use of high dose triamterene and spironolactone protected against the hypokalemic and ECG sequelae of combined beta-agonist/diuretic therapy, whereas a conventional dose of triamterene had no effect. These findings may be important in the prevention of a potentially dangerous interaction in susceptible patients taking this combination of drugs.\r"

Of 315 patients evaluated for potential cardiac transplantation at UCLA, 132 underwent pulmonary function tests. The latter patients had severe heart failure with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 19 percent and mean cardiac index of 2.1 L/min/m2. Diffusion impairment either alone or combined with restrictive and/or obstructive ventilatory defects occurred in 67 percent of the patients evaluated. Diffusion impairment occurred as the sole abnormality in 31 percent of the patients and in combination with a restrictive ventilatory defect in 21 percent. A reduction in diffusing capacity has not been previously described as a frequent finding in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. In contrast to other studies involving patients with acute heart failure, obstructive ventilatory defects were uncommon. None of the lung function abnormalities was associated with smoking status, prior drug use, chest roentgenographic changes, hemodynamic findings, or clinical features, including duration of congestive heart failure. The mechanism for the diffusion impairment is unclear but could be due to chronic passive congestion with pulmonary fibrosis and/or recurrent pulmonary emboli. Recognition of diffusion impairment as a common finding in patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure who are candidates for heart transplantation is important for proper interpretation of possible post-transplant changes in diffusing capacity due to other causes.\r"

One in two first received a diagnosis of asthma ten or more years previously. Common comorbidities were hypertension, obesity, rhinitis, bronchitis, sinusitis, and arthritis. One half had visited an emergency room or been hospitalized for asthma in the past year. Inhaled bronchodilators and continuous theophylline were the most commonly prescribed medications. Side effects, especially tachycardia and insomnia, were common and almost exclusively associated with theophylline or corticosteroid therapy. Spirometric assessment showed chronic airflow obstruction in those with more severe asthma. Prevalence of respiratory symptoms, intensity of medication regimen, incidence of side effects, and health care utilization increased as asthma severity increased.\r"

In the responders, the decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance following nifedipine was 23 percent at rest (p less than 0.0005) and 35 percent during exercise (p less than 0.0005); following diltiazem, it was 10 percent at rest (p less than 0.05) and 23 percent during exercise (p less than 0.025); following verapamil, it was 22 percent at rest (p less than 0.005) and 11 percent during exercise (p less than 0.025). The cardiac index rose significantly at rest and under exercise only after the administration of nifedipine (+16 percent and +8 percent, resp). Nifedipine caused the most distinctive peripheral vasodilation. The heart rate increased slightly following nifedipine and decreased slightly following diltiazem and verapamil. After long-term therapy with nifedipine (13 +/- 5 months), the decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance was no longer significant. In our opinion, the different hemodynamic action profiles will have consequences for the differential therapy in patients with COPD and pulmonary hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "In forty-one patients (mean [+/- SD] age 51 +/- 19 years; range, 11 to 88 years; seven female and 34 male) with clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia, we performed a nonfluoroscopic percutaneous lung needle (22 gauges) aspiration (PLNA) to investigate the diagnostic yield of this technique. All the patients were receiving antibiotics at the time of the study, and PLNA was performed either because of a lack of response to empiric antibiotic treatment or because of the severity of the pneumonia or the underlying condition of the patient. Eight patients were mechanically ventilated (MV) due to acute respiratory failure. The PLNA was performed at bedside and without fluoroscopic guidance. Twenty-two microorganisms were identified by means of stains and/or cultures of PLNA samples. Sensitivity of PLNA was 43 percent (18/41). We detected three false-positive cultures probably due to contamination from the skin area punctured. In the eight MV patients studied, the sensitivity of PLNA was 37.5 percent, and the microbiologic findings turned out to be crucial for the outcome of the patients. Pneumothorax developed in three patients (7 percent) after PLNA. None of these three patients developed a pleural infection but two of them required thoracostomy drainage. None of the MV patients presented complications. Our results showed that nonfluoroscopic PLNA is a technique with moderately good sensitivity and with a low rate of false-positive cultures (8 percent) to diagnose pulmonary infections in patients with unresponsiveness to empiric antibiotic treatment or with severe pneumonia. Further evaluation of its diagnostic value and complications in MV patients is needed, although our preliminary results suggest that PLNA can be an alternative technique to other methods for diagnosing pulmonary infections in patients receiving artificial ventilatory support.\r"

No differences were noted between T and N visits with respect to clinical findings, laboratory results and other forms of therapy.

At 48 h, the cumulative relapse rate for T visits (8.9 percent) was significantly lower than for N visits (33.3 percent; p = 0.005).

The bronchospasmolytic effect of 12 micrograms of formoterol was compared with that of 200 micrograms of albuterol (salbutamol) in a single-center, double-blind, randomized within-patient study. The drugs were given as aerosols by MDI to 16 patients with nocturnal asthma in a stable phase. The inhalations were given at 10 PM and the FEV1 values as parameter were measured before and at 1, 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours afterwards. The FEV1 6 hours after administration of formoterol was significantly higher than that after albuterol (ANCOVA: p = 0.008), and this was still the case 12 hours after the test dose at 10 AM the following morning (ANCOVA: p = 0.009). At 4 AM, the FEV1 fell below the basic starting value after albuterol, whereas it remained at least 10 percent above the formoterol inhalation. Five patients required rescue therapy after albuterol and two after formoterol. We conclude that formoterol in a dose of 12 micrograms via MDI confers good protection against nocturnal asthma; this was only insufficient for some patients with severe asthma, and further studies with higher dosages in these patients are clearly indicated.\r"

Giant cell arteritis involvement of the aortic root was confirmed. The second patient developed aortic regurgitation seven years after pathologic documentation of giant cell arteries of the temporal arteries. Although pathologic confirmation of the aortic root process was not obtained, this case strengthens the clinical association between giant cell arteritis of the temporal arteries and subsequent aortic root dilatation and severe aortic regurgitation. Observation for signs of de novo severe aortic regurgitation is indicated in follow-up of patients with temporal arteritis.\r"

Pulmonary physicians used the terms \"crackles\" and \"rales\" with equal frequency to describe discontinuous adventitious lung sounds (ALS) and not at all to describe continuous ALS. Other physicians preferred the term \"rales\" in describing discontinuous ALS. The terms \"wheeze\" and \"stridor\" were used only in describing continuous ALS; however, the term \"rhonchi\" was frequently used to describe continuous and discontinuous ALS. The majority of participants recognized the normal breath sounds but not the pleural friction rub. Most did not use a qualifying adjective to describe ALS, and there was little agreement among those who did. The lung sound terminology used by physicians is not well standardized and the recommendations of the ATS/ACCP nomenclature subcommittee are not widely accepted.\r"

Of the nine patients who experienced poor results, one was noncompliant in operating the shunt and eight had occluded shunts. In the 30 patients, who were compliant and had adequate length of follow-up, five had excellent results, 12 had good results, and five had fair results. Two of the patients with occluded shunts had good results after shunt revision; 24 patients had some symptomatic relief with shunting. Evaluation of factors including a history of prior abdominal surgery, performance status, and pleural fluid cell counts, differential, chemistries, and cytology revealed no significant differences between the patients who experienced shunt failure and those who had patent shunts. Shunting of pleural effusions is well tolerated and has good success rates in properly selected patients.\r"

Pulmonary function (FEV1, IVC) and respiratory symptoms were assessed. The results indicated that patients were more impaired in their physical and psychosocial functioning than healthy control subjects. Most lung function parameters showed no correlation with the SIP scores. The respiratory symptoms of wheezing and dyspnea were related to patients' quality of life. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were more restricted in their daily functioning than patients with asthma. Since the relationship between patients' somatic condition and their quality of life is weak, we recommend comprehensive care that encompasses psychosocial as well as somatic interventions.\r"

In the normal subjects, there was no significant relationship between age or sex and MOP (expressed as P0.1), which is the mouth pressure developed against a complete occlusion at 0.1 s after the beginning of inspiration, and dP/dtmax, the maximal rate of rise of this pressure; mean +/- SD for P0.1 = 0.75 +/- 0.32 cmH2O, and dP/dtmax = 19.41 +/- 10.10 cmH2O/s. Similarly, there was no significant relationship between age or sex and VE/P0.1 or VE/dP/dtmax. In 99 percent of normal subjects (83 of 84), VE/P0.1 was greater than 8.0 L/min/cmH2O, whereas in only 1 of the 79 patients was the value greater than 7.9 L/min/cmH2O. While the mean values of P0.1 and dP/dtmax were significantly different between normal subjects and patients, there was considerable overlap, whereas the ratio VE/P0.1 or VE/dP/dtmax provided excellent differentiation between normal subjects and patients with lung disease. This index, which is easily measured and requires minimal patient cooperation, provides valuable information in the clinical assessment of ventilatory drive and lung mechanics.\r"

In the present study, we performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on three patients with biopsy specimen-proven DPB and eight patients with highly probable DPB (six women and five men; one smoker and ten nonsmokers), nine patients with chronic bronchitis (all men, five smokers and four nonsmokers), and nine normal control subjects (six women and three men, all nonsmokers) to clarify the cell populations in the lower respiratory tract. Neutrophils comprised 55.3 +/- 24.4 percent of recovered cells by BAL in DPB patients but only 6.6 +/- 6.4 percent in chronic bronchitis patients, and 1.8 +/- 1.5 percent in normal control subjects (p less than 0.001, all comparisons). The DPB patients also exhibited a decreased percentage of alveolar macrophages (34.9 +/- 23.5 percent) compared with chronic bronchitis patients and normal control subjects (p less than 0.001, all comparisons). The percentage of lymphocytes of the recovered lavage cells in DPB patients did not differ from that in chronic bronchitis patients and normal control subjects. These results indicate that neutrophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of DPB. They also suggest that neutrophilia of BAL-recovered fluid is a common finding in diseases associated with bronchiolar inflammation despite some clinical and pathophysiologic differences.\r"

Because theophylline is used widely in this population, we evaluated the influence of theophylline on NK cell activity in vitro and in vivo. The NK cell activity was significantly inhibited by direct addition of concentrations of aminophylline that exceeded 5 x 10(-5) M. To test whether such an effect can be observed in vivo, we administered one sustained-release tablet of theophylline (400 to 500 mg twice daily) to five normal volunteers for seven days. Significant inhibition of NK activity was noted after administration (mean percentage of inhibition, 41.3 percent), but the serum concentrations observed gave a mean value of 2 x 10(-5) M, which was lower than that yielding the same degree of inhibition by direct addition in vitro (about 20 x 10(-5) M). These results suggest that long-term theophylline therapy may inhibit NK cell activity, and thus more information would be needed to determine the position of such therapy in the management of asthmatic patients.\r"

Results of initial pulmonary function testing were normal in all three, and methacholine challenge was required for diagnosis in two out of the three. This syndrome needs to be recognized by physicians dealing with environmental or industrial medicine as a potential cause of loss of work or inability to perform on the job. Also, there is a potential for multiple individuals to develop this syndrome from a single incident.\r"

  ".W": "Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was studied in lung tissues of patients with lung cancer (LC, n = 37) or nonlung cancer (NLC, n = 13) and its relationships with the smoking habits and the degree of airway obstruction were investigated. Specimens of peripheral lung parenchyma, free of tumor tissue, were taken and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was measured in the S-12 fractions. Airway obstruction was assessed by flow-volume curves, and data were expressed as percentage of the predicted values. Cigarettes smoked were expressed as pack-years. The patients with LC and NLC did not differ by MDA content, age, and number of pack-years. On the contrary, FEF75-85 and MEF75 were significantly lower in LC than in NLC patients (p less than 0.05). The MDA content was inversely correlated to number of days patients had refrained from smoking (r = -0.66, p less than 0.001). The MDA content was higher in recent smokers (ie, people smoking during the last 30 days before surgery) than in the other patients (0.136 +/- 0.007 vs 0.116 +/- 0.007 mumol/g of tissue, p less than 0.05) and, by considering only recent smokers, MDA content was higher in LC patients (0.144 +/- 0.008 mumol/g of tissue) than in NLC patients (0.113 +/- 0.014 mmol/g tissue, p = 0.059). When patients were divided into \"high MDA\" and \"low MDA\" groups, MEF75 was much lower in the high MDA group (35.1 +/- 3.4 percent) than in the low MDA group (55.1 +/- 8.1 percent) (p less than 0.01). These results suggest the following: (1) enhanced level of prooxidant state in the lungs is associated with recent cigarette smoking; (2) LC patients may be more prone than respective NLC patients to oxidative stress; (3) MDA level and degree of small airway obstruction were associated and differed between LC and NLC patients even though these groups did not differ in the percentage of recent smokers; and (4) a common free-radical mediated pathway may be active for both LC and small airway obstruction.\r"

Mast cell-derived mediators, including histamine, have been shown to cause immediate bronchoconstriction, but until recently, no single mediator has been shown to induce prolonged changes in airway reactivity. Recent reports indicate PAF-acether (PAF) can induce increased nonspecific bronchial reactivity in normal subjects but not in asthmatics. We sought to elucidate the role of PAF in airway hyperreactivity by comparing the effect of inhaled PAF on methacholine and isoproterenol airway responsiveness in six nonasthmatic and six asthmatic subjects. Neither nonspecific airway reactivity nor isoproterenol responsiveness was changed following PAF inhalation in the nonasthmatic subjects in the six days following PAF. Asthmatics had increased airway responsiveness to methacholine at two hours post-PAF, which did not persist. Responsiveness to isoproterenol did not change in the asthmatic subjects. Additional evaluation of the role of PAF in causing changes in airway reactivity is warranted.\r"

We conclude the following: (1) complete evaluation of the pediatric airways (bronchoscopy) is recommended in every symptomatic child with diagnosis of laryngomalacia confirmed by laryngoscopy; (2) type 1 laryngomalacia was more common in early infancy while type 2 laryngomalacia was associated with older age; (3) although type 2 laryngomalacia is the most common endoscopic diagnosis in our experience, the majority of cases were associated with lower airway dysfunction.\r"

Cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance increased by 34 and 32 percent, respectively (p less than 0.05), but heart rate and pulmonary vascular resistance remained unchanged. There was a concomitant increase in oxygen delivery (p less than 0.01) and oxygen consumption (p less than 0.05), the magnitude of the latter being related to baseline lactacidemia (p less than 0.01).

  ".W": "Thirty-one critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure and circulatory shock were divided into three groups. Group 1 included 11 patients with an inserted mixed venous saturation (SvO2) catheter using three-reference wavelengths and characterized by one transmitting and one detecting fiberoptic filament (Oximetrix opticath catheter); group 2 included eight patients with an inserted SvO2 catheter using two-reference wavelengths and characterized by one transmitting and one detecting fiberoptic filament; (Edwards sat-one catheter); group 3 included 12 patients with an inserted SvO2 catheter using two-reference wavelengths and characterized by one transmitting and two detecting fiberoptic filaments. Once calibration procedures were performed, SvO2 measured by the catheter and by an hemoximeter OSM 3 (reference value) were compared following each therapeutic intervention. Over a period of 1.5 to 6 hours during which the hematocrit value remained unchanged, 119 measurements were obtained in group 1, 91 in group 2 and 181 in group 3. The dispersion of SvO2 values was much more pronounced with the two-reference wavelength systems using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments, and the correlation coefficient was significantly higher with the three-reference wavelength system (r = 0.970 for the Oximetrix catheter vs r = 0.855 for the Edwards catheter and r = 0.826 for the Spectramed catheter, p less than 0.001). After 24 hours, the spontaneous drifts in the two-reference wavelength systems, using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments (expressed as the SvO2 value measured by the catheter minus the reference SvO2 value) were significantly higher than the spontaneous drift in the three-reference wavelength system (9.3 +/- 7 percent for the Edwards catheter and +/- 6 +/- 4.1 percent for the Spectramed catheter vs 3.3 +/- 3.1 percent for the Oximetrix catheter, p less than 0.05). This study shows that a three-wavelength system is more accurate than a two-wavelength system for measuring acute changes in SvO2. The addition of a second detecting fiber optic filament does not seem to improve the accuracy of the system when SvO2 changes occur in conditions of stable hematocrit.\r"

We conclude that a biphasic pattern of oxygen utilization in patients with ARDS emerges when subsets of patients with and without lactic acidosis are compared. Lactic acidosis, a marker of anaerobic metabolism, may be a characteristic of patients with ARDS who exhibit changes in Vo2 that are dependent on changes in Do2.\r"

All men were white. Spirometry and total thoracic gas volumes (TGV) were measured and expressed as percentage of predicted of white Michigan men who have been modeled for spirometric values thereby adjusting for height, age, and in current and ex-smokers for duration of smoking. Asbestos-exposed men who never smoked had reduced FEF75-85 (p less than 0.01) and increased TGV (p less than .0001) as compared with unexposed men. The 155 men with PAS who had never smoked had reduced flows (p less than .0001), FVC (p less than 0.0056), and TGV (p less than .0001) when compared with 155 age-matched asbestos-exposed men. The 325 asbestos-exposed current smokers with normal chest roentgenograms compared with unexposed smokers had reduced expiratory airflows (p less than 0.0001), reduced FEV1 (p less than 0.004), and increased TGV (p less than 0.0001). The 325 current smokers with PAS had additional air trapping that further reduced vital capacity. Thus, PAS were associated with significant pulmonary dysfunction in men who never smoked, and current and ex-smokers had additional dysfunction even after adjustment for duration of smoking.\r"

The resulting clots were firm, 3 to 4 cm long, and 1 cm in diameter. Injection of the clots into the external jugular vein consistently produced occlusion of at least one of the lobar pulmonary arteries. In every instance in which the tip of the catheter could be positioned at the clot embolus (six dogs), the clots were readily fragmented with a number 8 French (2.67 mm OD) flexible rotating tip catheter (Kensey catheter) activated at 80,000 rpm. Overall perfusion was shown by posttreatment angiograms to be markedly improved. These studies show that catheter-tip fragmentation of pulmonary emboli with a Kensey catheter has excellent potential for therapeutic application in patients with pulmonary embolism.\r"

  ".W": "This study compares the effects of methoxamine, a pure alpha 1-agonist, and epinephrine on cerebral and myocardial blood flow, central hemodynamics, and survival in a randomized placebo-controlled fashion during prolonged ventricular fibrillation (VF) in a canine model. Twenty-four anesthetized and ventilated adult mongrel dogs were instrumented for regional blood flow determinations using radio-labeled microspheres. The dogs were randomized to receive either 20 mg of methoxamine as a single intravenous bolus or repeated boluses of 0.02 mg/kg of epinephrine, 0.2 mg/kg of epinephrine, or normal saline solution placebo beginning at three minutes following induction of VF and initiation of closed chest cardiac massage (CCCM). Organ blood flow measurements were determined during normal sinus rhythm and after five and 20 minutes of VF. All six dogs receiving methoxamine were successfully resuscitated in contrast to only one in each of the epinephrine-treated groups and none of the dogs receiving placebo (p less than .01). Although epinephrine was associated with significantly higher blood pressures than placebo during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), blood pressures achieved with methoxamine were significantly higher than those observed in the other three treatment groups (p less than .001). Cerebral blood flow was significantly higher with both methoxamine and high-dose epinephrine (p less than .05). Mean left and right ventricular myocardial flows were highest with methoxamine but this did not achieve statistical significance. In contrast, organ flows measured in the animals receiving the lowest dose of epinephrine were not significantly higher than those associated with placebo. Cardiac output after 20 minutes of CPR was significantly lower with high-dose epinephrine than with methoxamine or placebo (p less than .05). Our results suggest that methoxamine significantly improves regional cerebral blood flow and survival during CPR and although high-dose epinephrine is associated with comparable improvements in regional cerebral blood flow, this treatment is associated with deterioration in central hemodynamics during prolonged VF and does not enhance survival.\r"

In eight patients with ulcerative colitis, a manometric-catheter assembly was placed via the ileostomy into the unused portion of distal ileum two months after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and temporary diverting loop ileostomy. The distal ileum was perfused at 5 ml/min with an isosmotic solution of either sodium chloride or ileal chyme diluted with sodium chloride for three hours before and three hours after a meal on two consecutive days. Absorption was measured, single and clustered pressure waves were identified and quantitated with the aid of a computer program, and a motility index was calculated. Mean absorption +/- S.E.M. of both perfusates was poor on day 1 (-10 +/- 2 ml/25 cm x 30 min), and the meal induced no ileal motor response. By day 2, however, absorption of both perfusates was much improved (-1 +/- 2 ml/25 cm x 30 min; P less than 0.05), and the number of discrete clustered contractions and the motility index now clearly increased after the meal (2.6 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.0 clustered waves/hr; 7.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 9.7 +/- 0.2 motility units/30 min; P less than 0.05). The conclusion was that absorption and motility of the human ileum were impaired after two months of disuse, but that ileal absorption and motility improved one day after the introduction of isosmotic ileal perfusates.\r"

The overall rate of postoperative mortality was 8 percent (8 of 96) and the overall rate of postoperative morbidity was 24 percent (23 of 96). The mortality rate was 5 percent (3 of 66) after resective surgery and 17 percent (5 of 30) after nonresective surgery. Three deaths were related to the malignant disease, three were related to the intra-abdominal infection, and two were related to formation of intestinocutaneous fistulas. Of the 8 patients who died, 1 had a tumor with local visceral involvement only and 7 had a tumor with more distant spread. Median survival was 10 months for all patients, 15 months for patients treated with resective surgery, and 7 months for nonresected patients. Five patients (5 percent) have survived for longer than 5 years. The median relief of preoperative cancer symptoms was 4 months (4 months after resective surgery and 1 month after nonresective surgery). Twenty-five patients have undergone second surgery. It is concluded that palliative resective surgery for colorectal cancer can improve patient comfort with an acceptable postoperative mortality rate when cancer growth is localized and in favorable cases with more distant spread, whereas nonresective surgery fails to achieve symptom relief.\r"

Incomplete starvation of colonic epithelial cells through lack of luminal SCFAs leads, in the short term, to mucosal hypoplasia with either diminished absorption or diarrhea. A chronic lack of SCFAs or complete organ starvation in conjunction with other factors leads to nutritional colitis, either \"diversion colitis\" or \"starvation colitis.\" Whether predominantly diarrhea or colitis develops in mucosal malnutrition appears to depend upon the severity and duration of starvation. Ulcerative colitis may be classified as a nutritional colitis in that colonic epithelial cells are unable to utilize SCFAs reflecting epithelial starvation despite abundant SCFAs.\r"

With the use of 7.5 MHz and based on different echo patterns, two main groups of lymph nodes can be differentiated: hypoechoic and hyperechoic lymph nodes. Compared with pathologic findings, hypoechoic lymph nodes represent metastases, whereas hyperechoic lymph nodes are visualized due to unspecific inflammation. Lymph node metastases can be predicted with a sensitivity of 72 percent and inflammatory lymph nodes with a specificity of 83 percent. The physical basis of the differentiation of lymph nodes was assessed in vitro by the determination of ultrasound parameters (speed of sound, acoustic impedance, attenuation, and backscattered amplitude). The attenuation coefficient of benign lymph nodes [2.5 dB/(MHz x cm)] is significantly higher than the mean value of lymph node metastases [1.3 db/(MHz x cm)]. The results demonstrate that involved nodes can principally be differentiated from not involved nodes. Micrometastases, mixed lymph nodes, and changing echo patterns within inflammatory nodes explain the accuracy rate of 78 percent.\r"

Overall, 21 pregnancies (27 percent) had abnormal outcomes including spontaneous abortions (9), infants small for gestational age (6), premature infants (5), and infants who developed respiratory distress (1). Eight (50 percent) patients with active disease compared with 13 (21 percent) patients with inactive disease at conception had abnormal outcomes (P less than 0.05). During pregnancy 15 (55 percent) with active disease and 6 (12 percent) with inactive disease had an abnormal outcome (P less than 0.001). Neither medical nor surgical treatment, independent of disease activity, appeared to affect the outcome adversely. Eighteen of 73 (25 percent) patients with quiescent or mild disease relapsed, and seven of 16 patients with some disease activity improved (44 percent). Of 34 patients on medication, nine relapsed (27 percent), and of 39 patients not on medication, nine relapsed (24 percent) (P = N.S.). These results suggest that the outcome of pregnancy is not adversely affected by Crohn's disease. However, patients with active disease at conception and/or during the pregnancy have poorer outcomes independent of the use of medication or requirement of surgery.

Median age was 71 years (range, 50 to 87 years), and there was a female predominance (31 females, 18 males). The most common symptom at presentation was bleeding. The majority of tumors ranged between 2 and 5 cm in diameter and all invaded at least into the submucosa and/or the lamina propria. At diagnosis, one third of the patients had either regional or distant metastasis with a median survival of 5 months. The remaining patients were surgically treated with curative intent, either by abdominoperineal resection (APR) or local excision. Median survival was poor in both treatment groups (APR, 12 months; local excision, 13 months). Most patients died with distant metastasis. Our results confirm the opinion that APR offers no more curative potential than a more conservative surgical approach. However, tumor sizes were on average smaller in the group treated by local excision. This could indicate that, in the absence of known distant metastasis, radical surgery should be performed, particularly since local recurrences tended to be more common after a local excision.\r"

For the quantitative description of anastomotic repair, both mechanical and biochemical parameters are employed, each with their own limitations. Mechanical parameters, either bursting pressure or breaking strength, only reflect growing anastomotic strength as long as disruption occurs within the anastomotic area, which is less than one week after surgery for the bursting pressure and probably up to two weeks for the breaking strength. The biochemical description of anastomotic repair has been limited to behavior of collagen, as represented by its rather unique constituent amino acid hydroxyproline. Conclusions based on collagen concentrations--per unit weight--should be considered with caution since they may change as a consequence of changes in noncollagenous substances. In this respect, collagen content, per unit length, is probably a better parameter to describe anastomotic collagen levels. Few investigations have addressed the quality of collagen (e.g., crosslinking or type). Since, at this time, no distinct correlations have been demonstrated between development of mechanical strength or occurrence of leakage and collagen levels in the healing anastomosis, attention should not be restricted to a description of the quantity of collagen present: the quality of anastomotic collagen should be investigated, perhaps even more so.\r"

There were 1423 esophageal biopsies obtained from 1173 patients, and histological evidence of esophagitis was present in 397 cases; Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed in 10 patients (0.9% of total and 2.5% of esophagitis cases). Specialized columnar epithelium was present in seven of these 10 patients. The mean age of those with Barrett's epithelium was 19.0 +/- 7.9 years (range 3.7-27 years) compared to 8.7 +/- 6.7 years (range 4 days to 31 years) for all patients biopsied (P less than 0.0001); 80% (8/10) of the Barrett's cases were male compared to 54% of all cases. The relative importance of the possible risk factors was assessed by comparing the 10 patients with Barrett's with the 541 patients that had esophageal biopsies in calendar years 1984-1985. Mental retardation, a risk factor not previously described for young persons with Barrett's esophagitis, was present in 70% (7/10) of the Barrett's patients but in only 15% of all patients biopsied (P less than 0.0002). The frequency of mental retardation was also higher, but not significantly so (P greater than 0.07), in patients with biopsies that were positive for esophagitis (19%) than in those with normal biopsies (14%). No significant differences were found between the Barrett's group and all patients biopsied in regards to racial origin, prior stricture, or fundoplication.\r"

Data from a two-channel manometry and one-channel pH-metry recording were stored in a portable 1-MByte, solid-state data logger for subsequent computerised analysis. Comparison of predefined nighttime, mealtime and nonmeal daytime periods showed that propagated contractions predominated during mealtimes (56% of all contractions) and nonmeal daytime periods (53.5% of contractions) and that their propagation velocity (2.98 cm/sec) was at its lowest and the AUC of all contractions (134.6 hectoPascal.sec) at its greatest during mealtime periods. During the night, propagated contractions (0.136/min) and simultaneous contractions (0.025/min) were significantly less frequent than during both meal (1.31/min and 0.172/min, respectively) and nonmeal daytimes (0.665/min and 0.133/min, respectively), whereas the nocturnal segmental contraction frequency (0.181/min) was not significantly lower than the nonmeal daytime contraction frequency (0.243/min). Median reflux time was in the normal range (1.2%), although two subjects had prolonged reflux times (9.5% and 14.5%). In conclusion, all subjects showed similar patterns of diurnal esophageal contractory activity determined partly by meal intake and partly by a characteristic clustering of nocturnal contractions that could not be explained by episodes of nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux. It may, therefore, be speculated that nocturnal contraction clusters are associated with rhythmic phenomena such as MMC or specific sleep stages.\r"

Inspection of summed images permitted the selection of regions of interest (ROI) to represent the mouth, pharynx, and upper esophagus. Transit times between each ROI were calculated and compared. Significant prolongation of bolus transit time between the mouth and esophagus was present in both patients with and without dysphagia (0.59 +/- 0.38 sec and 0.33 +/- 0.7 sec; mean +/- SD, respectively) compared with controls (0.26 +/- 0.04 sec P less than 0.001, P less than 0.01, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test).

Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were utilized. Tablets or control plastic beads were secured to a silk suture thread and positioned in the rabbit esophagus through a proximal esophagostomy and a gastrostomy. Test medications were allowed to dissolve passively on the surface of the esophageal mucosa in the anesthetized rabbits. After 1 hr of drug exposure, the rabbits were killed and the esophagus removed and examined. No gross abnormalities were detected with the exception of a mild degree of erythema at some of the exposure sites. All medications and control beads produced microscopic mucosal changes when compared to suture controls. The beads and test medications caused thinning of the epithelium and increased subepithelial edema (P less than 0.05). Two changes, however, were unique to animals exposed to test medications: fraying and/or splitting of the epithelium and the presence of balloon cells (P less than 0.05). Balloon cells represent damaged squamous epithelial cells recognizable by their distended, globoid shape. The prevalence of balloon cells ranged from 22% to 89% of sites exposed to drug and was most commonly associated with potassium. Of all drugs reported to cause injury to the human esophagus, potassium chloride has been reported to produce the most severe lesions, including esophageal stricture and perforation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ulcerogenesis of the duodenal mucosa frequently involves an inflammatory reaction with infiltration of leukocytes. Measurement of neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity might thus be a sensitive indicator of damage, before visible lesions occur. To test this possibility, a rat model for duodenal injury was used where fasted animals were treated with indomethacin and histamine-diHCl. Twenty-four hours after indomethacin treatment, duodenal tissues were collected for histochemical staining and biochemical assay for myeloperoxidase activity. Indomethacin- and histamine-challenged rats had significantly elevated myeloperoxidase activity compared to unchallenged controls (P less than 0.05) for both histochemistry and biochemistry. There was also a significant correlation between these two parameters (r = 0.68, P less than 0.001). The duodenal injury model then was used to test the effectiveness of known gastric protective agents. Results indicated that milk and buttermilk did not aggravate or protect against duodenal injury, while antacid and prostaglandin did significantly protect against inflammation (P less than 0.02). We concluded that measurement of myeloperoxidase activity is a sensitive and potentially useful estimate of duodenal injury that can be valuable in assessing ulcerogenesis and healing.\r"

In this study we have examined the method used and the interaction of omeprazole and its derivatives with purified DNA. The method was shown to enrich for dividing cells (6.92 +/- 0.693%, N = 43, 2-hr labeling) in the digest from the intact tissue and was therefore unsuitable for estimating unscheduled DNA synthesis in the gastric mucosa induced by chemicals or drugs including omeprazole. It was further shown that neither omeprazole or its acid-activated product, a cationic sulfenamide, were able to react with isolated purified DNA from either a prokaryote (E. coli) or a eukaryote (salmon sperm). Hence any conclusions using this method attributing acute genotoxic effects to any chemical are based on unrecognized artifacts of the technique and are unsound. In addition, these results negate the suggestion that omeprazole or its gastric metabolites are genotoxic.\r"

We found that although a liposomal suspension of unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) administered intragastrically failed to protect rats from acid-induced gastric ulcer formation, addition of cholesterol to unsaturated PC induced a dose-dependent protective response with the maximally effective dose, reducing lesion score greater than 70%. This effect also was seen with the plant sterol, beta-sitosterol (reducing lesion score by 81.6 +/- 36%) but was blocked if cholesterol was esterified to fatty acids of varying chain length. Addition of sterols to liposomes of saturated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, in contrast, attenuated the gastric protective action of the saturated PC. It appears that the protective mechanism elicited by sterols and unsaturated PC is not mediated by alterations in gastric emptying rate or prostaglandin biosynthesis, although maintenance of surface hydrophobicity may be involved. These results suggest that the sterol may promote the packing of adjacent unsaturated phospholipid molecules of either the cell membrane or a putative extracellular hydrophobic lining of the gastric epithelium to provide the mucosa with protection against luminal acid.\r"

Mucosal biopsy specimens were taken during all endoscopies. After running, all runners had histologically pathological features in the stomach. Vascular lesions were present in the chorion in six subjects after running, with the intensity of the lesions ranging from congestion to hemorrhage. Postexercise histological examination also showed a decrease in mucosal secretion.

Under basal conditions, pHs was roughly equal in both parts of the duodenum; proximal duodenum, 7.40 +/- 0.14 (mean +/- SEM) at the villus tip and 7.54 +/- 0.16 at the depth of crypt; distal duodenum, 7.46 +/- 0.19 and 7.55 +/- 0.09, respectively. Yet, exposure of the mucosa to luminal acid (10 mM HCl) provoked a significantly lesser decrease of pHs (0.25 +/- 0.13 vs 0.42 +/- 0.12 pH units) in the proximal duodenum, suggesting that the response of epithelial HCO3 secretion to luminal acid is stronger in that part of the duodenum. Further, the initial acidification of pHs was followed in the proximal duodenum by a secondary alkalinization of pHs, leading to normalization of pHs, which may suggest activation of compensatory protective mechanisms. pHt at the villus tip was likewise roughly equal in both parts of duodenum (7.29 +/- 0.05 vs 7.17 +/- 0.04), but, again, acidification of the luminal perfusate progressively from 10 to 100 mM HCl induced a much earlier and significantly more profound acidification in the distal than in the proximal duodenum. The possible contribution of Brunner glands to the greater mucosal tolerance to acid in the proximal duodenum was assessed by investigating whether stimulation or inhibition of Brunner gland secretion modulates the response of the duodenal mucosa to acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied eight dogs with a surgically implanted thoracic spinal intrathecal injection catheter, and six gastrointestinal manometric perfusion catheters. Morphine given intrathecally or intravenously induced propagated clusters of intestinal pressure activity in the fed dogs. The minimal effective dose for morphine was 150 micrograms/kg by the intrathecal route and 450 micrograms/kg by the intravenous route. ST-91 (an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist) profoundly inhibited antral and small intestinal pressure activity with similar minimal effective dose (100 micrograms/kg) and duration of effect for both intravenous and intrathecal routes. Neither naloxone (3000 micrograms/kg) nor combined phentolamine (1500 micrograms/kg) with propranolol (300 micrograms/kg) altered postprandial antral or small intestinal motility. The capacity of pharmacologic agents to block morphine-induced activity fronts when administered in the same compartment (intravenously or intrathecally) was investigated. The minimally effective morphine-antagonist dose for naloxone was similar intrathecally and intravenously (36 micrograms/kg for both routes). ST-91 (100 micrograms/kg) when given intrathecally or intravenously blocked morphine-induced clustered phasic pressure activity while simultaneously abolishing postprandial small intestine phasic pressure activity. These data suggest the presence of opioid and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord that can modulate gastrointestinal motility in the postprandial state. Pharmacological interactions between these systems occur at spinal and target organ levels.\r"

Thus we studied 12 male volunteers with conditions of identical nutrition and patterns of physical activity over a two-week period, where one week with normal defecation and one week with voluntary prolonged suppression of defecation followed each other in randomized order. Frequencies of defecation, stool weights, total and segmental colonic transit times (using radiopaque markers) were compared. Frequency of defecations and stool weights were lower during suppressed defecation [8.9 +/- 0.66 vs 3.7 +/- 0.41 (mean +/- SE) bowel movements per week, P = 0.003, and 1.30 +/- 0.09 vs 0.98 +/- 0.13 kg/week, P = 0.01]. Total transit times were increased from 28.8 +/- 4.4 to 53.1 +/- 4.3 hr, P = 0.004. Segmental transit times were increased in the rectosigmoid (from 8.83 +/- 3.6 to 32.1 +/- 5.6 hr, P = 0.04) and right hemicolon (from 14.5 +/- 0.9 hr to 19.7 +/- 1.5 hr, P = 0.02) by suppression of defecation. We conclude that defecation habits may induce changes in colonic function such as those seen in constipation and that functional anorectal outlet obstruction may, probably by reflex mediation, affect the right colon.\r"

  ".W": "We identified irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in 47.7% of 86 women having diagnostic laparoscopy for chronic pelvic pain, 39.5% of 172 women having elective hysterectomy, and 32.0% of 172 controls age-matched for the hysterectomy group (P = NS). Constipation and pain subtype IBS were more common in hysterectomy patients than controls (P less than 0.05). In laparoscopy patients, dyspareunia was more common in those with IBS than in those without it (P less than 0.05). In the hysterectomy group, more IBS patients had chronic pelvic pain (P less than 0.005), and abnormal menses (P less than 0.01). Chronic pelvic pain was more frequently the only prehysterectomy diagnosis in IBS patients (P less than 0.05), and IBS was present more often when pain was a reason for hysterectomy (P less than 0.01). One year after laparoscopy, IBS patients gave lower overall status ratings (P less than 0.01) and lower pain improvement ratings (P less than 0.05) than non-IBS patients. In women who had a hysterectomy for pain, there was less pain improvement one year later in those with the pain subtype of IBS than in non-IBS patients (P less than 0.05). IBS is associated with gynecologic symptoms and affects the symptomatic outcome of diagnostic laparoscopy and hysterectomy.\r"

  ".W": "A study was carried out in 25 incontinent patients to evaluate some of the factors thought to be responsible for the success of retraining for fecal incontinence. Subjects were initially allocated to one of two groups; one group was trained to perceive small rectal volumes (active retraining), the other group carried out the same maneuvers but were not given any information or instruction. Active sensory retraining reduced the sensory threshold from 32 +/- 8 to 7 +/- 2 ml (P less than 0.001), corrected any sensory delay that was present (P less than 0.004), and reduced the frequency of incontinence from 5 +/- 1 to 1 +/- 1 episodes per week (P less than 0.01). Sham retraining caused a modest reduction in the sensory threshold (from 29 +/- 9 to 20 +/- 8; P less than 0.05) but did not significantly reduce the frequency of incontinence. Subsequent strength and coordination training did not significantly improve continence, although at the end of the study, 50% of patients had no incontinent episodes at all and 76% of patients had reduced the frequency of incontinence episodes by more than 75%. This improvement in continence was not associated with any change in sphincter pressures or in the continence to rectally infused saline but was associated with significant improvements in rectal sensation. The functional improvement was sustained over a period of two years in 16 of the 22 patients available for follow-up. In conclusion, the results support the use of retraining in the management of fecal incontinence and suggest that retraining may work by enhancing rectal sensitivity and instilling confidence.\r"

In contrast, in diabetic patients, cutaneous blood flow was unchanged. The corresponding changes, at the glucose nadir, with cutaneous O2 tension recordings were 286 +/- 131% (P less than 0.05) in control subjects and -22 +/- 15% (NS) in diabetic patients. An impairment of sympathetic nervous function, not detectable by simple cardiovascular tests, could be responsible for the lack of cutaneous hyperemia and sweating and could contribute to unawareness of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients.\r"

Diabetic retinopathy was present in 51 of 129 females; 7 were premenarchal, and 44 were postmenarchal. The range of severity of retinopathy was greater in the postmenarchal group. In multivariate analyses, duration of diabetes, menarchal status, and diastolic blood pressure were associated with the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy. After partitioning the duration of diabetes into years before and years after menarche, both were significant, but the number of years of diabetes after menarche was more strongly associated. At a 4-yr follow-up examination, more postmenarchal than premenarchal females had progression of their retinopathy (P = 0.06). These data suggest that stage of sexual development, as reflected by menarchal status, is associated with the presence and possibly the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.\r"

A randomized crossover design was performed on eight male type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects (mean +/- SD age 31 +/- 3.5 yr, height 176 +/- 5.6 cm, body wt 80 +/- 15 kg, duration of diabetes 12.3 +/- 9.8 yr, and insulin dose 24 U NPH/day and 21 U regular/day). The program consisted of heavy-resistance weight training 3 days/wk for 10 wk, concentrating on the strengthening of major muscle groups through progressive resistance. Blood tests included total cholesterol, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and HbA1c. These tests were repeated at three time points during the program. Field-strength testing was performed before and after training. An improvement was seen in the squat (93.6% increase, P less than 0.0001) and bench press (58% increase, P less than 0.005). HbA1c and triglyceride levels showed no change during the resting portion of the experiment but showed a significant change with the training program: HbA1c 6.9 +/- 1.4 vs 5.8 +/- 0.9% (P = 0.05) and triglyceride 5.044 +/- 1.06 vs. 4.628 +/- 0.88 mM (P = 0.01). Self-monitored glucose (taken pre- and postexercise) showed a decrease from 7.85 +/- 3.13 to 7.05 +/- 2.91 mM (P = 0.0001). Very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides did not change after training. Analysis of variance showed no significant differences over time from the three time points with regard to reductions in cardiovascular risk factors or HbA1c.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty-four patients with type II diabetes mellitus, not treated with insulin, who had inadequate glucose control on diet alone or diet and oral hypoglycemic agents were studied. Patients performed SMBG or urine glucose testing as part of a standardized treatment program that also included diet and exercise counseling. During the 6-mo study, both the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed similar improvement in glycemic control; within each group, there were significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (reduction of 1.4 +/- 3.2 mM, P less than 0.03) and glycosylated hemoglobin (reduction of 2.0 +/- 3.4%, P less than 0.01) levels. Seventeen (31%) of 54 patients actually normalized their glycosylated hemoglobin values, 9 in the urine-testing group and 8 in the SMBG group. Comparisons between the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed no significant differences in mean fasting plasma glucose (P greater than 0.86), glycosylated hemoglobin (P greater than 0.95), or weight (P greater than 0.19). In patients with type II diabetes mellitus not treated with insulin, SMBG is no more effective, but is 8-12 times more expensive, than urine testing in facilitating improved glycemic control. Our results do not support widespread use of SMBG in diabetic patients not treated with insulin.\r"

The primary data source was the list of all subjects diagnosed with IDDM who attended diabetes clinics in Turin. Other data sources were the general register of death certificates, the list of hospital discharges, and the computerized data base of insulin prescriptions. Eighty incident cases of IDDM were identified during the study in 1,130,284 person-yr for those less than 30 yr of age. Age-adjusted (world standard) incidence rates were 8.05, 8.10, and 6.96/100,000 in the age-groups 0-14, 0-19, and 0-29 yr, respectively. Estimated completeness of the primary data source compared with all other data sources was 91%, whereas the estimated completeness of ascertainment of the registry was 99%. Incidence rates of IDDM in northern Italy compare with those of European countries with low-medium incidence. A population-based register is being established for the province of Turin (951,445 inhabitants aged 0-29 yr) for the collection of incident cases since 1984.\r"

Three hundred fourteen non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients were studied, of whom 91 had either a current foot ulcer or a history of foot ulceration. Foot ulcer patients had much higher pressure perception thresholds at the hallux than those without foot ulcers (mean +/- SE 4.63 +/- 0.05 vs. 3.54 +/- 0.04 U, P less than 0.001). The magnitude of association was higher than that for vibration thresholds and markedly greater than those for cool and warm thresholds. Pressure thresholds were highly accurate for identifying foot ulcer patients. At a threshold level of 4.21 U, the sensitivity was 0.84, with a specificity of 0.96. At similar sensitivities for vibration and thermal thresholds, specificities were lower. Foot ulceration and cutaneous pressure perception threshold are strongly associated. Pressure-threshold measurements are extremely accurate and perform at least as well as other quantitative sensory tests in identifying foot ulcer patients. Assessment of the foot pressure threshold may have promise as a simple and inexpensive method for detecting diabetic patients at risk for foot ulcers.\r"

Urine samples containing between 0.75 and 1800 micrograms/ml of albumin were obtained from 31 diabetic patients and assayed by both methods. A comparison of the paired values obtained from the two methods gave a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.99. The Dialbumin assay, which used detachable eight-well strips (1 strip/sample), 10-min incubation, tap water wash, and a 2-min color development step, was read on both an ELISA reader and a hand-held analytical device (Acc-U-Dial) designed specifically for this test. The findings of this study indicate that the Dialbumin assay, used in conjunction with the Acc-U-Dial device, affords a rapid, convenient, and sensitive method for quantitative determination of a broad range (0.3-1280 micrograms/ml) of urinary albumin levels in the office setting.\r"

Within-test variation at big toes reached 8.4% in diabetic patients vs. 2.2% in control subjects. Mean contralateral variation was 7.5% in diabetic patients vs. 2.5% in control subjects. Tuning-fork sensations were inversely correlated with duration of diabetes, whereas no correlation was found with HBA1c levels or the severity of retinopathy. Ninety-nine (52%) patients had vibratory sensation at big toes of less than 99th percentile of normal values for age. In addition, 51% of the patients with clinical symptoms at extremities (n = 67), 70% of the patients without tendon reflexes (n = 50), and 75% of the patients with abnormal nerve conduction velocities (n = 60) also had low vibration sensations. All patients with lower-limb injuries (n = 7) had values at big toes of less than 2. Altogether, the graduated tuning fork represents a simple and reliable alternative to quantitate vibration sensations. Long-term follow-up of asymptomatic patients will indicate whether these abnormalities reflect underlying neuropathy. Patients with abnormal values at screening will necessitate additional investigations and special foot-care education programs.\r"

A prospective study design with three equal 8-wk periods was used. In the first period, both groups used manual methods for insulin-dosage adjustment after manual criteria. In the second period, one group of children adjusted insulin dosage by computer algorithms, whereas the other continued to use manual methods. In the third period, both groups again adjusted insulin by traditional methods. Mean premeal glycemia and glycosylated hemoglobin levels did not change in either group throughout the study. During the second period, episodes of hypoglycemia were more frequent in children without the computer than in those who used the device. In keeping with the latter outcome, the group that used the microprocessor device was given less insulin in the second period than the first (0.88 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.02 U.kg-1.day-1, P less than 0.0001) and in comparison to the control group of patients who concurrently were given an increased insulin dose in the second period compared with the first. This study showed that insulin treatment through specific computer-mediated dosage-adjusting algorithms was safe and minimized hypoglycemia by effectively accommodating seasonally changing insulin requirements. We recommend the device to help diabetic children and their families in the care of insulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

CF-V was detectable in 7 of 83 (8.4%) subjects with IDDM aged 1.5-65.5 yr (mean +/- SE 28.7 +/- 1.8 yr) and duration of diabetes 0-47 yr (11.8 +/- 1.4 yr). Seventy-six nondiabetic subjects (aged 10-65 yr) all had negative CF-V scores. CF-V scores correlated with CF-ADM (0-16 yr of IDDM, r = 0.61, P less than 0.0001) and CF-SG (r = 0.39, P less than 0.05). Seventy IDDM subjects (aged 28 +/- 5 yr, duration of diabetes 17 +/- 3 yr) without proteinuria or proliferative retinopathy were screened for CF-ADM, CF-SG, and CF-V antibodies. Five of 70 (7.1%) had CF-SG only (negative for CF-ADM and CF-V). Brake indices ranged from 14.7 to 51.3 (37.3 +/- 6.9).

Eighty NIDDM outpatients aged 55.9 yr (mean SD 11.5 yr) participated in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study of MaxEPA capsules (10 g/day) or olive oil (control) treatment over 6 wk. Patients received either MaxEPA or olive oil in addition to preexisting therapy. Metabolic and hemostatic variables were measured before treatment and after 3 and 6 wk. Platelet membrane eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content increased in the treatment group (P less than 0.001). MaxEPA supplementation was associated with a significant fall in total triglycerides (P less than 0.001) but did not affect total cholesterol (P = 0.7) compared with control treatment. Fasting plasma glucose increased after 3 wk (P = 0.01) but not after 6 wk (P = 0.17) treatment with MaxEPA. Spontaneous platelet aggregation in whole blood fell in the MaxEPA group (P less than 0.02) after 6 wk, but there were no changes in agonist-induced platelet aggregation, thromboxane generation in platelet-rich plasma, or plasma beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor IV levels. An increase in clotting factor VII (P = 0.02), without changes in fibrinogen or factor X levels, occurred in the MaxEPA group. Similar reductions in blood pressure were observed in both groups. Dietary supplementation with MaxEPA capsules (10 g/day) in NIDDM subjects is associated with improvement in hypertriglyceridemia but with deleterious effects in factor VII and blood glucose levels. Most indices of platelet function are unaffected by this therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A small rural Aboriginal community in northern Australia was surveyed for diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), hyperinsulinemia, and lipid levels. Of the 122 adults greater than 17 yr of age who participated (95% response rate), 11.5% had diabetes, 7.4% had IGT, and the remaining 81.1% had normal glucose tolerance. Both diabetes and IGT were strongly age related. This high frequency of diabetes occurred, despite the population being relatively lean. Although the body mass index (BMI) increased with age in both men and women, only 25% of the population overall had BMI greater than 25 kg/m2. There were wide ranges of insulin responses to glucose, with the upper tertile of 2-h insulin levels being more than seven times higher than the lower tertile (144 +/- 13 vs. 19 +/- 1 mU/L). Hyperinsulinemia was associated with IGT, elevated triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Lipid abnormalities were much more frequent among men than women. Cholesterol levels were an average of 0.55 mM higher and triglycerides an average of 1.05 mM higher in men than in women, and both increased with age. In conclusion, this small isolated Aboriginal population from northern Australia had an unexpectedly high frequency of diabetes (in view of their relative leanness) in association with a high frequency of metabolic abnormalities indicative of insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia, IGT, hypertriglyceridemia).\r"

Two thousand two hundred seventy-three Pima Indians (949 men, 1324 women) aged greater than or equal to 15 yr from the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona were examined between 1983 and 1989. Periodontal disease was diagnosed by tooth loss and by percentage of interproximal crestal alveolar bone loss ascertained from panoramic radiography. Subjects with little or no evidence of periodontal disease were classified as nondiseased. Thus, the incidence of advanced periodontal disease was determined. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of periodontal disease at first dental examination was 60% in subjects with NIDDM and 36% in those without. Twenty-two new cases developed in a subset of 701 subjects (272 men, 429 women) aged 15-54 yr who initially had little or no evidence of periodontal disease and had at least one additional dental examination. The incidence of periodontal disease in this group was similar in men and women (incidence-rate ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 0.5-1.9, controlled for age and diabetes). Higher age predicted a greater incidence of periodontal disease (chi 2 = 30.6, df = 3, P less than 0.001, controlled for sex and diabetes). The rate of periodontal disease in subjects with diabetes was 2.6 times (95% Cl 1.0-6.6, controlled for age and sex) that observed in those without. Although periodontal disease was common in nondiabetic Pima Indians, in whom most of the incident cases occurred, diabetes clearly conferred a substantially increased risk. Thus, periodontal disease should be considered a nonspecific complication of NIDDM.\r"

Subjects were randomly allocated to intensive or conventional education. Of 350 subjects, 70 met the study criteria, which included established NIDDM (greater than or equal to 3 mo), suboptimal recent glycemic control, dietary fat intake greater than or equal to 35% of total energy intake, and body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2. The intensive approach was associated with significantly greater improvements in dietary compliance, dietary intake (complex carbohydrate, [P = 0.013], legumes [P less than 0.0001], fiber [P less than 0.0001], total fat [P less than 0.004], saturated fat [P less than 0.004]), and total cholesterol level (P = 0.007). The transient improvement in glycemic control was similar in both groups. An intensive education program can improve dietary compliance in established NIDDM subjects more than a conventional one. These recommended dietary improvements achieve better improvement in total cholesterol but do not necessarily improve glycemic control.\r"

A sample of subjects from 64 different locations in the United States were recruited for inclusion in the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A complex survey design was used to select a probability sample of subjects from each location. A total of 4577 women were recruited, of whom 3057 underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation for the presence of diabetes mellitus. Women were classified as to their glucose tolerance based on the results of an oral glucose tolerance test or previous physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus combined with current use of hypoglycemic medication. Childbearing was defined as number of live births experienced by each woman at the time of the interview. Fasting plasma glucose increased linearly with increasing number of live births (coefficient 0.009, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.006-0.012), as did the 2-h value (coefficient 0.015, 95% CI 0.009-0.021). Adjustment for age, body mass index (BMI), education, and income substantially reduced the magnitude of the association between childbearing and either plasma glucose measurement. When the prevalence of NIDDM in relation to childbearing was examined with logistic regression analysis, a significant linear increase in diabetes prevalence was seen with increasing number of live births (relative prevalence of NIDDM, 1 birth vs. 0 = 1.73, 95% CI 1.39-2.15), but adjustment for age, BMI, education, and income greatly reduced the magnitude of this association (relative prevalence of NIDDM, 1 birth vs. 0 = 1.07, 95% CI 0.98-1.17).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study included 37 NIDDM patients with HbA1 concentrations greater than 8.5% and normal kidney and liver function who were being treated with diet alone or diet together with a sulfonylurea drug. One patient withdrew because of constipation. At randomization and after 3 mo of treatment, patients were given a standard mixed-test-meal tolerance test (MTT; 500 cal) after an overnight fast, and plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, metabolite, nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), and triglyceride concentrations were measured at 15- to 30-min intervals. Serum lipid, HbA1, and fructosamine concentrations were measured at monthly intervals. Glucose, NEFA, and triglyceride concentrations were significantly lower throughout the second MTT in bezafibrate patients (P less than 0.01-0.001) but not in the placebo group. Fasting serum insulin and C-peptide levels, but not postprandial concentrations, were reduced only in bezafibrate patients (P less than 0.05). After 3 mo, mean fasting serum triglyceride concentrations fell from 2.2 to 1.4 mM (P less than 0.001), total serum cholesterol concentrations from 6.3 to 5.5 mM (P less than 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations from 4.2 to 3.5 mM (P less than 0.001) in bezafibrate patients. There were no changes in serum lipid concentrations in the placebo group. Treatment of patients with moderately controlled NIDDM with bezafibrate improves glucose tolerance and the serum lipid profile. Bezafibrate treatment may be a useful adjunct to hypoglycemic therapy in patients with NIDDM.\r"

Ninety patients with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and 45 with type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, with AER/24 h of less than 200 micrograms/min, were included. All patients were free of major systemic complications of diabetes and overt kidney disease (mean serum creatinine 1.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, range 0.4-1.2 mg/dl). We compared timed day, night, and 24-h specimens, as well as timed spot specimens during water-induced diuresis. Most patients with type I (75 of 90) and type II (30 of 45) diabetes had AER less than 20 micrograms/min and showed significant differences in AER that were dependent on the collection time. Differences were diminished or absent with AER less than 20 micrograms/min. Sensitivity, specificity, and prediction rates of AER in different specimens were evaluated against 24-h AER. Use of albumin concentrations and albumin-creatinine ratios did not improve test performance in comparison with AER. Sampling time and the overall rate of AER influenced measurement of urinary albumin excretion. Day or 24-h AER is most useful to determine the presence of abnormal AER. AER and albumin concentration in spot samples are of limited use for initial screening and frequently require day or 24-h specimens of AER for confirmation. Day or 24-h AER should be used for long-term follow-up of the diabetic patient.\r"

Ninety-seven pregnant women at 26-28 wk gestation were evaluated over 9 mo. HbA1c and serum glycosylated protein (serum fructosamine) were determined at the baseline venipuncture of the 100-g oral glucose tolerance test performed to detect gestational diabetes. Of the 97 women studied, 13 tested positive for gestational diabetes (National Diabetes Data Group criteria). There were significant differences in the fasting and 1-, 2-, and 3-h glucose values between nondiabetic and diabetic patients (P less than 0.005 at each time point). No difference was noted in the baseline serum glycosylated protein level (2.02 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.98 +/- 0.02 mM, NS) or HbA1c level (4.42 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.3%, NS) between gestational and nondiabetic patients. Diabetic patients were followed at 2-wk intervals, with serum glycosylated protein analysis, HbA1c, fasting glucose, and mean glucose determined by outpatient monitoring. Serum glycosylated protein correlated significantly to fasting blood glucose (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) and mean outpatient glucose (r = 0.62, P less than 0.001) at the 2-wk follow-up visits. No correlation was found between HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (r = 0.11, NS) or mean outpatient glucose (r = -0.12, NS) during the follow-up period. The serum glycosylated protein level (serum fructosamine) is not a useful screening test for gestational diabetes. However, this assay shows potential as an objective marker of short-term control in evaluating the maternal glycemic state.\r"

All excess mortality studies that specify for underlying disease list diabetes as one of the major risk factors. During influenza epidemics, death rates among patients with diabetes mellitus may increase by 5-15%. Diabetes mellitus is also mentioned as a risk factor in most clinical studies, making up 3-14% of the patients studied. Even in recent studies, diabetes mellitus is only preceded as a risk factor by cardiovascular disease and chronic pulmonary disorders. To what extent cardiovascular disease and old age contribute to the increased influenza mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients remains unclear. The influence of epidemic influenza on the incidence of diabetic acidosis in combination with an impaired immune response to both Staphylococcus aureus and the influenza virus suggests that diabetes mellitus itself is the main risk factor. It is concluded that all patients with diabetes mellitus should receive annual vaccinations and that, in official recommendations, patients with diabetes mellitus should be mentioned as a separate risk group. Whole-virus vaccines are preferred over subunit vaccines.\r"

Two years previously, he had donated his kidney to his HLA-identical sibling with long-standing IDDM. Both oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests demonstrated a gradual loss of insulin secretion and increasing glucose intolerance until the patient developed IDDM 6 yr after the nephrectomy. Whether the presence of ICA is an absolute contraindication to being a kidney donor could be debated. Nonetheless, ICA should be used as a screening test to identify individuals at risk for subsequent IDDM. For those found to be positive, counseling should be provided.\r"

Each laboratory ran duplicate analyses on each sample, yielding 160 GHb values.

The between-laboratory correlations ranged from 0.69 to 0.77. When classifying patients by quartile of glycemic control, the laboratories agreed on 60% of the patients. In an effort to identify sources of between-laboratory variability, varying quantities of blood were applied to strips and reanalyzed. Five microliter drops always yielded inflated estimates of GHb. These data suggest that the estimates of GHb obtained from mail-in paper strips, although internally consistent, differ in important ways from standard laboratory values, reemphasizing the need for caution in the interpretation of interlaboratory and intermethod comparisons.\r"

In this study, we looked at the effect of the isocaloric substitution of a piece of chocolate cake for a baked potato in a mixed meal to determine whether this would increase the blood glucose in patients with type I diabetes. The glucose response to a cake-added meal was significantly greater than to a standard meal. The glucose response was no different between a cake-substitution meal and a standard meal. The reproducibility studies showed no difference between repeated standard meals. The urinary glucose excretion was significantly greater after a cake-added meal but was no different with the other pairs. There were no significant differences in the counterregulatory hormone responses at baseline between any of the paired studies. In conclusion, patients with type I diabetes may substitute a sucrose-containing dessert for another carbohydrate in their diet without compromising their postprandial glucose response. These data suggest that a dessert exchange may be helpful and not harmful in the management of diabetic patients. There is an inherent variability (at least 16%) in an insulin-requiring patient's response to a meal, making self-monitoring of blood glucose and adjustment of insulin doses necessary to achieve near euglycemia.\r"

Main-effects testing revealed that impotence was associated with both neuropathy (P less than 0.01) and psychiatric illness (P less than 0.001). Logistic regression analysis was then used to determine the independent relationships of these two variables with impotence. After controlling for the effects of neuropathy, psychiatric illness (generalized anxiety disorder and depression) remained significantly associated with sexual dysfunction (P less than 0.01). These data allow for the hypothesis that psychiatric illness may be an important contributor to impotence in diabetic men, as it is in nondiabetic men, even when neuropathic complications of the disease are present.\r"

When used properly, sulfonylureas improve insulin secretion and action, and these effects may be maintained for years. If combined with hypocaloric dietary regulation, rapid- and short-acting sulfonylureas may help patients reach and maintain euglycemia without provoking chronic hyperinsulinemia or weight increase. There is no evidence that sulfonylurea treatment causes beta-cell exhaustion; instead, the antihyperglycemic effect helps improve beta-cell function. Sulfonylurea \"failures\" are often dietary failures or may be due to late introduction of these drugs, i.e., when beta-cell function is already attenuated. Desensitization of the insulinotropic effect of sulfonylureas may occur but might be avoided by discontinuous (less than 24 h/day) sulfonylurea exposure, i.e., once-daily administration of a short-acting sulfonylurea in a moderate dose. The most important adverse effect of sulfonylureas is long-lasting hypoglycemia, which may lead to permanent neurological damage and even death. This is mainly seen in elderly subjects who are exposed to some intercurrent event, e.g., acute energy deprivation or a drug interaction, i.e., aspirin. Long-acting sulfonylureas may be more likely to promote long-lasting hypoglycemia. The dose-response relationships of sulfonylureas have been poorly investigated, and sulfonylurea therapy should always be initiated and maintained at the lowest possible dose.\r"

The beta-cell plasma membranes were derived from a transplantable rat insulinoma generated by subcutaneous injection of RINm5F cells and purified by ultracentrifugation on a 15-55% sucrose gradient. Specific binding of [3H]glipizide to purified beta-cell plasma membranes was determined to be maximal at temperatures of 4-23 degrees C, pH 7.3, and an incubation of 2 h. Scatchard analysis indicated a single binding site with Kd = 7 nM and sulfonylurea binding of 0.93 pmol/mg membrane protein. Displacement of [3H]glipizide from the purified beta-cell plasma membranes by various sulfonylureas and their analogues correlated well with their known hypoglycemic and insulin-releasing activities. Various agents, including nutrients, agents affecting Ca2+ flux, gastrointestinal hormones, and pancreatic hormones, had no effect on [3H]glipizide binding to the beta-cell plasma membranes. Putative sulfonylurea receptors on beta-cell and brain cell plasma membranes have been reported by several groups of investigators. Sulfonylurea binding to the beta-cell is hypothesized to close an ATP-sensitive K+ channel, which leads to depolarization of the membrane and activation of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel.\r"

Patients were studied before and 3 mo after the addition of acarbose to their treatment program, and a significant improvement in glycemic control was noted. Although the decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration was modest (12.0 +/- 0.8 to 10.8 +/- 0.3 mM), average postprandial plasma glucose concentration decreased by 3.4 mM. When acarbose therapy was discontinued in 5 patients, plasma glucose levels rapidly returned toward pretreatment levels. In addition to the improvement in glycemia, acarbose treatment also led to a significant reduction in HbA1c (7.4 +/- 0.2 to 6.4 +/- 0.2%, P less than 0.01) and triglyceride (2.4 +/- 0.1 to 2.1 +/- 0.1 mM, P less than 0.01) concentrations. Neither the plasma insulin response to meals nor insulin-stimulated glucose uptake improved with acarbose therapy, consistent with the view that acarbose improves glycemic control by delaying glucose absorption. Considerable individual variation was noted in the response to acarbose, and the results in 4 patients were dramatic, with striking reductions in both fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. The addition of acarbose to patients with NIDDM not well controlled by sulfonylureas appears to have significant clinical benefit.\r"

The clinical usefulness of chlorpropamide and glyburide in combination with metformin has been demonstrated in some clinical trials. The combination may provide satisfactory glycemic control for several years, and possibly insulin therapy can be postponed or even avoided. No special safety problems are encountered with the use of the combination other than those attributed to the use of metformin or sulfonylurea alone, i.e., lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia, respectively. The lethality risks of these associated conditions are comparable. It is concluded that more data are needed to evaluate the full clinical potential and the mechanism of action of oral combination therapy.\r"

This was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in which there were three treatment groups who received either 20 mg glipizide given 30 min before breakfast and dinner and human proinsulin given subcutaneously at bedtime (n = 5), glipizide and human proinsulin placebo (n = 5), or glipizide placebo and human proinsulin (n = 5). Glycemic regulation was assessed by measurements of 24-h plasma glucose profiles and glycosylated hemoglobin. Our observations demonstrate that the combination of glipizide plus human proinsulin was more effective than either agent alone in controlling overall glycemia in patients with NIDDM. The data support the concept of use of an agent during the day that has its major effects postprandially and another agent at bedtime that is relatively hepatospecific.\r"

  ".W": "For the past few years, interest has focused on the combination of insulin and sulfonylurea in the search for effective treatments for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients who fail on oral hypoglycemic agents. Although several studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of such therapy in NIDDM patients, the average effect is small and is observed in only about half of the patients. However, there are several problems with most previous studies, including small sample size, selection of patients, and simultaneous use of several end points. First, residual beta-cell function has been considered to be a prerequisite for a beneficial effect of combination therapy. Therefore, most studies have failed to demonstrate improved glycemic control after adding sulfonylurea to insulin therapy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Inclusion of patients with impaired beta-cell function will therefore attenuate the effect of combination therapy. Second, most studies have used glycemic control as an end point. Nevertheless, the insulin dose has been reduced by 20-30% to avoid hypoglycemia after adding sulfonylurea to insulin. Thus, the comparison has been made between treatments with a smaller insulin dose with sulfonylurea and a larger insulin dose without sulfonylurea. The patient most likely to benefit from combination therapy is slightly obese, has had NIDDM for a relatively short period, and has preserved beta-cell function. In such a patient, combined insulin-sulfonylurea therapy predominantly stimulates basal insulin secretion, resulting in more effective suppression of hepatic glucose production and lower fasting plasma glucose. The side effects are few, most notably more frequent but mild hypoglycemic reactions.\r"

  ".W": "The chronic hyperglycemia of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) evolves gradually and is usually preceded by more transient hyperglycemia, classified as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Already in this phase, there is an increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and many IGT subjects, like NIDDM patients, often display several of the metabolic and circulatory disturbances that are associated with hyperglycemia, e.g., insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and/or hyperproinsulinemia, delayed insulin release, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Therefore, and because untreated hyperglycemia is a self-perpetuating condition, early detection and early intervention may be necessary to prevent the progression and complications of NIDDM. This in turn would necessitate screening procedures, and the therapeutic goal should include both euglycemia and normalization of plasma insulin, plasma lipids, and blood pressure. A study in the German Democratic Republic indicated that the mortality in screening-detected NIDDM patients did not differ from that in patients detected in routine care. In a Swedish study on screening-detected NIDDM subjects, only those who had IGT rather than manifest NIDDM could maintain fasting blood glucose less than or equal to 6 mM for 5 yr by hypocaloric dietary regulation alone. In those with screening-detected NIDDM, the delayed acute insulin release and net postprandial hyperglycemia were improved by addition of glipizide, and most managed to attain and maintain fasting blood glucose less than or equal to 6 mM for approximately 2 yr after such addition. However, after 4 yr, there was an increase in blood glucose, suggesting that preventive intervention either may not be possible or may have to start in the IGT phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hypothesis postulates that these agents act, at the level of the plasma membrane, by causing the closure of a class of K+ channels characterized by their sensitivity to ATP. This may lead to depolarization of the plasma membrane, gating of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, increase in cytosolic Ca2+ activity, and activation of the effector system for insulin release. However, it is not evident that the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels accounts for effects of sulfonylureas such as inhibition of K+ inflow into the islet cells, increase in their Na+ content, or even stimulation of Ca2+ inflow and insulin release at physiological or higher concentrations of D-glucose.\r"

It should be suspected in any woman who presents with a vague or complicated history; unaccountable non-responsiveness to therapy; dramatic, seductive or demanding personality style; family history of personality disorder; sexual abuse as a child; substance abuse; or depression with atypical features. Its cause is unknown, although both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. At follow-up, patients with SD continue to have somatic symptoms, but many improve with therapy. Nearly two thirds of patients with SD attempt suicide, but few complete it; however, completions may be more common than formerly realized. There is no specific treatment for SD, but management can be organized around the following ABCs: Accommodate initially to forge rapport; Behavior modification (ignore symptoms, praise for improved behavior); Confrontation later about effects of behavior style; Decrease drugs gradually, with praise for reduction; Educate about course and meaning of illness; Family involvement to give information and help with treatment; Guilt should be assuaged in physicians, who may blame themselves when patients do not improve; Hospitalize (closed psychiatric unit) only for serious suicide risk, substance abuse, or other extreme behavior; and Intercurrent depression should be treated conservatively.\r"

Myasthenia Gravis is a complex disease and requires understanding of the many facets of its natural history and immunological basis to ensure optimal individual patient management. The long-term goal is control of the immunological imbalance; treatment regimens include thymectomy, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and plasmapheresis. The common use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provides symptomatic relief during variable daily muscular activity. Disability due to myasthenia gravis is to a large extent reversible and death is preventable. Early recognition of myasthenia gravis and appropriate treatment are often rewarded by remission that may be permanent.\r"

  ".W": "There is a very small correlation, if any, between the prior use of OCs and congenital malformations, including Down's syndrome. There are few, if any, recent reports on masculinization of a female fetus born to a mother who took an OC containing 1 mg of a progestogen during early pregnancy. However, patients suspected of being pregnant and who are desirous of continuing that pregnancy should not continue to take OCs, nor should progestogen withdrawal pregnancy tests be used. Concern still exists regarding the occurrence of congenital abnormalities in babies born to such women. The incidence of postoperative infection after first trimester therapeutic abortion in this country is low. However, increasing numbers of women are undergoing repeated pregnancy terminations, and their risk for subsequent pelvic infections may be multiplied with each succeeding abortion. The incidence of prematurity due to cervical incompetence or surgical infertility after first trimester pregnancy terminations is not increased significantly. Asherman's syndrome may occur after septic therapeutic abortion. The pregnancy rate after treatment of this syndrome is low. The return of menses and the achievement of a pregnancy may be slightly delayed after OCs are discontinued, but the fertility rate is within the normal range by 1 year. The incidence of postpill amenorrhea of greater than 6 months' duration is probably less than 1%. The occurrence of the syndrome does not seem to be related to length of use or type of pill. Patients with prior normal menses as well as those with menstrual abnormalities before use of OCs may develop this syndrome. Patients with normal estrogen and gonadotropin levels usually respond with return of menses and ovulation when treated with clomiphene. The rate for achievement of pregnancy is much lower than that for patients with spontaneous return of menses. The criteria for defining PID or for categorizing its severity are diverse. The incidence of PID is higher among IUD users than among patients taking OCs or using a barrier method. The excess risk of PID among IUD users, with the exception of the first few months after insertion, is related to sexually transmitted diseases and not the IUD. Women with no risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases have little increased risk of PID or infertility associated with IUD use. There appears to be no increased risk of congenital anomalies, altered sex ratio, or early pregnancy loss among spermicide users. All present methods of contraception entail some risk to the patient. The risk of imparied future fertility with the use of any method appears to be low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the effect of exogenous follicular phase estrogen (E) on CM. Subjects qualified for inclusion by repeated demonstration of poor CM while on CC therapy as judged by spinnbarkeit, quantity, and viscosity. Subjects were treated by a randomized, placebo-controlled format using: (1) oral micronized estradiol (E2), 2 mg; (2) conjugated Es, 5 mg, or (3) placebo administered on cycle days 9 to 14. Cervical mucus was scored blindly during therapy within 48 hours before ovulation. Twelve subjects were observed through 36 treatment cycles with mean (+/- SD) CM scores: micronized E2, 4.2 +/- 1.8; conjugated Es, 4.3 +/- 1.7; and placebo, 4.7 +/- 2.9. There was no significant difference in mean values (P = 0.96, analysis of variance) or frequency of CM score greater than 4 (P = 0.85, Fisher exact test). We conclude that therapy with the E preparations tested did not improve the quality or quantity of CM in CC-treated patients.\r"

In 17 of 24 patients, the dose of 100 mg that was locally injected was sufficient. Seven patients were given additional systemic injections. In 3 of the 4 patients with high initial serum hCG levels (greater than 10.000 mIU/mL), the clinical course was uneventful. The side effects of MTX and adrenaline were minimal. Whether this way of treatment guarantees better chances of fertility in the future is unknown. Therefore a prospective, case-controlled study comparing the fertility rates in different ways of treatment is needed.\r"

This was evidenced by a higher number of leading follicles (4.4 versus 0.6), a higher mean of maximal serum 17 beta-estradiol levels (560 versus 178 pg/mL), a shorter duration of menotropin treatment (7 versus 11 days), and fewer ampules of menotropin used (20 versus 37 ampules/cycle) in metoclopramide-treated cycles as compared with control cycles, respectively. Serum prolactin levels reached a maximum of 172 ng/mL within 1 hour after metoclopramide administration and declined to normal range within 6 hours. These results suggest that intermittent increased prolactin secretion may augment ovarian response to gonadotropins.\r"

Patients were treated with DEX 0.5 mg/d until the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration. The cells were cultured for 24 hours in the presence of androstenedione (10(-7)M). After incubating for 24 hours, the medium was replaced and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 hours. The medium was then harvested and assayed for estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P). Results were compared with those of a control group who was not treated with DEX. Estradiol production by cells was significantly lower in the study group treated with DEX. Progesterone production was not influenced by DEX. Follicular fluid levels, E2, and androgens did not vary with DEX treatment, whereas cortisol levels markedly decreased and P levels increased with the treatment. These findings suggest that glucocorticosteroids can directly influence granulosa luteinized cell function.\r"

The absorbances were not related to embryo cleavage rates. We confirmed the presence of bilirubin and beta-carotene in FF: these pigments absorb at 455 nm and are most likely serum-derived. To explain the association between delta OD455 and fertilization, we hypothesized that the FF delta OD455 is a marker of the degree of vascularization of the follicle that could be assessed by FF protein and hormone concentrations. However, no correlation was found between the delta OD455 and these FF parameters, suggesting an alternative explanation for this association.\r"

We investigated, retrospectively, whether active immunization can affect the production of immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies. In a group of untreated recurrent spontaneous abortion patients (n = 9), the range of variation of cardiolipin antibodies, during consecutive controls taken at the same time interval as after immunization, was not statistically significant. In contrast to this, significant increases of both IgG and IgM antibodies occurred after active immunization with paternal leucocytes in 10 of 15, and in 6 of 15 cases, respectively. The mean basal and posttransfusion levels were: 7.26 +/- 2.53 and 30.15 +/- 23 U/mL for IgG and 2.26 +/- 1.2 and 6.82 +/- 5.6 U/mL for IgM, respectively. We conclude that active immunization with human lymphocytes leads to the production of antibodies against cardiolipin. This effect is exerted on both IgM and IgG antibodies.\r"

Proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle was characterized by expression of Ki67 and HLA-DR and absence of very late antigen-1, B72.3, and EMA in endometrial glands. Secretory phase of the menstrual cycle was marked by the appearance and persistence of very late antigen-1, B72.3, and EMA in glandular epithelium. In addition, the solid compactum of the late secretory phase was marked by the development of very late antigen-1 in the predecidual cells.

Nutrient intake was evaluated by a validated food frequency questionnaire. Oligomenorrheic women were found to consume significantly more dietary fiber, crude fiber, and polyunsaturated fat, and significantly less saturated fat than their eumenorrheic classmates. Oligomenorrheic women had significantly lower 24-hour UCP excretion than mildly oligomenorrheic women. The groups did not differ in any aspect of body composition, body weight, age of menarche, perceived psychological stress, or urinary cortisol excretion. The data suggest that higher intake of fiber and lower intake of saturated fat may be associated with oligomenorrhea among otherwise healthy undergraduate nonathletic women.\r"

From observations of the first appearance of the dominant follicle (mean size 9.9 +/- 3.0 [SD] mm), selection was assumed to take place on cycle day 6.3 +/- 2.3. The diameter of nondominant follicles always remained less than 11 mm. Growth of small follicles was established in both dominant and nondominant ovaries up to the time of selection. The late follicular and luteal phases were characterized by a decrease in mean growth slopes of nondominant follicles in the dominant ovary only. These observations may provide in vivo evidence for the concept of intraovarian paracrine mechanisms and may have implications for the sonographic diagnosis of anovulation and monitoring of ovulation induction.\r"

Patients in group 3 had lower estradiol levels per follicle developed, lower follicular volume, higher incidence of diploid oocytes, and higher rate of oocytes with an additional set of prematurely condensed sperm chromosomes of the presynthetic gap than groups 1 and 2.

Zona drilling was performed either with acid Tyrode's solution, mechanically following zona softening with chymotrypsin, or by partial zona dissection. The fertilization rate was lowest in the zona drilling/acid Tyrode's group (7/40; 17.5%), although no differences between groups (zona drilling/chymotrypsin: 21/84, 25%; partial zona dissection: 31/143, 21.7%) were significant. The fertilization rate was significantly increased relative to untreated eggs from the same patients only in the partial zona dissection group (31/143, 21.7% versus 4/102, 3.9%). Oocyte damage occurred at a high rate as a result of zona drilling with acid Tyrode's solution (13/41, 37%). Embryonic development was compromised after zona drilling with chymotrypsin: only 7/12 (58.3%) of the fertilized oocytes cleaved, and the morphology of many of the cleaved embryos was abnormal. Although only 61% (16/26) of the diploid embryos resulting from partial zona dissection cleaved, the embryonic morphology of these embryos was comparable with controls. No pregnancies resulted from the transfer of manipulated embryos. We conclude that although zona manipulation increases the fertilization rate, losses due to oocyte trauma, low rates of diploid fertilization, low rates of cleavage, and a high frequency of abnormal cleavage reduce the number of embryos available for transfer.\r"

Dummy ET is a simple procedure that determines the most suitable ET catheter for each patient and avoids unexpected difficult and failed ET.\r"

  ".W": "Most oocyte donation programs have experienced higher pregnancy rates than usually seen in regular in vitro fertilization (IVF), suggesting that the quality of either the oocytes or the endometrium is superior. To clarify this issue we analyzed the results of transfers of 136 cryopreserved embryos originating either from donated oocytes (18 transfers) or from regular IVF (118 transfers). Transfers of embryos originating from donated oocytes took place after administrating oral estradiol (E2) valerate and vaginal micronized progesterone (P) following a regimen designed to mimic the serum levels of E2 and P observed during the menstrual cycle. Transfers of embryos originating from regular IVF took place either in the natural cycle (53 transfers) or after suppressing ovarian function with a single injection of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), Decapeptyl-Retard 3.75 mg, and administering the same hormone replacement regimen (E2/P) used in oocyte donation (65 transfers). Eighteen transfers involving 24 embryos originating from donated oocytes were affected, resulting in six pregnancies (4 ongoing). The ongoing pregnancy rate per transfer was 22%. Seventy-nine embryos originating from regular IVF were transferred (53 transfers) in the natural cycle resulting in six pregnancies (2 ongoing). One hundred three other embryos originating from regular IVF were transferred (65 transfers) after administration of GnRH-a and E2/P resulting in four pregnancies. The pregnancy rate after transfers of embryos originating from regular IVF was 9% per transfer. This was significantly less than the pregnancy rate of 33% per transfer seen after the transfers of embryos originating from donated oocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Increased sperm viability and semen content of adenosine triphosphate were either not reproducible after patients on placebo were switched over to T undecanoate or did not reach statistical significance, whereas no changes were detected in other sperm characteristics and the accessory sex glands. Intake of T undecanoate significantly increased the concentration of 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the ratio of DHT over T in peripheral blood, suppressed the luteinizing hormone concentration, and tended to decrease serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration. It is concluded that high-dose T undecanoate is not effective in the treatment of men with infertility with idiopathic testicular failure.\r"

Maximum temperatures approached body core temperatures. Mean scrotal temperatures of 10 normal men rose during sauna from 32.72 +/- 0.23 degrees C to 37.53 +/- 0.38 degrees C. During treadmill running, scrotal temperatures increased by more than 2.5 degrees C. Minimal scrotal temperatures were increased in some men with varicocele compared with normal fertile men indicating impaired cooling mechanisms. The continuous temperature measurements facilitate assessment of temperature dynamics. The miniaturized design of the Thermoport makes it suitable for routine use in outpatients of infertility clinics, in occupational medicine for evaluation of heat hazards, and for investigations of body temperatures under various experimental conditions.\r"

  ".U": "91006611\r", 
  ".W": "The globozoospermic condition has provided a unique opportunity to determine how the abnormal mitochondrial organization and acrosomal loss associated with this syndrome, influence sperm function. Despite the abnormal midpiece architecture, the movement characteristics of the spermatozoa, in terms of the curvilinear, path, and progressive velocities, amplitude of head displacement, and hyperactivation were all within the normal range. Similarly, the behavior of the spermatozoa on Percoll gradients was normal, although the capacity of the isolated fractions to generate reactive oxygen species was negligible. Of particular significance was the fact that the globozoospermic spermatozoa were incapable of sperm-oocyte fusion or binding the human zona pellucida, even after an intracellular calcium signal had been generated with the ionophore A23187. The sudden induction of sperm-zona interaction could, however, be achieved by the use of a ferrous ion promoter system to induce limited lipoperoxidation. This result demonstrates that the enhancing effect of peroxidation on sperm-zona adhesion involves a direct action on the properties of the sperm-plasma membrane, rather than an indirect consequence of acrosomal damage and acrosin leakage. Such findings emphasize the value of specific teratozoospermic conditions, such as globozoospermia, in dissecting the mechanisms that regulate human sperm function.\r"

Follicular fluid-treated sperm exhibited a threefold increase in hyperactivation compared with the controls. The use of fetal cord serum in the medium, instead of bovine serum albumin, supported the same high levels of hyperactivation, although the peak occurred at 3 hours rather than 5 hours of capacitation. When sperm were treated with a steroid-rich fraction of the FF, hyperactivation was stimulated to the same degree as with whole FF. In contrast, no stimulation occurred when sperm were treated with a FF fraction stripped of steroids. The FF enhancement of hyperactivation in vitro could augment the fertilizing capacity of subfertile sperm samples, providing also a glimpse of possible in vivo events as sperm traverse the FF-laden cumulus oophorus.\r"

In this report an in vivo model for macrophage-mediated infertility is described. Populations of macrophages were obtained from an inbred strain of mice (Balb/C) as follows: (1) in vivo hyperactivated macrophages (harvested from donor mice treated with intraperitoneal thioglycolate); (2) hyperactivated macrophages deactivated ex vivo with the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine; and (3) basal state (nonactivated) macrophages obtained from untreated mice. Recipient mice underwent ovarian hyperstimulation with pregnant mare serum gonadotropins; 2 x 10(6) macrophages were transferred on the afternoon of stimulation day 3 before injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and mating. Unfertilized oocytes and 4-cell embryos were counted on day hCG +2 as a reflection of reproductive performance. Heterologous transfer of in vivo hyperactivated macrophages, but not basal state macrophages, significantly inhibited fertilization. This effect was largely reversed by pretreatment with emetine. These experiments confirm the relevance of macrophage-mediated interference with early reproductive performance and provide a model for the development of alternative therapies (e.g., immunomodulation of the peritoneal fluid environment) for endometriosis-associated subfertility.\r"

  ".U": "91006859\r", 
  ".W": "Vanadate ions, low-molecular-weight phosphate analogues, mimic most of the rapid actions of insulin in various cell types. When administered orally to diabetic hyperglycemic rats, vanadate reaches the circulation, mimics insulin stimulation of glucose uptake and metabolism, and leads to normoglycemic and partial anabolic states. In addition, vanadate restores tissue responsiveness to insulin and hepatic glycogen levels and activates new synthesis of key enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism. This suggests that correcting hyperglycemia is sufficient to correct the typical metabolic alterations found in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. Several weeks of oral administration of vanadate to diabetic rats has not produced detectable liver or kidney toxicity. The mechanism by which vanadate mimics the actions of insulin is still obscure. Unlike insulin, vanadate does not seem to stimulate the autophosphorylation and endogenous tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin-receptor kinase or other intracellular proteins either directly or by virtue of its known inhibitory effect on protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase. Results from many studies support a model in which vanadate activates glucose metabolism by either utilizing an alternative (insulin-independent) cascade or bypassing the early events of the insulin-dependent cascade. Either of these possibilities is of clinical importance, because early insulin events may become defective, as a result of severe hyperinsulinemia, and may contribute to insulin resistance. Alternative pathways by which vanadate may stimulate glucose metabolism, e.g., by increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels and/or regulating intracellular and intravesicular pH, are discussed. From a clinical perspective, studies should be continued in evaluating the level of vanadate toxicity after prolonged treatment and searching for agents that potentiate its insulin mimetic actions in vitro and in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91006860\r", 
  ".W": "The Japanese-American population of King County, Washington, is known to have a high prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). As part of a community-based study, we reexamined 146 second-generation Japanese-American men who had been initially classified as nondiabetic. At a mean follow-up period of 30 mo, 15 men had developed NIDDM, and 131 remained nondiabetic. The variables measured at the initial visit that distinguished the 15 diabetic men from the 131 nondiabetic men were older age, higher serum glucose level at 2 h after 75 g oral glucose, higher fasting plasma C-peptide level, and increased cross-sectional intra-abdominal fat area as determined by computed tomography. Both older age and higher 2-h glucose levels are variables that have been associated with the development of NIDDM, but the association of higher fasting C-peptide level and greater intra-abdominal fat area with subsequent development of NIDDM were new observations. The elevated fasting C-peptide level persisted after adjustment for fasting serum glucose. The elevated C-peptide level represents hypersecretion of insulin and was interpreted to reflect a compensatory response to an underlying insulin-resistant state that antedates the development of NIDDM. The fasting C-peptide level was correlated with the intra-abdominal fat area, suggesting that the intra-abdominal fat area may be associated with insulin resistance. Thus, in individuals who develop NIDDM, insulin resistance, increased insulin secretion, and increased intra-abdominal fat are present before diabetic glucose tolerance can be demonstrated.\r"

These studies were designed to determine whether islets also secrete insulin in a pulsatile fashion if they are isolated from their pancreatic milieu. Isolated rat islets (80-100) were perifused 8 h in culture medium after overnight incubation, and samples were collected at 3.3-min intervals. Insulin secretion was evaluated for pulsatility with the Clifton Cycle Detection Program. Perifusion of islets was associated with a spontaneous, persistent, and regular pulsatility of insulin secretion, which was observed in all conditions tested. Perifusion with medium containing 5.5 mM glucose (n = 11) demonstrated oscillations with a mean periodicity of 17.6 +/- 1.1 min and a mean amplitude of 4.8 +/- 0.4 microU/ml when overall mean insulin concentration was 16.7 +/- 2.4 microU/ml. When the glucose concentration was 16.7 mM (n = 9), overall mean insulin concentration was 54.4 +/- 2.6 microU/ml, with increases in periodicity (22.0 +/- 1.3 min) and amplitude (10.7 +/- 0.5 microU/ml). All measurements were significantly different from those observed during perifusion with 5.5 mM glucose (P less than 0.02-0.001). Theophylline (1 mM) also enhanced the overall mean insulin concentration and amplitude (69.4 +/- 10.4 and 14.2 +/- 1.2 microU/ml, respectively) compared with control studies without theophylline (16.7 +/- 5.3 and 4.3 +/- 0.5 microU/ml) (P less than 0.01). The period of the cycle was also increased from 17.5 +/- 1.1 to 26.4 +/- 6.3 min, but this was not significantly different from the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The amyloid consists of a 37-amino acid polypeptide referred to as islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). The primary structures of IAPP from human and three rodent species have previously been determined. Sequence divergence was seen in the region corresponding to amino acid residues 20-29, which in human IAPP has been suggested to confer the amyloidogenic properties to the molecule. Using polymerase chain-reaction methodology, we determined the primary sequence of cat IAPP. Amino acid region 20-29 shows specific similarities and differences compared with human and rodent IAPP, respectively. A synthetic cat IAPP20-29 decapeptide formed amyloid fibrils spontaneously in vitro. Comparison between the structure and amyloid fibril-forming activity of various synthetic peptides suggests that the amino acid residues at positions 25-26 in mature IAPP are important for the amyloidogenic properties of the molecule.\r"

The loss of activity became evident 1 mo after the alloxan injection and lasted while the animals were hyperglycemic. In addition, diabetic aqueous humor failed to suppress retinal extract-induced angiogenesis promotion and endothelial cell growth. The absence of the inhibitory activity of angiogenesis in diabetic aqueous humor might be involved in promotion of neovascularization in diabetic ocular disease.\r"

The sequences of the gene and oligonucleotide primers will facilitate studies of genetic variation in the hINSR gene and thereby increase our understanding of the role of this gene in the development of insulin-resistant states and glucose intolerance.\r"

Labile HbA1c is formed by the binding of glucose to the NH2-terminal valine of the beta-chain of HbA. We sought a more competitive binder for the same site to dissociate labile HbA1c to glucose and HbA. Inorganic phosphates were found to have a strong allosteric effect and a great ability to eliminate labile HbA1c. We developed our method with 4 mM tetrapolyphosphate in the hemolyzing solution to eliminate labile HbA1c during the automatic processing (at pH 6 and heated for 2 min at 45 degrees C) of blood samples for HbA1c estimation. This may be useful when estimating HbA1c by the manual method.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia per se both stimulate glucose uptake and the disposal of glucose by oxidative (Gox) and nonoxidative (Nox) metabolism. However, the intracellular metabolic fate of glucose may not be the same when glucose uptake is stimulated predominantly by either of these mechanisms due to different effects on fat oxidation (Fox). To address this issue, 11 healthy subjects each had four glucose-clamp studies performed in combination with indirect calorimetry to compare Gox, Nox, and Fox at two different rates of glucose uptake (approximately 7 and 10 mg.kg-1 fat-free mass [FFM].min-1) matched at each level by either hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia. When glucose uptake was matched at the lower rate (7 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1), there was less suppression of both FFA (33 vs. 43%, P less than 0.05) and Fox (73 vs. 90%, P less than 0.05) and less stimulation of incremental (above basal) Gox (1.95 vs. 2.49 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1, P less than 0.025) at low insulin (72 pM) and hyperglycemia (21.8 mM) compared with high insulin (280 pM) and euglycemia (5.1 mM). Matching glucose uptake at the higher rates (10 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1) required greater than 300 pM of insulin (309 and 632 pM) in both studies and resulted in maximal suppression of FFA (49 vs. 46%, NS) and Fox (both greater than 90%, NS) and similar incremental Gox (2.89 vs. 2.73 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1, NS) whether at hyperglycemia (15.7 mM) or euglycemia (5.2 mM). Therefore, both hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia stimulate glucose uptake and increase intracellular glucose availability, but insulin also regulates Gox by suppression of FFA and Fox. However, when FFA and Fox are maximally suppressed, the rate of glucose uptake, rather than the prevailing insulin level, determines the distribution of intracellular glucose metabolism.\r"

In contrast to GBM, which is the product of three distinct cells, type VI collagen could not be detected in extracts from calf lens capsule, an epithelial cell-derived basement membrane. Quantitation by radioimmunoassay of the type VI collagen content of GBM from 17 diabetic and 15 nondiabetic human subjects indicated a 2.8-fold higher level (P less than 0.001) in the diabetic preparations. Because in the glomerulus type VI collagen is considered on the basis of immunohistochemistry to be localized to the mesangium, we believe that measurement of this protein in GBM preparations can provide a valuable index of mesangial expansion in diabetic and other glomerulopathies.\r"

All diabetic subjects were studied while in poor metabolic control (fasting glucose 13.3 +/- 1.1 mM; HbA1c 10.8 +/- 0.2%) and again after 2 mo of intensified insulin therapy (fasting glucose 7.2 +/- 0.5 mM; HbA1c 8.0 +/- 0.2%). Insulin-mediated total-body glucose uptake in poorly controlled diabetic subjects (3.6 +/- 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) was significantly reduced compared with control subjects (7.5 +/- 0.2 mg.kg-1.min-1; P less than .001) and improved slightly after insulin therapy (4.8 +/- 0.3 mg.kg-1.min-1; P less than .05), although it still remained significantly lower than in control subjects (P less than .01). During the insulin-clamp study performed in subjects with poorly controlled IDDM, endogenous leucine flux (ELF), leucine oxidation (LO), and nonoxidative leucine disposal (NOLD) all decreased (50.1 +/- 2.0 to 26.4 +/- 0.4; 9.2 +/- 0.4 to 6.0 +/- 0.3; 40.9 +/- 2.0 to 20.4 +/- 2.0 mumol.m-2.min-1, respectively) to the same extent as in control subjects. After 2 mo of intensified insulin therapy, the effect of acute hyperinsulinemia on ELF, LO, and NOLD was comparable to that of control subjects, whereas insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism was still impaired. To examine the effect of substrate availability on leucine turnover, well-regulated IDDM and control subjects underwent a repeat insulin-clamp study combined with a balanced amino acid infusion designed to increase circulating plasma amino acid levels approximately twofold. Under these conditions, NOLD was equally enhanced above baseline in both control and IDDM subjects (P less than .01), whereas ELF was inhibited to a greater extent (P less than .01) than during the insulin clamp performed without amino acid infusion (control vs. diabetic subjects, NS). In conclusion, insulin-mediated glucose metabolism is severely impaired in subjects with both poorly controlled and well-controlled IDDM, whereas the effect of acute insulin infusion on leucine turnover is normal, and combined hyperaminoacidemia/hyperinsulinemia stimulated NOLD to a similar extent in both IDDM and control subjects.\r"

Analysis of DNA from 16 unrelated Black American individuals with 19 enzymes and as many as six different probes, defined four polymorphisms over a 45-kilobase region. Nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.006) was low relative to that at other loci, with an average of 1 in 1700 base pairs different between two chromosomes at this locus. The observed combined heterozygosity for these four sites was 0.69, which indicates that the markers at this locus could be useful for linkage analysis in families. Linkage-disequilibrium values between the four polymorphisms were evaluated by pairwise analysis and extended haplotypes. Calculating pairwise associations by the disequilibrium statistic delta or by another measure of disequilibrium, D' (the maximum likelihood of disequilibrium, which is less dependent on frequency), significant linkage disequilibrium could not be demonstrated. However, the frequencies of the observed extended haplotypes were shown to differ (chi 2 = 9.1, df = 2, P less than 0.025) from predicted frequencies if the sites were in linkage equilibrium in Blacks. The frequencies of these four polymorphisms were determined in Black nondiabetic (n = 44) and NIDDM (n = 63) subjects. Neither the allelic nor genotypic frequencies of the polymorphisms differed between the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, an attempt was made to demonstrate by means of collision spectroscopy the presence of FFI in collagen samples taken from diabetic rats. Diabetic rat collagen samples showed mean values of absorbance per milligram of 4-hydroxy-L-proline significantly higher than those observed in nondiabetic rats, suggesting higher FFI levels. Surprisingly, all collagen samples from diabetic and nondiabetic rats gave collision spectra in which no peak diagnostic of FFI presence was observed. These data suggest that the absorbance level observed in diabetic rats is not due to the presence of FFI but to structurally related compounds, which are being investigated by means of mass spectrometry.\r"

The HepG2-type transporter is the most widely distributed of these proteins. It provides many cells with their basal glucose requirement for ATP production and the biosynthesis of sugar-containing macromolecules. The liver-type transporter is expressed in tissues from which a net release of glucose can occur and in beta-cells of pancreatic islets. A genetic defect resulting in reduced activity of this transporter could hypothetically lead to the two principal features of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance and relative hypoinsulinemia. The adipocyte/muscle transporter is expressed exclusively in tissues that are insulin sensitive with respect to glucose uptake. This protein is an excellent candidate for a highly specific genetic defect predisposing to insulin resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Modulation by adenosine of hepatic responsiveness to insulin was investigated in vivo in 10 healthy mongrel dogs of both sexes by determining net hepatic glucose output (NHGO) in response to insulin during the presence or absence of exogenous adenosine infusion. In addition, two separate series of experiments were performed to study the effect of adenosine (n = 7) or glucagon (n = 5) on NHGO. Basal NHGO, quantitated via the Fick principle, was significantly decreased by insulin infusion (4 U/min; 4.8 +/- 0.6 vs. -1.7 +/- 2.6 mg.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05). The addition of an intrahepatic arterial infusion of adenosine (10 mumol/min) during insulin infusion caused glucose output to return to basal levels (insulin, -1.7 +/- 2.6 mg.kg-1.min-1; insulin + adenosine, 3.8 +/- 1.6 mg.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05). The addition of intrahepatic arterial saline (control) during insulin infusion had no effect on insulin's action (insulin, -1.0 +/- 1.9 mg.kg-1.min-1; insulin + saline, -1.2 +/- 1.6 mg.kg-1.min-1, P greater than 0.05). Hepatic glucose, lactate, and oxygen deliveries were not affected during either insulin or insulin plus adenosine infusion. Intrahepatic arterial infusion of adenosine alone had no effect on NHGO, whereas intrahepatic arterial infusion of glucagon alone stimulated glucose output approximately fivefold (basal, 2.7 +/- 0.4 mg.kg-1.min-1; glucagon, 15.5 +/- 1.2 mg.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01). These results show that adenosine completely reversed the inhibition by insulin of NHGO. These data suggest that adenosine may act as a modulator of insulin action on the liver.\r"

Adult and fetal rat islets were cultured in medium with 2.7 or 16.7 mM glucose or 16.7 mM glucose and 1 microgram/ml human growth hormone. In both types of islets, 16.7 mM glucose doubled [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with 2.7 mM glucose, and the addition of growth hormone caused a further increase in DNA replication. TK activity in the islets showed similar changes in response to glucose and growth hormone. The correlation between [3H]thymidine incorporation and TK activity was thus highly significant. Cell-cycle analysis of cultured fetal rat islets showed that TK activity was preferentially expressed during the S phase of the cell cycle. TK activity of freshly isolated islets declined with the age of the animal. In pancreatic sections, the islet cell autoradiographic labeling index after [3H]thymidine administration in vivo likewise declined with age and was correlated with the TK activity in freshly isolated islets. It is suggested that measurements of islet TK activity can be used as index of islet cell proliferation; this method has the distinct advantage of avoiding the cumbersome procedure of preparing and scoring autoradiograms.\r"

By day 90, plasma renin and prorenin became elevated, and arterial pressure declined. Transglomerular passage of dextrans of broad size distribution (radii 28-60 A) was lowered significantly. In a subset of 8 patients, withdrawal of enalapril was followed after an additional 30 days by a return of renin levels and arterial pressure to pretreatment levels. The dextran-sieving profile also returned to baseline, becoming uniformly elevated above treated day-90 levels. A theoretical analysis of the serial dextran-sieving profiles indicated that enalapril shifted glomerular pore size distribution to smaller size. These changes in barrier size selectivity were associated with a reduction in fractional albumin and IgG clearances during enalapril therapy and a subsequent rise in these quantities after its withdrawal; urinary protein excretion rate tended to vary in parallel. We conclude that inhibition of converting enzyme in humans with established diabetic glomerulopathy diminishes glomerular permeability to proteins by enhancing barrier size selectivity. Because neither enalapril therapy nor its withdrawal influenced the glomerular filtration or renal plasma flow rates significantly, we propose that the primary action of enalapril may be to modulate the intrinsic membrane properties of the glomerular barrier.\r"

Next, diabetic rats were given either high-dose (2 mg/kg or low-dose (0.1 mg/kg) endotoxin (Escherichia coli 026:B6 lipopolysaccharide B) as a single injection. The rats were killed at intervals of 1, 4, 8, and 24 h. No significant glomerular thrombi were seen in the nondiabetic control animals, whereas the severity of glomerular thrombi in the diabetic animals was dependent on the presence or absence of CsA, endotoxin dose, and degree of glycemic control. In the diabetic rats, glomerular thrombi occurred maximally at 4 h but were no longer present at 24 h. The CsA/high-dose-endotoxin rats had fewer glomerular thrombi than rats receiving the intralipid/high-dose endotoxin, but this difference was not statistically significant. The CsA/low-dose-endotoxin rats had increased glomerular thrombi compared with the intralipid/low-dose-endotoxin rats (P less than 0.01). Insulin treatment reduced the glomerular capillary thrombi in the CsA/low-dose-endotoxin diabetic animals. Thus, CsA aggravates the GSR with low-dose endotoxin but has no significant effect when high-dose endotoxin is given. Improved glycemic control reduces the GSR in CsA-treated rats. Thus, the interrelationships of diabetes, endotoxin, and CsA on the GSR are complex, and the pathogenesis of these events is unclear.\r"

Five conscious dogs fasted 18 h were given somatostatin and replacement insulin (245 +/- 34 microU.kg-1.min-1) and glucagon (0.65 ng.kg-1.min-1) infusions intraportally. After a 40-min control period, the insulin infusion rate was increased fourfold, and glucose was infused for 3 h. Glucose was given either through a peripheral vein or the portal vein for 90 min to double the glucose load reaching the liver. The order of infusions was randomized.

  ".W": "The analysis of HLA-DQ beta nucleotide sequence polymorphism in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients and control subjects suggests a role for the DQ beta-chain in genetic susceptibility. Sequence determination and oligonucleotide hybridization was carried out on enzymatically amplified DNA from various HLA-DR-typed individuals, including the rare class of DR2+ patients. In the analysis of DQ beta variation in DR4, DRw6, and DR2 haplotypes, a correlation was observed between the presence of the negatively charged residue Asp at position 57 and low susceptibility and the presence of an Ala (DR4), Val (DRw6), or Ser (DR2) and higher susceptibility. However, important exceptions to this pattern have been identified in the analysis of heterozygous DR1/4 IDDM patients. In these individuals, susceptibility appears to correlate with specific DR beta l alleles (Dw4) on the DR4 haplotype, rather than with the DQ beta allele (DQB3.2) that contains Ala at position 57. The DQ beta alleles found in some Chinese IDDM patients also proved discordant with the position-57 correlations. Thus, although there is a general correlation between the residue at position 57 of the DQ beta-chain and IDDM susceptibility, these data do not support the notion that Asp 57 confers complete resistance or protection to IDDM. In general, these results suggest that IDDM susceptibility is conferred by specific combinations of DQ beta and DR beta sequences.\r"

  ".U": "91006878\r", 
  ".W": "Our understanding of the role of HLA genes associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is in disarray, despite recent improvements in the definition of specific alleles and haplotypes. Some genes are highly associated with IDDM, other genes are associated with resistance to IDDM, and some highly associated susceptibility genes are markedly influenced by trans-associated synergistic effects (DR3/4 heterozygotes) or protective effects (DR2/4 heterozygotes). This plethora of genetic associations has spawned the notion that there are many contributing susceptibility genes, which, in turn, has led to the search for shared structural features among different genes on IDDM-associated haplotypes. From a more mechanistic point of view, however, the wide range of variable IDDM associations, with both cis- and trans-encoded protective and/or synergistic effects, suggests a different approach. This article proposes a hypothesis in which the different HLA associations with IDDM can be simply explained by a single unifying concept: a hierarchy of affinities determines the interaction between a diabetogenic peptide and different class II molecules, and an individual is susceptible to IDDM if the class II molecule in that individual with the highest affinity for such a peptide is a DQ beta susceptibility gene. The explicit formulation of this proposal and its genetic implications provide an explanation for HLA-encoded dominant \"protection\" and for some of the more subtle genetic observations related to cis and trans influences in IDDM susceptibility.\r"

  ".W": "Subfractions of very-low-density and low-density lipoproteins were examined in 10 male normolipidemic type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients before and after improvement of metabolic control and were compared with subfractions from male control subjects matched to the diabetic patients at entry for age, body mass index, plasma cholesterol, and plasma triglycerides. Two consistent differences in subfraction composition were noted between the diabetic patients at entry and the control subjects. First, subfractions from diabetic patients tended to be cholesterol-ester poor and triglyceride rich; this was particularly marked for the low-density lipoprotein subfractions. Second, the subfractions from pretreatment diabetic patients contained higher proportions of non-apolipoprotein B apolipoproteins. This compositional anomaly, but not the lipid modifications, responded to but was not completely normalized by improved glycemic control, which was also accompanied by reductions in the plasma concentrations of all subfractions. Treatment modified subfraction distribution so that the lipoprotein profile of posttreatment diabetic patients more closely resembled the profile observed in the control subjects. These changes were achieved without significant modification of daily insulin dose. In the context of blood lipid risk factors, the results argue for the need to maintain optimal insulinization even in apparently normolipidemic diabetic patients to avoid modifications of the lipoprotein pattern toward a potentially more atherogenic profile.\r"

The aim of this study was to establish whether islet cell-stimulating antibodies (ICSTAs) also increase islet cell preproinsulin mRNA content. Wistar rat islets, isolated by collagenase digestion, were exposed to 2.7 and 11.1 mM glucose. Insulin release increased 10-fold in response to the higher glucose concentration, and dot-blot analysis of islet mRNA with a rat preproinsulin cDNA probe showed a concomitant increase in mRNA levels. The globulin fractions of four test serums, three from patients with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes and one from a patient with the insulin autoimmune syndrome, showed clear (5- to 8-fold) stimulation of insulin release. The nonglobulin fractions of these serums and both fractions of three control serums failed to stimulate secretion of insulin. The insulin mRNA content of islets incubated with the ICSTA globulin fractions was greatly increased compared with levels observed in islets treated with control serum globulin fractions. We conclude that ICSTAs not only can stimulate the release of insulin but also increase the preproinsulin mRNA content of islet cells.\r"

Treatment of pancreatic islets with CHX at concentrations (0-5 mM) that caused a dose-dependent inactivation of glucokinase activity similarly inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion. Another glucose-phosphorylating enzyme (hexokinase) in pancreatic islets was little affected by CHX. CHX-induced inactivation of glucokinase was blocked by the presence of its substrates (glucose and mannose) and an inhibitor (N-acetylglucosamine), all of which also protected against the inhibitory effect of the drug on glucose-induced insulin secretion. CHX also impaired insulin secretion induced by D-glyceraldehyde and dimethyl succinate, which are believed to stimulate the release of the hormone by being directly oxidized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, by entering the midstream of the glycolytic pathway as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, or by entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle in mitochondria after intracellular hydrolysis. The inhibitory effect of CHX on glucose-induced insulin secretion, however, was far more marked than that on insulin secretion evoked by D-glyceraldehyde and dimethyl succinate at any CHX concentrations used. Our study revealed that the inhibitory action of CHX on glucose-induced insulin secretion is exerted mainly, but not solely, through inactivation of glucokinase. This conclusion supports the view that glucokinase is a key enzyme in the recognition of glucose as an insulin secretagogue in pancreatic islets.\r"

All of the diabetic subjects were selected on the basis of peripheral or autonomic neuropathy or long-term poorly controlled diabetes. They were divided into groups according to presence or absence of vagal neuropathy based on the results of standard tests of autonomic function. Thirteen diabetic subjects had normal autonomic function tests (group 1), and vagal neuropathy was detected in 12 diabetic subjects (group 2). All subjects were monitored by ambulatory electrocardiograph, and the recordings were played back through an analyzer that identified and timed successive pulse (R-R) intervals. HRV was measured from the standard deviation of the successive differences between R-R intervals. HRV was significantly reduced in group 1 (mean +/- SE 73 +/- 9 ms) and group 2 (65 +/- 12 ms) diabetic subjects compared with the control group (138 +/- 10 ms). The standard tests of autonomic function did not distinguish the vagal dysfunction noted with HRV monitoring in group 1 diabetic subjects compared with control subjects. Measurement of 24-h HRV can detect small changes in cardiac autonomic function compared with currently available tests.\r"

Plasma and FRBC glucose concentrations increased during fetal life and were higher in erythrocytes than in plasma. Glycogen was higher in FRBCs than in adult erythrocytes and tended to decrease from day 15 to 19 of gestation and to increase again on day 21. When FRBCs were incubated in vitro in different glucose concentrations to study their capacity to compensate for changes in plasma glucose concentration, younger cells showed better glucose-buffering capacities. Glucose and glycogen levels in FRBCs increased when they were incubated in high-glucose medium, and the glycogen concentration reached was higher in the early fetal stage than by the end of gestation. Nevertheless, adult erythrocytes accumulated more glycogen in high-glucose medium than cells from any of the fetal-aged erythrocytes. When glucose was injected intraperitoneally into fetuses of different ages, there was an increase of 3.7 microM/ml in glucose concentration in blood from the umbilical artery and 2.5 microM/ml in blood from the umbilical vein. FRBCs buffered some of this change, as evident by an increase in glycogen content. Again, buffering capacity was greater for erythrocytes in younger fetuses. Epinephrine diminished glycogen concentration in venous FRBCs on days 19 and 21 of gestation even in hyperglycemia. Insulin diminished glucose concentration in arterial plasma on days 17 and 21 of gestation, but there were no changes in glucose and glycogen in FRBCs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A role for SRIF-28 in the pathophysiology of diabetes has not been previously explored, although several groups have measured circulating somatostatinlike immunoreactivity (SLI) in diabetic subjects. To investigate the possible mediation of abnormal insulin secretion in diabetes by SRIF-28, plasma levels were measured in 10 non-insulin-dependent diabetic men and 9 age- and weight-matched control subjects. Concentrations of SRIF-14 and SLI were also obtained. Subjects were admitted for study after an overnight fast, blood was collected before and at 30-min intervals for 4 h after a fat meal, and plasma samples were analyzed for SRIF-28 and SRIF-14 by specific methods. Basal glucose levels in the diabetic men were significantly higher than in control subjects (10.2 +/- 1 vs. 5.8 +/- 0.2 mM), but insulin levels were similar (79 +/- 14.2 vs. 93.3 +/- 14.2 pM). The diabetic men had significantly lower basal SRIF-28 levels than the control subjects (11.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 14.6 +/- 1.0 pM, P = 0.017). After fat intake, SRIF-28 levels throughout the 4 h of study were indistinguishable in the two groups (270 vs. 292% of basal). Basal SRIF-14 and SLI levels were not significantly different in the two groups, and SRIF-14 and SLI concentrations rose similarly after the meal. There were no correlations between basal SRIF-28 and glucose or insulin levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to identify novel pancreatic beta-cell surface antigens, mouse monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were raised against rat insulinoma (RIN5F) cells with standard techniques. Several clones were identified whose antibodies bound specifically to RIN5F cells but not to other rat, mouse, and human target cells. Each of these MoAbs was radiolabeled, and the specificity of binding of each MoAb was determined by the ability of excess cold homologous MoAb to displace the labeled MoAb. Six RIN5F cell-specific MoAbs of different epitopic specificities were identified. The relevance of these beta-cell epitopes to human insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) was demonstrated by the differential ability of human serums from control and diabetic children to displace the radiolabeled MoAbs from the RIN5F cells. Serums from 333 children without diabetes or a family history of diabetes and from 156 newly diagnosed IDDM patients were tested. Only one IgM MoAb was specifically displaced by the IDDM serums, i.e., 146 of 156, compared to serums from control children, i.e., 10 of 333. With immunofluorescence, the serum component responsible for the displacement of the mouse MoAb was identified as IgG. Most of the positive control serums were from children with active autoimmune thyroiditis. Serums from children with other forms of glucose intolerance did not displace MoAb 1A2. There was no correlation between age and the degree of displacement of 1A2. Thus, the displacement of 1A2 is a specific and sensitive marker of diabetes susceptibility easily applicable to mass screening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Administration of englitazone at 5-50 mg.kg-1.day-1 lowered plasma glucose and insulin dose dependently without producing frank hypoglycemia in either the diabetic or nondiabetic lean animals. The glucose-lowering effect in ob/ob mice preceded the reduction in hyperinsulinemia. On cessation of drug, plasma insulin returned to untreated levels within 48 h, whereas plasma glucose rose slowly over 5 days. Englitazone (50 mg/kg) for 11 days lowered plasma glucose (22.2 +/- 1.4 to 14.0 +/- 1.9 mM), insulin (7.57 +/- 0.67 to 1.64 +/- 0.60 nM), nonesterified fatty acids (1813 +/- 86 to 914 +/- 88 microM), glycerol (9.20 +/- 0.98 to 4.94 +/- 0.03 mM), triglycerides (1.99 +/- 0.25 to 1.03 +/- 0.11 g/L), and cholesterol (6.27 +/- 0.96 to 3.87 +/- 0.57 mM), but no effects were observed 3 h after a single dose. Basal and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis were enhanced in adipocytes from ob/ob mice treated with 50 mg/kg englitazone for 11 days compared with lipogenesis in cells from vehicle-treated controls. Treatment of ob/ob mice with 50 mg/kg englitazone reversed the defects in insulin-stimulated glycolysis (from [3-3H]glucose) and glycogenesis and basal glucose oxidation (from [1-14C]glucose) in isolated soleus muscles. Englitazone (30 microM) stimulated 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes from 0.37 +/- 0.03 to 0.65 +/- 0.06 and 1.53 nmol.min-1.mg-1 protein at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Thus, englitazone has 1) insulinomimetic and insulin-enhancing actions in vitro and 2) glucose-, insulin-, triglyceride-, and cholesterol-lowering properties in an animal model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in which sulfonylureas have little or no effect. Thus, this new agent may have beneficial effects including a reduced risk of hypoglycemia in patients with NIDDM.\r"

Methylglucose equilibrated in two phases--the first with a half-time of 1.7 s and the second with a half-time of 23 s; it eventually equilibrated in an intracellular space of 8 microliters/mg protein. Entry of glucose remained almost linear for 10 s, making its transport kinetics easier to study (Km = 5.7 mM, Vmax = 590 nmol.s-1.ml-1 cell water).

Furthermore, whether the denervated pancreas allografts exhibit beta-cell hyperresponsiveness to physiological and pharmacological stimulation is controversial. We evaluated beta-cell function and HIE after successful whole cadaveric PAT with systemic venous drainage in 13 type I diabetic patients before and after mixed-meal and intravenous glucose and glucagon administration. The results were compared with those of 5 nondiabetic patients with kidney transplantation only, who had native innervated pancreases with portal insulin delivery and were receiving an equivalent triple immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporin, azathioprine, and prednisone), and 7 healthy control subjects with no family history of diabetes. After PAT, fasting and poststimulation serum glucose concentrations were normalized. PAT was associated with marked basal hyperinsulinemia (3- to 8-fold) as assessed by immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels in type I diabetic patients (mean +/- SE 345 +/- 43 pM) compared with control subjects (43 +/- 14 pM) and nondiabetic kidney-transplantation patients (129 +/- 38 pM).

Postmeal plasma glucose was increased in diabetic versus control rats (18.7 vs. 7.7 mM, P less than 0.01) and was normalized by addition of lithium and vanadate (8 mM) or lithium, vanadate, zinc, and magnesium (7.4 mM). Euglycemic insulin-clamp studies were performed 2 wk posttreatment; insulin-mediated glucose uptake was reduced in diabetic compared with control rats (142 +/- 4 vs. 200 +/- 5 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01), returned to normal with lithium and vanadate (206 +/- 6 mumol.kg-1.min-1), or increased to supranormal levels with lithium, vanadate, zinc, and magnesium (238 +/- 6 mumol.kg-1.min-1). During the insulin clamp, muscle glycogenic rate was severely impaired in diabetic versus control rats (18 vs. 70 mumol.kg-1.min-1) and was normalized by lithium and vanadate (91 mumol.kg-1.min-1) or lithium, vanadate, zinc, and magnesium (93 mumol.kg-1.min-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Previous studies showed that levels of IGFBP-1 are regulated by insulin. The relative role of GH in the regulation of IGFBP-1 levels is less well defined and was examined in our study with a contiguous two-part protocol. Overnight (part A) and pre- and post-morning meal (part B) blood samples were obtained from eight healthy adults during a constant infusion of saline (SAL) or 4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 GH. Five of eight subjects were restudied with glucose (GLUC) infused during part B (SAL + GLUC) to match glucose and insulin to levels observed during GH infusion. During SAL infusion, IGFBP-1 levels measured by specific radioimmunoassay showed a marked immediate decline after the evening meal in part A, with a subsequent nocturnal rise of 2.4- to 17.3-fold. GH infusion resulted in a similar meal-induced fall in IGFBP-1 levels but led to a delayed nocturnal rise in IGFBP-1, which was associated with elevated postprandial insulin concentrations. During part B, changes in plasma IGFBP-1 levels showed a similar pattern, with a delayed postprandial increase observed during both GH and SAL + GLUC infusions. The half-life of IGFBP-1 disappearance was calculated at approximately 2 h for all three infusion groups. Comparison of venous and arterialized blood samples showed no consistent pattern of difference, arguing against peripheral tissue clearance or compartmentalization as the mechanism for the rapid rise and fall in IGFBP-1 levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is believed to protect against atherosclerosis and is glycosylated at increased levels in diabetic individuals, the effects of nonenzymatic glycosylation of HDL3 on binding of HDL3 to cultured fibroblasts and to the candidate HDL-receptor protein were examined. HDL3 was glycosylated in vitro with glucose alone or in combination with sodium cyanoborohydride. With this catalyst, up to 40-50% of the lysine residues could be glycosylated, resulting in a progressive drop to nearly 60% in high-affinity binding to cultured fibroblasts at 4 degrees C. Binding to the 110,000-Mr candidate HDL-receptor protein was reduced by almost 75%. At levels of HDL glycosylation equivalent to the 3-5% observed in diabetes, high-affinity binding to fibroblasts at 4 degrees C was diminished by up to 15-20%. Binding kinetic studies paradoxically suggested that glycosylated HDL3 binds with higher affinity to a reduced number of binding sites. The findings in this study suggest that nonenzymatically glycosylated HDL may be functionally abnormal and might contribute to the development of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "Preliminary data from our group indicated that cyclosporin A induced frequent remissions of insulin dependency in a group of 40 insulin-dependent (type I) diabetic children if given at the onset of clinical manifestations of diabetes. We report a 2-yr analysis of the response to cyclosporin A in the group of 81 patients included in the initial study. As observed before, a remission could be obtained in most of the patients (65%) in association with a shorter duration of symptoms, less severe hyperglycemia, lower incidence of ketoacidosis, and higher plasma C-peptide concentrations. All remissions ended during the follow-up period after a mean +/- SE duration of 316 +/- 21 days (range 31-850 days). Two parameters were linked to the duration of remissions: the mean circulating level of cyclosporin during the first 3 mo and the duration of prediagnostic polyuria. We were unable to relate the end of a remission to variations in the cyclosporin regimen, titer of autoantibodies, or progression of beta-cell failure. The euglycemic clamp technique revealed that insulin sensitivity decreases with time in patients not taking insulin. At 24 mo, the patients who had a remission of insulin dependency had better glycemic control, lower insulin dosages, and C-peptide levels two- to threefold higher than the nonremission patients and four- to sixfold higher than the historical control subjects. The cyclosporin regimen was well tolerated over the observed period: more specifically, serum creatinine remained unchanged, and kidney biopsies performed at 18-24 mo of treatment were within normal limits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "NOD mice were treated with silica (which is selectively toxic to macrophages) from 4 or 20.5 wk of age. Syngeneic neonatal pancreases were transplanted into the renal subcapsular space of the NOD mice at 21 wk of age. Silica treatment was continued until 24 wk of age, and then the mice were killed for examination of islet morphology. Neither the islets in transplanted pancreases nor the host pancreatic islets from the early long-term silica-treated animals revealed insulitis. In contrast, most of the islets in transplanted pancreases from the late short-term silica-treated animals showed severe insulitis and beta-cell necrosis, as did the host islets. A further experiment was performed to compare the effect of late short-term silica treatment with that of anti-L3T4-antibody treatment of the same time and duration. In contrast to the late short-term silica-treated animals, the transplanted pancreases in the anti-L3T4-antibody-treated animals revealed intact islets, although most of the host islets showed insulitis. The control group, which received no treatment but did receive neonatal pancreases, revealed severe insulitis and beta-cell necrosis of both transplanted and host islets. These results suggest that early macrophage depletion can abolish the development of beta-cell-specific immunologic effectors but that late macrophage depletion, after the development of insulitis, does not affect the destruction of beta-cells by preexisting effectors other than macrophages. We conclude that macrophages are essential for the development of beta-cell-specific cytotoxic effectors in the initial phase of insulitis in NOD mice.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphocytes bearing the T-lymphocyte differentiation antigen RT6 play an important immunoregulatory role in the development of autoimmune diabetes in BB rats. Immunofluorescence studies suggest that diabetes-prone (DP)- but not diabetes-resistant (DR)-BB rat lymphocytes fail to express RT6 antigen during ontogeny. Two alloantigenic forms of the molecule exist, i.e., RT6.1 and RT6.2; both are linked to cell membranes by a phosphatidylinositol (PI) linkage. In these studies, PI-phospholipase C (PLC) treatment of lymphocytes from BB and normal rats followed by immunoabsorption and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of released proteins with anti-RT6 allotype-specific monoclonal antibodies was performed. RT6.1 in several nondiabetic rat strains was found to consist of a family of nonglycosylated and variably glycosylated molecules: an N-Glycanase-resistant 24,000- to 26,000-Mr peptide and four N-Glycanase-sensitive peptides of 29,000, 31,000, 33,000, and 34,000 Mr. In contrast, RT6.2 was found to be a 24,000- to 26,000-Mr nonglycosylated polypeptide. The electrophoretic pattern of RT6.1 was observed to be the same when the antigen was extracted from W3/25+ (CD4+) versus W3/25- T lymphocytes or from resting versus mitogen-activated cells. A pattern of bands characteristic of the RT6.1 antigen found in normal rat strains was detected after PLC treatment or detergent solubilization of lymphocytes obtained from DR rats. In contrast, no evidence of either RT6 species was found after PLC or detergent treatment of comparable numbers of T lymphocytes from DP-BB rats. Interestingly, T lymphocytes from Wistar-Furth (RT6.2+) x DP (RT6-) F1 crosses were observed to coexpress both RT6.2 and RT6.1 molecules, with the electrophoretic pattern of RT6.1 being similar to that obtained in DR and other rat strains. This study provides biochemical evidence that DP rats may have an intact RT6a structural gene.\r"

Fasting plasma insulin concentrations in ob/ob and lean mice were 1.22 +/- 0.10 and 0.23 +/- 0.05 nM, and plasma glucose levels were 6.90 +/- 0.84 and 4.70 +/- 0.29 mM, respectively. Administration of U 50488h (1 mg/kg body wt i.p.) to ob/ob mice dramatically raised plasma insulin by 670 and 790 pM at 15 and 30 min. Plasma glucose was raised from 5 min onward to a maximum increment of 4.2 mM above baseline. These effects were blocked by simultaneous administration of naloxone (10 mg/kg). A higher dose of U 50488h (10 mg/kg body wt i.p.) was required to produce significant increases in lean mouse plasma insulin (81 pM at 15 min) and glucose (0.7, 1.1, and 1.7 mM at 5, 15, and 30 min, respectively). Dynorphin (1 mg/kg body wt i.p.) raised plasma insulin in ob/ob mice by 380 and 410 pM at 15 and 30 min and raised plasma glucose by 1.6 mM at 15 min. In lean mice, the same dose of dynorphin had no effect on plasma insulin concentrations but induced a small rise in glucose. In ob/ob mice, the agonist-induced rise in glucose did not cause the insulin response, because insulin levels were not elevated by a glucose challenge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An experimental autoimmune diabetes in mice characterized by delayed-onset hyperglycemia with lymphocytic infiltrations of the pancreatic islets can be induced by multiple administrations of low doses of streptozocin (STZ). We report on the influence of the MHC (H-2 complex) on this autoimmune diabetes by comparing the susceptibilities of various congenic and recombinant strains with a B10 background. In congenic strains, C57BL/10 (H-2b) and B10.BR (H-2k) mice showed a high incidence of diabetes, whereas B10.D2 (H-2d) and B10.S (H-2s) mice showed a low incidence. Therefore, we suggest that the H-2 complex influences diabetes susceptibility and that both b and k are high-susceptibility alleles, whereas d and s are low-susceptibility alleles. In recombinant strains, those with the same haplotypes on the K, E, S, and D subregions of the H-2 complex showed undefined (high and low) susceptibilities, indicating that the diabetes-susceptibility genes are located outside these loci. Strains possessing I-Ab or I-Ak gene products (C57BL/10, B10.BR, B10.TL, B10.A, and B10.A(2R] showed high incidences, whereas strains possessing I-Ad or I-As (B10.D2, B10.S, B10.S(7R), B10.S(9R), and B10.GD) showed low incidences. In addition, administration of anti-I-A monoclonal antibody prevented the manifestation of diabetes in STZ-administered mice. Passive transfer of STZ-administered T lymphocytes to mice given minute doses of STZ induced significant hyperglycemia. This successful transfer was only observed in H-2-compatible mice. Thus, we conclude that one gene coding for susceptibility to this experimental diabetes was located in the I-A subregion within the H-2 complex.\r"

In the aqueous humor, glucose rose linearly with increased serum glucose, sorbitol was markedly increased in the MD and SD groups, and myo-inositol did not change in any diabetic group. There was no change in glucose or sorbitol in aortic myointima in any group, but myoinositol was decreased in 19-day diabetic rabbits by 26%, unchanged in MD rabbits but paradoxically increased by 60% in SD rabbits. Glucose, sorbitol, and myo-inositol increased in all three corneal layers in SD rabbits but only in epithelium and stroma in 19-day and MD rabbits. AVN glucose and sorbitol did not change in 19-day diabetic, MD, or SD diabetic rabbits. AVN myo-inositol was three times higher than ventricular myo-inositol and did not appear to change in SD rabbits. Retinal pigmented epithelium myo-inositol was decreased 30% in SD rabbits. Glomerular myo-inositol was also decreased, but not significantly, in SD rabbits. We conclude that the paradoxical increase in corneal and aortal myo-inositol raises fundamental questions about the general applicability of the myo-inositol-depletion hypothesis.\r"

New, fully automated techniques of statistical analysis of the complete set of esophageal pressure and pH signals were used to examine the temporal relation between pain, esophageal motility disturbances, and gastroesophageal reflux. The analysis used the 97.5th percentile of amplitude and duration of all esophageal contractions in each patient as well as a chi 2 test of the distribution of contraction types to determine whether a pain episode was related to abnormal motility or not. The edrophonium test results were positive in 2 patients. Only 25 patients (56.8%) had at least one pain episode (total, 111 episodes) during 24-hour recording. Thirty-three percent of the pain episodes were related to reflux and 23.4% to abnormal motility, and 43.2% were not related to an esophageal function disturbance. In the patient-oriented analysis in this study, it was required for a positive correlation that the symptom index (percentage of related pain episodes) was higher than 75%. It was found that the pain was related to reflux in 2 patients (4.6%), to reflux and motor abnormalities in 4 (9.2%), and to motor abnormalities in 2 patients (4.6%). In 36 patients (81.8%), no relation with an esophageal abnormality could be established, either because the patients had no pain during the 24-hour study, or because the pain seemed unrelated to reflux or abnormal motility.\r"

The degree of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation appeared to correlate with the degree of crural diaphragm inhibition during transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation.

This condition has been termed \"cricopharyngeal achalasia.\" The aim of this study was to determine the pathogenesis of cricopharyngeal bars. Concurrent videofluoroscopic and manometric examinations of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter were performed in a cohort of six patients with prominent cricopharyngeal bars and in eight control volunteers. In each subject, swallows of 2-30-mL barium boluses were recorded. The patients with cricopharyngeal bars showed (a) normal peristaltic contraction in the pharynx, (b) normal axial upper esophageal sphincter pressure and relaxation, (c) normal flow rate across the upper esophageal sphincter, and (d) normal duration of upper esophageal sphincter opening for different bolus volumes. The major abnormalities in the patients with cricopharyngeal bars were (a) reduced maximal dimensions of the upper esophageal sphincter during the transsphincteric flow of barium and (b) increased intrabolus pressure upstream to the upper esophageal sphincter. Thus, the increase in intrabolus pressure preserved normal transsphincteric flow rates even though the upper esophageal sphincter did not open normally. Overall, the constellation of findings in the patients studied suggests that the underlying pathogenesis of their cricopharyngeal bar was reduced muscle compliance wherein the relaxed cricopharyngeus did not distend normally during swallowing.\r"

With a 50-mL oral dose, the mean gastric emptying rate of the log-linear phase was successively faster during phase I (0.018 +/- 0.003 min-1), phase II (0.083 +/- 0.031 min-1), and late phase II/III (0.171 +/- 0.066 min-1) (P less than 0.05). Similarly, the mean lag time decreased successively with phases I, II, and late II/III (19.1 +/- 12.4, 7.6 +/- 5.6, and 3.8 +/- 2.8 minutes, respectively). At a 200-mL oral dose, there was no difference in the emptying rate between phase I and phase II (0.104 +/- 0.0014 vs. 0.110 +/- 0.041 min-1), but the emptying rate during late phase II/III was significantly greater (0.236 +/- 0.069 min-1); lag time was not dependent on phase. There was a statistical difference in the overall mean emptying rate between the 50- and 200-mL volumes. Also, during phase I, the emptying rate was faster for the 200-mL volume. This study shows a strong dependence of liquid gastric emptying rate and lag time on interdigestive antral motility, the emptying of small volumes being more dependent on motility phase than that of large volumes. Phase-related fluctuations in contractile activity can account for much of the reported variability in gastric emptying data. Furthermore, this study suggests that dose volume and interdigestive motor activity at the time of drug administration can affect absorption and onset of therapeutic response for some drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 are biologically active peptides derived from the posttranslational cleavage of prosomatostatin. Because both peptides are found in variable concentrations in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and pancreas, it has been contended that somatostatin-28 is either an intermediate in the processing to somatostatin-14 or a terminal product derived from prosomatostatin. To address this question, two antisera were used to recognize epitopes in two regions of somatostatin-14; one with high specificity for somatostatin-14 and the other interacting with prosomatostatin, somatostatin-28, and somatostatin-14. Distribution of these peptides was measured in extracts of pancreas and mucosa and submucosa/muscularis from the rat and human GI mucosal biopsies; the antisera were used to immunostain cells in these tissues. Extracts of human and rat intestinal mucosa contained both somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14. By immunocytochemistry, D cells in stomach and pancreas and neural processes in the intestine, extending into the mucosal villi adjacent to endocrine cells, stained with both antisera indicating the presence of somatostatin-14, prosomatostatin, and possibly somatostatin-28. In contrast, endocrine cells in the gut reacting with antisera against somatostatin-28 did not immunostain with somatostatin-14-specific antisera. Thus, these data suggest that somatostatin-28 is the terminal peptide processed from prosomatostatin in intestinal mucosal cells, whereas somatostatin-14 is the major final product in gastric and pancreatic D cells and neurons. The localization of somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14 in different cells in the pancreas and GI tract implies that they serve different functions.\r"

  ".W": "To validate a recent proposal that a phospholipid lining with a high content of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine may protect gastric mucosa against luminal acid, it was decided to study composition and metabolism of phospholipids in the gastric mucosa. Phospholipids were analyzed in rat, human, and dog gastric mucosal surface tissue and in a chloroform/methanol-lavage of rat and canine stomach. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were the main components. Saturated fatty acids were almost exclusively esterified at the sn-1 position of the glycerol moiety of phosphatidylcholine, and unsaturated fatty acids mainly at the sn-2 position. The disaturated class of phosphatidylcholine comprised 2%-6% of total phosphatidylcholine. Precursors of phosphatidylcholine, i.e., [32P]orthophosphate and [methyl-14C]choline, were preferentially incorporated into the disaturated molecular class 0.5-6 hours after IV administration. It can be speculated that disaturated phosphatidylcholine, although quantitatively a minor component, is specifically triggered in mucosal renewal processes.\r"

  ".W": "The intermediary pathways in the bombesin-induced somatostatin release were examined in isolated perfused rat stomach obtained from male rats that were fasted overnight. The stomachs were perfused by way of the celiac artery. On coinfusion of 1.0 mumol/L tetrodotoxin and 1 nmol/L bombesin, a significant depression in release of somatostatin was observed compared with that observed with bombesin alone. The 5-minute integrated somatostatin response after treatment with tetrodotoxin and bombesin was 173% +/- 14% of basal, which was significantly lower than that observed with bombesin alone (394% +/- 59% of basal, P less than 0.05) but significantly higher than that observed with medium-199 alone (95% +/- 7% of basal, P less than 0.05); this indicated that approximately 70% of the bombesin-stimulated somatostatin release was indirectly mediated through neural pathways, while a significant (approximately 30%) segment of it was mediated by nonneural mechanisms. To test if the 30% somatostatin release was secondary to gastrin release in response to bombesin, gastrin antiserum and bombesin (1 nmol/L) were coadministrated in the presence or absence of tetrodotoxin (1 mumol/L). Gastrin antiserum alone did not significantly affect basal release of somatostatin but caused a significant inhibition (approximately 23%) of bombesin-provoked somatostatin release. Coadministration of gastrin antiserum and tetrodotoxin attenuated bombesin-stimulated somatostatin release. Gastrin (1 mumol/L) alone significantly stimulated somatostatin release (150% +/- 10% of basal), which was completely attenuated in the presence of gastrin antiserum. Tetrodotoxin did not affect bombesin-elicited gastrin release, confirming that bombesin-stimulated gastrin release was directly mediated. To determine the nature of the neural pathways mediating the bombesin-induced somatostatin release, atropine (100 nmol/L) was used. Atropine inhibited bombesin-induced somatostatin release to the same extent as tetrodotoxin, indicating that cholinergic pathways mediated bombesin-induced somatostatin release. These results show that almost all the somatostatin response to bombesin is indirectly mediated, and is composed of a major neural (cholinergic) and a minor nonneural pathway. The nonneural mechanism appears to be contributed primarily by gastrin released in response to bombesin, which apparently has a short paracrine positive feedback effect on somatostatin release.\r"

Sixty patients with endoscopic evidence of an ulcer with active bleeding (n = 26) or a nonbleeding visible vessel (n = 34) were randomly assigned to receive multipolar electrocoagulation or injection with absolute ethanol. Hemostasis was achieved in 14 of 14 actively bleeding patients with multipolar electrocoagulation vs. 10 of 12 (83%) treated with injection. No significant differences were observed between electrocoagulation and injection therapy in any parameter assessed during the hospitalization: incidence of further bleeding (6% vs. 10%), units of blood transfused after treatment (1.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.4), incidence of surgery for bleeding (6% vs. 7%), length of hospital stay in days (5.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.2 +/- 2.5), cost of hospitalization (+7160 +/- +1630 vs. +8520 +/- +2960), or mortality rate (3% vs. 3%). Treatment induced bleeding in nonbleeding visible vessels in 35% of subjects in each group, but this was controlled with continued treatment in all patients. One delayed perforation occurred 9 days after multipolar electrocoagulation. Multipolar electrocoagulation and injection therapy are of comparable efficacy in the treatment of patients with clinical evidence of a major upper gastrointestinal bleed and endoscopic evidence of an ulcer with active bleeding or a nonbleeding visible vessel.\r"

At the end of the study, the degree of hyperplasia was unchanged in 9 patients, had decreased in 2, and had increased in 1; no significant increase in the number of argyrophil clusters, precarcinoid changes, or carcinoid tumors were observed and the high level of gastrinemia [mean, 4.8 (range, 1.9-8.1) times the upper limit for normal) did not change significantly. Of the 6 patients with no hyperplasia at the outset of the study, 4 continued without hyperplasia and 2 presented a low-grade hyperplasia at the 20th and 130th month. Gastrinemia increased significantly in the last patient and stayed normal in the other 5.

The organism colonized the stomach in large numbers in mucus and deep in the gastric pits and showed the same gastric trophism found with H. pylori. Significant histopathology was seen in all H. felis-infected mice. At 2 weeks postinfection, an acute inflammatory response was seen composed primarily of eosinophils and neutrophils. At 3 weeks, the polymorphonuclear response was more pronounced with large numbers of neutrophils in some areas forming small microabscesses. Lymphocytes also increased in number. By 8 weeks, several relatively large lymphoid nodules were present in the submucosa. Multiple small microabscesses were still present in the pyloric mucosa. This is the first animal model of bacterial gastritis to be described that shows progression from acute inflammation to persistent acute on chronic inflammation (active chronic) as is seen in human infection with H. pylori.\r"

The active and passive mechanical properties of these muscles were also evaluated. All muscle types were contracted by acetylcholine and histamine. Longitudinal muscle from both species was contracted by prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha, although rabbit muscle was more sensitive. Prostaglandin E2 relaxed the majority of both human and rabbit circular muscle preparations that were studied. Prostaglandin F2 alpha first relaxed and then contracted circular muscle from both species. Leukotriene B4 had no effect on any tissue studied. Leukotriene D4 caused transient relaxations in a proportion of all muscle types, but the relaxations were not concentration-related. Contractile responses did not differ under isotonic recording conditions, but relaxations were much more clearly defined. Based on experiments using atropine, phentolamine and propranolol, and pyrilamine or tetrodotoxin, it was concluded that the responses of both human and rabbit distal colonic muscles to these inflammatory mediators have a similar pharmacological basis. All muscle types exhibited low passive tension and developed active tension in the range 0.8-1.2 Lo. These data strongly support the belief that after the onset of an induced colitis, the rabbit colon has value as a predictive model for the study of inflammatory mediator-induced colonic motility changes in humans.\r"

Pregnant rats were administered cortisone acetate, 20 mg/100 g of body weight, or normal saline by daily IP injection from day 18-21 of gestation. Rat pups were taken from the mothers before suckling was initiated, fed a simulated rat milk formula, and subjected to daily ischemic insults to produce an animal model of necrotizing enterocolitis. Both morbidity and the mortality rates were significantly improved with prenatal cortisone treatment. Maturation of the intestinal mucosal barrier was accelerated with the cortisone treatment as measured by decreased serum concentrations of a fed antigen, ovalbumin. Aerobic bacterial colonization of the small intestine and translocation of bacteria to the liver were decreased in the pups pretreated with steroids. These changes observed in a rat model of necrotizing enterocolitis may explain the decreased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in human infants born to mothers who received corticosteroids late in gestation.\r"

For this purpose, four monoclonal antibodies against hog gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase were raised. Three monoclonal antibodies dose-dependently inhibited the ouabain-insensitive gastric ATP-ase activity. Antibody HK4001 completely inhibited the ATPase activity. In indirect immunofluorescence studies, all four monoclonal antibodies stained H+,K(+)-ATPase in gastric mucosae of various animal species. Two monoclonal antibodies including antibody HK4001 cross-reacted with H+,K(+)-ATPase located in crypts of the transverse and descending colon and rectum of rabbits. Because the other two antibodies did not cross-react with the H+,K(+)-ATPase in the colon, this colonic enzyme is similar but not identical to gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase. On the other hand, HK4001 and SCH 28080 did not inhibit ouabain-sensitive K(+)-dependent ATPase activity in the guinea pig distal colon, and the antibodies did not stain the enzyme in the tissue. Therefore, ouabain-sensitive H+/K+ antiporter in the guinea pig is not similar to ouabain-insensitive rabbit colonic H+,K(+)-ATPase.\r"

This study shows data derived from 36 adolescents (mean age +/- SD, 16.5 +/- 3.3 years; 27 males, 9 females) treated at least 6 months with 6-mercaptopurine (1.5 mg.kg-1.day-1, maximum of 75 mg/day). Sites of Crohn's disease at the start of 6-mercaptopurine therapy included 17 ileocolic, 9 pancolic, 7 small bowel, and 3 partial colon. All had received corticosteroids, sulfasalazine, antibiotics, and nutritional support for 5.0 +/- 3.0 years before administering 6-mercaptopurine, but intractable symptoms persisted. Disease activity lessened during the first year of 6-mercaptopurine, reflected by a higher Lloyd-Still disease activity score (pre, 64 +/- 9 vs. 6-mercaptopurine, 72 +/- 11; P less than 0.0001). General activity, physical examination, nutrition, and laboratory subscores all improved (P less than 0.004). Lessened disease activity occurred despite concomitant decrease in duration of prednisone use (pre, 9.5 +/- 4.2 vs. 6-mercaptopurine, 6.6 +/- 4.9 months/year; P less than 0.001) and cumulative annual prednisone exposure (pre, 3672 +/- 2106 vs. 6-mercaptopurine, 1964 +/- 1460 mg; P less than 0.0007). The frequency of perianal fistulae and abscesses also decreased (P less than 0.01) during treatment. Annual rates of hospitalization decreased in 44% of subjects during 6-mercaptopurine treatment, while increasing in only 22%. Follow-up beyond 1 year of 6-mercaptopurine treatment showed continued remission in 23 of 30 subjects. No serious complications were seen. 6-mercaptopurine is an effective long-term therapy for adolescents with intractable Crohn's disease. While inducing remission, it also has a significant steroid-sparing effect which may be of particular benefit to this population.\r"

The senna was administrated as ground senna pods mixed with milk chocolate. Danthron was also administered in this way. Chocolate-fed, senna-fed, and danthron-fed rats were supplied with usual feed, supplemented with chocolate, chocolate adulterated with ground senna pods, and chocolate adulterated with danthron, respectively. A group of control rats had no supplement. Perivascular nerve stimulation elicited frequency-dependent vasoconstriction of the mesenteric bed. There were no significant differences in responsiveness to perivascular nerve stimulation among mesenteric beds from the four groups. During two separate consecutive applications of capsaicin, a sensory neurotoxin, pressor responses to nerve stimulation of vascular beds from the control and chocolate-fed rats were inhibited on both occasions. However, in mesenteric beds from the senna-fed and danthron-fed groups, inhibition of pressor responses was the same on the first application of capsaicin as in the control and chocolate-fed groups, but the effect of the second application of capsaicin was greatly reduced. Calcitonin gene-related peptide, adenosine 5'-triphosphate, and adenosine mimicked the inhibitory action of capsaicin on nerve stimulation in all groups, while substance P was without effect. There was no significant difference in responsiveness to these agents among the four groups. These results suggest that senna or its metabolites may cause a sensory neuropathy of mesenteric resistance vessels and that calcitonin gene-related peptide, adenosine 5'-triphosphate, and adenosine, but not substance P, are possible candidates as mediators of the inhibitory effects induced by capsaicin.\r"

It has been suggested that leukotriene B4 may be released during ischemia/reperfusion and consequently may promote granulocyte infiltration into the mucosa. The objectives of this study were to determine whether (a) leukotriene B4 is produced in the gut mucosa during ischemia and reperfusion, and (b) inhibition of leukotriene B4 attenuates granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic intestinal mucosa. Isolated segments of cat intestine were subjected to 3 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion. Mucosal samples were obtained during baseline, ischemia at 3 hours and reperfusion at 1 hour. Leukotriene B4 production was determined by radioimmunoassay. Tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity was used to quantitate granulocyte accumulation in the mucosal samples. In untreated animals, mucosal leukotriene B4 concentration was higher at reperfusion compared with baseline levels. The reperfusion-induced increase in mucosal leukotriene B4 was entirely prevented by pretreatment with either nordihydroguaiaretic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or L663,536 (Merck-Frosst, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), two potent lipoxygenase inhibitors. Both lipoxygenase inhibitors, as well as leukotriene B4 antagonist (SC-41930) significantly attenuated the reperfusion-induced infiltration of granulocytes. These results indicate that leukotriene B4 plays an important role in mediating the granulocyte accumulation elicited by reperfusion of the ischemic bowel.\r"

  ".W": "Neurofilaments are 10-nm diameter protein fibers found within neurons and are composed predominantly of a triplet of polypeptides usually referred to as low-, medium-, and high-molecular-weight subunits. We describe the results of a study of myenteric plexus neurons using a panel of neurofilament triplet protein antibodies and indirect immunofluorescence techniques. Polyclonal antibodies to each of the three neurofilament subunits reliably stained myenteric neurons and their processes, indicating the presence of all three proteins in these cells. However, several well-characterized monoclonal antibodies to epitopes on high- and medium-molecular-weight subunits showed immunoreactivity in brain tissue but not in myenteric neurons and their processes. Some of the antibodies that do not stain recognize only phosphorylated epitopes, indicating that the level of neurofilament phosphorylation is very low in enteric neurons. Other antibodies that are not thought to be sensitive to the level of neurofilament phosphorylation show reduced or no staining of enteric neurons, suggesting the presence of immunologically distinct neurofilaments in these cells. These results suggest the presence of modified neurofilament structures in enteric neurons, possibly reflecting their unique mechanical character within the moving intestinal wall.\r"

Six patients had a high spinal lesion, 11 had a low spinal lesion, and 3 had mixed high and low spinal lesions. Patients with high spinal lesions had normal basal pressures but abnormally low squeeze pressures and impaired rectal sensation. Unlike normal subjects, there was no relationship between the depth of sphincter relaxation and the distention volumes. The external sphincter responses to rectal distention and increases in intraabdominal pressure were enhanced, and leakage of perfusion fluid was uncommon. Patients with low spinal lesions had abnormally low basal and squeeze pressures, blunted rectal sensation, and showed impaired external anal sphincter responses to rectal distention or increases in intraabdominal pressures. Most of these patients leaked the infused fluid during these maneuvers. Sphincter function in patients with mixed lesions was more severely impaired than in patients with low and high spinal lesions. Patients with mixed lesions showed abnormally low basal and squeeze pressures, impaired rectal sensation, and no external anal sphincter responses to either rectal distention or increases in intraabdominal pressure. Leakage occurred during these maneuvers in all patients with mixed lesions.\r"

In this study, the alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration in stool and the plasma clearance of alpha 1-antitrypsin in normal subjects and in a consecutive series of patients with chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, or unexplained hypoalbuminemia was determined. The normal subjects were studied in their usual state and also when they had diarrhea secondary to ingestion of lactulose, sorbitol, sodium sulfate, or phenolphthalein. The study first concluded that induced diarrhea can cause an increase in alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance; if this is not considered in establishing normal values, there may be an overdiagnosis of excess protein leakage in patients with diarrhea. Second, there is a highly significant statistical correlation (P less than 0.001) between alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and serum albumin concentration. On average, the serum albumin falls below 3.0 g/dL (30 g/L) when the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance exceeds 180 mL/day, a value that is about threefold higher than the upper limit of normal. Third, three of nine patients with microscopic/collagenous colitis had elevated clearance of alpha 1-antitrypsin; by contrast, abnormal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was not found in 23 patients with idiopathic secretory diarrhea. Fourth, fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration is not a reliable index of abnormal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance.\r"

Use of balloon tamponade was halved in somatostatin-treated patients. The average effect of somatostatin was a 41% reduction in the hazard of failure (95% confidence interval, -1% to 65%, P = 0.0545) after adjustment for the severity of liver disease, which was the only other variable having a significant influence on time to failure. There was no difference in 30-day mortality per admission (7 placebo, 9 somatostatin) or complications. It is concluded that somatostatin is safe and more effective than placebo for the control of variceal bleeding.\r"

The hepatic venous pressure gradient, heart rate, and variceal size were determined at the baseline and 3, 12, and 24 months after the beginning of therapy. Baseline values were similar in both groups. At 3 months, the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased significantly in propranolol-treated patients (from 18.1 +/- 4.2 to 15.7 +/- 3.4 mm Hg; P less than 0.05) but not in patients receiving the placebo (19.6 +/- 6.8 to 17.5 +/- 5.3 mm Hg; NS). At subsequent time intervals this gradient decreased significantly from the baseline value in both groups. Heart rate decreased significantly in the propranolol-treated group at all times (P less than 0.001). Variceal hemorrhage occurred in 13 patients (11 placebo-, 2 propranolol-treated; P less than 0.01), all of whom had a hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 12 mm Hg. In 21 patients (14 propranolol-, 7 placebo-treated) the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased to less than or equal to 12 mm Hg; none of them bled from esophageal varices, and their mortality rate also decreased. Because most of the bleeding events occurred during the first year (10 placebo-, 1 propranolol-treated; P less than 0.01), propranolol seems to have its protective effect during the period associated with the largest reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient. Because a reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient to less than 12 mm Hg protects from variceal bleeding and increases the rate of survival, this should be the aim of the pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension.\r"

This study showed that in overweight adults without primary liver disease, a weight reduction of greater than or equal to 10% corrected abnormal hepatic test results, decreased hepatosplenomegaly, and resolved some stigmata of liver disease. In similarly studied overweight patients with primary liver disease, some findings improved, but the changes did not correlate with a greater than or equal to 10% weight loss. Increased alanine aminotransferase activity was the most frequent hepatic enzyme abnormality in this population. For every 1% reduction in body weight, alanine aminotransferase activity improved by 8.1%. After other causes of liver disease are eliminated by clinical and biochemical parameters, weight reduction should be tried for overweight patients with abnormal hepatic test results in the absence of obvious primary liver disease as judged by clinical and biochemical parameters before extensive and expensive studies are undertaken.\r"

Using a soft agarose clonogenic assay, pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor also consistently stimulated (3 assays) colony formation: the peak activity occurred at a concentration of 10(-10) mol/L which caused a 150 +/- 55% (mean +/- SE, P less than 0.05) increase above control. Aprotinin had no effect on the growth of AR4-2J cells and pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor did not bind to the epidermal growth factor receptor.

  ".U": "91007097\r", 
  ".W": "The aim of this work was to investigate the first step in the vectorial translocation of bile acids from the fetus to the mother, which is the transfer across the basal (i.e., fetal-facing) plasma membrane of the trophoblast. Thus, the uptake of [14C]taurocholate by basal plasma membrane vesicles obtained from normal human term placentas was studied. Taurocholate retention into vesicles was studied using a rapid filtration technique that was modified to reduce the taurocholate binding to the filters and to the external surface of the vesicles. Using 100 mumol/L substrate, the membrane vesicles showed a temperature-dependent, Na(+)-independent transport of taurocholate into an osmotically reactive intravesicular space. The initial rate of taurocholate influx in the presence of 100 mmol/L KNO3 followed saturation kinetics (apparent Km for taurocholate = 670 +/- 128 mumol/L; Vmax = 1.86 +/- 0.28 nmol/mg protein.60 s at 37 degrees C). Over the 6.9-7.9 pH range neither internal nor external pH nor inward nor outward proton gradients affected the uptake of taurocholate. When the electrical potential difference across the basal membrane was manipulated by external anion replacement (Cl-, SCN-, SO4(2-), or NO3-) or by valinomycin-induced K(+)-diffusion potential (vesicle inside negative), taurocholate uptake was not significantly modified. Taurocholate uptake was cis-inhibited in the presence of 1 mmol/L glycocholate, 0.5 mmol/L 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate and 0.5 mmol/L sulfobromophthalein. However, 1 mmol/L probenecid or 0.5 mmol/L p-aminohippurate had no effect. Moreover, preloading the vesicles with 100 mmol/L HCO3- (but not with 100 mmol/L Cl- or 50 mmol/L SO4(2-) induced a significant enhancement in the initial rate of taurocholate uptake. In summary, these findings provide strong evidence for the presence of an electroneutral transport system for taurocholate in the basal plasma membrane of human chorionic trophoblast. They also suggest that this is likely to be an anion-exchange system.\r"

Stone disintegration was achieved in 99 of these patients (99%) with a mean (+/- SD) maximum fragment size of 5.1 +/- 4.1 mm. Significant differences were found when the mean (+/- SD) fragment sizes of single stones less than or equal to 20 mm (4.2 +/- 2.5 mm) were compared with those of single stones greater than 20 mm (5.8 +/- 3.4 mm; P less than 0.05) and multiple stones (6.2 +/- 3.8 mm; P less than 0.05), respectively. None of the patients required anesthesia, analgesics, or sedatives before or during the treatment. The stone-free rates for all patients followed up for up to 4-12 months (mean +/- SD, 10.7 +/- 2.9 months) were 18% (1 month), 25% (2 months), 38% (4 months), 52% (8 months), and 67% (12 months). Partly significant differences were obtained in stone-free rates for single stones (less than or equal to 20 mm) compared with larger stones (greater than 20 mm) and multiple stones (P less than 0.05), respectively. Serious adverse reactions (i.e., cholestasis and pancreatitis) were observed in only 3 patients (3%). These conditions were induced by fragment impaction in the common bile duct. In 2 of these patients, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic sphincterotomy was required. It is concluded that piezoelectrically generated shock waves are suitable for the effective and safe disintegration of gallbladder stones in humans. The anesthesia-free and analgesia-free shock-wave application opens up the possibility to perform biliary lithotripsy as an outpatient procedure. The stone-free rate achieved in combination with oral bile acids is most promising for single stones (less than or equal to 20 mm).\r"

Five patients with a nasobiliary drain in the right hepatic duct were studied. Three basal samples of bile were collected, each over a 15-minute period. Synthetic human secretin was then infused IV at 0.05 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 for 45 minutes followed by 0.5 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 for 45 minutes. Bile was sampled over 15-minute periods. To document return to baseline conditions, two further samples of bile were obtained over 15-minute periods 2 hours after the infusion was terminated. Bile acid concentration was determined by an enzymatic method; pH and PCO2 were measured with an automated analyzer. Total calcium was determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry and ionized calcium by an ion-specific electrode. Bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations were calculated using Henry's law and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The fraction of bile sampled by the catheter was determined by Indocyanin Green recovery at the end of the experiment. Secretin caused an increase in bile flow and bicarbonate output. Bicarbonate concentrations increased from 26 +/- 3 mmol/L to 41 +/- 3 mmol/L (P less than 0.05), and chloride concentrations decreased. Mean bile acid concentrations declined significantly from 14.6 +/- 2 mmol/L to 4.7 +/- 1 mmol/L (P less than 0.05). Ionized calcium concentrations decreased from 0.7 +/- 0.005 mmol/L to 0.5 +/- 0.02 mmol/L (P less than 0.05) while pH increased significantly from 7.44 +/- 0.06 to 7.6 +/- 0.04 (P less than 0.05). Carbonate concentrations increased significantly from 0.15 +/- 0.02 mmol/L to 0.26 +/- 0.03 mmol/L, and the ion product for calcium carbonate increased significantly from 0.099 +/- 0.002 (mmol/L)2 to 0.135 +/- 0.015 (mmol/L)2 (P less than 0.05). Synthetic human secretin augments the ion product of calcium and carbonate in human hepatic bile, increasing the tendency for calcium carbonate precipitation.\r"

  ".U": "91007100\r", 
  ".W": "The most recognized function of the human gallbladder is to store bile. However, this organ is not a static reservoir. It actively modifies bile by two processes: concentration and acidification. This study was designed to simultaneously evaluate the relationship between these two physiological processes in the normal human gallbladder and to define their effects on biliary cholesterol and calcium solubility. Bile was sampled directly from the gallbladder of 78 morbidly obese patients undergoing elective gastric bypass procedures. All had negative results of intra-operative ultrasound examinations for sludge and gallstones, normal liver function tests, and no history of hepatobiliary disease. Bile salt concentrations, an indirect index of concentration by the gallbladder, ranged from 15.1-272.8 mmol/L. As [bile salt] increased, [Na+], [K+], free [Ca2+], [cholesterol], [phospholipid], and [total lipid] increased linearly; [Cl-1] decreased linearly. Molar percent cholesterol decreased from 17.2% in dilute bile to 10.1% in fully concentrated bile, suggesting that cholesterol was absorbed by the gallbladder. As bile was concentrated, cholesterol saturation index decreased curvilinearly from a maximum of 3.7 in dilute bile to 1.0-1.5 in concentrated bile. Concentration of gallbladder bile was accompanied by progressive acidification. Bile pH decreased linearly with increasing [bile salt]; [CO3(2-)] decreased curvilinearly. Despite increasing [Ca2+], CaCO3 saturation index decreased curvilinearly with increasing [bile salt] from a maximum of 3.62 in dilute bile to a minimum of 0.12 in concentrated and acidified bile. CaCO3 saturation index also decreased exponentially with decreasing pH. This study concludes that concentration of bile enhances cholesterol solubility while acidification enhances calcium salt solubility. By increasing the solubilities of these two species, gallbladder mucosal function may play a key role in preventing gallstone formation.\r"

This decrease is not associated with alterations in the total amounts of the contractile proteins actin and myosin. The present study was designed to determine if cholesterol feeding results in alterations in the isoforms of actin and/or myosin heavy chain in gallbladder smooth muscle. Control prairie dogs were fed a trace-cholesterol diet and test animals were fed a high (1.2%)-cholesterol diet for 8 days. Although the proportion of beta-actin was unchanged, the proportion of alpha-actin in the gallbladder was less in the animals fed the high-cholesterol diet (32.6% +/- 1.5% in the control animals and 24.6% +/- 0.4% in the diet animals). On the other hand, the proportion of gamma-actin was significantly greater in the cholesterol-fed animals. There were no significant differences in the proportions of the myosin heavy-chain isoforms between the two groups. Also, there was no change in the volume fraction of smooth muscle in the gallbladders from the two groups. Thus, cholesterol feeding induces a shift in actin isoforms at the same time that there is a decrease in contractility. Whether the altered pattern of actin isoforms is related to the functional changes remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "During extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy, the pressure profile, which is generated by the lithotriptor, determines the risk of tissue damage. In the present study, the pressure distribution of a lithotriptor (Lithostar; Siemens A.G., Erlangen, Federal Republic of Germany) was investigated in 10 pigs, five of which had gallstones surgically implanted into the gallbladder. The in vivo values were compared with in vitro data. Measurements were carried out along the shock-wave transmission path at the focus within the gallbladder, the adjacent liver, the diaphragmatic surface of the right lung, and the shock-wave exit site from the skin. Interposition of ribs did not cause a significant decrease in focal positive pressure. However, a gallstone positioned in the focus caused a 30%-65% reduction in pressure, recorded immediately behind the stone. Pressures obtained in vivo were always 15%-25% lower than those measured in vitro. The spatial distributions of the positive pressure in vivo and in vitro were almost identical. There was a high correlation between the pressures in vitro and in vivo (r = 0.88; P less than or equal to 0.01). This justifies assessment of shock-wave energies generated during biliary lithotripsy by extrapolation of in vitro data. It is concluded that it is possible to characterize different lithotriptors by in vitro pressure profile measurements.\r"

However, characteristic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography radiographic findings associated with malignant strictures are frequently not specific and cytological confirmation becomes essential for the diagnosis. Unfortunately, the current overall diagnostic yield of positive cytology in such circumstances ranges from 18%-56% depending on the technique. A new brush device has been designed which is uniquely adapted to pancreaticobiliary strictures of varying anatomical configurations. This study shows results using this new cytology brush in a series of 53 patients with pancreaticobiliary malignancy. A significant improvement in the cytological yield of tumor confirmation was obtained with a diagnostic sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 100% using the new brush technique.\r"

  ".W": "Fatty meal sonography has been suggested to assess patients with biliary pain after cholecystectomy, but the effects of gallbladder removal on biliary dynamics has not been studied prospectively. Before elective cholecystectomy, 25 patients had their common hepatic ducts' diameter measured by ultrasonography before and after a fat stimulus. In 23, tests were repeated 1 month, 1 year, and 5 years after surgery. In preoperative studies, 5 patients showed dilatation after fat and 2 of these had stones in the common bile duct. However, another 4 patients with stones or sludge in the duct did not show dilatation, so that the response to fat was a poor indicator of patients requiring common bile duct exploration. No patient had major symptoms after surgery. At 1 month and 12 months, the response to fat was variable with more than half of those tested showing no decrease in duct size. A more consistent pattern emerged at 5 years, when 14 of 18 patients tested showed a decrease in common hepatic duct after fat; 3 were unchanged and 1 increased by 1 mm. The response to fat was less consistent and more difficult to measure in the common bile duct, even 5 years after operation. It was concluded that not all patients with indications for exploration of the common bile duct on operative cholangiography show a dilatation response to fat on preoperative testing. Also, fatty meal sonography should be used with caution because the response to fat in asymptomatic patients soon after operation is unpredictable, with occasional patients showing dilation without apparent obstruction. Measurement of common hepatic duct is preferred to common bile duct and increases in diameter of 1 mm are probably not significant.\r"

However, the mechanism of this uncoupling phenomenon is still unclear. This study shows a comparison of the effects of ampicillin (18 mumol/100g body wt), sulfated taurolithocholic acid (0.2 and 1.0 mumol/100 g body wt), and indocyanine green (0.6 mumol/100 g body wt) in control and Groningen Yellow-Wistar rats with chronic (8 days) biliary drainage. Groningen Yellow rats have a hereditary defect in hepatobiliary transport of various organic anions. Bile secretion, but not hepatic uptake, of the three organic anions was strongly impaired in Groningen Yellow rats compared with controls. Ampicillin and sulfated taurolithocholic acid caused a strong uncoupling in control rats but had no effect or a much smaller effect on lipid secretion in Groningen Yellow rats. Indocyanine green did not affect lipid secretion, in either control or in Groningen Yellow rats. Gel-filtration chromatography of bile showed a specific coelution of ampicillin and sulfated taurolithocholic acid with the bile acid fraction, whereas indocyanine green coeluted with the phospholipid/cholesterol fraction. This study concludes that the uncoupling by ampicillin and sulfated taurolithocholic acid occurs after their secretion into bile and is caused by interaction of these compounds with bile acids. It is hypothesized that this interaction inhibits the capacity of bile acids to induce secretion of phospholipids and cholesterol into the bile.\r"

  ".W": "Gallbladder mucin is a densely glycosylated macro-molecule that promotes cholesterol gallstone formation in experimental animals and in humans. Bovine gallbladder mucin structure was studied after chemical deglycosylation by treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at 23 degrees C for 3 hours. Deglycosylated mucin contained less than 5% of the amino sugar and neutral hexose content of native mucin. Electrophoretic and molecular sieve chromatographic analyses indicated that significant cleavage of the mucin polypeptide core had occurred during deglycosylation. Deglycosylated mucin was separated into three major fractions by reverse-phase chromatography, one of which was enriched with respect to threonine and proline. Tryptic peptides prepared from this fraction were purified by molecular sieve and reverse-phase chromatography, and the amino acid sequences (8-20 residues) of the four principal tryptic peptides were determined. These peptides contained 65%-75% threonine and proline residues and demonstrated 80%-100% sequence similarity. These data provide the first information on the primary structure of gallbladder mucin and suggest that repeating amino acid sequences occur in this protein. Comparison of gallbladder mucin peptide structure with the consensus repeat sequence of human intestinal mucin showed approximately 60% sequence similarity. It was concluded that mammalian gastrointestinal mucins may be derived from a common ancestral gene.\r"

The lesion often is not seen endoscopically. Left gastric angiography in one patient with hematemesis showed a convoluted and ectatic artery in the gastric fundus, which proved to be caliber-persistent artery of the stomach on pathological examination. The tortuosity of the abnormal vessel in this condition has been attributed to artefactual contraction of the stomach following excision and formalin fixation. This is the first reported case in which a pathologically proven lesion has been clearly visualized by angiography. This demonstrates that the submucosal vessel is truly and not artifactually sinuous. It is proposed that angiographic demonstration of a nontapering, convoluted artery in the territory of the left gastric artery is highly suggestive of caliber-persistent artery of the stomach.\r"

A hypoechoic or anechoic duct-like lesion immediately adjacent to the anorectal lumen compatible with a fistula was found in 32 patients. A communication between the fistulous tract and adjacent structures such as the skin, anal canal, or vagina was detected in all 32 patients. An anechoic cavity adjacent to or communicating with the fistula was visualized in 29 of the 36 patients. A fistula was visualized in the remaining seven patients with no evidence of an abscess. This anechoic cavity compatible with an abscess was surgically confirmed in 14 of 17 patients. We judged the extent and configuration of the abnormalities to be more clearly visualized by ES when results were compared with fistulography in five patients. There were no ES complications, and we conclude that ES is the preferred diagnostic procedure in patients with peri-rectal pathology because of the low risk of bacterial dissemination and low incidence of patient discomfort. Utilizing ES after non-surgical treatment was successful in 19 patients for documentation of the response to therapy.\r"

(2) Duodeno-jejunal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause for bleeding, and these lesions can be conveniently cauterized through the endoscope. (3) An efficient sequence of steps for diagnosis of patients with this problem includes push-enteroscopy when the initial EGD and colonoscopy are normal followed by small bowel radiography. Mesenteric angiography and intraoperative enteroscopy can be reserved for patients with severe bleeding when push-enteroscopy and small bowel radiography are negative.

  ".W": "Before surgery, 12 patients with suspected leiomyoma and 12 patients with suspected leiomyosarcoma were studied by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), endoscopy, and barium swallow. The results were correlated with surgery and histology. Ten leiomyomas, one benign gastric ulcer, one carcinoid metastasis, eight leiomyosarcomas, two leiomyoblastomas, one mucus secreting adenocarcinoma, and one bronchial carcinoma were diagnosed. Eighteen additional patients suspected to have benign submucosal lesions by endoscopy and barium meal were treated non-surgically, and studied by EUS and CT. EUS was superior to other imaging techniques in the detection, staging, and follow-up of submucosal smooth muscle tumors because of clear imaging of the intramural abnormality and adjacent lymph nodes.\r"

The procedure was performed in 93 patients with an overall success rate of 94%. However, because many accessories were in a developmental stage, entrapment of stones was not always possible on the first attempt, and the procedure was repeated in some patients a second or third time. During the interim, while awaiting another attempt at lithotripsy, cholangitis was prevented by leaving a prosthesis in place. A variety of lithotriptor models from different manufacturers have proven effective. We recommend that endoscopists use these devices to rid the bile duct of retained stones.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-two patients with esophageal involvement by lung cancer were managed by endoscopic intubation. In 22 patients with extrinsic esophageal strictures, the success rate of intubation was 91%, and 82% were discharged with their dysphagia relieved and esophageal patency restored. The mean survival rate was 4.4 months. In 10 patients with esophago-bronchial fistulas, 3 had the fistulous tract obliterated and lived a mean of 5 months. This low success rate of closing fistulas is due to failure to seal off the space between the stent and the fistula because of absence of tumor-associated stenosis. The overall morbidity rate was 28.1% (18.8% perforation, 6.3% hemorrhage, and 3.1% tracheal obstruction). The overall mortality rate was 18.8%. Although complications were more frequent than in primary esophageal tumors, endoscopic intubation was the only way to palliate this desperate condition and provided 66.6% of patients with relief of symptoms, nutritional improvement, and a mean survival time of 4.5 months.\r"

All patients presented with epigastric pain. Other symptoms included jaundice in 31% (5 of 16) and fever in 12.5% (2 of 16). Praziquantel given at 25 mg/kg for three doses in 1 day were administered. Three consecutive stool tests were performed 3 months after treatment and were negative in 87.5% (14 of 16). ERCP studies were repeated at a mean interval of 31.6 months (range, 8 to 69 months). Measurements of the bile ducts on retrograde cholangiograms before and after treatment were compared using the paired Student's t test. Filling defects and blunting of the terminal bile ducts seen on the initial cholangiogram, interpreted as the presence of adult worms, disappeared after treatment. However, there was no significant change between pre- and post-treatment measurement of bile duct caliber. Bile duct dilation, irregularities, and ductal proliferation persisted despite eradication of the parasite.\r"

The appropriate duct was cannulated in 95% of cases. Mild pancreatitis occurred in two patients after ERCP. Endoscopic papillotomy was successful in five patients. ERCP plays an important part in the investigation of unexplained biliary tract and pancreatic disease. It rarely demonstrates abnormal pathology in patients with otherwise unexplained abdominal pain.\r"

  ".W": "This study questioned whether clinicians could determine the success of esophageal dilation accurately without the aid of fluoroscopy. Twenty patients were enrolled with the diagnosis of distal esophageal stenosis, including benign peptic stricture (17), Schatski's ring (2), and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (1). Dilation attempts using only Maloney dilators were monitored fluoroscopically by the principle investigator, the physician and patient being unaware of the findings. Physicians then predicted whether or not their dilations were successful, and they examined various features to determine their usefulness in predicting successful dilation. They were able to predict successful dilation accurately in 97% of the cases studied; however, their predictions of unsuccessful dilation were correct only 60% of the time. Features helpful in predicting passage included easy passage of the dilator (98%) and the patient feeling the dilator in the stomach (95%). Excessive resistance suggesting unsuccessful passage was an unreliable feature and was often due to the dilator curling in the stomach. When Maloney dilators are used to dilate simple distal strictures, if the physician predicts successful passage, he is reliably accurate without the use of fluoroscopy; however, if unsuccessful passage is suspected, fluoroscopy must be used for confirmation.\r"

  ".W": "Disposable plastic biopsy forceps were compared prospectively to reusable stainless steel forceps. Thirty consecutive patients underwent a total of 249 biopsies, 124 with the disposable forceps, and 125 with reusable forceps. Biopsy locations included the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and common bile duct. Specimens were compared microscopically to determine overall surface area, depth, adequacy, and diagnostic result. The disposable biopsy forceps yielded specimens which were 37% smaller when compared with the reusable forceps. In five of the comparisons, minor differences in histological findings were noted between the two groups of biopsy specimens, but these differences did not alter the pathological diagnosis. However, in three cases in which superficial specimens were obtained, an underlying carcinoma was missed with the disposable forceps. Our study documents the utility of disposable biopsy forceps for mucosal lesions. In addition, there were 11 mechanical failures in 38 biopsy attempts with the plastic biopsy forceps. These forceps appear to be limited in their capacity to obtain adequate specimens from firm tissue or when submucosal biopsy samples are required, and they will require refinements in design to duplicate specimen quality obtained by traditional reusable forceps. Disposable forceps are particularly suitable for biopsy of mucosal lesions in patients with possible communicable disease, and they should help to reduce cross-contamination in the gastroenterology laboratory.\r"
