MRI was as effective as contrast-enhanced CT in the detection of vascular tumour components, but was less sensitive than angiography. MRI was superior to CT in delineating the exact extent of the lesions, for example contact with the arachnoid surface. Even if a cystic tumour component is absent, MRI can provide helpful criteria for differential diagnosis; in particular, T2 values allow differentiation from meningiomas. In three patients additionally administered gadolinium (Gd) diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (DTPA) the angiomatous parts of the tumour showed a remarkable decrease in T1 value, but the time dependence of the enhancement was not the same as that seen in dynamic CT.\r"

Bisexuals were more likely than lesbians to report an abnormal Papanicolaou smear, cystitis, genital herpes, gonorrhea and vaginal infections. When sexual orientation was controlled for, most, but not all, of these differences were associated with a difference in reported frequency of (prior) coitus. Despite the lower risk of certain problems, however, the lesbians who reported no previous coitus did report the occurrence of vaginitis, abnormal Papanicolaou smears and genital herpes. There were no differences in past oral contraceptive use, endometriosis, menstrual dysfunction or breast disease. The lesbian group reported a greater percentage of hysterectomies. These data suggest that, overall, the sexual behaviors of lesbians are associated with a lower risk of most sexually transmitted diseases.\r"

All the patients underwent thermographic, mammographic and physical examinations performed under standard conditions and, when indicated, complementary radiographic (spot/magnified pictures), ultrasound and cytologic tests. Of the 294 in situ, microinvasive and nonpalpable cancers diagnosed in this study, 60-70% generated significant thermal anomalies that, in most cases, consisted of distorted thermovascular patterns. A tentative explanation for these clinical observations was formed from intramammary measurements of temperature and blood flow performed on seven patients and was based on recent experimental data on the origin of vascular reactions associated with cancer growth. This study clearly showed that thermography may contribute to the early detection of breast cancer and to the identification of women at high risk of developing breast cancer. Two hundred four (21.3%) of the 958 patients who, on their first visit, had an abnormal thermogram but no findings at physical examination or mammography developed cancer within the next three years (length of follow-up, 4-41 months).\r"

There were significant differences between DES-exposed women and their sisters in major depression and major recurrent depression. Papanicolaou controls were more depressed in comparison to sister controls. However, there were no significant differences in depression between Papanicolaou controls and the DES exposed, suggesting that major and recurrent depressions are more likely to result from concern about reproductive and other gynecologic problems than from the hormonal effects of intrauterine exposure to DES. Differences in amphetamine abuse/dependence were also noted between the DES exposed and the sister controls.\r"

Thecosis, also known as thecomatosis and stromal thecosis, is a complex assortment of types of ovarian stromal proliferation associated with various types and amounts of hormonal activity. A patient had progressive virilization that began about seven years after menarche. Nonetheless, she had six pregnancies and bore five normal living children. Her last child, a female, was not affected by the high maternal testosterone levels. The patient's virilization was associated with an ovarian stromal hyperplasia classified as combined thecosis. In this case, as in some others, there was reason to suspect a genetic basis for such progressive virilization with retained fertility; an analysis of it provides insight into the complex nature of ovarian stromal hyperplasia and hormonal activity.\r"

The test is not only unstandardized, but agreement does not exist as to the lower limits of normal penetration rates. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is considerable doubt as to whether any correlation exists between SPA results and the behavior of sperm in an in vitro laboratory situation. We investigated this question by examining the SPA results and the subsequent fertilization and cleavage rates in the in vitro fertilization program at Pennsylvania Hospital. The sperm from men whose SPA results were 11% or more fertilized 86% of the morphologically normal and mature human oocytes to which they were exposed. Men whose SPA scores ranged from 1% through 10% fertilized 65% of human oocytes, and men whose sperm failed to penetrate hamster eggs still were able to fertilize 41% of the human oocytes. The differences between these groups are statistically significant. This information can be of practical prognostic value during in vitro fertilization cycles in which the number of mature oocytes seen ultrasonographically appears to be at a minimum.\r"

However, the high frequency of positive outpatient cultures following discharge has cast doubt on the adequacy of in-hospital care and, at the same time, has concentrated attention on follow-up care. In a randomized, prospective study, we evaluated the effects of in-hospital management and outpatient nitrofurantoin on subsequent urine cultures. The overall frequency of positive cultures following discharge from the hospital was 38%. However, appropriate antibiotic selection, a negative follow-up in-hospital culture and nitrofurantoin suppression reduced the rate to 8% (P less than .01). Nitrofurantoin did not reduce the rate of positive cultures if antibiotic selection was inappropriate or if the in-hospital follow-up culture was positive. These results suggest that more aggressive management of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy may be indicated and that suppressive therapy cannot compensate for inappropriate in-hospital management.\r"

The incidence of false-positive tests was similar to that in previous reports. The corrected perinatal mortality rate for the study population was 1.5 per 1,000 births. The time required for an adequate uterine response was 23.8 +/- 15.2 minutes, with 87.5% of patients responding in less than 30 minutes. The BSCST appears to be a reasonable alternative to the OCT, with elimination of the intravenous line and oxytocin administration and with a shorter testing time.\r"

The test was applied in 88 women close to full term and to 67 women in labor. Overall, the sensitivity of the test was 82.3% and specificity, 89.1%. The results were statistically significant in both late pregnancy and labor. A positive test implies an impending risk of cord compression and is an indication for close electronic fetal monitoring, particularly during labor. Routine use of the nuchal cord test can contribute to decreasing perinatal morbidity and mortality by diminishing the impact of cord problems.\r"

The inhibitory effect on the superoxide response to FMLP correlated with inhibition of specific 3H-FMLP binding. Piroxicam did not inhibit production of leukotriene B4 stimulated either by A23187 or by FMLP with arachidonic acid. Piroxicam did not inhibit phospholipid methylation. Since piroxicam inhibited neither the superoxide response to zymosan, a membrane receptor mediated response, nor phospholipid methylation, the effect of this drug on FMLP receptor binding appears to be relatively selective. Our data also exclude a significant effect of piroxicam on activation of protein kinase C or the NADPH oxidase of mononuclear phagocytes.\r"

Total serum IgA and polymeric IgA (p-IgA) levels were elevated in 23 and 11% of patients with RA, respectively. Their respective mean concentrations in serum were significantly elevated compared to normal values (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.004). A preferential increase in polymeric rather than monomeric IgA was observed. IgA-RF, detected by a solid phase ELISA, was found in 71% and was associated with decreased grip strength (p less than 0.005), active disease (p less than 0.05), increased p-IgA level (p less than 0.001), elevated p-IgA:total IgA ratio (p less than 0.05), the presence of IgA-CIC (p less than 0.005) and IgM-RF (p less than 0.005). Complement fixing IgA-CIC were detected in 40% of patients by IgA specific conglutinin and anti-C3 binding solid phase ELISA. High molecular weight IgA species precipitated by 2.5% polyethylene glycol from RA sera positive for IgA-CIC were shown to be IgA-RF complexed to IgG. Taken together, our results suggest that IgA-RF are essentially polymeric in nature and circulate as IgA-RF-IgG immune complexes. Although the presence of IgA-CIC was not associated with disease activity, IgA-CIC activated C3 and thus are potentially pathogenic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This deformity measure has good interobserver reliability (r = 0.72) and appears stable over time. The JAM score measures joint characteristics distinct from tenderness and swelling and correlates strongly with functional measures (walk time, grip strength and self-reported functional status). Joint deformity should be considered when interpreting functional measures for patients with RA.\r"

Vasculitis presented primarily as cutaneous lesions with ulceration and/or mononeuritis multiplex, and 6 patients had severe systemic manifestations. Vasculitis was histopathologically documented in 6 cases in biopsies of skin (4 of 4), muscle (2 of 3) and sural nerve (3 of 3). Patients with systemic sclerosis with CREST syndrome and SS appear to be at increased risk to develop vasculitis.\r"

Although toxicity is uncommon in healthy subjects, little is known concerning the extent of absorption of magnesium after a cathartic dose of magnesium sulfate. The bioavailability of magnesium following a large oral dose of magnesium sulfate in normal volunteers was examined in the present investigation. Baseline 24-hour urinary excretion rates of magnesium and creatinine were determined over 3 consecutive days in 6 healthy men. The oral administration of 13.9 g (56.5 mmoles) magnesium sulfate U.S.P., in 4 equal hourly increments, resulted in the urinary excretion (corrected for baseline excretion rate) of 4.0 +/- 2.9% (mean +/- SD) of the dose of magnesium during the first 24 hours and 6.9 +/- 7.0% of the dose during a 72-hour interval. Magnesium sulfate administration had no effect on the 24-hour urinary excretion rate of creatinine. The baseline excretion rate of magnesium was significantly correlated with that of creatinine (r = 0.875) and inorganic sulfate (r = 0.921). All of the subjects experienced mild or moderate diarrhea. Therefore, magnesium is absorbed to a limited and variable extent in healthy adults following a cathartic dose of magnesium sulfate.\r"

The limitations of this earlier study were: irregular nitrogen absorption in the malabsorption patients, high nitrogen intake, and failure to match FAA to control formula (hydrolyzed casein; CAS; Criticare-HN) with respect to kcal/nitrogen. A more critical test of FAA quality was sought in the current study. Four healthy males received the minimal daily nitrogen requirements (0.6 g protein/kg) from either FAA or CAS in a 10-day balance study; a second balance on the alternate formula followed. Maintenance energy, minerals, and vitamins were supplied in each period. The results indicated a higher apparent nitrogen absorption (p less than 0.05) from FAA relative to CAS in the first 5 days of the balance, although these differences were no longer present in the remaining 5 days of the period. Urinary total nitrogen increased on FAA, most of which could be accounted for by urea nitrogen; urinary creatinine nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and uric acid nitrogen were nearly identical between formulas. The unmeasured fraction of urinary nitrogen was markedly diminished on FAA while the urea nitrogen to total nitrogen ratio was significantly increased (p less than 0.05) compared to CAS. During the initial 5 days of study nitrogen balance was lower on FAA than on CAS and this difference became significant during the last 5 days of the period (mean +/- SD for FAA = -0.42 +/- 0.59 g/D vs CAS = 0.98 +/- 0.30 g/day, p less than 0.001). Hyperglycinemia was consistently present during FAA infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A blood filter containing immobilized heparinase, a heparin specific enzyme, was used to degrade heparin into small fragments which have significantly less anticoagulant activity than the parent compound. The heparinase filter was tested in the extracorporeal circuit during the hemodialysis of adult sheep. At a blood flow of 200 ml/min, the clearance of heparin varied from 50 to 70 ml/min (N = 16) depending on the amount of immobilized heparinase in the filter. Hemolysis was insignificant as measured by the animals' red cell counts, hematocrit, total hemoglobin and a plasma-free hemoglobin value of 89 +/- 33 mg/dl (N = 16) (less than 1% of the total hemoglobin). The white cell counts dropped to 47 +/- 7% (N = 16) of the initial value at 20 minutes and rebounded to 72 +/- 10% (N = 16) after one hour. The platelet counts decreased to 55 +/- 8% (N = 16) of the initial value after one hour. No change in heparin clearance was observed when reactors were used repeatedly in adult sheep over a 10 week period. The red cell counts, white cell counts, platelet counts, total hemoglobin and hematocrit did not change after 10 weeks of exposure to the device. These results suggest that with further study, heparinase may be useful in removing heparin used to anticoagulate blood in extracorporeal circuits.\r"

Following AII infusion (0.5 ng/kg/min) into the L renal artery, urinary Na excretion decreased and osmolality increased slightly ipsilaterally, whereas Na excretion did not change significantly and osmolality decreased in the right (R) kidney. PPF was significantly lower in the L compared to the R kidney. When saline loading was superimposed on L intrarenal AII infusion, there was a blunted natriuretic response ipsilaterally with a significantly smaller decrease in urine osmolality compared with the R kidney. PPF increased significantly in the R, but not in the L kidney. Finally, AII blockade with saralasin prior to AII infusion and saline loading prevented the differences between the two kidneys, including PPF. In all groups GFR and renal blood flow did not differ between the two kidneys before or after AII. These data suggest that AII regulates regional blood flow in the medulla, and that the exogenously administered AII induces papillary ischemia, which serves to preserve medullary hypertonicity, preventing an increase in PPF during saline loading, and possibly contributing to the diminished natriuretic response.\r"

The response to infusion of hypertonic saline is enhanced by salt depletion and attenuated by salt loading, but has not previously been investigated in pathophysiological states where expanded extracellular fluid volume due to salt retention is associated with avid, renal sodium reabsorption. The renal response following intrarenal infusions of hypertonic saline was investigated in five control dogs and eleven dogs with partial constriction of the thoracic portion of their inferior vena cava, which resulted in salt retention and the formation of ascites. Intrarenal infusion of hypertonic saline induced significant reductions in RBF and GFR in both control and caval constricted dogs. The extent of these reductions were positively correlated with baseline renal function. An intravenous infusion of 50 ml/kg of 0.9% sodium chloride, which abolished the vasoconstrictor response in normal dogs, failed to abolish the decrease in RBF and GFR in response to intrarenal hypertonic saline infusion in dogs with ascites which had an initial vasoconstrictor response. We conclude that the potential for TGF is preserved in early stages of caval constriction syndrome in dogs, but that this potential activity decreases when basal renal function decreases.\r"

Steroid-induced restoration of near normal levels of proteinuria is characterized by the appearance in urines of isoalbumins with a pI still more anionic than the normal. In our search for an explanation for the pI changes, we used preparative isoelectric focusing in granulated gels to split the microheterogeneous bands obtained from nine MCN-affected children into four fractions (A1, A2, A3, A4) with decreasing pI from 5.8 to 4.0 and we have determined their fatty acid content. The least anionic fraction, A1, was the most defatted, followed by A2, A3 and A4 in which fatty acid content progressively increased, A4 being the most fatted fraction. Accordingly, the mean content of fatty acids in urinary albumin in proteinuric children was lower than in both the remission phase and in normal children (2.17 +/- 0.03 vs. 20.91 +/- 0.38 and 20.94 +/- 0.39, respectively) and was lower by a factor of 4 compared to serum albumin in the same phase of the disease (2.17 +/- 0.03 vs. 8.59 +/- 1.64). Among medium and long-chain fatty acids, the ratio between serum and urinary albumin was the highest for linoleic acid (approximately 7), followed by that of oleic acid, palmitic acid and lauric acid. At variance in five other patients affected by non-MCN nephrotic syndrome this ratio was for practically all FAs about 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fluid identical in composition and purity to that used in peritoneal dialysis was continuously circulated (single-pass) at 16.6 cc/min through the dialysis compartment of a 0.43 m2 flat plate PAN membrane dialyzer. Whole blood clearances for urea, creatinine and phosphate averaged 25.3 +/- 4.4 cc/min, 24.1 +/- 5.5 cc/min and 21.3 +/- 5.6 cc/min, respectively. Over the range of blood flows studied (50 to 190 cc/min) clearances of these solutes were independent of blood flow rate but rather were determined by both dialysate flow rate and ultrafiltration rate. In contrast net fluxes of calcium and sodium were correlated only with ultrafiltration rate. Bicarbonate loss was 0.52 +/- 0.11 mEq/min; K+ balance varied with dialysate K+; glucose uptake from dialysate was 107 +/- 24.0 mg/min. In fresh non-clotting dialyzers, mean ultrafiltration rate was 8.1 cc/min. At QBi of 70 to 190 cc/min, dialysate and blood solute equilibrate yielding a total clearance equal to the dialysate outflow, or 25 cc/min, that is, the sum of dialysate flow rate plus ultrafiltration rate. In comparison to currently used continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH), the exceptionally-high solute clearances obtained with continuous hemodialysis constitute a significant improvement in continuous renal replacement therapy.\r"

Previous studies, however, suggest dissimilar pathways of delivery to their sites of action. Though not rigorously tested, this potential disparity might cause them to differ when used in azotemia. We, therefore, assessed the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of intravenously administered furosemide and bumetanide in ten adult patients with stable, chronic renal insufficiency (mean creatinine clearance = 14.1 +/- 2.0 ml/min/1.73 m2) in a randomized, cross-over study during controlled sodium intake. Our goals were to assess differences in diuretic effectiveness and in so doing to determine the dose required to produce a maximal response. The mean diuretic doses of 172 and 4.3 mg for furosemide and bumetanide, respectively (ratio = 40:1) were sufficient to produce a maximum response. Despite similarities in maximal fractional excretion of sodium (18.2 +/- 2.6% with furosemide vs. 19.4 +/- 4.5% with bumetanide, P = 0.687) demonstrating an equal tubular responsiveness to both drugs, overall response as quantified by cumulative natriuresis in the initial eight hour period was 52% greater with furosemide (108 +/- 17 vs. 71 +/- 7 mEq; P = 0.042). The difference in total excreted sodium was accounted for by a preserved nonrenal clearance of bumetanide (113 +/- 12 compared to 53 +/- 5 ml/min for furosemide, P = 0.001) which resulted in relatively less bumetanide in serum available to be delivered into the urine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Metabolic studies revealed that GN and GN+CH rats developed proteinuria, elevations in serum creatinine and blood pressure (P less than 0.05). GN+CH resulted in significant reductions in two kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below values in C, and GFR in the unclipped kidney was markedly reduced when compared to CH. The glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and the pressure gradient( (delta P) were elevated approximately 4 to 5 mm Hg in GN and CH rats and 6 mm Hg above GN and CH values in the GN+CH rats. The glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (LpA) was reduced to approximately 40% of C in both GN and GN+CH in spite of further increases in delta P. Surface nephron filtration rate was similar in all groups, suggesting glomerular dysfunction was primarily in nephrons below the surface in GN+CH. Morphologic evaluation revealed that GN+CH exhibited a combination of diffuse and focally sclerotic lesions characteristic of GN and CH, respectively. Documented further increases in PG did not worsen glomerular morphology, but kidney GFR did decrease. Hypertension induced deterioration of glomerular function in nephrons below the surface was not associated with marked morphologic deterioration, but a combination of the characteristics of GN and CH.\r"

Diabetic animals had elevated, glycated hemoglobin levels (P less than 0.05), increased creatinine clearance, and urinary albumin excretion rates (P less than 0.05) as compared to insulin treated diabetic (euglycemic), age-matched, and streptozotocin non-diabetic animals. The level of non-enzymatic glycation of glomerular basement membrane was significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) in the diabetic animals as well, with the level of non-enzymatic glycation of all animals, correlating (P less than 0.05) to the average blood glucose level of each animal. Despite changes in functional parameters, and increased levels of non-enzymatic glycation between the diabetic and euglycemic animals, there was no difference in glomerular basement membrane thickness between the two groups. However, there was a difference between all diabetic euglycemics and the age-matched control animals. We hypothesize that increased glycation of glomerular basement membrane may alter renal function, possibly by affecting the net charge of the glomerular filtration barrier. However, glomerular basement membrane thickening per se does not affect the functional changes which have been observed, thus casting doubt upon its role in the development of diabetic nephropathy.\r"

This 4% cholesterol/1% cholic acid-added diet was utilized because, in normal, non-nephrotic rats, this alimentary supplement produces, for the most part, only a significant rise in fasting serum cholesterol and not fasting serum triglycerides. FSGS developed 18 weeks after PA delivery, and both groups of rats were studied functionally and morphologically. Group 2 rats had significantly higher daily urine protein excretion, lower inulin clearance, and greater blood urea nitrogen concentrations than Group 1 animals. Histologically, Group 2 animals demonstrated a significantly greater percentage of glomeruli examined with segmental areas of glomerulosclerosis/hyalinosis, mesangial cell proliferation, and mesangial \"foam\" cells. At 2, 4, 12, and 18 weeks after PA delivery, the fasting serum cholesterol was always significantly greater in Group 2 rats, whereas in regards to fasting serum triglycerides it was only significantly elevated in Group 2 rats at 4 and 12 weeks after PA administration.\r"

Six weeks after the surgery, an i.p. inoculum of 10(6) colony forming units S. epidermidis was administered to renal failure mice and their sham-operated and normal controls, and assessment of bacterial clearance and inflammatory response was conducted over the next 72 hours. Peritoneal clearance of S. epidermidis was complete in most animals; however, the process was significantly delayed in renal failure mice compared to sham-operated controls. Viable bacteria invariably remained associated with the peritoneum after peritoneal washings had become culture negative. Peritoneal inflammatory response was markedly diminished in renal failure mice, the early polymorphonuclear cell response being particularly affected. Peripheral response consisted of a prompt and short-lived polymorph increase which was similar in renal failure and sham-operated mice. The factors responsible for the observed impairment of local inflammatory response in association with delayed bacterial clearance in renal failure mice following i.p. challenge with S. epidermidis remain to be defined.\r"

The additional contribution from cumulative water Al was negligible. In a subgroup of 26 patients with a urine output exceeding 10 ml/day, urinary Al excretion averaged 15.4 micrograms/day, and renal Al clearance and serum Al concentration were inversely related (r = -0.69, P less than 0.001). We conclude that Al-containing phosphate binders were a more important source of Al than was dialysate in these patients and that residual renal function can reduce the severity of hyperaluminemia in hemodialysis patients.\r"

Plasma noradrenaline levels were a significant inverse correlation to platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor density. In addition, mean arterial blood-pressure, plasma noradrenaline levels and platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor density were significantly related to the duration of treatment: with increasing duration of treatment plasma noradrenaline levels increased, whereas mean arterial blood-pressure and platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor density decreased. Furthermore, changes in mean arterial blood-pressure were inversely related to plasma noradrenaline levels and positively to platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor density. Platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor changes were accompanied by similar alterations in (vascular) alpha 1-adrenoceptor responsiveness (assessed by blood pressure responses to i.v. injections of phenylephrine); in hypotensive hemodialysis patients, who had high, plasma noradrenaline levels and low, platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor density, the dose of phenylephrine necessary to increase systolic blood pressure by 20 mm Hg was nearly twice as high as in normotensive dialysis patients and healthy controls. In autonomic tests, Valsalva-ratio was lower in hypotensive than in normotensive dialysis patients and healthy controls, whereas no differences were found in blood pressure and heart rate responses during sustained hand-grip exercise as well as in beat-to-beat variation during deep breathing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Yet the mechanisms for abnormal urinary protein leak in diabetes have not been defined. We studied 28 patients with type I diabetes for 7 to 33 years. Creatinine clearance, urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE), and multiple blood pressures were obtained in each patient. A renal biopsy was performed in each patient and in 28 normal subjects. Quantitative stereology was used to determine foot process (FP) width, filtration slit length density (FSLV) and filtration slit length/glomerulus (FSLG). FP width was slightly wider than normal in diabetic patients with UAE less than 250 mg/24 hr while FP was significantly wider than both of these groups in diabetics with UAE greater than 250 mg/24 hr. FSLV and FSLG were similar in normals and diabetics with UAE less than 250 mg/24 hr but both were reduced in diabetics with UAE greater than 250 mg/24 hr. UAE correlated with FP width (P less than 0.05), FSLG (P less than 0.01) and most precisely and FSLV (P less than 0.001). Diabetics with microalbuminuria had values for all the structural parameters measured here not different from diabetics with UAE in the normal range. Perturbations of epithelial cell structure are present in diabetes mellitus especially in patients with nephropathy. The exact relationships between albuminuria and epithelial cell structure remains to be elucidated.\r"

In spite of several morphometric studies the range of PP alterations in different proteinuric conditions has gone unnoticed. Thus, we studied the distribution of abnormally broadened PP in different glomerulopathies and in normal controls (children and adults). We found a highly variable mean PP-width in all proteinuric patients, values that were, however, always clearly distinct from normal controls in children and adults. A correlation between the extent of PP alteration and the amount of proteinuria was not found (r = 0.09) for the group as a whole or for the different clinico-pathological entities. In proteinuric patients 15 to 50% of all PP were broadened and covered 40 to 60% of the total length of the peripheral capillary loop. We conclude that the alteration of PP in various proteinuric conditions is variable and does not correlate with the level of proteinuria. These studies further suggest that other mechanisms, possible hemodynamic adaptation in response to the capillary wall injury, might play a role in the permeability changes observed in these patients.\r"

Of the 75 of our 1431 stone patients with struvite stones 52 were women. Struvite stones occurred almost exclusively in women; a minority of women and most men had mixed stones of struvite and calcium oxalate. Increased serum creatinine levels and reduced creatinine clearance were common in patients with struvite stones, not in those with mixed stones; both were rare in calcium stone disease. Men and women with mixed struvite, calcium oxalate stones were hypercalciuric, but women with struvite stones were not. Patients with mixed stones usually had initial symptoms of stone passage, and were less likely to need surgery, including nephrectomy, or to form contralateral stones. Patients with struvite stones usually presented with infection or no symptom, not passage. We conclude that struvite stones occur in two forms. The struvite stone is a disease of women, presumably occurring de novo from infection. The mixed stones occur in both sexes, presumably from secondary infection in hypercalciuric patients who begin with calcium-oxalate stone disease.\r"

  ".W": "Hypocalcemia in chronic renal failure (CRF) has been attributed in part to a skeletal resistance (S.R.) to the calcemic action of parathyroid hormone (PTH) as a consequence of low levels of 1,25(OH)2D3. To further elucidate the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the genesis of S.R., the calcemic effect of infusion of synthetic b-PTH 1-34 was examined in dogs before and after 7, 90 and 180 days of CRF. The maximum increment in ionized calcium after the infusion of PTH in the normal dogs was 1.15 +/- 0.13 mg/dl, decreased to 0.84 +/- 0.09 after 7 days, 0.68 +/- 0.1 after 90 days and to 0.66 +/- 0.11 mg/dl after 180 days of CRF. Thereafter, the dogs received 1,25(OH)2D3, 0.5 microgram daily for seven days and the studies were repeated. No improvement in the calcemic response to PTH was observed (0.57 +/- 0.26 mg/100 ml). Subsequently, a parathyroidectomy (PTX) was performed and 24 hours later the studies were repeated. After the infusion of PTH the calcemic response returned to normal (0.93 +/- 0.14 mg/dl). Further studies were performed in a group of four uremic dogs receiving no 1,25(OH)2D3, in which a PTX was performed 24 hours prior to the infusion of PTH. For this group, the increase in serum ionized calcium was 0.99 +/- 0.11 mg/dl. These values were not statistically different from normal dogs. In summary: (1) renal insufficiency was characterized by an abnormal calcemic response to PTH; (2) the administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 did not correct the S.R. to PTH; and (3) PTX performed 24 hours before the infusion of PTH restored the calcemic response to normal. These data suggest that high levels of endogenous parathyroid hormone desensitized the skeleton to the administration of exogenous PTH. These studies indicate that low values of 1,25(OH)2D3 are not directly responsible for the skeletal resistance to PTH in chronic renal failure.\r"

Plasma BCAA levels in CRF compared to pair-fed control rats were approximately 15% lower and muscle valine was 93 microM lower (P less than 0.05). BCAA metabolism was measured in incubated epitrochlearis muscles using L-[1-14C]valine or L-[1-14C]leucine in the presence and absence of insulin. BCAA decarboxylation was increased (P less than 0.05) and insulin-stimulated BCAA incorporation into protein was blunted (P less than 0.05) by CRF. Since we have found that metabolic acidosis, by itself, stimulates muscle branched-chain, ketoacid dehydrogenase activity, another group of CRF and control rats was given NaHCO3 which corrected the acidosis, but not the azotemia. BCAA decarboxylation in muscle was reduced in CRF rats given NaHCO3, and this was reflected in increased plasma and muscle BCAA concentrations. We conclude that in CRF, chronic metabolic acidosis stimulates BCAA decarboxylation in skeletal muscle and this could contribute to the reduced intra- and extracellular concentrations of BCAA. Correction of acidosis should be a goal of therapy in CRF, especially when dietary regimens restrict intake of BCAA.\r"

Glomerular filtration rate was significantly higher in trained (1.89 +/- 0.07 ml/min) than in sedentary rats (1.52 +/- 0.11 ml/min). No change was observed in renal blood flow or the degree of hypertension. Proteinuria was reduced in trained (13.6 +/- 4.9 mg/24 hr) compared to sedentary animals (33.5 +/- 9.2 mg/24 hr). The degree of glomerulosclerosis was much less prominent in trained animals. Plasma, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-levels and total triglycerides were reduced in trained compared to sedentary rats. This study suggests that chronic exercise training ameliorates the progression of renal disease and improves plasma lipids in rats with moderate renal insufficiency. The mechanism for this improvement in renal function appears to be independent of the influence of systemic blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the possibility of enhanced gastrointestinal absorption of aluminum in uremia, we measured the urinary aluminum excretion of rats following an oral load of 11 mg aluminum. Rats, in which uremia had been established by the remnant kidney model, excreted 1.5 to 2.2-fold higher amounts of aluminum in their urine over a collection period of five days compared with their controls. Within this period of time up to 0.17 +/- 0.08% of the oral dose of aluminum was recovered in the urine of the uremic animals. Serum concentrations of aluminum were significantly elevated five hours after ingestion of aluminum, but this increase was similar in rats with normal or reduced renal function. Uremic rats excreted significantly less aluminum during the first 24 hours after i.v. administration of 15 micrograms aluminum if the data were corrected for the higher baseline excretion rates. The excretion rate showed a negative correlation with the serum creatinine. Selective parathyroidectomy had no effect on the pattern or amount of urinary aluminum excretion after an oral load in either uremic rats or in rats with normal renal function. We conclude that the gastrointestinal absorption of aluminum is increased in uremic rats, and that parathyroid hormone has no detectable effect on the magnitude of aluminum absorption, regardless of the renal function in this model.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable evidence indicates that genetic determinants play a major role in the pathogenesis of a variety of human and experimentally-induced renal diseases. There are, however, no firm data to indicate which genes or types of genes can induce or promote renal disease. The recently acquired ability to make specific alterations in the genetic background of an animal affords a unique opportunity to assess the effect(s) of a given gene on the structure and function of an organ of interest. Such modifications have been carried out in the creation of transgenic mice. We examined mice transgenic for the transforming gene encoding large T-antigen which is present in the early region of simian virus 40 (SV40). Renal lesions were present in most animals. While there was some heterogeneity in the type and severity of the renal lesions observed, a majority of the older mice displayed glomerulosclerosis and/or proliferative tubular lesions which in some were associated with multiple, large tubular cysts. The appearance of these lesions in mice transgenic for a transforming gene suggests that renal expression of a gene which controls cell proliferation may be associated with the development of glomerulosclerosis and renal cysts. These findings indicate a possible role for other transforming genes, or oncogenes, in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis and cystic renal disease in humans and other animal models.\r"

  ".W": "Complement activation associated with immune complex glomerular deposition plays an important role in renal injury. In the present studies we performed three series of experiments to identify how IgA immune complexes activate complement. The first series of experiments was designed to determine whether the presence of an antigen within a glomerular IgA immune deposit is required for complement activation. In these experiments, large-sized covalently cross-linked IgA oligomers (X-IgA) were prepared with purified IgA anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) and a bivalent affinity-labeling antigen, bis-2,4-DNP-pimelic acid ester. These X-IgA oligomers have free antigen-binding sites that will bind DNP-conjugated antigens. Two groups of mice were treated with either X-IgA or X-IgA followed, after two hours, by an antigen DNP-Ficoll. Immunofluorescent examination of renal tissues, obtained six hours after the initial injection, revealed an equal intensity of IgA glomerular deposits in both groups of mice. Glomerular C3 deposits were only detectable in the renal tissues of mice that had DNP-Ficoll bound to X-IgA. In the second series of experiments, a pair of preformed IgA immune complexes, differing only in one antigenic structural feature (DNP), were used to examine the role of the antigen in inducing glomerular C3 deposits in two groups of mice. These pre-formed immune complexes were prepared with IgA anti-phosphorylcholine (PC) and either PC-conjugated to bovine serum albumin (PC-BSA) or PC-BSA which was further modified with DNP (PC/DNP-BSA). Although the IgA immunofluorescent intensity and pattern in the glomerular deposits were equivalent for both groups, intense C3 deposits were exclusively associated with the PC/DNP-BSA-containing immune complexes. Analysis of the relative conversion of normal human serum C3 to inactive C3b (iC3b) by X-IgA, various antigens and their respective IgA immune complexes was highly dependent on the nature of the antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Microscopic localization of these receptors revealed binding over medullary and cortical thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and in distal convoluted tubule. A number of receptor positive cells in the inner medulla were also identified. Characterization of the binding demonstrated a single class of high-affinity binding sites in both the medulla and the cortex with affinity constants of 0.74 +/- 0.09 x 10(9) M-1 and 0.32 +/- 0.05 x 10(9) M-1, respectively, and receptor concentrations of 205 +/- 45 fmol/mg protein and 453 +/- 54 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Competition for 125I-salmon calcitonin binding by a wide range of calcitonin analogs revealed a close correspondence between the reported biological potencies and activities in the current system. The localization of binding sites within the nephron corresponds to the reported localization of calcitonin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and suggests that the receptor mediated actions of calcitonin in the kidney utilize cyclic AMP as a second messenger. In addition, the microscopic identification of specific calcitonin receptors helps the delineation of direct actions of this hormone from those which are indirect.\r"

Each subject was studied at three levels of blood glucose (mmol/liter) concentration, mean (SE): Level 1, fasting, 4.5 (0.1); Level 2, hyperglycemia below renal threshold for glucose, 7.2 (0.1); Level 3, hyperglycemia with glycosuria, 12.6 (0.5). There was a significant rise in mean Cin (ml/min/1.73 m2) when changing from Level 1 (112[3]) to Level 2 (121[5]), with no further increase on changing to Level 3 (122[4]). With glycosuria Cin fell in some subjects. Mean CPAH (ml/min/1.73 m2) increased through Level 1 (560[27]) to Level 3 (603[34]), with consequently no change in mean filtration fraction at the three levels of glycemia. Our observations show a rise in glomerular filtration rate with mild hyperglycemia below renal threshold, with no further increase during hyperglycemia sufficient to produce glycosuria.\r"

On the basis of bone histology, hemodialysis patients were classified into two groups: (1) patients with normal bone resorption; and (2) patients with active secondary hyperparathyroidism characterized by an increased bone resorption. Left ventricular function of these two subgroups were compared together as well as with the echocardiographic characteristics of normal controls. In comparison with normal controls, hemodialysis patients with normal bone resorption had an increased left ventricular volume (P less than 0.001) and left ventricular mass (P less than 0.001) with a similar left ventricular mass-to-volume ratio. Their systolic arterial pressure--mass-to-volume ratio correlation was similar to that of normal controls, indicating an adequate myocardial hypertrophy. Patients with increased bone resorption had high parathormone and alkaline phosphatase levels; though the left ventricular dilation was similar to that of hemodialysis patients with normal bone resorption, the left ventricular mass was lower (P less than 0.001) and was similar to the left ventricular mass of normal controls. In addition, patients with increased bone resorption had a lower mass-to-volume ratio (P less than 0.001) and their systolic arterial pressure--mass-to-volume ratio correlation exhibited a significant downward shift (P less than 0.001), suggesting an inadequate myocardial hypertrophy. Patients with increased bone resorption and secondary hyperparathyroidism had an increased heart rate, a higher systolic arterial pressure and end-systolic stress. Furthermore, they had an increased velocity of fiber shortening (P less than 0.01) and shorter left ventricular ejection time (P less than 0.001). In summary, present data suggest the possibility that parathormone may exert myocardial effects in hemodialysis patients.\r"

In comparison with the control procedure (blood temperature within the dialyzer 35 degrees C) hypothermic dialysis reduced peak C5a generation from 41.7 +/- 17 ng/ml to 9.7 +/- 3.4 ng/ml (P less than 0.01), and white blood cell fall from 72 +/- 15 to 25 +/- 20% (P less than 0.01). Arterial PO2 decreased less in hypothermic dialysis (-19 +/- 9% of pre-HD value) than in the control procedure (-30 +/- 11%) (P less than 0.05).

Of the 155 sites that were treated, various degrees of edema, erythema, and necrosis, sometimes accompanied by blistering, were evident in all areas within 24 to 48 hours of light treatment. While our follow-up periods are short, four patients are free of disease at eight months or more posttreatment, two patients have had recurrent and/or persistent disease within four months, and four patients died within nine months from metastatic disease or unrelated disorders. Continued investigation into the use of photodynamic therapy for treatment of malignant lesions appears warranted, based on these preliminary clinical results.\r"

  ".W": "Since the first use of lasers in ophthalmology in the early 1960s, applications for the medical laser have been found in many medical specialties. Despite their increasing usefulness, lasers have been reported to induce injuries. Few studies have tried to quantify the number of injuries caused by the clinical use of lasers. To address this issue, we surveyed physicians at the 5th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery, May 1985. Forty-two of the 226 physicians attending the meeting responded to the questionnaire about their experience with lasers in their practice. An average of 25 laser procedures per month were performed by the responding physicians, and 61.9% of them reported at least one complication. Of the complications reported in the survey, 33 occurred within the last 12 months for an overall rate of 2.7 incidents per 1,000 procedures performed. The most common complications reported were burns and scarring; however, bowel perforation and pneumothorax were among the more serious. The mean number of reported complications varied by the length and type of training in the use of the laser, with the lowest number of complications reported by respondents who had taken a training course lasting longer than 7 days within the last year. Our findings show that both minor and life-threatening injury can be caused by the clinical use of medical lasers. Evaluation of the adverse effects of any medical technology, such as lasers, is needed to help guide recommendations for its safe use.\r"

However, the heterogeneous composition of calculi and difficulties in producing optically thin samples prevent conventional spectrophotometric measurement techniques from being used. To overcome these limitations, we used a pulsed photothermal radiometry system to measure the optical absorption coefficients and thermal diffusivities of various biliary calculi. In the wavelength range examined (350-1,060 nm), there was strong optical absorption which was greater for pigment stones than for cholesterol stones. The data support the theory that the initiation of the plasma accompanying laser fragmentation of calculi is a thermal process.\r"

Energy delivered per treatment ranged from 3,152 to 70,527 joules. Total energy delivered per patient depended on the volume of tumor destroyed. Esophageal lumens increased from 3.4 to 16.7 mm, and 23 patients had their diets advanced, 22 to regular and one to soft solids. Reobstruction did not occur in patients who received adjunctive therapy after laser therapy. This consisted of chemotherapy in five, surgery in two, and radiation therapy in one. Complications consisted of aspiration pneumonia in three patients, including one who developed a tracheoesophageal fistula, and one documented and two suspected perforations. Hospital stay averaged 5.4 days overall and 3.5 days in those treated with the single-session technique. This increased to 8.0 days in patients with proven or suspected perforations. Endoscopic laser therapy is a safe and effective method for palliating esophageal cancer.\r"

A recent study claims that cutting the intestine with the CO2 laser improves the healing of intestinal anastomoses (Ferulano et al: Eur Surg Res 16:127-130, 1984). The present study was undertaken to analyze the effects of electrocautery, CO2 laser, and contact Nd:YAG laser on the healing of intestinal incisions. Fifteen piglets were used and the cutting and reanastomosing were performed by using all cutting methods in each animal in randomized order. Resection sites were 50 cm, 100 cm, and 150 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. On the seventh day the bursting pressures were measured for each anastomosis. They were 172 +/- 17 mmHg for normal bowel segment and 133 +/- 12, 135 +/- 40, and 139 +/- 17 mmHg for electrocautery, CO2 laser, and Nd:YAG laser, respectively. There were no mortality, no anastomotic leaks, and no statistically significant differences in the bursting pressures, in histology, or in the healing of anastomotic sites, indicating that electrocautery, CO2 laser, and contact Nd:YAG laser scalpel can safely be used in the surgery of small intestine.\r"

Data are collected under different operating conditions, such as laser power, scanning speed, and lens focusing for fresh and fixed human bones from male and female femora and tibiae samples with ages varying between 28 and 73 years old. The aim of the present experiments was to demonstrate the feasibility of laser osteotomy, to find the energy requirements for given groove depths or bone removal rates, and to shed some light on optimum conditions for laser osteotomy. Only cadaveric bones were used in this study, since the present aim did not include the investigation of heating rates and the extent and effect of thermal necrosis adjacent to the cut. In vivo properties may be somewhat different from those of cadaveric material. While blood circulation within the living bone may contribute to the laser cutting characteristics, it cannot be addressed here. Experiments showed that very deep cuts are difficult to achieve with a CO2 laser, as at high-power/low-scan-speed the groove becomes rather wide, with unacceptable thermal damage adjacent to the cut, while multiple passes do not easily attain large depths. There was no significant difference for the laser heat-of-removal for different age groups and for male and female samples. The laser heat-of-removal was found to be higher for compact bone than for cancellous bone samples. Comparison of cross-sections of the cuts with an existing model gave good agreement.\r"

Using 15-20 watts of laser energy, the tumor blanched and underwent necrosis. The technique was easy to apply, and bleeding was minimal. Damage to the ureteral orifice and ureter in the bladder wall at repeat cystoscopy appeared less than with conventional electrocautery or noncontact laser treatment. The technique of contact Nd:YAG laser surgery will have an important role in the transurethral treatment of bladder tumors.\r"

This characteristic fluorescence can be taken as a criterion for cancer diagnosis; a consistency of 89% with the traditional biopsy method has been obtained in preliminary clinical application to the diagnosis of buccal carcinoma. Spectroscopic investigations suggest that the porphyrin compounds localized and retained in cancer tissues might be responsible for this characteristic autofluorescence.\r"

  ".W": "Aging is associated with increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, lower maximal O2 uptake, and lower energy intake. It has been asserted that these changes are caused in part by decreased activity. In order to determine the effects of aging in men who are habitually active, 6 young men (26.8 +/- 1.2 yr) and 6 middle-aged men (52.0 +/- 1.9 yr) who had been running, cycling, and/or rowing for at least 2 yr were studied in a metabolic ward. The men consumed a diet to maintain constant body weight while keeping to their usual exercise schedule and intensity. Both groups had a similar body mass index and muscle mass, but the middle-aged men had a 77% greater fat mass (P = 0.028). Daily energy requirement was 17% lower in the middle-aged men (P = 0.029) although basal metabolic rate was similar in both groups. Aerobic capacity was 15% lower in the middle-aged men per unit body weight (P = 0.048) but not per unit of lean body mass. The young men exercised for an average 12.3 hr.wk-1 and the middle-aged men for 7.5 hr.wk-1 (P = 0.018). For both young and middle-aged men, weekly hours of exercise were negatively correlated with fat mass, and positively correlated with daily energy requirements and maximal O2 uptake. These findings show that in both young and middle-aged men who habitually exercise aerobically at 65 to 80% maximal O2 uptake, the time spent training was associated with body composition, energy requirements, and aerobic capacity.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships of three commonly used indicators of physical activity to determine how they relate to each other as well as to measures of physical fitness and anthropometric measurements related to body fatness. Data from white adult men working for U.S. railroad companies in 1957 to 1960, who were free of pre-existing cardiovascular disease (N = 2,356), were used to study these relationships cross-sectionally. Total and intense leisure time activity and occupational activity were directly related to caloric intake. Total leisure time activity was inversely related to exercise test heart rate and directly related to body mass index, but not related to resting heart rate or skinfold thickness. Intense leisure time activity was significantly related to all fitness measures and not significantly related to fatness. Caloric intake was directly related to measures of fitness and inversely related to fatness. Occupational activity was directly related to measures of fitness and body mass index, and inversely related to skinfold thickness. These results provide a better understanding of methods appropriate to ascertaining physical activity in epidemiologic research as well as assisting in the comparison of results from studies which have used different physical activity indicators.\r"

Volume-matched infusions containing either a placebo, 2 mg naloxone, or 10 mg naloxone were administered (in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over fashion) to nine physically active male volunteers (age 23.4 +/- 1.1 yr). Subjects performed 30 min of cycling at a fixed work rate (average 133 W or 54% of maximal oxygen uptake) chosen to elicit approximately 70% of the pre-determined maximal heart rate. Heart rate, blood pressure, ventilatory responses, and perceived exertion were unaffected by naloxone during exercise. Likewise, the rise in rectal temperature that occurred during exercise was essentially equivalent for placebo (0.69 +/- 0.04 degrees C increase from 0 to 30 min, P less than 0.001), 2 mg naloxone (0.60 +/- 0.04 degrees C increase from 0 to 30 min, P less than 0.001), and 10 mg naloxone (0.60 +/- 0.04 degrees C increase from 0 to 30 min, P less than 0.001). In agreement with the rectal temperature observations, naloxone did not modify sweating during exercise. Thus, insofar as naloxone may be used as an inferential tool to examine the physiologic significance of the endogenous opioid system, these data suggest that endogenous opioids are unlikely to play a significant role in the maintenance of thermal homeostasis during 30 min of sub-maximal exercise.\r"

Exercise consisted of 90 min of cycling at 65 to 70% VO2max. Following exercise, blood glucose was found to be significantly (P less than 0.05) higher for CFG and GLU (117 and 109 mg%) compared to CON, CAF, and FRU (92, 89, and 86 mg%). Blood free fatty acids rose (P less than 0.05) further for CON (1,336), CAF (1,126), and FRU (1,034) over CFG (737) and GLU (714 mumol.l-1). Muscle glycogen utilization was greater (P less than 0.05) for CON (91) vs CAF (63) and GLU (62 mumol/g-1 wet muscle weight). It was concluded that GLU and CAF decrease muscle glycogen utilization, FRU is likely to cause gastric upset, and ingestion of multiple substances produces the greatest variability in muscle glycogen utilization and may provide added endurance benefits in some individuals.\r"

Twelve control subjects did not train. DMS was reduced, although not totally prevented, by the 1 wk, and especially, 2 wk of downhill running training. Training by uphill running had little effect in preventing DMS. Mean SCK values 24 h after the experimental run were not significantly different among the groups (range: 99 to 340% of pre-exercise values), indicating no effect of any training regimen. Relatively large differences existed among subjects in terms of soreness and SCK responses to the experimental running. It was suggested that DMS may be difficult to totally avoid if exercise with a large eccentric component is performed. Prevention of such DMS may be most likely if prior training involves exercise with a substantial eccentric component, starts with bouts of very small quantities, and progresses in small increments over more than 2 wk.\r"

Exercise was performed at a set work rate (120 W) on a cycle ergometer before and 2 h after the ingestion of 80 mg propranolol. The heart rate on completion of exercise was reduced (P less than 0.001) from 140 +/- 5 to 108 +/- 3 beats.min-1 by propranolol demonstrating a considerable degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. At rest, neither Tre nor Tpa were modified by propranolol. Likewise, propranolol failed to modify the Tre response to exercise. However, propranolol induced an alteration of the normal relationship between Tre and Tpa during exercise. In particular, although Tre was essentially unchanged, propranolol accentuated both the initial fall (by 0.28 degrees C, P less than 0.001) and the subsequent rise (by 0.46 degrees C, P less than 0.01) in Tpa during exercise. The present data therefore demonstrate a considerable limitation to the use of Tre when assessing thermal homeostasis during acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Furthermore, although research with more chronic therapy is warranted, our study suggests an accentuated risk of hyperthermia and, by implication, its adverse physiologic consequences during prolonged exercise performed by coronary artery disease patients treated with propranolol.\r"

Thirteen male subjects (24 to 35 yr) completed four separate rides. Each ride consisted of intermittent steady-state cycling (at 55 and 65% VO2max) interspersed with five rest periods. A timed 480 revolution cycling task completed each experimental session. During each rest period, subjects consumed 2 ml.kg-1 body weight of water placebo or solutions of 5% glucose polymer, 6% sucrose/glucose, or 7% glucose polymer/fructose. Beverages were administered in double-blind, counter-balanced order. No differences were observed among subjects in response to beverage treatments for changes in plasma concentrations of total proteins, sodium, potassium, lactate, or in osmolality, percent change in plasma volume, heart rate, oxygen uptake, respiratory exchange ratio, rating of perceived exertion, sweat rate, rectal temperature, or mean skin temperature. Compared to water placebo, the carbohydrate treatments produced higher plasma glucose values following 1 h cycling (P less than 0.01). Mean (SD) times for the 480 revolution cycling task: water placebo = 432 (43) s; glucose polymer = 401 (52) s; *sucrose/glucose = 384 (39) s; and *glucose polymer/fructose = 375 (30) s, where  = P less than 0.001 compared to water placebo.

The index was based on the linear reduction of fractional utilization of VO2max with total running time greater than 7 min plotted on a log scale. The endurance index estimated from VO2max, running efficiency and the marathon performance of 18 male runners (30 +/- 7 yr old; VO2max = 66 +/- 5 ml.kg-1.min-1) ranged between -4.07 and -9.96% VO2max.1 nt-1 (mean +/- SD = -6.40 +/- 1.50) and was not related to VO2max (r = 0.107) or speed in the marathon race (r = 0.354). However, the endurance index was closely related (r = 0.853) to the fractional utilization of VO2max at ventilatory threshold (breakaway of the excess CO2 elimination curve) which occurred at 76.1 +/- 5.5% VO2max in response to a graded treadmill test. These results indicate that: (i) running time on long distance races is not, per se, an adequate measure of endurance capability because of the major contribution of VO2max to long distance running performance; (ii) the endurance index expressed as %VO2max.1n t-1 is an objective and independent index of endurance capability; and (iii) runners with a high endurance capability tend to hyperventilate at higher relative workload during a graded treadmill test.\r"

Eight subjects participated in the study. Bipolar surface electrodes detected electromyographic signals (digitized at 1,000 Hz) from each of the three heads of the triceps brachii muscle. The task used was elbow extension with the forearm attached to, and supported by, a dynamometer. Each subject performed 100 trials (analyzed in groups of 10 trials) at approximately 70% the previously established maximum peak acceleration. Analysis consisted of calculating the EMD of each head of the triceps, \"true\" EMD (time from the first head's activation to movement) activation lag time (difference between the first and last activated heads EMD), and activation order. Correlations between EMD and peak acceleration for the three heads were found to be low, consistent with previous research, and the relationship was not improved by use of the true EMD. Activation lag times were found to decrease (non-significantly) over the 100 trials. Activation order was found to vary widely between subjects but as a group favored the medial head. Results of this study appear to support the contention that the \"product\" nature of EMD measure is of less merit than generally considered and that a more \"process\"-related parameter would provide better information regarding peripheral processes.\r"

However, the experimental evidence also indicates that during movement there is active control of the trajectory in addition to control of final position.

In most patients who have had a modified radical mastectomy, the breast can be easily reconstructed with a subpectoral Silastic implant. In those who have had more extensive resections of tissue or radiation damage of the skin, reconstruction can still be reliably carried out by using either a latissimus dorsi flap in addition to the implant or by using the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap reconstruction. In many patients who reject these more complicated options, breast reconstruction can still be carried out with tissue expanders and subsequent placement of a subpectoral Silastic implant. For patients who desire prophylactic removal of breast cancer with extensive fibrocystic disease or precancerous histologic changes, subcutaneous mastectomy with immediate reconstruction offers maximum removal of breast tissue with minimal distortion of body image.\r"

Using isolated white Wistar rat lenses, rat lenses in vivo, and isolated human lenses, we attempted both to replace lens protein as well as develop techniques for microsurgically closing the capsule by applying a fibrinogen-based tissue adhesive. This application was effective in preventing traumatic cataract. Use of a fibrinogen-glued capsule graft yielded similarly good (but not better) results.\r"

In eyes with narrow angles and acute glaucoma, ciliary block must be differentiated from pupillary block to provide appropriate therapy. We review two cases of ciliary block glaucoma following uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implantation. Previous filtering procedures in these cases resulted in protracted shallowing of the anterior chamber, possibly contributing to the pathogenesis of ciliary block. In addition, the operative trauma of cataract surgery may have resulted in the separation of the vitreous base from the pars plana. Misdirected aqueous humor then could have entered the vitreous body, displacing the iris-pseudophakos diaphragm forward, and resulting in the acute glaucoma. Vitrectomy, which resolved the acute glaucoma, is valuable in treating ciliary block glaucoma.\r"

While all parts of one implant in the bag were found to be free of reactive elements on their surface, the other whole implant and the one haptic outside of the bag were covered by a well-developed reactive membrane composed of a proteinaceous film with sessile macrophages and a few giant cells.

All 38 patients were measured preoperatively and the mean (+/- SD) pupillary defect was 1.4 +/- 0.7 log units. The afferent pupillary defect decreased in 36 of the 38 patients after successful scleral buckling operations (postoperative mean = 0.4 +/- 0.3 log units). Twenty patients had defects postoperatively of 0.3 log units or less, and seven of these had no measurable defects at all. A prediction model, using the variables of total number of peripheral quadrants detached and whether the macula was detached, yielded the following prediction equation: Relative afferent pupillary defect (log units) = 0.35 X (total quadrants) + 0.68 X macula detachment. This means that the detachment of each peripheral quadrant of retina caused about 0.35 log units of defect, whereas detachment of the macula caused 0.68 log units. The standard error of this estimate was rather large (+/- .65 log units); therefore, the size of the afferent pupillary defect can only roughly predict the extent of the retinal detachment and vice versa.\r"

To overcome this shortcoming, I have developed a new system which utilizes a cotton thread enclosed in a soft, calibrated, silicone tubing. In subsequent testing of this new technique, eyes that exhibited a strong epiphora state gave a wetted length of 226.9 +/- 56.0 mm (mean +/- SD) in a 5- to 10-second test.

In 11 eyes (11 patients) manifest glaucoma was present (excavated optic disk, visual field defect). All examined subjects had normal visual acuity and clear optic media. The amplitude of the positive component of the PERG was measured. The mean PERG amplitude was 2.8 +/- 1.2 microV in the eyes with normal IOP (19 +/- 3 mm Hg), 2.2 +/- 1.0 microV in the eyes with moderately elevated IOP (26 +/- 2 mm Hg), 2.0 +/- 0.9 microV in the eyes with IOP above 30 mm Hg (33 +/- 4 mm Hg) and 1.1 +/- 0.6 microV in the glaucomatous eyes. Regression lines of PERG amplitudes versus age were calculated in all groups and showed a decrease in amplitude with increasing age. However, the correlation coefficients were not statistically significant. The decline with age was similar in all groups.

The probability of success at 4 years (decrease in IOP greater than or equal to 3 mmHg, IOP less than or equal to 19 mmHg, stable visual field, stable optic nerve, and no further laser or surgical intervention) was 52%. Pretreatment IOP, diagnosis, previous operations, age, and sex were not significant determinants for success or failure. Eyes receiving argon laser trabeculoplasty before cataract surgery maintained control of IOP after surgery. Failure was most common in the first year after treatment (23%), and thereafter failure occurred at a rate of 7 to 10% per year.\r"

A bioerodible polyanhydride composed of bis (p-carboxyphenoxy) hexane (PCPH) and sebacic acid (SA) was used as the drug carrier. The polymer and 5-FU (10% by weight) were molded into 4-mm long cylinders by a 15-gauge needle. These implants, with and without the therapeutic agent, were placed at the site of filtration surgery intraoperatively. The results showed that intraocular pressures (IOPs) were lower in the experimental eyes during the second postoperative week, but eventually both experimental and control eyes returned to preoperative levels. Filtration blebs lasted longer in experimental eyes and bleb failure occurred before IOP failure in both experimental and control eyes. Implant disappearance occurred after IOP and bleb failure. Experimental eyes had more postoperative complications than control eyes. Eventually, the filtration surgery failed in both the experimental and control rabbit eyes.\r"

Patients were randomized into four groups and all applanations were done by the same investigator. The Tono-Pen initially used (Tono-Pen #1) failed to calibrate after being used on 77 eyes. Tono-Pen #2 was then obtained and tested. Each Tono-Pen showed high correlation with the Goldmann readings (r greater than or equal to 0.86 in both eyes). The overall sensitivity of the Tono-Pen in detecting IOPs of 21 mmHg or higher (as measured by the Goldmann instrument) was 62.1% in right eyes, 72.4% in left eyes, with corresponding specificities of 92.6% in the right and 97.1% in the left. Given the substantial increase in sensitivity noted with Tono-Pen #2, the Tono-Pen appears adequate for screening programs where an IOP of 21 mmHg or above is considered abnormal; however, at higher IOPs (greater than or equal to 30 mmHg) the Tono-Pens tended to underestimate Goldmann IOPs. At low IOPs (less than or equal to 9 mmHg) the Tono-Pens tended to overestimate the IOPs. Perhaps with further modifications of the instrument, it could be used for clinical diagnosis and management of glaucoma patients.\r"

In young adults, CRVO is a rare occurrence, the cause of which is not well understood. Seven patients under the age of 36 years with CRVO and no associated systemic disease underwent modified diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements (8:00 AM to 11:00 PM). Abnormal IOPs were found in the affected and/or the unaffected fellow eyes. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report implicating abnormal IOP as an etiologic factor in the development of CRVO in young adults. Only with diurnal IOP measurements were the elevated swings and peak IOPs detected. This finding suggests that abnormal IOP may be an important factor in the development of CRVO in young adults.\r"

Four patients used distilled water and salt tablet saline, three used tap water and salt tablet saline, two used tap water rinse, two used well water rinse or storage, and one used intravenous (IV) saline. It is apparent that all contact lens wearers are at some risk for Acanthamoeba keratitis developing if proper contact lens care is not maintained. Of great concern is the inability of most current chemical sterilization methods to kill the organism if the lens becomes contaminated. Heat disinfection will kill Acanthamoeba trophozoites and cysts but the lens must not be placed into contaminated solutions afterward. Prevention is very important because medical and surgical treatment failures are frequent. Eye care practitioners who fit contact lenses are advised to use heat disinfection for low-water content stock soft contact lenses, and to use hydrogen peroxide without a catalyst for a minimum of 6 hours for all other stock lens fitting sets, to specifically inquire about contact lens care habits used by their patients, and to discourage the use of homemade saline solutions.\r"

The presence of depression did not influence the concentrations of neurotransmitters. No correlation was found between the concentrations of monoamine metabolites and beta-endorphin. However, there was a positive correlation between 5-HIAA and HVA in controls and chronic pain patients without depression but not in depressed patients. It is concluded: chronic pain states are associated with elevation of CSF 5-HIAA in female patients; depression abolishes a positive correlation between 5-HIAA and HVA.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of amitriptyline was evaluated in 28 patients with chronic oral-facial pain. Most of the patients had evidence of musculoskeletal pain while some had a history suggesting pain of neurogenic origin. Two patients had mixed elements of neurogenic and musculoskeletal pain. Amitriptyline was more effective than placebo in reducing pain after 4 weeks of treatment. No effect was found after only 1 week of drug administration in either dose range. When the patients were divided into depressed and non-depressed groups based on their Hamilton depression scores, amitriptyline reduced pain in the depressed and in the non-depressed groups as compared to placebo. Amitriptyline reduced the depression scores in the depressed group but had no effect on the depression scores in the non-depressed group. Thus, pain reduction was not associated with a change in mood in the non-depressed group. Amitriptyline had no effect on patients' ratings of the intensity of experimental heat stimuli. We conclude that amitriptyline is effective in the treatment of chronic oral-facial pain and that its efficacy is independent of its effects on depression. It appears that tricyclic antidepressants act in a fashion different from opiate drugs that alter the sensory discriminative component of pain.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective, multi-physician survey was carried out to examine the infusion concentrations of morphine delivered intrathecally by continuous infusion pumps placed to control pain. Replies from 19 physicians formed the basis for a population of 163 patients who received morphine by continuous infusion delivered by an Infusaid pump through a chronically implanted intrathecal catheter (N = 130 for pain of a metastatic origin; N = 3 for non-metastatic pain; N = 30 undefined). These patients received a total of 3443 patient weeks of infusion. The median infusion duration was 13 weeks (+/- 1 quartile: 5-24 weeks). Examination of the concentrations employed revealed that the maximally employed concentration was 1 mg/ml (885 patient weeks). Of the 163 patients, 151 patients received no concentration of morphine sulfate higher than 10 mg/ml. The highest reported concentrations used were around 35 mg/ml. No pathological sequelae related to the infusion of any dose of the opiates were reported. Cumulating the experience with morphine solutions of 8.9 and 10 mg/ml reveals a total of 472 patient weeks in 29 patients. Analysis of the change in infusion dose over time in cancer pain patients revealed a prominent time-dependent increase (N = 130) from 4.8 +/- 0.4 mg/day (N = 130) to 21 +/- 9 mg/day at 52 weeks (N = 10; mean +/- S.E.M.). Though the group morphine utilization rose, examination of the patient population which was infused for periods in excess of 3 months indicated that 48% showed less than a 2-fold increase in dose by 3 months.\r"

The decreased pain in the formalin test was not due to the diffusion of lidocaine into areas surrounding the LH or other possible artifacts.

  ".W": "Tooth pulp-driven (TPD) neurons are found in the oral area of the first somatosensory cortex (SI) of the cat. They have been classified according to their discharge patterns in response to electrical stimulation of the tooth pulp: the fast (F) type, slow (S) type, and a fast (Fa) type accompanied by afterdischarges. The characteristics of each type of TPD neuron were investigated in cats anesthetized with nitrous oxide and halothane. In surface distribution, there was no biased localization for any of the types. However, F-type neurons receiving input from the mandibular tooth tended to be found more medially than F-types receiving maxillary input. These TPD neurons did not change their firing pattern even when the stimulus was intensified. Mean threshold of the F-type to tooth pulp stimulation was 7.8 +/- 1.6 V and tended to be lower than that of the S-type (16.3 +/- 3.0 V). Graded increases in tooth pulp stimulation produced progressive increases in discharge frequency of both types of neurons. An analysis of the power function in relation to stimulus vs. response demonstrated that the exponent of the S-type neuron was about 2.0, being significantly larger compared to the 0.8 value for the F-type. The mean number of pulps afferent to an F-type was 1.6, compared to 4.8 for an S-type or 4.3 for an Fa-type. The results suggest that F-type TPD neurons may play a more important part in localizing pulpal pain and in recognizing the intensity than the other types.\r"

When injected intrathecally, they produced dramatically different behavioural effects. Septide, the selective SP-P receptor agonist, evoked intense, compulsive scratching, biting and licking of the hind limb, with no sign of motor flaccidity, and without measurable effect on responses to noxious thermal or mechanical stimulation of the foot or tail. In contrast, senktide, the selective SP-N receptor agonist, produced profound, but transient, motor flaccidity, reduced response to noxious stimuli and, at low doses, 'wet-dog shakes.' These various symptoms, all previously associated with SP and/or synthetic SP analogues, appear therefore to derive from activation of distinct SP receptor subtypes.\r"

We developed the method in an initial series of 157 children with acute diarrhea; the reproducibility of the method was tested in a second series of 180 cases. Eighty-six percent of patients in the first series and 81% in the second were correctly classified by our method. We suggest its use, especially in pediatric practice, to identify children with the highest probability of bacterial diarrhea, thus reserving stool culture to a few selected cases because only a minority of children with diarrhea have a recognized bacterial etiology.\r"

  ".W": "A nationwide vaccination campaign with oral poliovirus vaccine was organized in Finland in 1985 to halt an outbreak of poliomyelitis. Immunocompromised persons and their household contacts were excluded from the oral poliovirus vaccine target group and given instead a dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine. This gave us an opportunity to determine whether immunocompromised persons are protected from poliomyelitis during an outbreak and oral poliovirus campaign. Fourteen children, ages 3 to 17 years, with leukemia were given a booster dose of a novel high antigen content, trivalent inactivated poliovirus vaccine. All but two responded by an at least 4-fold increase in serum-neutralizing antibodies to at least one poliovirus serotype. These results indicate that children with acute lymphocytic leukemia in remission respond well to a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine. Antibody concentrations to the uncommon local epidemic strain of type 3 poliovirus remained, however, relatively low in most patients (median, 1:6) suggesting relatively impaired heterologous response to vaccination. Possible spread of live vaccine viruses to the inactivated poliovirus-vaccinated children and their close contacts was evaluated by examining weekly fecal specimens from 20 children and their 19 regular adult contacts for cytopathic viruses. No polioviruses were isolated from 224 specimens examined, indicating that this high risk population was well-protected from unintended exposure to live polioviruses.\r"

Measured hourly values were combined to represent four-hour and eight-hour \"spot\" collections and then extrapolated to represent 24-hour losses. A great variation in sodium excretion was demonstrated on hourly samples; the variations were compounded by extrapolation. The extrapolated values varied from the measured hourly sodium losses by 0.66 to 123%. The four-hour extrapolations varied from measured values 14 to 198% (mean 55.2%). The eight-hour combinations varied 6.59 to 136% (mean 44.1%). On the basis of these data, we discourage the use of extrapolated values to imply 24-hour requirements.

Patients arresting outside the hospital who received early basic CPR at the scene were significantly more likely to be resuscitated, at least temporarily, than those who did not (8/8 vs 5/11; P = 0.02). A statistically significant difference in outcome was also demonstrated between patients with an initial arterial blood pH greater than 7.0 and those with an initial arterial blood pH less than 7.0 (P less than 0.05). We conclude that an initial arterial blood pH less than 7.0 predicts a poor outcome from cardiopulmonary arrest in children.

The response to doubling concentrations of up to 8 g/l of histamine was assessed by the change in the maximum flow at FRC (VmaxFRC), measured by flow-volume curves produced during forced expiration with a pressure jacket. The concentration of histamine required to provoke a 30% fall in VmaxFRC (PC30) was measured. All of the infants responded to low concentrations of histamine during control tests before and after nebulised saline (mean PC30 1.07 and 0.51 g/l). On a separate day there was a similar response to histamine before salbutamol (PC30 0.57 g/l), but after salbutamol the response was completely abolished up to the maximum concentration of histamine in all subjects (PC30 greater than 8 g/l). Thus wheezy infants have highly effective beta 2 adrenoceptors in intrathoracic airways.\r"

  ".W": "Parents of children with cystic fibrosis have been reported to have a high prevalence of increased airway reactivity, but these studies were done in a select young, healthy, symptomless population. In the present study respiratory symptoms were examined in 315 unselected parents of children with cystic fibrosis and 162 parents of children with congenital heart disease (controls). The cardinal symptom of airway reactivity, wheezing, was somewhat more prevalent in cystic fibrosis parents than in controls, but for most subgroups this increased prevalence did not reach statistical significance. Among those who had never smoked, 38% of obligate heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis but only 25% of the controls reported wheezing (p less than 0.05). The cystic fibrosis parents who had never smoked but reported wheezing had lower FEV1 and FEF25-75, expressed as a percentage of the predicted value, than control parents; and an appreciable portion of the variance in pulmonary function was contributed by the interaction of heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis with wheezing. For cystic fibrosis parents, but not controls, the complaint of wheezing significantly contributed to the prediction of pulmonary function (FEV1 and FEF25-75). In addition, parents of children with cystic fibrosis reported having lung disease before the age of 16 more than twice as frequently as control parents. Other respiratory complaints, including dyspnoea, cough, bronchitis, and hay fever, were as common in controls as in cystic fibrosis heterozygotes. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis is associated with increased airway reactivity and its symptoms, and that the cystic fibrosis heterozygotes who manifest airway reactivity and its symptoms may be at risk for poor pulmonary function.\r"

The patients with bronchiectasis all expectorated purulent sputum daily (mean wet weight 47 g/day), had reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (mean 47.5% predicted), and were unable to avoid coughing during the six hour observation period. None of the patients with bronchiectasis or the healthy subjects were current smokers. There were five current smokers in group X and six in group Y. The mean FEV1 in group X was 41% predicted and in group Y 52% predicted, both values similar to that of the patients with bronchiectasis. Tracheobronchial clearance in the first six hours after inhalation of radioaerosol was significantly (p less than 0.01) slower in patients with bronchiectasis than in matched healthy subjects despite more proximal deposition of radioaerosol (p = 0.01) and more coughing (p less than 0.01) in the former. Tracheobronchial clearance in patients with bronchiectasis was impaired to a similar degree to that in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease but no bronchiectasis.\r"

In addition, mean total lung capacity (TLC) was only 81.5% of predicted and 27% of our subjects had values of TLC less than one standard deviation below the mean predicted value. The mean value for transfer factor (TLCO) was 71.8% of predicted and appreciable arterial hypoxaemia was present, which was disproportionate to the mild derangements in pulmonary mechanics. Patients with Eisenmenger physiology had significantly lower values of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) (p less than 0.05) and of maximum mid expiratory flow (p less than 0.05) and significantly higher pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.05) than those with primary pulmonary hypertension, but no other variables were significantly different between the two subpopulations. It is concluded that advanced pulmonary vascular disease in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger physiology is associated not only with severe hypoxaemia but also with altered pulmonary mechanical function.\r"

  ".W": "A single work rate paced step test is described. It was designed to allow the measurement of minute ventilation (VI) and oxygen consumption (VO2), under standardised conditions, during exercise in the clinic and lung function laboratory and in field work. The subjects and the operator found the test simple to perform. The values for ventilation at a given oxygen consumption were similar to those from more complex and stressful tests and had a high degree of reproducibility. The ergometer was a 12 inch (30 cm) step with hand rails. The subjects stepped down, once every four seconds in response to a buzzer for 10 minutes. VI and VO2 were measured with a small portable device. In 53 normal subjects of mean weight 69 (range 49-107) kg, mean VO2 measured during the last 5 minutes of the test was 0.89 (range 0.53-1.52) 1/min. Weight and height were independent contributors to the oxygen cost of stepping. The ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (VIO2, which equals VI divided by VO2) increased with age, and was similar to normal values for ventilation at 1.01/min VO2 obtained by workers who used multiple work rate tests on more complex equipment. The within subject variation in VIO2, expressed as the coefficient of variation (cv) and calculated for each age decade, was 14%. This again compared very favourably with the cv for values of ventilation at 1.01/min VO2 from other studies. In 20 normal subjects daily testing showed significant falls in VO2 and V1 over three days of 4% and 5.9% respectively; VIO2 fell by 2%. Testing over four consecutive weeks showed small significant differences between weeks but no clear trend; the within subject weekly variation accounted for less than 3.5% of the total variance for each of the variables. Testing at least four months apart showed a 3.3% fall in the oxygen cost of stepping. No significant diurnal effects on the exercise responses were found.\r"

Maximum flow at functional residual capacity (FRC) (VmaxFRC) was used as the index of intrathoracic airways function. Peak expiratory flow rate was also measured. Baseline airways resistance and lung volume were determined during quiet breathing in an infant whole body plethysmograph. Measurements were made on separate days before and after nebulised salbutamol 2.5 mg with nebulised saline as control. The results were paradoxical: there was no change in VmaxFRC after saline, but a significant decline in VmaxFRC was found after salbutamol. Peak expiratory flow remained unchanged. These observations suggest that under conditions of forced expiration intrathoracic airways function may be further impaired by nebulised bronchodilator treatment in wheezy infants. When nebulised bronchodilator drugs are used to treat severe airways obstruction in infancy, careful monitoring is essential.\r"

The study was repeated after a 30-40 minute recovery period in seven infants and again on a separate day in 10. The index of response was the provoking concentration of histamine that produced a 30% fall in the maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (PC30), taken from partial forced expiratory flow-volume curves produced in a pressure jacket. Nine of 11 infants had a PC30 of less than 8 g/l. The response was consistent between tests in both the nine responders and the two who failed to respond at 8 g/l. The PC30 was lower in infants with more severe baseline airway obstruction. Spontaneous recovery after challenge was complete in 30 minutes in seven of eight infants studied. The highest doses of histamine caused changes in the configuration of the flow-volume curves and symptomatic cough and wheeze in addition to a change in forced flow rates. This study provides clear evidence of intrathoracic airway responsiveness to histamine in infancy.\r"

Subjects from the first group had apparently been healthy, aged less than 45 years, had had no known risk factors for hyperlipidaemia, and showed extensive coronary artery atheroma (stenosis greater than 50% by diameter). Eleven cases from 485 consecutive autopsies fulfilled these criteria; three showed considerable hypercholesterolaemia (11.2, 11.8, and 21.6 mmol/L). Family studies confirmed the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia in one case; the other two remain unproven. Cholesterol measurement by cholesterol oxidase and quinoneimine dye production is subject to interference by haemolysis; provided that serum haemoglobin is less than 200 mg/dl, the cholesterol underestimate is less than 5%. The decline in serum cholesterol in the group of unselected subjects was 1.7 (0.3-4.9) mmol/L, 50.4 (28-84) h postmortem. Results are means and ranges for seven subjects. Measurement of cholesterol in serum obtained postmortem (provided that the sample is not grossly haemolysed) is a valid approximation of antemortem levels: this measurement should be made when autopsy reveals evidence of premature coronary heart disease. If hypercholesterolaemia is discovered, the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia, a common genetic disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, should be considered and appropriate family studies instituted.\r"

As police technology improves, it becomes apparent that more information for forensic experts will be required in this area. One such area of concern is the use of tear gas by police. This paper addresses the basic types of gas in terms of their chemistry, uses, and medical side effects and complications. Two types of gases--namely, chloroacetophenone (CN) and orthochlorobenzylidenemalontrile (CS)--are discussed in terms of basic properties, unique advantages, and possible harm to the body. CN and CS are relatively safe agents that can be used to control the behavior of a dangerous person. Clinical examples of their use and misuse by police are also reported. Specific guidelines are offered to help ensure a proper assessment of the dangerous person and to protect the health and lives of police personnel, perpetrators, and others exposed to the tear gas. Forensic experts called to testify about the behavior of the disturbed person or to assess the appropriateness of action taken to subdue that person must become more aware of the technology employed by police agencies to accomplish this particular job of protecting public safety.\r"

The majority of single fatal penetrating chest wounds seen at postmortem examinations are caused by firearms and bladed weapons. While penetrating chest wounds occasionally result from fragments of glass, most severe and fatal wounds from glass result from one's falling into or through plate glass and sustaining wounds of the head, face, abdomen, or extremities. A single fatal wound from a dagger-shaped piece of glass is distinctly uncommon. To prevent such an accident from occurring, safety glass must be used in front doors of public institutions.\r"

Furthermore, the mean CV was significantly greater during submaximal trials than during maximal trials. No subject demonstrated a CV greater than 7.5 per cent for maximal trials, but most had CVs greater than 7.5 per cent for submaximal trials. The results suggest that for the subjects tested CVs greater than 7.5 per cent were consistent with feigned weakness. Coefficients of variation above 7.5 per cent were not, however, limited to subjects feigning weakness. Further investigations of strength variability are needed under different conditions before confident judgements can be made about patient performance.\r"

This study was conducted to evaluate whether physical fitness and bone mass in post menopausal women, between the ages of 50-60 years, may influence the degree of kyphosis. The level of physical fitness was determined by 1) calculating maximum oxygen uptake, (VO2 max), attained by a graded exercise treadmill test, and 2) evaluating the muscle strength in performing one repetition maximum on the bench press. In vivo neutron activation analysis was used to measure the bone mineral content in the axial skeleton and proximal femurs. It is expressed as Calcium Bone Index (CaBI). The normal range was 1.00 +/- 0.12 (I.S.D.). The degree of kyphosis was measured indirectly by calculation of an index of kyphosis, (I/K), using a surveyor's flexicurve. Individuals with I/K greater than 13 showed a clinically apparent kyphosis. Fit individuals (VO2 max greater than 29 ml/kg/min) had a significantly lower I/K (p less than 0.001) than average persons. Individuals with normal bone mass (CaBI greater than 0.8) also had a significantly lower I/K (p less than 0.05) than those with bone loss. Similarly, subjects who were fit, and had normal bone mass, had a significantly lower I/K (p less than 0.001) than those who were less fit and had bone loss. There was a significant correlation between I/K and VO2 max (p less than 0.02, df 45), I/K and CaBI (p less than 0.05, df 45) and I/K and bench press (p less than 0.05, df 45).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To gain some insight as to the number and level of patients affected, the kinds of equipment denied, the reasons given for the denial, which third party payers were mostly involved and how the patient and his/her family managed to cope or resolve this problem, a survey was undertaken. Letters were sent to 259 members of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) asking them to list representative cases where requests for equipment deemed necessary were denied. Twenty-eight responses from different institutions were received from sixteen states describing 110 patients and 180 pieces of durable medical equipment denied in 1984 and 1985. Manual wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs, shower/commode chairs, and environmental control units were the four most common equipment items denied by the third party payers. Government agencies ie., Medicaid, Medicare, Vocational Rehabilitation Departments and State Crippled Children's Services were the most frequent deniers, comprising 54% of the total sample. They were followed by private insurance (31%) and Workman's Compensation (3%). By far, the two most common reasons given for denials were: it was not covered by the insurance policy (38%) and it was not medically necessary (30%). Ninety (90) pieces of equipment (50%) were eventually obtained, most often by charity, or through the patient's family resources.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty male college students served as subjects for a study which investigated how artificially-induced ischemia, with and without muscular fatigue, affects the: 1) input/output (IEMG/Force) relationship, and 2) power density spectrum of EMG signals during submaximal static contractions. In the first experiment, subjects maintained constant-force (60% MVC) static handgrip contractions for 55 sec. Following exercise, EMG mean power frequency (MPF) was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced and EMG amplitude (rmsEMG) was significantly (P less than 0.05) increased. With circulation intact during 5 min recovery, MPF and rmsEMG values returned to pre-exercise levels. With ischemic recovery, MPF remained significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than pre-exercise values, while rmsEMG returned to approximately normal levels. In the second experiment, subjects performed either 3 sec ramp (90 N/sec) or constant-force (40% MVC) contractions immediately before, during the final 3 sec of, and 1, 3, 5 and 10 min after a 10 min tourniquet application. No statistically significant differences (P greater than 0.05) in the IEMG/Force slope coefficients, IEMG/Force ratios or MPF were observed for subjects performing either static ramp or constant-force contractions following temporary ischemia. Results suggest that reduced blood flow may contribute to fatigue-induced EMG changes. However, in the absence of motor activity, ischemia is an insufficient stimulus to cause either increased amplitude or frequency shift of the EMG signal during static contractions.\r"

  ".W": "Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) techniques are often used to induce muscle relaxation and increase joint range of motion (ROM). However, the relationship between muscle activation and ROM with PNF is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of three common PNF stretching techniques on hamstring muscle activation and knee extension. Three PNF techniques: stretch-relax (SR), contract-relax (CR) and agonist contract-relax (ACR) were applied to ten male and female subjects aged 23-36 years who were stabilized to isolate knee extension measurements. Knee joint position and EMG activity from quadriceps and hamstring muscles were computer processed throughout technique application. The results revealed mean hamstring EMG activity increased 8-43% within a given trial of ACR and CR respectively, and did not diminish across trials. SR produced a 11% decrease in mean hamstring EMG activity. ACR produced 3-6% greater knee extension values than CR and SR respectively, in spite of 71-155% greater hamstring EMG activity during ACR. The data suggest that CR and ACR do not evoke sufficient relaxation in muscles opposing knee extension to overcome tension facilitation generated by stretch. Thus, increases in ROM are achieved while the hamstrings are under considerable tension. Such tension increases muscle vulnerability to soreness and strain if stretching continues. The degree of knee extension produced via SR, although 3-6% less than CR and ACR, was achieved during simultaneous reduction in hamstring activity and may be the safer stretching technique.\r"

The height of the subject correlated with the H-reflex latency. The amplitudes of maximal M-response and maximal H-reflex were higher in athletes than in normals. During weak voluntary contraction of the muscle studied the 50% H-reflex amplitude increased and during passive stretching of wrist flexors the resting amplitude of the 50% H-reflex decreased.\r"

  ".W": "When a single-muscle learned behavior was superimposed upon natural human treadmill locomotion, in previous work, it operated as a self-contained behavioral unit. The new behavior altered some features, however, of ongoing stepping patterns. These findings prompted broader consideration of how individual muscle actions combine to form large, patterned ensembles. Accordingly, the present experiment constructed a larger, double-muscle learned behavior to see if it would compete with natural treadmill locomotion or combine with it harmoniously. A demanding requirement was made for in-phase bilateral EMG and contraction by rectus femoris (RF), in opposition to its natural out-of-phase interlimb pattern. EMG bursts were controlled, through computer-assisted operant conditioning, by a flash shortly after left heel strike. The new, double ensemble was conditioned rapidly, within 1-6 days, for all four adults. Harmonious stepping continued, for the most part, with little alteration in step cycle timings. Leg positioning was modified appreciably, however, pointing to complex neural mechanisms. The evidence argued that operant conditioning can construct fine-grained behaviors and also participate powerfully across the full range of single- and interlimb coordination.\r"

Patients given fentanyl also had a longer pain-free interval than those who received sufentanil 10 micrograms (p less than 0.02). The sufentanil 50 micrograms group had more patients asleep than the 10 micrograms group and also had more patients with pruritus than the 10 micrograms or 30 micrograms groups (p less than 0.02).

At this frequency there was a further decrease of between 19 and 65% when the positive end expiratory pressure was removed. The findings of this study are intuitively acceptable, since pulmonary stretch receptor activity is proportional to tidal volume, and are in keeping with the clinical impression that high frequency ventilation per se does not eliminate respiratory drive.\r"

The onset, extent and duration of sensory and motor blockade, the quality of anaesthesia, cardiovascular effects and the frequency of side effects were studied. Cephalad spread of analgesia was high (T4-5) with both solutions. Bupivacaine produced a longer duration of action in the lumbar and sacral segments but the duration in the thoracic segments was similar. There was a considerable degree of hypotension in both groups but this responded readily to ephedrine. Hyperbaric lignocaine is an alternative to hyperbaric bupivacaine and its shorter duration of action in the lumbar and sacral segments is advantageous when a fast recovery is desirable.\r"

Recovery after trichloroethylene was not significantly prolonged although postoperative analgesia by visual analogue was better, opiate analgesia was required less frequently and there was less nausea and vomiting than in either of the enflurane groups. We argue for the continued use of trichloroethylene by this technique, because it costs one hundred times less than enflurane and because of the potential morbidity of the postoperative opiate dosage required after enflurane.\r"

The first patient exhibited a transient, two-day improvement of motor performance in the limbs contralateral to the implantation site. He also had significantly longer episodes of normal function for about two months. The second patient reported a minor improvement of balance and gait, again lasting for two months. Electrophysiological studies of the motor readiness and auditory evoked potentials were consistent with increased catecholaminergic activity in the basal ganglia after transplantation in both patients. Positron emission tomography showed no postoperative alteration of receptor density in the putamen. No significant adverse effects of the transplantation were observed in the patients' performance on neurological and psychological tests or in their quantitative electroencephalogram and cerebral blood flow recordings. Immediately after the grafting, one patient showed transient signs of sympathetic hyperactivity, probably caused by release of catecholamines from the implanted tissue into the peripheral circulation. We conclude that catecholamine-rich cellular implants in the basal ganglia have transient beneficial effects in patients with severe Parkinson's disease.\r"

In plaque and inner periplaque regions, all three proteins were substantially reduced due to extensive myelin loss. In outer periplaque regions, MBP and PLP were close to control levels, but MAG was significantly reduced to a mean of 57% of control. All three proteins were close to control levels in the normal-appearing white matter samples. MAG in the various regions was qualitatively examined on Western blots by binding of lectins and by immunostaining with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against carbohydrate and protein epitopes of MAG. Densitometric scanning of these blots did not reveal any qualitative differences in the oligosaccharide or polypeptide moieties of MAG between samples from control subjects and those from multiple sclerosis patients. However, a high proportion of the MAG in the multiple sclerosis samples was often in the form of dMAG, a proteolytic derivative of MAG that is formed by a myelin-associated, Ca2+-activated, neutral protease. The preferential loss of MAG at the periphery of multiple sclerosis plaques may be initiated by its proteolytic conversion to dMAG.\r"

Conversion from oral to intravenous levodopa treatment resulted in an immediate and sustained stabilization of plasma levodopa levels in both the wearing-off and on-off groups. Motor variability also diminished within the first 24 hours of infusion, although to a much greater extent in patients with the wearing-off phenomenon. Over the next 5 to 11 days of intravenous treatment, further reductions in motor fluctuations occurred in both groups, at a substantially faster rate in the wearing-off group than in the on-off group. The degree of immediate stabilization of parkinsonian motor response correlated best with disease duration, whereas the rate of subsequent improvement correlated most closely with levodopa dose. The results support the view that the wearing-off phenomenon may reflect the degeneration of dopamine terminals as a consequence of natural disease progression with a resultant inability to buffer variations in levodopa availability; the on-off phenomenon may reflect additional postsynaptic changes, possibly occurring in response to the nonphysiological fluctuations in synaptic dopamine, which gradually remit during continuous levodopa administration.\r"

Hypothermia produced increased latencies of BAEP waves I, III, and V; the prolongation was more severe for the later components with the result that interpeak latencies I-III, III-V, and I-V were also prolonged. The temperature-latency relationship was nonlinear and best expressed by exponential curve. The latencies of waves I, III, V and the interpeak latency I-V increased roughly 7% for each 1 degree C drop; they doubled at a temperature around 26 degrees C. The amplitude of the BAEP components had a quasiparabolic relationship to temperature; the amplitude rose with hypothermia to 28 degrees or 27 degrees C, but decreased linearly with further cooling. All BAEP components were present at temperatures above 23 degrees C and absent below 20 degrees C. With rewarming, the changes reversed and BAEPs returned to initial prehypothermia status.\r"

We now report that substantial quantities of this protein are found in brain tissue only from patients with Alzheimer's disease. Although trace amounts of A68 may be detected in cases of Guam-Parkinson dementia complex and Pick's disease, accumulation of A68 in neuronal perikarya and particularly in neuronal processes appears to be a unique feature of Alzheimer's disease. A68 can readily be detected in cerebrospinal fluid after concentration and partial purification. These data, combined with the quantitation of immunoreactivity in other neurological diseases, suggest the usefulness of detection of A68 in cerebrospinal fluid for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.\r"

  ".W": "The histochemical distribution of cholinesterases in the cerebral cortex and their response to cholinesterase inhibitors such as physostigmine and tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) were investigated in brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease and control subjects. In the temporal neocortex of the control subjects, most of the cholinesterase activity was located within axons and cell bodies belonging to cholinergic pathways. In keeping with their well-known cholinomimetic effects, physostigmine and THA effectively inhibited this cholinesterase activity. Cholinesterase-containing normal axons (and in some cases cells) were severely depleted in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Although the cerebral cortex of these patients continued to display abundant cholinesterase activity, the location of this enzyme was largely shifted to the neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In fact, the majority of these pathological structures demonstrated intense acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities. Physostigmine and THA were potent inhibitors of these plaque- and tangle-bound cholinesterases as well. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, cholinesterase inhibitors would therefore appear to have a major and widespread effect directly upon the enzymatic activity of plaques and tangles. Consequently, the clinical effects of anticholinesterases in Alzheimer's disease may be based on mechanisms that are different from those that apply to the normal brain.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 62 consecutive patients with progressive autonomic failure (PAF) or multiple system atrophy (MSA) (26 PAF; 36 MSA). Patients were well matched in age (67 vs 66 years), duration (39 vs 36 months), and severity of autonomic failure (median values for PAF and MSA). Peripheral somatic neuropathy occurred in 2 patients with PAF and 7 patients with MSA. Postganglionic sudomotor and vasomotor functions were studied using the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test and supine plasma norepinephrine. The extent and severity of autonomic failure were assessed by the thermoregulatory sweat test, by heart rate responses to deep breathing and the Valsalva maneuver, and by blood pressure recordings. Severe and widespread anhidrosis was found in both PAF and MSA patients. Postganglionic sudomotor failure occurred at the forearm in 50% each of PAF and MSA patients and at the foot in 69% and 66% of PAF and MSA patients, respectively. However, postganglionic sudomotor function was preserved in some patients with anhidrosis on thermoregulatory sweat test, indicating a preganglionic lesion. Vagal abnormalities were found in 77% and 81% of PAF and MSA patients. Supine plasma free norepinephrine values were significantly reduced in PAF (p less than 0.001), but not in MSA, patients. Standing plasma norepinephrine values were reduced in both PAF (p less than 0.001) and MSA (p less than 0.001) patients. We conclude the following: (1) PAF is characterized by combined postganglionic sudomotor and adrenergic failure. (2) MSA is associated with a similar frequency of postganglionic sudomotor failure, but postganglionic adrenergic denervation was uncommon. (3) Preganglionic neuron is also involved in both disorders, but more severely in MSA. (4) Somatic neuropathy may occur.\r"
