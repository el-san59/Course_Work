Rehabilitation outcome was measured by a locally developed rating scale obtained at admission and discharge for all head trauma patients. The PTE and non-PTE groups were comparable in terms of demographic and medical characteristics except for proportion of men, which was higher in the PTE group (84% vs 66%, p less than .05). Both groups demonstrated significant functional gains on all measures during the course of their hospitalization (p less than .01), although the PTE patients demonstrated lower levels of function at admission and discharge on items rated by physical, occupational, speech, and recreation therapists, and by psychologists. Furthermore, PTE patients required a higher level of nursing care on discharge (p less than .05). It appears that PTE does not impede the rehabilitation process but significantly impacts posthospital rehabilitation plans of patients with blunt head injuries.\r"

Control eyes received 100 microL of balanced salt solution or tissue plasminogen activator vehicle. No evidence of a retinal toxic reaction was seen in eyes receiving 25 micrograms of tissue plasminogen activator. One of four eyes injected with 50 micrograms showed loss of photoreceptor cells by light microscopy. Severe retinal damage was seen by ophthalmoscopy, electroretinography, and light microscopy in three of four eyes receiving 75 micrograms of tissue plasminogen activator and in all eyes treated with 100 micrograms of tissue plasminogen activator or equivalent vehicle. These results suggest that the commercial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator formulation has a narrow margin of safety in nonvitrectomized eyes and that a component of the vehicle is the toxic factor.\r"

However, hyphema in human eyes usually results from ocular trauma, and rebleeding is a serious complication. Hemorrhage is also a potential complication of fibrinolytic therapy. We assessed the incidence of rebleeding in an animal model of surgically induced traumatic hyphema after intracameral injection of tissue plasminogen activator (25 micrograms) or physiological saline. Eight eyes were each treated with tissue plasminogen activator or physiological saline at 10 minutes, 24 hours, 48 hours, or 72 hours after injury. Controls were 8 eyes with hyphema but no intracameral injection. No eyes treated with physiological saline (total, 32 eyes) or control eyes rebled. In contrast, the incidence of rebleeding from the injury site in eyes treated with tissue plasminogen activator was 88% (7/8) at 10 minutes, 75% (6/8) at 24 hours, 50% (4/8) at 48 hours, and 0% (0/8) at 72 hours after injury. Treatment of traumatic hyphema with tissue plasminogen activator prior to healing of damaged vascular endothelium may contribute to rebleeding.\r"

In this analysis, almost all the anti-Ro (SS-A)-positive sera that bound beta-gal-Ro also bound affinity-purified 60-kd human Ro (SS-A) (P less than 0.005). Three of the 27 anti-Ro (SS-A) precipitin-positive sera, however, did not show reactivity on Western blot analysis, which suggests that in some sera, antigenicity to Ro (SS-A) is destroyed by denaturation. Of the 22 sera that were reactive with beta-gal-Ro, 2 were not reactive with affinity-purified human Ro (SS-A). Two serum samples that did not react with beta-gal-Ro were also reactive with affinity-purified human Ro (SS-A). Nevertheless, except for a small percentage of Ro (SS-A) precipitin-positive sera, the frequency of antibody binding to the fusion protein was similar to the frequency of binding to the purified antigen in Western blots. Recombinant Ro (SS-A) antigen may therefore be valuable in the serologic evaluation of anti-Ro (SS-A) autoantibodies.\r"

HL-60 cells can be stimulated by vitamin D3 to differentiate along a monocytic pathway. Monocytic HL-60 cells express CD14 (Leu-M3), a macrophage surface marker, and develop the capacity to produce the second complement component (C2) in response to stimulation with cytokines such as gamma-interferon. The effects of GST and tenidap sodium were compared with the effects of dexamethasone and a variety of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in this model system. We found that GST inhibited the capacity of HL-60 cells to produce C2 but did not inhibit the expression of CD14. Tenidap sodium inhibited C2 production as well as CD14 expression, and it partially reversed the decrease in 3H-thymidine incorporation by HL-60 cells, which accompanies monocytic differentiation. At concentrations that inhibited C2 production by HL-60 cells, tenidap sodium did not inhibit C2 production by monocytes. Neither dexamethasone nor the other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs tested possessed these activities. Thus, both GST and tenidap inhibit markers of monocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells, and this activity may relate to their antirheumatic activities.\r"

We have investigated the production of cell-associated IL-1 in uncultured unstimulated adherent monocytes from HIV-infected patients, which reflects ongoing generation of IL-1 by the cells in vivo. High levels of cell-associated IL-1 activity and of cell-associated IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta antigens were found in monocytes from HIV-infected patients as compared with those found in monocytes from normal individuals. Amounts of cell-associated IL-1 were high in patients with AIDS and in patients from Centers for Disease Control groups II and III. Serum-free culture for 24 h of monocytes from HIV-infected individuals in the absence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) resulted in spontaneous release of IL-1 activity from the cells whereas no release occurred upon culture of normal cells. Stimulation of monocytes with LPS induced the release of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta from cells of infected patients. Only IL-1 beta was released from cells of normal individuals. Thus, circulating monocytes from HIV-infected patients are triggered to produce IL-1 in vivo. The present study also indicates that HIV infection is associated with an acquired defect in the intracellular processes regulating IL-1 secretion.\r"

Intrathecal synthesis of anti-HIV-1 immunoglobulin (Ig) G was detectable at a low frequency in individuals with normal immunological parameters, and in the majority of patients with various degrees of immunodeficiency. The intrathecal production of antibodies to HIV-1 was strongly associated with the recovery of the virus from CSF. A relationship between high anti-HIV-1 IgG levels and occurrence of HIV-1 was also found in blood. Patients without overt neurological symptoms exhibited intrathecal synthesis of anti-HIV-1 IgG as often as those with such symptoms. These findings suggest that intrathecal synthesis of antibodies to HIV-1 is related to a persistent HIV-1 antigenic stimulation in the central nervous system (CNS). HIV-1 often seems to elicit a humoral immune response in the CNS, without concomitant overt neurological symptoms.\r"

To date the significance of such serology remains unknown. Nevertheless, an unusual HIV-1 strain has been isolated from the blood of a healthy Gabonese individual who presented an atypical WB. This virus, identified as isolated HIV-1OYl, grew to low titres of reverse transcriptase activity (less than 50,000 cpm/ml) and was not obviously cytopathic. Radioimmunoprecipitation and peptide ELISA studies indicated that the lack of env-specific reactivity was probably due to the absence of antibodies to the viral glycoproteins, rather than the virus encoding a highly divergent envelope protein. Molecular cloning and sequencing of the provirus proved it to be a string of HIV-1 which was genetically closer to European and North American than to African strains. Furthermore the envelope protein sequence contained all the features of a typical HIV-1 env gene. However, the tat gene derived from the proviral clone was functionally defective. Site-directed mutagenesis of this gene showed that this was due to the substitution of an essential cysteine residue for a serine. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of the tat gene, as well as parts of the gag and env gene sequences of HIV-1OYl, showed that essentially all of the proviruses were defective. These data emphasize the need to view HIV isolates as populations of distinct genomes capable of complementing each other.\r"

This system has now been adapted to allow the release of the additional protein by incorporation of a protease cleavage site between the yeast carrier protein and the protein of interest. The purification of the additional protein is facilitated by exploiting the ease with which Ty-VLPs can be purified from other yeast cell components due to their particulate nature. We have used this modified system to produce hybrid particles containing the HIV-1 p24 protein downstream of the recognition sequence for the blood coagulation factor Xa. The p24 was released from the particles by proteolytic cleavage and rapidly separated from the residual particulate material using centrifugation and standard chromatography techniques. This procedure has been used to purify milligram quantities of HIV-1 p24 protein that reacts with anti-p24 sera and elicits the production of p24-specific antibodies in experimental animals.\r"

Twenty-eight per cent of the study population were born and raised in southern Sudan, an area bordering Kenya, Zaire and Uganda, whilst 72% of the study subjects were from northern Sudan. Seventy-eight per cent of the study population had serologic evidence of past hepatitis B infection, and 13 soldiers were confirmed positive for HIV-1 antibody. All 13 HIV-positive soldiers had recently been deployed in southern Sudan. Multivariate analysis indicated an association between living in southern Sudan and both hepatitis B (odds ratio 8.2) and HIV-1 infection (odds ratio 14). Additionally, sexual relations with prostitutes (odds ratio 1.5) and medical injections for schistosomiasis (odds ratio 2.72) were independent predictors of hepatitis B markers in this military population. The findings of this study suggest that sexual promiscuity is a risk factor for hepatitis B transmission in Sudan. They also indicate one possible route for the spread of HIV-1 from central to northern Africa.\r"

During this period the total number of IVDUs in our catchment area remained stable and referral patterns to our hospital were unchanged. A serologic, clinical and risk-factor survey for HIV infection was conducted in our maintenance hemodialysis unit with the objective of evaluating the interrelationship between HIV infection and the increasing incidence of renal failure in IVDUs. The risk of nosocomial transmission of HIV in a hemodialysis unit with an expected high prevalence of infection was also investigated. The effect of HIV seropositivity on the clinical course of patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis was evaluated prospectively. Twenty-seven (39%) out of 70 maintenance hemodialysis patients tested were seropositive for HIV. Twenty-three (88%) out of 26 IVDUs receiving dialysis were seropositive for HIV. Despite marked CD4 cell depletion (mean CD4 cell count 225), none of the seropositive patients had AIDS when first evaluated and only one developed AIDS during 12 months of follow-up. None of the dialysis staff members or dialysis patients without HIV risk factors was seropositive for HIV. IVDUs who develop end-stage renal disease appear to have a high rate of infection with HIV. We can expect that the number of HIV-infected dialysis patients will continue to increase. Fortunately, even in a high prevalence hemodialysis unit, the risk of nosocomial transmission of HIV appears to be low.\r"

The patients remained at low risk of developing AIDS until their CD4 lymphocyte count fell to 0.25 X 10(9)/l. From this point, the risk increased as their count approached zero. Using this result and on the assumption (which is evaluated) that the underlying trend over time in CD4 lymphocyte counts is linear, the predicted rate of progression to AIDS was calculated for the cohort. It was estimated that 73% (95% confidence limits 60-86%) of the cohort will develop AIDS within 15 years of HIV-seropositivity. During 8 years of follow-up, this cohort had shown similar rates of progression to AIDS to other cohorts--haemophilic and otherwise--suggesting that this estimate may well have general applicability. The method described could be used to plan the provision of health-care resources for groups of anti-HIV-positive patients as it allows the number of new cases of AIDS to be predicted year by year, even when the patients' dates of seroconversion are unknown.\r"

On the basis of this observation, the value of S-TK measurements as a predictor of bone marrow toxicity during zidovudine therapy was investigated in 42 patients with AIDS or ARC who received zidovudine as part of their usual treatment. There was a significant association between S-TK, haemoglobin and neutrophil counts measured after the first 4 weeks of therapy and the risk of developing bone marrow toxicity during the following 6 months. Combined, measurements of S-TK and neutrophil counts seem to be well suited for the identification of patients who have a high probability for developing bone marrow toxicity during zidovudine treatment.\r"

Six months later the patient became severely ill, with fever, malaise and multiple skin and laryngeal papules. Cat-scratch disease was diagnosed from the typical epithelioid angiomatosis seen in skin biopsies with bacterium-like structures in the Warthin-Starry stain. Retrospectively these typical structures were also seen in earlier biopsies. All lesions improved after therapy with erythromycin had been instituted.\r"

All the seroconverted animals developed symptoms resembling AIDS and died several months after inoculation. The course of experimental infection of rabbits with BLV resembled in many respects the broad spectrum of clinical disorders associated with AIDS induced by HIV. Antibody response to virus proteins was followed by immune deficiency and signs of neuropathy, and the animals subsequently died of opportunistic infections. Virus transmission from infected babies to the mothers by contact was also observed. In some cases the virus was salvaged from lymphocytes of rabbits with the immune deficiency syndrome. The virus-specific sequences were found to be integrated at random in the DNA of haematopoietic cells and of some organs. Slight expression of viral RNAs in lymphocytes was found. Experimental infection of rabbits with BLV can be used in experiments to understand AIDS induction.\r"

  ".W": "Normal pregnancy is associated with a poorly understood loss of vascular responsiveness to the pressor effects of infused angiotensin II. Since cellular cation metabolism appears to be a critical determinant of basal vascular tone and vascular reactivity, we have evaluated platelet ionized calcium, erythrocyte sodium, calcium and magnesium levels, and erythrocyte Ca-ATPase and Na/K ATPase activity in 15 normal black pregnant women (37.5 +/- 0.6 weeks gestation) and 10 normal age-matched nonpregnant black women. Plasma levels of factors potentially affecting vascular reactivity (endoxin, renin activity (PRA), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP] were measured by RIA and peripheral vascular resistance by biolectrical impedance. Peripheral vascular resistance was almost twice as high (P less than .003) in the normal group as in the pregnant women. Intracellular calcium concentrations were not significantly different in erythrocytes or platelets of the two groups. Although erythrocyte membrane Ca-ATPase was similar, Na/K ATPase activity was significantly higher in the pregnant subjects than in the nonpregnant controls, and intracellular sodium was lower. All three measured plasma factors, ANP, endoxin and PRA, were significantly elevated in the pregnant women. Our results suggest that the decrease in peripheral vascular resistance seen in normal pregnancy is probably not the result of alterations in cellular cation concentrations and/or cell membrane pump activity. However, the significant correlation between vascular reactivity and circulating ANP indicates this potent vasodilator may play a role in the observed decrease in peripheral vascular resistance associated with pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "In feral populations of African green monkeys or vervets (Cercopithecus aethiops), between 5 and 15% of adults have spontaneously elevated blood pressure (BP). We report here the initial biological and pharmacological characterization of this potential animal model of hypertension. Captive male monkeys with elevated systolic pressures show a modest pressure increase in response to stressors such as capture, phlebotomy and cold challenge. Acute captopril administration lowers BP in monkeys with high blood pressure (HBP), but has no effect on BP in control animals. Furosemide does not acutely reduce BP. Animals with elevated BPs have lower levels of angiotensin II than do age- and weight-matched controls. An acute infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) diminishes BP and stimulates urinary output in control and HBP vervets. However, both effects are more pronounced in animals with HBP. Heart rate is not affected by any of the experimental manipulations. Taken together, these data suggest that African green monkeys with spontaneously elevated BP may be a useful experimental model for particular types of human hypertension. Additional studies are required to complete the endocrine and pharmacological characterization of individual animals with HBP.\r"

There was a significant reduction in the echocardiographic measures of left ventricular wall thickness and mass in these patients. There was also an increase in fractional left ventricular mass index, shortening and ejection fraction per 100 g left ventricular mass and no indication in mean circumferential shortening. There was another indication of improved left ventricular performance. With the reduced left ventricular mass and diastolic blood pressure, there was a reduction in the ratio of peak systolic wall stress to fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass. There was a significant relationship between peak systolic wall stress and fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass index. The directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness. These changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo. There was reduction in electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-T changes of ischemia in those patients with diastolic blood pressure reduced to less than 90 mm Hg. Isradipine monotherapy was an effective antihypertensive drug in blacks with essential hypertension, resulting in regression of left ventricular wall thickness and mass and augmentation of fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass.\r"

  ".U": "90148621\r", 
  ".W": "The Health Care Financing Administration's decision to adopt a prospective based payment system has caused many institutions to implement new policies and practices. A recent area of interest for many hospitals has been the creation of diagnosis-related group (DRG) exempt units to maximize reimbursement practices. We analyzed changes which occurred when an eight bed acute care stroke unit (SU) was converted to a DRG exempt eight bed rehabilitation unit (RU). The time period involved was 1 1/2 months before and 1 1/2 months after the transition occurred. Analysis of data from the pre- and posttransition periods revealed that: (1) length of stay increased significantly from 11.7 to 15.3 days (P less than 0.001); (2) functional independence measure (FIM) score improvement was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) for RU patients (0.84/day) than for SU patients (0.39/day); (3) disposition to home v other facilities increased significantly from 50 to 81% (P less than 0.05); (4) the overall occupancy increased from 94 to 100% and all beds were filled with rehabilitation patients; (5) the proportion of patients with Medicare as their primary insurer was comparable before (64%) and after (67%) unit conversion; (6) gross income from rehabilitation patients increased by 43%. Indirect savings via reduction of acute hospital length of stay for Medicare patients increased total income from operation of this unit. We conclude that patients on the RU stayed longer, had greater daily improvements in functional status, and were more likely to be discharged to home. This appears to be due to a more efficient use of rehabilitation beds and a concomitant overall improvement in reimbursement to the hospital.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order to evaluate further the relationship between PF4 and the chondroitin sulfate-containing proteoglycan in resting platelets, the PF4-binding proteoglycan from human platelets has been purified using purified PF4 as an affinity ligand and used to prepare polyclonal antiserum. Two antisera have been characterized: one reacts primarily with chondroitin sulfate (CS), the other reacts with the protein core of the platelet proteoglycan after chondroitinase AC digestion. PF4 and PG core protein antigen are present in separate, dissimilar precipitin arcs when triton-solubilized platelets are analyzed by crossed immunoelectrophoresis using polyclonal antisera to purified PF4 and PG. PF4 was demonstrated in a complex with a separate chondroitin sulfate antigen by crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) experiments in which either anti-PF4 or anti-CS antisera was incorporated in the intermediate gel. Both the PF4-chondroitin sulfate complex and the proteoglycan are secreted from platelets when fresh, washed human platelets are stimulated by human alpha-thrombin. This second antigen may represent the PG after posttranslational modification of a precursor form of the proteoglycan.\r"

  ".W": "The gamma delta T-cell receptor-positive (gamma delta TCR+) lymphocytes were markedly expanded up to 68% of peripheral blood lymphocytes in a case with type I autoimmune polyglandular syndrome and pure red blood cell aplasia (PRCA). The gamma delta TCR+ cells showed CD4 negative, 16% dim-CD8 positive and 10% to 46% human leukocyte antigen-D-related (HLA-DR) positive, and exhibited no monoclonality as assessed by the patterns of TCR gene rearrangements. Functional studies revealed that the proliferative responses of the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were severely depressed to candida antigen, alloantigens, and autoantigens (non-T cells). The gamma delta TCR+ cells had no suppressive effect on the proliferative response of the alpha beta TCR+ cells to candida. The patient's PBMC, isolated gamma delta TCR+ cells but not alpha beta TCR+ cells, exhibited non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the patient's PBMC and isolated gamma delta TCR+ cells inhibited burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E), but not colony-forming units/granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM). Supernatants derived from the patient's T cells similarly inhibited BFU-E but not CFU-GM. The clinical course of the patient also showed a close correlation between the decreased number of total lymphocyte counts, especially HLA-DR + gamma delta TCR+ cell counts, and recovery from PRCA. These observations suggest that the gamma delta TCR+ cells might be functional in vivo and involved in the pathogenesis of PRCA in this patient.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of data collected on patients admitted over four years. SETTING--Community based study. PATIENTS--2430 Consecutive patients living in the Perth statistical division admitted to hospital with myocardial infarction during 1984-7. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Survival at 28 days among patients taking a beta blocker at onset of myocardial infarction. RESULTS--Patients were grouped into those who were and were not taking a beta blocker at the time of admission. Though patients taking a beta blocker were older and more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or hypertension, the overall mortality at 28 days was similar in the two groups. A logistic regression model used to adjust for factors predictive of cardiac death at 28 days confirmed that patients taking a beta blocker at the time of admission had a significantly reduced risk of death (relative risk 0.50; 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.76). Though the incidence of fatal ventricular fibrillation was similar in the two groups, mean peak creatine kinase activity was significantly lower in the beta blocker group. CONCLUSIONS--These data support the value of long term use of beta blockers in patients at risk of myocardial infarction. They suggest that patients taking these agents before admission to hospital with myocardial infarction have a significant survival advantage at 28 days, which may be due to a reduction in infarct size.\r"

All the general practitioners agreed to label as hypertensive patients with systolic pressures of greater than or equal to 200 mm Hg or diastolic pressures of greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg on three consecutive readings. The overall number of patients labelled hypertensive at the beginning of the screening programme was 505 and this rose to 801 after five years. There was a large variation in the numbers of patients recorded as hypertensive at the start of the screening period, with numbers ranging from eight to 112 for individual practitioners. The variation persisted during the screening period, with the numbers of patients detected by individual general practitioners ranging from four to 46. The average systolic and diastolic pressures recorded among these patients also varied between doctors, and only 24 out of 187 patients had their high pressures recorded on three occasions and so fully met the criteria for diagnosing hypertension. Clearly, general practitioners are following their own individual criteria in defining hypertension and taking into account factors other than just the measured blood pressure.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective community based study of blood pressure in relation to overnight oxygen saturation, height, weight, and a questionnaire assessment of snoring, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Analysis was by multiple linear regression techniques and analysis of variance. SETTING--Small town outside Oxford, served by one group general practice of four partners. All measurements were made at home. SUBJECTS--The names of 836 men aged 35-65 were drawn at random from the general practitioners' age and sex register and the men then asked to participate; 752 (90%) agreed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures and their association with age, obesity, alcohol consumption, cigarette consumption, snoring, and overnight hypoxaemia. RESULTS--Though systemic blood pressure correlated significantly with overnight hypoxaemia, this was due to the cross correlation with age, obesity, and alcohol consumption. No independent predictive effect of overnight hypoxaemia was found. Snoring was correlated with systemic blood pressure but not significantly so and also was not an independent predictor once age, obesity, and alcohol consumption had been allowed for. CONCLUSIONS--It is unlikely that snoring and sleep hypoxaemia from occult sleep apnoea are important causes of diurnal systemic hypertension when compared with age, obesity, and alcohol consumption. The increased prevalence of cardiovascular complications reported in snorers may be due to the confounding variable of obesity or to nocturnal rises in blood pressure that are not reflected in the daytime figures.\r"

Mortality also varied depending on the referring hospital. CONCLUSIONS--When transfer of critically ill patients is required this should be done as early as possible to make best use of the services available. The mortality of patients transferred after 10 days casts doubt on whether further aggressive intensive therapy is appropriate.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective survey of the current functions of a specialist interhospital transfer team from data collected at the time of transfer and from records of intensive care unit. SETTING--Mobile intensive care unit based at a tertiary referral centre, which serves the west of Scotland. PATIENTS--All critically ill patients (378) transferred between hospitals by the unit from 1986 to 1988. RESULTS--365 Patients were transferred by road and 13 by air. There was a wide variation in age (range 6 weeks to 87 years), diagnosis, reason for transfer, support required, and distance travelled. Most patients (232) were transferred for respiratory or cardiovascular support; 100 were trauma cases. 300 Patients (79%) were mechanically ventilated during transfer. No patient died in transit, although the eventual mortality was 28% (105 patients). Mortality was significantly higher in patients transferred from hospitals with intensive care units than from those without (38% (125 patients) v 23% (253); p less than 0.005). IMPLICATIONS--Safe interhospital transfer of critically ill patients is feasible; the high eventual mortality in some patient groups emphasises the need for accurate prediction of outcome if inappropriate transfer is to be avoided. The findings may help in organising secondary transfer services in future.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective review of children who died with head injuries from 1979 to 1986 from data of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, Hospital Activity Analyses, case notes, coroners' records, and necropsy reports. SETTING--District general hospitals and two regional neurosurgical centres in Northern region. RESULTS--255 Children died from head injury in the region, the mortality being 5.3 per 100,000 children per year. Head injury was the single most important cause of death in children aged greater than 1 year, accounting for 15% of deaths in children aged 1-15 years and a quarter for those aged 5-15 years. 121 Potentially avoidable factors possibly or probably contributing to death occurred in 81 children (32%). Half the children (125) died before admission, 27 of whom (22%) had potentially avoidable factors possibly or probably contributing to death, and 130 died after admission, 54 of whom (42%) had 93 such factors, which included failure of diagnosis or delayed recognition of intracranial haemorrhage or associated injury, inadequate management of the airways, and poor management of the transfer between hospitals. IMPLICATIONS--Regions should revise urgently their guidelines for optimal management and indications for neurosurgical referral to include children with severe head injuries and audit their systems of care for all patients with head injuries.\r"

DESIGN--To preserve consistency, the same anonymous questionnaire, which was confidential to the research workers, was used throughout. SETTING--Three secondary schools in Wolverhampton in different parts of the town and representing different social groups. SUBJECTS--Sample sizes ranged from 471 fourth year pupils (aged 14 to 15) in 1969 to 540 in 1984 and 380 in 1989, the decrease being due mainly to the falling birth rate. There were slightly more girls than boys, and the pupils covered the whole range of academic ability. RESULTS--Over the 20 years the proportion of pupils who knew someone taking drugs more than doubled from 15% (71) to 31% (117) and the proportion who had been offered drugs almost quadrupled from 5% (24) to 19% (72). The changes taking place over the past five years were characterised by an increased knowledge about drugs and the first mention of \"crack,\" a purified form of cocaine, and \"ecstasy\" (methylenedioxymethamphetamine). Peer influence continued to be given as the prime reason for taking drugs. Over the 20 years, though less often mentioned in 1989, television and newspapers remained the most common source of information. CONCLUSIONS--These results suggest the need for responsible coverage by the mass media and for more effective health and social education programmes to prevent the spread of drug misuse.\r"

One patient with minimal left main stem and right coronary artery atheroma had uptake of antibody at two discrete sites. CONCLUSIONS--Immunoscintigraphy with antibody to myosin confirms myocardial infarction in the absence of electrocardiographic changes and discloses the site of infarction.\r"

DESIGN--Closed, randomised, sequential trial. Pairs of women were allocated to each treatment by the toss of a coin. SETTING--Supraregional clinic for women who had had recurrent spontaneous abortions. SUBJECTS--Forty two women with polycystic ovarian disease and primary recurrent spontaneous abortions. INTERVENTIONS--Ovulation was induced by clomiphene or pituitary suppression with buserelin followed by pure follicle stimulating hormone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Preference for a particular treatment was noted. A preference occurred when one woman in a pair had a successful pregnancy (defined as one of over 12 weeks' gestation) and one had a spontaneous abortion; the preference was for the treatment resulting in the successful pregnancy. RESULTS--Spontaneous abortions occurred in 11 of 20 women given clomiphene compared with two of 20 who had pituitary suppression. Eleven preferences were found for buserelin and two for clomiphene. In seven pairs both women had successful pregnancies. One pair was discarded because one of the women did not become pregnant. The ratio of luteinising hormone concentration to follicular diameter was found to be a possible diagnostic indicator of spontaneous abortion. CONCLUSION--Pituitary suppression before induction of ovulation significantly reduces the risk of spontaneous abortion in women with polycystic ovarian disease and primary recurrent spontaneous abortions.\r"

DESIGN--Examination of consecutive serum samples from patients with illnesses compatible with acute cytomegalovirus infection or exanthem subitum by indirect immunofluorescence for the presence of antibodies to human herpesvirus type 6. An IgG absorption step was included to avoid false positive and negative results for IgM. The criterion standard for diagnosis of human herpesvirus type 6 infection was the presence of IgM human herpesvirus type 6 antibody (titre greater than 20) and a rising titre of IgG human herpesvirus type 6 antibody without serological evidence of alternative infection. SETTING--Routine viral diagnostic and reference laboratory in the largest teaching hospital in Sydney. PATIENTS--341 Consecutive serum samples were analysed from patients with hepatitis (147 samples); infectious mononucleosis-like illness (106); screens for toxoplasma, other viruses, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpesvirus (38); fever in an immunocompromised patient (eight); unusual neurological (nine) or haematological syndromes (14); splenomegaly (six); and rash in a child (13). RESULTS--Three cases of acute human herpesvirus type 6 infection were identified: in one patient aged 65 with a previous diagnosis of acute non-A non-B hepatitis, one aged 25 with a glandular fever-like illness, and one aged 6 with a glandular fever-like illness. All three illnesses resolved completely. 15 Further serum samples were positive for human herpesvirus type 6 antibody but were also diagnostic for acute infection with other viruses (cytomegalovirus (nine), Epstein-Barr virus (three), and HIV (one] or had a titre of IgM human herpesvirus type 6 antibody less than 20 (two). CONCLUSIONS--Acute human herpesvirus type 6 infection in immunocompetent patients may result in a mononucleosis-like illness or an acute but self limiting hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the effect of discharge information given to general practitioners on their management of newly discharged elderly patients. DESIGN--A random sample of 133 elderly patients who had unplanned readmission to a district general hospital within 28 days of discharge was compared with a matched control sample of patients who were not readmitted. Information was gathered from the hospital, the patients, the carers, and the general practitioners about the information that the hospital had sent the general practitioner and the general practitioners' response to this information. SETTING--All specialties in a district general hospital. PATIENTS--266 Patients aged over 65 representative in the main demographic indices of the population of elderly patients admitted to hospital. RESULTS--Ten weeks after discharge the doctors had received notice of discharge about 169 of the patients, but fewer than half the discharge notices were received within the first week. General practitioners were dissatisfied with the information in 60 cases. A general practitioner visited 174 of the patients after their discharge from hospital and three quarters of the visits took place within two weeks of the discharge. These visits were more likely to have been initiated by patients or families than by the doctor, and this was not influenced by the doctor receiving notice of the patient's discharge. Older patients and those who had carers were the most likely to be visited. Nearly half of the carers were dissatisfied with some aspect of general practitioner care, problems with home visiting being the commonest source of complaint. CONCLUSIONS--Hospital communications to general practitioners about the discharge of elderly patients still cause concern, particularly in the time they take to arrive. Written instruction to vulnerable elderly patients asking them to inform their general practitioner of the discharge might be helpful. Carers complained of lack of support, and it is clearly important for someone (either the general practitioner or another health worker) to visit elderly people shortly after their discharge.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Interobserver and intraobserver variability of blood pressure measurements in the two groups expressed as the coefficient of variability and compared by the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS--Interobserver variability was significantly greater in the patients with atrial fibrillation for both systolic and diastolic pressures. Intraobserver variability was significantly greater in the atrial fibrillation group for diastolic pressures but the difference was not significant for systolic pressures. These differences were not related to pulse rate, age, or level of blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS--The findings suggest that in the presence of atrial fibrillation physicians' interpretations of Korotkoff sounds are less uniform, which may have important clinical implications. Possibly a standardised methodology may overcome this problem.\r"

DESIGN--An \"electronic questionnaire\" in the form of an interrogation questionnaire was used to extract a subset of data from practice computers running a standard software package (the general practice administrative system for Scotland, GPASS). The data were retained by each practice and also collected and analysed centrally to produce regional and national data. SUBJECTS--All 257 general practices in Scotland using GPASS software were sent the electronic questionnaire; data from 154 practices, including 759 general practitioners and covering 1,010,452 patients, were collected. RESULTS--Ninety three practices had all their patient records on computer; others had selectively entered data on, for example, only those patients receiving repeat prescriptions. The number of computerised patient records per practitioner ranged from 46 to 2373. Altogether 194,261 patients had repeat prescribing data and 204,005 morbidity or clinical data. CONCLUSION--An electronic questionnaire is a simple and effective way of investigating the information held on practice computers, allowing analysis and feedback of information to practitioners. Development of this system will provide a cumulative information system for Scottish general practitioners.\r"

  ".W": "Many patients with cancer enjoy long-term survival and are cured; others may live for extended periods while receiving specific treatment for cancer. This has been accomplished with increasingly complex and multimodal therapy, along with heightened toxicity and longer treatment. Cancer has become a chronic disease for many patients. Contemporary cancer rehabilitation provides a coordinated approach that addresses the physical, psychosocial, vocational, and economic concerns of the patient. Key components of a cancer rehabilitation program should include initial needs assessment with periodic reassessments, direct provision of specific interventions, and referrals to appropriate community resources. Almost all patients with cancer can benefit from a rehabilitation assessment and intervention. Important rehabilitation issues include the physical toxicity of treatment, psychosocial concerns, sexual dysfunction, diet and nutritional concerns, pain management, and vocational and economic problems. Patient groups with unique rehabilitation problems include patients with head and neck cancer or breast cancer, and patients who have undergone osteotomies or amputations. Long-term cancer survivors also have special rehabilitation needs that relate to the delayed effects of treatment on normal tissues, gonadal dysfunction, second neoplasms, employment discrimination, and difficulties obtaining health and life insurance coverage. Rehabilitation assessment and intervention should be incorporated into the routine health care of patients with cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Attempts to duplicate the cytotoxic effect of oxygen on radioresistant tissues spurred a search by radiation oncologists for other radiosensitizing techniques. This led to large-scale investigations using neutrons and other heavy particle radiations, hyperthermia, altered fractionation schedules, and the systemic use of the halogenated pyrimidines and the electron-affinic compounds. Unfortunately, the promise that the nitroimidazole compounds would selectively sensitize the radioresistant tumor cells and prove to be an effective systemic agent has not been borne out in clinical trials thus far. Existing pharmokinetic and cytokinetic studies have suggested that continuous infusion chemotherapy given concomitantly (CCIC) with irradiation (RT) acts synergistically, resulting in a significant increase in tumor cell killing. These observations have been supported by clinical research studies treating certain epithelial cancers that have resulted in considerably higher locoregional control rates and improved survival. Although initially used in treatment of only advanced or inoperable epithelial carcinomas, CCIC and RT are now being employed in the treatment of lower staged cancers as an organ-sparing procedure. Carcinoma of the anus treated by anteroposterior (AP) resection alone have reported 5-year survival rates of 30% to 60%. CCIC and RT using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C have achieved a local control rate of 90% to 100% and a 5-year survival rate of 80% to 86% with sphincter preservation in 90% of these cases. The 5-year survival rate in advanced urinary bladder carcinoma is 25% to 30% for either radiation or surgery and 42% when combined in a preoperative radiation schedule. Using 5-FU CCIC and RT, the local control rate of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder has been 71% to 86% with a 5-year survival of 62%. 5-FU CCIC and cisplatin and RT used in the treatment of Stages III and IV carcinoma of the cervix yields a locoregional control of 74% compared with the radiation alone local control of 63% for Stage III and 30% for Stage IV disease. Advanced head and neck and paranasal sinus carcinomas treated by cisplatin CCIC and RT show improved tumor clearance even in the presence of bone destruction. A complete response rate of 87% has been reported with the use of cisplatin CCIC and hyperfractionated radiation. Hyperfractionated radiation also appears to improve the local control of advanced head and neck cancers over patients treated with single fractions of radiation with 66% surviving at 22 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The regional-development of heterotopic bone around the hip and the influence of postoperative prophylaxis with antiinflammatory drugs were studied in 66 patients treated with 74 noncemented, porous-coated total hip arthroplasties (THA) using the McFarland approach. Thirty patients (34 hips) were treated with antiinflammatory drugs during the early postoperative period. Heterotopic bone developed in two different regions: central, around the neck of the femoral component, and lateral to the greater trochanter of the femur. Central ossifications were recorded in 53% of the hips and appeared significantly less frequently in patients postoperatively treated with antiinflammatory drugs. Lateral ossifications were recorded in 71% of the hips, and no significant prophylactic effect was found for postoperative antiinflammatory treatment. In response to the McFarland approach in THA, heterotopic ossifications may appear both centrally around the neck of the femoral component and lateral to the trochanter in the substance of the medial gluteal muscle. The latter may be comparable to post-traumatic myositis ossificans.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, could effectively ablate ictal activity in an animal model without significant cardiorespiratory compromise. Ten domestic swine (10 to 20 kg) were ventilated and hemodynamically monitored. Bifrontal craniotomies were performed and electrocortical activity was recorded throughout the experiment. Pentylenetetrazol (100 mg/kg) was administered iv to induce seizures. Midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) was administered iv and serum levels were drawn at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after administration. There was no significant difference between the baseline and postmidazolam vital signs. Seizure activity was seen periodically as generalized spikes, as well as individual spikes for 29 +/- 5 sec after midazolam administration. A period of attenuation of 24 +/- 7 sec was seen before returning to baseline electrocortical activity. Our study demonstrates that midazolam effectively ablated induced ictal activity without significant cardiorespiratory depression and with similar EEG effect as other benzodiazepines.\r"

Nutritionists have empirically observed that adding albumin to TPN solutions can quickly normalize hypoalbuminemia for sustained periods. Infusion of similar quantities of albumin without TPN results in no prolonged normalization. The mechanism of the rapid normalization of serum albumin with albumin-modified TPN solutions has yet to be determined, as has its relationships to prevention of hypoalbuminemia-associated morbidity and mortality.\r"

In rats given 1 ml of 0.6 N HCl intragastrically, severe hemorrhagic lesions were observed in the gastric corpus mucosa 15 min, and 1, 3, and 5 hr after HCl administration. In the control rats treated with physiological saline, LTs in gastric mucosa were not observed throughout the experiments. Peptide LT contents (sum of LTC4 and LTD4) after 1 or 3 hr were increased to 13.2 +/- 2.9 ng/g tissue and 6.3 +/- 1.9, respectively, although peptide-LTs were not observed 15 min and 5 hr after HCl administration. Premedication with AA-861, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, decreased dose-dependently peptide LT contents 1 hr after HCl administration. Furthermore, gastric lesions caused by 0.6 N HCl were significantly prevented by 300 mg/kg of AA-861 3 hr after HCl administration, although the dose of AA-861 did not significantly prevent gastric lesions 1 hr after HCl administration. Administration of YM-638, a peptide LT antagonist, showed similar protective effects to AA-861 except inhibition of increase in LT levels after HCl administration. These results suggest that peptide LTs contribute to persistence of gastric lesions, although they might not participate in the onset of 0.6 N HCl-induced gastric lesions.\r"

Before treatment, seizure duration ranged from 43.8 +/- 5.1 to 49.6 +/- 5.2 s with an ECS stimulus of 10-V, 100-Hz, 0.1-ms pulses for 5 s. Each drug was administered into the right internal intracarotid artery 2 min before the ECS. A cumulative nimodipine dose of 440 micrograms/kg decreased seizure discharge to 6.6 +/- 5.0 s (p less than 0.001), whereas a total dose of 1.0 mg/kg PN200-110 was required to achieve a similar effect. Nicardipine was ineffective. A cumulative dose of 7 mg/kg phenytoin was required to suppress seizure discharge. These results indicate that Ca2+ channels modulated by dihydropyridines play a facilitating role in ECS-induced seizures. We propose that the anticonvulsant effects of nimodipine and PN200-110 are due to inhibition of neuronal calcium L-channels. Dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonists that penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and bind to neuronal tissue may emerge as a novel class of anticonvulsants.\r"

We examined the long-term effects of continual intake of phenobarbital (PB) on SER as a method of assessing long-term evaluation of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Food pellets containing 0.1% PB were given ad libitum from 7 weeks of age. Plasma PB level was maintained at 30-70 micrograms/ml after age 11 weeks. Tonic seizures were inhibited markedly in rats that received PB until age 15-16 weeks, but thereafter the inhibitory effects of PB gradually decreased. An increase of body weight and prolongation of survival were also noted in SER that received PB. Cortical and hippocampal EEG of SER were recorded with chronically implanted electrodes from 11 weeks of age pre-PB and 3, 7, and 14 days post-PB intake. These animals exhibit absence-like seizures characterized by sudden appearance of 5-7-Hz spike-wave-like complexes on EEG concomitant with immobility and staring. The seizures were not affected until age 13 weeks (2 weeks after intake of PB), although tonic seizures were inhibited. SER are considered a useful model for evaluating the long-term effects of AEDs.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the subcellular mechanism of action of sulfonylurea on glucose utilization of skeletal muscle, we studied nine newly diagnosed patients with type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes. Examinations were performed before and after 8 wk of gliclazide therapy. Gliclazide treatment was associated with improved glycemic control and enhanced pancreatic beta-cell responses to meal stimulation. During euglycemic insulin clamps, insulin-inhibited endogenous glucose production was improved after gliclazide therapy. Moreover, mean (+/- SE) glucose disposal rate increased from 3.2 +/- 0.7 to 4.8 +/- 0.8 and from 7.9 +/- 0.9 to 10.4 +/- 0.9 mg.kg-1.min-1 at in vivo plasma insulin levels of approximately 75 and approximately 320 mU/L, respectively. In addition, insulin-receptor function and glycogen synthase activity were analyzed in skeletal muscle biopsies obtained in seven patients. The biopsies were obtained during basal insulinemia and hyperinsulinemia (approximately 320 mU/L) before and after treatment. Insulin receptors purified with wheatgerm agglutinin showed unchanged insulin-binding properties and unchanged receptor kinase function with respect to basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of exogenous peptide poly(Glu80Tyr20). Gliclazide treatment had no effect on the maximal activities of glycogen synthase. Moreover, in biopsies obtained at basal insulinemia, the half-maximal activation constant for glucose 6-phosphate (A0.5) was identical before and after therapy (0.54 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.05 mM, respectively, NS). However, in biopsies obtained at hyperinsulinemia, A0.5 was 0.30 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.02 mM before and after gliclazide therapy, P less than .04.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Degenerative axonal lesions, which can be prevented by insulin administration, have been reported in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) of STZ-D rats. However, direct evidence connecting anatomic MBH lesions with functional impairment is still missing. We therefore performed a combined functional and morphological investigation in 4-mo-old STZ-D male rats (diabetes lasted 1 mo), applying an in vitro model to study in the same isolated MBH 1) the basal and depolarization-induced thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) release during two successive incubations of 20 min each and 2) morphological and morphometric aspects, including distribution and amount (densitometric evaluation) of immunoreactive TRH in the incubated tissue. In basal conditions, TRH release was much lower in diabetic than control MBH during both incubations (P less than .01 vs. P less than .05). In depolarizing conditions, TRH release was increased during the second incubation in control (P less than .05) and during both incubations in diabetic (P less than .01) rats, the percentage increase of the TRH release due to ionic stimulation being much higher in diabetic than control animals (P less than .01). As determined by light-microscope morphometry, the total area of dilated-axon cross sections was larger in diabetic than control MBH under basal conditions (P less than .01), thus confirming degenerative axonopathy in diabetic rats. By densitometry determination, the amount of immunoreactive TRH was higher in stimulated diabetic MBH compared with both stimulated control and basal diabetic MBH (P less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is known to inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion, it is uncertain whether PGE2 actions on the beta-cell are direct, whether they are equipotent for both phases of hormone secretion, and whether the same mechanism of action prevails throughout. Study of the HIT cell, a clonal line of pancreatic beta-cells, provides answers to these questions because perifusion with glucose and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine stimulates biphasic insulin secretion. Perifusion with PGE2 decreased both the first and second phases of glucose-induced insulin release to 47 +/- 4% of controls. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin partly prevented PGE2 inhibition to 80 +/- 4% of controls for first phase and 79 +/- 4% of controls for second phase. To evaluate whether the partial prevention of PGE2 inhibition seen with pertussis toxin pretreatment was caused by Gi heterotrimer association between the preincubation period and the end of perifusion, PGE2 actions were also examined during continuous treatment with pertussis toxin. Under these conditions, PGE2 inhibition of both phases was totally prevented. However, no difference was observed in membrane protein ADP ribosylation when cells were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after pretreatment or continuous treatment with pertussis toxin. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation was inhibited by PGE2 (from 3263 +/- 153 to 1549 +/- 158 fmol/10(6) cells) but less so after pretreatment with pertussis toxin (correlation between insulin release and cAMP accumulation during perifusion; n = 18, r = .85, P less than .001). Thus, PGE2 equally inhibits both phases of glucose-induced insulin secretion and cAMP generation through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-mediated direct effect on the pancreatic beta-cell.\r"

Nerve water content was determined by taking the difference between dry and wet weights of whole tibial nerves. PA was determined by an intravenous bolus injection of radiotracer with multiple-time-point graphic and quantitative autoradiographic methods. The mean nerve water content in galactosemic rats was 15% higher than in control rats after 7-11 mo on the diet. Statil and AL 1576 prevented nerve edema, but CGS 12970 was only partially effective in preventing an increase in nerve water content in galactose-fed rats. In galactosemic rats, the mean PA to sucrose at the blood-nerve barrier, calculated from nerve dry weight, was twofold higher than in control rats. Treatment with Statil, AL 1576, or CGS 12970 prevented increased PA. Our results suggest that nerve edema and increased blood-nerve barrier PA are secondary to polyol production and can be prevented by inhibiting aldose reductase.\r"

Many of these receptors share considerable amino acid sequence homology, particularly in the transmembrane domains. All of these macromolecules share other similarities that include one or more potential sites of extracellular N-linked glycosylation near the amino terminus and several potential sites of regulatory phosphorylation that are located intracellularly. By using a variety of techniques, it has been demonstrated that various regions of the receptor molecules are critical for different receptor functions. The seven transmembrane regions of the receptors appear to form a ligand-binding pocket. Cysteine residues in the extracellular domains may stabilize the ligand-binding pocket by participating in disulfide bonds. The cytoplasmic domains contain regions capable of interacting with G proteins and various kinases and are therefore important in such processes as signal transduction, receptor-G protein coupling, receptor sequestration, and down-regulation. Finally, regions of these macromolecules may undergo posttranslational modifications important in the regulation of receptor function. Our understanding of these complex relations is constantly evolving and much work remains to be done. Greater understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in G protein-coupled, receptor-mediated signal transduction may provide leads into the nature of certain pathophysiological states.\r"

Arterial blood pressures of 101/57 and 104/57 mm Hg (subjects with normotensive and hypertensive parents, respectively) were not significantly different between the two groups. Forty-four children had normotensive parents and 39 had hypertensive parents, 51 were white and 32 were black, and 41 were girls and 42 were boys. By using the [3H]ouabain-binding technique, we determined the density of sodium pump sites and the equilibrium dissociation constants in erythrocytes from these children. Possible effects of race, sex, or parental hypertension status on pump sites and dissociation constants were tested with a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Race had a major effect on the dissociation constant: blacks had a significantly higher value than did whites (p = 0.002). We also found a race by sex by parental hypertension status interaction (p = 0.04) with black girls with hypertensive parents having the highest value. There was no effect of race, sex, or status on sodium pump site density. Age, height, weight, resting arterial blood pressure, and plasma Na+ and K+ concentrations did not correlate with the dissociation constants. These data suggest that, among the groups we studied, black girls with hypertensive parents had erythrocytes with the lowest binding affinity for ouabain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SCH 34826 (10, 30, and 90 mg/kg s.c. and 90 mg/kg p.o.) potentiated the antihypertensive action of atrial natriuretic factor (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. SCH 34826 (90 mg/kg) also potentiated the diuretic and natriuretic responses to atrial natriuretic factor (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) as well as the plasma levels achieved after peptide injection. SCH 34826 significantly reduced blood pressure in the conscious deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rat, at doses of 90 mg/kg s.c. (-35 +/- 12 mm Hg), 10 mg/kg p.o. (-30 +/- 7 mm Hg), and 90 mg/kg p.o. (-45 +/- 6 mm Hg). SCH 34826 was devoid of acute antihypertensive activity in the spontaneously hypertensive rat but reduced blood pressure by day 3 of a 5-day treatment schedule. SCH 34826 (90 mg/kg s.c.) enhanced urine volume output in the deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rat (2.78 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.3 ml/100 g/3 hr in vehicle-control rats, p less than 0.05). SCH 34826 (90 mg/kg s.c.) increased plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor at 1 hour (753 +/- 89 vs. 451 +/- 79 pg/ml in vehicle-treated rats, p less than 0.05) but not 3 hours after dosing. The renal excretion of atrial natriuretic factor (3,092 +/- 1,089 vs. 21 +/- 6 pg/100 g/3 hr in vehicle-treated rats, p less than 0.05) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (2,131 +/- 509 vs. 879 +/- 168 pg/100 g/3 hr in vehicle-treated rats, p less than 0.05) was markedly elevated by SCH 34826 in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rats.

  ".W": "The modulation exerted by atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on the cardiac and vascular influences of arterial baroreceptors was investigated in two groups of unanesthetized, chronically instrumented normotensive rats. In group 1, the reflex control of heart rate was assessed by graded baroreceptor stimulations and deactivations obtained by intravenous boluses of phenylephrine and nitroprusside. Under either circumstance, baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was expressed as the linear regression slope relating the chronotropic responses to the drug-induced mean arterial pressure changes. In group 2, right common carotid occlusion was performed in rats with their aortic and left carotid sinus baroreceptors denervated to assess the baroreceptor control of blood pressure; the reflex response was quantitated as the peak blood pressure rise observed during the maneuver. The reflex studies were performed before and during atriopeptin III infusion (0.15-0.20 micrograms/kg/min for 60 minutes). ANF augmented the bradycardic response to phenylephrine by 102.5 +/- 29% (p less than 0.01), reduced the tachycardic response to nitroprusside by 67.7 +/- 6.4% (p less than 0.01), and failed to modify the pressor response to carotid occlusion (-6.8 +/- 2.1%, p = NS). In a separate group of rats infused with low dose nitroprusside, no change in the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex was observed. ANF infusion (0.20 micrograms/kg/min) performed in further separate groups of conscious rats raised plasma ANF to 480 +/- 58 fmol/ml. Values in control vehicle-infused rats were 50 +/- 8 fmol/ml. Vascular reactivity (pressor response to intravenous phenylephrine boluses in anesthetized, sinoaortic-denervated rats) was only minimally reduced by ANF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies demonstrated that acute infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) produces an enhanced depressor response in NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) fed a high (8%) NaCl diet compared with control SHR-S fed a normal (1%) NaCl diet and that dietary NaCl loading increases circulating ANF levels in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats but not in SHR-S. The current study tested the hypotheses that 1) long-term infusion of ANF at a dose that elevates plasma ANF to levels comparable with those seen in high NaCl-fed WKY rats prevents the NaCl-induced exacerbation of hypertension in SHR-S and 2) ANF lowers blood pressure in this model by a sympatholytic effect. Male SHR-S received infusions of ANF (0.1 microgram/hr) or vehicle intravenously via osmotic minipump for 3 weeks beginning immediately before initiation of 1% or 8% NaCl diets at age 7 weeks. Chronic ANF infusion prevented the increase in arterial pressure in response to a high NaCl diet in SHR-S but had no effect in 1% NaCl-fed SHR-S. Thus, the NaCl-sensitive component of hypertension in SHR-S was more sensitive to ANF than the non-NaCl-sensitive component. Plasma norepinephrine was significantly increased in ANF-treated, 8% NaCl-fed SHR-S compared with vehicle controls, suggesting that ANF did not prevent NaCl-sensitive hypertension by a sympatholytic effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups. Groups I and II were on the low salt diet and groups III and IV on the high salt diet from 6 weeks of age. Additionally, at 10 weeks of age groups I and III were placed on 100% water and groups II and IV on 25% deuterium oxide. At 14 weeks, systolic blood pressure, uptakes of calcium, and rubidium 86 by aortas were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in rats on the high salt diet as compared with those on the low salt diet. Deuterium oxide intake normalized systolic blood pressure and aortic calcium uptake but not aortic rubidium 86 uptake in hypertensive rats on the high salt diet. Deuterium oxide had no effect on blood pressure or aortic calcium uptake in rats on the low salt diet. The parallel increase in systolic blood pressure and vascular calcium uptake suggests that increased calcium uptake mechanisms are associated with hypertension in salt-sensitive Dahl rats. Furthermore, deuterium oxide appears to normalize elevated blood pressure in salt-sensitive hypertensive rats by normalizing elevated vascular (aortic) calcium uptake.\r"

  ".W": "Indapamide, a nonthiazide diuretic, exhibits direct vasodilator action as well as natriuretic and diuretic effects. Although calcium antagonist-like activity has been addressed so far, the mechanisms for vasodilator effect are still uncertain. To understand the wide range of indapamide actions, we examined the effects of indapamide on the vascular eicosanoid generation and investigated its mechanisms by using rat vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. Indapamide uniquely increased the prostacyclin generation in the vascular smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it did not affect the vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2. Thiazide diuretics lowered the prostacyclin generation, while nonthiazide derivatives did not affect the biosynthesis. Enzymatic analysis revealed that indapamide affected neither [14C]arachidonate liberation nor prostacyclin synthase of the smooth muscle cells. Indapamide eliminated a stable free radical in a cell-free system, lowered the formation of malondialdehyde from lipid peroxides in rat brain homogenate, and reduced lipid peroxidation by the free radical generating system of xanthine-xanthine oxidase. Indeed, the scavenging action of indapamide significantly attenuated the inhibitory activity of 15-hydroperoxy-arachidonate to prostacyclin synthase activity. These results indicate that indapamide diuretic increases prostacyclin generation in the vascular smooth muscle cells possibly through antioxidant effects and that the enhanced prostacyclin generation is partly responsible for its direct vasodilator action.\r"

  ".W": "Renal functional reserve, microalbuminuria, and plasma atrial natriuretic factor were measured in 21 offspring (9.5 +/- 0.5 years of age, mean +/- SEM) of hypertensive parents and in eight children (10 +/- 0.5 years of age) with no family history of hypertension who were used as a control group. Renal functional reserve was evaluated by measurement of the changes in creatinine clearance after an oral protein load of 45 g/m2. Atrial natriuretic factor levels were determined before and 60 minutes after the protein load, and microalbuminuria in fractional urine before and 120 minutes after the same stimulus as well as in a 24-hour urine collection. All children in the control group significantly increased their creatinine clearance after the protein load (preload, 122 +/- 12; 60 minutes, 144 +/- 9; 120 minutes, 154 +/- 11; 180 minutes, 144 +/- 9 ml/min/1.73 m2; all values were significant vs. preload, p less than 0.005). In contrast, only 13 of 21 offspring of hypertensive parents increased their creatinine clearance to values within 2 SD of the increase shown by the control group (preload, 144 +/- 11; 60 minutes, 153 +/- 7; 120 minutes, 202 +/- 13 ml/min/1.73 m2; p less than 0.001 vs. preload; 180 minutes, 214 +/- 19 ml/min/1.73 m2, p less than 0.001 vs. preload). The remaining eight offspring of hypertensive parents showed no detectable changes (nonresponders) (preload, 189 +/- 18; 60 minutes, 146 +/- 11; 120 minutes, 170 +/- 14; 180 minutes, 168 +/- 13 ml/min/1.73 m2; all values p = NS). No changes in atrial natriuretic factor after the protein load were observed in any group. Offspring of hypertensive parents presented higher microalbuminuria levels in 24-hour urine specimens (3.1 micrograms/min, tolerance factor [TF]2.2) than controls (2.1 micrograms/min, TF 1.5) (p less than 0.05). Although microalbuminuria increased significantly after the water load in the control group (p less than 0.05) and in the offspring of hypertensive parents (p less than 0.01), it returned to baseline at 120 minutes in the former but not in the latter (p less than 0.05 vs. baseline). The lack of renal functional reserve in nonresponders was significantly related (p less than 0.05) to the presence of higher levels of microalbuminuria. We conclude that the absence of renal functional reserve and increased microalbuminuria in some normotensive children who are offspring of essential hypertensive parents can indicate that subtle alterations in renal function may precede the onset of clinical hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the possible role of atrial natriuretic factor in right ventricular infarction, serial measurements of this hormone were performed in 21 patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction. All patients underwent enzymatic, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and coronary arteriographic studies. Ten patients also had right heart hemodynamic measurements. Eight patients had evidence of an associated right ventricular infarction (Group I) and 13 patients did not (Group II). Enzymatically estimated infarct size, presence of left heart failure and arrhythmias were similar in both groups. Mean arterial pressure in Group I (72.1 +/- 4.4 mm Hg) was significantly lower (p = 0.02) than in Group II (89.5 +/- 4.6 mm Hg). Seven (88%) of the eight patients in Group I had elevated right atrial pressures and a higher incidence than Group II of prolonged hypotension (75%) and right ventricular dysfunction (75%) clinically and by echocardiography. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels (mean values +/- SEM in pg/ml) for days 1, 2, 3 and 7 after infarction were, respectively: 152 +/- 30, 165 +/- 48, 199 +/- 27 and 189 +/- 31 for Group I versus 55 +/- 9, 55 +/- 11, 61 +/- 13 and 77 +/- 20 for Group II. The difference between groups was significant for days 1 (p less than 0.05), 3 and 7 (p less than 0.01) and not significant for day 2 (p = 0.07). These findings show that atrial natriuretic factor elevation is part of the neurohumoral response to right ventricular infarction and are consistent with the hypothesis that atrial natriuretic factor may play a pathophysiologic role in the right ventricular infarct syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to test the efficacy of nitroglycerin and diltiazem in inhibiting in vivo platelet aggregation and reducing platelet-mediated vasoconstriction in a canine model of coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury. Coronary artery diameter was measured in vivo by means of ultrasonic crystals sutured on the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) immediately distal to an external constrictor (LAD1), 1 cm below (LAD2), and on the left circumflex coronary artery. Coronary diameter was continuously measured before, during cyclic flow variations (progressive declines in blood flow followed by sudden restorations of flow due to recurrent intracoronary platelet aggregation), during cyclic flow variations and intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin (5 micrograms/kg per min) or diltiazem (15 micrograms/kg per min), and after cyclic flow variations were abolished by administration of LY53857, a serotonin receptor antagonist (n = 7), or SQ29548, a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist (n = 7). During control cyclic flow variations, at the nadir of coronary flow (6% to 11% of the nonstenosed values), LAD1 cross-sectional area decreased by 43 +/- 8% and 44 +/- 3% in the two groups of dogs subsequently treated with LY53857 and SQ29548, respectively. Neither nitroglycerin nor diltiazem caused changes in cyclic flow variation frequency or severity. Furthermore, neither drug significantly reduced the vasoconstriction associated with cyclic flow variations, whereas they significantly increased circumflex artery cross-sectional area. In contrast, LY53857 and SQ29548 were very effective in abolishing cyclic flow variations and the coronary vasoconstriction related to them. Five additional dogs received an intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerin (21 +/- 5 micrograms/kg per min) and later diltiazem (15 micrograms/kg per min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Heat-labile neutrophil chemotactic activity (HL NCA) has been investigated only after allergen inhalation challenge. In this study, we have measured HS NCA and HL NCA after exercise of 22 adult patients with asthma, 13 of whom had exercise-induced asthma (EIA). In the 13 patients, the effect of pharmacologic pretreatment on the generation of HS NCA and EIA was evaluated in a double-blind study with inhalation of either disodium cromoglycate, terbutaline, or budesonide 15 minutes before exercise. Additionally, the effect of 4 weeks of treatment with budesonide aerosol was evaluated in an open study. A significant increase (p less than 0.01) in HS NCA was found in the patients with EIA with peak activities 15 minutes after exercise. In patients without EIA, the activity of HS NCA was variable. No HL NCA was detectable after exercise. EIA was inhibited by disodium chromoglycate, terbutaline, and 4 weeks of treatment with budesonide. The generation of HS NCA was more or less inhibited by all three drugs with 4 weeks of treatment with budesonide as the most potent regimen. No late-phase asthmatic reactions to exercise were found. It is concluded that only HS NCA is generated after exercise of subjects with asthma and that this production is controlled by antiasthmatic drugs. However, the generation of HS NCA occurs irrespective of EIA.\r"

  ".W": "The T cell response to microbial T cell mitogens (MTM) such as enterotoxins from Staphylococcus aureus (SE) and the soluble mitogen from Mycoplasma arthritidis, resemble the minor lymphocyte stimulatory locus (Mls) response in several aspects. An important feature of the Mls response is it restriction to CD4+ cells. This study demonstrates that in contrast to Mls, the MTM response includes both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Both CD4+ and CD8+ cells expanded in IL-2 after stimulation with SEB showed preferential expression of T cell receptors bearing V beta 8 domains. Mouse and human target cells could be lysed in the presence of MTM both by MTM-stimulated CD8+ lymphocytes and by MHC class I-restricted CTL clones of defined Ag specificity. MTM-induced lysis required the expression of MHC class II, but not class I Ag, on the target cells. Inhibition studies of SEB and Ag-dependent cytolysis by CTL clones underlined the crucial role of CD3 and LFA-1 in both instances, but showed CD8 dependence only for AG-dependent cytolysis. Together these findings suggest important differences between the putative MTM-mediated interaction of TCR with MHC molecules and the classical TCR/MHC interaction involved in MHC-restricted Ag recognition.\r"

Spleen cells from six patients immunized with Haemophilus influenzae type b-diphtheria toxoid, pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines were T cell-depleted and separated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. In each B cell fraction, spontaneous antibody production was demonstrated to capsular polysaccharides as well as diphtheria toxoid. The peak of spontaneous antibody production was demonstrated to be five to seven days after immunization. When T cells and PWM were added, the total Ig secretion increased in all B cell fractions. PWM also enhanced IgG antibody directed to each of three polysaccharide Ag measured. This enhancement was most noticeable for nonresting B cells. The PWM effect was not confined to IgG, as IgM and IgA to Neisseria meningitidis type C were measured and also enhanced. The kinetics of the PWM response demonstrated the most IgG antibody to polysaccharide Ag from spleens immunized five to seven days before splenectomy. When the patients were immunized either 2 days or 4 mo before splenectomy, no spontaneous IgG antibody to polysaccharides was detected although PWM induced small amounts of antibody. Finally, anti-IL-6 antibody blocked PWM-induced total and polysaccharide-specific antibody production. We conclude that human polysaccharide-specific B cells are responsive to PWM and IL-6. We suggest that polysaccharide B cells are not truly \"T cell-independent\" and may respond to T cell lymphokines and thus are similar to protein-specific B cells.\r"

However, their functional role and phenotypic characterization have not yet been well documented. In this study we examined the surface phenotypes and functional properties of TCR-gamma delta+ cells from several patients with primary immunodeficiency syndrome. It was demonstrated that TCR-gamma delta+ cells detected by TCR-delta 1 mAb were increased in some of the patients, particularly in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and severe combined immune deficiency. The TCR-gamma delta+ cells showed such a unique profile that more than 60% of the cells expressed delta-TCS1, which is normally present in a lesser amount, and that most of the cells lacked CD5 T lineage marker. TCR-gamma delta+ cells from the patients with primary immunodeficiency syndrome served as NK cells as observed in normal individuals, while displaying weak LAK and allogeneic cell-specific killer activities. The TCR-gamma delta+ cells were classified into several subpopulations according to their antigenic phenotype, then their NK activity of normal individuals and patients, lymphokine-activated killer and allo-specific killer activities of normal individuals were compared among the subpopulations. Delta-TCS1+ cells mediated almost the same killer activities as total TCR-gamma delta+ cells, whereas CD8+ TCR-gamma delta+ cells displayed stronger cytotoxic activities in both normal subjects and the patients with primary immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

Thirty-two overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to the complete sequence of human AcChR alpha subunit were used to investigate the anti-alpha subunit response of unselected lymphocytes and of CD8(+)-depleted, CD4(+)-enriched lymphocytes from the blood of nine MG patients and from four healthy controls. One subject was a newly diagnosed MG patient that was tested three times after the development of the disease. An anti-AcChR response of the CD4(+)-enriched cells was present that could be detected only after removal of the CD8+ population and that seems to be related to the clinical conditions of the patient. The high basal rate of the cell proliferation of the unselected unstimulated blood lymphocytes and the normal basal rate observed for the CD8(+)-depleted population suggested the presence of activated CD8+ cells. The study of surface markers of the T cells confirmed the existence of activated CD8+ and CD4+ cells in numbers correlated with the severity of the disease and the results of the in vitro response of the T cells. The anti-AcChR activity of the CD4+ cells in MG may be a useful marker of the activity of the disease and it seems to be influenced by activated CD8+ cells present in the patients' blood.\r"

TGF-beta 1 alone induced differentiation of a human monocytic leukemia U-937 line into the cells with macrophage characteristics. When combined with TNF, TGF-beta 1 synergistically or additively induced differentiation associated properties. A human myeloblastic leukemia cell line, ML-1, differently responded to TGF-beta 1 in induction of differentiation. FcR activity and phagocytic activity induced by TNF were suppressed by TGF-beta 1. However, nitroblue tetrazolium reducing activity was synergistically induced by combinations of TGF-beta 1 and TNF. Scatchard analysis of TNF receptors indicated that the number of binding sites and dissociation constant of TNF for its receptors on U-937 or ML-1 cells were not changed by treatment with TGF-beta 1. Although IFN-gamma, IL-6, granulocyte CSF, and granulocyte-macrophage CSF-induced nitroblue tetrazolium reducing activity of U-937 cells, only IFN-gamma, and TNF induced it synergistically in combination with TGF-beta 1. Synergism between TGF-beta 1 and TNF was also observed in inhibition of growth of U-937 and ML-1 cells. Although TGF-beta 1 induction of differentiation of other monocytoid leukemic THP-1 cells was similar to that of U-937 cells, TGF-beta 1 only slightly induced differentiation of promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells, either alone or in combination with TNF. Our observations indicate that TGF-beta 1 strongly modulates differentiation and proliferation of human myelogenous leukemia cells, macrophage precursors.\r"

  ".U": "90154807\r", 
  ".W": "paf-Acether (paf) is a phospholipid mediator of inflammation released from monocytes along with IL-1. In this study, we have examined the role of paf on IL-1 production by human monocytes. When paf from 1 nM to 5 microM, but not its precursor lyso paf, was added to monocytes in the presence of muramyl dipeptide (MDP) or LPS, a marked increase in IL-1 activity over the value with MDP alone was observed. In contrast, paf alone had minimal activity over the same dose range. Antibodies against rHu IL-1 alpha and rHu IL-1 beta neutralized the increased IL-1 activity. Interestingly, MDP that prompts monocytes to synthesize IL-1, induced the synthesis of paf, as well. Most of the paf produced remained cell-associated and always preceded IL-1 synthesis. When the paf receptor antagonist, L-652,731 was added to monocytes, it prevented the enhancement of IL-1 activity induced by exogenous paf. In contrast, L-652,731 had little effect on MDP-induced IL-1 synthesis in the absence of exogenous paf. This may indicate that there are alternative mechanisms involved in the sequences of events leading to IL-1 production. It is also conceivable that the paf receptor antagonist is not able to compete or inhibit endogenous paf as well as it does for exogenous paf. Nevertheless, exogenous paf in association with a second signal, modulates IL-1 production from human monocytes in a positive manner. This may constitute another means through which paf can modulate inflammatory and immune reactions.\r"

Human and mouse monoclonal anti-Sm autoantibodies designated 4B4 and Y2 share an idiotype (Id) determinant located on the Ig H chain. To understand the molecular basis of this cross-reactivity, the VH regions of both antibodies were sequenced and analyzed for homology. The antibodies showed only 49.6% homology. The second complementary determining region (CDR2) was the most likely candidate for the Id site. To investigate this possibility, rabbit antiserum was made against a peptide corresponding to the CDR2 of 4B4. This antiserum was specific for the immunizing peptide and reacted weakly to a peptide corresponding to the CDR2 of Y2. Anti-CDR2 antibody bound to 4B4 and Y2 but not to other human and mouse mAb. Binding was directed at the H chain when analyzed by Western blots. Anti-CDR2 antibody blocked anti-Id antibody binding to 4B4 and Y2 by 58% and 24%, respectively. These studies suggest that this interspecies Id maps to the H chain CDR2 and that a conserved Id can occur within molecules that are otherwise radically different.\r"

This Id is encoded by a single gene segment combination: VHidcr11-DFL16.1e-JH2 for the H chain and Vkidcr-Jk1 for the L chain. In this report, we show that lethal irradiation of A/J mice followed by reconstitution with autologous or syngeneic lymphoid cells results in loss of major CRIA Id expression in the response to arsonate. Different protocols were performed to repopulate the irradiated mice. First, lethally irradiated A/J mice were reconstituted by the transfer of syngeneic bone marrow cells. Second, A/J mice were lethally irradiated while their hind limbs were partially shielded. Third, lethally irradiated A/J mice received a transfer of syngeneic spleen cells. The three groups of mice produce high titers of antiarsonate antibodies completely devoid of CRIA DH-JH related idiotopes expression. Moreover, a lack of affinity maturation is observed in the secondary antiarsonate response of all irradiated and reconstituted mice. A transfer of syngeneic peritoneal cells or a transfer of primed T cells in irradiated and reconstituted A/J mice do not restore in a significant manner either the recurrent CRIA expression or the affinity maturation of the antiarsonate response. Our data suggest that the choice of this Id is not solely dictated by the Igh locus.\r"

These findings demonstrate that transmembrane signaling pathways involving the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides by phospholipase C and D and of other phospholipids by phospholipase C and Az, and the rise in [Ca2+]i are not essential processes for triggering the ingestion of yeast particles opsonized with IgG and C3b/bi and the activation of the NADPH oxidase.\r"

  ".U": "90154818\r", 
  ".W": "The structurally related immunosuppressive macrolides FK-506 and rapamycin (RAP) were previously shown to inhibit T cell stimulation through different mechanisms. FK-506 acts similarly to cyclosporin A (CsA) and prevents IL-2 production and IL-2R expression. RAP has little or no effect on these events but markedly impedes the response to IL-2. The present study was initiated to examine the possibility of a complementation between the immunosuppressive actions of RAP and FK-506 or CsA on various murine T cell responses. RAP potentiated the effect of CsA on proliferation and IL-2R expression in T cells stimulated with ionomycin + PMA. However, in the same system, RAP acted as a potent antagonist of FK-506 suppression. RAP also blocked FK-506- but not CsA-mediated inhibition of IL-2 mRNA induction. By using model systems sensitive to inhibition by RAP but not FK-506 we further demonstrated that FK-506 reciprocally behaves as an antagonist of RAP. In one such model, the stimulation of splenic T cells with IL-2 + PMA, FK-506, but not CsA, reversed the suppressive effect of RAP on proliferation. FK-506 also antagonized RAP-mediated inhibition with respect to the induction of Ly-6E Ag expression by IFN in YAC cells. To explore further the competition between the two macrolides at the cellular level, we performed binding experiments with a radiolabeled derivative of FK-506. Both FK-506 and RAP, but not CsA, inhibited the binding of this probe in YAC cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that FK-506 and RAP antagonize each other's biologic activity and physically interact with a common receptor site(s) in T cells. Moreover, CsA acts at a site distinct from the cellular target(s) of FK-506 or RAP.\r"

  ".W": "Unstimulated human monocytes did not express appreciable levels of cytotoxicity on normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) in a 24-48 hr TdR release assay. On activation with IFN-gamma and LPS, monocytes had appreciable cytotoxicity on EC. Monocyte cytotoxicity on EC was not dependent on the presence of contaminating lymphoid cells. Recombinant TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 as well as monocyte supernatants did not exert a cytotoxic effect on EC. Moreover, anti-TNF, anti-IL-1, and anti-IL-6 antibodies, as well as scavengers of reactive oxygen intermediates, did not affect the cytotoxicity of activated monocytes on EC. Antibodies against the beta-chain (CD18) of leukocyte integrins inhibited the adhesion and cytotoxicity of activated monocytes on EC. Pretreatment of EC with IL-1 augmented the adhesion of monocytes on EC. Normal monocytes were not cytotoxic on IL-1-pretreated EC and IL-1 treatment did not increase the susceptibility of EC to activated monocytes. Thus adhesion is necessary but not sufficient for monocyte killing of EC. Anti-alpha L (LFA-1) antibodies markedly reduced monocyte cytotoxicity on EC, although anti-alpha X (p150) antibodies had only a modest effect. Anti-alpha M (Mac-1/CR3) antibodies were intermediate inhibitors of EC killing by activated monocytes. Thus, alpha L, beta 2 (LFA-1), and, to a lesser extent, alpha M, beta 2 (Mac-1/CR3) and alpha X, beta 2 (p 150, 95) integrins are the main adhesive structures involved in the cytotoxic interaction of activated monocytes with EC. Monocyte-mediated damage of EC could play a role as a mechanism of tissue injury under conditions of local or systemic activation of mononuclear phagocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of histamine H1 receptors on lymphocytes has been indirectly suggested by the various effects of agonists or antagonists on the functionally distinct T lymphocyte subsets. Recently, a new H1 antagonist, 125I-iodobolpyramine, whose structure is similar to mepyramine, has become available for the detection of H1 receptors in guinea pig brain. When using 125I-iodobolpyramine on human T lymphocytes, the presence of a single highly specific H1 binding site was evidenced. The binding of 125I-iodobolpyramine to human T cells was reversible when using 1000-fold excess of the cold H1 antagonist, d-chlorpheniramine. Binding saturation was achieved at 0.60-0.65 nM of 125I-iodobolpyramine, the binding equilibrium was reached in 20-30 min at 27 degrees C. The dissociation constant was KD = 0.41 +/- 0.07 (mean +/- SE) and the number of receptors per T cell was 3407 +/- 592 (mean +/- SE) as deduced from saturation and kinetic curves. In competition experiments using a panel of H1 ligands, the T cell binding sites detected by 125I-iodobolpyramine showed a pharmacological behavior characteristic of histamine H1 receptors. It was of particular interest that 125I-iodobolpyramine binding displayed clearcut stereoselectivity as assessed by the higher affinity of the d-configuration of chlorpheniramine than the l form. Study of purified CD4 and CD8 T cells showed that twice as much H1 histamine receptors were expressed by CD8 T lymphocytes (6615 +/- 1125) as compared to CD4 T cells (3545 +/- 459). These results underline the need for studying the functional properties of such pharmacologically defined T lymphocyte H1 binding sites.\r"

In this paper, we compared the macrophage growth-stimulating activity of cardiolipin (CL), an active phospholipid with that of CSF-1. Growth kinetics and maximal degree of growth of exudated macrophages induced by CL were similar to those of CSF-1. CL did not stimulate macrophages to release soluble macrophage growth factors. Also, the activity of CL was not blocked as much by anti-CSF-1, suggesting that most of the effect of CL was direct and not mediated by CSF-1 or other protein factors. There was no synergistic effect between CL and CSF-1. CL induced growth of both exudate and resident macrophages, whereas CSF-1 induced very little resident macrophage growth. Furthermore, although the growth-stimulating activities of both substances were inhibited by IFN-gamma and TNF, CL was more resistant to these inhibitory effects. These results suggest that the lipid has some different characters from CSF-1 and may induce the growth of resident macrophages in inflammations or tumors.\r"

It is also produced by intact, schistosome egg-induced granulomas isolated from the livers of such mice without additional antigenic exposure. The production of ESP activity is decreased during chronic infection in a time course coordinate with granuloma modulation. Characterization of ESP was pursued to determine its relationship to other cytokines and to identify factors that may play a role in granuloma formation and modulation. Chromatographic separations, assays of recombinant cytokines, and cytokine-specific immunodepletions were used in the characterization. ESP+ supernatant fluids contain both granulocyte-macrophage CSF and IL-5. The removal of both granulocyte-macrophage CSF and IL-5 is required to eliminate ESP activity, and together they act synergistically to constitute ESP.\r"

Mice were killed at intervals after infection and their sera were tested by enzyme immunoassay against a panel of self- and non-self-Ag: actin, myoglobin, myosin, tubulin, DNA, and TNP-OVA. The level of IgM and IgG autoantibodies against all Ag started to increase from day 15 until 6 wk after the parasite infection. The high level of all autoantibodies persisted 3 mo postinfection, and 1 yr later, half of the mice still had elevated levels of IgM and IgG autoantibodies, particularly antitubulin IgG antibodies. IgM and IgG were isolated from pools of normal and infected mouse sera and their binding capacity to all Ag was compared. The titers of infected mouse sera were increased and the slopes of both IgM and IgG binding curves of autoantibodies to actin, myosin, and tubulin were greater than those of control mouse sera, indicating higher affinities. The average dissociation constant of the IgG2a autoantibody to mouse tubulin was 5 times lower than that of natural antitubulin IgG2a antibodies. Furthermore, absorption of the IgG from infected mouse sera onto a tubulin immunoadsorbent removed half the reactivity with tubulin and also with myosin, actin and parasite extracts. The eluted antibodies bound the same Ag. When IgG were further analyzed by Western blot on proteolytic fragments of tubulin, we found that antibodies from both groups bound to the same broad spectrum of polypeptide bands. However, additional fragments were recognized by antibodies from infected mice. All these results indicate that the autoantibodies naturally present in mice are significantly affected after infection with T. cruzi, in quantity as well as in specificity and affinity.\r"

The P25 peak of electric SEPs was considerably enhanced but the P320 potential of pain SEPs was of normal amplitude in all patients. After medication, myoclonus was reduced and the amplitude of P25 was decreased, but P320 showed no change. In our previous study of the scalp distribution in normal subjects, a subcortical site, probably the thalamus, was considered to be the generator source of P320. Because most pain stimuli do not reach the cortex, patients with cortical reflex myoclonus are not sensitive to pain stimuli and P320 in pain SEPs is not enhanced.\r"

  ".W": "Whether hyperosmotic blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a technique that can be used to increase permeability of brain-tumor capillaries and thereby transiently increase drug delivery to the brain tumor is controversial. Nine virally induced brain tumors were studied in seven dogs, before and after hyperosmotic BBB disruption with 1.4 osmolar mannitol. Each dog was studied with computerized tomography (CT) after administration of the water-soluble tracer meglumine iothalamate. Each study lasted 30 minutes. A baseline CT scan and 35 to 40 additional CT scans were obtained to provide a time-related measurement of the amount of meglumine iothalamate in tissue (Am(t], and 30 plasma samples were collected to provide the time-related measurement of meglumine iothalamate in plasma (Cp(t]. The data were analyzed by three different methods: 1) a two-compartment model and nonlinear curve fitting were used to calculate K1 (blood-to-tissue or influx constant), k2 (tissue-to-blood or efflux constant), and Vp (plasma vascular space); 2) K1 values were calculated with a two-compartment model, assuming no efflux, at the time point for each CT scan; and 3) a \"tissue advantage ratio\" was calculated that expressed the ratio of tissue uptake of meglumine iothalamate at each time point, comparing values before and after BBB disruption. Regardless of which method of data analysis was used, there was a marked and significant increase in transcapillary transport of meglumine iothalamate to tumor-free brain regions, while there was only a small, transient, and insignificant increase to the brain tumors. Although there were often marked increases in delivery to cortex in the same hemisphere as the tumors, there was no significant increase to brain immediately surrounding the tumors, perhaps due to altered circulatory dynamics in this region. These data raise serious questions as to the wisdom of using this technique to increase drug delivery to brain tumors in patients and strongly support the continued study of this technique in experimental brain tumors before it is used in patients.\r"

The effect of pretreatment with naloxone on these activities was also evaluated in the same model. After MCA occlusion, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was promptly reduced in the ischemic hemisphere and remained at a lower level than in the contralateral hemisphere during 90 minutes of ischemia. A single intraperitoneal 0.5-mg injection of naloxone prior to MCA occlusion attenuated the inactivation. On the other hand, beta-endorphin immunoreactivity was significantly increased following ischemia. The increase was marked in the ischemic hemisphere and was also observed in the contralateral hemisphere; this increase was not affected by the administration of naloxone. These results indicate the possibility that naloxone contributes to protecting the brain from ischemia through stabilizing the cellular membrane. The possible mechanism by which naloxone attenuates the inactivation of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in the ischemic brain is discussed in view of alterations of the central beta-endorphin system during ischemia.\r"

During the period of cerebral development there is a linear relationship between the n-3 fatty acid content of the brain and that of food until alpha-linolenic acid represents approximately 200 mg/100 g food [0.4% of the total dietary energy for 18:3(n-3)]. Beyond that point brain levels reach a plateau. Similar values are also found for other organs. The level of 22:6(n-3) in membranes is little affected by the dietary quantity of linoleic acid [18:2(n-6)] if 18:3(n-3) represents approximately 0.4% of energy. In membranes from rats fed diets containing sunflower oil, Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity in nerve terminals was 60%, 5'-nucleotidase in whole brain homogenate was 80%, and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase was 88% of that in membranes from rats fed diets containing soybean oil. A diet low in alpha-linolenic acid leads to anomalies in the electroretinogram, which partially disappear with age. It has little effect on motor activity, but it seriously affects learning tasks as measured with the shuttle box test. Rats fed a diet low in alpha-linolenic acid showed an earlier mortality in response to an intraperitoneal injection of a neurotoxin, triethyltin, than did rats fed a normal soybean oil diet.\r"

However, circulating carnitine levels of strict vegetarian adults and children, and particularly of infants fed carnitine-free formulas, are significantly lower than normal. Therefore, we investigated loci at which rates of carnitine synthesis may be restricted in human adults. Excess amounts of the carnitine precursors lysine plus methionine, epsilon-N-trimethyllysine or gamma-butyrobetaine were fed as supplements to a low carnitine diet for 10 d. Rate of carnitine synthesis was estimated by changes in carnitine excretion and changes in serum and muscle carnitine levels. Dietary gamma-butyrobetaine dramatically increased carnitine production, epsilon-N-trimethyllysine had a somewhat smaller effect, and lysine plus methionine had even less effect on carnitine synthesis. We conclude that carnitine synthesis is not limited by the activity of gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase. Carnitine synthesis from exogenous epsilon-N-trimethyllysine is limited either by enzymatic processes that lead to the final intermediate, gamma-butyrobetaine, or by the ability of this substrate to enter tissues capable of carrying out these transformations.\r"

Presumably, the fatty acid constituents of these dietary oils exert their effects by altering the levels of cutaneous eicosanoids. Prompted by this possibility, we investigated whether supplementation of guinea pig diets with fish oil [rich in 20:5(n-3)] or borage oil [rich in 18:3(n-6)] could significantly alter epidermal levels of eicosanoids compared with control animals supplemented with olive oil. After feeding periods of 4, 8 or 12 wk, the epidermis from the animals was analyzed for: 1) fatty acid composition of individual epidermal phospholipids, 2) levels of lipoxygenase products, and 3) levels of cyclooxygenase products (prostaglandins). Our results demonstrated that the animals supplemented with dietary fish oil had elevated levels of 20:5(n-3) in epidermal phospholipids and elevated epidermal levels of 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE) [the 15-lipoxygenase product of 20:5(n-3)] compared with guinea pigs fed olive oil or borage oil. Similarly, the animals supplemented with dietary borage oil had elevated levels of 20:3(n-6) [the epidermal elongase product of 18:3(n-6)] in epidermal phospholipids and elevated epidermal levels of 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid [15-HETrE, the epidermal 15-lipoxygenase product of 20:3(n-6)] compared with guinea pigs fed olive oil or fish body oil. There were no significant changes in epidermal levels of prostaglandins. Both 15-HEPE and 15-HETrE have been identified as possible anti-inflammatory metabolites, and their elevated presence in the epidermis of animals fed oils rich in 20:5(n-3) or 18:3(n-6) may provide a mechanism for the beneficial effects of these oils on inflammatory conditions.\r"

  ".W": "HIV-1 neutralizing activity was demonstrated in serum and 200-fold concentrated urine from individuals who were HIV-1 antibody positive in both their serum and urine, including AIDS-KS, AIDS-OI, ARC, and asymptomatic patients. Virus neutralization activity was detected in 23 of 56 (41.1%) of the serum samples and in 19 of 56 (33.9%) of the urine samples tested, with titers ranging from 1:8 to 1:256 and 1:1 to 1:4, respectively. The highest frequency of HIV-1 neutralizing activity (87.5%) and the highest mean neutralization titers (1:65) were found in the ARC patients. A high prevalence of p24 antigen in serum and low numbers of T4-lymphocytes correlated with a low frequency of neutralizing activity in either serum or urine in the infected individuals. HIV-1 neutralizing activity in the urine was shown to be due to immunoglobulins using a Sephadex G-100 filtration gel. All 19 urine samples with neutralizing activity contained antibodies reactive with envelope glycoproteins gp160, gp120, and gp41 by Western blot, similar to that seen with serum. The frequency of HIV-1 neutralizing activity in the urine concentrates was generally associated with high titers of neutralizing antibody in the corresponding serum. These findings suggest that HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies are lost in the urine by an as yet unknown mechanism.\r"

Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage kill invading bacterial pathogens and subsequently release immunoadjuvant components from the degraded cell walls.

Synthetic muramyl peptide, mycobacterial trehalose dimycolate, and detoxified endotoxin exhibited an initial reduction followed by a rapid increase in HIV p24 antigen production. The upregulation of virus expression was correlated with enhanced interleukin-1 beta levels and a decrease in TNF-alpha production.\r"

This production was abrogated by prior incubation of the phenotypic mixtures with antiserum against VSV or HSV, as well as by incubation of the mixtures at 39 degrees C for 10 h. These results demonstrate that during coinfection of cells with either a RNA or DNA virus, HIV forms hybrid virions composed of the genetic information of HIV and the envelope glycoproteins of the coinfecting viruses.\r"

Here, we present evidence of active HIV infection, i.e., infected and not merely sensitized following factor VIII injections. Six Canadians with hemophilia had seroconverted during a longitudinal study of their HIV immune status. Two of the three patients tested by this method demonstrated HIV gag-specific sequences upon amplification by polymerase chain reaction. In addition, HIV-1 virus was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of one of these two persons as shown by reverse transcriptase activity of culture supernatants as well as neutralizable p24 antigen. This, we believe, is the first evidence of active HIV infection following administration of 60 degrees C, 30 h heat-treated factor VIII.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the usefulness of intrauterine insemination in women with various fertility factors, we retrospectively analyzed data from women treated during 1986 and 1987. Ninety-three patients underwent 1-11 cycles of single or double procedures, for a total of 423 inseminations in 263 treatment cycles. Twenty-six patients (28%) conceived, for a 10% total pregnancy rate per cycle, with 58% of the pregnancies resulting from double inseminations per cycle. An average of two treatment cycles was required to achieve pregnancy. Eight pregnancies (31%) occurred in spontaneous cycles, while 18 (69%) occurred in stimulated cycles. While clomiphene citrate therapy was useful in anovulatory patients, it was of no benefit in ovulatory patients being treated with intrauterine insemination. Human menopausal gonadotropin therapy was of benefit in both ovulatory and anovulatory patients when combined with intrauterine insemination. The live birth rate was higher (75%) in spontaneous cycles than in stimulated cycles (44%). Semen preparation was accomplished by sperm washing in 61% of the pregnancies and by Percoll preparation in 39%. The effectiveness of the discontinuous Percoll gradient for semen preparation for insemination was suggested by a pregnancy rate of 9% per cycle. While the mean sperm count in the pregnant group was 44 million, successful pregnancy was accomplished with a double insemination of 880,000 and 1.16 million rapidly progressive sperm in the first and second inseminate, respectively. The data confirm the important role of intrauterine insemination for the treatment of infertility.\r"

Follicular development was stimulated with either clomiphene citrate (CC) or human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). Thirty-one pregnancies were induced; 23 went to term. Three factors were considered in evaluating the incidence of conception: the patient's age, drug use and the presence or absence of POUS. There was no evidence that the pregnancy rate after POUS differed from that without it (estimated conception rate ratio = 1.2:1, P = .76). Similarly, conceptus viability was not demonstrably different whether POUS was used or not (P = 1.00). However, the data show a strong advantage of hMG over CC in achieving conception (estimated conception rate ratio = 5.85, P less than .0001) and no disadvantage in conceptus viability (P = 1.00). The data also suggest that in women less than 30 years of age with polycystic ovaries, ovulation induction is easier to achieve and the conception rate higher than in older women. There was no evidence that POUS decreased the conception rate or increased fetal wastage.\r"

  ".W": "Gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) is a 27 amino acid hormone that elicits a variety of biological effects. Receptor-binding antagonists of GRP may have therapeutic use in several pathologic conditions including cancer. The identification and characterization of GRP receptor antagonists have been aided by the use of murine 3T3 cells that possess functional GRP receptors. However, no human or primate cell lines that possess high-density GRP receptors and exhibit a biochemical or biological response to GRP have been described. To address this problem, we examined a series of cell lines and found that GRP specifically binds to Cos-7 monkey cells and stimulates elevation of intracellular calcium in these cells. Cos-7 cells exhibit a single class of high-affinity (dissociation constant = 0.13 nM) GRP binding sites (35,000/cell). Cross-linking experiments that use radiolabeled GRP identified two species of putative GRP receptor proteins (relative molecular mass, 90,000 and 22,000). Competitive binding inhibition studies indicate that Cos-7 cells tightly bind GRP-specific receptor antagonists. These antagonists block the binding of radiolabeled GRP to Cos-7 cells and inhibit GRP-stimulated elevation of intracellular calcium. These properties make Cos-7 cells a useful reagent for the study of GRP receptor antagonists.\r"

  ".U": "90156451\r", 
  ".W": "In the \"flow\" phase of severe injury, mobilization of body fat and protein sources are accelerated to meet increased demands. Fat mobilization usually exceeds the need for oxidative substrates and the leftover fatty acids are re-esterified, resulting in a \"futile\" TG/FFA cycle. This contributes to increased energy expenditure and provision of nutrients may alter the activity of this cycle. We measured in nine adult (age 40 +/- 7 years, weight, 80 +/- 4 kg) severely traumatized (ISS 32 +/- 4) patients, the resting energy expenditure (REE) and net fat oxidation rate (NFO) by indirect calorimetry and whole body lipolysis rate (WBLR) by a two-stage, primed-constant infusion of glycerol. Fasting postinjury kinetic studies were performed within 48-96 hours after admission when the patients were receiving saline without calories or nitrogen. Glucose-based nutritional therapy was then started and continued for 5 to 7 days. The kinetic measurements were repeated after the nutritive solutions were replaced by normal saline for 12 to 15 hours to achieve a postabsorptive state. Trauma elicits an accelerated rate of fat mobilization with increased TG/FFA cycle activity. Adequate nutritional support for 5 to 7 days tends to reduce but cannot normalize the lipid metabolism. In acute trauma 47 +/- 7% of the mobilized fat was recycled to triglyceride and this is increased to 54 +/- 9% after providing nutrition. The energy cost of this cycling was 38 kcal/day, which is five times that seen in normals and corresponds to 1.34% REE.\r"

Of 202 enrolled patients 176 currently are evaluable with a mean follow-up of 3 years (range 3 to 97 months). The number of patients with recurrences was significantly lower in the bacillus Calmette-Guerin arm (9 of 67) compared to the doxorubicin (23 of 53, p equals 0.002) and thiotepa (20 of 56, p equals 0.003) arms. The over-all recurrence index per 100 patient-months also was lower for the bacillus Calmette-Guerin versus the thiotepa and doxorubicin groups (0.53 versus 1.55 and 1.7, respectively). Bacillus Calmette-Guerin also was superior in preventing recurrences and progression of high risk tumors, that is stage T1, grade 3 or multiple growths, associated or not with carcinoma in situ. In the stage T1 category 19 of 32 (60%) tumors recurred under treatment with doxorubicin, 11 of 33 (33%) with thiotepa and 6 of 49 (12%) with bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Toxicity to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin was higher compared to the other drugs but it was not limiting: bladder irritability and malaise occurred in 42% of the patients, granulomatous cystitis in 16.4% and bladder contraction in 1.4% (1 of 64). The latter complication occurred in a patient whose stage T1m grade 2 tumors had recurred 3 times, who underwent 3 transurethral bladder resections within 15 months and who had received thiotepa for 4 months after having been removed from the study 11 months after entry. Three patients in the doxorubicin group (5.6%) underwent radical cystectomy for local urothelial progression. One patient (1.8%) in the same group died of distant progression. Our preliminary results suggest that at the dose, periodicity and duration used in the study bacillus Calmette-Guerin is significantly superior to the chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin and thiotepa for the prophylaxis of recurrence and retardation of progression in superficial transitional cell bladder tumors.\r"

The extracellular glycosaminoglycans (GAG) were assayed to determine whether these polyanionic macromolecules are responsible for the increased water content of the gubernaculum. The total GAG/wet tissue mass in the gubernaculum decreased during and increased after descent, while the total GAG/dry mass decreased during and after descent, indicating an accumulation of water during descent, with a loss of water and an increase in less hydrated tissue components after descent. The major GAG fraction in the gubernaculum was dermatan sulfate, but the percentage hyaluronate in the gubernaculum was two times higher than in striated muscle or umbilical cord, indicating that this GAG fraction may be responsible for the increased water content of the gubernaculum, which probably serves to dilate the inguinal canal and scrotum, thus facilitating descent.\r"

The S-100 stain is positive in about 60% of cases. In the current series, most tumors arose in deep dermis and were grade 2 malignant lesions with a moderate degree of cytologic atypia and 2 or fewer mitoses in 10 high-power fields. Three patients died of their malignant lesion. Only two tumors metastasized. Of the 10 patients who had local recurrence, 5 had multiple recurrent lesions. Neurofibrosarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of malignant tumors of the skin. A complete surgical resection of the primary tumor with adequate margins of surrounding normal-appearing tissue is advised.\r"

An integrated approach necessitates attention to conditions that might be aggravating angina, such as anemia or hypertension. Alterations in life-style and personal habits, such as cessation of cigarette smoking, are often necessary and should be continually reinforced by the physician. Certain concomitant diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, may influence the selection of drug therapy. Nitrates, beta-adrenergic blockers, and calcium entry blockers are the major classes of drugs that can be used alone or in combination in a program that is designed for the individual patient.\r"

  ".U": "90158797\r", 
  ".W": "A universal feature of integral transmembrane proteins is a hydrophobic peptide segment that spans the lipid bilayer. These hydrophobic domains are important for terminating the translocation of the polypeptide chain across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (a process termed stop transfer) and for integrating the protein into the bilayer. But a role for extracytoplasmic sequences in stop transfer and transmembrane integration has not previously been shown. Recently, a sequence which directs an unusual mode of stop transfer has been identified in the prion protein. This brain glycoprotein exists in two isoforms, which are identical both in primary amino-acid sequence and in containing phosphatidylinositol glycolipid linkages at their C termini, which can be cleaved by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C9. But only one of the isoforms (PrPC) is released from cells on treatment with this phospholipase, indicating that the two isoforms have either different subcellular locations or transmembrane orientations. Consistent with this is the observation of two different topological forms in cell-free systems. An unusual topogenic sequence in the prion protein seems to direct these alternative topologies (manuscript in preparation). In the wheat-germ translation system, this sequence directs nascent chains to a transmembrane orientation; by contrast, in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, this sequence fails to cause stop transfer of most nascent chains. We have now investigated determinants in this unusual topogenic sequence that direct transmembrane topology, and have demonstrated that (1) a luminally disposed charged domain is required for stop transfer at the adjacent hydrophobic domain, (2) a precise spatial relationship between these domains is essential for efficient stop transfer, and (3) codons encompassing this hydrophilic extracytoplasmic domain confer transmembrane topology to a heterologous protein when engineered adjacent to the codons for a normally translocated hydrophobic domain. These results identify an unexpected functional domain for stop transfer in the prion protein and have implications for the mechanism of membrane protein biogenesis.\r"

They express a TCR consisting of one particular V gamma 5 and one particular V delta 1 chain and seem to originate from early fetal thymocytes. We have now systematically analysed many tissues by immunohistochemistry and TCR gene sequencing aided by the polymerase chain reaction. These studies revealed a second homogeneous gamma delta T-cell subset in epithelia not of the intestine and skin, but of the vagina, uterus and tongue. The TCR expressed by this gamma delta T-cell subset consists of the same V delta 1 chain. Cells that express this particular TCR have previously been shown to be positively selected in the late fetal thymus.\r"

We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the human enzyme, a single-chain glycoprotein of 449 amino acids, by X-ray crystallography and established its primary structure by sequencing complementary DNA clones. Enzymatic activity is lost after chemical modification of Ser 152 in the porcine enzyme, indicating that this residue is essential in catalysis, but other data are more consistent with a function in interfacial recognition. Our structural results are evidence that Ser 152 is the nucleophilic residue essential for catalysis. It is located in the larger N-terminal domain at the C-terminal edge of a doubly wound parallel beta-sheet and is part of an Asp-His-Ser triad, which is chemically analogous to, but structurally different from, that in the serine proteases. This putative hydrolytic site is covered by a surface loop and is therefore inaccessible to solvent. Interfacial activation, a characteristic property of lipolytic enzymes acting on water-insoluble substrates at water-lipid interfaces, probably involves a reorientation of this flap, not only in pancreatic lipases but also in the homologous hepatic and lipoprotein lipases.\r"

  ".W": "Cytogenetic analysis has identified chromosome 11p13 as the smallest overlap region for deletions found in individuals with WAGR syndrome, which includes Wilms tumour (a recessive childhood nephroblastoma), aniridia, genito-urinary abnormalities and mental retardation. The underlying loci have since been resolved into an aniridia (AN2) locus at a telomeric position, and a locus of closely spaced genes or a single pleiotropic gene involved in genito-urinary tract abnormalities and Wilms tumour at a more centromeric position. Pulsed-field gel analysis of the 11p13 region has revealed the presence of several putative CpG islands, structures which are frequently associated with the 5' ends of expressed sequences, mainly housekeeping genes and some tissue-specific genes. Starting from a CpG island, we have now isolated four neighbouring CpG islands, all within 650 kilobases (kb), by means of two consecutive bidirectional jumps in rare-cutting restriction-enzyme jumping libraries. In two instances, flanking sequences were conserved in other species and RNA transcripts were identified. A complementary DNA clone isolated for one of them derives from an RNA highly expressed in fetal kidney, and is predicted to encode a Kruppel-like zinc-finger protein that is probably a transcription factor. The entire cDNA region is included in two partially overlapping homozygous deletions found in Wilms tumour DNA samples. Cloning of the breakpoints in one tumour revealed a deletion size of 170 kb, one-third of which is covered by the cDNA. The expression pattern and sequence of this cDNA could point to an important role for its corresponding gene in the normal development of the renal system as well as in Wilms tumour.\r"

  ".W": "The skin of mice contains dendritic epidermal cells carrying the Thy-1 antigen (Thy-1+ dEC) which express antigen receptors composed of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) gamma- and delta-chains. Although the role of the thymus in the generation of most T cells is well established, the involvement of the thymus in the generation of Thy-1+ dEC is not clear. Because bone marrow cells can give rise in Thy-1+ dEC in chimaeric mice and Thy-1+ dEC are detected in the skin of athymic nude nice, it has been proposed that Thy-1+ dEC arise continuously from bone marrow precursors by a thymus-independent mechanism. But it has recently been determined that Thy-1+ dEC in nude mice do not express TCR at the cell surface, and that the gamma- and delta-chain genes are in germ-line configuration, leaving the role of the thymus in the generation of Thy-1+ dEC uncertain. Most Thy-1+ dEC in all normal mouse strains examined express TCR containing the V gamma 3 gene product. This V gene segment is expressed on the first wave of TCR-expressing cells to emerge during fetal development, and in adult mice is detectable only on cells in the epidermis. In addition to use of this 'fetal' V gamma segment, other features of the Thy-1+ dEC TCR genes, including absence or minimal presence of nongerm-line-encoded nucleotides at the junctions and use of a single D element in the rearranged delta-chain gene are typical of rearrangements found in fetal, and not adult, thymus. Here we demonstrate that precursors that are present only in the fetal thymus give rise to Thy-1+ dEC in the skin of adult mice.\r"

We investigated the effect of pregnancy on autoantibody production prospectively and longitudinally. Forty-three healthy pregnant women were compared with 50 nonpregnant healthy controls matched for age, race, and various obstetric and medical indices. All sera were tested for total immunoglobulin (Ig) levels; IgG, IgM, and IgA isotypes of autoantibodies to six phospholipids; total histone and four histone subfractions; and four polynucleotides. Plasma samples were evaluated for the presence of lupus anticoagulant. Total IgG decreased significantly in pregnant patients. The majority of autoantibody levels in pregnant women were within normal nonpregnant ranges. Only a few autoantibodies were increased in early pregnancy, including IgG antiphosphatidylinositol and H 2B, IgM antiphosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid, and IgA antiphosphatidylinositol and H 4. Most autoantibodies, although increased at term, were still within the normal nonpregnant range. Normalizing the data for expanded plasma volume did not significantly alter these results. Adjustment regression analysis excluded age, race, and various medical and obstetric indicators as confounding variables for autoantibody levels. The expected and observed prevalence of positive autoantibody levels in pregnant women was not significantly different from that of nonpregnant controls. None of the pregnant women demonstrated positive lupus anticoagulant. We conclude that in normal pregnancy between 16 weeks' gestation and term, autoantibody levels are largely within the normal range. Alterations occur, if at all, at the time of delivery.\r"

Patients were studied daily, starting on day 10, until sonographic verification of ovulation. Each woman had serum estradiol (E2) and LH measured daily and progesterone measured only 7 days after ovulation. In addition, the ovaries were imaged transvaginally daily and the two largest follicular diameters, volumes, cross-sectional areas, and circumferences were measured in all follicles 10 mm or larger in diameter. Ultrasonographic measurements of follicles from clomiphene-stimulated cycles were significantly larger than those from spontaneous, GnRH-, and human menopausal gonadotropins-stimulated cycles (P less than .05). Serum E2 and progesterone secretion in human menopausal gonadotropins- and clomiphene-stimulated cycles were significantly higher than in spontaneous and GnRH-stimulated cycles (P less than .01). Women treated with human menopausal gonadotropins developed significantly more follicles than with any other treatment (P less than .05). Correlation analysis indicated that biophysical variables alone (follicular diameter, volume, cross-sectional area, or circumference) were good indicators of normal follicular development and predicted the mid-cycle LH surge in spontaneous (r = 0.81, P less than .001), GnRH- (r = 0.78, P less than .001), and clomiphene citrate-stimulated cycles (r = 0.83, P less than .001). However, in human menopausal gonadotropins-stimulated cycles, both serum E2 levels and ultrasonographic evaluation were necessary to decide the best time for hCG administration (r = 0.55, P less than .001).\r"

Similar cases will continue to raise arguments against conservative hormonal intervention in the perimenopausal woman with an enlarged uterus. As the gynecologist gains familiarity with the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue therapy in the treatment of myomatous uteri, the criteria for hysterectomy will become less rigid and the potential for delay in the diagnosis and treatment of sarcomatous disease will become more common. Physicians must be cognizant of this potential complication of conservative therapy of leiomyomata uteri.\r"

However, medical treatment has been reported using danazol, progestins, and estrogen-progestin combinations, although solid documentation of the effect of hormonal therapy against ureteral endometriosis is lacking. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist treatment of endometriosis has yielded good results but has not been adequately reported in patients with ureteric involvement. We report three patients treated with a GnRH agonist, leuprolide acetate, for 6-9 months as a preoperative course. One patient had bilateral and two had unilateral obstruction. The preoperative course relieved the obstruction in the patient with bilateral disease and in one with unilateral changes. The failure occurred in a patient with intrinsic ureteric endometriosis. This early experience suggests a place for GnRH agonist therapy for patients with ureteric obstruction due to endometriosis, probably, but not necessarily, in conjunction with a planned surgical procedure. If medical therapy is attempted, close surveillance of renal function is mandatory.\r"

Amplitude and implicit time measures of the ERG recordings obtained from six autosomal recessive and three autosomal dominant tyrosinase-positive albinos fell within the normal range. The six tyrosinase-negative albinos examined also had normal ERGs at low-to-moderate flash luminances. However, at the highest flash luminances, the dark-adapted ERGs of five such subjects were at or just above the normal range in amplitude, and were shorter than normal in implicit time. The dark-adapted luminance-response functions of these subjects were positioned normally on the luminance axis; light-adapted functions were shifted slightly to the left of normal. The possibility that anterior parts of the retina responding to light passing through the anterior eyewall may contribute to the ERGs obtained from tyrosinase-negative albinos was examined by recording dark-adapted ERGs with the sclera occluded. Amplitudes were reduced compared with those obtained with the sclera unoccluded, suggesting that responses to transscleral illumination contributed to the ERG in this type of albinism.\r"

  ".W": "Findings of the presence of lymphatics in the subepithelial connective tissue layer of the true vocal cord range from the statement that lymphatics are absent to the observation that a dense lymphatic network exists. This is undoubtedly a result of the different methods of examination. The entire extent of a lymphatic system can be shown by either an enzyme histochemical demonstration of the 5'-nucleotidase activity in the lymphatics, or electron microscopy, which is more elaborate. These two methods are used to describe a subepithelial lymphatic network of varying density in 80 human vocal folds, which--contrary a frequent assumption--is not interrupted in the area of the free margin of the true vocal cord. Under the squamous epithelium, the density of the lymphatic system, which is very high in the arytenoid region, decreases continuously toward the anterior portion of the true vocal cord. It is exactly in the region in which the lymphatic system is the sparsest that almost all cancers of the true vocal cord develop. This finding is highly significant, in view of the low incidence of lymphogenous metastasis formation in T1-glottic cancers.\r"

The growth inhibitory effects of methotrexate and the new folate analog 10-ethyl, 10-deazaaminopterin were compared in three in vitro-cultured human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. The inhibitory concentrations of the new analog were 10- to 100-fold lower than the inhibitory concentrations of methotrexate. The sensitivity of these three head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines to both drugs was essentially the same as the sensitivity of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line known to be very sensitive to methotrexate when the cell line is grown as a xenograft in athymic nude mice. These data indicate that 10-ethyl, 10-deazaaminopterin may be a new and effective agent against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

Experience with facial nerve disorders including Bell's palsy, facial nerve neuromas, a facial nerve graft site, postoperative facial paralysis, and traumatic facial paralysis is presented. The ability to image the facial nerve in Bell's palsy provides an entirely new means of examining this disorder, and its implications are discussed. The ability to enhance the paralyzed facial nerve in the temporal bone after posterior fossa surgery supports a previously held concept as to the pathophysiology of this problem.\r"

The identification and isolation of the internal carotid artery throughout its petrous course is essential in most of these surgical techniques. Anatomic landmarks normally used to identify this vital structure, however, may be severely distorted by tumor involvement or previous operative dissection. In an effort to define surgical landmarks that may be used in the identification of the petrous carotid artery, histologic sections of 100 temporal bones from adults were examined and microscopic measurements were recorded from the anatomic dissection of 10 fresh cadaver halfheads. On the basis of these studies, structures we have found useful in identification of the vertical petrous carotid artery during lateral skull base approaches include the: base of the styloid process, bony vascular crest, basal turn of the cochlea, medial wall of the eustachian tube, and the cochleariform process. Identification of the horizontal segment can be achieved by the preliminary delineation of the middle meningeal artery, greater petrosal nerve, tensor tympani muscle, mandibular and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve, and the eustachian tube. Specific anatomic relationships with associated measurements are detailed and correlated with selected, illustrative cases.\r"

That report prompted the present study, which was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of this test in differentiating patients who have head and neck malignancy from normal controls. Forty-six patients who had a biopsy-proven malignancy of the head and neck and 32 healthy individuals provided plasma for which the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum was plotted, blind to patient diagnosis or group. The average line-width of methyl and methylene resonance was calculated. Significant differences (p less than 0.05) were found between the group with disease and the group with no disease for the methyl line-widths, using analysis of variance. In spite of this statistical difference, plotting of the values for the methyl, methylene, and average line-widths clearly demonstrated that these three oncolipid measures have no clinical use because of the tremendous overlap between the disease and nondisease groups. The findings of this study do not support the use of water-suppressed proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a clinically useful test for the diagnosis of head and neck malignancy.\r"

Cranially based, 3 x 9 cm dorsal skin flaps were raised in 60 adult rats. All animals received either intramuscular methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) or an equal volume of intramuscular saline solution placebo 24 hours and 1 hour before, and 24 hours and 48 hours after, flap elevation. Treatment for animals receiving HBO was begun within 5 hours after flap elevation. The regimen consisted of two 90-minute treatments of 100% oxygen at 2.4 atm separated by 5-hour intervals or room air per day for 3 consecutive days. The 60 rats were divided equally into four treatment groups, as follows: group A, flap elevation alone (control); group B, flap plus steroids; group C, flap plus HBO; and group D, flap plus steroids plus HBO. Surviving flap length was measured by visual inspection 7 days after flap elevation. The mean surviving flap length for group A was 4.9 cm, for group B it was 6.4 cm, for group C it was 6.7 cm, and for group D it was 6.5 cm. The approximately 30% to 36% improvement in surviving flap length was highly statistically significant (p less than 0.006) when compared with controls. However, no statistically significant difference was found between the three treatment modalities. These findings indicate that in a rat dorsal skin flap model, perioperative steroids improve skin flap viability, and that steroids alone are as efficacious as HBO and as steroids combined with HBO.\r"

The compound action potential of the auditory nerve, cochlear microphonics, and the summating potential evoked by 10 kHz tone bursts of varying intensities were recorded from a wire inserted in the basal turn scala vestibuli. The endocochlear potential was recorded from the scala media. Sodium salicylate (1.25 to 10 mmol/L) reduced the magnitude of the compound action potential evoked by low-sound intensities without affecting the compound action potential evoked by high-sound intensities. Sodium salicylate also reduced cochlear microphonics and had no effect on summating potential. Cochlear perfusions of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, mefenamate (200 mumol/L), and meclofenamate (200 mumol/L), had no effect on the cochlear potentials. Quinine (10 to 100 mumol/L) reduced the compound action potential input-output function in a parallel fashion rather than selectively affecting the low-intensity compound action potential. Quinine (100 mumol/L) reduced cochlear microphonics and summating potential. Neither quinine (100 mumol/L) nor salicylate (5 mmol/L) affected endocochlear potential. These results suggest that salicylate-induced hearing loss is not caused by either antagonism of the hair cell transmitter or cyclooxygenase inhibition, nor is it caused by the same mechanism that causes quinine-induced hearing loss.\r"

In the model, estimates of test sensitivity and specificity, disease prevalence, treatment rates after positive test results, rates of complications for treated and untreated patient-cases, rates of antibiotic-induced complications, treatment effectiveness, and direct dollar costs of diagnosis and therapy were used. Results were expressed in terms of severe penicillin reactions per disease case prevented and dollars per complication prevented. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of changes in parameter estimates on model outcomes. With treat all, 90% of streptococcal complications were prevented and there were low short-term direct dollar costs. However, treat all is associated with a high rate of penicillin allergy (70% of which occurs in uninfected children) and is the least cost-effective strategy when the costs of treating complications are included. The marginal cost of antigen test + culture is less than the cost of either one-test strategy. Antigen test + culture is the most cost-effective strategy when the costs of managing the complications of streptococcal infection are considered. Antigen test + culture is the most clinically effective strategy, and its benefits are obtained at a modest marginal cost relative to the one-test strategy.\r"

Activation and autophosphorylation of all four enzymes were stringently dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin, indicating that neither Arg-283 nor Thr-286 is an absolute requirement for the pseudosubstrate inhibition of the enzyme. Autophosphorylation of the Ile-283 or Ala-286 enzyme generated little, if any, Ca2+/calmodulin-independent kinase activity, unlike the parent (Thr-286) or Ser-286 enzyme. The enzymes expressed in bacteria are predominantly monomeric, indicating that the generation of Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity does not require the cooperative interactions of subunits normally present in the brain holoenzyme.\r"

These origins comprise a second class of bacterial origins distinct from enteric-type origins: both origins function in both Pseudomonas species, and neither functions in Escherichia coli; enteric origins do not function in either pseudomonad. Both cloned sequences hybridize to chromosomal fragments that show properties expected of replication origins. These origin plasmids are highly unstable, are present at low copy number, and show mutual incompatibility properties. DNA sequence analysis shows that both origins contain several 9-base-pair (bp) E. coli DnaA protein binding sites; four of these are conserved in position and orientation, two of which resemble the R1 and R4 sites of the E. coli origin. Conserved 13-bp direct repeats adjacent to the analogous R1 site are also found. No GATC sites are in the P. aeruginosa origin and only four are in the P. putida origin; no other 4-bp sequence is present in high abundance. Both origins are found between sequences similar to the E. coli and Bacillus subtilis dnaA, dnaN, rpmH, and rnpA genes, a gene organization identical to that for B. subtilis and unlike that of E. coli. A second autonomously replicating sequence was obtained from P. aeruginosa that has some properties of bacterial origins.\r"

  ".W": "Subfractionation of a canine pancreatic homogenate was performed by several differential centrifugation steps, which gave rise to fractions with distinct marker profiles. Specific binding of guanosine 5'-[gamma-[35S]thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma-35S]) was assayed in each fraction. Enrichment of GTP[gamma-35S] binding was greatest in the interfacial \"smooth\" microsomal fraction, expected to contain Golgi and other smooth vesicles. There was also marked enrichment in the rough microsomal fraction. Electron microscopy and marker protein analysis revealed the rough microsomes (RMs) to be highly purified rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The distribution of small (low molecular weight) GTP binding proteins was examined by a [alpha-32P]GTP blot-overlay assay. Several apparent GTP binding proteins of molecular masses 22-25 kDa were detected in various subcellular fractions. In particular, at least two such proteins were found in the Golgi-enriched and RM fractions, suggesting that these small GTP binding proteins were localized to the Golgi and RER. To more precisely localize these proteins to the RER, native RMs and RMs stripped of ribosomes by puromycin/high salt were subjected to isopycnic centrifugation. The total GTP[gamma-35S] binding, as well as the small GTP binding proteins detected by the [alpha-32P]GTP blot overlay, distributed into fractions of high sucrose density, as did the RER marker ribophorin I. Consistent with a RER localization, when the RMs were stripped of ribosomes and subjected to isopycnic centrifugation, the total GTP[gamma-35S] binding and the small GTP binding proteins detected in the blot-overlay assay shifted to fractions of lighter sucrose density along with the RER marker.\r"

  ".W": "A small proteoglycan that contains only a single dermatan sulfate chain is the main proteoglycan synthesized by skin fibroblasts. Fibroblasts from a patient with progeroidal appearance and symptoms of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have a reduced ability of converting the core protein of this proteoglycan into a mature glycosaminoglycan chain-bearing species. This abnormality is the consequence of a deficiency in galactosyltransferase I (xylosylprotein 4-beta-galactosyltransferase; EC 2.4.1.133), which catalyzes the second glycosyl transfer reaction in the assembly of the dermatan sulfate chain. The glycosaminoglycan-free core protein secreted by the patient's fibroblasts bears an unsubstituted xylose residue. The mutant enzyme is abnormally thermolabile. Preincubation of fibroblasts at 41 degrees C leads to a further reduction in the production of mature proteoglycan and affects the capacity for glycosaminoglycan synthesis on p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xyloside more strongly in the mutant than in control cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified the Xenopus cognates for the RNA-binding protein A1. This protein has previously been shown to be one of the components of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complex in rat and human cells. We have isolated several Xenopus clones from oocyte, tailbud embryo, and leg muscle cDNA libraries and determined their nucleotide sequences. Potentially, two different A1 isoforms are expressed in Xenopus; they have been termed XA1a and XA1b. Besides insertions and deletions, the XA1a protein sequence is 92% identical to the rat protein and suggests very similar secondary structures. There are two segments in the COOH-terminal domain where deletions or insertions are apparent: the rat protein does not have a 48-residue sequence that is present in the frog protein, and the frog protein does not have a 12-residue sequence that is present in the rat protein. We have confirmed that the XA1a protein is larger than rat A1 by in vitro transcription, translation, and gel electrophoresis. The second isoform, XA1b, is very similar to the XA1a isoform, except it has a different COOH terminus due to the absence of a 73-nucleotide region from its cDNA clones. Transcripts representing both isoforms have been detected in various Xenopus RNA preparations by polymerase chain reaction experiments with A1-specific oligonucleotides. Our findings suggest that the isoforms are encoded by one or two genes and are the result of alternative splicing. We discuss the biological implications of having two forms of the A1 component of hnRNP particles.\r"

In vitro, these are the only plasma proteins that display a high affinity for actin. We infused increasing amounts of globular actin intravenously to rats to evaluate its disposition in plasma and tissues. Intravascular filament formation, microthrombi, and endothelial injury were observed, especially in the pulmonary circulation. These pathological changes were not observed when the globular actin in the infusate had been preincubated with the vitamin D-binding protein in vitro. Complexes of actin with both proteins were found in the plasma, suggesting a saturable, plasma actin-binding system in vivo. Our findings suggest that in vivo saturation of these proteins' actin-binding capacities may serve as a paradigm for pulmonary vascular disorders seen during widespread tissue trauma and cell lysis.\r"

Oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to nucleotides 2-14 of human U1 small nuclear RNA were investigated. Extensive cleavage of U1 RNA was observed with the unmodified oligodeoxynucleotide and with the phosphorothioate analogue but not with U1-complementary oligodeoxynucleotides containing methylphosphonate, phosphoro-N-morpholidate, or phosphoro-N-butylamidate internucleoside linkages. Additional experiments using a 514-nucleotide-long RNA substrate demonstrated the capacity of complementary phosphodiester- and phosphorothioate-linked oligodeoxynucleotides (but not ones containing methylphosphonate, phosphoro-N-morpholidate, or phosphoro-N-butylamidate linkages) to serve as RNase H targets when hybridized to an internal RNA site. Detailed comparisons revealed phosphodiester-linked oligodeoxynucleotides to be more efficient than the comparable phosphorothioate-linked oligomers with respect to RNase H action. Various pentadecamer oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the 514-nucleotide-long test RNA and containing 2-6 consecutive phosphodiester- or phosphorothioate-linked nucleotides flanked by RNase H-resistant methylphosphonate linkages afforded precise \"site-directed\" RNase H excision within the DNA.RNA hybrid. These results serve to assort modified oligodeoxynucleotide-containing hybrids into RNase H-sensitive and -resistant classes and also provide clues as to how RNase H makes contact with the DNA strand in a DNA.RNA hybrid.\r"

In the presence of interleukin 3 (IL-3), plate-bound (PB) IgE and PB-IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b are excellent stimulants, whereas PB-IgA and PB-IgM fail to stimulate IL-4 production. In the absence of IL-3, PB-IgE stimulates relatively modest production of IL-4, whereas PB-IgG2a generally does not. The response to PB-IgE is inhibited by soluble IgE; antibody to Fc gamma receptor II inhibits the response to PB-IgG2a. Thus, separate receptors mediate these stimulations, and Fc receptor cross-linkage is required for IL-4 production. Depletion of cells expressing asialo-GM1 does not diminish IL-4 production in response to PB immunoglobulins, indicating that natural killer cells are not essential for non-B, non-T cell production of IL-4. In addition to IL-4, non-B, non-T cells produce IL-3, but no detectable interleukin 2 or interferon gamma. Non-B, non-T cells may be an important source of lymphokines in a variety of immune responses and may serve to amplify the effects of T cells of the TH2 type.\r"

The predicted amino acid sequence comprises two distinct regions, a carboxyl-terminal two-thirds that is 23% lysine and bears similarity to histone H1 and an amino-terminal one-third containing a hydrophobic stretch of about 15 amino acids. Two macronuclear versions of the gene differ in nucleotide sequence at several positions, but the derived polypeptides differ only at a single position, Ser-110 or Ala-110. Both versions harbor a small intron. The existence of this intron demonstrates that, despite the elimination of 95% of the micronuclear genome from the developing macronucleus, at least some noncoding DNA is retained during macronuclear development of hypotrichous ciliates.\r"

[Charbonneau, H., Tonks, N. K., Walsh, K. A. & Fischer, E. H. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 7182-7186]. The isolated clones encode a PTPase of 432 amino acids having a mass of 49,679 daltons and showing 97% sequence identity to the corresponding 321 residues of the placental enzyme. The coding sequence of the PTPase was placed behind a bacteriophage T7 promoter and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein had a molecular weight of 50,000 by SDS/PAGE analysis and showed an absolute specificity for phosphotyrosine-containing substrates. Northern analysis documented that there were two sizes of RNA, 4.3 and 2.0 kilobases, which encode the PTPase. Both transcripts were present in a number of tissues, and the smaller RNA appears to arise by the use of an alternative polyadenylylation signal. The PTPase was also localized by in situ hybridization in the rat central nervous system. A diffuse pattern of hybridization signal is seen in a number of brain areas, with the hippocampus showing the highest levels of mRNA. Sequences located at the C terminus of the rat brain PTPase contain possible sites for phosphorylation as well as signals which could serve for membrane attachment.\r"

We have also manipulated cellular charged and uncharged [tRNA(Trp)] by two means: (i) the strain used contains a Trp-tRNA synthetase mutation that increases the Km for Trp; thus, varying exogenous Trp varies cellular Trp-tRNA(Trp); and (ii) we have introduced into the mutant strain a plasmid containing the tRNA(Trp) gene behind an inducible promoter; thus, total [tRNA(Trp)] also can be varied depending on length of induction. The use of these conditions, combined with a previously characterized assay system, has allowed us to demonstrate that (i) the rate of incorporation of Trp into protein is proportional to the fraction of tRNA(Trp) that is charged; for any given total [tRNA(Trp)], this rate is also proportional to the [Trp-tRNA(Trp)]; (ii) uncharged tRNA(Trp) inhibits incorporation of Trp into protein; and (iii) rates of incorporation into protein of at least two other amino acids, Lys and Cys, are also sensitive to [Trp-tRNA(Trp)] and are inhibited by uncharged tRNA(Trp). Our results are consistent with models of translational control that postulate modulating polypeptide chain elongation efficiency by varying concentrations of specific tRNAs.\r"

Rabbit serum was active at dilutions as great as one part in 10 million. Intracellularly applied serum was ineffective, and externally applied serum failed to trigger oscillatory currents when the intracellular level of ionized calcium was prevented from rising by loading the oocyte with EGTA. The serum also caused an increase of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the oocyte. We conclude that serum contains a factor which activates a membrane receptor that is coupled to the phosphatidylinositol second messenger system. The active factor is a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 60-70 kDa in gel permeation chromatography. Although the normal function of the serum factor is still unknown, it may have far-reaching implications, because it acts on the multifunctional phosphatidylinositol phosphate signaling system. Also, because of its great potency the serum factor and Xenopus oocytes are very useful for probing the operation of the phosphatidylinositol system.\r"

  ".W": "The murine lymphokine, interleukin 4 (IL-4) is able to specifically promote isotype switching to IgG1 and IgE in cultures of mitogen-stimulated B cells. Emerging evidence suggests that germ-line immunoglobulin heavy chain gene transcription may direct switching by modulating switch-region accessibility to a recombinase. In this study, cloned cDNA copies of the germ-line epsilon heavy chain transcript have been used to determine the genomic organization of this transcription unit. The 5' end of these transcripts are derived from an exon, denoted I epsilon, located 2 kilobases 5' of the C epsilon switch region [C epsilon = epsilon heavy chain constant (C) region gene]. Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that this RNA does not encode a protein, as the I epsilon exon contains termination codons in all reading frames. Germ-line epsilon chain transcripts can be detected in cultures of normal splenic B cells treated with IL-4 within 24 hr, and this expression correlates with subsequent switching to C epsilon. Consistent with the IL-4 inducibility of this RNA is the identification of a motif upstream from the site of transcription initiation that closely resembles a transcription element implicated in the IL-4 regulation of the gene encoding the murine class II histocompatibility antigen, A alpha k. These data lend support to the accessibility model of isotype switching and implicate IL-4 in the transcriptional activation of the C epsilon locus.\r"

These methods have been applied to various degrees in epidemiologic studies and have contributed to a better understanding of C. difficile-associated disease. The method based on the use of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins and the development of an automated scanner with computer analysis made possible the recognition of 15 distinct types of C. difficile, based on the major radiolabeled protein patterns. These proteins were strain-specific and immunogenic, as demonstrated by immunoblotting and DNA restriction endonuclease analysis. Epidemiologic studies revealed cross-infection among patients, nosocomial acquisition, and a direct relation between symptoms and type of C. difficile. The development of DNA probes based on antibiotic resistance genes, toxin A, and cloned specific common antigens is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The nucleosome is the fundamental unit of assembly of the chromosome and reversible modifications of the histones have been suggested to be important in many aspects of nucleosome function. The structure-function relations of the amino-terminal domain of yeast histone H4 were examined by the creation of directed point mutations. The four lysines subject to reversible acetylation were essential for histone function as the substitution of arginine or asparagine at these four positions was lethal. No single lysine residue was completely essential since arginine substitutions at each position were viable, although several of these mutants were slower in completing DNA replication. The simultaneous substitution of glutamine for the four lysine residues was viable but conferred several phenotypes including mating sterility, slow progression through the G2/M period of the division cycle, and temperature-sensitive growth, as well as a prolonged period of DNA replication. These results provide genetic proof for the roles of the H4 amino-terminal domain lysines in gene expression, replication, and nuclear division.\r"

  ".U": "90161990\r", 
  ".W": "The 11-kD protease (PR) encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is essential for the correct processing of viral polyproteins and the maturation of infectious virus, and is therefore a target for the design of selective acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) therapeutics. To facilitate the identification of novel inhibitors of HIV-1 PR, as well as to permit detailed studies on the enzymology and inhibition of this enzyme, a continuous assay for its activity was developed that was based on intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (RET). The assay used the quenched fluorogenic substrate 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL)--Ser Gln Asn Tyr Pro Ile Val Gln--5-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1 sulfonic acid (EDANS), whose peptide sequence is derived from a natural processing site for HIV-1 PR. Incubation of recombinant HIV-1 PR with the fluorogenic substrate resulted in specific cleavage at the Tyr-Pro bond and a time-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity that was linearly related to the extent of substrate hydrolysis. An internally quenched fluorogenic substrate was also designed that was selectively cleaved by the related PR from avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). The fluorescence quantum yields of the HIV-1 PR and AMV PR substrates in the RET assay increased by 40.0- and 34.4-fold, respectively, per mole of substrate cleaved. Because of its simplicity, rapidity, and precision in the determination of reaction rates required for kinetic analysis, this method offers many advantages over the commonly used high-performance liquid chromatography- or electrophoresis-based assays for peptide substrate hydrolysis by retroviral PRs.\r"

The polymerase chain reaction and conventional library screening were used to isolate a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the rat substance P receptor from brain and submandibular gland. By homology analysis, this receptor belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The receptor cDNA was expressed in a mammalian cell line and the ligand binding properties of the encoded receptor were pharmacologically defined by Scatchard analysis and tachykinin peptide displacement as those of a substance P receptor. The distribution of the messenger RNA for this receptor is highest in urinary bladder, submandibular gland, striatum, and spinal cord, which is consistent with the known distribution of substance P receptor binding sites. Thus, this receptor appears to mediate the primary actions of substance P in various brain regions and peripheral tissues.\r"

In this report, ANP suppressed the calcium and sodium currents in rat and guinea pig ventricular myocytes. The suppression of sodium current was caused by enhanced permeability of the sodium channel to calcium without significant changes in the kinetics or the tetrodotoxin sensitivity of the channel. Thus, ANP may regulate the sodium channel by altering its cationic selectivity site to calcium, thereby repressing the sodium current. The suppression of sodium and calcium channels and the resultant depressed excitability of the atrial cells may help to regulate ANP secretion.\r"

The results showed that the subcapsule of the kidney was not a good site for implantation of relatively impure islet preparations, or of purified islet preparations if the mass of tissue implanted was marginal. The spleen was a much better site for the islet implantation, allowing fasting normoglycemia in many of the animals. The results of histologic examination of the spleen four to six weeks after intrasplenic islet transplantation showed good preservation of islet morphologic features, with numerous islets scattered throughout the spleen. Cells secreting insulin, glucagon and somatostatin were present in approximately normal proportions. Transplantation of islets into the portal vein produced good short and long term function. A number of grafts failed between four and 18 months, this failure being related to the function demonstrated at six weeks by intravenous glucose tolerance tests. Animals with poor initial function tended to fail early. However, those with good initial function continued to gain weight and remain normoglycemic up to 2.5 years, providing encouragement to improve further the yield and purity of the islet preparation as well as seeking more efficient techniques for islet implantation.\r"

The ex vivo method allows the study of arachidonic acid metabolites released from brain slices at different times after subarachnoid hemorrhage induction and reflects the residual capacity for arachidonic acid metabolism after the pathologic event. The rats were sacrificed 30 minutes, 1 and 6 hours, and 2 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced by the injection of 0.30 ml autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna. Concentration of prostaglandin D2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha was increased significantly relative to control 2 days after induction. The concentration of prostaglandin E2 was increased significantly 6 hours after induction, while ex vivo production of leukotriene C4 was increased significantly at 1 and 6 hours and 2 days. The correlation between these results and the occurrence of vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage is discussed. The results obtained from the ex vivo incubation of brain tissue slices after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage suggest that after the hemorrhage there is a significant modification of brain eicosanoid metabolism, which could be of great importance in interpreting the pathogenesis of subarachnoid hemorrhage-related neuronal impairment.\r"

Unexpectedly, the predominant effect on red cell storage was an initial elevation of ATP levels, followed by remarkable maintenance of these levels at 12 to 18 weeks with acceptable 24-hour survival. The aim of the study reported here was to investigate the reasons for the advantageous effects of the different constituents. With the new preservation medium, ATP content was maintained at acceptable levels for at least 8 weeks with low spontaneous hemolysis. However, similarly high ATP levels were also maintained in the absence of ammonium chloride. Comparable results were obtained on substituting sodium for potassium salts in the new medium. When the main cation in the preservation medium was replaced by sodium, the addition of ammonium or rubidium chloride did not provide an advantage. Therefore, ammonium chloride was not essential for this medium, whereas mannitol does seem to be essential in a solution whose content of nonpermeant solutes is hypotonic.\r"

  ".U": "90164306\r", 
  ".W": "The use of serial chest radiographs to assess disease activity in patients with sarcoidosis is controversial. However, reliance on the symptomatic clinical course to assess disease activity may be misleading. As many patients being treated with corticosteroids have an abrupt clinical deterioration when doses of those medications are decreased, we questioned whether the chest radiograph could depict alterations in disease activity as measured by spirometry in this subset of patients. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of all patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis in whom the corticosteroid dose was reduced during a 6-month period. The 15 patients without fever, chills, or purulent sputum during that time were then examined to determine the presence (n = 10) or absence (n = 5) of a symptomatic relapse. All patients who had a symptomatic relapse also had a fall in forced vital capacity of at least 10%, suggesting an increase in disease activity. Serial chest radiographs were evaluated during and after corticosteroid dose reductions and after clinical recovery on higher steroid doses in the patients who had had a relapse. In eight patients, the disease was in radiographic stage 2 (hilar adenopathy and parenchymal lung disease); in seven patients it was in radiographic stage 3 (parenchymal lung disease alone). The disease did not change stage in any patient during the study. Chest radiographs worsened more frequently in patients who had a clinical relapse (seven of 10) than in those who did not have a relapse (zero of five, p less than .05). An alveolar chest radiographic pattern (n = 4) or reticulonodular pattern (n = 3) was noted in the seven patients who had a relapse, with worsening on radiographs often occurring before detection of relapse by symptomatology (four of seven) or spirometry (three of seven). Spirometry and radiographs improved or stabilized after an increase in corticosteroid dose in all 10 patients who had a relapse. We conclude that serial chest radiographs can reflect clinical relapse in patients with sarcoidosis during corticosteroid dose reduction. Furthermore, worsening seen on chest radiographs may be the first evidence of relapse.\r"

However, the accuracy of these features in the differential diagnosis of diffuse pleural disease has not been assessed before. Without knowledge of clinical or pathologic data, we reviewed the CT findings in 74 consecutive patients with proved diffuse pleural disease (39 malignant and 35 benign). The patients included 53 men and 21 women 23-78 years old. Features that were helpful in distinguishing malignant from benign pleural disease were (1) circumferential pleural thickening, (2) nodular pleural thickening, (3) parietal pleural thickening greater than 1 cm, and (4) mediastinal pleural involvement. The specificities of these findings were 100%, 94%, 94%, and 88%, respectively. The sensitivities were 41%, 51%, 36%, and 56%, respectively. Twenty-eight of 39 malignant cases (sensitivity, 72%; specificity, 83%) were identified correctly by the presence of one or more of these criteria. Malignant mesothelioma (n = 11) could not be reliably differentiated from pleural metastases (n = 24).

On CT scans, five cases showed mild circumferential wall thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum, thickening of the ileocecal valve, and a few regional nodes. One case presented as nonspecific small-bowel obstruction. In five patients a more characteristic CT appearance was detected: preferential thickening of the ileocecal valve and medial wall of the cecum, exophytic extension engulfing the terminal ileum, and massive lymphadenopathy with low-density areas consistent with caseation necrosis. Patients with AIDS had a more severe form of involvement than those who did not have AIDS. Barium studies showed ileocecal changes consistent with an inflammatory process. In conjunction with barium enema, CT is helpful in the initial evaluation of ileocecal tuberculosis, showing the location and extent of intestinal and mesenteric involvement in most cases. Characteristic CT findings are seen when the inflammatory process is severe.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the pathologic basis for low-intensity nodules seen on MR images of the liver in patients with cirrhosis, we obtained spin-echo and gradient-echo MR images in 20 cirrhotic patients in whom partial hepatectomies were subsequently performed for hepatocellular carcinoma. Low-intensity liver nodules were shown on gradient-echo and spin-echo images in eight patients. Pathologic study of the liver in these patients showed that these nodules were regenerating nodules containing hemosiderin. Low-intensity nodules were seen only on T2-weighted spin-echo images in four other patients. Microscopic examination of the liver in these patients showed regenerating nodules without hemosiderin deposits. Broad fibrous septa containing vascular spaces were present in two of these four patients. These results suggest that regenerating nodules containing hemosiderin or those that are surrounded by vascular fibrous septa are visible on MR images as low-intensity nodules and that gradient-echo images are useful in demonstrating nodules with hemosiderin.\r"

A basket pattern (a fine blood-flow network surrounding the tumor nodule) was observed in 15 (75%) of the 20 hepatocellular carcinomas. An image of vessels within the tumor (blood flow that runs into and branches within the tumor) was observed in 13 (65%) of the 20 hepatocellular carcinomas. These two findings were observed only in hepatocellular carcinomas; even when the tumor was smaller than 2 cm in diameter, these findings were observed frequently. In the patients with multiple hepatic metastases, a \"detour\" pattern (a dilated portal vein meandering around the tumor nodules) was observed. In three of the six hemangiomas, a \"spot\" pattern (color-stained dots or patches in the central region of the tumor) was seen. Our experience suggests that hepatocellular carcinomas have a characteristic appearance on color Doppler flow images.\r"

The diagnoses were proved by histology or follow-up. Hemangiomas had a significantly greater mean T2 value (192.1 +/- 34.8 msec) than did both benign liver cell tumors (71.9 +/- 16.9 msec; p less than .01) and primary or metastatic malignant tumors (79.7 +/- 21.2 msec; p less than .01), but the T2 values of benign liver cell tumors and malignant tumors were not significantly different. Both hemangiomas and benign liver cell tumors had a significantly greater mean signal-intensity ratio (1.86 +/- 0.60 and 1.77 +/- 0.26, respectively) than did malignant tumors (1.04 +/- 0.34; p less than .01) in the early phase after Gd-DTPA administration, and hemangiomas had a significantly greater signal-intensity ratio (1.59 +/- 0.21) than did both benign liver cell tumors (1.21 +/- 0.08; p less than .01) and malignant tumors (1.06 +/- 0.26; p less than .01) in the delayed phase.

  ".W": "Approximately 30% of all patients who have spinal cord injuries have gastrointestinal symptoms. One cause is gallstone disease; indeed the literature suggests that gallstones are more common in patients with spinal cord injuries because these patients have impaired contractility of the gallbladder with a reduced ejection fraction. To test this hypothesis, we obtained gallbladder sonograms in 30 patients with spinal cord injuries (16 quadriplegics and 14 paraplegics) and in 32 uninjured age-matched control subjects. Four patients and four asymptomatic control subjects had gallstones and were excluded. The remaining 26 patients and 28 control subjects fasted for 12 hr. Longitudinal and transverse sonograms of the gallbladder were made immediately before the ingestion of 25 g of fat, and at 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min thereafter. Gallbladder volumes were measured by using the ellipsoid method. Resting and residual volumes and the emptying times were determined and the ejection fractions were calculated. The ejection fractions were significantly lower (p = .003) in the patients than in the control subjects because the resting volumes were lower than in the control subjects (p = .013). However, the emptying times and residual volumes were the same in the two groups. We conclude that gallbladder contractility is normal in patients with spinal cord injuries and that the lower ejection fraction found in such patients is due to a smaller resting volume.\r"

On sonograms, five lesions were anechoic and one was echogenic. On CT scans, all lesions except one were of lower attenuation than the surrounding spleen. None of the lesions enhanced after administration of IV contrast material. Although rare, splenic hydatidosis should be included in the differential diagnosis when a cystic splenic lesion is identified with sonography or CT.\r"

  ".W": "Distinguishing seminomatous from nonseminomatous testicular neoplasms preoperatively is useful because treatment of these two tumors types is different. We evaluated whether the distinction could be made with MR imaging in six patients with seminomatous and nine patients with nonseminomatous testicular tumors (including teratoma, teratocarcinoma, embryonal cell, and choriocarcinoma). The MR diagnoses, which were obtained from the formal reports of the MR studies done and interpreted before orchiectomy, were compared with the pathologic diagnosis. The distinction between the two tumor types on MR images was based on the signal intensity and heterogeneity of the lesion. We also retrospectively compared the MR findings with tissue histology. MR scans in nonseminomatous tumors showed a marked heterogeneous mix of signals, with some regions less intense and others more intense than normal testicular tissue on both proton-density and T2-weighted images. The typical background signal was nearly equal to normal testicular tissue. The tumors also had a dark band at their periphery that correlated with a fibrous tumor capsule on histologic examination. In contradistinction, seminomatous tumors were isointense with testis on proton-density images and consistently hypointense and relatively homogeneous on T2-weighted images. These tumors typically lacked a capsule on MR images. One lesion, only 3 mm in diameter, could not be characterized on MR images because of limitations in spatial and contrast resolution. In 13 of the 14 lesions that could be characterized, the histologic type was predicted correctly on the basis of the MR appearance. The one error occurred in a patient with pure seminoma. Although the MR appearance of the lesion was otherwise similar to the other seminomas, the lesion had a single focus of bright signal that was due to hemorrhage. This focus was interpreted incorrectly as a nonseminomatous element. Our findings in this small series of patients suggest that MR imaging can be used to distinguish seminomatous from nonseminomatous testicular tumors.\r"

Although transabdominal scanning is useful to determine if hydrocolpos or hydrometrocolpos is present, this method does not allow measurement of the thickness of a caudally placed obstructive septum. This information is useful in planning reconstructive surgery. All seven patients had transabdominal sonography, with five showing a low-lying obstruction. In those five patients, the distance between the perineal surface and the caudal aspect of the distended vagina, measured with electronic calipers on the transperineal sonograms, ranged from 1.0 to 4.0 cm. We conclude that when vaginal atresia is clinically suspected, transabdominal sonography should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. When a low-lying obstruction is identified, transperineal sonography should be performed to determine the length of the obstructive segment.\r"

In 13 of 14 patients who had had correlative surgery, we accurately predicted the presence and extent of attachment of the fragment to the talus by performing preoperative MR imaging. The other patient had a false-positive diagnosis of a chondral fragment. All seven partially attached fragments had an irregular high-signal zone on T2-weighted images at the fragment/talar interface. The four unattached fragments had a complete ring of fluid surrounding the lesion. On the basis of these findings, we think MR of the ankle can be used to assess accurately talar osteochondral lesion stability and aid in clinical decision making.\r"

The CT scans of four asymptomatic subtalar implants showed each implant in the expected position and orientation, and the findings were considered normal. Conversely, the findings on CT scans of all nine painful implants (seven patients) were interpreted as abnormal. The scans showed oblique orientation of four implants (44%), loosening of three implants (33%), extruded methyl methacrylate in the subtalar joint in two implants (22%), and abnormal calcaneal recession in two implants (22%). Five of the nine painful implants were revised with improvement or resolution of symptoms.

Previous reports have discussed the usefulness of certain clinical predictors of renal injury, such as the amount of hematuria present, the presence of shock or of head injury, and the presence or absence of symptoms or findings on physical examination. To assess the value of such predictors of renal injury in children with posttraumatic hematuria, we reviewed and analyzed the medical records and abdominal CT examinations of 256 children with blunt abdominal trauma. One hundred six children (41%) had hematuria. Thirty-five patients (14%) had renal injury that could be diagnosed by using CT. Nine of these had clinically significant injuries according to our criteria. We found a direct relationship between the amount of hematuria and the severity of renal injury. Hypotension at presentation occurred in 38 patients and was an insensitive predictor of renal injury. The combination of hypotension and hematuria was no more sensitive than hematuria alone in predicting renal injury. Sixty patients had concomitant craniofacial injuries. This subgroup had the same prevalence of hematuria and renal injury as the group that did not have head injuries. There were no clinically occult renal injuries in the study population. Furthermore, we found that no normotensive child with fewer than 50 RBCs per high-power field had a significant renal injury, and conversely, all children with significant renal injuries had either large amounts of hematuria or shock.\r"

This led us to reevaluate the role of duplex Doppler imaging in this population. Among 135 pediatric liver transplant patients, 20 had arteriography for suspected hepatic artery thrombosis. Duplex and/or color Doppler imaging was performed in 13 of these children. The Doppler examination failed to show hepatic artery signals in five patients. Arteriography showed hepatic artery thrombosis in all five. In three of these, subsequent Doppler examinations showed reappearance of arterial Doppler signals. Arteriography confirmed the interval development of collaterals. Hepatic artery signals were found on the Doppler examinations of the remaining eight patients. Four had normal arteriograms, but the remaining four had hepatic artery thrombosis with collateral formation. Patients with hepatic artery thrombosis and collateral circulation tended to have increased diastolic flow (decreased resistive index). In addition, early scans clearly identified patients with complete thrombosis before collateral formation. On the basis of our preliminary experience, a child with a liver transplant and a clinical history strongly suggestive of hepatic artery compromise should have arteriography despite an apparently normal Doppler examination.\r"

Tumors were found in 22% of the patients and were benign or of low-grade malignancy in every case. MR was accurate in the preoperative diagnosis of structural lesions, including very small occult tumors and cryptic vascular malformations. In patients with mesial temporal gliosis, there was correlation between the MR observation of a unilaterally dilated anterior temporal horn and the EEG-identified seizure focus and side of temporal lobectomy. However, MR demonstrated T2-weighted signal abnormalities correlating with the epileptogenic focus in only 8% of cases of mesial temporal gliosis. MR provided useful information in 28% of patients who underwent surgery for refractory complex partial epilepsy. MR obviated invasive EEG monitoring in 93% of the patients with structural lesions.

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to describe our experience with Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging in the evaluation of the most common nasopharyngeal tumors. Forty-two patients with tumors of the nasopharynx and adjacent spaces had MR imaging before and after IV injection of Gd-DTPA. Images were obtained with a 1.0-T superconducting magnet imaging system in transverse, coronal, and sagittal planes with T1- and T2-weighted sequences. MR images were compared with CT scans and tumor histology. The studies were categorized by using a grading system with grades ranging from unsatisfactory (grade 0) to optimal (grade 3). Contrast-enhanced MR enables better identification of small anatomic details such as both palatini muscles and the pharyngobasilar fascia. MR after Gd-DTPA was superior to CT in all cases except for tumors of the maxillary sinuses. MR with Gd-DTPA is recommended for tumors that are small and difficult to detect on the initial nonenhanced MR examination or that show subtle infiltrations. Because of the increased cost and longer examination time, MR with Gd-DTPA does not need to be done when large tumors are well delineated.\r"

  ".W": "Thin (5-mm) coronal high-field (1.5-T) MR images of four human brain specimens and 14 normal volunteers were correlated with myelin-stained microtomic sections of the specimen cerebella. The primary white-matter tracts innervating several hemispheric (posterior quadrangular, superior, and inferior semilunar, gracile, biventer, tonsil) and vermian (declive, folium, tuber) lobules are oriented perpendicularly to the coronal plane of section and are shown well on proton-density-weighted (long TR/short TE) and T2-weighted (long TR/long TE) spin-echo images, which provide excellent contrast between gray and white matter. Several of the surface sulci and fissures of the cerebellar hemispheres (including the superior posterior, horizontal, secondary, and posterolateral fissures) also course perpendicular to the coronal plane and are depicted well on T1-weighted (short TR/short TE) and T2-weighted images, which maximize contrast between CSF and parenchyma. The opportunity for side-to-side comparison of the hemispheres is a distinct advantage of the coronal view. Nevertheless, more obliquely oriented surfaces (preculminate, primary, inferior posterior, inferior anterior, and intrabiventral fissures) and deep hemispheric structures (primary white-matter tracts to central, anterior quadrangular, and floccular lobules) may be obscured by volume-averaging in the coronal plane; moreover, much of the finer anatomy of the vermis is depicted poorly. The constant surface and deep anatomy of the cerebellum revealed on coronal images in normal volunteers encourages detailed mapping. MR imaging in the coronal plane should be especially useful in identifying, localizing, and quantifying normal and abnormal morphologic differences between the cerebellar hemispheres.\r"

Positive findings in others included diffuse atrophy in 34%, mass lesions (cryptococcoma) in 11%, hydrocephalus in 9%, and diffuse cerebral edema in 3%. Two unusual types of cryptococcoma were encountered, namely gelatinous pseudocysts and an intraventricular cryptococcal cyst. All findings were nonspecific for CNS cryptococcosis. The results suggest that CNS cryptococcosis should be considered in all patients at risk for the disease who have these abnormal CT findings, no matter what their initial clinical presentation. In addition, MR demonstration of gelatinous pseudocysts in one patient indicates that this technique may be helpful in locating cryptococcal mass lesions not visualized on CT.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen cases of pathologically proved intracranial gangliogliomas were reviewed to determine their MR, CT, and clinical characteristics. Seventeen patients were evaluated with contrast-enhanced CT and 14 were studied by MR imaging. Eight tumors were predominantly cystic; half of these demonstrated some contrast enhancement, and five contained calcifications. These cystic gangliogliomas were located, in order of decreasing frequency, in the cerebellum, temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes. Ten tumors were solid; eight of these showed contrast enhancement, and only one contained calcifications. Small cysts were present in one solid mass. Solid gangliogliomas occurred preferentially in the temporal lobes. On MR, the findings were nonspecific and reflected the CT findings. In one patient who received gadolinium-DTPA the lesion did not enhance. Clinically, all patients presented with nonfocal long-standing symptoms and all but three were alive an average of 18 months after the initial diagnosis. Pathologists are recognizing ganglioglioma with increasing frequency, and although its radiographic characteristics vary, it should be included in the differential diagnosis when the above-described findings are encountered.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen symptomatic iliac artery stenoses and three occlusions in 16 patients were treated by the percutaneous implantation of Wallstent endoprostheses (Medinvent SA, Lausanne, Switzerland). The endoprosthesis consists of stainless steel monofilaments braided into a self-expanding cylinder. The indications for placement were restenosis after angioplasty (10 cases), failed arterial dilations (eight cases), and restenosis after endarterectomy (one case). The prostheses used had a mean diameter of 8 mm (range, 6-10 mm) and were placed in the external iliac (14 cases) and common iliac (five cases) arteries. The 16 stenoses were greater than 80%, and the three occlusions were longer than 7 cm. Mean length of the lesions treated was 7 cm (range, 4-14 cm). Three of the arteries thrombosed after treatment, one 2 days later and two in the month after implantation of the stent. On clinical and angiographic follow-up (mean, 16 months; range, 1-24 months) no symptoms or stenoses reappeared in the remaining 16 cases. Our experience in these cases suggests that implantation of a Wallstent endovascular prosthesis is a valuable technique for the treatment of external and common iliac artery stenoses.\r"
