We assessed protein metabolism in infants fed formulas with reduced protein contents and various whey/casein ratios. Term infants (n = 40) received either human milk or formula containing 1.8 g protein/100 kcal and whey/casein ratios 18:82, 34:66, or 50:50. At ages 4 and 8 weeks, growth indices and mean serum concentrations of retinol binding protein, albumin, total protein, and serum urea nitrogen were similar, as were mean plasma concentrations of total amino acids, total essential amino acids, and their ratio. Compared with infants fed human milk, those fed formula had plasma concentrations similar for valine, lysine, arginine, tyrosine, histidine, threonine, and free and total cyst(e)ine; elevated for phenylalanine, methionine, and citrulline; and depressed for taurine and tryptophan. Except for leucine, mean plasma amino acid values varied similarly among formula groups despite differences in intakes. Our data indicate that feeding formulas providing 1.8 g protein/100 kcal results in many indices of protein metabolism characteristic of human milk feeding. However, certain differences are noted, suggesting the need for further manipulation of specific amino acid patterns of infant formulas.\r"

BCG (100 micrograms.) was administered intravesically on days 7 and 14 after seeding bladders with MBT-2 cells. IL2 (5,000 U/injection) was given intraperitoneally every eight hours for 10 times (days seven through 10 and 14 through 17). BCG or IL2 therapy alone failed to reduce incidence of tumor implantation and tumor weight; whereas, combined treatment with BCG and IL2 reduced tumor weight significantly compared to saline or BCG treated mice. Cytotoxicity was assessed in a four-hour 75Semethionine-release assay. Augmentation of natural killer cell activity was only observed in mice treated with BCG plus IL2. MBT-2 target cells were not lysed by spleen cells from mice treated with BCG or saline. IL2 therapy produced lymphokine-activated killer cell activity, though combining BCG with IL2 suppressed this activity after each course of treatment. The results suggest that combined treatment with IL2 enhances the therapeutic effect of BCG therapy. However, this enhancement of antitumor activity is not clearly explained by augmentation of natural killer or in vivo-generated lymphokine-activated killer cells.\r"

The conditions of six (86%) of these seven women have progressed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (WR6 classification). Chronic refractory vaginal candidiasis may be a presenting symptom of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Women with human immunodeficiency virus infection and unexplained oral and vaginal candidiasis are at high risk to develop other opportunistic infections.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] on proliferation and de novo DNA synthesis were studied in the following established human leukemia cell lines: lymphoblastic T-cell lines HPB-ALL, CCRF-HSB-2, p12/lchikawa, and HPB-MLT; adult T-cell leukemia- (ATL) and human lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected T-cell lines HUT102, HUT-102B2, MT-1, MT-2, MJ, C2/MJ, KH-2, KH-2Lo, HPB-CTL-1, and ATN-C1; ATL-derived B-cell lines ATL-BK9 and ATL-BK10; lymphoblastic B-cell line Daudi; and myelocytic-monocytic lineage cell lines HL-60 and U937. 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited proliferation and de novo DNA synthesis of phytohemagglutinin-P-activated T-cells and certain established HTLV-I-positive T-cells. However, it did not inhibit immature lymphoblastic T- and B-cells or ATL-derived B-cells. The degree of inhibition depended on the dose of 1,25(OH)2D3 and the heterogeneity of the established HTLV-I-positive T-cells. KH-2 and subclone KH-2Lo were markedly inhibited, and HPB-CTL-1 was moderately inhibited. Marked inhibition of DNA synthesis in KH-2Lo cells was observed in the proliferative phase of the cell cycle. No inhibition of KH-2Lo proliferation or expression of interleukin-2 and transferrin receptor was noted after removal of 1,25(OH)2D3 from the culture medium. 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced multinucleated cell formation of various HTLV-I-positive T-cell lines and TPA-induced HTLV-I p19 expression in KH-2Lo cells.\r"

  ".W": "Tumorigenicity of 2 sublines, TU1 and TM5, of the C.B6-H-2dm4 (dm4) mouse tumor, TDM4, was tested in dm4 and F1 hybrid mice (from crosses of dm4 with a variety of other strains) to determine the genetics of hybrid resistance to these 2 tumor sublines. Resistance to TU1 was associated with at least 3 genes and required heterozygosity in the H-2D region, with secondary effects attributable to H-2K genes and non-H-2 genes. Resistance to TM5, however, did not require H-2D region heterozygosity, whereas H-2K and non-H-2 genes appeared to have significant effects. For evaluation of possible mechanisms for hybrid resistance, 4 assay systems were used. Comparison of natural killer cell activity in dm4 and various hybrid mice revealed no consistent activity against either TU1 or TM5. Little correlation was seen between resistance and generation of strong T-lymphocyte proliferative responses to the sublines. Likewise, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity, particularly against TU1, was not associated with increased resistance. In contrast, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) was consistently greater in hybrids with increased resistance to either subline. These results suggest a strong association between DTH responsiveness and hybrid resistance. Furthermore, the association, in some hybrids, of CTL activity with resistance to the TM5 subline, but not to TU1, may mean that different sublines of the same tumor can induce different sets of immune responses.\r"

Cells were identified by monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte cell-surface antigens and immunoperoxidase labelling. Leukocytes, as defined by a monoclonal antibody to the leukocyte common antigen (PHM1), were present in normal, human renal tissue in both glomeruli (2.8 +/- 0.6 cells/glom. cross section) and interstitium (102 +/- 18 cells/mm2). Monocytes constituted the predominant infiltrating cell type in normal glomeruli (1.3 +/- 0.2) and T cells were rarely found (0.3: range 0 to 0.8), whereas both monocytes (34 +/- 10/mm2) and T lymphocytes (33 +/- 14/mm2) were found in the normal interstitium. In the non-proliferative forms of glomerulonephritis there was no significant increase in the number of glomerular inflammatory cells when compared with normal glomeruli. However, significantly increased numbers of T lymphocytes were seen in the interstitium of biopsies with minor non-specific changes (67 +/- 15/mm2), membranous nephropathy (134 +/- 30/mm2), focal glomerulosclerosis (207 +/- 53/mm2), and diabetic nephropathy (198 +/- 81/mm2). In the proliferative forms of glomerulonephritis only crescentic GN and post-infectious GN demonstrated significantly-increased glomerular monocytes and granulocytes. There was no significant increase in the number of glomerular T cells when compared with normal glomeruli. However, there was a significant increase in the number of interstitial T lymphocytes in all forms of proliferative glomerulonephritis when compared with the normal interstitial cell population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With use of our diagnostic-retrieval system, we identified 28 patients with the Marfan syndrome who were 32 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis. These patients had at least two of four major diagnostic criteria for the Marfan syndrome--a confirmed family history, a long-limbed habitus, dislocated lenses, and disease of the aortic root. In these relatively older patients, some clinical findings (the ocular disorder and the family history) corresponded to the expected findings in younger patients with the Marfan syndrome; however, the proportion of those with cardiovascular disease was greater. Echocardiography has improved the potential for detection of the cardiac lesions, the most frequent cause of death in these patients. Early diagnosis of the Marfan syndrome is important so that complications of the cardiac lesions can be prevented or delayed and so that genetic counseling can be done at an appropriate time.\r"

The geometric mean blood-lead value was 10.4 micrograms/dl. In a stratified subsample, 501 children completed individual tests of cognitive ability and educational attainment from the British Ability Scales (BAS). An extensive home interview with a parent was also done. Multiple regression analyses showed a significant negative relation between log blood-lead and BAS combined score, number skills, and word reading when thirty-three possible confounding variables were taken into account. There was a dose-response relation between blood-lead and test scores, with no evidence of a threshold. The size of the effect was small compared with that of other factors. Lead at low levels of exposure probably has a small harmful effect on the performance of children in ability and attainment tests.\r"

Demyelination was minimal day 15 postimmunization (p.i.) when conduction velocity already was reduced, somewhat more pronounced day 17 p.i. when nerve conduction was blocked, and most pronounced day 23 p.i. when nerve conduction partially had recovered. This suggests a dissociation between the degree of demyelination and the functional deficits. Decrease of sciatic nerve conduction velocities coincided with endoneurial appearance of T-lymphocytes and \"macrophage/dendritic\" cells, as well as endoneurial immunoglobulins, day 15 p.i. Later partial functional recovery occurred in parallel with the disappearance of T-cells. The degree of functional deficits thus correlated with the number of endoneurial T-lymphocytes. T-cells may, directly or indirectly, initiate several of the disease components in experimental allergic neuritis, including the nerve conduction deficit.\r"

P. carinii pneumonitis did not develop in any of 92 patients receiving the drug daily (30,602 patient-days) or in any of 74 who received it three consecutive days a week (27,329 patient-days), whereas the incidence of the infection expected without prophylaxis is 21 percent. One patient, excluded from both groups because of an adverse reaction to sulfonamides in the past, acquired P. carinii pneumonitis. Especially noteworthy was a difference in the occurrence of systemic mycoses, with 10 cases in the daily-treatment group and only 1 case in the three-days-a-week group (P = 0.024). No differences were observed in the rates of other infections or adverse effects associated with the drug. We conclude that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is as effective given three days a week as it is given daily in the prevention of P. carinii pneumonitis and that the intermittent schedule has the advantages of less frequent fungal infections and lower cost. Intermittent chemoprophylaxis may be especially beneficial to certain patients who are unable to tolerate the daily doses.\r"

  ".W": "Using 1983 data on 3720 nonfederal short-term hospitals, we analyzed the influence of local market competition and state regulatory programs on the availability of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary-artery bypass surgery. The degree of competition for patients with heart disease was measured in terms of the number of hospitals in the local market area that maintained a cardiac catheterization laboratory or facility for open-heart surgery. When the patient case mix and the hospital's teaching role were controlled for, institutions with more than 20 competitors in the local area were 166 percent more likely to offer coronary angioplasty (P less than 0.0001) and 147 percent more likely to offer bypass surgery (P less than 0.0001) than hospitals with no competitors in the local market. Four fifths of the hospitals performing bypass surgery whose annual volume was less than 200 had one or more neighboring hospitals with a facility for open-heart surgery. State rate-regulation programs in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Maryland significantly reduced the availability of both procedures, with the greatest regulatory effects being observed in the most competitive hospital markets. We conclude that in the period under consideration, competition encouraged and regulation discouraged the proliferation of these cardiac services.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) reproduces certain clinical, pathological, and neurochemical features of Parkinson's disease. MPTP is metabolized by monoamine oxidase Type B to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+), which is selectively accumulated by high-affinity uptake mechanisms into dopaminergic neurons. Lyden et al. described low-affinity binding of MPTP to synthetic and retinal melanin. We showed that MPP+ binds to neuromelanin with high affinity, suggesting that in MPTP neurotoxicity, MPP+ enters nigral neurons by the dopamine uptake system and binds to neuromelanin, which serves as a depot, continuously releasing MPP+ until it destroys the cells. This model predicts that agents which compete with MPP+ binding to neuromelanin should partially protect the dopamine neurons from MPTP-induced toxicity. The most potent identified competitor for MPP+ binding to melanin is the antimalarial drug chloroquine, which has a high affinity for melanins. In the present study, chloroquine, administered to monkeys in conventional anti-malarial doses before MPTP, protects them from MPTP-induced parkinsonian motor abnormalities, dopamine depletion in the striatum, and neuropathological changes in the substantia nigra.\r"

  ".W": "Only a small proportion of the vertebrate genome codes for proteins. It would therefore be useful if genes, and in particular the sites at which transcription begins, could be identified in libraries of cloned DNA. Since many known vertebrate genes have distinctive sequences (HTF-islands) surrounding their transcription start sites, we wished to be able to select these sequences easily and to find out how diagnostic they are for genes. HTF-islands contain a high density of non-methylated CpG (ref. 2) and can be detected in chromosomal DNA as clustered sites for certain rare-cutting (C-G) restriction enzymes. Identification of islands in chromosomal DNA is aided by methylation which blocks C-G enzyme sites in non-island DNA. This advantage is lost in cloned DNA, where CpG methylation is absent. We have calculated, however, that even in cloned DNA most sites for certain C-G enzymes should occur in HTF-islands. We tested this prediction using the enzyme SacII and found that four out of four sites in separate cosmids from the human X chromosome were located in HTF-islands. Hybridization to Northern blots provided preliminary evidence that three of the islands were associated with genes.\r"

The transforming growth factors (TGF-alpha) are related to the EGF family both in sequence and activity and EGF-like sequences are often observed in a wide range of functionally unrelated proteins. Attempts to examine the structure of EGF by diffraction methods have not yet succeeded because of difficulties with crystallization. We report here a three-dimensional structure of a biologically active derivative (residues 1-48) of the 53-residue human EGF. An analysis of high resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra was used together with a combination of distance geometry, restrained energy minimization and restrained molecular dynamics methods. The three-dimensional structure provides a basis for understanding the properties of EGFs and for predicting the structures of homologous sequences in other proteins.\r"

Epidemiological, clinical, entomological and serological studies of African onchocerciasis led to the hypothesis that Onchocerca volvulus exists in different forms in the forest and savannah. It is uncertain if these differences are due to genetic differences within O. volvulus itself, or to epigenetic factors, such as differences in the host populations. To date no basic biochemical differences between the forest and savannah populations of O. volvulus has been found, although isoenzyme studies have shown that differences in allele frequency between forest and savannah populations exist. Here we describe the isolation of a DNA sequence that seems to be specific for the forest form of O. volvulus, the first indication of a basic genetic difference between the savannah and forest forms.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is a labile humoral agent which mediates the action of some vasodilators. Nitrovasodilators, which may act by releasing nitric oxide (NO), mimic the effect of EDRF and it has recently been suggested by Furchgott that EDRF may be NO. We have examined this suggestion by studying the release of EDRF and NO from endothelial cells in culture. No was determined as the chemiluminescent product of its reaction with ozone. The biological activity of EDRF and of NO was measured by bioassay. The relaxation of the bioassay tissues induced by EDRF was indistinguishable from that induced by NO. Both substances were equally unstable. Bradykinin caused concentration-dependent release of NO from the cells in amounts sufficient to account for the biological activity of EDRF. The relaxations induced by EDRF and NO were inhibited by haemoglobin and enhanced by superoxide dismutase to a similar degree. Thus NO released from endothelial cells is indistinguishable from EDRF in terms of biological activity, stability, and susceptibility to an inhibitor and to a potentiator. We suggest that EDRF and NO are identical.\r"

In the present investigation of these three disorders, we demonstrated decreased levels of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)-like immunoreactivity in the frontal, temporal, and occipital poles of the neocortex. Moreover, reductions in peptidergic immunoreactivity correlated with reductions in the activity of choline acetyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of acetylcholine. The reduction in cortical CRF levels may be due to abnormalities of intrinsic cortical neurons or to dysfunction in neurons that contain CRF and innervate cortex.\r"

A direct fluorescence microscopic method revealed that the compound accumulated in the neurons. Electronmicroscopy showed degeneration of these cells, beginning in the nucleolus and the nucleus. Doxorubicin injected around sensory nerve terminals appears to be a useful compound for selective destruction of mouse sensory neurons. Retrograde axonal transport of neurotoxic compounds is probably an important pathogenetic mechanism in certain forms of intoxication which give rise to lesions in the nervous system.\r"

I consider here the first consecutive 31 patients treated. All these patients had perforating injuries of the lens and still localized lens damage; they showed no spontaneous healing tendencies. Successful treatment of lens capsule wounds, where an otherwise clear lens is locally scarred, has been rare. The technique described here was effective in more than 50% of the patients with anterior lens capsule lesions. Removal of degenerated lens cortex matter before fibrinogen application further improved the healing rate. The healing rate was low, however, in through-and-through perforations of the lens when the posterior lesion was not treated at all (of 11 cases, 1 success, 10 traumatic cataracts). It was not much better when the posterior lesion was approached via a basal iridectomy and around the lens equator (of 4 cases, 1 success). But translental fibrinogen application, following the foreign body pathway, together with removal of degenerated cortex matter from the anterior and posterior capsule lesion area, resulted in the prevention of traumatic cataract in all 4 patients treated so far. There were no undesirable local or systemic side-reactions. (Intraocular complications could be avoided by not exceeding the recommended amount of fibrinogen concentrate, 0.01-0.02 ml). The case histories of 3 patients are shown in three photographs.\r"

In addition, immunoelectron microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IRBP were performed. Immunohistochemical staining disclosed the most pronounced labeling of tumor cells with NSE and IRBP antibodies. A correlation was found between the degree of tumor differentiation and amount of IRBP, a protein specifically synthesized by photoreceptor cells. Moderate labeling of the better differentiated tumors was also observed with antibodies against S-Ag and focal labeling in a few tumors with opsin antibodies. Anti-GFAP labeling was limited to a smaller number of reactive glial cells and perivascular glial cells. These data indicate the essential neuronal nature of retinoblastoma tumor cells in situ as well as at least partial photoreceptor-like features, as shown by the presence of recognized photoreceptor cell markers (IRBP, S-Ag, opsin). Tissue culture studies using the human Y-79 retinoblastoma cell line also demonstrate that the tumor cells are primitive multipotential retinoblasts capable of at least partial differentiation along neuronal, glial, or pigment epithelial cell lines.\r"

The visual prognosis was poor, with only 22% of patients retaining 20/400 or better vision. This level of vision was achieved in 2 of 22 (9%) bacterial cases and in four of five (80%) fungal cases. Retinal detachment (5 cases) or retinal breaks (2 cases) at the time of the initial injury had a uniformly poor visual prognosis. Postoperative retinal detachment not associated with phthisis bulbi occurred in five eyes, three of which had successful retinal reattachment surgery. Delayed onset retinal detachment after successful initial management of traumatic endophthalmitis had a greater frequency of successful retinal reattachment surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Ganciclovir is a new antiviral compound (also called BW B759U, DHPG, BIOLF-62, and 2'NDG) that has been used for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinopathy in immunocompromised patients (bone marrow recipients or acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS] victims). The authors studied the eyes of three AIDS patients with CMV retinopathy who died while receiving ganciclovir chemotherapy. Gross, microscopic, and ultrastructural studies of these cases showed varying degrees of retinal scarring and active CMV lesions at the margins of the scars. CMV antigens were localized in cells at all layers of retina at the border of the lesions and in isolated cells in a perivascular location within histologically normal appearing retina. These areas probably represent sites of recrudescence when the drug is discontinued. In situ hybridization using a cloned complementary DNA (cDNA) probe of human CMV corroborated the immunocytologic localization of the virus. Ultrastructural studies showed megalic syncytial cells containing mostly capsids exclusively in the cell nucleus. The cytoplasmic electron-dense membrane-bound bodies that have characterized untreated cases of CMV retinopathy were absent in the treated cases. An attempt to isolate CMV in tissue culture from the vitreous and retina of one of the cases yielded a negative result. Our results indicate that ganciclovir does not effectively eliminate CMV from the retina nor does it suppress expression of all viral genes. Ganciclovir appears to function by limiting viral DNA synthesis and subsequent packaging of viral DNA into infectious units, thereby acting as a virostatic chemotherapeutic agent.\r"

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis developed in 18 of these patients; they were treated with ganciclovir. Five other patients with CMV retinitis who were not part of the prospective study were also treated with ganciclovir. CMV retinitis frequently involved the peripheral retina. All 23 patients treated with ganciclovir showed clinical regression of retinitis, although breakthrough recurrence of CMV retinitis occurred in seven patients (30.4%) while on maintenance therapy with ganciclovir. During treatment, neutropenia (less than 1000 leukocytes/mm3) developed in three patients (13%). Ganciclovir is an effective means of therapy for CMV retinitis, but it must be given chronically to prevent reactivation. Breakthrough recurrences while on maintenance therapy are not uncommon, but can be successfully treated with more aggressive treatment with ganciclovir. In addition, the prognosis for survival of AIDS patients being treated with ganciclovir is improved when compared with that of untreated patients.\r"

Three vaccinations at 2, 4 and 6 months of age with diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-whole cell pertussis had been administered previously. Adverse effects occurred more frequently with the diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-whole cell pertussis than with diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis vaccine. Fever occurred significantly more often and to a higher degree in the whole cell pertussis vaccine recipients with a peak difference occurring 6 hours after immunization (P = 0.00008). Local swelling, redness, warmth and tenderness at the injection site also occurred significantly more frequently following whole cell pertussis vaccination. No major sequelae were noted in either group. The antibody responses to lymphocytosis-promoting factor were similar for the two vaccines. The diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis vaccine produced significantly lower pertussis agglutinin titers (P = 0.00001) but significantly higher antibody to filamentous hemagglutinin (P = 0.05) and to diphtheria (P = 0.03). The protective role of antibody to pertussis agglutinins vs. filamentous hemagglutinin and lymphocytosis-promoting factor continues as a central issue in the quest for a new pertussis vaccine. A clinical efficacy trial is needed.\r"

However, the incidence of primary Hib disease and recurrent disease are not excessive in non-Native children in Alaska (mainly Caucasian). Twelve recurrent cases in Alaskan Natives were studied, 10 of which were detected in surveillance activities between 1971 and 1984. These recurrent episodes occurred 23 to 197 days after the initial episodes (median, 51 days); the overall rate of recurrent disease was 3.5%. The ages of the patients with recurrent disease were significantly younger than single episode cases. To determine if disease recurrence was a manifestation of the high disease incidence and earlier age at onset of disease, we calculated an expected number of recurrent cases for our study population, based on the incidence observed in children with first episodes and the period of observed follow-up. The expected number of recurrent cases was only 1.9, significantly fewer than the 10 observed, indicating that age and the high incidence of disease alone were not the only factors contributing to the recurrent disease. No other significant clinical or epidemiologic risk factors could be identified. Patients who develop recurrent invasive Hib disease may represent a subset of this population with unusual disease susceptibility.\r"

Using these probes, we isolated several cDNA clones from lambda gt10 libraries of fetal brain and liver origins. These include 2.4-kilobase cDNA clones that code for a polypeptide containing a putative signal peptide and the N-terminal, active site, and C-terminal peptides of human BtChoEase, suggesting that they code either for BtChoEase itself or for a very similar but distinct fetal form of cholinesterase. In RNA blots of poly(A)+ RNA from the cholinesterase-producing fetal brain and liver, these cDNAs hybridized with a single 2.5-kilobase band. Blot hybridization to human genomic DNA revealed that these fetal BtChoEase cDNA clones hybridize with DNA fragments of the total length of 17.5 kilobases, and signal intensities indicated that these sequences are not present in many copies. Both the cDNA-encoded protein and its nucleotide sequence display striking homology to parallel sequences published for Torpedo AcChoEase. These findings demonstrate extensive homologies between the fetal BtChoEase encoded by these clones and other cholinesterases of various forms and species.\r"

We have cloned the gene encoding calmodulin from the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, by using synthetic oligonucleotide probes that correspond to three distinct regions of Tetrahymena calmodulin. A 1.6-kilobase (kb) DNA fragment that hybridized to all of them contains a gene whose deduced product possesses 74% amino acid homology with bovine calmodulin. This gene, which is unique in the S. pombe genome and is named cam1, encodes 149 amino acids excluding the first methionine and is transcribed into mRNA of 1.2-kb length. It has an intron that apparently starts immediately after the initiation codon and is 126 bp long. S. pombe calmodulin exhibits more homology to vertebrate calmodulin than to that of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Gene disruption experiments revealed that cam1 gene function is essential for vegetative growth of S. pombe. Spores bearing disrupted cam1 halt growth soon after germination and rarely carry out the first cell division, indicating that calmodulin does not exist in excess in those cells.\r"

The deduced amino acid sequence contains 718 amino acid residues (Mr, 76,964), and the mature protein corresponds to the deduced sequence from the 80th residue of the primary translation product (resultant Mr, 68,113). This deduced molecular weight is significantly lower than that determined by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting the possibility that the inhibitor is post-translationally modified. The sequence of the mature inhibitor contains four consecutive internal repeats approximately 140 amino acid residues long, each of which might be responsible for the inhibitory activity. Calpastatin is apparently different from a typical cysteine protease inhibitor (cystatin), suggesting that the mechanism of inhibition of calcium-dependent cysteine protease by the inhibitor might be different from that of other cysteine proteases by cystatin.\r"

  ".W": "A peptide secreted by some tumor cells in vitro imparts anchorage-independent growth to normal rat kidney (NRK) cells and has been termed transforming growth factor type alpha (TGF-alpha). To directly investigate the transforming properties of this factor, the human sequence coding for TGF-alpha was placed under the control of either a metallothionein promoter or a retroviral long terminal repeat. These constructs failed to induce morphological transformation upon transfection of NIH 3T3 cells, whereas viral oncogenes encoding a truncated form of its cognate receptor, the EGF receptor, or another growth factor, sis/platelet-derived growth factor 2, efficiently induced transformed foci. When NIH 3T3 clonal sublines were selected by transfection of TGF-alpha expression vectors in the presence of a dominant selectable marker, they were shown to secrete large amounts of TGF-alpha into the medium, to have downregulated EGF receptors, and to be inhibited in growth by TGF-alpha monoclonal antibody. These results indicated that secreted TGF-alpha interacts with its receptor at a cell surface location. Single cell-derived TGF-alpha-expressing sublines grew to high saturation density in culture. However, when plated as single cells on contact-inhibited monolayers of NIH 3T3 cells, they failed to form colonies, whereas v-sis- and v-erbB-transfected cells formed transformed colonies under the same conditions. Moreover, TGF-alpha-expressing sublines were not tumorigenic in nude mice. These and other results imply that TGF-alpha exerts a growth-promoting effect on the entire NIH 3T3 cell population after secretion into the medium but little, if any, effect on the individual cell synthesizing this factor. It is concluded that the normal coding sequence for TGF-alpha is not a direct-acting oncogene when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells.\r"

Spleen and peritoneal macrophages produced IL-1 mRNA and released biologically active IL-1 when challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Induction of IL-1 was evident over a dose range of 0.01-10 micrograms of LPS per ml, and maximal mRNA levels were maintained from 4 to 20 hr. Several other stimuli did not induce IL-1 in cultured macrophages, including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, gamma-interferon, Con A, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-3, cachectin, and activated T cells. Activated T cells could markedly reduce the response of peritoneal macrophages to LPS. When other cell types were compared with macrophages, keratinocytes had high levels of IL-1 mRNA, apparently in response to endogenous LPS. However B and T lymphocytes did not yield detectable IL-1 during proliferative responses to LPS and Con A, respectively, while dendritic cells produced little or no IL-1 when challenged with a battery of stimuli. Therefore, IL-1 may not be required for the potent accessory function of dendritic cells in lymphocyte mitogenesis. The results indicate that macrophages and dendritic cells have different secretory capacities. The macrophage is the principal leukocyte that synthesizes IL-1, and select stimuli increase and decrease the levels of macrophage IL-1 mRNA.\r"

Oligonucleotide probes derived from this sequence permitted isolation of 5' cDNA and genomic fragments coding for gp96. Three short exons interrupted by relatively long introns were identified at the 5' terminus of the gp96 gene. The first exon encodes a signal peptide, which is consistent with gp96 being a cell surface antigen. Southern blot analysis indicated that the gp96 family is encoded by a single gene, and 3-kilobase transcripts were detected in all normal and tumor cells tested. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences from 311 base paris at the 5' terminus showed no homology with any known protein. The availability of molecular probes for the gp96 system permits analysis of the structural polymorphism of these antigens.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of helper T cells directed against trinitrophenyl-modified syngeneic spleen cells to recognize low-hapten densities on target cells is under major histocompatibility complex-linked Ir gene control. Thus, BALB/c (H-2d) mice are low responders while H-2 congenic BALB.C3H (H-2k) mice are high responders. Immunization of adult BALB/c mice with the monoclonal antibody F6(51), directed to shared idiotopes by anti-trinitrophenyl antibodies and clonal receptors on anti-trinitrophenyl-self helper T cells, leads to the production of high titers of circulating idiotype, has no influence on helper T cell idiotypic profiles, but shifts to a high-responder phenotype the ability of helper T cells to recognize low-hapten densities. These effects on Ir gene phenotype are even more striking in untreated progenies from F6(51)-immunized BALB/c females, which are better responders than genetically high-responder BALB.C3H mice, although completely different in the expression of the F6(51)-defined clonotype. The general significance of these findings on Ir gene-directed T-cell repertoire selection is discussed, for they constitute formal evidence against antigen-presentation as a mechanism of Ir gene effects and strong support for the importance of maternal influences on the development of T-cell repertoires.\r"

  ".W": "T-cell lines were derived from ferredoxin nonresponder B10.D2 mice that share an idiotype expressed by a monoclonal antibody (Fd-B2) with specificity for one of the two major antigenic determinants (the C determinant) of the antigen. The T-cell line and T-cell clones derived from it release interleukin 2 not only in the presence of anti-Fd-B2 idiotype antibody but in the presence of ferredoxin. The line was shown to be major histocompatibility complex-restricted in that it would respond to the anti-idiotype and antigen only in the context of presentation by cells of the H-2d haplotype. This observation also establishes that the nonresponder status of H-2d animals cannot be attributed to a lesion at the level of antigen presentation. Analysis of the fine specificity of one idiotypic clone showed that it responded only to the anti-idiotype or products of the antigen containing the C determinant, since enzymatically degraded peptides devoid of this determinant did not stimulate these cells. Furthermore, it was found that presentation of both the antigen and the anti-idiotype to the specific clone could be blocked by the Fd-B2 monoclonal antibody.\r"

In the case of adult thymocytes, IL-4 in combination with Con A or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated the proliferation of peanut agglutinin (PNA)-negative (-) thymocytes, while PNA-positive (+) thymocytes showed only marginal responses. Further investigation revealed that day 14-17 fetal thymocytes, purified L3T4- LyT2- double-negative adult thymocytes, and single positive L3T4+ LyT2- or L3T4- LyT2+ thymocytes failed to respond to IL-4 or PMA alone but proliferated strongly with both IL-4 and PMA. In contrast, purified double-positive L3T4+ LyT2+ adult thymocytes showed only a marginal proliferative response to these stimuli. Responsiveness of thymic subpopulations to PMA and IL-4 could be inhibited with anti-IL-4 but not with anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibodies, indicating that they were IL-2 independent. Finally, we have observed that supernatants from calcium ionophore and PMA-stimulated adult double-negative L3T4- LyT2- thymocytes induce proliferation of double-negative adult thymocytes. This latter response is inhibited by anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibodies, suggesting that under appropriate stimulation conditions, these immature thymocytes are able to produce IL-4. These observations suggest a role for IL-4 in T-cell ontogeny.\r"

Lactoferrin was used to enhance detection of the stimulating effects of exogenously administered CSFs. Concentrations of CSFs that were not active in vivo when given alone were active when administered together with other types of CSF. The concentrations of CSF-1, IL-3, and GM-CSF needed to increase progenitor cell cycling rates were reduced by factors of 40-200, 10-50, and 40- greater than 400, respectively; the concentrations needed to increase progenitor cell numbers were reduced by factors of 40-500 (CSF-1), 20-80 (IL-3), and greater than 40- greater than 200 (GM-CSF) when these forms of CSFs were administered in combination with low dosages of one of the other forms of CSFs. The results demonstrate that different CSFs can synergize when administered in vivo to increase the cycling rates and numbers of marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells. These findings may be of relevance physiologically to the regulation of myeloid blood cell production by CSFs.\r"

The anti-Id nature of HF1.7 was demonstrated by the following properties. (i) It reacted in a solid-phase immunoassay with anti-Leu-3a and not with a panel of irrelevant mouse mAbs. (ii) It partially inhibited the binding of anti-Leu-3a to CD4+ T cells. (iii) It detected a common idiotype present on various anti-CD4 mAbs. Because the CD4 molecule represents the receptor site for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the etiologic viral agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, we examined the ability of the anti-mAb HF1.7 to mimic CD4 and bind HIV. This anti-Id mAb reacted with HIV antigens in commercial HIV ELISAs and recognized HIV-infected human T cells but not uninfected cells when analyzed by flow cytofluorometry. Attesting further to the HIV specificity, the anti-Id mAb reacted with a recombinant gp160 peptide and a molecule of Mr 110,000-120,000 in immunoblot analysis of HIV-infected cell lysates. The anti-Id mAb also partially neutralized HIV infection of human T cells in vitro. These results strongly suggest that this anti-Id mAb mimics the CD4 antigenic determinants involved in binding to HIV.\r"

In this context, VZV could be useful as a vector for vaccinating against other infectious agents as well. As an initial application, a live recombinant VZV expressing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) membrane glycoproteins (gp350/220) was generated by inserting a gene fusion of the VZV gpI promoter and hydrophobic leader-encoding sequence with the gp350/220 coding sequence into the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of VZV (Oka). Insertion of the foreign DNA into the thymidine kinase gene was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis and the ability of the recombinant virus to replicate in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine. RNA splicing, glycosylation, and plasma membrane presentation of gp350/220 in cells infected with the recombinant virus were similar to those seen in EBV-infected cells. In addition, the expression of VZV-specific glycoproteins was unaltered by the concomitant expression of this large foreign glycoprotein. Thus, VZV can be used as a live viral vector for active immunization against EBV and other pathogens.\r"

Automated Edman degradation in a gas-phase sequencer showed the major N-terminus of the human low molecular weight protein to be Phe-Pro-Ile-Pro-Leu-Pro-Tyr-Cys-Trp-Leu-Cys-Arg-Ala-Leu-. Because of the N-terminal phenylalanine, the surfactant protein was designated SPL(Phe). Antiserum generated against hydrophobic surfactant protein(s) from bovine pulmonary surfactant recognized protein of Mr 6000-14,000 in immunoblot analysis and was used to screen a lambda gt11 expression library constructed from adult human lung poly(A)+ RNA. This resulted in identification of a 1.4-kilobase cDNA clone that was shown to encode the N-terminus of the surfactant polypeptide SPL(Phe) (Phe-Pro-Ile-Pro-Leu-Pro-) within an open reading frame for a larger protein. Expression of a fused beta-galactosidase-SPL(Phe) gene in Escherichia coli yielded an immunoreactive Mr 34,000 fusion peptide. Hybrid-arrested translation with this cDNA and immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translation products of human poly(A)+ RNA with a surfactant polyclonal antibody resulted in identification of a Mr 40,000 precursor protein. Blot hybridization analysis of electrophoretically fractionated RNA from human lung detected a 2.0-kilobase RNA that was more abundant in adult lung than in fetal lung. The larger RNA and translation product indicates that SPL(Phe) is derived by proteolysis of a large polypeptide precursor. The amino acid sequence of the predicted protein, beginning Phe-Pro-Ile-Pro-Leu-Pro-Try-, comprises a hydrophobic peptide that is a major protein component of surfactant lipid extracts used successfully to treat hyaline membrane disease in newborn infants. These proteins, and specifically SPL(Phe), may therefore be useful for synthesis of replacement surfactants for treatment of hyaline membrane disease in newborn infants or of other surfactant-deficient states.\r"

Definition of the primary structure of MCAD and the tissue distribution of its mRNA is of biochemical and clinical importance because of the recent recognition of inherited MCAD deficiency in humans. The MCAD mRNA nucleotide sequence was determined from two overlapping cDNA clones isolated from human liver and placental cDNA libraries, respectively. The MCAD mRNA includes a 1263-base-pair coding region and a 738-base-pair 3'-nontranslated region. A partial amino acid sequence (137 residues) determined on peptides derived from MCAD purified from porcine liver confirmed the identity of the cDNA clone. Comparison of the amino acid sequence predicted from the human MCAD cDNA with the partial protein sequence of the porcine MCAD revealed a high degree (88%) of interspecies sequence identity. RNA blot analysis shows that MCAD mRNA is expressed in a variety of rat (2.2 kilobases) and human (2.4 kilobases) tissues. Blot hybridization of RNA prepared from cultured skin fibroblasts from a patient with MCAD deficiency disclosed that mRNA was present and of similar size to MCAD mRNA derived from control fibroblasts. The isolation and characterization of MCAD cDNA is an important step in the definition of the defect underlying MCAD deficiency and in understanding its metabolic consequences.\r"

Direct measurements showed that nonspecific ATP degradation during the assay did not account for the high ATP requirement. 5'-Adenylyl imidodiphosphate (p[NH]ppA), an ATP analog with a nonhydrolyzable beta-gamma bond, was unable to substitute for ATP in supporting mtDNA transcription but greatly stimulated this transcription in the presence of a low concentration of exogenous ATP. Evidence was obtained indicating that p[NH]ppA did not support an early event in mtDNA transcription (formation of preinitiation complex or initiation), whereas this analog could substitute effectively for ATP in the subsequent elongation steps. These results pointed to a specific requirement for ATP at an early step of the transcription process.\r"

Southern blots showed that homologous genes are present in the genomic DNA of humans, rabbits, sheep, hamsters, and mice, suggesting that this gene has been conserved through mammalian evolution.

Lyt-3 is expressed as a heterodimer with Lyt-2, and this complex is considered to be a homologue of the human Leu-2/T8 (CD8) that has been postulated to be a receptor for the class I major histocompatibility complex. We have determined the complete primary structure of Lyt-3 from the nucleotide sequence of its cDNA clones. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence indicates that the Lyt-3 polypeptide has a 21-amino acid leader peptide, and the mature protein consists of an NH2-terminal region of 146 amino acids, a transmembrane region of 27 residues, and a C-terminal region of 19 amino acids. The NH2-terminal 110 residues show clear homology to the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin variable region sequences. In addition, Lyt-3 has 11 residues that have strong homology to the joining region sequences of the T-cell receptor and the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. The presence of immunoglobulin variable- as well as joining-region-related sequences in Lyt-3 further supports the idea that these molecules may be recognition molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin super gene family.\r"

  ".W": "In search of a phenotypic marker determining genetically controlled susceptibility to delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions in the brain--in particular, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)--we have compared the gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) induction of Ia molecules on astrocytes and macrophages from rat and mouse strains that are susceptible or resistant to this disease. We focused on Ia expression because DTH reactions to self or foreign antigens are largely mediated by lymphocytes restricted by class II (Ia) antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Our data demonstrate that Lewis (fully susceptible) and Brown Norway (BN) (fully resistant) rats are very different in that Lewis astrocytes express much higher levels of Ia than BN astrocytes. Similar data were obtained from an analysis of EAE-susceptible and -resistant mouse strains (SJL and BALB/c, respectively), which suggests that this phenomenon may be universal and not limited to only one mammalian species. At least one gene responsible for Ia hyperinduction is located outside the rat RT-1 or the mouse MHC locus. Animals congenic at the RT-1 or MHC locus of the resistant strain but with background genes of the susceptible strain exhibit intermediate levels of Ia compared to fully resistant and susceptible rodents, which fits well with the reduced EAE susceptibility of these congenic animals. Furthermore, hyperinduction of Ia is astrocyte specific, since peritoneal macrophages of susceptible and resistant strains exhibit identical profiles of Ia induction. Thus, astrocyte Ia hyperinducibility may be a major strain- and tissue-specific factor that contributes to Ia-restricted DTH reactions in the brain.\r"

The gene was mapped within a 190-kilobase Not I restriction fragment located in the telomeric portion of the human major histocompatibility complex. Distinct features of the gene include the structure of the promoter, the position of the translation initiation site, a frameshift mutation at the carboxyl terminus, the insertion of an Alu repeat element in the eighth exon, divergence in the derived amino acid sequence, and the lack of expression of the gene in some cells.\r"

  ".W": "We describe an interleukin, termed interleukin 5, that is the recombinant product previously referred to as T-cell-replacing factor (TRF), B-cell growth factor II (BCGF II), or killer-helper factor (KHF). TRF has been defined as a T-cell-derived lymphokine that acts on activated B cells as a B-cell differentiation factor. We have previously demonstrated that TRF is identical to BCGF II and induces expression of receptors for interleukin 2 (IL-2) on activated B cells. We also have reported that KHF can induce not only expression of IL-2 receptors on peanut agglutinin-binding (PNA+) thymocytes but also generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in PNA+ thymocytes in the presence of IL-2. We show here that culture supernatants of T-cell hybridomas that produce TRF as well as TRF purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC-TRF) have KHF activity and generate CTL in PNA+ thymocytes in the presence of stimulator cells and IL-2. Moreover, translation products (recombinant TRF) of Xenopus oocytes injected with cDNA encoding for murine TRF (BCGF II) also exert KHF activity. A rat monoclonal anti-TRF antibody TB13 can block generation of CTL by HPLC-TRF or recombinant TRF. These results indicate that TRF acts not only on B cells as BCGF II but also on PNA+ thymocytes as KHF. In view of the diverse activities and targets of TRF, we propose that TRF refers to a different interleukin, interleukin 5.\r"

  ".U": "87231981\r", 
  ".W": "RNK-16 cells, rat leukemia cells with features of natural killer (NK) cells, were adapted for growth in vitro and used to examine the mechanism of NK-cell activation. Contact of RNK-16 cells with tumor cells (YAC-1) that are lysed by NK cells, but not with resistant tumor cells (EL-4, K562), led to an increase in inositol trisphosphate (InsP3), a Ca2+-mobilizing messenger. A similar increase in InsP3 could be elicited in RNK-16 cells by monoclonal antibody OX-34, when the antibody was crosslinked by F(ab')2 fragments of goat antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin. This reaction was accompanied by an increase in the concentration of cytoplasmic free calcium Ca2+, due primarily to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. In contrast to the stimulatory effects of crosslinked OX-34, OX-34 alone did not affect the levels of either InsP3 or cytoplasmic free Ca2+. Moreover, OX-34 alone blocked the generation of InsP3 by RNK-16 cells in response to YAC-1 cells and prevented target-cell killing. These findings demonstrate that OX-34 identifies a structure on the surface of RNK-16 cells that can stimulate the generation of InsP3, and they suggest that this structure can regulate signal transduction during target-cell recognition by NK cells.\r"

  ".U": "87231982\r", 
  ".W": "We developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) (9D7) against a synthetic peptide (P13K) selected from the deduced amino acid sequence of the constant region of the gamma chain of the murine T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) (amino acids 118-130). Using this mAb, we identified a putative second TCR expressed on peripheral blood lymphocytes from a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) that were propagated in culture with recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2) and Con A. This mAb immunoprecipitated two polypeptide chains of 40 and 58 kDa under nonreducing conditions and of 40 and 56 kDa under reducing conditions from 125I-labeled denatured lysates of T3+ WT31- lymphocytes expanded in culture from a SCID patient. These polypeptide chains were not disulfide linked and were not present on human peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal donors cultured for 5 days with phytohemagglutinin or for 2 weeks with rIL-2 and polyclonal activators or on cells of the Jurkat lymphoblastoid human T-cell line. Chemical crosslinking of 125I-labeled cells followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Leu-4 mAb under nonreducing or reducing conditions revealed that the 40- and 56-kDa polypeptide chains were associated with the T3 differentiation antigen. These results were confirmed by sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-Leu-4 mAb followed by 9D7 anti-P13K mAb. The 9D7 anti-P13K mAb immunoprecipitated two polypeptide chains of 43 and 64 kDa from denatured lysates of lymphocytes from a patient with severe common variable immunodeficiency (CVI) that were expanded in culture with rIL-2 and Con A. Thus, this second TCR may be composed of two polypeptide chains (gamma gamma'), both of which appear to be the product of the gamma-chain gene. These experiments were done with polyclonal cell populations. Cloned T3+ WT31- cell populations are required to determine whether this TCR contains two gamma polypeptide chains. In contrast, only one polypeptide chain of 56 kDa was immunoprecipitated by the 9D7 anti-P13K mAb from peripheral blood lymphocytes from a patient with mild CVI expanded in culture with rIL-2 and polyclonal activators. Using the same 9D7 anti-P13K mAb and immunoblotting analysis, we identified a 35 kDa gamma-chain polypeptide under reducing conditions expressed on purified L3T4- Lyt2- BALB/c mouse thymocytes. This gamma-chain TCR is disulfide linked and has a molecular mass of 80 kDa under nonreducing conditions.\r"

Recombinant DNA plasmids containing this DR alpha gene segment fused to the coding sequence of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene are expressed at higher levels in human B-cell lines than in human T-cell lines. We have demonstrated that the most 5' of the class II boxes is essential for tissue-specific DR alpha promoter function. In addition, using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to identify DNA binding proteins, we have detected binding of nuclear proteins to DNA probes containing the class II boxes and the octamer sequence. A protein that binds to the octamer is present at higher levels in nuclear extracts of B-cell lines than in other cell lines examined.

To investigate the manner in which the gag-initiated polyproteins of the mouse mammary tumor virus are produced, we determined the nucleotide sequence of a 1.8-kilobase DNA fragment that spans the region between gag and pol in the C3H strain of mouse mammary tumor virus. The sequence reveals three overlapping open reading frames: the first encodes products of gag (p27gag and p14gag); the second encodes a protein domain of unknown function (termed X) that is highly related to a similarly positioned sequence in simian type D retroviruses and the viral protease (pro); and the third encodes the reverse transcriptase. The reading frames are organized to permit uninterrupted readthrough from gag to pol if ribosomal frameshifts occur in the -1 direction within each of the two overlapping regions, one of which is 16 nucleotides in length and the other 13 nucleotides. Cell-free translation of RNA containing these overlap regions shows that fusion of the reading frames by ribosomal frameshifting occurs efficiently: about one-fourth of the ribosomes traversing the gag-X/pro overlap and one-tenth traversing the X/pro-pol overlap shift frames, generating gag-related polyproteins in ratios similar to those observed in vivo. Synthetic oligonucleotides containing either of the overlap regions inserted into novel contexts do not induce frameshifting; hence the overlapping portions of the reading frames are not sufficient to induce a frameshift event, and a larger sequence context or secondary structure may be implicated.\r"

Current and earlier studies have shown that 11 of the 12 open reading frames contained in the unique sequences of the S component can be deleted and are dispensable for growth in cell culture. Analyses of one recombinant virus containing a deletion in the open reading frame US7 permitted the identification of a monoclonal antibody specific for the product of this gene. The protein encoded by this gene has a predicted translated molecular weight of 41,366 and an apparent molecular weight of approximately 65,000 in denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The electrophoretic mobility of the protein synthesized by cells in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of tunicamycin is faster than that of the protein accumulating in lysates of untreated infected cells. We conclude that the product of US7 is glycoprotein subject to N-linked glycosylation, and we have designated it glycoprotein I. These studies indicate that the unique sequences of the S component encode four glycoproteins (G, D, I, and E) of which at least three (G, I, and E) are dispensable for growth in continuous lines of primate cells.\r"

In eight sites, both modalities were truly negative, but SPECT was negative in four additional sites that were equivocal on planar imaging, resulting in specificities of 0.66 and 1.00 for planar and SPECT imaging, respectively. In the abdomen, the sensitivities of planar and SPECT imaging were 0.69 and 0.85, and the specificities 0.87 and 1.00, respectively.

Other complications encountered were gastroduodenal ulcer, colitis, ileus, subphrenic abscess and intraperitoneal bleeding. Prolonged CPB and low output syndrome preceded multiple organ failure, which occurred in 39% of those who had abdominal complications and in 59% of those who bled. Gl bleeding after CPB did not correlate with a previous history of gastric ulcer. Reoperation because of cardiac tamponade or excessive chest tube drainage was a factor predisposing to Gl bleeding. The mortality and abdominal complication rates were significantly higher in valve surgery than in coronary revascularization.\r"

All 46 patients who survived the operation were followed up for a mean period of 31 months, and during that time there were nine deaths. The survival rate was 54% after 3 years and 40% after 5 years. Most of the patients had improved by at least one functional class.

Precisely how the products of the bcl-2 and c-myc genes contribute to tumorigenesis is unknown, but observations that c-myc expression is rapidly induced in nonneoplastic lymphocytes upon stimulation of proliferation raise the possibility that this proto-oncogene is involved in the control of normal cellular growth. In addition to c-myc, the bcl-2 proto-oncogene also was expressed in normal human B and T lymphocytes after stimulation with appropriate mitogens. Comparison of the regulation of the expression of these proto-oncogenes demonstrated marked differences and provided evidence that, in contrast to c-myc, levels of bcl-2 messenger RNA are regulated primarily through transcriptional mechanisms.\r"

Protein-DNA interactions in the 5' promoter region of a cell cycle-regulated human H4 histone gene have been analyzed at single-nucleotide resolution in vivo. This region contains two sites, with four potential protein-binding domains, at which the DNA is protected from reaction with dimethyl sulfate in cells and from digestion with deoxyribonuclease I in nuclei. These protein-DNA interactions persist during all phases of the cell cycle and dissociate with 0.16 to 0.2M sodium chloride.\r"

  ".U": "87234337\r", 
  ".W": "Increased levels of intracellular calcium at either pre- or postsynaptic sites are thought to precede changes in synaptic strength. Thus, to induce long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, periods of intense synaptic stimulation would have to transiently raise the levels of cytosolic calcium at postsynaptic sites--dendritic spines in the majority of cases. Since direct experimental verification of this hypothesis is not possible at present, calcium levels have been studied by numerically solving the appropriate electro-diffusion equations for two different postsynaptic structures. Under the assumption that voltage-dependent calcium channels are present on dendritic spines, free intracellular calcium in spines can reach micromolar levels after as few as seven spikes in 20 milliseconds. Moreover, a short, but high-frequency, burst of presynaptic activity is more effective in raising levels of calcium and especially of the calcium-calmodulin complex than sustained low-frequency activity. This behavior is different from that seen at the soma of a typical vertebrate neuron.\r"

Eight of these patients were taken from a group of 91 who underwent selective shunts from July 1983 through June 1985 and had extensive preoperative and postoperative evaluation of shunt patency and pressure gradient. Seven patients operated upon before July 1983 were reviewed because they illustrate the cause, diagnosis, successful and unsuccessful management of bleeding after selective shunt. Urgent selective arteriography combined with shunt catheterization is the key diagnostic and therapeutic maneuver. Thrombosis of the shunt can be successfully managed by revising the anastomosis. Stenosis of the shunt can be successfully treated with balloon dilation or operative revision of the anastomosis. When renal vein hypertension (RVH) occurs, there might be inadequate decompression of the varices. A gradient of 10 millimeters of mercury or greater from left renal vein to vena cava is diagnostic. Measurements of 30 patients who had no bleeding and one patient with documented RVH show the gradient decreases over time. Treatment should be supportive until this adaptation occurs. Hemorrhage can also occur in patients with a patient shunt but without a significant pressure gradient. Inadequate decompression of the varices through the short gastric veins leading to the spleen has been proposed as one cause. Termed short gastric hypertension, this syndrome could be expected to parallel RVH because the venous collaterals will enlarge and eventually decompress the varices. Treatment should be aimed toward supporting the patient until this adaptation occurs. A small number of patients continue to bleed despite these therapeutic interventions but can sometimes be salvaged with a total shunt.\r"

Morbidity occurred in 33% of the patients. Significant causes of morbidity and mortality were related to complications of the esophageal transection, which was omitted in the later series. Six of the eighteen patients who survived surgery died later, but only one death was due to presumed recurrent variceal hemorrhage. Significant bleeding occurred in four patients--two due to recurrent varices and two due to peptic ulcer disease. Encephalopathy, which was present preoperatively in two patients, is still manifest but is well controlled. Encephalopathy did not develop in any other patients.

We used a murine model of intraperitoneal cancer to demonstrate the augmentation of tumor growth by surgical trauma. In this intraperitoneal tumor model, a surgical procedure that included entry into the abdominal cavity resulted in augmented tumor growth; a surgical incision on the skin of the animal's back did not promote tumor growth. The immunotherapeutic effects of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells were significantly reduced by the performance of a laparotomy. This abrogation of the effects of the immunotherapeutic regimen was observed for up to 14 days after laparotomy but was lost by days 35 to 42. Healing tissue may promote tumor growth, and these effects are dominant over immunotherapy with interleukin-2 plus lymphokine-activated killer cells.\r"

Surgical removal of intraspinal synovial cysts implicated in the development of radiculopathy has resulted in symptomatic relief. A nonoperative method of treatment consists of CT-guided needle placement into the facet joint adjacent to the cyst, followed by injection of contrast material to show communication between the joint and the cyst and injection of corticosteroids. Three outpatients were treated in this fashion without complications. Complete relief of symptoms was achieved in two cases and partial relief was achieved in one. Follow-up CT scans performed 2 months after the procedure showed no change in the size of the cysts in two of the patients. A 6-month follow-up CT scan in the third patient, however, showed significant improvement in cyst size. These preliminary results suggest that this procedure is an alternative to surgical management of intraspinal synovial cysts.\r"

In four cases with metal objects and in seven with cast materials, there was no difficulty achieving adequate CT studies. In 13 cases CT was found to be helpful in determining bony union in the presence of advanced osteoporosis. In six cases CT was excellent in evaluating bone-graft incorporation. CT affords improved detection of fractures perpendicular to the plane of the scan and also shows small areas of bone disruption, even with osteoporosis. Axial CT images can evaluate Lister's tubercle, a bony prominence on the dorsum of the distal radius, for hypertrophy, which can occur secondary to traumatic and degenerative changes. A hypertrophied tubercle can impinge on the extensor pollicis longus tendon and cause atrophy and disruption. The high cost of CT is offset by the possibility of reducing the patient's period of immobilization and, thereby, the length of time the patient is unable to participate in normal activities. In addition, since CT is often definitive, the number of supplemental or follow-up radiologic procedures or clinical appointments should be reduced. We conclude that CT is useful in evaluating the results of treatment of wrist injuries.\r"

Each study included anteroposterior, transthoracic lateral, and scapular \"Y\" (60 degrees anterior oblique) views as well as the apical oblique projection. Radiographic evidence of injury detected on each view was recorded. The apical oblique view detected 153 (81%) of the 190 injuries. Twenty abnormalities were seen only in this view. These included 11 glenoid rim fractures, seven Hill-Sachs lesions, one posterior subluxation, and one case of soft-tissue calcification. Additional clinically useful information, such as fracture extension into the joint space and displacement of clavicular fracture fragments, was also uniquely provided in this view. The anteroposterior view was more effective than the apical oblique view in detecting acute shoulder injuries, showing 168 (88%) injuries. However, the two views were often complementary, and in this series, if only the anteroposterior and apical oblique views had been obtained, 188 of 190 injuries would have been seen. The results show that the apical oblique view is useful for the detection of shoulder injuries.\r"

The structure responsible for the teardrop is the anteroinferior portion of the acetabular fossa with contributions from the ischium and from the superior pubic ramus. Anteroposterior pelvic radiographs of 10 patients with documented cases of unilateral hip effusion were retrospectively evaluated for teardrop distance widening on the affected side. Proof of the presence of hip effusion was based on the results of percutaneous hip joint aspirations as described in the patient's medical records. A teardrop distance widening of 1 mm or more was always consistent with hip joint fluid. In addition, radiographs from 20 patients with no known hip abnormalities were reviewed as a control population. These showed side-to-side symmetry in 16 cases (80%) and widening of less than 1 mm in the remaining four cases (20%). Thus, hip joint effusion in adults can be accurately diagnosed from plain radiographs in the presence of a teardrop asymmetry of 1 mm or more and in the absence of degenerative joint disease.\r"

Retrospective review of CT scans of 24 intraarticular calcaneal fractures, obtained shortly after injury, identified 22 cases (92%) of acute peroneal tendon abnormalities. In most of these cases, multiple findings were present. These included lateral displacement in 14 (58%) of 24, impingement by bony fragments in eight (33%), subluxation or dislocation in six (25%), soft-tissue masses around the tendons representing hematomas or early scar tissue in five (21%), and entrapment of the tendons in three (13%). In 10 cases with long-term follow-up, impingement on the tendons by bony fragments correlated well with the subsequent development of peroneal tenosynovitis, while hematoma around the tendons or lateral displacement of the tendons was clinically insignificant. Thus, CT in the immediate postfracture period, can be used to detect and categorize acute peroneal tendon injuries as well as possibly to predict the likelihood and nature of subsequent development of peroneal tenosynovitis.\r"

  ".W": "Because of its sensitivity to fluid motion, MR imaging was used to investigate fluid dynamics in syringomyelia. Three major findings characterized syringomyelia: pulsatile fluid in cysts, nonpulsatile fluid in cysts, and damaged cord tissue. The fluid in preoperative syrinx cavities pulsated in a fashion similar to subarachnoid CSF. Pulsation was more prominent in large cysts but was also seen in small cysts. Nonpulsatile cysts were generally of smaller diameter, were shorter in length, and often were single; they could, however, coexist with pulsatile cysts. Nonpulsatile cysts had etiologies similar to those of pulsatile cysts: Chiari malformation, trauma, and unknown. Damaged cord, characterized by abnormal high signal on T2-weighted sequences, was seen in 15 of 16 patients and could be either focal or diffuse but was always adjacent to syrinx cavities. Postsurgical MR scans had a lower incidence of pulsatile cysts. In five patients with both pre- and postoperative MR scans, shunting of the cyst reduced the size of the pulsating cyst (two patients) or reduced the size of the cyst and eliminated pulsation altogether (three patients). Axial, T2-weighted images are recommended in the investigation of spinal cord cysts to determine the presence or absence of pulsatile fluid. The presence of pulsation indicates a nonneoplastic cyst. The absence or reduction of CSF pulsation may prove to be a valuable indicator of the success of a shunting procedure.\r"

Initial experience has indicated that signal persisting during systole may be characteristic of slow blood flow associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or of thrombotic material secondary to pulmonary embolism. This study analyzes our cumulative experience (31 patients) with multiphasic, double spin-echo MR for assessing PAH and/or suspected pulmonary embolism. In PAH, the abnormal systolic signal showed an intensity increase from first to second echo. This pattern was observed in 92% of PAH patients, including 100% of patients with pulmonary systolic pressures greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg and 60% of patients with pressures less than 80 mm Hg. At any focus in the pulmonary arteries, such signal disappeared at some phase of the cardiac cycle. In patients with pulmonary embolism, signal from thrombus was fixed throughout the cardiac cycle and showed little or no increase in relative intensity change from first- to second-echo image. Using this guideline, MR made six confirmed positive and four confirmed negative diagnoses of proximal pulmonary embolism, while it failed to identify thrombus in the one patient with a peripheral pulmonary embolism. Intraluminal signal in the pulmonary arteries caused by PAH or pulmonary embolism can be differentiated in most instances using multiphasic, double spin-echo, ECG-gated MR. However, at its current stage of development, the procedure does not appear to be useful for the evaluation of peripheral pulmonary embolism.\r"

Two radiologists who did not know the clinical and radiologic diagnoses were asked to evaluate the scans with respect to cord expansion, distinctness of the disease margin, homogeneity, and signal intensity. These observations were correlated with the proved diagnoses. The combination of distinct margins and uniform signal intensity equal to that of CSF correlated consistently (88%) with spinal cord cysts. Other combinations were less reliable for diagnosing a cyst or tumor.\r"

The MR scans of 95 patients receiving conventional external beam radiation for a wide variety of central nervous system tumors were reviewed. Moderately T2-weighted spin-echo images with a 2000-msec repetition time and 56-msec-echo time were analyzed for white-matter abnormalities without knowledge of the patient's history. These were correlated with radiation dose, port, and time interval since completion of therapy, and then compared with an age-matched control group of 180 patients with nonirradiated, space-occupying, intracranial lesions. Radiation-related lesions were characterized as symmetric, high-signal foci in the periventricular white matter. Relative sparing of the posterior fossa, basal ganglia, and internal capsules was noted. In patients older than 20 years, these changes paralleled those seen in ischemia but were more prevalent (p less than .005). In 25 patients with sequential MR scans, these findings remained stable. In those patients with limited treatment fields, for example, pituitary adenomas, no statistical differences were seen between radiation-treated and nontreated groups. Cerebral white-matter changes that mimic deep white-matter infarction are frequently seen in response to therapeutic radiation. There is a variable incidence of radiation effects, becoming more marked in older patients. MR interpretation must consider the neuropathologic consequences of therapeutic radiation, which include demyelination, microvascular occlusion, and blood-brain barrier breakdown.\r"

The Ara-C was administered in combination with amsacrine with or without VP16-213 and prednisone. After complete remission was achieved, 27 patients received 38 consolidation courses consisting of high-dose Ara-C either alone or in combination with amsacrine with or without VP16-213 and prednisone. Seven (11%) of 66 induction courses and eight (21%) of 38 consolidation courses were complicated by respiratory failure that was considered a pulmonary reaction to Ara-C therapy. The initial findings on chest radiographs in the 15 cases included a diffuse interstitial pattern (two), a mixed interstitial-alveolar pattern (eight), an alveolar pattern (three), and a normal pattern (two). In 11 cases, the abnormalities were diffuse throughout both lungs with a preference for the lower lobes in five. The changes were localized in two cases. A small pleural effusion was observed in two patients. In the majority of cases, the initial radiographic changes progressed to a predominantly alveolar pattern. Thirteen patients recovered clinically within 2-9 days, and two patients died of pulmonary complications. Radiologic recovery took 7-21 days. Rapid regression of alveolar consolidations within 3-7 days was the first sign of radiologic improvement. The interstitial pattern gradually regressed. We conclude that the spectrum of radiologic abnormalities in cases of pulmonary reaction to Ara-C therapy includes diffuse interstitial, mixed interstitial-alveolar, or alveolar pulmonary changes.\r"

Five patients (10%) showed soft-tissue densities in the paracardiac region. The largest of these measured 3.5 mm. No more than two rounded soft-tissue densities were seen in any of the normal CT studies. Forty-five patients with paracardiac adenopathy were subsequently evaluated. In 27 (60%) of these the masses were due to either carcinoma, sarcoma, or benign disease. In 40%, the cause of paracardiac adenopathy was lymphoma. Features that favor a diagnosis of lymphoma are bilateral disease, multiple nodes, nodes greater than 2 cm in diameter, a lobulated or \"matted\" appearance, and associated pericardial thickening/effusion. Chest radiographs obtained within 2 weeks of the CT scans in 38 patients revealed only nine cases in which a paracardiac mass could be seen. This study suggests that 1 cm is the upper limit for the diameter of lymph nodes in the paracardiac region, and that paracardiac adenopathy may be caused by a wide variety of nonlymphomatous malignant and benign diseases in addition to lymphoma. Compared with CT, chest radiographs are insensitive for detecting paracardiac lymph node enlargement.\r"

The image characteristics were then correlated with the surgical type of mammoplasty performed, that is, dermal transposition of the nipple vs full-thickness nipple-areolar graft. All patients who had dermal transposition had complete or partial preservation of continuity between the subareolar ducts and the nipple. Patients who had nipple-areolar grafts showed either disruption of the subareolar ducts or very fatty breasts without visible ductal tissue.

Needles were inserted parallel to the chest wall while the breast was compressed in the mammographic unit. In each case, the tissue containing the lesion was pierced by a needle chosen to be longer than the distance from the skin to the abnormality. Simple geometric ratios were used to determine the position of the lesion along the needle shaft after slightly changing the mammographic projection and viewing the needle obliquely. In all cases, this parallax approach permitted accurate localization of the lesion.\r"

Over a 5-year period, 170 patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis participated in a cancer surveillance program at our institution. On entry, all patients underwent radiography with a double-contrast barium enema and colonoscopy with multiple random biopsies. All radiographs were reviewed retrospectively and were correlated with the colonoscopic and histologic findings. Dysplasia, ranging from mild to severe, was found in the biopsy specimens from 26 (15%) of these patients (in 59 different regions). Thirteen of the 26 patients with dysplasia had colectomies, and the specimens were available for review. Most dysplasia is not radiographically visible, as was the case in 40 (68%) of the 59 regions found histologically to have dysplasia. In the 19 regions in which dysplasia was visible radiographically, it appeared as a solitary nodule or as several separate nodules in 11 (19%) of the 59 regions or as a close grouping of multiple adjacent nodules with apposed, flattened edges in 8 (14%) of the 59 regions. The radiographic finding of a nodule or of several separate nodules was not specific because these nodules were indistinguishable from the inflammatory nodules often present in colitic colons. On the other hand, the radiographic finding of a close grouping of adjacent nodules with apposed, flattened edges was associated with dysplasia 50% of the time. This radiographic appearance was seen in five of our 26 patients who had dysplasia. Our study shows that barium examinations are useful in some patients with chronic ulcerative colitis by suggesting the presence of dysplasia and directing the endoscopist to specific locations for biopsy.\r"

Surgery was performed in two patients in whom percutaneous drainage failed. One was a diabetic patient who had a gas-forming abscess that extended into the posterior pararenal space. Surgery was necessary in a second patient because of a technical failure of catheter insertion, which resulted in perforation of the abscess cavity and peritonitis. Abscess sinograms in eight (44%) of 18 patients showed fistulas between the abscess cavity and the base of the cecum or appendix. However, the fistulas did not pose a problem in clinical management, and all closed within 14 days.

Sixty-two percent of respondents do not have cardiac monitoring apparatus readily available in the fluoroscopy suite. When readily available, such equipment is rarely (42%) or never (58%) used during routine barium examinations. Twenty-four percent of respondents take special precautions when performing examinations on these patients by reducing patient movement, the length of the examination, and the number of radiographs exposed, and by employing cardiac monitoring. Seventy-two (89%) of 81 respondents noted at least one adverse cardiovascular reaction. This was most often chest pain, but there were 10 deaths from cardiac causes. Two-thirds of respondents delay elective barium examinations of any kind for at least 4 weeks after acute myocardial infarction. The remaining one-third perform these studies earlier than 4 weeks. The latter typically limit their studies to the upper gastrointestinal tract (82%), 42% of which are single-contrast; the rest are equally divided between double-contrast and biphasic studies. This minority of radiologists is twice as likely to perform a single-contrast barium enema than a double-contrast barium enema during this period. No such preference for single-contrast (47%) over double-contrast (53%) barium enema is revealed by the majority who delay their elective barium enemas 4 or more weeks. The data indicate a strong preference to defer elective barium examinations a minimum of 4 weeks after acute myocardial infarction. A sizable minority (one-third) of radiologists, however, feel comfortable performing a single-contrast upper gastrointestinal examination at an earlier time.\r"

Hemangiomas exceeding 8 cm in diameter (mean, 13.7 cm) were studied in eight women 28-71 years old, six of whom presented with right upper quadrant discomfort and/or hepatomegaly. On unenhanced CT, seven of the masses were less dense than surrounding normal liver and one was slightly more dense than adjacent fatty liver. All masses contained additional stellate or cleftlike low-density zones, and two contained calcification. After bolus IV contrast administration, all exhibited early peripheral enhancement and partial centripetal isodense fill-in. None became completely isodense on delayed scans. Familiarity with these CT characteristics and a high index of suspicion should facilitate correct diagnosis and avert needle biopsy.\r"

Transverse images encompassing the heart and thoracic aorta were available in all patients; sagittal or coronal studies were available in 12 patients. Visualization of the aortic arch, its orientation, and the origin and course of the arch vessels was assessed. Associated intracardiac abnormalities were noted, and the effect of aberrant vessels on the trachea or esophagus was determined. Thirteen patients had a right aortic arch. Mirror-image branching was found in 10 cases, and an aberrant left subclavian artery was found in three of these. Three patients had a left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery, and two patients had a double arch. Tracheal compression caused by vascular rings was found in two patients with respiratory symptoms. Corroborating studies (angiography, surgery, CT, and autopsy) in 16 patients confirmed the MR diagnoses in all but one. We conclude that MR could substitute for other techniques as an effective, noninvasive method for the evaluation of congenital aortic arch anomalies.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to identify an ideal contrast agent for MR arthrography, signal behavior as well as T1 and T2 values for articular cartilage, menisci, and ligaments were determined in knees from cadavers and normal volunteers. Comparison was made with similar data derived for intraarticular blood, varying concentrations of an albumin-saline solution (simulating synovial fluid) and Gd-DTPA, 0.9% saline, Renografin 60%, and air. Cadaveric specimens were imaged after intraarticular administration of each substance. A 500-microM volume of Gd-DTPA proved to be an ideal contrast agent for MR arthrography, exhibiting excellent contrast differences with articular structures on T1-weighted images. An albumin concentration of 12%, potentially occurring in severe inflammatory arthritis, also manifested adequate contrast to articular cartilage on T1-weighted images. Renografin and saline provided inadequate contrast on T1-weighted images, and saline necessitated the use of T2-weighted sequences. Air was not found to be an optimal contrast agent. Intraarticular blood exhibited insufficient contrast differences with articular cartilage during the acute hemorrhagic phase. Synovial fluid associated with severe arthritis as compared with fresh intraarticular hemorrhage may thus prove to be a better biological contrast agent for MR arthrography. Saline is currently recommended for use in arthrography, but Gd-DTPA offers significant advantages and should be safety-tested for potential clinical use.\r"

PET was performed after intravenous injection of 11C-palmitate in 10 patients with ischemic and in 10 with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Regions of homogeneously severely depressed accumulation of 11C-palmitate, representing 15% or more of the expected myocardial cross-sectional area, were observed in 8 of 10 patients with ischemic but in none of 10 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy had marked spatial heterogeneity of the accumulation of palmitate throughout the left ventricular myocardium, whereas most tomographic sections from patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy accumulated 11C-palmitate more homogeneously in regions exclusive of discrete defects indicative of remote infarction. Thus, a larger number of discrete noncontiguous regions (17 +/- 5 compared with 12 +/- 4, p less than 0.001) and greater reduction of average 11C-palmitate content (59 +/- 6 compared with 64 +/- 10% maximal myocardial radioactivity, p less than 0.05) were seen in the tomographic reconstructions from patients with nonischemic than in those from patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. These findings support the hypothesis that multiple myocardial infarctions underlie the process seen as dilated cardiomyopathy in patients with coronary artery disease. Our findings indicate that PET permits differentiation of patients with ischemic from those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.\r"

There is a distinct \"cline\" in the frequencies of both polymorphisms, from white Americans to Malays. The rarer type 2 alleles of both polymorphisms, in which middle recognition sites are present--and which in our sample reach their highest frequencies in white Americans--are marginally higher in four groups of Europeans previously reported by others. The frequencies of the rarer alleles are significantly higher in Europeans than in black Americans and East Indians, and these alleles are essentially absent in Chinese and Malays. The frequency of heterozygosity diminishes in the same order, being zero in Malays for both polymorphisms. The polymorphisms are in strong linkage disequilibrium, and in all groups the type 1 allele for TaqI is disproportionately accompanied by the type 1 allele for XmnI. The paucity of type 2 alleles and the low rate of heterozygosity in four non-European groups suggest that the polymorphisms will be of little diagnostic value south of Gibraltar and east of Suez. This prediction is confirmed by the observed haplotype frequencies in the black American and the Oriental groups.\r"

The diagnosis was completed in all cases. Eleven fetuses were predicted to be affected, of which six were terminated. Forty-one of the 55 cases were confirmed. One false-negative was reported in a case predicted to be hemoglobin AS but that was determined to be hemoglobin SS at birth. We estimate that the 55 cases represent only 5% of the pregnancies at risk for a sickle hemoglobinopathy in the New York metropolitan area during the study period. We conclude that the prenatal diagnosis of sickle hemoglobinopathies by molecular methods is reliable. However, the efficiency of utilization and effectiveness of prenatal testing is dependent on the early prospective identification of couples at risk and on the education of communities concerning the significant morbidity of the sickle hemoglobinopathies and the reproductive choices now available to them.\r"

Recovery was assessed by the time to opening eyes, to be able to answer five questions correctly, to recovery of ocular balance (Maddox Wing test) and by comparing pre- and postoperative performance in a paper and pencil test (the p-deletion test). After 3 hours all the patients were fit for discharge. Recovery tests showed no differences between the groups. All patients were satisfied with the anaesthesia. Full recovery took on average 1.5 days (range between 1 hour and 14 days) in both groups. Patients' opinion 1 month after the procedure should be included in every study concerning recovery. Anaesthesia by continuous propofol infusion results in quick recovery comparable with that following isoflurane anaesthesia.\r"

The safety of long-acting nifedipine tablets was studied in 8 SLE hypertensive subjects for six months. Nifedipine reduced blood pressure from a mean 151.9 +/- 10/103.7 +/- 8.6 mmHg to a mean of 130 +/- 14.1/87.5 +/- 5 mmHg. There was no deterioration of renal function or of hematologic or immunologic indices during that period. We believe nifedipine is a safe and effective hypotensive drug in SLE, either alone or combined with beta blockers and diuretics.\r"

The study population included a group of grinders, polishers, and buffers who were heavily exposed to dust (principally free silica) and a less exposed group of cutters and carvers. Among all 218 male workers who answered the respiratory questionnaire, heavily exposed workers reported significantly higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms suggestive of mucus hypersecretion. Radiological pneumoconiosis defined as opacities with profusion of 1/0 and above was found in 27% of 157 workers who accepted radiographic and lung function examination. Radiological opacities were significantly related to increasing years of employment in both groups of workers after taking into account age and smoking habits. Decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) was significantly related to increasing years of employment in both groups after allowing for the effects of age, height, and smoking. A modest decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was related to dust exposure which was of borderline statistical significance in polishers and buffers who smoked. Radiological pneumoconiosis did not have an independent effect on lung function when allowance was made for dust exposure.\r"

An abrupt decrease in the number of T-helper (T4) cells was seen in 9 patients 12 to 24 months before the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was diagnosed (p = 0.0007 compared with those who did not develop AIDS). Thrombocytopenia also was associated with an increased risk for AIDS (p = 0.02), as was older age at the time of seroconversion (p = 0.03). Ten patients developed AIDS at 24 to 95 months after seroconversion, for a cumulative incidence (+/- SE) of 18.0% +/- 7.1% at 6 years. Hemophiliacs who had T4 cell counts of less than 200 cells/microL had a 50% +/- 16% cumulative incidence of AIDS within 2 years, indicating that decreasing or very low T4 cell counts have predictive value for the development of AIDS. Furthermore, the data suggest that thrombocytopenia and older age may be markers for a cofactor that increases the risk for AIDS in hemophiliacs.\r"

In a study of 390 patients consecutively referred for nuclear exercise testing, abnormal results found in 31% of the women and in 64% of the men affected physicians' decisions to recommend catheterization in men only; 4% of the women with abnormal radionuclide scans were referred for catheterization compared with 40% of the men (p less than 0.001). this 10:1 ratio was independent of age. A multiple logistic regression analysis that controlled for age, previous myocardial infarction, presence of typical and atypical angina, and abnormal test results yielded an odds ratio of 6.3 for men. The male-to-female ratio of patients with coronary artery disease given abnormal results of a cardiovascular nuclear scan is only 2:1. Thus, the sex differential in decisions to refer patients for cardiac catheterization cannot be explained entirely by differences in the sensitivity of tests or the rates of coronary artery disease; it also cannot be explained by differential benefits from surgery. These findings raise the question of whether coronary artery bypass surgery is underused in women.\r"

Diffuse alveolar damage was typically a feature of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, but neither lung biopsy nor bronchoalveolar lavage detected a pathogen. Of these 41 patients, 13 had no associated pulmonary tumor and had not been exposed to pulmonary toxins, whereas 28 patients had either concurrent pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma, previous experimental therapies, or a history of pneumocystis pneumonia or drug abuse. Of these 41, 23 had normal chest radiographs. The clinical features of patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis were similar to those of patients with pneumocystis pneumonia, although histologic findings showed less severe alveolar damage in patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (p less than 0.001). Pathologic evaluation and clinical follow-up suggest that many clinical episodes of pneumonitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are due to nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis of unknown cause.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the hemodynamic improvement in cardiac valve prostheses, valve-related deaths and complications have remained a substantial source of morbidity and mortality. This follow-up study was carried out in April, 1986, in a group of 816 patients who received 876 St. Jude Medical prostheses between October, 1977, and October, 1984. One hundred fifty-five patients (37%) of the 422 having aortic valve replacement (AVR) and 88 (29%) of the 300 having mitral valve replacement (MVR) had concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting, and 94 patients (12%) had miscellaneous procedures performed in addition to valve replacement. Sixty-three patients died within the operative period, an operative mortality of 7.7%. Follow-up was complete for 98% of the patients; the mean follow-up was 42 months. At that time, 87 more patients had died, a late mortality of 11.9%. There were 13 valve-related deaths (4 in the AVR group, 7 in the MVR group, and 2 in the miscellaneous group); the causes of death were thromboembolism (7), anticoagulant-related hemorrhage (2), valve thrombosis (2), prosthetic valve endocarditis (1), and perivalvular leak (1). There were 37 thromboembolic episodes (1.78/100 patient-years) and 67 anticoagulant-related hemorrhages (3.22/100 patient-years), 46% of which necessitated transfusion. The incidence of valve thrombosis was 0.6% (4 patients). Perivalvular leak and prosthetic valve endocarditis occurred in 7 patients (1.0%) and 5 patients (0.7%), respectively. Reoperation was carried out in 6 patients (0.8%), but only for perivalvular leak. There were no deaths, no complications, and no clinical evidence of malfunction of the prosthetic valve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Two categories--patients alive and free from new myocardial infarction (MI) and time to first new MI (nonfatal and fatal)--were compared in medical and early surgical groups in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) registry with Class I or II angina and three-vessel disease in a six-year follow-up. There were 413 in the medical group and 443 in the early surgical group. A broad definition of MI using ECG and clinical criteria on hospital discharge and follow-up was used to include as many new MIs as possible, including perioperative MIs. Stratification was by left ventricular wall motion score and number of proximal segment stenoses and by quintile of propensity score to reduce selection bias in therapy groups. Adjusted by propensity analysis, 79% of medical and 88% of surgical patients (p = .005) were free from new MI; death without diagnosis of new MI was censored. Similarly adjusted, 57% of medical and 76% of surgical patients (p less than .0001) were alive and free from new MI at six years. For patients with previous MI, surgery offered the probability of protection from new MI: with multiple prior MIs, 66% of medical and 88% of surgical patients were free from new MI at six years (p = .0019). This is a nonrandomized, observational study with the limitations of such studies: the need to adjust for differences in baseline traits in medical and surgical groups and the unknown effects of unobserved variables. Fifty-one variables, including therapy, were tested by Cox model with time to new MI as the end point. Early surgery was the strongest independent predictor of freedom from new MI (p = .002) with a relative risk of 51% compared with medical therapy (95% confidence limits of 33 to 78%). In patients with multiple prior MIs, the new MI risk with early surgery was 24% of that for medicine, with an upper 95% confidence point of 64%.\r"

Platelet aggregation to heparin in vitro is used to confirm the diagnosis. Cessation of heparin therapy with avoidance of reexposure to heparin is an important principle in the management of HATT. However, certain patients with HATT may require reexposure to heparin for emergency cardiac operations requiring cardiopulmonary bypass while still demonstrating positive in vitro platelet aggregation with heparin. The present report describes the management of 2 such patients. In each patient aspirin was shown to inhibit platelet aggregation to heparin in vitro; therefore, aspirin and dipyridamole were administered to each patient before heparin reexposure and continued throughout the perioperative period. Cardiopulmonary bypass with full heparinization was achieved without thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications in both patients. Despite the presence of a heparin-dependent platelet-aggregating factor in the plasma of these 2 patients, inhibition of platelet aggregation with aspirin and dipyridamole allowed uneventful reexposure to heparin.\r"

The rate of UGI tract bleeding in the 30 days following each drug exposure was examined in the 88,044 patients dispensed only one of seven NSAIDs. The rate of UGI tract bleeding differed significantly among users of these drugs. Stratification and logistic regression were used to adjust for multiple potential confounding factors, without substantive changes in the results. An alcohol-drug interaction was found. Sulindac users had the highest rate of UGI tract bleeding, and it was the only drug statistically different from ibuprofen. When the average daily dose of sulindac received was divided by the maximum recommended daily dose, it was notably higher than those for other drugs. Repeated analyses using data from 1982 confirmed these results. We conclude that there are significant and consistent differences in the incidence of UGI tract bleeding associated with the use of NSAIDs in this population.\r"

These patients were classified into three groups according to their clinical improvement three months later, and results of single photon emission computed tomography were compared with computed tomographic scan results and correlated to the clinical outcome. Regional brain hypoactivity of IMP differed in some cases between early and delayed IMP scans, showing in those cases a \"redistribution\" activity. The amplitude of this redistribution was significantly correlated with the clinical outcome of patients with stroke, whereas the value of hypoactivity on early IMP scan did not show such a correlation. The higher the redistribution amplitude was, the better was the clinical outcome. Comparative regional brain hypoactivity of IMP on early and delayed scans could represent a prognostic index of clinical recovery inasmuch as it gives information concerning viability of ischemic brain tissue.\r"

  ".U": "87242162\r", 
  ".W": "Magnetic resonance velocity mapping is a new technique which provides a display of velocity within the cardiovascular system at any point of the cardiac cycle. A short field echo sequence with even echo rephasing is used to obtain a signal from rapidly moving blood and a cine display is provided by rapid repetition of the sequence. The amplitude image shows the anatomy, with blood giving a high signal and areas of turbulent flow no signal. The phase image is a map of velocities at each point in the image plane. Thirteen cases are described in which the technique either provided a diagnosis or helped in functional assessment. Flow through atrial and ventricular septal defects was seen, although turbulent flow distal to the ventricular shunts led to some loss of quantitative information. In three patients with valve disease jets of abnormal flow were seen because of signal loss and it is suggested that the size of the area of turbulence may be used to quantify the severity of regurgitation. Velocities were measured in four coronary artery bypass grafts in two patients, and low velocity was seen in a graft with distal disease that supplied the infarcted territory. Velocity was reduced distal to an aortic coarctation and it was increased at the site of narrowing caused by thrombosis in a deep vein. The speed and direction of flow in the central vessels in a patient with complex congenital heart disease helped to establish the anatomy. The technique provides useful information in a wide range of disorders of the cardiovascular system, and in some cases may avoid the need for invasive investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty nine of 327 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angioplasty at a centre had unstable angina--defined as either a worsening of the frequency or the severity of chest pain or severe episodes of chest pain at rest with no evidence of acute myocardial infarction. Multivessel disease was present in 31 of these patients. Two or more vessels were dilated in the same procedure in one fifth of the patients. Primary success was obtained in 80 (90%) patients. Acute myocardial infarction was a complication in four (5%) patients, including two of four patients who needed emergency coronary bypass grafting. Follow up coronary angiography at a mean (SD) of 10 (6) months in 57 patients showed restenosis in 21 (37%): of these, 13 patients had repeat coronary angioplasty and three had elective coronary bypass grafting. All patients in whom angioplasty was initially successful were followed up for 10 (6) months after the last angioplasty procedure. There were no deaths. One patient had sustained a myocardial infarction unrelated to the dilated vessel. Clinically, 74 patients improved by at least one New York Heart Association class and 40 (50%) were symptom free and with no signs or symptoms of myocardial ischaemia on a stress test. Coronary angioplasty offers long term symptomatic improvement at an acceptable risk in the majority of patients with unstable angina.\r"

In 89 patients the intervention was a repeat bypass operation, in 24 it was angioplasty, and 10 had both. Procedure related mortality was significantly higher at reintervention (5.6%) than at the primary operation (1.2%). Survival probability after a single bypass procedure was 90% at six years and 82(3)% at nine years. Corresponding figures six and nine years after reintervention were 89(6)% and 87(7)% respectively. Stepwise multivariate analysis showed that survival was significantly correlated with left ventricular function (rate ratio 1.82) and with extent of vascular disease (rate ratio 1.80) but not with reintervention (rate ratio 1.45). Symptomatic improvement occurred in 89% of the survivors with or without reintervention. Repeat procedures are often necessary after coronary artery bypass grafting but they appear to provide appreciable relief of symptoms without reducing any long term improvement in survival brought about by the original operation.\r"

Hairless rats were given varying doses of etretin intraperitoneally for 21 days, or a fixed dose for 2, 8 and 16 days. Abdominal skin was taken and processed for light microscopy, autoradiography (using [3H]-thymidine) and ILI assays. ILI was assayed in supernatants of epidermal extracts by both the lymphocyte activating factor (LAF) assay and the stimulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release from dermal fibroblasts. A significant increase in both LAF and PGE2 stimulatory activities was found during etretin administration. After 21 days' treatment with varying doses there was a two- to three-fold increase as compared to the controls, with a peak at 2 and 5 mg/kg. At a fixed dose a two-fold increase was found after 2 days and a three- to four-fold increase after 16 days; normal pretreatment values were restored 16 days after cessation of etretin. This is the first demonstration in vivo that a retinoid can modulate ILI content in a tissue. As epidermal ILI has been found to be decreased in psoriasis, its modulation by retinoids might have therapeutic significance.\r"

  ".W": "Sialophorin, previously called gpL115, is the heavily sialylated surface protein that is defective in lymphocytes of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Using the monoclonal antibody L10 as a probe, sialophorin expression was detected on isolated T lymphocytes and thymocytes, B cell lines, monocytes, neutrophils, and platelets, but not on erythrocytes, fibroblasts, and glioblastoma cells. This unusual distribution pattern suggests that sialophorin is expressed on all circulating cells except erythrocytes. Trace amounts of the sialophorin molecules on lymphocytes are incompletely sialylated, but significant amounts of the molecules on thymocytes are incompletely sialylated. The molecular form of sialophorin on T lymphocytes, thymocytes, and monocytes is the previously characterized species of apparent mol wt 115,000. A newly described sialophorin species of apparent mol wt 135,000 was found on neutrophils and platelets. The 115,000 lymphocyte/monocyte form and the 135,000 platelet/neutrophil form were shown to be substantially similar. The two forms have approximately the same content of sialylated O-linked carbohydrate units since both undergo the same atypical shift in electrophoretic mobility on desialylation. Both contain the epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody L2 and the epitope recognized by L10 antibody. Moreover, evidence from another study indicates that the polypeptide portions are identical, cumulatively suggesting that 115,000 sialophorin and 135,000 sialophorin are identical except for the presence on the latter of additional neutral saccharide residues.\r"

L-BCGF induced a significant increase in 3H-TdR incorporation in 28 of 37 bone marrow aspirates from patients with B cell precursor ALL, with stimulation indices ranging from 2 to 129. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting confirmed that in five of seven patients the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA)/CD10 positive leukemic cells were responding directly to L-BCGF. L-BCGF was capable of inducing, in some patients, an increase in absolute viable cells and could also induce colony formation in vitro. The response of B cell precursor ALL was not attributable to beta IL 1, IL 2, or gamma interferon. These results indicate that the majority of B cell precursor ALL undergo a proliferative response to L-BCGF, suggesting a regulatory role for this lymphokine in the growth of B cell precursors.\r"

  ".W": "The infusion of 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) in normal individuals is followed by an increase in factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (vWF) in plasma, by an increase in intensity of all sizes of multimers, and by the appearance of larger multimers of vWF than those seen in the resting state. Since the larger multimers are rapidly cleared and proteolysis is known to cause disaggregation of large multimers, we evaluated the degree of vWF proteolysis after DDAVP administration. DDAVP was infused into eight normal adult volunteers, and the relative proportions of the intact 225 kilodalton (kDa) subunit and the 189, 176, and 140 kDa vWF fragments were compared before and at different times after DDAVP infusion. The relative proportion of the 176 kDa fragment was increased, whereas that of the other species was decreased, thereby indicating that proteolytic fragmentation had occurred. However, plasmin did not appear to be responsible because the vWF fragments characteristically produced by this enzyme could not be detected. Concomitant analysis of vWF multimeric structure showed that these changes were accompanied by an increase in the relative proportion of the satellite bands, which suggests that they were proteolytically generated. Proteolysis may explain, at least in part, rapid clearance of larger vWF multimers released by DDAVP.\r"

  ".W": "Eight permanent cell lines were established from cells of 50 consecutive patients with childhood acute leukemia. Three cell lines required growth factor-containing conditioned media. Analysis using blocking antisera and recombinant granulocytic macrophage (GM) colony-stimulating factor (CSF) identified GM-CSF as a growth factor required to establish the latter three cell lines and necessary for their continuous proliferation in chemically defined medium. Two of the GM-CSF-dependent cell lines were derived from patients with undifferentiated T- and a biphenotypic B-myelomonocytic leukemia, which suggests that GM-CSF might maintain proliferation of leukemias originating from immature progenitor cells. Cytogenetic analysis indicated that all established leukemic cell lines were aneuploid, with six lines containing chromosomal alterations related to those observed in the leukemic cells of the patient. Two patients did not have an abnormal clone identified in the marrow but did yield an aneuploid cell line. These studies indicate that GM-CSF-dependent leukemic cell lines can be established in a fraction of childhood leukemia. These cell lines lend themselves to studies aimed at the evaluation in vitro of the role of growth factors in controlling proliferation and differentiation of leukemic cells.\r"

The monkeys responded to the rh GM-CSF with a prompt (within 24 hours) rise in circulating white blood cells (WBCs). Thereafter the total cell counts increased steadily in a dose-dependent manner with repeated dosing to numbers six times over the pretreatment levels. Overall, granulocyte counts increased fivefold, lymphocytes twofold to fourfold, and monocytes threefold to fourfold. Platelets and erythrocytes were unaffected. Within 1 week after the end of treatment the leukocytosis had disappeared. Of the two routes of treatment, SC (three times daily)-administered rh GM-CSF was more effective than the same dose given by a six-hour IV infusion. In addition to inducing leukocytosis, parenterally administered rh GM-CSF primed mature circulating granulocytes for enhanced oxidative metabolism and killing of an E coli strain. These results show that exogenously administered glycosylated or nonglycosylated rh GM-CSF is both an effective stimulator of leukocytosis and a potent activator of the phagocytic function of mature granulocytes in monkeys.\r"

  ".W": "B cell stimulatory factor-1 (BSF-1)/Interleukin 4 (IL 4) is a T cell product originally characterized on the basis of its actions on B lymphocytes. Recently it has been reported that BSF-1 activates T cell and mast cell lines. We now provide evidence that BSF-1, purified to homogeneity, also has a broad spectrum of activity on hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). However, like its action on B cells, prolierative effects were only observed when BSF-1 was combined with an additional factor. Thus BSF-1, in costimulation with recombinant G-CSF, enhances the proliferation of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM). BSF-1 increases the proliferation of CFU-e in the presence of recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO). Furthermore, BSF-1 induces, together with rEPO, colony formation by primitive erythroid (BFU-e) and multipotent (CFU-mix) progenitor cells comparable to that observed with rEPO and interleukin 3 (IL 3). BSF-1 is also active as a megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor; in combination with recombinant interleukin 1, rEPO or the supernatant of the T cell hybridoma FS7-20.6.18, BSF-1 induces megakaryocyte colony formation (CFU-Mk). The same factors that synergize with BSF-1 also enhance CFU-Mk proliferation induced by IL 3. Although the precise mechanisms of action of BSF-1 on HPC is not yet known, we propose that BSF-1 represents an activation factor for HPC and prepares the progenitor cells to respond to specific growth or differentiation factors.\r"

During and after the administration of dCF, high amounts of dATP were found in the lymphoid cells and the erythrocytes (maximally, 480 pmol/10(6) lymphocytes and 5.5 nmol/10(6) erythrocytes), but not in the polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The amount of dATP in the erythrocytes, however, was significantly lower than described in the literature. During each administration of dCF, the number of blast cells in the peripheral blood rose initially, followed by a rapid decrease. After three courses, a hematologic remission was achieved and maintained for 6 weeks; then an autologous bone-marrow transplantation was performed. During the first dCF course a large amount of deoxyadenosine was found in the urine. During the second course, this excretion was much lower, but still higher than in healthy individuals.

Endothelium-denuded aortic rings of rats were used for the bioassay and tension recording. After precontraction, this preparation showed no response to histamine, acetylcholine, A 23187, or adenosine triphosphate while serotonin elicited further contraction. Superfusion of the precontracted preparations with the perfusate from umbilical veins and arteries stimulated with histamine (10(-7)-10(-5) M), A23187 (10(-7)-10(-6) M), or adenosine triphosphate (10(-5)-10(-4) M) elicited a relaxation. No relaxation was obtained with acetylcholine (10(-8)-10(-6) M) or serotonin (10(-8)-10(-6) M). The relaxation of bioassay aortic rings under the influence of the perfusate from histamine-stimulated umbilical vessels was inhibited by mepyramine (10(-5) M) but not by cimetidine (10(-4) M) suggesting the involvement of H1-receptors. The relaxation was also inhibited by increasing the transit time between the donor and the detector preparation, by methylene blue (5 X 10(-5) M), and by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (5 X 10(-5) M) but not by indomethacin (5 X 10(-5) M), and which have been reported for endothelium-derived relaxing factor. The involvement of umbilical endothelial cells in the relaxation response was further confirmed by studying precontracted, rubbed rat aortic rings seeded with cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical veins. Such preparations relaxed in response to histamine (10(-7)-10(-4) M) in contrast with the control preparations.

Immediately after the first tomographic scan, thallium-201 was injected into nine of 12 dogs and imaging was repeated. Estimated infarct size in grams was calculated from transaxially reconstructed, normalized, and background-corrected indium SPECT images with the use of a threshold technique for edge detection. Estimated noninfarcted myocardium in grams was calculated from obliquely reconstructed thallium SPECT images by a similar method. The animals were killed and infarct size in grams and true infarct size as a percentage of total left ventricular myocardial volume were measured by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Estimated infarct size from indium SPECT images showed an excellent correlation with true infarct size (r = .95, SEE = 4.1 g). Estimated percentage myocardium infarcted was calculated by dividing estimated infarct size from indium images by the sum of estimated infarct size plus estimated noninfarcted myocardium obtained from thallium images. Correlation between the estimated percentage of myocardium infarcted and true percentage of myocardium infarcted was excellent (r = .93, SEE = 4.4%). We conclude that dual-isotope SPECT with indium 111-monoclonal antimyosin antibodies and thallium-201 can accurately estimate infarct size and percentage myocardium infarcted.\r"

A 1-week placebo (baseline) period preceded 2 weeks of fenoprofen therapy (enteric coated or plain, 600 mg q.i.d.). Fecal blood loss was measured by 51Cr-tagged erythrocyte assay and averaged over days 4 to 7 (baseline) and 11 to 14 and 18 to 21 (active therapy). At one center gastrointestinal irritation was evaluated endoscopically before and after active therapy. Endoscopy showed both formulations to cause mucosal damage not evident by subject-reported symptoms. Four of the 16 subjects developed asymptomatic duodenal ulcers. Mean daily fecal blood loss was significantly lower (P = 0.03) with enteric-coated (mean +/- SD, 1.104 +/- 0.961 ml/day) than with plain fenoprofen calcium (mean +/- SD, 1.686 +/- 0.858 ml/day), suggesting that tolerance of fenoprofen can be improved with administration in an enteric-coated form.\r"

Right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) was measured by multigated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography with krypton-81m. Both the thallium scores and RVEF values correlated well with pulmonary arterial pressure (r = 0.65 and r = -0.86, respectively) and permitted the structural and functional assessment of cor pulmonale. When the patients were classified according to the thallium scores and RVEF values, those who had both a high thallium score and reduced RVEF had a significantly high pulmonary arterial pressure and vice versa. The combined evaluation of the thallium score and RVEF enabled accurate noninvasive assessment of cor pulmonale.\r"

The authors tested the hypothesis that the combined effect of these factors may promote the development of metastatic tumor implants and that perioperative treatment with Human Recombinant Interleukin-2 (RIL-2), a known immunostimulant of t, natural killer (NK), and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells may reduce the incidence of liver metastases from transplantable rat colon cancers. Hepatic metastases were induced in male Fischer 344 (F344) rats by injecting 10(7) rat colon tumor cells into the portal venous system during laparotomy. Control rats developed tumors by four weeks and were dead by ten weeks. Eleven groups of rats underwent celiotomy with portal vein injection of tumor on day three. Rats received either no RIL-2, RIL-2, or excipient buffer at varying doses on days 1 through 5 or 3 through 7 of these experiments. Animals were assessed for the presence of tumor and the incidence of liver metastases at autopsy (sacrifice and autopsy performed at seven weeks). Eighty-five percent of the rats in the untreated group developed tumor. This compared with only 50 percent of animals receiving 10(3) u/dose (P less than .025) and 42 percent of animals receiving 10(4) u/dose (P less than .01) of Interleukin-2 on days 1 through 5. Animals receiving very high doses of RIL-2 (10(5) or 4 X 10(5) units per dose) had a greater chance of developing tumors than did control rats, or rats receiving lower doses of RIL-2 (P less than .05). It is concluded that the perioperative period may be critical for the implantation and growth of metastatic disease and that perioperative immunostimulation with RIL-2 can decrease the incidence of tumors in these animals. This model may have relevance to the treatment of human colon cancer.\r"

In these patients, when compared with normal and diseased controls, there was a significant reduction in the total number of circulating T cells because of a disproportionate decrease in Leu-2a (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells. This decrease resulted in a significantly increased ratio of Leu-3a to Leu-2a cells. Patients with cirrhosis had significantly higher Leu-3a/Leu-2a (helper/suppressor) ratios than did noncirrhotic patients; both disease groups, however, had ratios that were significantly higher than controls. The number and percentage of B cells were significantly increased. Alterations in the percentage of B cells correlated significantly with histologic stage and concentrations of gamma globulin, serum IgG, and bilirubin. We conclude that these abnormalities are suggestive of a defect in immunoregulation in primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is not secondary to advanced liver disease alone and appears to be independent of chronic ulcerative colitis or obstructive jaundice.\r"

  ".U": "87246359\r", 
  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine the role of the posterior pituitary in the regulation of PRL release during suckling. Lactating rats were subjected to posterior pituitary lobectomy (LOBEX) or sham surgery (SHAM) and separation from pups in the evening; experimental manipulations and blood collection were performed the next morning. In the first experiment rats were divided into three groups: SHAM, LOBEX, and LOBEX treated with a vasopressin analog, 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin and oxytocin. Plasma PRL levels in SHAM rats increased 20- to 25-fold upon introduction of pups and remained elevated for the duration of suckling. In contrast, basal plasma PRL levels in LOBEX rats were 3- to 4-fold higher than in SHAM but suckling failed to induce a further increase. Treatment of LOBEX rats with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin and oxytocin reduced water consumption and allowed for milk ejection and milk intake by the pups but did not restore the suckling-induced rise in PRL. The second experiment tested the functional integrity of the hypothalamic dopamine (DA) and serotonergic systems after LOBEX and the ability of LOBEX-lactating rats to respond to PRL-releasing stimuli other than suckling. Injections of alpha-methyl-para tyrosine, an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, and 5-hydroxytryptophan, a precursor of serotonin, caused 20- to 30-fold rises in plasma PRL levels in both LOBEX and SHAM rats. Exposure to ether elicited a 3- to 4-fold rise in PRL which was higher in magnitude and of longer duration in LOBEX than in SHAM rats. Conclusions: Removal of the posterior pituitary from lactating rats results in an increase in basal PRL levels and a complete abolishment of the suckling-induced rise. Vasopressin and oxytocin restore water balance and milk ejection in the LOBEX rat but fail to affect PRL secretion. The LOBEX-lactating rat is not refractory to PRL-releasing stimuli other than suckling and its hypothalamic DA and serotonergic systems are functionally intact. In addition to DA, the posterior pituitary appears to contain a PRL-releasing factor(s) which mediates the suckling-induced rise in PRL.\r"

To determine a potential cellular basis of this synergism, we measured androgen receptor (AR) in the cytosol of 16 hypothalamic and limbic nuclei and subregions in castrated male rats and castrated rats treated with estradiol. Androgen receptor was measured by a previously validated in vitro binding assay using the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone [( 3H]R1881). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) were castrated 2 weeks before the implantation of a 2.5-cm Silastic capsule filled with crystalline 17 beta-estradiol. Control rats were sham implanted. Estrogen treatment lasted for 1 week, after which time the animals were killed, their brains were frozen and sectioned, and individual nuclei and subregions were removed by a tissue punch technique. Tissue from six rats were combined for each determination. The highest levels of AR were found in the ventromedial nucleus (16.5 +/- 1.4 fmol/mg protein), medial preoptic area (12.1 +/- 1.4 fmol/mg protein), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (11.6 +/- 1.4 fmol/mg protein), lateral septum (11.4 +/- 1.4 fmol/mg protein), arcuate nucleus-median eminence (10.9 +/- 2.1 fmol/mg protein), and medial amygdala (10.3 +/- 0.9 fmol/mg protein). Estrogen treatment resulted in significant increases in AR in medial preoptic area (14.8 +/- 0.6 fmol/mg protein; P less than 0.05) and medial amygdala (14.6 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg protein; P less than 0.02). Subsequent studies using block-dissected hypothalamus-preoptic area, anterior pituitary, and prostate revealed significant estrogen-mediated elevations in AR in anterior pituitary cytosol [42.2 +/- 3.0 vs. 26.4 +/- 1.6 fmol/mg protein (control); P less than 0.01], but not in hypothalamus-preoptic area or prostate cytosols. Estrogen treatment had no effect on AR affinity. The binding of [3H]R1881 was specific for AR and was not affected by the addition of radioinert progesterone to the incubation tube. Estimates of AR concentration were similar regardless of whether [3H]R1881 or [3H]dihydrotestosterone was used as the ligand. In this study, we describe the distribution of AR throughout the hypothalamus and limbic areas using biochemical techniques. In addition, we have identified some cellular events that may mediate the synergistic actions of estrogen and androgen on the neuroendocrine system.\r"

A macrophages growth factor (MGF) was purified and, at the final step of purification on HPLC, eluted at the same position as a colony-stimulating factor (CSF), suggesting that MGF is identical with CSF. In the present study, we examined the relationship between proliferation and fusion of macrophages using purified CSF (MGF) and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3]. The latter was used in place of a macrophage fusion factor which is supposed to be contained in the same conditioned medium, since a macrophage fusion factor has not yet been isolated. Adding less than 5% unfractionated conditioned medium from Concanavalin A-stimulated spleen cells markedly induced proliferation of alveolar macrophages without inducing fusion. In contrast, adding the same unfractionated conditioned medium at concentrations of 10% or more suppressed proliferation dose dependently, whereas it induced fusion reciprocally. Proliferation of macrophages was similarly enhanced by adding purified CSF or retinoic acid. Fusion of macrophages was induced by 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3, but not by purified CSF or retinoic acid. Adding 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 together with purified CSF or retinoic acid completely suppressed the increase of proliferation induced by either growth factor, whereas that treatment rather potentiated the fusion induced by 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 alone. These results indicate that the fusion and proliferation of macrophages occur in a reciprocal fashion.\r"

Two experimental paradigms were used: cells were incubated with maximally effective concentrations of calcium (4.0 mM); alternatively, cells were treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX). The specificity of the DEX-mediated response was assessed by using the synthetic antiglucocorticoid, RU-486. Calcium was not mitogenic in 44-2C cells and did not affect cell growth. Calcium increased the secretion and cellular accumulation of NT. In contrast, calcium treatment decreased CT content and release while it diminished the levels of CT- and CGRP-specific messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. DEX (10(-8) M) inhibited cell proliferation. NT content and secretion increased after DEX treatment, and this was potentiated by the addition of calcium. DEX-treated cells showed diminished CT content and secretion. The levels of CT- and CGRP-specific mRNA were significantly reduced in DEX-treated cultures. RU-486 antagonized the action of DEX and blocked DEX-inhibited cell proliferation. Inhibition of CT secretion by DEX was blocked by RU-486; CT- and CGRP-specific mRNA levels were increased in response to treatment with equimolar or 100-fold excess concentrations of RU-486. We conclude that NT secretion as well as CT/CGRP expression and release can be differentially regulated in the 44-2C cell line.\r"

The majority of adenoma cells (90%) stained specifically with antiserum against human ACTH. The electrophysiological properties and response to hormones of these cells were studied with intracellular recording techniques under current clamp and voltage clamp conditions. Most (80%) of the cells fired action potentials that were Ca2+-dependent inasmuch as they were blocked by Co2+ (5 mM) and by removal of Ca2+ from the medium, but were unaffected by tetrodotoxin (0.3 mM) and by Na+ removal. The cells responded to factors known to stimulate ACTH release, including high K+, CRF, and angiotensin II (AII). High K+ (50 mM) induced a membrane depolarization in association with an increase in conductance. CRF (100 nM) produced a depolarization, a decrease in conductance, an increase in spike firing, and an increase in spike duration. Although AII was inactive in ordinary recordings, in cells loaded with lithium (Li+) to promote the phospholipid-dependent second messenger system, the peptide produced an increase in spike firing and spike duration with no change in membrane potential. The combination of CRF and AII (CRF + AII; 100 nM each) in Li+-loaded cells caused a greater excitatory effect than either peptide alone. Under voltage clamp, the response either to CRF or to CRF + AII could be attributed, at least in part, to the inhibition of a slow, voltage-dependent K+ current that is persistently active at resting potential. These results indicate that modulation of action potential firing may be an early step in the regulation of ACTH release from pituitary cells by known secretagogues. Since action potentials in these cells are associated with Ca2+ entry, the resulting changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels could mediate the effects of the hormones on secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Conversion of T4 to T3 cannot be demonstrated in vivo in Rana catesbeiana tadpoles until just before metamorphic climax, suggesting that 5'-deiodinase (5'D) activity is not present until this time. In the present study the role of 5-deiodinase (5 D) systems in the metabolism of T4 and T3 in the developing tadpole was examined. 5 D activity capable of converting T3 to 3,3'-diiodothyronine, and T4 to rT3 was present in hepatic microsomes from pre- and prometamorphic tadpoles, but it declined to undetectable levels during metamorphic climax. The preferred substrate was T3. The Vmax for T3 in premetamorphic tadpoles was 30.4 +/- (SE) 6.37 fmol/min X mg microsomal protein, and the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) was 3.6 +/- 0.72 nM, respectively. The characteristics of the system are similar to those of the type III iodothyronine deiodinase present in mammals. The system has its counterpart in vivo; administration of T3 or T4 to tadpoles resulted in the generation of detectable amounts of the corresponding 5-deiodinated product. rT3 was also shown to be a naturally occurring iodothyronine in this species. Although generation of T3 from T4 was readily demonstrable in vivo in tadpoles that had entered metamorphic climax, hepatic 5'D activity determined in vitro was found to be extremely low at all stages of development. On the basis of these findings, the following alternative explanation for the failure to observe T4 to T3 conversion before climax is offered. In pre- and prometamorphic tadpoles, any T3 produced from T4 is rapidly converted to 3,3'-diiodothyronine by the 5 D system and thus accumulation is prevented. Once climax has begun, 5 D activity declines and thus the T3 generated is able to accumulate. Whether the increased T3 accumulation is also facilitated by an increase in T3 production due to increased 5'D activity remains to be determined.\r"

Female Sprague-Dawley rats (240-280 g) that were ovariectomized for 3 days were used in this study. AR numbers were determined in pituitary cytosol and nuclear fractions by binding and exchange assays using the synthetic ligand 17 alpha-methyl-3H-trienolone. The administration of a single dose of estradiol benzoate [(EB) 10 micrograms/100 g BW] to ovariectomized female rats resulted in a 60% increase in cytosolic AR which was significantly (P less than 0.01) elevated above that of oil-treated controls by 12 h post EB. Cytosolic AR levels remained elevated for as long as 48 h post EB (213% of controls). Saturation analysis of pituitary cytosolic AR revealed a single, high affinity binding site for 17 alpha-methyl-3H-trienolone exhibiting an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.5 X 10(-10) M in both EB- and oil-treated animals. The administration of cycloheximide (1 mg/kg BW) before EB administration prevented the EB-induced rise in AR when measured 8 h post EB. When dihydrotestosterone (1.5 mg) was injected 24 h after EB or oil, there was a rapid increase in nuclear AR accompanied by a rapid decrease in cytosolic AR. The increase in nuclear AR was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in EB-pretreated animals vs. oil-treated controls. These observations show that a potential synergism exists between androgen and estrogen in the female rat pituitary and suggest that androgens may play an important role in regulating cyclic pituitary hormone release.\r"

  ".W": "The hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) in kidney mitochondria from female rats of different ages was studied. The specific activity of 1 alpha-hydroxylase was highest in mitochondria isolated from the 2-month-old rat (0.47 pmol/10 min X mg protein), falling gradually with age to 0.17, 0.10, 0.07, and 0.06 pmol/10 min X mg protein in 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old rats, respectively. The alteration in 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity with age was due to a change in the V'm of the system; the K'm for 25OHD3 was unchanged (3.9-4.0 microM). The specific activity of 24-hydroxylase was lowest in mitochondria isolated from the 2-month-old rat (8.2 pmol/10 min X mg protein), increasing to 37.8, 37.4, 38.2, and 55.7 pmol/10 min X mg protein in 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old rats, respectively. The alteration in 24-hydroxylase activity with age was due to a change in the V'm of the system; the K'm value for 25OHD3 was unchanged (1.1-1.2 microM). The age-dependent decrease in 1 alpha-hydroxylase and concomitant increase in 24-hydroxylase activities observed in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of 2-, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old rats could not be attributed to changes in the bioenergetic properties, i.e. the respiratory chain, of the mitochondria. The relative mitochondrial content of the kidney, however, probably decreased with age. These findings support the view that the kidneys of aged rats produce less 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 because of lower mitochondrial 1 alpha-hydroxylase specific activity and reduced number of mitochondria. This would be consistent with the lower levels of vitamin D hormone reported in the serum of senescent rats.\r"

  ".W": "After adrenal enucleation (AE) rats avidly retain sodium (early phase), but after 7-10 days they lose this sodium avidity (late phase). Although increased production of a mineralocorticoid, 19-nor-deoxycorticosterone (19-Nor-DOC), has been implicated, 19-Nor-DOC levels during the early and late phases of AE have not been systematically measured. Furthermore it is not known why 19-Nor-DOC production should increase during a time when production of 11 beta- and 18-hydroxylated corticosteroids are decreased in AE. The purpose of this study was to examine the 11 beta, 18-, and 19-hydroxylase pathways in the early and late phases of AE. The results demonstrate increased urinary 19-Nor-DOC and decreased 18-OH-DOC and corticosterone excretion in the early phase of AE at a time when adrenal mitochondrial 11 beta- and 18-hydroxylase activities were decreased but 19-hydroxylase activity was unchanged. During the late phase of AE, urinary 19-Nor-DOC had decreased and 18-OH-DOC and corticosterone had increased to levels indistinguishable from those in sham controls. This reduction in 19-Nor-DOC was associated with a decrease in 19-hydroxylase activity in AE. Since the 11 beta, 18-, and 19-hydroxylases have a common substrate (DOC), it is possible that differential flux of DOC through these pathways could account for the changes in steroid production in AE. These data suggest that the increased 19-Nor-DOC excretion in AE may be due to alterations in enzyme activity leading to a shunting of DOC into the 19-Nor-DOC pathway. In addition, the synchronicity of 19-Nor-DOC with sodium excretion suggests that it has an important role in the pathogenesis of the sodium retention in AE.\r"

Gastroscopic biopsy studies on 284 first degree relatives of San Marinese gastric cancer patients in the Republic of San Marino and in Detroit, where 2,000-2,500 San Marinese reside, have allowed detection of six gastric malignancies. Intestinal metaplasia of gastric mucosa was found in 16 (52%) of 31 Detroit first degree relatives and 51 (36%) of 143 San Marino first degree relatives. Gastroscopy provides an important tool not only for the early detection of gastric cancer in populations of high risk (such as that of San Marino), but also for providing clues to the genetic and environmental factors in gastric neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide, a 37-amino-acid neuropeptide, has been shown to be widely distributed in periadventitial nerves throughout the cardiovascular system, particularly in association with coronary arteries. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that calcitonin gene-related peptide possesses potent vasodilator properties. Circulating calcitonin gene-related peptide is derived primarily from periadventitial nerves, though its systemic and regional hemodynamic effects are unknown. In this study, systemic and regional hemodynamics were determined by the radioactive microsphere technique prior to and following the intravenous administration of 65-pmol and 2.2-nmol doses of calcitonin gene-related peptide and vehicle to three groups of conscious, unrestrained rats. Vehicle administration did not change any systemic or regional organ hemodynamic parameter determined. In contrast, 65 pmol and 2.2 nmol of calcitonin gene-related peptide significantly decreased mean blood pressure and total peripheral resistance and increased heart rate in a dose-dependent manner, while only slightly increasing cardiac output. Both 65-pmol and 2.2-nmol doses of calcitonin gene-related peptide significantly increased blood flow (percentage of cardiac output) to the heart. There was no difference in blood flow to the heart between the two doses. In addition, the 2.2-nmol dose of calcitonin gene-related peptide significantly increased blood flow to the stomach, liver, and skin and decreased it to the brain, kidneys, and spleen. In conclusion, calcitonin gene-related peptide infusion decreases blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner primarily by peripheral vasodilation. In addition, calcitonin gene-related peptide selectively changes regional organ blood flow, particularly to cause coronary vasodilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

EDRF stimulates cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) accumulation and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle in a manner similar to that produced by sodium nitroprusside. Endothelium and vascular smooth muscle were isolated from porcine, bovine, and rat thoracic aorta. The capacity of sodium nitroprusside to stimulate cGMP accumulation in cultured bovine, porcine, and rat vascular smooth muscle was found to increase with time in culture to a maximum of 12 to 14 days after plating. In addition, bovine and porcine vascular smooth muscle, but not rat vascular smooth muscle, lost the sodium nitroprusside-stimulated cGMP response after the fifth passage. Cultured endothelial cells did not respond to endothelium-dependent vasodilators or sodium nitroprusside with increased cGMP levels. Vascular smooth muscle cells responded only to sodium nitroprusside. Mixed cultures of porcine and bovine endothelium and vascular smooth muscle and bovine endothelium and rat vascular smooth muscle responded to endothelium-dependent vasodilators with increased cGMP levels. Short-term (4 hours) coculture experiments using bovine endothelium grown on microcarriers to assess the need for long-term contact between the two cell types produced similar results. Release of EDRF from bovine endothelium was studied by loading endothelium-covered microcarrier beads into a column superfused with physiological buffer. Treatment of the column with bradykinin, the calcium ionophore A23187, melittin, and arachidonate released EDRF from the column as measured by cGMP changes in denuded aortic rings and vascular smooth muscle cells and by relaxation of rings when bathed in column effluent. The time course of cGMP changes and relaxation were similar and could be reversed by hydroquinone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The subjects had strong, selective, and reproducible muscular contractions that increased in strength during the twenty-two to forty-four months (average, thirty-two months) of training with the regimen. A basic pattern of stimulation was adapted for each individual; each step was initiated by the subject using a hand-operated switch. The subjects progressed to the use of a walker for support, and two of them were able to walk using axillary crutches. Three subjects were able to climb stairs.\r"

Direct repair was attempted in seven patients, two of whom had no prosthetic material present and survived. Five patients had prosthetic grafts which were not removed and four died from recurrent aortic haemorrhage. There were five other patients who had prosthetic grafts which were removed prior to extra-anatomic reconstruction. Three of these died in the peri-operative period, two from sepsis but only one from aortic stump bleeding. The operative mortality was 58%. The overall survival was only 36% (5 of 14 patients) but there was less chance of recurrent aortic haemorrhage when all prosthetic graft material was removed and direct repair avoided.\r"

Saliva and serum samples were collected simultaneously between 0700 and 1100 h from 57 normal subjects (37 women and 20 men) and from 15 untreated patients (6 women and 9 men) with NC 21-OHD. The salivary (mean +/- SD, 524 +/- 508 pg/mL) and serum (10,548 +/- 5,998 pg/mL) 17-OHP concentrations in all 15 patients were unequivocally higher than the levels in normal subjects (saliva, 51 +/- 24 pg/mL; serum, 1,564 +/- 787 pg/mL). Salivary 17-OHP levels in patients with NC 21-OHD were significantly higher at 0700-0900 h (828 +/- 653 pg/mL) than at 0900-1100 h (314 +/- 227 pg/mL), while no such change was found in normal subjects. The salivary 17-OHP concentration was 1.3-6.9% of its serum concentration, and there was an excellent correlation (r = 0.93) between salivary and serum concentration in both normal subjects and patients with NC 21-OHD. In conclusion, early morning salivary 17-OHP measurement is an excellent screening test for the diagnosis of NC 21-OHD, since it accurately reflects serum 17-OHP levels, and sample collection is easy and noninvasive. We propose that salivary 17-OHP determination be used in population screening programs for NC 21-OHD to establish the true frequency of this disease.\r"

Serum adrenal androgen concentrations [dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and delta 4-androstenedione (delta 4-A)] rose in response to oral administration of metyrapone (450 mg/m2 X dose, every h for 7 doses) in ACTH-intact hypopituitary children with multiple or isolated pituitary hormone deficiencies [mean postmaryrapone level: DHEA, 225 ng/dL (range, 27-566); delta 4-A, 313 ng/dL (range, 105-651)], except in 2 young children in whom DHEA did not rise. These adrenal androgens did not rise in all ACTH-deficient hypopituitary children [mean postmetyrapone level: DHEA, 11.0 ng/dL (range, 3-16); delta 4-A, 6.2 ng/dL (range, 3-10)]. The increases in both serum cortisol and adrenal androgens, including DHEA sulfate, in response to short term ACTH infusion (40 U in 6 h) in ACTH-intact hypopituitary children were normal or above normal, while these steroid responses were significantly (P less than 0.05-0.01) lower in ACTH-deficient hypopituitary children compared to normal values. However, prolonged administration of ACTH (40 U/day, or im) for 6 days to 2 ACTH-deficient hypopituitary children resulted in normal DHEA responses to the 6-h ACTH stimulation test (DHEA levels after the first test, 14 and 30 ng/dL, after priming, 80 and 50 ng/dL). Furthermore, CRH administration to 4 ACTH-deficient patients caused a rise in serum DHEA and cortisol in patients with a normal ACTH response, while those with a poor ACTH response had a lesser rise in DHEA and cortisol. These data suggest that ACTH is the major tropic hormone for adrenal androgen secretion.\r"

Serum immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) levels were significantly higher during pregnancy than in nonpregnant women [97 +/- 5 vs. 56 +/- 4 ng/L (mean +/- SE); P less than 0.001]. No significant correlations were found between maternal osteocalcin concentrations and serum phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, or iPTH, but significant negative correlations were found between osteocalcin and total calcium or total protein. Osteocalcin concentrations in midtrimester amniotic fluid were very low (mean, 0.3 +/- 0.1 ng/mL; n = 11).

In addition to its expression in abnormal lymphocytes, increased accumulation of c-myc mRNA occurs rapidly in normal B- and T-lymphocytes after stimulation with appropriate mitogens. The mechanisms that mediate these mitogen-induced elevations in c-myc mRNA levels, however, have not been determined for normal B and T cells. By using enriched populations of B- and T-lymphocytes obtained from freshly isolated human tonsils and stimulated with Staphylococcus-A or with phytohemagglutinin, respectively, we observed marked elevations (20-40-fold) in the steady state levels of accumulated c-myc messenger RNA (mRNA) within 1 h of exposure of cells to mitogens; modest increases (three- to fivefold) in the relative rate of transcription of the c-myc gene through protein synthesis-independent (cycloheximide-insensitive) mechanisms; and rapid rates of degradation of mature c-myc mRNAs through protein synthesis-dependent (cycloheximide-sensitive) mechanisms. These findings corroborate previous studies in other cell types and provide evidence for both transcriptional and posttranscriptional control of c-myc proto-oncogene expression in normal human lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of nonmitochondrial Ca2+ pumping sites and the site of action of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 1,4,5-P3) were studied in subcellular fractions of human neutrophils. In homogenates, two different Ca2+ pools could be observed: a mitochondrial Ca2+ pool and a nonmitochondrial, ATP-dependent, Ins 1,4,5-P3-responsive Ca2+ pool. When the homogenate was separated into microsomes, primary granules, and secondary granules, the nonmitochondrial Ca2+ pumping and the Ins 1,4,5-P3-induced Ca2+ release occurred only in the microsomal fraction. In a gradient developed to separate different microsomal organelles, maximal Ca2+ pumping activity occurred in fractions of low densities. Correlations between Ca2+ uptake and organelle markers were negative for the endoplasmic reticulum (r = -0.49) and positive for plasma membrane (r = 0.47), Golgi (r = 0.62), and endosomes (r = 0.96). Because the Ca2+ pumping organelles in these fractions were insensitive to micromolar vanadate and digitonin treatment, they are unlikely to be plasma membrane vesicles. We conclude first that microsomal fractions of human neutrophils contain organelles that lower the ambient free Ca2+ concentration and respond to Ins 1,4,5-P3. Second, granules are not involved in intracellular Ca2+ regulation in neutrophils. Third, nonendoplasmic reticulum organelles, such as endosomes, Golgi elements, or yet undefined specialized structures, play a major role in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in human neutrophils.\r"

Antinuclear antibodies were commonly present in the paraprotein sera by indirect immunofluorescence. 19 of 143 sera (13%) had elevated anti-Ro/SSA activity in a solid phase Ro/SSA binding assay, and 5 (3.5%) had Ro/SSA precipitating autoantibody. Eighteen sera had La/SSB binding autoantibodies (12%) but only one had an anti-La/SSB precipitin. Anti-nRNP(Sm) was not detected in any of these sera. The solid phase anti-RNA protein assays were repeated using anti-lambda and anti-kappa conjugates. Both lambda and kappa light chain autoantibodies were found in all positive sera consistent with polyclonal anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB responses. Paraprotein sera containing Ro/SSA precipitins were analyzed by isoelectric focusing followed by exposure to 125I-labeled Ro/SSA and autoradiography. All sera with anti-Ro/SSA binding paraproteins also contained polyclonal anti-Ro/SSA. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that anti-Ro/SSA paraproteins are common and arise from a previously present polyclonal anti-Ro/SSA response.\r"

In contrast, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are well-known to regulate the formation of myeloid cells and their precursors. Because osteoclasts and myeloid cells may originate from a common stem cell, we examined the effects of two CSFs, granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and interleukin 3 (IL-3), on bone resorption, osteoclast formation, and the incorporation of recently replicated nuclei into the osteoclasts of mouse bone cultures. CSFs had little effect on the formation rate of osteoclasts or their resorptive activity but significantly decreased the percentage of recently replicated osteoclast progenitor cell nuclei present in the osteoclasts of bones treated with parathyroid hormone. GM-CSF also increased the number of myeloid cells in the marrow space of the cultures and the percentage of these cells derived from recently replicated progenitors. These results demonstrate that GM-CSF and IL-3 can regulate the development of osteoclasts from recently replicated precursor cells in cultured fetal mouse long bones. However, the mechanisms by which CSFs influence osteoclast formation are difficult to determine from these studies because markers for the osteoclast progenitor and precursor do not exist. These data also provide evidence that the differentiation of osteoclast progenitors is regulated by different factors at different points in their ontogeny.\r"

The effects of EGF-URO, which exhibited tachyphylaxis, could not be attributed either to recirculating EGF-URO or to the secondary release of other agonists or products of the cyclooxygenase pathway. Two vascular beds (FEM, SMA) showed a high maximum responsiveness to EGF-URO (maximum effect [Emax] approximately equal to 70% increase in flow) whereas another group (CAC, COR, CAR, and REN) exhibited lower responsiveness (Emax approximately equal to 20%). The ED50 for this effect of EGF-URO was in the range of 0.4 micrograms (FEM, SMA, CAR, and COR) to 0.9 micrograms (CAC and REN). In isolated dog COR helical strips, EGF-URO did not exhibit either a direct relaxing or a contractile effect. However, preincubation of strips with EGF-URO caused up to a 66% inhibition of contraction in response to norepinephrine (1 microM), with an ED50 for EGF-URO of 1 nM. This action of EGF-URO also showed marked tachyphylaxis. Our data point to a potential role for EGF-URO (and possibly for the structurally related alpha-transforming growth factor) in the regulation of blood flow in vivo.\r"

To determine whether absorptive cells of suckling rat ileum conduct selective transepithelial transport of EGF, we followed uptake of 125I-EGF from ileal loops by autoradiography and biochemical methods. Specific binding sites for 125I-EGF were localized by electron microscope autoradiography on apical membranes of ileal epithelial sheets in vitro. During uptake in vivo, radiolabeled molecules were concentrated in apical endosomal compartments and were also associated with lysosomal vacuoles, basolateral cell surfaces, and lamina propria. Excess cold EGF reduced basolateral label by 44% and TCA precipitable serum label by 38%. After 30 and 60 min of continuous uptake, radiolabeled molecules in epithelium, denuded mucosa, blood, and liver were analyzed under reducing conditions by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Although considerable degradation of 125I-EGF occurred after uptake from the lumen, a portion of radiolabel in epithelium and mucosa represented 125I-EGF which eluted somewhat more rapidly from C18 HPLC columns and showed a slight decrease in apparent molecular weight by SDS-PAGE. All radiolabel in blood and liver represented breakdown products. Thus, EGF is selectively transported across the ileal epithelium in suckling rats but is modified during transport. Milk EGF may accumulate in the lamina propria where it could influence growth and maturation of the suckling intestine.\r"

The binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to plasma membranes prepared from placentas of control and streptozotocin-diabetic fetuses has been characterized on days 17 and 21 of gestation. Results from competitive binding data analyzed by Scatchard analysis indicate the presence of a single class of receptors on day 17 (KD = 5.4 X 10(-10)) and the appearance of a second class of binding sites for 125I-EGF by day 21 (Kd = 3.5 X 10(-9)) in membranes from control fetuses. Placental membranes from diabetic fetuses show decreased specific binding (approximately 30%) on both days and the absence of a second class of binding sites on day 21 of gestation. Results from a radioreceptor assay indicate that the quantity of EGF in the serum of fetuses removed from control rats on day 21 is twofold greater than the quantity in serum of fetuses from diabetic rats. These data reveal a developmental increase in EGF-binding sites in the placenta of normal, near-term fetal rats, largely because of the appearance of a second class of binding sites with a lower affinity for EGF. The failure (or delay) of this second class to develop in the diabetic may be important for the control of maturation and growth of this tissue.\r"

  ".U": "87251753\r", 
  ".W": "In a previous study, a significant inverse relation was found between the luminal size of aortocoronary venous bypass grafts and the vascular resistance of the coronary region that was perfused by the bypass graft in late stages after bypass surgery. This observation suggested that changes in the graft-dependent vascular area could influence the luminal size of the vein graft, even when they occurred several years after operation. Whereas it is well established today that aortocoronary vein grafts often decrease in luminal diameter after implantation, an increase in the bypass lumen has so far not been reported. Therefore, changes in luminal diameter of 27 vein grafts in 21 patients who underwent at least two postoperative angiographic studies (first study 8 +/- 5 months after surgery, second study 58 +/- 32 months after surgery) were compared with the size of the vascular region supplied by the bypass. The graft diameter was found to be unchanged between the two studies (3.3 +/- 0.6 versus 3.4 +/- 0.7 mm, p = NS) when the dependent vascular area was unchanged. A significant increase in graft diameter from 2.8 +/- 0.8 to 3.9 +/- 0.9 mm (p less than 0.001) was observed in nine patients in whom the area of perfusion had increased between the two studies because of the development of occlusion or obstruction of major coronary branches that were now perfused from the grafted vessel by way of collateral vessels. These data support the contention that the luminal size of aortocoronary vein grafts can adapt to the needs of the dependent myocardial vascular region even late after operation rather than being the result of a nonreversible degenerative process as commonly assumed.\r"

In the early series, 414 patients (36%) had preoperative coronary arteriography (group 1): group 1A (n = 224) did not have coronary artery disease, group 1B (n = 78) had coronary artery disease but did not undergo bypass grafting and group 1C (n = 112) had coronary artery disease and underwent bypass grafting. The 742 patients in group 2 did not have preoperative arteriography. Operative mortality rates (30 day) in groups 1A, 1B, 1C and 2 were 4.5, 10.3, 6.3 and 6.3%, respectively (p = NS). The 10 year survival in both groups 1 and 2 was 54%; in groups 1A, 1B and 1C it was 63, 36 and 49%, respectively (1A and 1B, p less than 0.01). In the late series, the 227 patients were divided into similar groups (group 1A, n = 73; 1B, n = 32; 1C, n = 99), and 90% had preoperative coronary arteriography. Operative mortality rates (30 day) for groups 1A, 1B and 1C were 1.4, 9.4 and 4.0%, respectively; that for group 2 (no preoperative arteriography, n = 23) was 4.3%. Definition of coronary anatomy by angiography seems important in most patients greater than or equal to 50 years old who are candidates for aortic valve replacement, and bypass grafting is recommended for those with significant coronary artery disease.\r"

Known complement activators zymosan and endotoxin were used as controls. Generation of C3a, C4a, and C5a (determined by radioimmunoassays) occurred with extracts of house dust and Aspergillus more than with house dust mite and ryegrass. Anaphylatoxins were produced both in dose and time-dependent fashions. Serum activated with house dust and Aspergillus extracts induced neutrophil aggregation when this serum was added to neutrophil suspensions. Less aggregation occurred when house dust mite and perennial ryegrass extract-activated sera were added to human neutrophils. We propose that some allergens may induce biologic responses by activation of sera and generation of anaphylatoxins as well as by IgE-mediated responses.\r"

Data presented here indicate that in contrast to cells of mice expressing either the Mlsa or Mlsc allele which respond in mixed leukocyte reactions to cells expressing the Mlsd allelic products, cells from (Mlsa X Mlsc)F1-hybrid mice do not. In addition, the nonresponder phenotype appears to segregate as a single autosomal genetic system in backcross animals. These findings fail to support two recently advanced hypotheses: first, that the Mls locus is nonpolymorphic, or second, that the Mls locus controls differential expression of Ia antigenic determinants. Although the mechanism by which a (responder X responder) converts to a nonresponder remains unknown, three models involving gene complementation are discussed.\r"

Although transferable tolerance was demonstrable 6 to 14 days after treatment of the cell donors with tolerogen, the state of tolerance persisted in the treated mice for at least 43 days. Moreover, an extract prepared by freezing and thawing of the sIg- spleen cells obtained from mice 6 days after treatment with HIgG(mPEG)20 was capable of reducing (greater than 85%) the immune response of normal mice to heat aggregated HIgG. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that similar tolerogenic mPEG derivatives of xenogeneic monoclonal immunoglobulins (XIg) may prove to be useful therapeutic agents in man when administered before treatment with the unmodified XIg.\r"

  ".W": "This paper analyzes the conditions for in vitro tolerization of purified whole T cell populations and the consequences on helper and suppressor T cell functions. Highly purified splenic T cells from adult DBA/2 mice were incubated in vitro for 24 hr with high doses of trinitrophenyl coupled to human gamma-globulins (TNP-HGG). A profound inhibition of the TNP-specific helper function of these T lymphocytes was observed in a cooperative culture with normal purified splenic B cells and TNP-SRBC as antigen. This state of specific unresponsiveness was maintained after trypsin treatment of the cells, at the end of the 24-hr incubation with the tolerogen. We checked that this procedure removed the vast majority of F23.1 T cell receptor determinants from the cells. This result indicates that T cell receptors for antigen were not merely blocked by the tolerogen. In addition, B cells preincubated with tolerized T cells for 24 hr remained as responsive to TNP as B cells mixed with normal T cells in similar conditions. This demonstrates that the decreased response is not the result of secondary B cell tolerization. In addition, anti-Ia monoclonal antibodies were shown to block the induction of tolerance. We also showed that tolerized T cells significantly decreased the anti-TNP response of normal T and B cells in vitro, whereas the anti-SRBC response in the same cultures was unaffected. When tolerized T cells were separated into Lyt-2- and Lyt-2+ cells, it was found that tolerized Lyt-2- cells had lost about 75% of their helper activity and that Lyt-2+ cells suppressed 70% of the response of a normal T and B cell culture. Thus, in vitro induction of T cell tolerance results in a specific T cell unresponsiveness which is due to both helper T cell inactivation and induction of specific suppressor T cells.\r"

We demonstrate that the cells responsible for the induction of TNP-ACAID are non adherent, IA- T cells. This is in contrast to the antigen-presenting cells which induce suppression after the i.v. injection of TNP-Spl which are IA+/I-J+ adherent cells. Furthermore, two T cells within the TNP-Spl population are required to initiate suppression in TNP-ACAID: one is Lyt-1+, and I-J+, the other is Lyt-1+ and reactive with a monoclonal antibody, 14-30, which specifically identifies Ts inducer cells. The antigen specificity of ACAID resides in the 14-30+ T cell, and not the I-J+ cell. Although both cells must be viable to induce suppression, neither they (nor their products) must be in direct contact within the eye; one population may be in the right AC, the other in the left. Our results suggest that it is Ts inducer cells placed into the AC of the eye which initiate TNP-ACAID, and that these cells exit (or secrete Ts factors which exit) the eye to induce Ts effector cells in the spleen.\r"

C57BL/6 (H-2b, Thy-1.2) mice were whole body-irradiated, or were irradiated with shielding over either the thymus or right leg and tail, and were transferred with 1.5 X 10(7) bone marrow cells from B10.Thy-1.1 mice (H-2b, Thy-1.1). At various days after reconstitution, thymus cells from the recipient mice were harvested and a peanut agglutinin low-binding population was isolated. This population was further treated with anti-Thy-1.2 plus complement to remove host-derived cells and was assayed for the frequency of cytotoxic T cell precursors (CTLp) and for the activity of helper T cells (Th). In the thymus of thymus-shielded and irradiated mice, Th activity reached normal control level by day 25, whereas CTLp frequency remained at a very low level during these days. In the thymus of whole body-irradiated mice, generation of CTLp was highly accelerated while that of Th was retarded, the period required for reconstitution being 25 days and more than 42 days for CTLp and Th, respectively. Preferential development of CTLp was also seen in right leg- and tail-shielded (L-T-shielded) and irradiated recipients. Histological observation indicated that Ia+ nonlymphoid cells were well preserved in the thymus of thymus-shielded and irradiated recipients, whereas in L-T-shielded and irradiated recipients, such cells in the medulla were markedly reduced in number. These results suggest strongly that the generation of Th but not CTLp is dependent on radiosensitive thymic component(s), and that such components may represent Ia+ cells themselves in the medulla or some microenvironment related to Ia+ cells.\r"

  ".W": "MRL/lpr mice were used as a model for seeking information on the role of B cells as antigen-presenting cells in vivo. In confirmation of the finding of other workers, MRL/lpr mice with pronounced lymphadenopathy failed to undergo T cell priming in lymph nodes (LN) after s.c. injection of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA): thus, in contrast to normal mice or young MRL/lpr mice, the LN cells from older MRL/lpr mice failed to give secondary T proliferative responses to the injected antigen in vitro. Because previous work from this laboratory has shown that B cells play a major role in priming T cells in LN of normal mice, we tested the possibility that the lack of T cell priming to KLH seen in older MRL/lpr LN reflected the relative paucity of B cells. To test this idea, MRL/LPR mice were injected s.c. with B cells taken from normal or young MRL/lpr mice 1 day before priming with KLH/CFA. In the case of old (20 to 24 wk) MRL/lpr mice with massive lymphadenopathy, prior injection of B cells had virtually no effect in promoting LN priming. In marked contrast, injection of B cells into mice exhibiting less-pronounced LN enlargement (mice tested at 14 to 16 wk) was highly effective in restoring LN priming; before B cell injection, the LN of these mice contained only 2 to 5% B cells. These findings add to the evidence that T cell priming in LN is heavily dependent on the presence of B cells.\r"

Ag.Ab complexes also stimulate the growth of primary cultures of bone marrow cells that have been previously activated with IL 3. Normal bone marrow, IL 2-, and GM-CSF-dependent bone marrow cell lines could bind Ag.Ab complexes, but binding did not result in the induction of lymphokine synthesis or cell growth. Hyperimmune serum from mice also stimulated lymphokine synthesis and cell growth in IL 3-dependent cells, and the stimulatory activity was removed by treatment with Staphylococcus aureus protein A, suggesting the presence of Ag.Ab complexes.\r"

  ".W": "An attempt was made to identify the molecular structures that are present in bacterial LPS and induce the production of intracellular and extracellular pools of IL 1 by peritoneal macrophages of the mouse and by human monocytes. Activities of glycolipids and carbohydrates prepared by synthesis, and structurally related to the hydrophobic (Lipid A) and to the polysaccharide (PS) regions of LPS were compared with those induced by Bordetella pertussis endotoxin and by fragments derived therefrom. Both isolated regions of this LPS (PS and Lipid A) were able to induce IL 1 synthesis by monocytes and macrophages. Among the synthetic glycolipids employed, propyl-2-deoxy-2-[(3R)-3-hydroxytetrade-canamido]-4-O-pho sph ono-6-O-tetradecanoyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (glycolipid M9) induced IL 1 secretion more efficiently than Lipid A and LPS, whereas the amounts of intracellular IL 1 produced upon induction by these three substances were comparable. Macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice were unresponsive to Lipid A and to glycolipid M9, but produced IL 1 when incubated with PS or with a hydrophilic fragment isolated after methanolysis of the endotoxin. However, all synthetic derivatives of 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid (KDO) used in this study failed to induce IL 1 production by both mouse macrophages and human monocytes. The implications of these findings for a more precise comprehension of the molecular mechanism of LPS-induced activation of macrophages, and the relations between the molecular structures required for the induction of IL 1 production vs cytostatic activity in macrophages, are discussed.\r"

Cross-linking of the Thy-1 molecule resulted in IL 2 production by the EL4 thymoma and by a T cell hybridoma, suggesting that Thy-1 may play a role in T lymphocyte triggering. To further study the functional role of this molecule, Thy-1-negative variants were selected and analyzed for IL 2 production in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or to Con A. It was demonstrated that in spite of their failure to express Thy-1, the Thy-1-negative clones were capable of IL 2 production. These results indicated that although Thy-1 cross-linking triggers cell activation, a signal provided by Thy-1 is not indispensable for cell activation by mitogens. The T cell tumor line LBRM331A5 responds synergistically to IL 1 and PHA by releasing IL 2. It was demonstrated that anti Ly-1 monoclonal antibodies and PHA co-stimulated LBRM331A5 cells, as did IL 1 plus PHA. Thus, anti Ly-1 antibodies mimic the effect of IL 1, suggesting a role for Ly-1 antigen in T cell activation, perhaps by serving as an IL 1 receptor or as an associated molecule. To further study the functional role of Ly-1 and its relation to IL 1 receptor, Ly-1-negative variants of the LBRM331A5 cell line were selected and analyzed for IL 2 production in response to PHA plus IL 1. It was demonstrated that the Ly-1-negative clones were capable of IL 2 production as efficiently as Ly-1-positive clones. These results indicate that the Ly-1 and IL 1 receptor are distinct molecules, which are involved in different activation pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 1 (IL 1) is a polypeptide hormone produced by macrophages, keratinocytes, and brain glial cells which acts as a soluble mediator in immunological and inflammatory reactions. Although its best known effect on the central nervous system is its ability to cause fever, it has been found to influence cell growth, food intake, and slow-wave sleep. We have developed a binding assay for 125I-labeled recombinant murine IL 1 and show it to be highly specific. Additionally, affinity cross-linking studies indicate that the rat brain IL 1 receptor has a m.w. of approximately 80,000, which is similar to the previously described recognition molecule on T cells and fibroblasts. Using autoradiographic techniques, we visualized the distribution of 125I-IL 1 binding in sections of fresh frozen rat brain. IL 1 receptors were found to be widespread throughout the brain, forming a distinctive pattern of distribution. Areas especially dense in receptors were typically neuron-rich sites of the brain such as granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, and the granule cell layer of the cerebellum as well as in the hypothalamus. The pattern of IL 1 receptor distribution indicates the presence of receptors on neuron cell bodies and the localization to numerous discrete brain areas other than those hypothalamic sites involved in temperature regulation, suggesting a broader role for IL 1 in brain functioning than previously recognized. IL 1, derived from local or systemic sources, may function in the brain to coordinate behavioral and neuroendocrine activities with immunological and inflammatory reactions throughout the body.\r"

Specificity of the Fd11 TsF for Fd was established by comparing it to another TsF isolated by us (A10 TsF) in a sandwich ELISA, and by demonstrating the specific reactivity to Fd of the hybridoma in calcium flux studies. The Fd11 affinity-purified TsF was shown to contain two major unique components with m.w. in the region of 80,000 and 35,000 when run on reducing polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate. Specific immunosuppressive properties of Fd11 were demonstrated when Fd11 TsF (10 micrograms) was injected i.v. into Fd-primed syngeneic mice at the time of antigen boost. Fd11 TsF specifically and significantly diminished the secondary antibody response to Fd in DBA/2 mice.\r"

We have cloned the murine LT and TNF genes from a lambda:mouse DNA recombinant library, using as probes synthetic oligonucleotides defined by portions of the human LT or TNF cDNA sequences. Analysis of the genomic clones indicates that the LT and TNF genes are physically linked, i.e., approximately 1.2 kb separates the 3' end of LT from the 5' end of TNF genes. By using, first, a series of recombinant inbred lines, and second, a series of H-2-recombinant congenic strains, we determined that the LT/TNF gene cluster lies on chromosome 17, closely linked to the H-2D end of the murine H-2 complex. Comparison of the primary sequence of murine and human LT revealed that the intron-exon structure of murine LT is similar in these two species. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of murine and human LT indicates that the proteins are about 72% homologous with much greater sequence conservation in regions encoding the COOH-terminal portion. Comparison of the 5' flanking sequence of LT to a number of genes that are specifically expressed in activated T cells reveals a number of conserved sequences that may play a role in control of these genes.\r"

Because specific actions of these hormones are exerted through receptor-mediated mechanisms, we have examined the human thymus gland for the presence of specific high-affinity androgen receptors. Cytosolic extracts of whole human thymus were found to contain 6.5 (+/- 2.6) fmol of specific [3H]methyltrienolone binding per mg protein. The receptor sedimented at 8s on sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis. Thymic fibroblast lines derived from these glands did not express sufficient receptor content to account for the findings in whole thymus cytosolic extracts. Purified thymocyte preparations (greater than 99.3% pure as assessed by flow cytometry with monoclonal anti-thymocyte marker OKT11) contained 3.34 (+/- 1.2) fmol receptor per mg cytosolic protein. Mature peripheral blood lymphocytes, human T cells obtained from thoracic duct drainage, and the human T cell line Jurkat were not found to contain these receptors. These studies demonstrate for the first time that a high affinity androgen receptor is present in maturing human thymocytes. A functional role for these receptors is suggested by dihydrotestosterone-mediated decreases in interleukin 2-like activity produced by cultured human thymocytes.\r"

Monocytes from human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were infected in vitro with L. pneumophila and cultured for 2 days to allow intracellular replication of the bacterium. Cells were then labeled with 51Cr and used as targets in a 4-h 51Cr-release assay. We report here that autologous nonadherent PBL effectively lysed infected monocytes, and this activity was enhanced when the effector cells were precultured with IL 2 for 2 days. The IL 2-activated killer cells were also cytolytic against uninfected cultured monocytes, but cytotoxicity was higher against Legionella-infected target cells in a dose-dependent manner. The effector cells were located in Percoll density fractions that were enriched for large granular lymphocytes. The phenotype of the effector cell activated by IL 2 was determined to be OKM1+, OKT11+, partially Leu-11+, and negative for Leu-M1, OKT4, OKT8, and Leu-7, indicating that it is neither a T cell nor a monocyte, and is possibly and NK subset that is Leu-11+ and Leu-7-. Cold target inhibition studies indicated that a similar recognition structure is shared by both infected and uninfected monocytes, but differs from that on K562 tumor target cells. Thus, in addition to tumor surveillance and controlling viral infections, killer cells can be activated to provide protection against intracellular bacterial infections.\r"

Treatment of the transfectant with anti-T3, anti-mouse Ti-alpha, or anti-human Ti-beta antibodies clears all Ti-T3 complexes from the surface.

The antibody YE6/6 initially produced against Moloney leukemia virus-transformed T lymphoma line MBL-2, reacted with several other lymphoma lines including non-T lymphoma lines as well as thymocytes from leukemic AKR mice, but it did not show significant reactivities with resting or mitogen-activated normal lymphocytes by flow cytometric analysis. The antibody did not bind to some Abelson leukemia-transformed cells, which express Moloney virus antigens, suggesting that the antigen is unlikely to be encoded by Moloney virus genome. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the antigen molecules immunoprecipitated by the antibody revealed three major polypeptides. Two of the polypeptides, with approximate m.w. of 95,000 and 35,000, can be labeled by the cell surface iodination and, therefore, seem to be exposed on the cell surface. The third polypeptide, with approximate m.w. of 65,000, is not labeled by the surface iodination but it is readily detected by [35S]methionine labeling. The third polypeptide was labeled with [32P]orthophosphate indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Western blot analysis showed that YE6/6 antibody primarily reacts with 35,000 m.w. polypeptide. Furthermore, the same 35,000 m.w. protein was also detected in concanavalin A-activated spleen cells at a low level by Western blot, but normal resting lymphocytes were negative. These results suggest that the antigen detected by YE6/6 antibody may be a cell proliferation-associated antigen and its expression is highly elevated on transformed lymphoma cells as compared to normal mitogen-activated lymphocytes.\r"

In this report, we have characterized four monoclonal anti-Z-DNA antibodies from unimmunized MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice that do not cross-react with B-DNA and can discriminate between different types of left-handed helices. Two of the monoclonal antibodies (Za and Zi) behaved similarly in that they bound to two forms of Z-DNA (Br-poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) and AAF-poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) but not to two other Z-form DNA (poly(dG-5BrdC).poly(dG-5BrdC) or poly(dG-5MedC).poly(dG-5MedC)). Neither antibody (Za or Zi) bound significantly to B-DNA or to denatured DNA. A third antibody (Ze) exhibited similar binding characteristics for the Z-DNA preparations, but also recognized denatured DNA. In contrast, a fourth antibody (3-7.3) bound preferentially to poly(dG-5BrC).poly(dG-5BrdC) in Z conformation. These results provide the first evidence for anti-Z-DNA autoantibodies in autoimmune mice that do not cross-react with native or denatured DNA and indicate that these antibodies exhibit considerable heterogeneity in their fine binding specificity.\r"

Over 3.2 +/- 0.4 mo, the untreated group had no significant change in spontaneous lung T cell release of IL 2 or spontaneous proliferation. In contrast, over the same period, the treated group had marked reduction of spontaneous lung T cell release of IL 2 and proliferation (p less than 0.01, all comparisons before therapy). Furthermore, Northern analysis of lung T cell RNA before therapy demonstrated IL 2 mRNA transcripts, whereas no IL 2 transcripts were observed during therapy. These observations are consistent with the concept that directly, or indirectly, corticosteroids are capable of suppressing the IL 2 gene in activated T lymphocytes in vivo.\r"

Radiolabeled BSF1 was efficiently produced in Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with a cloned mRNA for BSF1 and 35S-methionine. The labeled BSF1 specifically bound to splenic B cells. A Scatchard analysis indicated the existence of one class of receptor sites. BSF1 receptors were found to be distributed on a wide range of hematopoietic lineage cells, including B cells, T cells, macrophages, and mast cells. B cells from CBA/N mice with the xid gene defect had a similar level of BSF1 binding capacity compared with BALB/c strain B cells, and responded well to insoluble anti-Ig and BSF1 in proliferation assays, indicating that CBA/N B cells express functional BSF1 receptors at normal levels. Pre-B cell lines showed low levels of BSF1 binding, suggesting that cells in the B cell lineage acquire BSF1 responsiveness early in development.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown recently that monocyte-macrophage cells produce a growth factor (HGF) active on newly formed B cell hybridomas. We have studied the effect of HGF on the proliferation of an HGF-sensitive clone of B cell hybridoma. Results obtained showed that the murine P388D1 cell-derived HGF has a m.w. of 29,000 and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.2 whereas the human monocyte-derived HGF has a m.w. of 34,000 and a pI of 4.9. The HGF activity was not mediated by interleukin 1 because the two activities could be completely separated by gel filtration. Results obtained in in vivo experiments showed that HGF-sensitive cells are tumorigenic in mice. The finding that the HGF biochemical parameters (m.w. and pI) are similar to the ones of a recently described plasmacytoma growth factor suggests that HGF and the plasmacytoma growth factor are similar and that the HGF sensitivity of SP 2/O myeloma cells is reactivated after fusion with normal B lymphocytes.\r"

Concentrations of C3a(C3adesArg) of 10(-8) M and 6 hr of culture were sufficient to induce production of cell-associated IL 1, as detected in monocyte lysates. Ten- to 100-fold higher concentrations of C3a(C3adesArg) and 24 hr of culture were required for induction of IL 1 release. Release of IL 1 induced by suboptimal amounts of C3a(C3adesArg) was greatly enhanced by the addition of indomethacin to the culture medium. Contamination with C5a of the C3a(C3adesArg) preparation did not account for C3a(C3adesArg)-induced IL 1 production. Induction of IL 1 activity by C3a(C3adesArg) was not due to contaminating LPS, as indicated by the following observations: the amount of contaminating LPS in C3a(C3adesArg) was below that which could induce IL 1 release from human monocytes in serum-free conditions; induction of IL 1 by C3a(C3adesArg) was not suppressed by polymyxin B; kinetics of IL 1 production and release in the presence of C3a(C3adesArg) differed from those observed in the presence of LPS; and sialated gangliosides, which inhibit IL 1 release induced by LPS, had no effect on the induction of IL 1 by C3a(C3adesArg). The C3a(C3adesArg) preparation used in this study mostly contained the desArg derivative, suggesting that, in contrast with the requirement for an intact C-terminal arginyl residue for the spasmogenic activity of C3a, both C3a and its C3adesArg derivative may interact with receptors on human monocytes. By inducing IL 1 production and release, C3a(C3adesArg) may contribute to the generation of the inflammatory process and the regulation of the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "The stimulating effect of a synthetic nonapeptide (fragment 163-171) of human interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) on antibody responses to both T helper-dependent and T helper-independent antigens was investigated. It was shown that the nonapeptide enhanced the antibody response, as evaluated in the hemolytic plaque assay, of spleen cells from mice immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC). The activity of the 163-171 peptide on the primary response to SRBC was dose-dependent, being maximal when the peptide was inoculated at 100 mg/kg together with the antigen. Moreover, the 163-171 peptide was also effective in enhancing the secondary response to SRBC. The effect of the 163-171 peptide was to augment the frequency of cells specific for the antigen, inasmuch as no increase was ever observed in spleen cell numbers after treatment. In all these studies, human recombinant IL-1 beta gave effects qualitatively comparable to those of the 163-171 peptide, with a maximal activity at 20 ng/kg. Both the 163-171 peptide and human recombinant IL-1 beta were also able to enhance the in vivo immune response to a T helper-independent antigen such as SIII, a poorly immunogenic polysaccharidic antigen from Streptococcus pneumoniae type III. It can therefore be proposed that this synthetic nonapeptide of human IL-1 beta may represent a good candidate for use as adjuvant in vaccines.\r"

These clones displayed three distinct reaction patterns when tested for their lytic ability against target cells expressing various structurally defined HLA-B27 subtypes. One of the clones was specific for HLA-B27.1; a second CTL clone reacted only with B27.1 and, less efficiently, with B27.2; the third clone recognized both B27.1 and B27f targets but not cells expressing any other B27 subtype. These results indicate that HLA-B27f is a functional variant amenable to differential recognition by alloreactive CTL. A correlation of the structure of the HLA-B27 subtypes with the reactivity of these clones revealed that multiple B27-specific alloreactive CTL are activated against epitopes of the HLA-B27.1 molecule sharing common structural features. This illustrates the complexity and fine specificity of the allogeneic CTL response against class I HLA antigens and suggests that their immunodominant regions are those which are capable of eliciting a diverse polyclonal response against each of these regions, rather than inducing the selective expansion of a single T cell clone.\r"

Pairwise comparison of the eight unique sequences shows that point mutation, reciprocal recombination, and gene conversion have all contributed significantly to the diversification of this family of alleles. These results are compared with those of other studies that have emphasized the role of gene conversion. A predominance of coding substitutions in the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains is found, consistent with positive selection for polymorphism being a major factor in the fixation of these alleles. In the three cases examined, genes for phenotypically identical proteins gave identical nucleotide sequences, indicating that most, if not all, of the class I polymorphism is detectable by immunological methods. The apparent stability of the sequences suggests that the events generating some of the alleles occurred before the origin of modern Homo sapiens.\r"

Membranes were prepared by differential centrifugation of sonicates of normal murine B cells. Incubation of these membranes with 32P-adenosine triphosphate in the presence of Mg2+ effected the radiolabeling of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdInsP). Alternately, membranes were labeled with exogenous 3H(inositol)-PtdInsP2 in sodium cholate. Stimulation of labeled membranes with anti-immunoglobulin, but not anti-Ia or anti-H2 antibodies, resulted in hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol, PdtInsP, PtdInsP2 and generation of inositol phosphates indicative of activation of a phospholipase C. The response was rapid, being detectable within 30 sec of stimulation, and independent of Ca2+ and guanosine 5'-triphosphate. Optimal responses were dependent on the presence of a cytosolic factor presumed to be phospholipase C. Development of these systems represents an important step towards reconstitution of membrane immunoglobulin-mediated transmembrane signaling in artificial membranes.\r"

A synergistic effect was also seen when similar experiments were performed in nude mice. In vitro antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays showed that IL 2 enhanced antibody-mediated lysis by peritoneal cells exposed to IL 2 in vitro in a dose-related manner. Peritoneal cells harvested from mice treated in vivo with IL 2 contained an increased number of T cells and asialo GM+ natural killer cells, and also mediated enhanced ADCC. Depletion of natural killer cells with anti-asialo GM and complement resulted in a marked decrease in the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity mediated by these peritoneal cells. The mechanism of synergy between monoclonal antibody and IL 2 may be due to the direct or indirect activation of natural killer cells mediating ADCC.\r"

Recently, however, IL 2-activated NK cells were suggested as the major source of LAK reactivity in human peripheral blood (PBL). Because certain T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells are phenotypically similar to LAK precursors, we have asked whether these leukemic cells can be induced toward LAK-cytotoxicity and express NK reactivity before stimulation. Five out of seven T-ALL preparations were induced by IL 2 to kill target cells. The cytotoxicity of the leukemic-LAK cells resembled that of normal LAK effectors as they lysed efficiently the NK-resistant target Daudi, as well as fresh human sarcoma, carcinoma, and renal cancer cells but not normal PBL. The ALL-LAK precursors phenotype was T3-, T4-, T8-, and T11+, similar to most normal LAK precursors. In contrast to normal PBL that generated LAK effectors when their proliferation was inhibited, the irradiated, nonproliferating T-ALL leukemic cells did not respond to IL 2. Therefore, the T-ALL LAK cytotoxicity was attributed to the leukemic cells rather than to residual normal lymphocytes. The IL 2-responding T-ALL cells did not express autonomous NK type cytotoxicity, suggesting that they reflect LAK precursors of non-NK origin. The homogeneous leukemic preparations with inducible LAK cytotoxicity described herein provide a model system for studying normal LAK cells.\r"

Transforming growth factor-beta increased collagen synthesis to the same extent in both PSS and normal fibroblasts, whereas EGF had no stimulatory activity on collagen synthesis. The addition of EGF to cultures incubated with TGF-beta led to a decrease in collagen synthesis compared with the effect seen with TGF-beta alone (p less than 0.02). These studies suggest that TGF-beta may play an important role in the accumulation of connective tissue seen in PSS and that the combined action of multiple growth factors may modulate the synthetic activity of human dermal fibroblasts.\r"

Suction blisters were performed on abdominal skin and LC isolated on the basis of their attachment to IgG-coated erythrocyte monolayers. Antigen-presenting function of purified LC was studied by measuring the proliferation of HSV-stimulated T cells. Langerhans cells were also used to stimulate T cells in autologous mixed cell reaction (AMCR). In addition, the production of epidermal cell thymocyte-activating factor (ETAF) by crude epidermal cells was measured. The HSV-induced T-cell proliferation in AD + HSV and AD patients was comparable with that of controls. The AMCR responses of patients with AD + HSV and AD were clearly diminished when compared with healthy controls. Patients with AD also produced significantly less ETAF than controls. Our results suggest that HSV antigen-presenting function of LC from patients with AD + HSV seems to be intact. Defective AMCR may reflect an abnormality in autoregulation and generation of effector cells and this together with decreased ETAF production may have pathogenetic significance in AD.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies demonstrated that psoralen plus long-wave ultraviolet radiation (PUVA) treatment inhibited certain T-lymphocyte functions, such as locomotive ability. To further analyze the effects of PUVA on T-lymphocyte function, we investigated the ability of mouse spleen cells to produce interleukin 2 (IL-2) after treatment of the mice in vivo with PUVA. Interleukin 2 production was impaired in cells from PUVA-treated mice compared with those from UVA-irradiated, 8-methoxypsoralen-treated, or normal mice. This impairment was not dose dependent, over the dose range of UVA (2-20 J/cm2) examined. Interleukin 2 production was markedly suppressed on day 3 after PUVA and returned to normal by day 7 after the treatment. Topical treatment of the mice with croton oil did not affect IL-2 production of their spleen cells. This result indicates that cutaneous inflammation per se may not be responsible for the suppressive effect of PUVA on IL-2 production. Addition of exogenous IL-1 did not reconstitute the decreased ability of spleen cells to produce IL-2 in vitro, indicating that PUVA affected primarily IL-2 producing cells. These suggest that impaired IL-2 production may account for some of the immune dysfunction observed in PUVA-treated animals.\r"

Although the clinical effect of an acute UV exposure such as cutaneous inflammation, malaise, somnolence, chills, and fever have been appreciated for many years, the underlying mechanisms mediating these effects are poorly understood. Since chills and fever are the most dramatic systemic sequelae after a prolonged exposure to UV, we specifically examined the effect of whole-body UV irradiation on core body temperature and serum endogenous pyrogen activity of New Zealand White rabbits, correlating this with serum interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity and alterations of serum divalent cation levels. We found that an acute dose of UV irradiation (Westinghouse FS-40 lamps, 0.2 mJ/cm2/s X 8 h) resulted in a significant increase in the core body temperature 2 h post UV (0.8 degree C), peaking 5 h post UV (1.8 degree C), and returning to normal 24 h post UV. Likewise, the sera from the UV-irradiated rabbits had significant endogenous pyrogen activity when transferred into naive recipient animals, causing an increase in core body temperature within 45 min (0.65 +/- 0.12 degree C), decreasing over the next 2 h, and returning to normal 6 h post injection. No endotoxin contamination was detected in any serum samples. This post-UV febrile response was accompanied by a prolonged increase in serum IL-1 activity (5-10 X) and a significant alteration in serum divalent cation levels, with the rabbits becoming euthermic even as the serum IL-1 levels remained elevated. These findings provide new information concerning the pathogenesis and kinetics of these systemic effects after an acute dose of UV irradiation.\r"

Cryostat sections from 11 biopsies from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and from 11 lichen planus biopsy specimens were submitted to indirect immunofluorescence and a 4-step immunoperoxidase method. This consists of applying monoclonal antibodies recognizing HLA-DR and HLA-DQ molecules and the intracytoplasmic invariant chain of the class II molecules. In 8 of the 11 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma specimens and in 3 of the 11 lichen planus biopsies concomitant expression of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ molecules by keratinocytes was detectable with the immunoperoxidase method. However, with the indirect immunofluorescence technique HLA-DQ antigens on keratinocytes could not be detected. The simultaneous expression of surface-bound HLA-DR antigens and intracytoplasmic gamma-chains was demonstrable in all cases investigated and with both the immunohistologic methods applied.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested that T lymphocytes with helper phenotype may play an important role in the pathogenesis of lichenoid tissue reactions (LTR). In order to elucidate whether murine self-Ia-specific autoreactive T cells with helper phenotype can induce LTR in naive syngeneic hosts, two clones of autoreactive cloned T cells with both helper and cytotoxic activities, capable of producing the cytotoxic lymphokines gamma interferon and lymphotoxin in response to self-Ia antigens, were examined for their ability to induce LTR. One clone, BB5, when injected into footpads of syngeneic hosts, induced prominent epidermotropic cellular infiltrates that led to basal vacuolar degeneration and Civatte body formation; the other clone, C10, did not. No difference between BB5 and C10 was detected with respect to their ability to induce delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Immunohistochemical studies using anti-Lyt monoclonal antibodies showed that BB5-induced LTR was induced by the epidermal invasion of the injected BB5 cells themselves. We further observed that the infusion of BB5 cells not only resulted in Ia antigen expression on keratinocytes, but was also accompanied by a morphologic change in Langerhans cells at 24 h, when the epidermal invasion had not yet developed. However, similar observations were also observed with C10 cells, indicating that Ia expression on keratinocytes may not be a prerequisite for the induction of LTR.\r"

Several cases have been putatively associated with Hodgkin's disease, and histologic similarities to mycosis fungoides have also been noted. We examined tissue from 3 cases of GSS to determine whether the condition was inflammatory or lymphoproliferative in nature. We found an abnormal, monomorphous T-helper cell immunophenotype, and in all 3 cases, clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta gene. We conclude that GSS is an indolent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma associated with granulomatous inflammation that mediates elastolysis, producing a distinctive clinical appearance.\r"

Abnormal multipolypoid forms herniating through large gaps in the basal lamina have been found to characterize biopsies from psoriatic patients with concomitant alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, and appear to be a marker of excessive proteolytic activity. The finding of similar multipolypoid BKH in patients with generalized pustular psoriasis of the von Zumbusch variety (but not in patients with psoriasis vulgaris), in the absence of concomitant alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, would support the concept of the presence of large amounts of proteolytic enzymes in the dermis of patients with this syndrome. The large proportion of BKH directly associated with dermal neutrophils, and the presence of clusters of high-density BKH overlying collections of dermal neutrophils, suggests that neutrophilic proteases are largely responsible for BKH formation in patients with this syndrome.\r"

The platelet receptor for vWF contains a membrane protein termed glycoprotein Ib. Modification of only one or two amino groups per vWF subunit caused a 50% reduction in the platelet-agglutinating activity of vWF, and a decrease in its ability to bind to platelets. All multimeric forms of vWF are modified. Loss of platelet-agglutinating activity on modification of less than 2% of the amino groups on each vWF subunit suggests that the amino groups in the glycoprotein Ib-binding domain of vWF are both particularly reactive and essential for its function.\r"

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a cytokine that mediates many aspects of the acute phase response, and rats with experimental head injury produce IL-1 of brain origin. IL-1 administered intracerebroventricularly to experimental animals has disproportionately greater systemic biologic effects compared with IL-1 injected intravenously. In this study, patients with severe head injury were evaluated to determine whether IL-1 activity in the ventricular fluid was increased and whether IL-1 levels correlated with some of the altered metabolic responses. Twelve hospitalized patients with head injury (24-hour peak admission Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 4 to 10) were evaluated on admission and longitudinally for 21 days after injury. IL-1 activity in ventricular fluid from patients with head injury was significantly elevated whereas IL-1 activity in cerebrospinal fluid from age- and sex-matched patients undergoing lumbar puncture for myelograms was not detectable (P less than 0.005). The patients with head injury had clinical and biochemical indicators of IL-1 activity such as fever, hypozincemia, and increased C-reactive protein levels that improved during the period of hospitalization. It is speculated that the elevated IL-1 activity may play a role in the altered metabolic response of patients with severe head injury.\r"

This action of beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin is mediated through naloxone-insensitive receptors on the mesangial cell, because naloxone treatment of the kidney cells does not abrogate this activity. The studies delineate a novel mechanism by which a neuropeptide may influence the development of immune-mediated cellular pathology.\r"

When doubt still exists, further extra-axial X-ray films can be helpful. Although most patients have been treated surgically, there may be a role for conservative therapy initially, as surgery in elderly DISH patients is often morbid and even fatal. A 79-year-old patient with DISH (Forestier's disease) is reported. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy was successfully implemented. DISH is compared with other disorders of the cervical spine which may cause dysphagia.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose utilization by normal and neoplastic cerebral tissue can be measured in humans using positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18-labeled 2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). Malignant gliomas are known to exhibit hypermetabolic glucose consumption compared to normal brain. Barbiturate-sensitive cerebral glucose utilization is coupled to neuronal activity, and lesions lacking neuronal activity should be relatively insensitive to barbiturate suppression of glucose utilization. In a study to examine this phenomenon, three patients with cerebral gliomas underwent FDG-PET while awake and during deep barbiturate coma. Cerebral glucose utilization was measured in normal brain, tumor, and a homologous, non-neoplastic control site in the contralateral hemisphere. A glucose utilization ratio for tumor/control tissue was calculated. The mean reduction of glucose utilization during barbiturate coma was: gray matter 67%, white matter 47%, basal ganglia 66%, thalamus 57%, cerebellar cortex 55%, tumor 32%, and the contralateral control site 64%. The mean tumor glucose utilization ratio was 1.48:1 in the awake state and 2.69:1 during barbiturate coma. The changes in gray matter, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellar cortex, and tumor/control tissue ratio were significant (p less than 0.05). In one patient, deep tumor invasion not evident on computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or baseline FDG-PET was apparent during barbiturate-enhanced FDG-PET scanning. The study findings suggest that gliomas resist suppression of glucose utilization by barbiturates; this supports the hypothesis that barbiturates reduce neuronal metabolism by blocking synaptic activity. This differential effect on normal brain and gliomas enhances the capability to assess the extent of neoplastic tissue in brain and may represent the basis for novel therapeutic strategies.\r"

  ".W": "The responsiveness of T cells and their subsets (T-helper cells and T-suppressor cells) obtained from patients with malignant gliomas was evaluated in an effort to further define the mechanism of their impaired host immunocompetence. This study demonstrates that peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from these patients have impaired responsiveness to a variety of mitogens including phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen, and anti-T3 monoclonal antibody. The impaired lymphocyte responsiveness does not result from the inability of these cells to express receptors for a specific mitogen or antibody. The mitogenic responsiveness of purified T cells is markedly reduced when compared to values obtained from control subjects. Therefore, the decreased T cell reactivity of patients with malignant gliomas does not result simply from a diminution in the absolute number of potentially responding lymphocytes. The mitogen reactivity of the T cell subsets, CD4+ helper cells, and CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor cells was also investigated. These results demonstrate that the responsiveness of the CD4+ T-helper cell subset obtained from these patients is consistently diminished as compared to control values. In contrast, the reactivity of the CD8+ T cell subset was not nearly as dramatically impaired. Thus, these results indicate that the proliferative defect observed in T cells obtained from patients is located predominantly in the T-helper cell subset. Functional deficiencies in this important subpopulation of T lymphocytes may explain, in part, the presence of depressed immune responsiveness in patients with malignant glial tumors.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine the mechanisms underlying hearing deficits incurred as a result of manipulations in the CPA. Compound action potentials (CAP) were recorded from the cochlear nerve in response to click stimulation before, during, and after cerebellar and eighth nerve retractions were performed under anesthesia. The retractions were carried out to elicit different degrees of change in the latency and waveform of the CAP. About 30 minutes after completion of the manipulations, the dogs were perfused with a fixative and their cochlear nerves and brain stems were prepared for histological studies. The results showed that retraction of the eighth nerve caused a disintegration of the myelin sheath, and there were multiple and extensive foci of petechial hemorrhage and thromboses of the vasa nervorum of the cochlear nerve. In two dogs in which retraction was carried to a point at which the N2 peak of the CAP was abruptly obliterated, there was a separation of the central and peripheral myelin junction (Obersteiner-Redlich (OR) zone) and bleeding from the vasa nervorum at the OR zone. In the dogs in which the changes in the CAP had almost recovered before fixative perfusion, there were petechial hemorrhages within the cochlear nerve trunk, thus showing that improvement of electrophysiological responses may not always correlate with the absence of morphological changes.\r"

Plasminogen activator (PA) activity was assayed electrophoretically on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. The patients were were divided into two groups according to the positivity of their tumors to alpha 1-AT. Sixty-eight percent of the tumors were positive for alpha 1-AT, and all specimens were negative for alpha 2-macroglobulin. Clinical and biological parameters obtained in all study patients failed to show statistically significant differences between the two groups with the exception of PA activity (p = 0.001), the peritumoral edema as seen on computerized tomography, and the preoperative serum fibrinogen level. These three parameters were higher in the group with specimens positive to alpha 1-AT. This study supports the hypothesis that alpha 1-AT is produced primarily by tumor cells in proportion to the regional proteolytic and inflammatory activity, and may protect the tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "Positron emission tomography (PET) was used on 16 patients with untreated cerebral gliomas to measure cerebral glucose and oxygen metabolism, oxygen extraction, blood flow, and blood volume. In addition, pH values were obtained for seven cases. Gliomas were later proven by biopsy; two patients had tumors with degrees of malignancy of grade II, two patients had grade III, and 12 patients had grade IV tumors. Compared with homologous gray matter regions in the opposite hemisphere, tumor tissue showed increased blood volume, but decreased oxygen extraction and oxygen metabolism. Compared with grade II tumors, grade IV tumors demonstrated higher blood volumes, but lower relative oxygen extraction and utilization. Tumor blood flow was variable, but was lower in the higher grade tumors. Rates of glucose utilization in tumor, calculated by using individually determined rate constants, were variable, and did not correlate with tumor size or tumor grade. Parietal tumors (n = 6) tended to have higher relative glucose utilization and blood flow, and lower relative oxygen extraction, when compared with frontal tumors (n = 4). Tumor pH differed significantly from the pH in contralateral brain (p less than 0.005); alkalotic pH values were consistently seen. These findings in and around cerebral gliomas studied before intervention differ from the results found in gliomas after exposure to radiation or chemotherapy.\r"

Compounds 3 and 4 were synthesized by N-alkylation of spiroperidol with NCA 1-bromo-2-[18F]-fluoroethane (2b), 1-[18F]fluoro-3-iodopropane (2c) and 1-bromo-3-[18F]fluoropropane (2d) respectively. The biodistribution of 4 in mice showed that the mouse brain uptake of radioactivity was similar to that of [18F]-N-methylspiroperidol (1.1% of the administered dose), but the activity in bone (femur) increased with time. The kinetic distribution of compound 4 in baboon brain was similar to that of [18F]-N-methylspiroperiodol, and the striatal accumulation of radioactivity was also blocked stereoselectively by butaclamol. The ratio of striatum to cerebellum radioactivities at 3 hr after injection was 5.9. Analysis of the metabolic stability of 4 in mouse brains for 1 hr indicated that, like [18F]-N-methylspiroperidol, it is relatively stable to metabolic transformation in the central nervous system. These results suggest that compound 4 may be a useful radioligand for PET studies of the dopamine receptor in humans.\r"

  ".W": "A number of factors must be considered when forming a digital filter to two-dimensionally filter single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) acquisition images. In an effort to provide subjectively optimal filtering, a program has been developed which provides \"real-time\" visual feedback. This allows a user to select from among a family of Metz filters tailored for the imaging conditions (i.e., formed to deconvolve scatter, septal penetration, and combined collimator and intrinsic spatial resolution losses). Also, a guideline for assisting the user in selecting from among the possible Metz filters has been formulated. This guideline is based upon knowledge of the probability distribution of the noise power spectrum, and consists of choosing the filter which has a value of 1.0 when the one-dimensional compression of the image power spectrum equals the 90% confidence limit for noise fluctuations. The program starts by filtering a planar reference image with the Metz filter computed for the radionuclide, collimator, magnification, and count-level of the image. This filter is displayed beside the image where it is overlayed on a plot of the logarithm of the one-dimensional compression of the image power spectrum. The user is then allowed to vary the filter parameters through movement of a joystick. By doing the filtering using an array processor, a new filtered image is formed and displayed less than a second after movement of the joystick. Visual feedback from the series of filtered images thus produced as well as the plots of the filter overlayed on the estimated blurred object power spectrum are used to obtain a visually \"optimal\" filter. The filter can be adapted to the visual preferences of the individual reader, and serves as a useful teaching tool on the effects of filtering.\r"

Few individuals would disagree that either an acceptance test or routine quality control measurements are necessary, yet agreement on the contents and frequencies of these tests is lacking. This paper discusses the performance parameters of scintillation cameras that are usually measured for planar imaging and also for SPECT with rotating cameras.\r"

For 42 d, rats were fed diets containing less than 1 ppm Cu with 35 or 250 ppm Fe or 5 ppm Cu with 35 or 250 ppm Fe. Electrophoresis of erythrocyte membrane proteins indicated a significant increase in the amount of a 170,000-dalton protein in rats fed copper-deficient diets. High dietary iron reduced the amount of the 170,000-dalton protein in erythrocyte membranes from rats in both the copper-deficient and copper-adequate groups. However, feeding high dietary iron to copper-deficient rats did not reduce the amount of the protein to the level found in rats fed the copper-adequate diet containing 35 ppm Fe. Triton X-100 extraction of erythrocyte membranes demonstrated that the 170,000-dalton protein was associated with the membrane cytoskeleton. Thus, copper deficiency possibly alters the cell's mechanical properties and consequently decreases erythrocyte survivability by modifying the membrane cytoskeleton.\r"

  ".W": "The Gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenzae has been shown to cause a deterioration of the guinea pig pulmonary beta-adrenergic receptor system. In the present study we investigated further the mechanisms behind this effect. To this extent we evaluated the involvement of pulmonary macrophages (PM). Treatment of guinea pigs with killed H. influenzae bacteria resulted in the accumulation of a factor in the serum which could specifically stimulate PM. Thus stimulated, PM from nontreated animals caused a decrease of tracheal beta-adrenergic receptor function in vitro. This effect was evident by a decrease of the maximal response of the dose-response curves to isoprenaline, whereas the EC50 values did not change. Catalase and thiourea abolished the PM-induced effects, whereas superoxide dismutase did not, indicating that oxygen-centered radicals, in particular the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, may be responsible for the observed effects. In addition, dexamethasone also inhibited the decrease of tracheal beta-adrenergic receptor function. When activated PM, taken from animals that had been pretreated with killed H. influenzae bacteria 4 days beforehand, were stimulated with serum from a H. influenzae-treated animal, a potentiation of tracheal beta-adrenergic receptor function was observed.\r"

Nonlymphoidal tissues do not normally express high endothelial venules; however, in inflammatory rheumatic diseases associated with prominent lymphocyte accumulation (e.g., rheumatoid synovium), high endothelial venule-like structures are found and may facilitate local lymphocyte traffic. In mouse and man there are lymphocyte surface membrane homing receptors which determine lymphocyte binding to acceptor sites on lymph node high endothelial venules. The migration of lymphocytes from the circulation into inflamed nonlymphoidal tissues may be controlled by similar homing receptor mediated mechanisms.\r"
