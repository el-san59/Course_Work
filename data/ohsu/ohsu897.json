  ".W": "An economic evaluation is designed to prioritize expenditure, aid decision making, and inform medical audit. A good economic evaluation is explicit and clearly describes the alternative therapies to be evaluated. The evaluation takes into consideration the cost of each component and measures outcome in economic benefit and physical, social, and psychologic well-being. A variety of approaches can be used to assess quality of life, and a good economic evaluation will use a range of measures. Costs and outcomes of health care interventions typically accrue across time periods, and the analysis must allow for this. Similarly, data must answer the question; how much does it cost to identify one additional unit of benefit? Because all evaluations are imprecise both in cost and outcome, sensitivity analysis is needed to determine the effect that different assumptions have on the results.\r"

In this article the three main types of evaluation are discussed: cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, and cost-benefit analysis. The measurement of direct and indirect costs is described and specific examples are quoted. Full economic analyses are given for the use of naftidrofuryl in the treatment of acute cerebral hemisphere infarction and the use of auranofin in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Economic evaluation is seen to be justified whenever a more expensive treatment is expected to produce greater benefit. Such analyses should consider quality of life and health status, as well as the more easily identifiable outcomes.\r"

This was largely the result of the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors into clinical practice. In this article the implications of escalating drug costs are examined. The impact of revolutionary new drugs is considered, and it is questioned whether even a relatively wealthy country, such as Australia, can afford the high costs of these new agents. The Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is discussed, and modification of this into a two-tier system is proposed. A two-tier system could preserve the present list and the essential elements of the current scheme but would introduce a second list of new drugs for which a premium would be charged. Such a system could recoup costs generated by new drugs and also restrict overprescribing but may limit the prescription of new drugs to less well-off persons. The article concludes by considering the total health care budget, taking into account the relative cost-benefit expenditures of hospital care and drug therapy.\r"

  ".W": "To assess muscle function after a period of negative energy balance, 32 obese women were placed on a 544-kcal/d, high-protein diet for 4 wk. Weight loss was associated with a decrease in the waist-to-hip-circumference ratio (WHR) and significantly higher emptying of abdominal than gluteal fat cells. The low-calorie regimen was associated with a significant increase in isokinetic muscle endurance, a decrease in glycogen concentration, and an increase in glycogen synthase (GS) activity and its fractional velocity (FV). The GS activity and its FV were negatively correlated with the WHR before treatment whereas their subsequent increase was correlated with the decrease in WHR. Dietary treatment produced a decrease in the isokinetic muscle strength, which was correlated with the reduction in lean body mass. The improvement in dynamic endurance observed after energy restriction parallels not only the increase in GS activity in muscle but also the decrease in glycogen stores and glucose oxidation, and most probably depends on the increased utilization of fatty acids.\r"

Fasting serum was obtained from omnivorous control subjects (Omni, n = 100), semivegetarians (Semiveg, n = 16), and vegetarians (Veg, n = 25). PLs, CEs, FFAs, and triglyceride (TG) fatty acids were quantitated by thin-layer and gas chromatography. Serum 20:4n-6 was lower in the PL fraction in both Veg (p less than 0.01) and Semiveg groups (p less than 0.05) than in the Omni group and lower in the CE fraction in the Veg group (p less than 0.05). Serum 18:2n-6 did not differ between groups for any serum lipid fraction. 18:3n-3 was elevated in PLs and CEs of both Veg (p less than 0.05 and 0.01) and Semiveg groups (p less than 0.05 and 0.01) compared with the Omni group but did not result in differences in 20:5n-3 in PLs or CEs between diet groups. The lower concentration of 20:4n-6 in serum PLs and CEs of the Veg group indicates that dietary arachidonic acid enriches its circulating pool in humans; however, 20:5n-3 is not similarly responsive to dietary restriction.\r"

No significant changes were seen in serum prealbumin, total protein, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and 5'-nucleotidase during TPN infusion. Major complications included catheter sepsis, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, and premature death in six animals. Thus, metabolic complications of prolonged TPN support may be investigated in a freely mobile nonhuman primate.\r"

The authors evaluated the clinical applications of both methods. Serum samples (N = 180) were divided into the following five clinical groups: Group 1: elevated luteinizing hormone (LH), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which share alpha subunits with hCG; Group 2: pregnancy; Group 3: trophoblastic tumors; Group 4: malignancy; and Group 5: positive rheumatoid factor or anti-nuclear antibody (ANA). The values of beta hCG versus IhCG for Group 1 showed statistical significance but no clinical significance, indicating negligible cross-reactivity in the alpha subunit group. beta hCG values, although exceeding the IhCG values, correlated well (r = 0.97) in intrauterine pregnancies; however, these values were not believed to be clinically significant. There is negligible interference by alpha subunits, elevated rheumatoid factor, ANA, or malignancy in the determination of IhCG versus beta hCG. The authors conclude that either the IhCG or beta hCG assays may be used in clinical conditions in which a potential exists for interference of alpha subunits, autoantibodies, or heterophile antibodies or in malignancy.\r"

These patients had normal or only slightly decreased plasma clotting factor levels. The activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged in four of the patients. The abnormal feature common to all patients was a qualitative loss of high molecular weight multimers of vWF by crossed immunoelectrophoresis (vWF:CIE). Plasma vWF antigen concentration (vWF:Ag) and ristocetin cofactor activity (vWF:RCo) also were decreased and bleeding time prolonged in three patients. Epistaxis was present in two. No family history of increased bleeding tendency was present in any patient. Coagulation parameters and vWF:CIE were normal in two first-degree relatives without this hemoglobinopathy. vWF abnormalities and clinical manifestations were greatest in those patients with the most severe anemia and hepatosplenomegaly. These six patients appear to have an acquired abnormality of vWF, although they lack the clinical characteristics of acquired von Willebrand disease. While the etiology of this abnormality is unclear, the authors speculate that proteolysis of vWF secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis or loss through high cardiac output shear stress in these anemic patients may be involved.\r"

However, IF lacks sensitivity, requires special equipment and training, and is difficult to interpret. The authors have developed an indirect avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase (IP) technique to detect RR in fixed and frozen tissue sections. The technique was evaluated on fixed cutaneous specimens from patients dying of RMSF and compared to specimens from control patients dying of an acute febrile illness with skin manifestations and vasculitis. IP correctly identified RR in 9 of 12 cases with probable identification in 2 additional cases. Of 11 controls, 10 were negative and one was uninterpretable. RR was easily visualized within cytoplasm and nuclei of endothelial cells in association with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and less frequently with vasculitis or non-inflamed vasculature. IP is rapid, amplifies small quantities of antigen, gives excellent histologic detail as compared with IF, and is easily adapted for use in hospitals with immunoperoxidase capabilities.\r"

No falsely positive test results were obtained; 58 nontuberculous mycobacteria other than M. avium complex were negative by Gen-Probe. In a second phase of testing, Gen-Probe tests were performed using concentrates from 101 patient Bactec 12B cultures. Positive results by Gen-Probe tests were correlated with the growth index (GI) reading on the day of processing as well as the accumulated GI readings. For those 51 with high (greater than or equal to 999) final GIs, 40/40 (100%) M. tuberculosis complex isolates and 9/11 M. avium complex isolates were positive by Gen-Probe, and six other mycobacteria were negative. Of the 25 with moderate final readings (400 less than or equal to GI less than 999), 12/17 M. tuberculosis complex isolates and 1/1 M. avium complex isolates were correctly identified by Gen-Probe; seven other mycobacteria were negative. Of 25 with low readings (GI less than 400), 8/24 M. tuberculosis isolates were correctly identified by Gen-Probe, and no falsely positive test results were obtained with the other probes. All true negative tests on seven other mycobacteria (not M. tuberculosis complex or M. avium complex) had less than 2% hybridization. Of the 24 falsely negative tests on M. tuberculosis complex isolates or M. avium complex isolates, 22 had greater than 2% hybridization with their respective probes. Thus, percent hybridization greater than 2% may be a useful indicator of the need for retesting.\r"

  ".W": "To determine serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels, we used radioimmunoassay, and compared the results obtained with other tests in 231 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection to evaluate its clinical implications. All of these patients were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive. Among them, 38 patients had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 18 had chronic persistent hepatitis, 70 had chronic lobular or active hepatitis (grouped as CAH), 31 had active cirrhosis (AC), 25 had inactive cirrhosis, 20 had decompensated cirrhosis, and 29 were \"healthy\" HBsAg carriers. Twenty-seven patients with acute hepatitis, 12 with cancer metastasis to the liver, and 81 normal adults served as disease or normal controls. The results showed that serum TBG level increased significantly in patients with CAH, AC, or HCC. Serum TBG did not correlate with albumin or bilirubin level, but correlated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) positively in patients with CAH (p less than 0.001) and negatively in patients with HCC (p less than 0.01) (slope difference p less than 0.05). Serial determination of serum TBG and ALT also showed parallel changes in 15 patients with CAH, but not in nine patients with HCC. In contrast, the fall and rise of serum TBG levels in patients with HCC coincided with tumor resection and recurrence. The data suggest that serum TBG elevation in patients with hepatitis activity is the result of hepatocellular damage, whereas that in patients with HCC is due to increased synthesis. Whether serum TBG elevation without concomitant rise of ALT could be used as a marker of HCC awaits further study.\r"

We measured the dental pulp profile area (PRATIO [= pulp area/tooth area]) and serum phosphorus (Pi) values in uniformly treated XLH patients (six males, 81 teeth, 1,457 Pi values; 11 females, 129 teeth, 1,439 Pi values). Serum Pi values, reflecting the metabolic environment of tooth development, were obtained by repeated measurement between 1 mo and 26 years of age during treatment. PRATIO values calculated from standardized Rinn radiographs were used as outcome measurements of tooth development in XLH patients and in age-matched controls (12 males, 100 teeth; 27 females, 275 teeth). Age-dependent serum Pi values were not different in the treated XLH males and females. In teeth forming primary dentin there was no gene dosage effect on PRATIO values apparent in subjects below 15 years of age. However, in teeth forming secondary dentin a gene dosage was found in the subjects aged 15 to 25 years: XLH male teeth (n = 65) mean +/- SD = 0.163 +/- 0.046; XLH female teeth (n = 75) mean +/- SD = 0.137 +/- 0.039; control teeth (n = 209) mean +/- SD = 0.116 +/- 0.023; (higher PRATIO values mean less development or mineralization of secondary dentin); differences in these PRATIO values (males vs. female and XLH vs. control) were significant by mixed-model analysis of variance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA, supplied as Activase) with heparin alone or rt-PA plus heparin in the treatment of venographically documented proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the leg. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients underwent 65 randomizations to rt-PA alone (n = 36), rt-PA plus heparin (n = 17), or heparin alone (n = 12) in a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, with efficacy assessed by a radiology panel unaware of treatment assignment. Patients randomly assigned to rt-PA received 0.05 mg/kg/hour for 24 hours via a peripheral vein, with a maximum dose of 150 mg. All patients then received heparin and warfarin for the remainder of the hospitalization. Follow-up venography was performed 24 to 36 hours after initiation of therapy. RESULTS: Complete or more than 50% lysis occurred in 10 (28%) patients treated with rt-PA, five (29%) patients with rt-PA plus heparin, and no patient treated with heparin. No lysis occurred in 16 (44%) patients treated with rt-PA plus heparin, and 10 (83%) patients who received heparin alone (p = 0.04). There was one major complication, a nonfatal intracranial hemorrhage in a patient who received rt-PA alone. At 7 to 10 days after initiation of treatment, the level of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase nearly doubled among all patients, including those assigned to receive heparin alone. CONCLUSION: (1) rt-PA and rt-PA plus heparin cause more clot lysis than heparin alone; (2) the addition of heparin to rt-PA does not improve the lysis rate; (3) DVT treated with heparin is commonly associated with a rise in the transaminase level; (4) heparin does not increase the risk of bleeding from rt-PA therapy; and (5) alternative dosing regimens and modes of administration of rt-PA should be investigated to improve further its efficacy and safety in the treatment of acute DVT.\r"

Blood drawn from an indwelling catheter every 10 minutes for 5 hours was assayed for follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, and prolactin concentrations. All estradiol levels were less than 20 pg/ml and prolactin values were normal. Mean gonadotropin concentrations, pulse frequency, and pulse amplitude were no different in women aged 27 to 49 years as compared with subjects 52 to 64 years old. When grouped according to gynecologic age (years since puberty) or years after oophorectomy, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone mean concentrations, mean pulse frequency, and mean pulse amplitude were comparable to those grouped according to chronologic age. On the basis of our findings, lack of response from postmenopausal ovaries to endogenous gonadotropin stimulation is a result of primary age-related change in the ovary, not in the hypothalamus.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the possibility that major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens and interferon gamma, a product of activated T lymphocytes, play a role in human autoimmune oophoritis. MHC class II molecules initiate immune responses by presenting antigens to T-helper lymphocytes; interferon gamma can induce class II antigen expression at ectopic sites and has been implicated in the cause of various autoimmune disorders. We studied the expression of class II MHC antigens in ovaries from normal women of reproductive-age and from women with premature autoimmune ovarian failure. Immunoperoxidase technique applied to tissue sections of nine normal human ovaries revealed class II MHC antigen expression only on occasional cells of macrophage morphology; granulosa cells were negative regardless of stage of follicular maturation. In contrast, extensive and intense class II antigen expression was observed in granulosa cells in ovarian biopsy sections from four patients with premature autoimmune ovarian failure. Immunofluorescence and radioimmunoassay techniques used to detect and quantitate MHC antigens revealed that class II antigen expression could be induced and class I MHC antigen expression was enhanced in granulosa cell cultures after the addition of interferon gamma. These data provide evidence that autoimmune oophoritis is associated with ectopic expression of MHC class II antigens by ovarian granulosa cells, and that this phenomenon can be induced by the immunologic cytokine interferon gamma.\r"

Noninvasive assessments of disease response in patients with myomas have shown that bone changes might be prevented and other side effects of long-term therapy can be alleviated by adding back small amounts of estrogen or progestin. No comparable data are available for patients with endometriosis because the need for repeated laparoscopy has made long-term studies impractical. Nevertheless, a short-term study of patients with endometriosis showed that adding small amounts of progestin during treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist may help prevent bone changes.\r"

To reexamine this issue, rats were fed unrestricted amounts of a diet in which 36% of the energy was provided by either ethanol or isocaloric amounts of carbohydrate. In half the animals, 7% of fat consisted of arachidonic acid. Despite earlier reports to the contrary, arachidonic acid had no effect on weight gain and did not attenuate the ethanol-induced fatty liver. Arachidonate supplementation tended to increase hepatic total lipids and triacylglycerols, and to potentiate the ethanol-induced elevation of cholesterol esters. Our present results are consistent with those previously reported using pair-feeding techniques in which dietary intakes are somewhat limited. Thus, regardless of the feeding technique employed, relative arachidonic deficiency cannot be involved to explain the lipid accumulation observed after chronic ethanol consumption.\r"

Elevated 6-keto-prostaglandin-F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) suggests prostacyclin is the mediator. To test this hypothesis, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen (n = 14), or placebo (n = 13) was administered to patients electively scheduled for aortic reconstruction. The hemodynamic measurements and plasma concentrations of prostanoids between groups were compared immediately before (0), and 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min following mesenteric traction. Following mesenteric traction significant differences (P less than 0.05) were observed between the ibuprofen pretreatment and placebo group over time in SVR, MAP, HR, CI, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane B2 (TXB2). Significant differences between groups at individual times were found in SVR, HR, CI, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and TXB2. In the placebo group flushing was accompanied by reduced SVR and MAP and increased HR and CI. The greatest effect was seen at 10 min and resolved over 30 min. Plasma concentration of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha increased from 159 +/- 103 (mean +/- SEM) pg/ml to a peak value of 3,765 +/- 803 at 10 min. A late increase in TXB2 occurred with a peak value of 1,970 +/- 891 (mean +/- SEM) pg/ml at 30 min. In the ibuprofen pretreated group no significant changes occurred in hemodynamic measurements or concentrations of prostanoids. The inhibition of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and its associated hemodynamic changes in the treatment group, but not in the placebo group, confirms the hypothesis that prostacyclin is the mediator of the mesenteric traction response in abdominal aortic surgery.\r"

Their adequacy and cost were evaluated by reviewing the records of 92 consecutive trauma patients. Forty-seven of 74 patients (63.5%) had adequate PCS in that all seven cervical vertebrae were visualized. In 27 patients (36.5), all seven cervical vertebrae were not adequately visualized. Inadequate studies were most likely to occur in patients with abnormal vital signs on admission (56%) (P less than .01) and in those subsequently requiring general anesthesia (34.5%). Fifteen patients were intubated without difficulty by maintaining neck immobilization because of uncertainty regarding cervical-spine injuries. The annual cost of inadequate cervical-spine studies was estimated to be $31,000.00. Although the four cervical-spine injuries were diagnosed by the portable technique, routine PCS were frequently inadequate in visualizing all seven cervical vertebrae. Major decisions concerning intubation and surgery frequently had to be made before adequate radiographic evaluation could be completed. It is suggested that time and money are lost by routinely doing a single lateral portable cervical radiograph. It is more appropriate to obtain complete radiographic studies after life-threatening injuries are addressed while patients are treated using the standard techniques of neck immobilization.\r"

Although the patients were treated preoperatively with multidrug regimens in an effort to reduce the mycobacterial burden, 20 of 29 were still sputum-culture-positive at the time of surgery. The bulk of the disease was manifest in one lung, but lesser amounts of contralateral disease were demonstrated in 27 of 29. Pneumonectomy was done in 15 patients; lobectomy or lobectomy plus was done in 14. Although physiologic studies before surgery indicated significant respiratory impairment in many of the patients, there were no operative deaths. There were two unrelated deaths in this series. Of the 27 survivors, 25 have remained sputum-culture-negative for a mean duration of 36 months.

Half were isolated from patients with AIDS and the other half from patients without AIDS but with pulmonary disease. The MICs and MBCs were also determined in 7H12 broth for M. tuberculosis strains. The MIC results obtained with M. tuberculosis strains, and the serum peak levels in humans, were used as standards for interpretation of the MICs and MBCs of the rifamycins for M. avium. The bactericidal activity of all rifamycins for M. avium was substantially lower than for M. tuberculosis. The majority of M. avium strains was within the \"susceptible\" category, e.g., comparable to susceptible M. tuberculosis strains, when tested with CGP-7040 and RPT, and all of them were \"moderately susceptible\" when tested with P-DEA. On the basis of in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity, it seems that three agents, RPT, P-DEA, and CGP-7040 have more potential than do RMP and RBT against M. avium disease.\r"

GBS were radiolabeled with 111In and infused intravenously for 15 min (10(8) organisms/kg/min) into infant piglets ranging in age from 5 to 14 days. Lung specimens were excised at termination of the GBS infusion or 45 min thereafter, and both the relative deposition and viability of the bacteria were determined. The percentage of infused GBS recovered in lung tissue did not differ between the two time points (26 +/- 7% versus 29 +/- 8%), but the relative viability at termination of the infusion, 50 +/- 11%, was reduced to 19 +/- 4% within 45 min. Treatment with an oxygen radical scavenger, dimethylthiourea (DMTU), failed to influence the pulmonary deposition of GBS but significantly increased viability of the organism from 21.4 +/- 2.6 to 33.3 +/- 5.3%. As expected, GBS infusion was accompanied by pulmonary hypertension and arterial hypoxemia; DMTU attenuated these responses by 52 and 78%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These contractions were not inhibited by nifedipine (1 microM), the intracellular Ca2+ blocker TMB-8 (50 microM), a 0 Ca2+ and EGTA (2 mM) bath, or endothelial denudation. They were reduced by amiloride (500 microM), an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange, and 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7); (50 microM), an inhibitor of protein kinase C. PMA caused concentration-dependent (5 to 500 nM) potentiation of KCl, serotonin, and A23187 contractions of isolated pulmonary arteries. The effect of PMA on norepinephrine contraction was dependent on both concentration and time. Whereas PMA potentiated norepinephrine contraction after 5 min, it inhibited the response after 60 min. PMA and mezerein also caused concentration-dependent (0.5 to 500 nM) vasoconstriction in isolated lungs. The PMA vasoconstriction was unaltered by meclofenamate (1.6 microM) but was attenuated by nifedipine (1 microM). Low concentrations of PMA (5 nM) and 1,2-DOG (50 microM) potentiated both hypoxic and KCl vasoconstriction in isolated lungs. In contrast, the hypoxic and KCl responses were blunted by H-7 (30 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both age groups exhibited a fall in minute ventilation (VE) with loads of two to five times baseline respiratory elastance. There was no statistical difference in the ventilatory response between age groups. The response patterns of both groups were characterized by a fall in both tidal volume (VT) and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) associated with a prolongation of TI and TI/Ttot. All subjects demonstrated a significant load compensatory response both in terms of neural drive (diaphragmatic EMG output) and force output (inspiratory work production). Arterial CO2 increased significantly during loading in the older subjects in linear correlation with the decline in VE, but the newborns did not exhibit a statistically significant alteration in PaCO2 throughout the range of elastic loads. These data indicate that normal newborns are capable of responding to an external elastic load and that the newborn response is comparable to that of more mature subjects.\r"

  ".W": "We report our initial experience with a technique with which the chemoresponsiveness of the respiratory controller can be characterized in terms of an inspiratory on-switch threshold to CO2. After suppression of phasic respiratory muscle activity by mechanical ventilation, a CO2 recruitment threshold (PCO2RT) was defined as the lowest alveolar CO2 tension at which CO2 supplementation to inspired gas caused a reappearance of inspiratory efforts. Because PCO2RT can be determined in the absence of a mechanical load on the ventilatory pump, respiratory system mechanics and inspiratory muscle function should not influence the measurement itself. Thus, this technique may be helpful to study ventilatory requirements and load responses in critically ill patients with respiratory failure. We have shown that inspiratory muscle recruitment can be equally well-inferred from changes in the airway pressure and flow tracings during mechanical ventilation, from the pattern of chest wall displacement, and from the integrated diaphragm electromyogram. Within a subject, PCO2RT is a reproducible measurement that is not influenced by ventilator settings and end-expiratory lung volume, provided that phasic respiratory muscle has been suppressed prior to CO2 supplementation. Details of the methodology, the likely determinants of PCO2RT, and the clinical utility of this technique are discussed.\r"

G proteins modulate not only cAMP formation, but also intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, arachidonic acid release, and, very importantly, membrane potential. The mechanism by which G proteins are activated provides for amplification, reversal of action, and continued monitoring of incoming signals. Not all G proteins are known and some are known but their functions are still unknown. More G proteins and more effector functions affected by them will surely be found. We discuss these features of signal transduction by G proteins.\r"

  ".U": "90178864\r", 
  ".W": "Physiologic responses mediated by calcium-mobilizing receptors are initiated by the phospholipase C-catalyzed generation from phosphatidyl inositol (4,5)-bisphosphate of two intracellular second messengers: inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, which induces the release of calcium from intracellular stores, and diacylglycerol, which stimulates protein kinase C activity. Recent studies illustrating guanine nucleotide dependence for hormonal stimulation of membrane phospholipase C suggest involvement of a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (G protein) in phosphoinositide/Ca2+ signaling. Kinetic analysis indicates that the receptor-stimulated phospholipase C catalytic cycle expresses properties similar to those described in detail for receptor and G protein-regulated adenylate cyclase. However, the identity of the phospholipase C-associated G protein remains to be established, and available data suggest that different G proteins (at least two) may be involved in a tissue- and/or receptor-specific manner. The identity of the phospholipase C involved in the action of calcium-mobilizing hormones also has not been established. Multiple forms of membrane-associated and cytosolic phospholipase C enzymes have been described during the last few years, which increases the apparent complexity of the system. The identification and purification of the G protein(s) and the phospholipase C enzyme(s) of this important signaling system followed by unambiguous reconstitution of their physiologic activities represent major challenges in this field for the coming years.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a 62-dose, four-drug, 6-month, and directly observed regimen for treatment of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. DESIGN: An open, nonblinded clinical trial, with intended follow-up of patients for 36 months after the completion of therapy. SETTING: A metropolitan tuberculosis clinic in a public health department. PATIENTS: From March 1981 through April 1989, we enrolled 160 patients with suspected or known tuberculosis; 35 of these patients were excluded from the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin were administered daily for 2 weeks; these drugs were then given in higher doses twice weekly for 6 weeks, followed by isoniazid and rifampin twice weekly for 6 weeks, followed by isoniazid and rifampin twice weekly for 18 weeks. A total of 62 doses were administered, and all therapy was directly observed by a nurse or an outreach worker. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 125 evaluable patients, 101 (81%) had pulmonary tuberculosis, 7 (6%) had both pulmonary and extrapulmonary involvement, and 17 (13%) had extrapulmonary disease only. Seventy-one (57%) patients had a history of recent alcoholism. There were two relapses (1.6% +/- 2.2%), occurring 6 and 56 months after the completion of therapy. The time at which sputum samples became culture negative in pulmonary patients ranged from 1 to 19 weeks (median, 4.6 weeks); 40% +/- 9.6% of patients were culture-negative after 4 weeks of therapy, 75% +/- 8.5% after 8 weeks, 94% +/- 4.7% after 12 weeks, 97% +/- 3.3% after 16 weeks, and 100% after 20 weeks. Adverse drug reactions included hyperuricemia (greater than 178 mumol/L [3 mg/dL] above normal) secondary to pyrazinamide in 80 patients (64%), twofold or greater elevations of aspartate aminotransferase in 21 patients (17%), 1.5-fold or greater elevations of alkaline phosphatase in 33 patients (27%), cutaneous abnormalities in 8 patients (6%), nausea in five patients (4%), and dizziness in 1 patient (1%). CONCLUSIONS: This 62-dose, largely twice-weekly tuberculosis treatment regimen is efficacious and relatively nontoxic and is especially useful for patients in whom directly observed therapy is indicated.\r"

The nonamyloid forms were found in 13 patients who had evidence of plasmacytic dyscrasia by the immunohistochemical detection of immunoglobulin light chains of kappa or lambda class (with or without staining for a single heavy chain isotype) and by the absence of amyloid P component in tissue sections that did not show the birefringence characteristic of amyloid after Congo Red staining. All but two of the patients presented with proteinuria with or without azotemia. Clinical syndromes involving other organ systems were less common but occasionally severe. Four patients had overt multiple myeloma. Three others had hypercalcemia and mild bone marrow plasmacytosis but no lytic lesions. Analyses of immunoglobulin synthesis in bone marrow cells from seven patients showed excess light chains in all and incomplete light chains or heavy chain fragments in six, regardless of whether an intact monoclonal protein or related subunit was in the serum or urine. The fibrillar (amyloidotic) and nonfibrillar forms of monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition occur either in overt multiple myeloma or in the course of less neoplastically aggressive plasmacytic dyscrasias. Bone marrow cells from patients with either type produce immunoglobulin fragments that are related to those deposited in the affected tissues.\r"

In the vehicle group, postoperative reduction in intraocular pressure was significant compared with that of the flurbiprofen group. These effects were not found in the diabetic patients. Inflammatory responses were not suppressed in the flurbiprofen group compared with the control group except for pericorneal injection.\r"

In 10 of 42 patients, punctiform psoriatic foci could be induced at the site of injection of interferon gamma. For this presentation, we selected a female patient with psoriatic arthropathy and type II diabetes mellitus in whom psoriasis was induced at the site of application of interferon gamma, but not after subcutaneous injection of insulin or placebo.

Pathologic evidence of lymph-nodes metastases was found in 32% of the patients. Overall survival at 5 and 10 years from surgery was 91% and 78%, respectively. The cumulative probability of survival tends to decrease with increasing tumor size: the 7-year survival rate was 84% in cases in which lesions measured from 1.6 to 2.0 cm, and 94% in cases in which the lesions were less than 0.5 cm. Tumor site in the treated breast did not affect distant outcome. No difference was found between the patients without node metastases and patients with one node involved, whereas the patients with more than one node showed a lower probability of survival. The survival curves of 352 cases treated inside a randomized trial and that of 880 cases routinely treated appear to be superimposable. Local recurrences and new primary ipsilateral tumors were, respectively, 35 (2.8%) and 19 (1.6%); 56 women with local recurrences or second tumors underwent second surgery (total mastectomy, 43; wide resection, 11). Five of them died from distant spread of breast cancer, while 49 are alive and well. In the contralateral breasts 45 carcinomas were recorded during the follow-up time. The results of the present analysis of a large number of T1 cases reconfirm the safety of integrated radiosurgical conservative treatments.\r"

We performed a cost-minimization analysis on 287 patients who underwent choledochoscopy during operations for biliary tract calculi between 1981 and 1987 to assess the economic impact of choledochoscopy versus noncholedochoscopic alternatives in obtaining a stone-free duct. Common duct exploration was positive for calculi in 75% of patients. Choledochoscopy-detected residual stones after duct exploration in 10% of patients. Residual stones were more frequent after positive (12.5%) than negative (2.7%) duct explorations. retained stones occurred in 4.5% of patients after operation. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values of choledochoscopy were 67%, 100%, and 95%, respectively. Cost-minimization analysis showed that total cost of either selective ($75,250) or routine ($110,450) choledochoscopy significantly exceeded the total cost of obtaining a stone-free duct for patients with retained stones via either extraction through a T-tube tract ($17,545) or by endoscopic papillotomy ($45,675). Because choledochoscopy was not economically competitive with noncholedochoscopic, nonoperative alternatives, reduction of choledochoscopy fees was implemented to economically justify continued use of choledochoscopy. We conclude that choledochoscopy is clinically efficacious in obtaining a stone-free duct, but endorsement of either routine or selective choledochoscopy by cost-minimization analysis requires careful assessment of fee structure to make choledochoscopy competitive economically.\r"

There was negative nitrogen balance and net loss of amino acids from the limb during fasting. An infusion of 0.2 gN.kg-1.[day]-1 of IVN reversed the net catabolic process and resulted in equilibrium of peripheral total amino acid flux and of tyrosine flux without a decrease in 3MH excretion. Net uptake of total amino acids and tyrosine in peripheral tissues was achieved with 0.4 gN.kg-1.[day]-1 and 56 kcal.kg-1.[day]-1. This was associated with a fivefold increase in 3MH excretion (p less than 0.01), indicating that net anabolism occurred with increased protein turnover. Fifty per cent of the amino acids taken up by peripheral tissues during infusions of 0.4 gN.kg-1.[day]-1 was due to the uptake of glutamate (Glu) and 20% was due to the uptake of branched chain amino acids (BCAA). Plasma Glu concentration, [Glu], did not increase with increasing IVN infusion, but BCAA concentrations did. Although the mean plasma [Glu] did not change with IVN infusion, there was an independent effect of plasma [Glu] (p less than 0.0001) and of N input (p less than 0.0001) on Glu flux, indicating that even at high infusion rates the maximal capacity of peripheral tissues to take up Glu had not been reached.\r"

Our aim was to compare serum levels of mucosal (diamine oxidase, alkaline phosphatase) and seromuscular (creatinine phosphokinase, lactic dehydrogenase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transminase) enzymes during intestinal ischemia of varying extent and duration in dogs. Group 1 (n = 6) underwent sham laparotomy. Group 2 (n = 8) had 50% of the small intestine devascularized. Group 3 (n = 8) had the superior mesenteric artery occluded for 2 hours and released. Group 4 (n = 8) had the superior mesenteric artery ligated. Serum samples were obtained before and 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after operation, and histologic specimens were examined at 4 hours. Creatinine phosphokinase levels became elevated within 4 hours of ischemic injury in group 2 (223 +/- 197 vs. 68 +/- 26, p less than 0.05) and group 4 (212 +/- 136 vs. 76 +/- 29, p less than 0.05). Significant elevation of serum enzymes levels, except diamine oxidase, occurred in groups 2, 3, and 4 at 24 hours, including those with normal histology after temporary superior mesenteric artery occlusion. Thus seromuscular enzymes, particularly creatinine phosphokinase, were more likely to be elevated during intestinal ischemia. Enzyme levels were not influenced by the extent and reversibility of the ischemic injury.\r"

  ".W": "Recent efforts to improve survival in patients with esophageal carcinoma have combined both systemic and local therapy. From October 1985 to October 1987, 43 patients with local-regional esophageal cancer (adenocarcinoma in 21, squamous cell in 22) were treated with cisplatin, vinblastine, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy concurrent with 4,500 cGy radiation therapy for 21 days before transhiatal esophagectomy 3 weeks later. Two patients died of chemotherapy/radiation therapy toxicity. Forty-one completed preoperative chemotherapy/radiation therapy. At operation, 2 patients had incurable metastatic disease; 39 underwent transhiatal esophagectomy. Eleven patients had no residual tumor in the resected specimen for a 27% (11 of 41) pathological complete response rate. Preoperative chemotherapy/radiation therapy resulted in no increased perioperative morbidity as compared with our historical controls. One patient died postoperatively of an unrecognized brain metastasis (2% operative morbidity). At a median follow-up of 27 months, 20 patients (47%) are alive and clinically disease-free and 21 have died, 19 from progression of their carcinoma. The median survival time for all 43 patients is 29 months (Kaplan-Meier estimate), and cumulative survival is 72% at 12 months, 60% at 24 months, and 46% at 36 months. All 11 patients with a complete response are alive at a median follow-up of 36 months, and all are disease-free. The 2-year survival of 60% of this group as compared with 32% in our earlier patients treated with transhiatal esophagectomy alone suggests that intensive combined modality therapy improves survival in these patients. A randomized prospective trial is now in progress.\r"

  ".W": "Unlike many other vasodilators, prostaglandin E1 may reduce pulmonary vascular resistance without changing intrapulmonary shunt in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome. Whether the same is true for surgical patients with cardiogenic pulmonary hypertension but normal gas exchange remains unclear. Data from the intraoperative records of 8 patients with pulmonary hypertension and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance were used for the study. Hemodynamic variables had been monitored through radial arterial cannulas and pulmonary arterial catheters. Arterial and mixed venous oxygen tension, carbon dioxide tension, oxygen saturation, and hemoglobin level, as well as cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, had been determined in each patient before prostaglandin E1 infusion was started and again when the desired pulmonary vascular response had been achieved. Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances and intrapulmonary shunt were calculated from standard formulas. Infusion rates of prostaglandin E1 ranged from 7 to 135 ng/kg/min. Prostaglandin E1 reduced mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure but did not change intrapulmonary shunt. Heart rate and mean arterial and right atrial pressures were not changed, whereas systemic vascular resistance decreased and cardiac output increased. The present study shows that prostaglandin E1 reduces pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance without dramatic changes in intrapulmonary shunt in patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to cardiac disease.\r"

  ".U": "90179349\r", 
  ".W": "Although selective screening for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) by abdominal palpation aimed at detecting AAAs has engendered considerable support, no population-based data pertaining to the positive predictive value (PPV) of the clinical assessment of AAAs in routine clinical practice are available. Therefore, we used the unique resources of the Rochester (Minn) Epidemiology Project and the Mayo Clinic computerized abdominal ultrasonography database to identify all residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota,who underwent ultrasound examination for a clinically suspected AAA between November 1, 1985, and October 31, 1987. Of 116 residents who were suspected of having an AAA on abdominal palpation and were referred for an ultrasound examination for confirmation, 17 patients had a 3.5-cm or greater AAA by ultrasound examination (PPV = 14.7%). The probability of AAA by ultrasound examination (PPV = 14.7%). The probability of AAA documentation by ultrasound examination given clinical suspicion of an AAA was associated with higher body mass index, older age,and presence of other macrovascular disease. In 17 patients aged 70 years or younger, without other macrovascular disease and with body mass index of 24 or less, only 1 had an AAA of 3.5 cm or greater (PPV = 6%), while 10 of 20 patients aged 70 years or older, with macrovascular disease,and with body mass index greater than 24 had an AAA of 3.5 cm or greater (PPV = 50%). These population-based data that highlight the poor PPV of the clinical assessment for AAAs indicate that abdominal palpation aimed at detecting AAAs as part of a periodic health examination may lead to a much higher rate of false-positive results than indicated by previous referral-based data. Further research is needed to identify patient subgroups in whom abdominal palpation for detection of AAAs will be cost-effective with respect to reduction in AAA mortality.\r"

The condition occurred predominantly in elderly women and was characterized by severe glenohumeral joint degeneration and dissolution of the fibrous rotator cuff. Synovial fluids contained few leukocytes, but were often blood tinged. Basic calcium phosphate crystal aggregates and particulate collagens were noted in nearly all fluids, and collagenase activity was detectable in some, but not all, fluids. The knee joints were involved with a similar process in about half of our patients. In contrast to primary osteoarthritis, lateral tibiofemoral compartment involvement was common. Factors that may predispose to this syndrome included deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals, direct trauma or chronic joint overuse, chronic renal failure, and denervation.\r"

However, patients with left-sided temporal lobe epilepsy scored significantly higher than other groups on self-ratings for depression. This could not be accounted for by factors such as duration of epilepsy, employment status, education, age at seizure onset, or medication status. The left temporal lobe epilepsy group had a nonsignificantly larger number of males and left-handed subjects. The possible interactions between gender, handedness, seizure focus, and vulnerability to depression are described.\r"

These patients had none of the usual causes of excessive daytime somnolence but during sleep exhibited stereotypic body movements, tachycardia, respiratory disturbances, somniloquy, and transient arousals in a repetitive fashion. These episodes induced fragmentation of sleep. The polysomnograms revealed an increase in wakefulness and stage I decreased rapid eye movement during sleep in addition to the episodes of abnormal body movements. No epileptiform features were present either in the electroencephalogram or in the nocturnal polysomnogram. Four of the seven patients were treated with anticonvulsants, with both subjective and objective improvement on subsequent follow-up polysomnograms. Because of the pronounced functional deficits associated with the sleep disorder in these patients, it is of great importance to recognize the disorder and treat it appropriately.\r"

Cellular outgrowth from retinal explants occurred after 7 days as single cells from peripapillary explants or as cell sheets and tubular outgrowths from peripheral retinal explants. Single cell outgrowths were shown immunohistochemically to be endothelial cells or macrophages; sheetlike and tubular outgrowths also constituted cords of endothelial cells with stromal macrophages, but in addition glial cells were closely associated with the endothelial cells. Cellular outgrowths were preceded by extensive macrophage activation within the ischemic retinal explant, suggesting that macrophage-derived angiogenic factors may be important in inducing retinal endothelial cell proliferation. In addition, glial cell-derived factors may have a role in the development of vessellike tubular structures from endothelial cell outgrowths.\r"

Next, a preliminary series of six eyes suggested that using disks that contained 5-fluorouridine extended the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of filtration surgery. This finding was confirmed in eight additional eyes of four animals in which one eye received a disk with 5-fluorouridine and the other received a disk without the drug. The duration of success of the operation was significantly longer in the eyes that received polyanhydride with 5-fluorouridine (mean +/- SD, 26.0 +/- 9.2 days) than in the controls (8.5 +/- 4.0 days). The histologic findings of the experimental eyes correlated with their prolonged clinical success.\r"

  ".W": "A regional wall motion index has been derived from two-dimensional echocardiograms by use of a 16-segment model that was subdivided into anterior (nine segments) and infero-postero-lateral (seven segments) regions. This new method is compared with the use of a previously described global wall motion index for the analysis of serial echocardiograms after reperfusion in 23 patients who had acute myocardial infarction. Mean global index improved from 1.84 +/- 0.46 to 1.56 +/- 0.37 at 24 hours (p less than 0.01) and to 1.50 +/- 0.29 after 3 days to 7 days (p less than 0.02), whereas mean regional index for infarct regions improved from 2.28 +/- 0.73 to 1.82 +/- 0.58 at 24 hours (p less than 0.01) and to 1.70 +/- 0.42 after 3 to 7 days (p less than 0.01), with no significant change in the noninfarct index (1.34 +/- 0.32 initially and 1.28 +/- 0.36 after 3 to 7 days). Although both global and regional indexes effectively demonstrate early recovery of left ventricular function, (within 24 hours in many patients), the regional index for infarct regions is higher than the global index and effectively distinguishes between infarct and noninfarct segments. An overlap index in which an additional apical segment is included in the anterior region (10 segments) for anterior infarctions and in the infero-postero-lateral region (eight segments) for inferior infarctions results in a greater differentiation between infarct and noninfarct regions, with the mean initial noninfarct overlap index (1.17 +/- 0.33) significantly less than the nonoverlap index.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The meal increased heart rate, cardiac output, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and minute ventilation at rest and during exercise. The effects of food were additive to those induced by the exercise. Food had no effect on limb blood flow and lowered total systemic vascular resistance suggesting that there were no compensatory changes in regional blood flow to help redirect blood to the gut. An increase in cardiac output, and therefore myocardial work, is the predominant cardiovascular response to eating and this may help explain the postprandial deterioration in symptoms of some patients with cardiovascular disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of human neutrophils to micromolar concentrations of both hydrolyzable and nonhydrolyzable purine nucleotides caused the generation of transient rises in intracellular calcium (Ca2+), Ca2+ fluxes across the membrane, and primed the cells for enhanced production of superoxide (O2-) when subsequently exposed to agonists such as FMLP and arachidonic acid. The neutrophils were most sensitive to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and ATP-gamma-S, which produced Ca2+ transients and enhanced O2- production at concentrations as low as 1 to 5 mumol/L, with a doubling of O2- generation at 25 to 50 mumol/L. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) required approximately 10-fold higher concentrations to cause similar effects. Adenosine did not cause Ca2+ fluxes or a Ca2+ transient and was inhibitory of O2- production. There was a strong correlation between a nucleotide's ability to generate a Ca2+ response and its ability to enhance O2- generation. Nitrogen cavitation and subcellular fractionation of the neutrophils after a brief exposure to ATP, ATP-gamma-S, and AMP-PNP revealed that the enhanced O2- generating capacity was stable and detectable in a cell-free assay system. By combining variously treated cytosolic and membrane fractions, it was found that the enhanced O2- production was attributable to a modification of a component(s) of the cytosol.\r"

DESIGN--Subjects were identified from conventional general practice records and recruited from 1980 to the end of 1985; they were followed up during 1987 and 1988 and compared with drug users identified in the same way but recruited after 1985. SETTING--General practice and community in north west Edinburgh. Follow up conducted throughout the United Kingdom. SUBJECTS--Subjects known to have injected illegal drugs before 1986 (n = 203) and since that time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Mortality from and prevalence of HIV seropositivity and various parameters indicative of abstinence. RESULTS--Of the 203 subjects in the follow up group, 189 (93%) were traced; 16 (8%) had died and the remaining 173 (85%) were interviewed. In all, 146 (72% of the follow up cohort) had been tested for HIV antibodies, 94 (64%) having positive and 52 (36%) negative results; 57 (28%) had not been tested. Of the 65 subjects in the recently recruited group, 51 (79%) had been tested for HIV, 15 (29%) having positive results. A further 21 (43%) were currently negative for HIV antibody but still at risk. Thirty three (19%) of those followed up were confirmed abstinent, although more (about half) showed evidence of diminished drug injecting. Age correlated strongly with abstinence (p less than 0.001). One third of the group currently used cannabis, buprenorphine, dihydrocodeine, or diazepam. When the two groups were analysed together there was a strong association between the date of starting injecting and HIV seropositivity (chi 3 = 23.81, df = 2, p less than 0.001), with a peak around 1980-3. CONCLUSIONS--Although only a fifth of the followed up group were convincingly abstinent, a much larger group showed evidence of prolonged periods of remission. Overall, much use of oral drugs was confirmed and worrying trends towards taking buprenorphine and benzodiazepines were evident. The peak incidence of starting drug use and the comparatively low seroprevalence of HIV in the newer drug users probably explain the anomalous high seroprevalence in Edinburgh drug users during 1980-5. The epidemic of HIV during the first half of the 1980s in the group suggests that the virus was probably being transmitted because of a pattern of behaviour. Changing patterns of HIV transmission suggest a need to concentrate on heterosexual transmission as the main problem in the future.\r"

The system was introduced in 1984 for use in gastroenterology, but it can be employed in a wide range of medical and surgical settings. This series was concerned with predicting postoperative respiratory complications in a group of elderly surgical patients. The system combines elements from Baye's theorem and logistic regression, though no mathematical knowledge is required to apply it in clinical practice. The method by which results are presented is easy to understand, yet at the same time more complex ideas such as conflict of evidence and doubt may be embraced if the clinician so desires.\r"

  ".W": "In medical research data are often collected serially on subjects. The statistical analysis of such data is often inadequate in two ways: it may fail to settle clinically relevant questions and it may be statistically invalid. A commonly used method which compares groups at a series of time points, possibly with t tests, is flawed on both counts. There may, however, be a remedy, which takes the form of a two stage method that uses summary measures. In the first stage a suitable summary of the response in an individual, such as a rate of change or an area under a curve, is identified and calculated for each subject. In the second stage these summary measures are analysed by simple statistical techniques as though they were raw data. The method is statistically valid and likely to be more relevant to the study questions. If this method is borne in mind when the experiment is being planned it should promote studies with enough subjects and sufficient observations at critical times to enable useful conclusions to be drawn. Use of summary measures to analyse serial measurements, though not new, is potentially a useful and simple tool in medical research.\r"

It comprises six specialist nurses, a general practitioner trained medical officer, and a receptionist and is funded from regional and district sources and charities. A nurse is available for out of hours and emergency weekend calls, with support from the patient's general practitioner or the attached medical officer. During the first 18 months 249 patients were seen; the mean duration of care was five months. Nearly a third (18/50, 30%) of patients who were terminally ill died at home. The team's activities included practical nursing care, emotional support for carers and patients, and advice and guidance to primary care teams. Problems in providing care in patients' homes included issues relating to confidentiality and 24 hour cover. With the increasing incidence of HIV infection the home support team may be a useful model for care of large numbers of patients with symptomatic HIV disease, especially in large urban areas.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective cohort study (British regional heart study). SETTING--One general practice in each of 24 towns in Britain. SUBJECTS--7735 Men aged 40-59 years when screened in 1978-80 whose geographic zone of birth and zone of examination were classified as south of England, midlands and Wales, north of England, and Scotland. Non-migrants (n = 3144) were born in the town where they were examined; internal migrants (n = 4147) were born in Great Britain but not in the town where they were examined; and international migrants (n = 422) were born outside Great Britain. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and height. RESULTS--Regardless of where they were born, men living in the south of England had lower mean blood pressures than men living in Scotland (142.5/80.1 v 148.1/85.2 mm Hg). The effects of the place of birth and place of examination on adult blood pressure were examined in a multiple regression model. For internal migrants the modelled increase in mean systolic blood pressure across adjacent zones of examination was 2.1 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 2.9); for adjacent zones of birth the corresponding increase was 0.1 mm Hg (-0.7 to 0.7). The place of examination seemed to be a far more important determinant of mean adult blood pressure than the place of birth. Height is an accepted marker of genetic and early life influences. Regional differences in height were therefore analysed to test whether the multiple regression model could correctly distinguish between the influence of place of birth and place of examination. As expected, men born in Scotland were shorter on average than men born in the south of England irrespective of where they lived in Britain (172.6 cm v 175.1 cm for internal migrants). CONCLUSION--Regional variations in blood pressure were strongly influenced by where the men had lived for most of their adult lives rather than by where they were born and brought up. Among middle aged men, factors acting in adult life seemed to be more important determinants of regional differences in blood pressure than those acting early in life such as genetic inheritance, intrauterine environment, and childhood experience.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study over five years of fetuses aborted in the midtrimester because of abnormalities detected by ultrasonography and amniocentesis. Techniques included a full external examination by a clinical geneticist with experience in dysmorphology and other investigations including necropsy. SETTING--Regional genetic centre. PARTICIPANTS--Clinicians working within the North Western region who wished to use the service offered. RESULTS--133 Fetuses were aborted because of abnormalities detected on ultrasonography and 115 because of abnormal findings on amniotic fluid analysis. In a further two cases fetal abnormality was diagnosed by molecular genetic and biochemical techniques. Among the fetuses with abnormal scans the pretermination diagnosis was changed or refined in a way which affected genetic counselling in 53 of 133 cases. Among the 115 fetuses diagnosed as abnormal by amniocentesis the pretermination diagnosis was confirmed in 112 cases and altered in three. CONCLUSION--Fetuses aborted because of abnormalities detected by screening should be examined by suitably experienced clinicians, both for accurate genetic counselling of the families and for quality control of the tests employed.\r"

DESIGN--216 Subjects aged 60-74 whose urinary albumin excretion rate had been determined were followed up 62-83 months later. SETTING--Municipality of Fredericia, Denmark. SUBJECTS--223 People who had been selected as control subjects for diabetics found during a systematic screening for diabetes of all people aged 60-74 living in the municipality of Fredericia, Denmark. Of these subjects, 216 had an extensive clinical and biochemical examination within a few weeks of selection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death. RESULTS--The median urinary albumin excretion rate was 7.52 micrograms/min. Eight of those with a rate below the median died compared with 23 with a rate equal to or greater than the median (p = 0.0078). The median albumin excretion rate in the 31 who died was 15.00 micrograms/min. Cardiovascular disease was the most common cause of death in both groups. A multivariate regression analysis of survival data was performed using the proportional hazards model. Besides albumin excretion rate, male sex, serum creatinine concentration, and hypertension were found to be of prognostic value. CONCLUSIONS--The association between the albumin excretion rate and mortality that has been described in recent years in patients with diabetes mellitus may be present in elderly people in general, even when other known risk factors are taken into account.\r"

(Patients in group 1 had the greatest mean age.) Proviral DNA was not detected in any subject negative for HTLV-I antibody, making prolonged viral incubation in those negative for the antibody unlikely. CONCLUSION--In this sample factors related to place of birth and early residence were more important in transmission of HTLV-I than maternal or age effects. In areas with a low to moderate prevalence policies of preventing mothers who are carriers of the virus from breast feeding would be premature.\r"

  ".U": "90181725\r", 
  ".W": "Since 1958 the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) has attempted to regulate the promotion of prescription medicines through its code of practice. This regulation is described and analysed for the six years 1983-8 using the reports on 302 complaints considered by its code of practice committee and annual reports. The complaints came mainly from doctors (143, 48%) and competing companies (103, 33%). The committee found a total of 379 breaches of the code in 192 (63%) of the complaints. Additional breaches were detected by informational scrutiny of advertisements by the ABPI secretariat. Analysis showed that 270 (71%) of these breaches involved possible breaches of the Medicines Act. The rules that forbid misleading or unsubstantiated information and misleading claims or comparisons were broken most often. The committee found the most frequent offenders to be Organon (32 breaches), Smith Kline and French (23), Glaxo (21), A H Robins (18), Bayer (17), Merck Sharp and Dohme (17), and Lederle (16). Often the promotion of one product led to several breaches. The promotional wars over histamine H2 receptor antagonists accounted for 33 breaches. It is estimated that in 1983-8 about 100 breaches of the code were detected a year. In the 18 years 1972-88 the Medicines Act was breached probably over 1200 times. Health ministers, by not enforcing the regulations controlling promotion, have abrogated their responsibility to the ABPI, but the evidence suggests that the code has failed to deter promotional excesses. The ABPI's wish to secure compliance with the code seems weaker than its wish to pre-empt outside criticism and action: its self regulation seems to be a service to itself rather than to the public. It is suggested that the code of practice committee should become publicly accountable, that the majority of its members should represent the health professions and the public, and that effective sanctions are needed.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty may be safely performed in cardiology centres in the United Kingdom without immediate on site cardiac surgical cover for complications arising at angioplasty. DESIGN--Retrospective review of coronary angioplasties and complications in a hospital without on site cardiac surgical cover. SETTING--All angioplasties were performed in the catheterisation laboratory of the Belfast City Hospital. Revascularisation surgery for complicated coronary angioplasty was performed in the cardiac surgical unit of the Royal Victoria Hospital, 2.4 km away from the catheterisation laboratory. PATIENTS--540 Coronary angioplasties were performed on 512 patients between late 1982 and November 1988. Indications included stable angina, unstable rest angina, and suitable coronary disease at coronary arteriography after myocardial infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--In hospital mortality after complicated coronary angioplasty and delay to surgical revascularisation after acute coronary occlusion at angioplasty. RESULTS--Coronary angioplasty was successful in 444 cases (82%). Acute coronary occlusion occurred in 35 cases (6.5%). Twelve patients required urgent revascularisation surgery and were transferred safely to the surgical unit; none of these patients died. A mean delay of 268 minutes (range 180-390 minutes) occurred before revascularisation compared with 273 minutes (range 108-420 minutes) in the Royal Victoria Hospital, where on site surgical cover was available. The principal cause of delay was the wait for a cardiac operating theatre to become available and not the transfer time between hospitals. Five deaths occurred after coronary angioplasty, a mortality of 0.9%. Three deaths were related to acute coronary occlusion. The absence of immediate surgical help did not influence the outcome in any patient. CONCLUSION--With careful selection of patients coronary angioplasty may be safely performed in a hospital without on site cardiac surgical facilities, provided that these are available at a nearby centre.\r"

Median (range) arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions were 4.4 (3.5-7.2) kPa and 8.7 (5.5-10.9) kPa respectively, with four patients breathing air and two controlled concentrations of oxygen. The arterial oxygen tension increased with mechanical ventilation to a median (range) of 8.7 (8.0-12.6) kPa and the carbon dioxide tension fell to 8.2 (6.5-9.2) kPa. Four patients discharged after a median of 10 (8-17) days in hospital were well five to 22 months later. One died at four days of worsening sputum retention and another after five weeks using the ventilator for 12-16 hours each day while awaiting heart-lung transplantation. This technique of mechanical ventilation avoids endotracheal intubation and can be used intermittently. Hypercapnic respiratory failure can be relieved in patients with either restrictive or obstructive lung disease in whom controlled oxygen treatment results in unacceptable hypercapnia. Respiratory assistance can be tailored to individual need and undertaken without conventional intensive care facilities.\r"

PATIENTS--12 Patients referred consecutively to the clinic in whom a diagnosis of sleepwalking (six) or night terrors (six) was confirmed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Psychological characteristics as measured at the time of clinical assessment by means of the Eysenck personality questionnaire, the hostility and direction of hostility questionnaire, and the Crown-Crisp experiential index. RESULTS--Both groups scored exceptionally highly on the hysteria scale of the Crown-Crisp experiential index and the night terrors group also scored highly on the anxiety scale. The patients with sleepwalking also scored highly on a measure of externally directed hostility. CONCLUSIONS--The physiological and psychological features identified in these patients, possibly reflecting different expressions of a constitutional cerebral characteristic, may be explored in terms of hysterical dissociation. The findings contribute to the debate concerning the nature of sleepwalking, in particular with and without the forensic aspects.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the factors influencing the risk of an acute traumatic intracranial haematoma in children and adults with a recent head injury. DESIGN--Prospective study of incidence of risk factors in samples of patients attending accident and emergency departments and in all patients having an acute traumatic intracranial haematoma evacuated in one regional neurosurgical unit during 11 years. SETTING--Accident and emergency departments in Scotland or Teesside and regional neurosurgical centre in Glasgow. PATIENTS--8406 Adults and children (less than or equal to 14 years) who attended accident and emergency departments and 1007 consecutive patients who had an operation for an acute traumatic intracranial haematoma. Data were complete in 8366 and 960 patients respectively. RESULTS--Overall, children were less at risk than adults (one in 2100 v one in 348 respectively). In both age groups the presence of a skull fracture and changes in conscious level permitted identification of subgroups of patients with widely differing degrees of risk. In children the absolute risk ranged from one in almost 13,000 without a fracture or altered conscious level to one in 12 for a child in a coma and with a fracture; the pattern was similar in adults, the risks in corresponding groups ranging from one in almost 7900 to one in four. CONCLUSIONS--Although children attending hospital after a head injury have a lower overall risk of a traumatic haematoma, the main indicators of risk, a skull fracture and conscious level, are the same as in adults, and the pattern of their combined effect is similar. Guidelines for managing adults with recent head injury may therefore be applied safely to children; with the increasing provision of facilities for computed tomography they should be revised to ensure early scanning of more patients with head injury.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Aspects of quality of outpatient care (blood testing, clinic attendance, and prophylactic drug treatment) and family care (adequate support and carers' knowledge about the disease) as assessed by reviewing the notes and administering a semistructured questionnaire to the carers, in relation to a devised list of standards deemed necessary to ensure achievement of the aims of screening. RESULTS--There were 93 outpatient attendances during the previous 12 months, but 13 children had not attended at least every six months and four not at all for more than a year. Only eight children had had three of the blood tests considered to be necessary for good care; three had had none. Prophylactic treatment with penicillin and folic acid was erratic; three children with sickle cell anaemia were not receiving regular prophylactic penicillin. IMPLICATION--Diagnosis of sickle cell disease on neonatal screening must be linked with follow up to ensure optimal management.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To ascertain the proportion of endoscopic examinations with normal findings in patients referred for gastroscopy through hospital medical staff or directly by their general practitioner and to assess the likely effect of targeting endoscopy in older patients. DESIGN--Retrospective audit of the gastroscopy practice of one consultant from 1986 to 1988 from information recorded on a standard form completed at the time of the examination, which contained details of patients, their endoscopic findings, and mode of referral (open access or clinic). SETTING--One district general hospital. PATIENTS--1545 Consecutive patients from primary catchment area attending for their first gastroscopy; 454 were referred through the outpatient clinic or by hospital colleagues (clinic group) and 1091 were accepted for endoscopy solely on their general practitioner's clinical diagnosis (open access group). RESULTS--Similar numbers (about 40%) of examinations with normal findings were performed in each group, although in patients aged over 40 the proportion with normal findings was significantly higher in the clinic group (p less than 0.03). Endoscopic evidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulceration, and gastroduodenal inflammation was equally common in each group; upper gastrointestinal malignancy, however, was significantly more common in patients referred through hospital doctors (5%, 23/454 v 2%, 22/1091 respectively; p less than 0.005) (although many of these patients had already been extensively investigated). IMPLICATIONS--Open access gastroscopy does not increase the number of unnecessary examinations and should become more widely available. Targeting this service to patients aged over 40 would reduce the number of requests but increase the diagnostic yield.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess changes in the organisation and performance of cervical cytology programmes in the practices of members of the Vale of Trent faculty of the Royal College of General Practitioners. DESIGN--Retrospective audits completed in 1985 and 1988 by general practitioners on a sequential sample of 100 records of women aged 35-64 in their practice. SETTING--General practices in which one or more partners were members or associates of the Vale of Trent faculty of the college, of which 76 participated in the first audit and 55 (82% of 67 eligible practices) in the second. SUBJECTS--Sequential samples of 100 women born between 1 January 1920 and 31 December 1949 (first audit) and between 1 January 1923 and 31 December 1952 (second audit) whose surnames began with P or B respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Percentage of women in each practice with a record of cervical cytology performed in the previous five years and percentage with no recorded smear. RESULTS--Of the 76 practices completing the audit in 1985, 55 (82% of those eligible) repeated the exercise in 1988. Performance was not significantly different in practices that did and did not respond. The median percentage of women who had had a smear in the previous five years was 49% and 69% in 1985 and 1988 respectively (p less than 0.001) and that of women with no record of a cervical smear was 28% and 16% respectively (p less than 0.001). All but six practices showed improvement in both outcome measures. In both audits an active call system was associated with a significantly increased performance (p less than 0.05). In nine practices (16%) 80% or more of the samples of women had had a smear in the previous five years. CONCLUSION--Organisation and performance of practices audited improved between 1985 and 1988. Although this might result from participation in the first audit, it probably represents a more general trend within primary care. ACTION--Between the two audits more practices (87% v 67%) had developed a policy on screening, and this was more likely to include the aim of performing regular smears on all sexually active women (98% v 80%).\r"

  ".U": "90181760\r", 
  ".W": "An investigation into an outbreak of food poisoning caused by Clostridium perfringens showed evidence of poor food handling by catering staff. The reasons behind this were explored by interviewing catering staff, analysing shifts and rotas, and looking at staff vacancies. Morale was low because of staff shortages resulting from a long term recruitment problem. In consequence staff were working double shifts and often for weeks on end without a day off. The reasons for the recruitment problem included the difficulty of recruiting semiskilled labour from a middle class area, low wages, lack of management support, and the poor image of the hospital as a place of work. Similar factors affect the recruitment and retention of ancillary staff nationally. The NHS has a poor record as an employer of ancillary staff, paying lower wages than other organisations for equivalent posts. Competitive tendering has further worsened the position of ancillary staff, with the result that good quality of care and service has often not been achieved. The NHS Review, with its emphasis on quality of care, makes no mention of ancillary staff. Yet high standards of ancillary provision are essential if further outbreaks of food poisoning in hospitals are to be prevented.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years the Ontario government has been concerned that the proportion of public expenditures devoted to health care is at an all-time high. In addition, the media have devoted considerable attention to specific incidents that may represent inadequate funding of hospital services. To shed light on the debate on health care expenditures we analysed the trend in expenditures of Ontario's hospital sector in the 1980s in terms of the amount of inputs (e.g., labour) used to produce hospital services (e.g., a patient-day or admission) and after adjustment for general inflation. As in the 1970s the number of inputs grew relatively slowly during the 1980s. Inputs per patient-day grew at an annual rate of 0.46% and inputs per admission at an annual rate of 2.4%. Cost increases were largely accounted for by hospital wage increases; this could have been due to Ontario's rapidly expanding economy. These findings indicate that Ontario has continued to be successful in containing the number of inputs used in the hospital sector. However, after two decades of substantial success with publicly acceptable cost control, the government faces increased scrutiny as the media and the public focus attention on several areas of perceived inadequate funding in health care services.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen patients with unresectable localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated by a combination of chemotherapy plus hyperfractionated radiation therapy to the pancreas for 4080 cGy with an additional 960 cGy to the pancreatic tumor and a surrounding margin. One hundred and twenty cGy were given twice daily 4 to 6 hours apart. High-energy photon or electron beams were used with treatment planning based on computed tomographic (CT) scans. Patients were given chemotherapy in the form of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at 350 mg/m2 on the first 3 and last 3 days of radiation therapy. On day 53, chemotherapy was given that included 600 mg/m2 IV of 5-FU, 1 gm/m2 of streptozotocin, and 10 mg/m2 IV of mitomycin C. The 5-FU and streptozotocin were repeated on days 60, 81, and 88, and the stretozotocin and mitomycin (SMF) cycles were repeated every 8 weeks until progression. Radiation toxicity was generally tolerable with one of 18 evaluable patients having severe nausea and vomiting and two of 18 patients having severe diarrhea. One patient had total liver failure and died 3 months after initiation of therapy. Six patients had severe hematopoietic toxicity during chemotherapy. Overall, the severe toxicity rate was higher (67%) than in previous studies. Median survival was 35 weeks, the 1-year survival rate was 39%, and the patient who survived the longest died at 68 months. Although this schedule of hyperfractionated radiation and chemotherapy was disappointing, combined experimental radiation approaches plus chemotherapy for localized unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas deserve additional research.\r"

  ".W": "Intraperitoneal chemotherapy with mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil has been used to rescue patients from peritoneal carcinomatosis after perforated cystadenocarcinoma of the large bowel or appendix. A staging celiotomy was used to asses the results of therapy. In nine patients tumor was recovered from the abdominal cavity and was subjected to careful histopathologic examination. The posttreatment appearance of the tumor was compared with that before treatment. Also, tumor deposits harvested from these same patients, but from anatomic sites not directly exposed to chemotherapy were examined. The most striking findings observed in treated patients were as follows: (1) the marked reduction in the number of foci of atypical neoplastic epithelium lining the mucin globules, and (2) atrophy and degeneration of the atypical neoplastic epithelium. All treated patients showed these effects but they were not in all sampled tumor specimens, suggesting nonuniform drug distribution in the abdominal cavity and limited penetration of chemotherapy into tumor. The authors conclude that intraperitoneal chemotherapy produces marked histologic changes in mucinous tumors when there is direct contact between tumor and intracavitary drugs.\r"

Associated tumors other than neurofibromas included multiple leiomyomas, meningioma, neurofibrosarcoma, and prostatic sarcoma. Seven tumors had psammoma bodies, and in three they were numerous. Somatostatin-positive cells were demonstrated in all cases. Two tumors had spread to regional lymph nodes at the time of surgery. There appears to be a predilection for black patients among those with VRD and duodenal carcinoids.\r"

  ".W": "The persistency of fibrin deposits in the kidney during renal diseases could reflect either a defective release of plasminogen activators (PA) or a local excess of PAI. In order to investigate this question, we studied human renal biopsies by immunofluorescence technique with specific antibodies for fibrin, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase (u-PA), PAI-1 and PAI-2. By this technique t-PA could be detected in the glomerular flocculus and the endothelium of small arteries of the normal control kidneys. We failed to detect significant fluorescence with other antibodies in normal kidneys. Conversely, in cases of vascular nephropathy with thrombosis the positive fluorescence obtained with anti-fibrin antibodies at the site of thrombosis was associated with a positive fluorescence with anti-PAI-1 and to a lesser extent with anti-t-PA antibodies. u-PA and PAI-2 were not detected in these lesions. Similarly in the most severe forms of crescentic glomerulonephritis, extracapillary fibrin deposits were associated with PAI-1. In one case u-PA was also detected. This is in agreement with our previous findings that glomerular epithelial cells release both PAI-1 and the inactive form of u-PA (pro u-PA). Thus, our results support the hypothesis that PAI-1, which is able to inhibit both t-PA and u-PA, may play a major role in the persistency of fibrin deposits in the human kidneys during pathological conditions.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the IgA deposits found in glomeruli of IgA nephropathy, frozen sections of renal biopsy specimens from 191 consecutive patients with IgA nephropathy were examined by immunofluorescent microscopy. All 191 specimens were positive for IgA1 in glomeruli. IgA2 was detected in 3 out of these 191 specimens. Both kappa and lambda light chains were also detected in the glomeruli of all specimens. The presence of J chain was represented in 113 specimens after acid-urea pretreatment. Secretory component (SC) was detected in 13 out of the 191 specimens, but not in controls. Both J chain and SC were detected in 2 out of 3 specimens positive for IgA2 but not for IgM. These results suggest that IgA deposited in glomeruli in some patients with IgA nephropathy is perhaps mucosally derived IgA.\r"

  ".W": "1. To study the importance of cardiac innervation in the regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels were measured during symptom-limited, graded exercise on a cycle ergometer in seven male orthotopic cardiac transplant recipients. 2. Resting plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was significantly higher in the transplant recipients than in two control groups, one matched to the transplant recipients (group I) and the other to the age of the donor heart (group II). 3. The response to exercise of the cardiac transplant recipients was compared with the response of control group II. Mean maximal work load achieved with exercise was around 40% lower in the cardiac transplant recipients. During exercise, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels increased in both the cardiac transplant recipients and the control subjects. The increase in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide with exercise was greater in absolute, but less in percentage, terms in transplant recipients than in the control subjects. 4. The increase in mean arterial pressure with exercise was similar in patients and in control subjects; however, heart rate increased in the patients by only 33% compared with a rise of 151% in the control group. 5. These results provide insight into the control of the sodium regulatory hormone atrial natriuretic peptide. First, factors other than a change in heart rate appear of importance in the regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide. Secondly, these findings suggest that cardiac innervation is not of dominant importance in the modulation of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion.\r"

However, the mere presence of T lymphocytes with cytotoxic/suppressor phenotype in the hepatic inflammatory infiltrate does not necessarily imply that these cells are actively involved in an immune reaction. In the present study, the expression of different activation antigens have been investigated, such as the interleukin-2 and the transferrin receptors and a recently described T-cell activation molecule termed \"activation-inducer molecule\" on the different lymphocyte subsets of both peripheral blood and liver-infiltrating lymphocytes from patients with virus-induced chronic active hepatitis. Studies of double immunostaining clearly showed that the majority of intrahepatic CD8+ T lymphocytes selectively coexpressed the activation-inducer molecule, whereas no significant expression of this molecule was found on either intrahepatic CD4+ T lymphocytes or peripheral blood lymphocytes of the same patients. Furthermore, lymphocytes from both peripheral blood or liver compartments did not express other activation antigens such as the interleukin-2 and the transferrin-receptor molecules. These results suggest that the CD8+ T-cell subset bearing the activation-inducer molecule may represent the main activated intrahepatic lymphoid cell population in virus-related chronic active hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor in liver cirrhosis can be affected by various factors, such as ascites, renal function, use of diuretics drugs and dietary sodium intake. Moreover, the influence of high intra-abdominal pressure on cardiac atrial natriuretic factor release in patients with tense ascites has not been investigated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the circulating levels of atrial natriuretic factor and their relationships to plasma renin activity, aldosterone concentration, and urinary sodium excretion in 45 cirrhotic patients divided into 4 groups: (a) cirrhotics without ascites; (b) nonazotemic cirrhotics with ascites; (c) cirrhotics with ascites and functional renal failure; and (d) cirrhotics with ascites taking diuretics. In some patients with tense ascites, atrial natriuretic factor was also measured after rapid abdominal relaxation by large volume paracentesis. Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor obtained in 13 healthy control subjects after 5 days on a 40-50 mEq sodium daily intake were 22.8 +/- 3.3 pg/ml. Mean plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels were normal in patients without ascites (35.1 +/- 11.4 pg/ml) and in those with ascites taking diuretics (27 +/- 9.2 pg/ml), but elevated in patients with ascites not taking diuretics (59.6 +/- 12 pg/ml) and in those with ascites and functional renal failure (58.5 +/- 16.6 pg/ml). These data show that plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels are elevated only in cirrhotic patients who are ascitic and not taking diuretics. In these patients atrial natriuretic factor levels were directly correlated with urinary sodium excretion, even though sodium balance was positive. This could be the consequence of the contrasting effects of antinatriuretic factors, as suggested by the inverse relationships between atrial natriuretic factor and urinary sodium on the one hand and plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration on the other. Twenty-six patients with tense ascites (12 taking diuretics and 14 not) were treated with rapid large-volume paracentesis (6500 +/- 330 ml of ascitic fluid removed in 168 +/- 16 min). At the end of the procedure, plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels had increased in all patients (from 45.5 +/- 10.1 to 100 +/- 17 pg/ml), whereas plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration had decreased (from 10.3 +/- 1.6 to 7 +/- 1.3 ng/ml/h, and 1160 +/- 197 to 781 +/- 155 pg/ml, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Initial colonoscopy detected more cases of polyps less than 9 mm in size, adenomas, and arteriovenous malformations but fewer cases of diverticulosis. No significant difference was found between strategies in the number of patients detected with cancers or polyps greater than or equal to 9 mm in size. In both strategies, cancers were more common in subjects aged greater than or equal to 55 yr (8% overall) than in those aged less than 55 yr (1%). Among patients aged less than 55 yr with suspected lower gastrointestinal bleeding, initial flexible sigmoidoscopy plus air contrast barium enema is a more cost-effective strategy for the detection of colonic neoplasms than initial colonoscopy. However, initial colonoscopy is more cost effective for those aged greater than or equal to 55 yr.\r"

This question was examined in anesthetized, ventilated rats by exposing the ileum to secretory agents with different mechanisms of action. Four hours after inoculation of ileal loops with either cholera toxin or saline, transport was measured during perfusion with Ringer's solution, with Ringer's solution containing Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin or mannitol, or with Ringer's solution containing both heat-stable enterotoxin and mannitol. We found that heat-stable enterotoxin caused similar decrements in water absorption in loops exposed to Ringer's solution, hypertonic mannitol, cholera toxin, and cholera toxin plus mannitol. By contrast, the decrement in water transport caused by hypertonic mannitol was inversely related to the level of ongoing water transport. In addition, the electrolyte transport changes caused by each enterotoxin were preserved despite the presence of other secretory agents. These data suggest that the transport effects of secretagogues with different mechanisms of action are additive in the ileum. However, the absolute decrements in water absorption may be independent of (heat-stable enterotoxin and cholera toxin) or dependent on (hypertonic mannitol) the ongoing level of water transport.\r"

Synthetic prostaglandin E analogues administered orally at a dose of 20-50 micrograms/kg 15 min before the meal did not modify the postprandial pattern of gastric contractions but suppressed the spontaneous postprandial irregular activity on the jejunum and induced a cyclic pattern of migrating motor complexes for 4-6 h after the meal. These postprandial migrating motor complexes induced by prostaglandin E were propagated between the two recording sites and had a period similar to that observed in the fasted state. However, the duration of phase 2 was significantly increased and the amplitude of the phase 3 decreased. This jejunal cyclic motor pattern was reproduced by administration of synthetic prostaglandin E derivatives either intravenously (4-10 micrograms/kg) 15 min before the meal or intracerebroventricularly (50 ng/kg) 1 h after the meal. The intestinal migrating motor complex activity observed after oral administration of synthetic prostaglandin E derivatives was abolished by the previous intracerebroventricular (40 micrograms/kg) but not intravenous (200 micrograms/kg) administration of SC-19220, a receptor antagonist of prostaglandin E. These results suggest that oral administration of synthetic prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol) or prostaglandin E2 (enprostil) analogues before a meal induces postprandial migrating motor complexes on the jejunum in dogs through a mechanism involving central prostaglandin receptors.\r"

Immunized animals underwent laparotomy and nontraumatic pyloric occlusion using a microvascular clamp. Following wound closure, animals were gavage-fed ovalbumin together with di-DNP-lysine. Other mice were subjected to systemic anaphylaxis by intravenous injection of di-DNP-lysine administered 1 min after gavage feeding of ovalbumin. The intravenous and intragastric administration of di-DNP-lysine led to a sixfold or greater increase in serum immunoreactive ovalbumin. Examination of 1-micron sections of gastric tissue from DNP-Asc-immunized and unimmunized mice showed an intact mucosal and submucosal architecture. A 75% increase in the number of mast cells below the muscularis mucosa was seen in immunized compared with unimmunized BDF1 mice. Gastric tissue sections from immunized mice challenged orally or intravenously with di-DNP-lysine showed compaction of erythrocytes in blood vessels, degranulation of mast cells, degenerative changes in the gastric epithelium, expulsion of mucus from gastric glands, and edema in the lamina propria. The present model may be useful for further defining the consequences of anaphylaxis on the development of immune responses to dietary antigens.\r"

  ".W": "Concentration and voltage dependence of unidirectional magnesium fluxes across the stripped mucosa of the rat terminal ileum were measured in an Ussing chamber. The mucosa-to-serosa magnesium flux exhibited a curvilinear concentration dependence, whereas serosa-to-mucosa flux of magnesium was linearly related to magnesium concentration between 0.25 and 5 mM. At low concentrations magnesium was absorbed, whereas at the magnesium concentration of 5 mM the serosa-to-mucosa magnesium flux was higher than the mucosa-to-serosa flux, resulting in magnesium secretion. Only the mucosa-to-serosa flux of magnesium had a voltage-independent (i.e., nondiffusive) cellular component. Due to the high capacity of this cellular mucosa-to-serosa transport of magnesium, which was about 7.5 times greater than that of calcium, absorption of magnesium was performed in the terminal ileum in contrast to calcium, which was secreted under the same conditions. However, magnesium serosa-to-mucosa flux was totally voltage dependent (i.e., diffusive) and probably restricted to the paracellular pathway. The diffusive serosa-to-mucosa flux of magnesium was about two times greater than the diffusive fraction of the mucosa-to-serosa transport of magnesium. The prevalence of the diffusive serosa-to-mucosa flux of magnesium over that from mucosa to serosa, responsible for magnesium secretion observed at the magnesium concentration of 5 mM, may be explained by an \"anomalous solvent drag effect.\" Voltage clamp experiments showed that magnesium had no effect on the cellular mucosa-to-serosa transport of calcium. However, it decreased the diffusive calcium flux in this direction. 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 did not influence the unidirectional or net magnesium transport but increased the calcium flux in both directions to the same degree. In conclusion, magnesium is absorbed in the terminal ileum at least partially by a cellular, vitamin D3-insensitive process that is different from the calcium transport mechanism.\r"

Patients receiving flumazenil were fully alert and able to ambulate 5 min after injection with this medication. Performances at 30 min in the Trieger, Number Connection, and Digit Symbol tests were significantly better in the group receiving flumazenil, p less than 0.005, p less than 0.025, and p less than 0.01, respectively. No phlebitis, nausea, vomiting, or anxiety were noted. No resedation events were documented.

When compared with normal saline, acetate perfusion was associated with luminal alkalinisation. There was no difference in total CO2 secretion when similar rates of acetate and glucose absorption were compared, suggesting that total CO2 secretion was the result of mucosal metabolism. Absorption of acetate and propionate were mutually inhibitory. Acetate absorption was also inhibited by Tris-Hepes pH 7.0. When the gut was pretreated with cholera toxin to induce a secretory state, acetate absorption was reduced by 41.9%. This effect could be reproduced if similar water secretion was osmotically induced by the addition of mannitol. These data suggest that acetate is absorbed, at least, partially by non-ionic diffusion in the rat jejunum and that its absorption is reduced in the secreting intestine by solvent drag.\r"

  ".W": "13CO2 starch breath test was used to study the effect of physicochemical characteristics of starch digestion. As starch is hydrolysed to glucose, which is subsequently oxidised to CO2, differences in 13CO2 excretion after ingestion of different starch products must be caused by differences in hydrolysis rate. To study the effect of the degree of chain branching, waxy starch, containing 98% amylopectin, was compared with high amylose starch, containing 30% amylopectin, and normal crystalline starch, containing 74% amylopectin. The effect of the extent of gelatinisation was studied by comparing extruded starch and crystalline starch. Finally, the possible inhibitory effect of adding wheat fibre to extruded starch on the hydrolysis rate was studied. The 13CO2 excretion from two to four hours after intake of crystalline starch was significantly lower than that of extruded starch. Waxy starch was hydrolysed much faster than high amylose starch, but there was no significant difference between waxy starch and normal crystalline starch. Addition of wheat fibre did not influence the hydrolysis rate. The 13CO2 starch breath test is an attractive test for the study of factors affecting carbohydrate assimilation.\r"

After the administration of thioacetamide together with supportive therapy, acute hepatocellular failure developed in rats as a result of massive hepatocellular necrosis without evidence of renal failure or hypoglycemia. The evolution of hepatic encephalopathy in this model was sufficiently slow to readily permit the staging of the syndrome. Prominent features of the encephalopathy include a marked reduction in open field activity and an abnormal visual evoked response. Both the deficits in spontaneous motor function and visual evoked response abnormalities of rats in stages III to IV hepatic encephalopathy were significantly improved after the administration of the benzodiazepine receptor ligands flumazenil or Ro 15-4513. Doses of flumazenil or Ro 15-4513 that produced these effects in rats with hepatic encephalopathy had no detectable action on either the behavior or the visual evoked responses of normal rats. The ability of benzodiazepine receptor ligands to ameliorate both the behavioral depression and the visual evoked response abnormalities associated with hepatic encephalopathy in the thioacetamide-induced rat model suggest an involvement of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, the similarity of these observations to those in rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy caused by galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure is compatible with the hypothesis that the mechanisms of hepatic encephalopathy in these two distinct models share a common final pathway, the allosteric enhancement of GABAergic tone through the benzodiazepine receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measurements were done in the resting state after an overnight fast (10 to 12 hr). Oxygen consumption (ml/min/1.73 m2) in normal subjects, in patients with acute hepatitis and in patients with cirrhosis was 206.5 +/- 4.0 (mean +/- S.E.M.), 216.4 +/- 4.7 and 228.8 +/- 7.1 (p less than 0.05 vs. controls), respectively. When related to body surface area (kcal/min/1.73 m2), resting energy expenditure did not differ between normal subjects (0.98 +/- 0.02), patients with acute hepatitis (1.03 +/- 0.02) and cirrhotic patients (1.06 +/- 0.03). However, when related to 24-hr urinary creatinine excretion as an estimate of lean body mass, energy expenditure was increased in cirrhosis (p less than 0.0001). In cirrhosis an inverse association between the severity of liver disease according to Pugh and oxygen consumption and resting energy expenditure was found. In cirrhotic patients the percentages of total calories derived from fat (86% +/- 5%), carbohydrate (2% +/- 4%) and protein (12% +/- 1%) were different from those of normal controls who metabolized 45% +/- 4%, 38% +/- 4%, 17% +/- 1%, respectively. In acute hepatitis no alterations in metabolism could be found apart from a decreased protein oxidation rate. In conclusion no appreciable changes in energy metabolism exist in acute hepatitis.

  ".W": "We measured the pH of airway surface liquid (ASL) secreted by the ferret trachea in vitro by using a catheter-tipped pH electrode implanted in a collecting cannula close to the airway epithelium. Mucus secretion was promoted by methacholine (0.02 mmol/l) in the organ bath. The pH of the ASL was 6.85 +/- 0.03 (SE) compared with a bath value of 7.39 +/- 0.01, when the bath was bubbled with 5.65% CO2. Changing the bath CO2 from 0 to 20.93% CO2 altered the bath pH from 8.06 to 6.96, but the ASL pH only varied from 6.92 to 6.85. This homeostasis of ASL pH was not the result of the buffering powers of the ASL, because ex situ buffer curves for secreted ASL were similar to those for Krebs-Henseleit solution. Changing the luminal CO2 content by blowing gases through the trachea changed ASL pH by values similar to that ex situ. However, when external organ bath CO2 was changed, the luminal CO2 changes were proportionately far smaller. Measurement of rates of diffusion of CO2 across the tracheal wall indicated that this was not a limiting factor in the results. Similarly, measurement of metabolic rate CO2 production in the tracheal lumen indicated that this did not significantly affect the results. We conclude that the pH of ASL is significantly on the acid side of the pH or interstitial fluid and plasma and that it is maintained relatively constant despite large changes in external pH.\r"

  ".W": "Polycations, including protamine, have been reported to decrease the barrier integrity of cultured rat pulmonary type II epithelial monolayers. In contrast, protamine has been reported to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance of gallbladder epithelium. The present study was done using Madin Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK) to determine whether the effect of protamine on type II epithelial monolayers was species or organ specific or was dependent on the presence of nonepithelial cells and to investigate the effect of protamine on the actin cytoskeleton. Exposure of MDCK monolayers to protamine resulted in decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (Rt), increased short-circuit current (Isc) across the monolayers, and increased mannitol permeability (Pmann) of the monolayers. The decrease in Rt and increase in Isc was seen only after the addition of protamine to the apical surface of the cells. The importance of charge in this action was supported by the fact that exposure of the monolayer to the polycation poly-L-lysine also resulted in increased Pmann, and both the decreased Rt and increased Pmann seen after the addition of protamine were prevented if the monolayers were exposed in the presence of the polyanions heparin or sulfated dextran. The increase in Pmann appeared to be the result of increased permeability in the paracellular pathway, because increased mannitol uptake by the cells represented only a fraction of the increase in Pmann. Subtle changes in the actin cytoskeleton were seen after exposure of the monolayers to protamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measurements were made to establish in vivo plasma [H+] at rest and during submaximal exercise, and CO2 titration of blood was completed for both in vitro and acute in vivo conditions. In 19 ponies arterial plasma [H+] was decreased from rest 4.5 neq/l (P less than 0.05) during the 7th min of treadmill running at 6 mph, 5% grade (P less than 0.5). A 5.6-Torr exercise hypocapnia accounted for approximately 2.9 neq/l of this reduced [H+]. The non-PCO2 component of this alkalosis was approximately neq/l, and it was due presumably to a 1.7-meq/l increase from rest in the plasma strong ion difference (SID). Despite the arterial hypocapnia, mixed venous PCO2 was 2.7 Torr above rest during steady-state exercise. Nevertheless, mixed venous plasma [H+] was 1.2 neq/l above rest during exercise, which was presumably due to the increase in SID. Also studied was the effect of submaximal exercise on whole blood CO2 content (CCO2). In vitro, at a given PCO2 there was minimal difference in CCO2 between rest and exercise blood, but plasma [HCO3-] was greater for exercise blood than for rest blood. In vivo, during steady-state exercise, arterial plasma blood. In vivo, during steady-state exercise, arterial plasma [HCO3-] was unchanged or slightly elevated from rest, but CaCO2 was 4 vol% below rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arterial and mixed venous blood were simultaneously sampled in 12 ponies during eucapnia and 5-60 min after Paco2 had changed. In vitro data were obtained by equilibrating blood in a tonometer at five different levels of PCO2.

Venous PCO2 was increased by insufflating the gut with high CO2 while recording changes in the amplitude of the sternal movements. Arterial blood gases were held constant by unidirectionally ventilating the lungs with gas flows approximately five times the animal's resting minute volume. Insufflating the gut with 90% N2-10% O2 did not change the level of ventilation, whereas with 90% CO2-10% O2 the amplitude of sternal movement increased 500% above that with no gut gas flow. Exchange of N2 for the CO2 was followed by a rapid reduction of ventilatory movements to control levels. Arterial blood gases remained constant during gut gas insufflation, whereas mixed venous PCO2 increased and mixed venous pH decreased when high CO2 was given to the gut. Cutting the middle cardiac nerves, which primarily innervate the ventricles of the heart, reduced the ventilatory response to CO2 gut insufflation by 67%. Sympathetic denervation of the thoracic viscera did not change the responses. It appears that, in the chicken, increasing the mixed venous PCO2 while holding the arterial blood gases constant alters ventilation by an afferent system located in the venous circulation or in the right ventricle which is sensitive to changes in PCO2.\r"

The influence of the central chemoreflex on G'p is generally less than 10% but can become disproportionally more significant as the relative contribution of the peripheral chemoreflex diminishes. G'p tends to overestimate Gp with the inclusion of peripheral chemoreceptor rate sensitivity, but this effect is offset by the time constant for adaptation. The spontaneous variability of breathing can seriously impair the resolution of G'p. Averaging of G'p deduced from individual single-breath tests can lead to erroneous estimates of Gp even when a large number of repetitions are performed. This problem can be minimized by first ensemble averaging the data from individual single-breath tests and, then, computing G'p from the resulting mean changes.\r"

Peak phrenic and SCS activity were measured in nine anesthetized, paralyzed, peripherally chemodenervated, vagotomized cats. PBH was produced by inhalation of 0.5% CO in 40% O2 while blood pressure and end-tidal CO2 were maintained constant. A progressive reduction in arterial O2 content from 14.3 +/- 0.6 to 4.5 +/- 0.3 vol% caused a 79 +/- 7% depression of peak phrenic activity and an 84 +/- 10% reduction of iSCS activity, but tSCS activity increased 42 +/- 21%. During CO2 rebreathing, iSCS activity increased in parallel with peak phrenic activity while tSCS activity was unchanged. The slopes of the CO2 responses of both phrenic (6.3 +/- 1.2%max/mmHg) and iSCS (4.6 +/- 0.8%max/mmHg) activity were unaffected by PBH.

Electromyographic (EMG) activity indicative of shivering thermogenesis was inhibited during hypoxia, and body temperature (Tre) fell by 0.09 degrees C/min. Respiratory frequency (f) and minute ventilation (VE) increased by 143 and 135%, respectively, compared with normoxia, but tidal volume (VT) was not changed. PO2, PCO2, and O2 contents in the arterial and mixed venous blood were decreased and pH was enhanced. During normocapnic hypoxia, shivering EMG was present at approximately 50% of the normoxic intensity; Tre fell by only 0.04 degrees C/min. Arterial and mixed venous PCO2 and pH were the same as during normoxia, but VE increased by 430% because of twofold increases in both f and VT. During normocapnic hypoxia, arterial PO2 and O2 content were higher than during hypoxia alone. We conclude that the persistence of shivering during normocapnic hypoxia is due to maintenance of critical levels of arterial PO2 and O2 content.\r"

This intervention did not significantly alter the difference in PaCO2 between N2-O2 and He-O2 from that observed in the intact animals, although the individual PaCO2 values for each gas mixture did increase. When the PaCO2 was plotted against stagnation pressure (rho V2), the difference in PaCO2 between N2-O2 and He-O2 was nearly abolished in both the closed- and open-chest animals. These findings suggest that the different PaCO2's obtained by insufflating gases with different physical properties at a fixed flow rate, catheter position, and lung volume result mainly from a difference in the properties of the jet.\r"

  ".W": "Loss of a major portion of lung tissue has been associated with impaired exercise capacity, but the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. We studied the alterations in gas exchange during exercise before and after left pneumonectomy in three conditioned foxhounds. After pneumonectomy, minute ventilation and O2 consumption at comparable submaximal work loads were unchanged but arterial PCO2 at any work load was higher, implying that ventilatory response to CO2 was impaired. Arterial hypoxemia and an elevated alveolar-arterial O2 tension difference (AaDO2) developed during heavy exercise. Using the multiple inert gas elimination technique, we determined the distributions of ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) ratios postpneumonectomy. Significant increase in VA/Q inequality developed during exercise while the foxhounds were breathing room air, accounting for an average of 42% of the total increase in AaDO2 while diffusion limitation accounted for 58%. While the animals were breathing hypoxic gas mixture, diffusion limitation accounted for an average of 88% of the total increase AaDO2. Cardiac output and O2 delivery were reduced at a given O2 consumption after pneumonectomy. After pneumonectomy, the animals reached O2 consumptions close to the maximum expected for normal dogs. Compensation for the impairment in O2 delivery post-pneumonectomy occurred mainly by an increase in hemoglobin concentration. Training probably played an important role in returning exercise capacity toward prepneumonectomy levels. We conclude that significant abnormalities in gas exchange develop during exercise after loss of 42% of lung tissue, but the animals demonstrate a remarkable ability to compensate for these changes.\r"

The A-10 cells have a single class of high affinity binding sites for ET with an apparent Mr of 65,000-75,000 on SDS-PAGE. Stimulation of cells with ET induces mobilization of Ca2+ from both intra- and extracellular pools to produce a biphasic increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration. ET increases cellular levels of inositol trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol, indicating activation of phospholipase C by ET. ET stimulates production of inositol phosphates in membranes prepared from A-10 cells in the presence of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), but not in its absence. Further, specific binding of 125I-labeled ET to A-10 cell membranes is shown to be inhibited by GTP gamma S in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of A-10 cells with pertussis toxin induces ADP-ribosylation of a 41,000-D membrane protein but fails to block the ET-induced increases in inositol phosphate production and Ca2+ mobilization. These results indicate that the receptor for ET is coupled to phospholipase C via a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein which is distinct from the pertussis toxin substrate in A-10 cells.\r"

In hypothyroid animals, both synthesis and abundance of apo A-I mRNA was reduced to half of control values. After injection of a receptor-saturating dose of triiodothyronine into euthyroid rats, apo A-I gene transcription increased at 20 min, reached a maximum of 179% of control (P less than 0.01) at 3.5 h, and remained elevated for up to 48 h. The abundance of nuclear and total cellular apo A-I mRNA increased at 1 and 2 h, respectively, and exceeded the levels expected from enhanced transcription more than two fold at 24 h after hormone injection. Upon chronic administration of thyroid hormones, levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic apo A-I mRNA remained elevated but transcription of the apo A-I gene fell to 42% of control (P less than 0.01). Thus, thyroid hormones rapidly stimulate apo A-I gene transcription. Posttranscriptional events leading to increased stability of nuclear apo A-I RNA precursors become the principal mechanism for enhanced gene expression in chronic hyperthyroidism and may cause feedback inhibition of apo A-I gene transcription. Our results furthermore imply that the majority of hepatic nuclear apo A-I RNA precursors are degraded in euthyroid animals.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the hypothesis that neutrophil proteases stimulate airway gland secretion, we studied the effect of human cathepsin G and elastase on secretion of 35S-labeled macromolecules from cultured bovine airway gland serous cells. Both proteases stimulated secretion in a concentration-dependent fashion with a threshold of greater than or equal to 10(-10) M. Elastase was more potent than cathepsin G, causing a maximal secretory response of 1,810 +/- 60% over baseline at 10(-8) M. The maximal response to cathepsin G (1,810 +/- 70% over baseline at 10(-7) M) was similar to the maximal response to elastase. These responses were greater than 10-fold larger than the response to other agonists such as histamine. Protease-induced secretion was noncytotoxic and required catalytically active enzymes. The predominant sulfated macromolecule released by proteases was chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated chondroitin sulfate in cytoplasmic granules and decreased granular staining after stimulation of cells with elastase. The neutrophil proteases also degraded the proteoglycan released from serous cells. Cathepsin G and elastase in supernatant obtained by degranulation of human peripheral neutrophils also caused a secretory response. Thus, neutrophil proteases stimulate airway gland serous cell secretion of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and degrade the secreted product. These findings suggest a potential role for neutrophil proteases in the pathogenesis of increased and abnormal submucosal gland secretions in diseases associated with inflammation and neutrophil infiltration of the airways.\r"

Antigens of Leishmania chagasi were evaluated by determining their ability to elicit in vitro proliferation and cytokine production in peripheral blood lymphocytes and in T cell lines and clones from patients with histories of leishmaniasis or Chagas' disease. Antigens tested were selected by their reactivity with patient antibodies. Several of the antigens induced proliferative responses in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients recovered from visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis or with chronic Chagas' disease. Two purified glycoproteins, 30 and 42 kD, were consistently among the most effective in eliciting high proliferative responses and IL-2 production. Lymphocytes from a recovered visceral leishmaniasis patient were used to produce T cell lines against either the 30- or 42-kD antigen. Each of the lines responded to both of these antigens as well as to crude leishmania lysate. CD4+ T cell clones specific for either or both of these antigens were also isolated from a visceral leishmaniasis patient. In contrast, rabbit antisera produced against these two antigens were not crossreactive. Both antigens were effective in inducing the production of IFN-gamma from T cell lines from both leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease patients. These studies demonstrate the potential for defining parasite antigens with broad immunostimulatory capabilities.\r"

At 1 h after right nephrectomy and arterial occlusion of the contralateral kidney for 10 or 30 min, Egr-1 mRNA levels were three to five times greater in these kidneys as compared with those in control animals that had sustained unilateral nephrectomy alone and were much greater than levels in the normal organ. Whether ischemia was imposed for 10 or for 30 min, renal Egr-1 mRNA contents were equivalent and remained elevated after 24 h of reperfusion subsequent to 30 min of ischemia. Although c-fos mRNA also accumulated in response to ischemia and reperfusion, the pattern differed from that of Egr-1 in that c-fos mRNA content varied with the duration of ischemia and was undetectable 24 h after injury. Contralateral nephrectomy was not necessary to see the marked accumulation of Egr-1 and c-fos mRNAs with unilateral ischemia. Reflow was necessary, however, since only minimal sequence accumulation occurred by the end of the ischemic period. After left uninephrectomy alone, Egr-1 mRNA levels in the remaining kidney were maximal 30 min after surgery, but were not detectable thereafter; c-fos mRNA levels did not change after unilateral nephrectomy. Differential expression of early growth-related genes implicated in transcriptional activation may influence tissue recovery after renal ischemia.\r"

  ".U": "90187075\r", 
  ".W": "The newly isolated peptide, endothelin-1 (ET-1), is a potent pressor agent that reduces GFR and the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient. Recent evidence demonstrates that ET-1 mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) in glomerular mesangial cells by activating the phosphoinositide cascade. The present experiments were designed to examine whether ET-1 stimulates mesangial cell contraction and regulates the synthesis of PGE2 and cAMP, which dampen vasoconstrictor-induced mesangial contraction. ET-1 (greater than or equal to 1 nM) reduced the cross-sectional area of rat mesangial cells cultured on three-dimensional gels of collagen type I. ET-1 also caused complex rearrangements of F-actin microfilaments consistent with a motile response. Contraction in response to ET-1 occurred only at concentrations that activate phospholipase C, and contraction was unaffected by blockade of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Elevation of [Ca2+]i with ionomycin, to equivalent concentrations of [Ca2+]i achieved with ET-1, also reduced mesangial cell cross-sectional area. ET-1 (0.1 microM) also evoked [3H]arachidonate release and a fivefold increase in PGE2 synthesis as well as increased synthesis of PGF2 alpha and small changes of TXB2. ET-1 caused a minor increase in intracellular cAMP accumulation only in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. ET-1 also amplified cAMP production in response to isoproterenol. TPA and ionomycin, alone and in combination, failed to mimic the potentiating effect of ET-1; however, indomethacin blocked ET-1-induced potentiation of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP, which was restored by addition of exogenous 10 nM PGE2. Thus the present data demonstrate that ET-1 stimulates mesangial cell contraction via pharmacomechanical coupling and activates phospholipase A2 to produce PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and TXB2. ET-1 also amplified beta adrenergic-stimulated cAMP accumulation by a PGE2-dependent mechanism.\r"

Subjects were studied in the fasted state and on a second occasion in the fed state (small, physiological meals were given every hour for 15 h). Apolipoproteins were isolated by preparative gradient gel electrophoresis from plasma lipoproteins separated by sequential ultracentrifugation. Incorporation of [D3]L-leucine into apolipoproteins was monitored by negative ionization, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Production rates were determined by multiplying plasma apolipoprotein pool sizes by fractional production rates (calculated as the rate of isotopic enrichment [IE] of each protein as a fraction of IE achieved by VLDL (d less than 1.006 g/ml) apo B-100 at plateau. VLDL apo B-100 production was greater, and LDL (1.019 less than d less than 1.063 g/ml) apo B-100 production was less in the fed compared with the fasted state (9.9 +/- 1.7 vs. 6.4 +/- 1.7 mg/kg per d, P less than 0.01, and 8.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 13.1 +/- 1.2 mg/kg per d, P less than 0.05, respectively). No mean change was observed in high density lipoprotein apo A-I production. We conclude that: (a) this stable isotope, endogenous-labeling technique, for the first time allows for the in vivo measurement of apolipoprotein production in the fasted and fed state; and (b) since LDL apo B-100 production was greater than VLDL apo B-100 production in the fasted state, this study provides in vivo evidence that LDL apo B-100 can be produced independently of VLDL apo B-100 in normolipidemic subjects.\r"

This study identifies a tissue antigen detected by patient serum and then isolates the autoantibody using epidermis and protein bands blotted on nitrocellulose as immunoabsorbents. Sera from 10 patients (9 with cutaneous disease and 1 with cicatrizing conjunctivitis) were evaluated. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed an IgA anti-basement membrane antibody in 6 of 10 sera with monkey esophagus substrate and 9 of 10 sera with human epidermal substrate. Immunoblotting was performed on epidermal and dermal extracts prepared from skin separated at the basement membrane zone with either sodium chloride or EDTA. Saline-separated skin expressed a 97-kD band in dermal extract alone that was recognized by 4 of 10 sera. EDTA-separated skin expressed the 97-kD band in both epidermal (4 of 10 sera) and dermal (6 of 10 sera) extract. Immunoabsorption of positive sera with epidermis purified an IgA antibody that reacted uniquely with the 97-kD band. In addition, IgA antibody bound to nitrocellulose was eluted from the 97-kD band and found to uniquely bind basement membrane zone. It is likely that the 97-kD protein identified by these techniques is responsible for basement membrane binding of IgA in LABD.\r"

These two genetic loci, C4A and C4B, are highly homologous in primary structure but encode proteins with different functional activities. Expression of C4A and C4B genes is regulated by IFN-gamma in human hepatoma cells and in murine fibroblasts transformed with the respective genes. In these cell lines, IFN-gamma has a significantly greater and longer-lasting effect on expression of C4A than that of C4B. In this study we examined synthesis and regulation of C4A and C4B in peripheral blood monocytes from normal, C4A-null, and C4B-null individuals. Synthesis of C4 in human peripheral blood monocytes decreases during time in culture. IFN-gamma mediates a concentration- and time-dependent increase in steady-state levels of C4 mRNA and a corresponding increase in synthesis of C4 in normal human monocytes. LPS decreases monocyte C4 expression and completely abrogates the effect of IFN-gamma on the expression of this gene. In contrast, LPS and IFN-gamma have a synergistic effect in upregulating expression of another class III MHC gene product, complement protein factor B. The effect of LPS on constitutive and IFN-gamma-regulated C4 synthesis is probably not mediated via release of endogenous monokines IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, or IL-6. Synthesis of C4, and regulation of its synthesis by IFN-gamma and LPS, are similar in normal, C4A-, and C4B-null individuals. These results demonstrate the synthesis of C4 at extrahepatic sites and tissue-specific regulation of C4 gene expression.\r"

During beta 1-adrenergic blockade with 10 microM (-)-propranolol, cells preincubated with 1 microgram/ml pertussis toxin for 2-5 h exhibited a rapid twofold increase in ICa after rupture of the membrane patch when 5 mM ATP was present in the patch clamp pipette. In the absence of ATP, the increase in ICa did not occur. In pertussis toxin-treated cells, 100 microM (-)-phenylephrine inhibited the augmentation of ICa. This inhibitory effect was blocked by 100 nM terazosin, a selective alpha 1-antagonist. The inhibitory effect of alpha 1-adrenergic agonism was not mediated by cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase since incubation with 100 microM (-)-phenylephrine did not augment the activity of this enzyme. We conclude that regulation of the L-type calcium channel in cardiac cells is complex, and is dependent on a pertussis toxin-sensitive substrate, ATP, and an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor. The marked increase in ICa after pertussis toxin treatment in the presence of ATP indicates significant inhibition of ICa by a pertussis toxin substrate, presumably the guanine nucleotide inhibitory protein (Gi) in the basal state. The inhibitory action of (-)-phenylephrine in pertussis toxin-treated cells is consistent with modulation of ICa by an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor not coupled to Gi.\r"

Several studies, including TIMI IIA (2,3,10,22), have suggested that immediate catheterization and angioplasty offer no clinical benefit and have a greater complication rate than a more delayed invasive strategy, but TIMI II (1) and SWIFT (16) trials have suggested that an even more conservative strategy of reserving catheterization and coronary angioplasty after thrombolytic therapy for patients with recurrent spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia may be the most desirable approach for the majority of patients similar to those entered into these trials.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a weight-adjusted high dose (2 mg/kg body weight over 3 h) rapid infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was more efficacious than a weight-adjusted standard dose (1.25 mg/kg over 3 h) in achieving reperfusion in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, 175 patients were entered into a randomized multicenter trial. Eighty-four patients were entered into the high dose group, receiving 1.2 mg/kg (10% given as a bolus injection) over 1 h, followed by 0.8 mg/kg over the next 2 h. Ninety-one patients were given 0.75 mg/kg (10% given as a bolus injection) in 1 h, followed by 0.5 mg/kg administered over the next 2 h. The median dose in the group that received 2 mg/kg dose was 145 mg, compared with 100 mg in the group that received 1.25 mg/kg. The 90 min patency rate in the group that received 2 mg/kg was 84% compared with 70% in the group that received 1.25 mg/kg (p = 0.003). Sixty-four percent of the patients in each group underwent coronary angioplasty at the time of cardiac catheterization. The infarct-related artery patency rate at the end of catheterization was 91% in the group that received 2 mg/kg compared with 83% in the group that received 1.25 mg/kg (p = 0.08). Among patients with a patent infarct-related coronary artery after catheterization, the 6 month mortality rate in the group that received 2 mg/kg was 2.9% compared with 9.8% in the group that received 1.25 mg/kg (p = 0.15). The bleeding complication rate in the two groups was similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The growing recognition of the importance of early thrombolysis in evolving myocardial infarction was the basis for the present study, which evaluated the effectiveness, feasibility and safety of prehospital thrombolytic therapy. In a relatively small study, 118 patients were allocated to receive either prehospital treatment with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in the mobile intensive care unit (group A, 74 patients) or hospital treatment (group B, 44 patients). A total of 120 mg of rt-PA was infused over a period of 6 h. All patients were fully heparinized and underwent radionuclide left ventriculography and coronary angiography during hospitalization. Although group A was treated significantly earlier than group B after onset of symptoms (94 +/- 36 versus 137 +/- 45 min, respectively; p less than 0.001), no significant differences were observed between the groups in 1) extent of myocardial necrosis, 2) global left ventricular ejection fraction at discharge, 3) patency of infarct-related artery, 4) length of hospital stay, and 5) mortality at 60 days. However, a trend to a lower incidence of congestive heart failure at hospital discharge was observed in the prehospital-treated compared with the hospital-treated group (7% versus 16%, respectively; p = NS). No major complications occurred during transportation. It is concluded that myocardial infarction can be accurately diagnosed and thrombolytic therapy initiated relatively safely during the prehospital phase by the mobile intensive care team, thus instituting a beneficial clinical trend in favor of prehospital thrombolysis.\r"

The mean serum-elimination half-life of terfenadine metabolite I was 8.7 +/- 3.7 hours.

Significant flare suppression occurred from 2 to 24 hours, with maximum flare suppression, 75 +/- 15% to 78 +/- 13% from 4 to 8 hours. The mean serum-elimination half-life of chlorpheniramine was 22.6 +/- 11.0 hours.

Significant flare suppression occurred from 1 to 12 hours, with maximum flare suppression of 43 +/- 14% to 46 +/- 19% at 2, 5, and 6 hours (p less than 0.01). Adverse effects, chiefly sedation, occurred in five of eight patients after receiving terfenadine, and in all eight patients after receiving chlorpheniramine; but, since no placebo control was administered, these adverse effects could not be definitely attributed to H1-receptor-antagonist ingestion.\r"

Sixty ragweed-sensitive adults were randomized either to a course of four Pollinex-R hyposensitization injections during the 6 weeks before the ragweed-pollen season, or to budesonide aqueous nasal steroid spray, 400 micrograms daily, throughout the season. A double-dummy technique was used to achieve blinding. During the ragweed-pollen season, troublesome nasal symptoms were treated with terfenadine, 60 mg, when treatment was needed, up to 240 mg daily, and eye symptoms were treated with naphazoline eye drops, when treatment was needed, up to four times daily. Every day, subjects recorded the severity of nasal and eye symptoms and medication use in a diary. Fourteen of the subjects receiving Pollinex-R were unable to complete the course of injections because of systemic or large local reactions. Eight subjects withdrew during the pollen season because of severe rhinitis; all subjects had received Pollinex-R. Subjects in the budesonide-treated group had minimal nasal symptoms and used very little terfenadine, compared with subjects in the Pollinex-R-treated group (p less than 0.0001). Eye symptoms and eye drop use were similar in the two treatment groups. No clinically important side effects were reported by the subjects receiving budesonide. The results of this study suggest that aqueous budesonide nasal spray is markedly more effective than Pollinex-R in controlling symptoms of seasonal rhinitis while the side effects and inconvenience of immunotherapy are avoided.\r"

To produce sympathectomy, rats were injected with 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (6-OHDA; 2 x 50 mg/kg iv) on days 1 and 8; the animals were decapitated on day 15. The depletion of norepinephrine in the heart was about 86% in each age group. 125I-Iodopindolol (IPIN), a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, was employed to determine the affinity and total number of beta adrenergic receptors in the ventricles of the rat heart. The maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) was significantly elevated by 37%, 48%, and 50% in hearts from sympathectomized 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old rats, respectively.

Secondary analyses were conducted on data collected from clients at baseline, 9 months (N = 225), and 48 months (N = 76) after acceptance to community care and home-delivered meals programs. Analyses revealed a significant increase in the amount of formal services provided to both groups of clients at 9 months and to community care clients at 48 months. The increase was attributed to the large proportion of \"new\" or \"supplementary\" services provided by agencies. No significant decrease in the amount of service provided by informal caregivers was found. In addition, regression analyses demonstrated only a weak impact of formal service on informal care. Analysis of patterns of service provision for each client demonstrated that formal care supplemented rather than substituted for informal care significantly more often in both the 9- and 48-month samples. We conclude that formal care in general supplemented the efforts of informal caregivers, and that informal caregiving remained stable over time.\r"

  ".U": "90187839\r", 
  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that resting and previously activated B lymphocytes differ in their proliferative and differentiative responses to various Th cell-derived stimuli, we have examined the interactions of purified small (resting) and large (activated) murine B cells with rabbit Ig-specific Th1 and Th2 clones in the presence of the Ag analogue, rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody. Small numbers of Th2 cells induce strong Ag-dependent proliferation of and Ig secretion by both resting and activated B lymphocytes. In contrast, Th1 clones stimulate lower responses of activated B cells and fail to stimulate small resting B cells. An interaction with Th1 clones does make small B cells responsive to the Th2-derived cytokine, IL-4, indicating that Th1 clones are capable of delivering some but not all the stimuli necessary for the induction of humoral immunity. Finally, in order to compare the responses of small and large B cells to cognate interactions and secreted cytokines, we used an autoreactive I-Ak-specific Th2 line. This line induces proliferation of and Ig secretion by I-Ak expressing but not H-2d resting and activated B cells as a result of cognate interactions. However, when the H-2d B cells are bystanders in the presence of cytokine secretion by this Th2 line, or are directly exposed to Th2-derived cytokines, both small and large B cells are induced to proliferate but only the large B cells secrete antibody. These results indicate that the magnitude and nature of antibody responses depend on three principal factors: the cytokines produced by Th cells, the state of activation of the responding B lymphocytes, and whether the B cells are recipients of cognate help or are bystanders at the site of T cell stimulation. Our findings also confirm the view that cognate T-B interactions are most efficient for initiating B cell responses and may allow B cells to subsequently respond to a variety of T cell-derived cytokines.\r"

Me14/D12 is a nondisulfide-linked heterodimeric structure containing two polypeptide chains of 33,000 and 38,000 Da. The expression of Me14/D12 on resting T lymphocytes can be induced by different activation stimuli such as the lectins PHA and Con A, the phorbol ester PMA, and anti-CD3 mAb. The induction of mRNA for Me14/D12 (gp33-38) in PHA-activated T lymphocytes precedes that of IL-2R gene transcripts by more than 20 h. Me14/D12 mRNA was detectable as early as 2 h after the onset of activation and mRNA for the IL-2R only after 24 h. The surface expression of Me14/D12 was detectable between 12 and 24 h after activation and was maximal between 24 and 48 h. Several T leukemia cell lines express the Me14/D12 Ag. On Me14/D12- cell lines, PMA and IFN-gamma induced surface expression of Me14/D12. Once Me14/D12 Ag were expressed on Jurkat cells after stimulation with either PMA or IFN-gamma, the binding of mAb Me14/D12 induced the production of significant amounts of IL-2 and of Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores. Comparative biochemical studies clearly demonstrate that Me14/D12 (gp33-38) is different from the CD69 molecular complex defined by mAb MLR3 and AIM.\r"

  ".W": "Th1 and Th2 clones specific for human gamma globulin (HGG) were compared and shown to differ in terms of the effects of tolerance induction on Ag-induced proliferation and helper activity. In developing a method to induce tolerance, splenic APC that had been pulsed with HGG and then fixed with 0.15% paraformaldehyde (HGG-FAPC) were used as a means to present Ag to the Th clones in the absence of costimulatory signals. Both Th1 and Th2 clones recognized HGG-FAPC as evidenced by their ability to proliferate to HGG-FAPC. Unlike Th2, Th1 proliferated to HGG-FAPC only in the presence of T cell-depleted allogeneic spleen cells as a source of accessory cell signals. The inability of Th1 cells to proliferate in the absence of costimulatory signals was due to Ag-specific inactivation: Th1 clones preincubated with HGG-FAPC were unable to proliferate when recultured with HGG and irradiated APC. In contrast to Th1 clones, Th2 clones showed no decrease in their Ag-induced proliferative capacity after exposure to any concentration of HGG-FAPC. However, when examined by using a second assay system, that of providing help for anti-HGG antibody production by primed B cells, Th2 preincubated with HGG-FAPC were markedly inhibited (up to 90%) in their ability to provide help. Preincubation with HGG-FAPC also inhibited the helper activity of the one Th1 clone that was found to induce a significant secondary antibody response. Taken together, the results suggest that exposure of Th1 to tolerogen in the form of HGG-pulsed fixed APC inactivates Th1 proliferative capacity, and possibly Th1 helper activity as well. Exposure of Th2 cells to a tolerogen suppresses the mechanism by which the Th2 cells provide Ag-induced B cell help, but does not inhibit the mechanism by which they proliferate to HGG. Furthermore, the results define a model that incorporates Ag processing as well as Ag presentation in the induction of tolerance in vitro.\r"

Because IL-1 has been previously implicated in thymocyte proliferation, we examined the effects of IL-1 on precursor thymocytes, the CD4-CD8- or double-negative (DN) cells. We show that IL-1 (together with Con A) is a growth factor for DN, TCR- alpha beta-cells in vitro. After 5 days of culture in IL-1 and Con A, a number of phenotypic changes were observed and two subsets of DN cells were distinguished. One subset expressed full length TCR-alpha and -beta mRNA and surface alpha beta TCR, the other expressed low levels of full length TCR-gamma together with high levels of full length TCR-delta mRNA. Thus, DN cells are induced by IL-1 and Con A to proliferate and express TCR without parallel acquisition of CD4 or CD8 markers. These data suggest that IL-1 drives early steps of intrathymic T cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporine A (CsA) inhibits T lymphocyte activation in vitro by blocking at a pretranslational level the production of IL-2 and other cytokines. It is widely assumed that the effectiveness of CsA as an immunosuppressive drug is secondary to a similar mechanism of action in vivo. We have previously demonstrated that certain parameters of T cell activation in the draining popliteal lymph node in response to the injection of alloantigen in the footpad were either completely resistant or enhanced by the administration of CsA. In the present study, we have shown that the mechanism of action of CsA in vivo is identical to that seen in vitro as CsA completely suppressed the induction of IL-2 mRNA as detected in a nuclease protection assay in lymph node cells from alloantigen-primed animals. Nevertheless, T cells from CsA-treated animals appeared to have undergone both priming and differentiation. Thus, upon culture in vitro in the presence of CsA, cells from CsA-treated animals manifested a vigorous proliferative response that could not be inhibited by the addition of a large panel of anti-cytokine mAb. Furthermore, cells from CsA-treated animals demonstrated an enhanced secondary response to the priming alloantigen, which suggests that they had undergone clonal expansion in vivo. Although CTL activity was markedly suppressed in cells from CsA-treated animals, after a 36-h culture in the absence of CsA, CTL activity equivalent to that detected in cells from nontreated animals was present. Collectively, these data support the existence of an alternative IL-2-independent, CsA-resistant pathway of T cell activation/differentiation that may play a prominent role in the generation of certain T effector functions in vivo.\r"

Approximately half of the LPS-responsive cells produced IgA.

  ".U": "90187853\r", 
  ".W": "The first step in the migration of lymphocytes out of the blood is adherence of lymphocytes to endothelial cells (EC) in the postcapillary venule. It is thought that in inflammatory reactions cytokines activate the endothelium to promote lymphocyte adherence and migration into the inflammatory site. Injection of IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha/beta, and TNF-alpha into the skin of rats stimulated the migration of small peritoneal exudate lymphocytes (sPEL) into the injection site, and these cytokines mediated lymphocyte recruitment to delayed-type hypersensitivity, sites of virus injection, and in part to LPS. The effect of cytokines on lymphocyte adherence to rat microvascular EC was examined. IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha/beta, IL-1, TNF-alpha, and TNF-beta increased the binding of small peritoneal exudate lymphocyte (sPEL) to EC. IFN-gamma was more effective and stimulated adherence at much lower concentrations than the other cytokines. IL-2 did not increase lymphocyte adherence. LPS strongly stimulated lymphocyte binding. Treatment of EC, but not sPEL, enhanced adhesion, and 24 h of treatment with IFN-gamma and IL-1 induced near maximal adhesion. Lymph node lymphocytes, which migrate poorly to inflammatory sites, adhered poorly to unstimulated and stimulated EC, whereas sPEL demonstrated significant spontaneous adhesion which was markedly increased by IFN-gamma, IL-1, and LPS. Spleen lymphocytes showed an intermediate pattern of adherence. Combinations of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were additive in stimulating sPEL-EC adhesion. Depletion of sPEL and spleen T cells by adherence to IFN-gamma stimulated EC decreased the in vivo migration of the lymphocytes to skin sites injected with IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha/beta, TNF-alpha, poly I:C, LPS, and to delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions by 50%, and significantly increased the migration of these cells to normal lymph nodes, as compared to unfractionated lymphocytes. Thus the cytokines and lymphocytes involved in migration to cutaneous inflammation in the rat stimulate lymphocyte adhesion to rat EC in vitro, and IFN-gamma stimulated EC appear to promote the selective adhesion of inflammatory site-seeking lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Intrathymic tolerance results in elimination of T cells bearing self-reactive TCR V beta regions in mice expressing certain combinations of I-E and minor lymphocyte stimulatory (Mls) phenotypes. To determine if autoimmune strains of mice have a defect in intrathymic deletion of self-reactive TCR V beta regions, expression of V beta 3, V beta 6, V beta 8.1, and V beta 11 were examined in lpr/lpr and +/+ strains of mice; MRL/MpJ(H-2K, I-E+, Mlsb,), C57BL/6J(H-2b, I-E-, Mlsb,), C3H/HeJ(H-2k, I-E+, Mlsc), AKR/J(H-2k, I-E+, Mlsa); and in autoimmune NZB/N(H-2d, I-E+, Mlsa) and BXSB(H-2b, I-E-, Mlsb) mice. The results suggest that, during intrathymic development, self-reactive T cells are deleted in autoimmune strains of mice as found in normal control strains of mice. However, the TCR V beta repertoire is skewed in autoimmune strains compared to normal strains of mice. For example, MRL-lpr/lpr mice, but not other lpr/lpr strains, had increased expression of V beta 6 relative to expression in control MRL(-)+/+ mice, which is associated with collagen-induced arthritis. These data are consistent with a model of normal affinity for negative selection of self-reactive T cells in the thymus of autoimmune strains of mice followed by expansion of autoreactive T cell clones in the peripheral lymphoid organs. The peripheral lymphoid organs of lpr/lpr mice contain an expanded population of abnormal CD4-, CD8-, 6B2+ T cells. Elimination of self-reactive peripheral T cells suggests that these abnormal cells are derived from a CD4+ subpopulation in the thymus. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral lymph node T cells from MRL-lpr/lpr mice reveal three populations of CD4+ T cells expressing low, intermediate and high intensity of B220 (6B2). This supports the hypothesis that in lpr/lpr mice, self-reactive CD4+ T cells are eliminated in the thymus, and that these cells lose expression of CD4 and acquire expression of 6B2 in the periphery.\r"

We show that Ly-6A/E proteins also modulated the response of normal B lymphocytes in three separate in vitro assays. First, unfractionated or small resting B cells proliferated when cultured with IFN-gamma, IL-4, and an anti-Ly-6A/E mAb. Second, this anti-Ly-6A/E mAb restored B cell proliferation responses that were inhibited when coculturing the B cells in IFN-gamma, IL-4, and anti-IgM. Third, anti-Ly-6A/E specifically up-regulated the cell surface expression of its own Ag, and this response was dependent upon co-stimulation with IFN-gamma. Mixing of T and B cells in culture suggested that T cells did not contribute substantially to the B cell proliferative response. Moreover, up-regulation of Ly-6A/E was observed for one B cell lymphoma, WEHI-231. Therefore, it appeared that modulation of B cell function by anti-Ly-6A/E was due to a direct effect of the mAb binding to the B cells. Taken together, these data suggest Ly-6A/E proteins are functional on B cells and may play a regulatory role in B cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that IL-4 can affect lymphocyte responses to IL-2. To evaluate the effects of IL-4 on T cell responses to physiologically relevant stimuli, we studied normal human T cells cultured with a low concentration of anti-CD3 mAb and IL-2 in the presence and absence of added IL-4. The addition of IL-4 to cultures of T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb and IL-2 reduced the proliferative response by 49 to 59%. The inhibitory effect was observed in 3-, 5-, and 7-day cultures. Inhibition was dose-dependent with maximal inhibition at concentrations greater than or equal to 5 to 10 U/ml IL-4. IL-4-mediated inhibition occurred early during the T cell response, inasmuch as addition of IL-4 after stimulation for 24 h did not result in significant inhibition. Phenotypic analyses of cells cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb, IL-2, and IL-4 suggested that the mechanism of regulation by IL-4 involves the inhibition of IL-2R expression. The proportion of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells that expressed IL-2R in response to IL-2 was diminished in the presence of IL-4, although HLA-DR levels were unaffected. Soluble IL-2R was also reduced in supernatants of cultures stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb, IL-2, and IL-4 as compared to cultures stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb and IL-2. These findings indicate that when normal human T cells are stimulated in vitro in a manner that approximates a physiologic interaction with Ag in vivo, rIL-4 provides a potent inhibitory signal to IL-2 responsive cells that is likely mediated by IL-4-induced inhibition of IL-2R expression.\r"

IL-1-induced IL-1 may be part of a self-amplification or an autocrine growth factor in a variety of responses, and thus the endogenous regulation of IL-1 production likely contributes to the outcome of immunologic or inflammatory responses. In the present study, IFN-gamma consistently increased LPS-induced IL-1, but reduced the total amount of IL-1-induced IL-1 from PBMC. This reduction was observed in populations of adherent cells and cells selected with anti-Leu M3 antibody. On a molar basis, IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha 2 were equally effective in reducing IL-1-induced IL-1 synthesis. In PBMC of 24 human subjects, IFN-gamma also reduced PMA-induced IL-1 synthesis (67% decrease, p less than 0.001). The augmentation of LPS-stimulated IL-1 by IFN-gamma was observed only when added at the same time as LPS, but IFN-gamma could be added 6 h after stimulation with IL-1 and still suppress IL-1 production. LPS-induced mRNA for IL-1 beta was modestly enhanced by IFN-gamma whereas mRNA levels for TNF were markedly increased. In contrast, IFN-gamma suppressed mRNA accumulation for IL-beta after stimulation with IL-1 alpha by 60 to 95%. The addition of IFN-gamma 30 min before stimulation of PBMC with IL-1 suppressed IL-1 beta mRNA for up to 30 h. The half-life of IL-1 beta mRNA of approximately 2 h was not influenced by IFN-gamma. Thus, IFN-gamma reduces IL-1-induced IL-1 synthesis by suppressing IL-1-induced transcription, whereas the same concentrations of IFN-gamma augment LPS-induced IL-1 production by increasing transcription.\r"

In addition, using permeabilized lymphoma cells, we have found that: 1) GTP or GTP-tau-S augments, and pertussis toxin inhibits, phospholipase C (PLC) activity and receptor capping; and 2) the addition of lymphoma 41-kDa Gi alpha-like protein stimulates PLC activity and receptor patching/capping, and reverses the inhibitory effect of pertussis toxin on both activity and receptor patching/capping. Additional cytochemical and biochemical data indicate that the lymphoma 41-kDa protein is closely associated with several cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., actin, myosin, and fodrin) all of which colocalize under receptor cap structures. Furthermore, both the 41-kDa-mediated phospholipase C activity and receptor patching/capping are inhibited by cytochalasin D (a microfilament disrupting drug) and W-7 drug (a calmodulin inhibitor). Together, these data provide strong evidence for a functional association between the lymphoma membrane cytoskeleton and the 41-kDa (Gi alpha-like) protein. Specifically, this association appears to be required for the activation of phospholipase C that results in inositol triphosphate production, subsequent internal Ca2+ release, and finally surface receptor patching and capping.\r"

Preexposure of mouse inflammatory peritoneal macrophages to either DHP (0.5 to 2.5 mM) or 2,2'-dipyridyl (0.1 to 0.3 mM) for 24 h produced a dose-related suppression of their response to activation by lipid A to mediate tumor cytotoxicity of L1210 mouse leukemia targets. Inhibition of C1q secretion by DHP-treated macrophages was confirmed both by a complement hemolytic assay and by autoradiographic analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled culture supernatants. DHP-treated macrophages were inhibited in their response to direct activation and triggering of IFN-gamma-primed macrophages by lipid A, Poly I:C, and cobra venom factor for tumor cytotoxicity. DHP inhibited macrophage activation for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of L1210 tumor targets mediated by antitumor target IgG. The addition of exogenous purified C1q (2 micrograms/ml) to macrophages after DHP treatment, reconstituted their response to activation for both antibody-independent and antibody-dependent tumor cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that C1q synthesis and secretion by effector macrophages is a prerequisite for the initiation of their activation by both immune complex and by non-antibody agents that also bind C1q. It now appears that macrophage-derived C1q may act as an auxiliary amplification signal for autocrine-like modulation of the initiation of macrophage activation by both the antibody-dependent and independent pathways.\r"

  ".W": "To further study the mechanisms by which surface Ig triggering activates the inositol phospholipid signaling pathway, we have used B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients which, as previously described, display two patterns of response upon sIg cross-linking: in one group this cross-linking induces an inositol phosphate release, an intracellular free Ca2+ concentration elevation and a subsequent cell proliferation; in a second group none of these events occur although there is an increased class II Ag expression following anti-mu stimulation as in the first group. We have been able to demonstrate that the phosphatidyl inositol specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) can be activated in permeabilized B cells from the first group by direct stimulation, with GPT gamma S, of a guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein. In addition, since anti-mu + GTP gamma S stimulate an increased inositol phosphate production in these cells, this suggests that surface Ig cross-linking activates PI-PLC via a G protein. However, in cells from the second group no inositol phosphate is released after GTP gamma S stimulation although PI-PLC can be directly activated by high Ca2+ concentrations. This reflects in these cells, an interruption of the signaling cascade sIg/G protein/PI-PLC at the level of the G protein or at the G protein/PI-PLC coupling. In cells from both groups PMA treatment, which is known to alter phosphatidyl inositol metabolism in B cells, completely inhibits PI-PLC activation even by high Ca2+ concentrations. These studies show that the phosphatidyl inositol-dependent signaling cascade after surface Ig triggering can be altered at different levels in B cells.\r"

  ".U": "90187882\r", 
  ".W": "In previous studies we demonstrated the triggering of the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway during the activation of an Ag-specific human CD4+ T lymphocyte clone by a mitogenic pair of CD2 (X11,D66) mAb. Similar conditions were applied to investigate a possible involvement of a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) acting as an additional alternative pathway during human T cell activation. Our results show that arachidonic acid or its derivatives are released after CD2 triggering. This release is largely independent of PLC activation and is mediated by a PLA2 because: 1) phosphatidylcholine is the preferential source of [3H]arachidonate release; 2) [3H]arachidonic acid release and phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis are blocked by two inhibitors of solubilized PLA2, mepacrine, and 4-p-bromophenacylbromide; and 3) we evidenced a PLA2 activity in cell homogenates. Extracellular calcium appears to play a critical role because the effects of CD2 mAb were inhibited in a Ca2(+)-depleted medium. In contrast, protein kinase C is not implicated since PMA, a protein kinase C activator, neither stimulated arachidonic acid release nor modulated CD2-induced arachidonic acid release. Cyclic AMP which has been proved to regulate the activity of the PLC in T lymphocytes does not appear to play an important role in the regulation of PLA2 activity since PGE2 has only a minimal effect on [3H]-arachidonate release. Altogether, these findings suggest that CD2 triggering stimulates a PLA2 activity in T lymphocytes via an extracellular Ca2(+)-dependent PLC protein kinase C independent mechanism.\r"

A large number of CD8+ T cell clones were obtained either by passaging of bulk cultures at limiting dilutions or by direct cloning of PBMC without previous stimulation in bulk culture. The MV-specific CD8+ T cell clones responding in a proliferative and a CTL assay were found to be class I MHC restricted. In contrast, CD4+ MV-specific T cell clones, which were generated by the same protocol, recognized MV in association with class II MHC molecules. Analysis of processing requirements for Ag presentation to CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clones, measured by the effect of chloroquine in a proliferative T cell response, revealed that both types of T cells recognized MV Ag processed via the endogenous/cytoplasmic pathway. Thus, these studies indicate that, as in most other viral infections and in contrast to previous suggestions, the class I MHC-restricted CTL response by CD8+ T cells may be an important factor in the control and elimination of MV infection. Therefore, the role proposed for CD4+ class II-restricted T cells in recovery from measles needs to be reevaluated.\r"

  ".W": "Presence of the three major pathways (self-Ia restricted, allo-K/D restricted, and allo-Ia restricted pathways) in generating class I-restricted CTL has been reported. The present study was conducted in order to clarify which of the three is the main pathway in mediating tumor allograft rejection. One million EL-4 tumor cells derived from C57BL/6 (B6;H-2b) were inoculated into the various strains of mice that were genetically different from B6. Class I (K/D) Ag-disparate but IA Ag-matched B6.C-H-2bm1 (bm1;Kbm1, IAb, IE-, Db) mice or B10.A (5R) (5R; b, b, k, d) mice could not reject 1 x 10(6) EL-4 tumor cells in spite of the strong generation of CTL against the B6 Ag, suggesting the inability of the self-Ia restricted pathway and the allo-K/D restricted pathway in rejecting tumor allografts. The strains of mice being capable of rejecting EL-4 tumor were disparate from B6 mice in both class I and class II (IA) Ag, suggesting the importance of the allo-Ia restricted pathway in rejecting tumor allografts. To generate CTL against Kb Ag via the allo-Ia restricted pathway in the bm1 mice, 2 x 10(7) B6.H-2bm12 (bm12; b, bm12, -, b) spleen cells were injected into the bm1 mice as a supplementary source of allogeneic APC that possibly raise CTL through CD4+ Th cells of bm1 origin. These bm1 mice became capable of rejecting 1 x 10(6) EL-4 tumor cells. The same was observed in the combination of bm12----B10.A (5R) (b, b, k, d) mice. To further elucidate the role of the class II restricted CD4+ Th cells, anti-CD4 antibody was repeatedly i.v. administered into the C3H/He (C3H; H-2k) or the DBA/2 (DBA; H-2d) mice on days 0, 1, and 4. Injection of anti-CD4 antibody led 1 x 10(6) EL-4 tumor cells to grow and kill the C3H and DBA mice. These results suggest that the main effector CTL pathway involved in tumor allograft rejection is allo-Ia restricted pathway where CD8+ precursor CTL were stimulated by the class II-restricted CD4+ Th cells.\r"

In normal tissues that have been studied to date, c-fos expression has been found to be regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Actually, little is known about its expression in normal human adult skin (NHAS). Moreover, the epidermis is a useful tissue to study the role of cellular oncogenes because keratinocytes can be observed simultaneously in their proliferative as well as differentiated state. We studied c-fos expression in NHAS using different molecular approaches which permit us to characterize and localize c-fos products within the epidermis, specifically, at the RNA level by Northern blot and in situ hybridization, and at the protein level by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Here, we show that both c-fos mRNA and protein are present at high levels in NHAS. These results contrast with the low level of c-fos expression reported for most human adult tissues. Furthermore, c-fos expression is visible throughout the epidermal layers indicating that it is not restricted to proliferating basal cells. The epidermis, therefore, represents the first human adult tissue where c-fos is expressed at high levels in vivo and provides an interesting model to further elucidate the role of this proto-oncogene in normal and pathologic conditions.\r"

The activities of two enzymes in the melanogenesis pathway, tyrosinase and dopachrome conversion factor, are increased as part of the induction process. Trans retinoic acid (RA), at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM, inhibited the induction of tyrosinase, dopachrome conversion factor, and melanogenesis, but had no effect on the basal levels of either enzyme or of cellular melanin content. Half-maximal effects of RA occurred at a concentration of 10 nM; maximal effects were observed at 1 microM. The effects of RA on melanogenesis were independent of its effects on cellular growth since one Cloudman line tested was growth-inhibited by RA and another was growth-stimulated by RA, but the induction of melanogenesis by MSH in both lines was inhibited by RA. Mixing experiments with cell lysates failed to demonstrate the induction of a tyrosinase inhibitor by RA. The effects of RA were not limited to MSH or to Cloudman melanoma cells since RA blocked cholera toxin-inducible melanogenesis in Cloudman cells, as well as the induction of tyrosinase activity by L-tyrosine in Bomirski hamster melanoma cells. The effects of RA were specific to melanogenesis, however, since RA did not interfere with MSH-induced changes in cellular morphology and growth. Thus, RA appears to be a new and potent tool for understanding mechanisms regulating induction of the pigmentary system.\r"

The H-2 complex was found to play a major role in determining the pattern of responsiveness, whereas the effect of the Igh locus on the response was not apparent. The H-2k haplotype was closely associated with low responders, whereas mice with the H-2b,d alleles were high responders. The responsiveness of the H-2k strains was converted from low to high levels by treatment with cyclophosphamide (CY) before photosensitization. Transfer of spleen cells from photosensitized H-2k mice showed a suppressive effect on the development of the CPS reaction of syngeneic recipients pretreated with CY. These spleen cells contained antigen-specific CD4+, CD8- suppressor T cells (Ts) that functioned in the induction phase of CPS. The in vitro proliferation of immune lymph node T cells pulsed with photohapten-coupled cells plus peritoneal adherent cells was suppressed by the addition of anti-I-A monoclonal antibody in both H-2d and H-2k strains, suggesting that the I-A molecule are responsible for inducing the positive immune response. On the other hand, such proliferation was significantly enhanced by the addition of anti-I-E alpha antibody in H-2k, but not H-2d, mice. This implies that the low responsiveness of CPS in the H-2k strain is due to the preferential activation of Ts via I-Ek molecules. The present observation further supports the important role of the I-E molecule in the suppressor circuit of CPS to TCSA.\r"

Plasma levels of neopterin were elevated in measles (32.5 +/- 2.7) compared with healthy adults (5.3 +/- 2.9, P less than .0001), healthy children (12.1 +/- 4.0, P less than .001), and children with other infectious diseases (20.6 +/- 4.0, P less than .02). IFN-gamma was increased in measles primarily during rash; neopterin remained elevated for several weeks. Levels of neopterin showed a significant positive correlation with plasma levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor and soluble CD8, two other parameters of T cell activation. Children with measles complicated by pneumonia had higher levels of neopterin in serum than those with uncomplicated disease. Children with measles complicated by autoimmune encephalomyelitis had higher levels of neopterin in CSF than those with noninflammatory neurologic disease but lower than those with central nervous system infections. Thus, IFN-gamma seems to be produced in vivo during acute measles virus infection; deficiency of this lymphokine does not appear to correlate with increased susceptibility to secondary infections.\r"

These results are consistent with the operation of a comparatively primitive molecular mechanism for the initiation of scrapie agent replication (perhaps an inorganic crystal nucleation step) and the subsequent participation of an organic macromolecule (scrapie amyloid protein) that is susceptible to intramolecular cross-stabilization by formaldehyde.\r"

A pil- mutant PAK/NP, constructed by gene replacement, demonstrated low levels of attachment (3.8% of the inoculum adherent compared with 7% for the wild-type strain PAK), suggesting that other adhesins are functional. The Pil-, flagellum-negative strain PAO1150.1 bound the least (0.3% of the inoculum adherent), confirming the importance of motility in the binding process. The pilin sequences of strains P1 and PA1244 were virtually identical, although P1 bound threefold more than did PA1244. P1 produced 10-fold more proteinase than did PA1244, and a proteinase-negative mutant of P1, isolated by transposon mutagenesis, had binding equivalent to that of PA1244. The adherence of PAO1 was increased 60% in the presence of bacterial supernatants from phosphate-limited cultures and correlated with phospholipase C activity in the supernatant. Thus, the expression of several Pseudomonas genes may be required to promote efficient binding to epithelial surfaces.\r"

Incubation of radiolabeled CRP with serum samples from 22 patients with active inflammatory diseases and high levels of circulating immune complexes disclosed no difference in the amount of PEG-precipitable CRP when compared with serum samples from healthy individuals. However, a radiolabeled commercial preparation of CRP did result in some PEG-precipitable radioactivity after incubation with aggregated IgG. These findings provide no support for a biologically important binding interaction of CRP with immunoglobulin or immune complexes, and they suggest that highly purified preparations of CRP should be used in functional studies of this acute-phase protein.\r"

It also functions as a conduit for removal of secretions from the middle ear and mastoid air cell system into the post nasal space. Eustachian tube function may be assessed objectively using tympanometric measurements. (Brooks, 1968, Lutman, 1987). The post-operative use of nasogastric Ryles tubes is associated with reduced peak middle ear pressure (mmH2O) and reduced peak compliance volumes (ml) as assessed by tympanometry. In addition changes in the appearance of the tympanic membrane may occur with the protracted use of Ryles tubes. This phenomenon is a transient one. Nasogastric tube-induced Eustachian tube dysfunction is a previously unreported entity.\r"

  ".W": "A possible role of the proopiomelanocortin derived peptide gamma 2-melanocyte stimulating hormone (gamma 2-MSH) has been studied in patients with various degrees of congestive heart failure (CHF). The profile of changes in circulating levels of gamma 2-MSH-like immunoreactivity (-LI) has been compared with those of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-LI, arginine vasopressin (AVP)-LI and catecholamines in CHF. Patients with moderate CHF (New York Heart Association stages I-II) showed significantly higher levels of h-alpha ANP-LI and NA (P less than 0.05) compared to controls. Patients with severe CHF (stages III-IV) had significantly higher levels of all hormones measured compared to controls: noradrenaline, P less than 0.001; adrenaline, P less than 0.001; gamma 2-MSH-LI, P less than 0.001; h-alpha ANP-LI, P less than 0.05; AVP-LI, P less than 0.01. For the catecholamines and gamma 2-MSH-LI there was a significant increase from moderate to severe forms of CHF. A significant correlation was observed between gamma 2-MSH-LI and noradrenaline, and between h-alpha ANP-LI and noradrenaline in patients with CHF. The present results show that gamma 2-MSH-LI is increased only in severe forms of cardiac failure, and that this change is more closely related to the increase in circulating levels of noradrenaline than to increased levels of ANP-LI or AVP-LI.\r"

  ".W": "The present paper analyses the epidemiologic effects of mass breast cancer screening. Mass mammography may possibly achieve a breast cancer mortality reduction in relative risk terms. However, this does not necessarily represent a net benefit. It is argued that the benefits and adverse effects of a screening programme must be measured in terms of absolute risks. According to this measure, the mortality reduction achieved by a mass breast screening programme is only one death per approx. 15,000 women-years. Many thousands of mammograms are needed to prevent one cancer death, and for each woman who can derive a direct benefit in terms of a prevented breast cancer death, hundreds of women have to suffer the anxiety of a positive screening mammography. Moreover, it is possible that adverse effects of breast cancer screening may contribute to mortality from other causes. Even with the assumption that screening can save lives, the net health effect of mass breast cancer screening is questionable and appears to be rather detrimental. It may be an error to recommend mass breast screening.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnostic value of 111In-antimyosin (AM) imaging for identifying myocardial infarction was evaluated in comparison with 99mTc-pyrophosphate (PPi) imaging. Twenty-four patients with various stages of myocardial infarction, ranging from three days to nine months after the onset of infarction, underwent both AM and PPi scans. Of 26 infarct lesions AM scan identified 22 (85%), while PPi scans detected 10 (38%) (p less than 0.01). When less than a week had passed since the onset both scans demonstrated all infarct lesions. For seven subacute lesions studied within one to two weeks of onset, AM scans detected (100%), while PPi scans identified only 2 (29%). Furthermore, AM scans showed discrete myocardial uptake in 7 (64%) of those studied more than two weeks after onset. The intensity of AM uptake in the infarcts studied more than seven days after onset was less than that in acute infarcts studied within seven days of onset (p less than 0.05). These preliminary data indicate that the abnormal myocardial uptake of AM persists beyond the first two weeks when PPi no longer accumulates. Thus, AM scans can be considered to provide a sensitive diagnosis of subacute as well as acute myocardial necrosis.\r"

  ".W": "A series of human and animal experiments were carried out to assess the usefulness of equilibrium blood pool scintigraphy (EBPS) to study acute changes of the splanchnic vascular capacity and the splanchnic vascular pressure-volume (P-V) relationship. Corrected regional abdominal count rate changes, before and after various pharmacologic interventions, were used to assess regional splanchnic vascular volume changes. Animals were instrumented to manipulate and record splanchnic venous pressures. In patients, splanchnic vascular capacity increased by 5.2 +/- 6.9% (p less than 0.001) after 0.6 mg sublingual nitroglycerin while no significant change was noted after sugar pills (0.9 +/- 5.2%, p greater than 0.3). In dogs, splanchnic vascular capacity decreased by a mean of 16% during infusion of angiotensin (p less than 0.001) and increased by a mean of 32% during infusion of nitroprusside (p less than 0.001). The splanchnic vascular P-V curve was shifted rightwards during nitroglycerin administration. Thus, using the radionuclide technique we detected the expected qualitative and quantitative shifts in splanchnic capacity and capacitance. We conclude that EBPS is a useful method to assess acute changes of 1) the splanchnic vascular P-V relationship, in invasive animal studies, and 2) the splanchnic vascular capacity in noninvasive human and animal studies.\r"

Scintigraphic approaches with labeled antibodies to or components of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems have been disappointing because of prolonged circulating half-lives of tracers and relatively slow or limited binding to thrombi. Accordingly, we developed and characterized a thrombolytically inactive, active-site mutant (Ser-478----Thr) of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) designed to detect thrombi in vivo. Binding of iodine-125-(125I) labeled Ser----Thr t-PA to thrombi in vitro was time- and concentration-dependent, and specific judging from inhibition by pre-incubation with anti-t-PA IgG. Clearance of 125I-labeled mutant t-PA in rabbits was rapid and biexponential (alpha t1/2 = 1.9 +/- 0.4 min, beta t1/2 = 39.8 +/- 11.2 min). Thus, the amidolytically inactive mutant of t-PA designed binds rapidly and specifically to human thrombi in vitro and is cleared rapidly from the circulation in vivo--properties rendering it attractive as a potentially useful clot imaging agent.\r"

The loss of indium-111 (111In) from the chelate can pose problems in imaging and increases the radiation dose to normal tissues. We have evaluated the loss in vivo of 111In from Lym-1-benzyl-EDTA-111In (an antibody conjugated with isothiocyanato-benzyl-EDTA) in normal mice. A monoclonal antibody (CHA 255) that binds to benzyl-EDTA-indium chelates, but not to other forms of indium, was used to measure the percent of 111In remaining in the chelate. Four days after injection, 97.4 +/- 2.2% of the 111In in the liver was still in the benzyl-EDTA chelate, as was 99.4 +/- 0.7% of the 111In in the urine, and 99.1 +/- 0.7% of the 111In in the blood. Studies in vitro indicate that a benzyl-EDTA-111In-antibody-chelate conjugate is more stable in human serum than a benzyl-DTPA-111In conjugate, and that both benzyl-chelate conjugates are much more stable than an unsubstituted DTPA conjugate.\r"

As the OM concentration of the casein-based diet was increased from 0.02% to 0.6%, maximum weight gain was attained at 0.2%, and the growth-promoting activity of OM was comparable to Met at all the corresponding levels tested. Liver fat began to accumulate when supplemental Met reached a level of 0.08% of the casein diet, but OM addition did not produce a fatty liver at dietary levels of less than 0.3%. When SPI was used as the dietary protein source, the effect of supplemental OM was significantly less than that of Met. Digestibility of OM (assessed by incremental portal plasma Met concentration) was measured 30 min after feeding the casein or SPI diet supplemented with 3% OM using rats fasted for 24 h. Plasma Met concentration was greatly increased in rats fed the casein plus OM diet compared with that of rats fed the SPI + OM diet. Similarly, the 30-min portal Met concentration significantly increased in response to the casein + OM diet compared with the SPI + OM diet regardless of the prefed proteins (25% casein and 25% SPI for 2 wk).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: Cohort study utilizing prospective evaluation by residents, retrospective chart review, and direct communication with the patient, a family member, or the patient's physician one year after admission to the hospital. SETTING: The medical inpatient service of an urban university hospital. PATIENTS: The 580 patients admitted to the medical service during one month in 1984 for whom complete data were available. MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of the patients had consultations. Seventy percent (198/284) of the patients admitted by generalists had consultations, while 57% (170/296) of the patients admitted by subspecialists had consultations. Of the 1,422 major diagnostic tests performed on these patients, 504 (35%) were first recommended by consultants, and the consultants recommended cancellation of only ten major diagnostic tests. Patients who were seen by consultants had a length of stay that was more than double that of patients not seen by consultants. Consultation was associated with prolonged stay when patients were stratified by important clinical variables and remained an important independent factor in a multivariate model. The prolongation of hospitalization was principally due to delays in scheduling and interpreting sophisticated tests recommended by the consultants. When stratified into prognostically similar clinical groupings, there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between patients seen and those not seen by a consultant. CONCLUSION: Efforts to foster diagnostic restraint in the management of hospitalized patients should be broadened to include attention to the specialty consultation process.\r"

As measured variously by each of indirect immunofluorescence for detection of viral p17, antigen capture assay for the presence of viral p24 in culture fluids, and levels of viral reverse transcriptase activity in culture fluids, infection of thymic lymphocytes could be detected as early as 2 days after infection by HIV-1, and persisted through at least 14 days of tissue culture maintenance. These findings suggest that thymic lymphocytes may be susceptible to infection by HIV-1 in vivo, and may also be relevant to our understanding of HIV-1-induced pathogenesis, particularly in pediatric populations.\r"

The increase in [3H]inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate is rapid but transient after fMLP stimulation, whereas MTX-induced increase in [3H]inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate occurs at a slower rate and is sustained over time. In both cases increases in [Ca++]i, measured with fura-2, parallel the formation of inositol trisphosphate. MTX-mediated stimulation of inositol phosphate formation is inhibited in the absence of calcium, whereas the response to fMLP is not. The calcium ionophore ionomycin stimulates the formation of inositol phosphates in differentiated HL-60 cells. The magnitude of the response is smaller than that obtained with MTX. Ionomycin also induces a rapid but sustained increase of [Ca++]i. In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, neither fMLP nor ionomycin induce significant inositol phosphate formation, and the increase in [Ca++]i elicited by ionomycin is transient. In contrast, the effects of MTX on phosphoinositide breakdown and on [Ca++]i in undifferentiated cells are nearly identical to those elicited by MTX in differentiated cells. In the presence of the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA, fMLP, ionomycin and MTX still stimulate the generation of inositol phosphates. Guanyl nucleotides and calcium stimulate phospholipase C activity in membrane preparations from differentiated HL-60 cells. fMLP stimulates the enzyme only in the presence of GTP. MTX has no effect on membrane phospholipase C activity.\r"

M1 sites were 30% of adult levels at 1 week, 70% at 2 weeks, 90% at 3 weeks and equal to adult levels at 4 weeks postpartum. M2 sites, on the other hand, did not show a significant change between the ages of 1 and 6 weeks. Acetylcholine-stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown was detected at all ages tested (1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 weeks). The percentage of conversion of [3H] phosphoinositides to [3H]inositol phosphates, stimulated by 1 mM acetylcholine, increased with age until 3 weeks after birth and then decreased slightly at ages 4 and 6 weeks. Carbachol inhibition of [3H]cyclic AMP accumulation, on the other hand, was undetectable in tissues from 1- and 2-week-old rats, whereas in tissues from 3- and 4-week-old rats, the responses were at 6-week level. Thus, for carbachol inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation, a time in development existed (2 weeks after birth) at which receptors appeared to be present but response to stimulation was absent. To examine indirectly the coupling of binding sites to second messenger systems via guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins, the density of binding sites for the muscarinic receptor agonist, [3H]oxotremorine-M, was measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The activation and accumulation of leukocytes during inflammatory processes such as that initiated by myocardial ischemia and reflow appear to be major determinants of irreversible tissue injury. Myocardial salvage by dual cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitors and selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors has suggested a role for lipoxygenase (LOX) products, such as the potent chemotactic factor leukotriene B4, in ischemia-reflow injury. However, many LOX inhibitors are antioxidants and several have been shown to directly inhibit neutrophil function in vitro, thereby questioning the role of LOX products in reperfusion injury. To clarify further the protective mechanism of lipoxygenase inhibitors, we have examined the effects of two nonantioxidant inhibitors, SK&F 86002 and REV-5901, on human neutrophil activation and function in vitro. The antioxidant LOX inhibitor nordihydroguiaretic acid, which served as a positive control, exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and recombinant C5a-induced neutrophil bipolarization, fMLP-induced upregulation of the adherence glycoprotein Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), fMLP-induced aggregation and neutrophil adherence to and migration through interleukin-1-stimulated human endothelial monolayers. In contrast, neither SK&F 86002 nor REV-5901 (in concentrations up to 50 microM) had any effect on these functions, nor did they inhibit neutrophil oxidative metabolism (phorbol myristate acetate-induced chemiluminescence). Inasmuch as both of these agents have been observed to reduce myocardial ischemia-reflow injury in vivo, their failure to directly inhibit neutrophil function further supports an important role for chemotactic LOX products in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury.\r"

  ".W": "The benzazepine compound SCH-12679 has been shown to have clinical efficacy against aggressive behavior in mentally deficient patients. The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the potential mechanism of action of SCH-12679. Because of the structural similarity of SCH-12679 to compounds influencing D1-dopamine receptors, even though in vitro studies indicated no direct action on this receptor, investigations focused on the possibility that in vivo SCH-12679 antagonizes the function of this dopamine receptor subtype. After i.p. administration to neonatal-6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats, SCH-12679 reduced, dose-dependently, the locomotor activity induced by SKF-38393, a D1-dopamine agonist. A dose of SCH-12679 that antagonized the activity induced by SKF-38393 in neonatally lesioned rats also blocked various behaviors observed after administration of this D1-dopamine agonist. SCH-12679 did not alter the activity or behavioral responses induced by quinpirole, a D2-dopamine agonist, when administered to 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. SCH-12679 antagonized the self-mutilation behavior and behavioral responses induced by L-dihydroxyphenylalanine in neonatal-6-OHDA lesioned rats in a manner similar to the prototypic D1-dopamine antagonist SCH-23390 and, like SCH-23390, produced a deficit in avoidance responding in unlesioned rats. SCH-12679 produced a small, transient activation of locomotor activity immediately after administration to neonatal-6-OHDA-lesioned rats that was not observed in unlesioned or adult-6-OHDA-lesioned rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90188901\r", 
  ".W": "Many cells develop an adaptive increase in the capacity of adenylate cyclase to synthesize cyclic AMP (cAMP) after prolonged (hours or days) exposure to drugs which initially inhibit enzyme activity. Recent evidence suggests that adaptive increases in cAMP responses can be induced within minutes by inhibitory drugs. We have investigated the kinetics for induction and decay of this phenomenon in mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma hybrid cells. The muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol induced an increase in prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP accumulation within 2 min of pretreatment with carbachol; the increase was 70 to 100% above control values after exposure to carbachol for 30 min. Enhanced cAMP responsiveness decayed with a half-life of about 8 min after removal of carbachol. Pretreatment with carbachol for 30 hr led to an enhanced cAMP response which decayed in two components, a rapid component and an additional, more stable component which persisted for at least 2 hr after withdrawal of carbachol. Pertussis toxin prevented these effects of carbachol. Prevention of carbachol-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation below basal concentrations with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor did not prevent the ability of carbachol to acutely induce augmented prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma hybrid cells exhibit an enhanced cAMP response after both acute and chronic exposure to a muscarinic cholinergic agonist although these processes decay with different time courses. The signal for this acutely induced adaptation does not appear to be the decrease in cellular cAMP concentration resulting from inhibition of adenylate cyclase but does require a pertussis toxin-sensitive substrate.\r"

The present findings show that right atria obtained from rats in an early stage of sepsis were supersensitive to the chronotropic actions of the beta-agonists, isoproterenol (ISO), fenoterol (FEN) and prenalterol (PREN). The supersensitivity to the chronotropic actions of ISO and FEN was much greater than that which developed to PREN. The positive chronotropic actions of isobutylmethylxanthine and forskolin were not affected by sepsis. The receptor subtypes mediating the responses to ISO, FEN and PREN by control and septic right atria were characterized by functional assays using selective beta-1 and beta-2 antagonists. The results showed that the chronotropic response produced by all three agonists on right atria obtained from control rats were mediated by beta-1 receptors. In contrast, the chronotropic actions of ISO and FEN on atria from septic rats were mediated by what appears to be beta-2 receptors and those of PREN by beta-1 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Superfused slices of human neocortex, prepared from surgically removed tissue (to gain access to subcortical tumors) and prelabeled selectively with [3H]norepinephrine (NE) or [3H]choline, were stimulated electrically to evoke tritium overflow. This tritium overflow was abolished by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin and by withdrawal of extracellular Ca++. Thus, the action potential-induced, exocytotic tritium overflow supports the assumption of a quasiphysiological release of NE from noradrenergic and of acetylcholine (ACh) from cholinergic nerve terminals, respectively. In addition, the modulation of NE release by adrenoceptor ligands displayed the appropriate pharmacology of alpha-2 autoreceptors; ACh release was modulated by muscarinic ligands. Both NE and ACh release decreased with the age of the patients. The effects of drugs on NE and ACh release were not age-related. The peptide modulator of the N-type voltage sensitive Ca++ channel, omega-conotoxin GVIA, inhibited NE release with an IC50 of about 14 nM and ACh release with an IC50 of about 3 nM, whereas L-type modulators were ineffective. The binding of [125I]omega-conotoxin GVIA to human neocortical membranes was of high affinity (KD = 1.3 pM) to one site (nH = 0.97) of substantial density (maximum binding = 878 fmol/mg of protein); the binding of the L-type modulator [3H]isradipine to these membranes was also of high affinity (KD = 89 pM) to one site (nH = 1.03) of lesser density (maximum binding = 429 fmol/mg of protein). In conclusion, Ca++ entry through N-type Ca++ channels, rather then L-type Ca++ channels, predominates in subserving NE and ACh release from noradrenergic and cholinergic nerve terminals, respectively, of human neocortex.\r"

Bone marrow recovery occurred within an average of 5.4 months. A response was seen in 3 with antithymocyte globulin. One patient required an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. A combination of corticosteroids and androgens was associated with recovery in 5. Blood and platelet transfusions and antibiotics were instituted only when clinically indicated. We conclude that the prognosis of GSTM induced marrow suppression is better than previously reported.\r"

The parent KM12C cells were incubated for 2 months in medium containing recombinant human IFN-alpha hybrid BBDD (r-IFN-alpha) or recombinant human IFN-gamma (r-IFN-gamma). Surviving variants were designated KM12 alpha R and KM12 gamma R, respectively. KM12 alpha R cells were cross-resistant to the cytostatic and cytolytic effects of r-IFN-alpha, r-IFN-beta, and r-IFN-gamma, whereas KM12 gamma R cells were resistant only to the effects of r-IFN-gamma. The parent and variant cell lines had similar in vitro growth rates and similar tumorigenicity in male BALB/c nude mice, but the mechanisms for resistance to IFNs differed in the two variant lines. The resistance of the cross-resistant KM12 alpha R cell line was not attributable to the loss of specific receptors, because our analyses demonstrated the presence of receptors for IFN-gamma, whereas the KM12 gamma R line lacked specific receptors for IFN-gamma. Northern blot analyses revealed that messenger RNA (mRNA) from the proto-oncogene c-myc was equally expressed in the IFN-sensitive and IFN-resistant cell lines and that treatment with r-IFN-gamma did not alter its expression. Treatment with r-IFN-gamma induced the expression of manganous superoxide dismutase mRNA in KM12C and KM12 alpha R cells, but not in KM12 gamma R cells, confirming that both KM12C and KM12 alpha R cells, but not KM12 gamma R cells, have functional receptors for IFN-gamma.\r"

In the present study, we determined whether an inhibitor of these proteinases could inhibit the ability of tumor cells to degrade collagen and to metastasize. Metalloproteinases with degradative activities for type I collagen, type IV collagen, gelatin, and casein were secreted by a highly metastatic rat embryo cell line (4R) transfected by c-Ha-ras1 (also known as HRAS1). These metalloproteinases were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate substrate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as 92-kilodalton and 68-kilodalton gelatinolytic enzymes and 48-kilodalton and 45-kilodalton caseinolytic proteinases. A recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (rTIMP) completely inhibited the proteolytic activities of these enzymes and was also a potent inhibitor of the proteolytic degradation of collagen by intact c-Ha-ras1-transfected cells. The ability of these cells to colonize the lungs after intravenous injection into nude mice was inhibited by 83% when rTIMP was repeatedly injected intraperitoneally into the animals. These data demonstrate that rTIMP is a potent inhibitor of the metalloproteinase activities of these cells and can also inhibit their metastatic potential.\r"

All women with type 3 stress incontinence had failed a previous anti-incontinence operation. Patients in both groups underwent suprapubic needle suspension and an additional bladder neck support procedure. Among 33 patients who underwent preoperative urodynamic studies 30 had stable bladders (90%), while 3 had low pressure detrusor instability (10%). The success rate in achieving continence, including cured and improved patients, was 94.6% with a followup of 3 to 72 months. Four patients (10%) required temporary intermittent catheterization for 3 to 4 weeks but none presented with long-term voiding dysfunction. The added bladder neck support improved our results in these complicated female incontinence cases compared to the standard suprapubic needle suspension procedures alone. The combined procedure currently is our method of choice for treatment of type 3 and other complicated cases of female urinary incontinence.\r"

At this time, there was no or only slight contraction of the urinary bladder induced by its distension, while the contraction was noted before the treatment. However, phenylephrine, an alpha 1-receptor agonist, applied intrathecally in 6-hydroxydopamine-treated animals induced moderate bladder contraction. In sham-operated animals, the bladder contraction on its distension was inhibited by intrathecally applied prazosin, an alpha 1-receptor antagonist. Thus, in the micturition reflex, norepinephrine derived from the locus coeruleus acts on the alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in the sacral cord, and induces urinary bladder contraction via activation of the sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Bladder outlet obstruction has been shown to cause detrusor contractile dysfunction. To determine if alterations in bladder metabolism may in part underlie these functional defects, we investigated the effects of mild outlet obstruction on the glucose metabolism of the rabbit urinary bladder. Mild outlet obstruction was created in mature male rabbits by the surgical placement of a silicon sleeve around the bladder neck. Two weeks after surgery, the in vitro ability of the obstructed bladder tissues to metabolize glucose was compared to that of the controls. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) The bladder wet weight increased 2.3-fold following two weeks of obstruction. 2) Obstructed bladder tissues had a reduced glucose consumption as compared to the controls. 3) CO2 generation was significantly reduced by 31% in obstructed bladder tissues whereas lactate formation increased significantly by 22%. 4) Tissue concentrations of ATP, creatine phosphate, and glycogen before incubation showed no significant differences between control and obstructed bladder tissues. In summary, bladder tissues following two weeks obstruction showed a decrease in aerobic metabolism and an increase in anaerobic metabolism. Previous studies have indicated that the ability of the bladder to maintain a contraction and empty may be directly related to aerobic metabolism. Therefore, the decrease in aerobic metabolism (even in the presence of increased anaerobic metabolism) may in part explain the decreased ability of the obstructed bladder to empty.\r"

In this study, human mesangial cells (HMC) were examined during serum-free culture in which the cells were reversibly growth arrested and did not suffer obvious irreversible functional changes. Non-stimulated cells released 2 to 10 pg/24 hr/micrograms cellular protein of PGE2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, while TXB2 was not detectable. Stimulation with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) induced up to 18-fold (IL-1 beta) or up to fourfold (TNF alpha) increases of prostanoid release. Combinations of the two monokines resulted in significant synergistic induction of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha up to 38 times that of control cells. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the HMC-mitogen, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) only induced marginal increases in HMC prostanoid generation. However, when PDGF-BB or -AB was combined with IL-1 beta or IL-6, prostanoid generation by HMC was synergistically increased up to 222-fold (IL-1 beta) or 12-fold (IL-6) above the control values, with the induction of PGE2 greater than 6-keto-PGF1 alpha greater than PGF2 alpha much greater than TXB2. In the case of IL-1 beta + PDGF-BB the induction of PGE2 release was at least partly due to the synergistic induction of cyclooxygenase activity. These findings demonstrate that both proliferating and reversibly growth arrested HMCs release prostaglandins in response to various inflammatory stimulators and combinations thereof. The findings support the important role of HMC in the regulation of glomerular hemodynamics during inflammatory processes.\r"

  ".W": "To further characterize changes in tubular Na-K-ATPase in acute tubular necrosis (ATN), segmental analysis was performed in rat nephrons. Na-K-ATPase was assayed in the following segments: proximal convolution (PC), proximal straight (PS), outer medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL), cortical thick ascending limb (CTAL), distal convolution (DC) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) in three groups of rats: 1.) intact; 2.) moderate non-oliguric ATN; and 3.) severe oliguric ATN. GFR and CNa/GFR X 100 were in group 1 0.80 +/- 0.05 ml/min and 0.68 +/- 0.06, in group 2 0.14 +/- 0.02 and 1.46 +/- 0.35, and in group 3 0.04 +/- 0.01 and 0.46 +/- 0.15, respectively. Na-K-ATPase in PC and PS were similar in all three groups. Na-K-ATPase levels were in MTAL: in group 1 37 +/- 2 X 10(-11) mol/mm/min, in group 2 20 +/- 1 X 10(-11), P less than 0.001 versus group 1, and in group 3 24 +/- 2 X 10(-11), P less than 0.001 versus group 1. In CTAL Na-K-ATPase levels were: in group 1 40 +/- 2 X 10(-11), in group 2 33 +/- 1 X 10(-11), P less than 0.001 versus group 1, and in group 3 27 +/- 2 X 10(-11), P less than 0.001 versus groups 1 and 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the actions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the human distal nephron, we studied interactions between ANP (0.02 micrograms/kg.min i.v.) and acutely administered substances acting in the distal nephron, that is, amiloride and aldosterone, in six healthy humans during maximal water diuresis. ANP increased NaCl excretion, fractional lithium excretion (FELi) and decreased diluting segment reabsorption estimated from free water clearance. Amiloride increased natriuresis, had no effect on FELi, but decreased diluting segment reabsorption. Aldosterone had the opposite effect. When infused in addition to amiloride, ANP still increased NaCl excretion, the changes in sodium handling parameters being comparable to those seen after ANP alone. Amiloride did not increase the further natriuretic response to ANP. These findings suggest that ANP increases distal sodium delivery, and decreases sodium reabsorption in distal segments by a mechanism also sensitive to amiloride. ANP abolished much of the antinatriuretic effect of aldosterone, which may also be explained by assuming a partial overlap of the target segments of ANP and aldosterone in the distal nephron. Remarkably, in neither of these experiments was the natriuresis after ANP accompanied by a kaliuresis, for which the explanation remains obscure.\r"

With the initial protocol heparin infusion or bolus were compared with aspirin; with a modified protocol, heparin infusion, the best of these three treatments, was compared with alteplase. Patients were monitored for 3 days after starting treatment and then observed clinically for 4 more days. On the first days of treatment heparin infusion significantly decreased the frequency of angina (by 84-94%), episodes of silent ischaemia (by 71-77%), and the overall duration of ischaemia (by 81-86%). Heparin bolus and aspirin were not effective. Alteplase caused small (non-significant) reductions on the first day only. Only minor bleeding complications occurred.\r"

  ".W": "Some surgeons avoid placing a jejunostomy in patients with complications, fearing either exacerbation of the disease during enteral feedings or complications from the jejunostomies. Eleven patients with hemorrhagic pancreatitis (four), pancreatic abscess (five), or infected pseudocyst (two) underwent placements of needle (five) or Red Robinson (six) jejunal catheters during laparotomy. Five patients had been given 30.8 +/- 16 liters of TPN over 25 +/- 12 days preoperatively. Only two patients received TPN postoperatively because of progressive sepsis with enteral intolerance to feedings. One of these patients developed a jejunal leak near the placement of the Red Robinson catheter. Both patients died of complications from their pancreatic disease. The remaining nine patients received 35.6 +/- 8.6 liters of enteral feedings over 31 +/- 6.8 days before resuming oral intake. Glucosuria and hyperglycemia were common, but easily managed. No catheters were lost, and diarrhea necessitating slowing and diluting the diet was unusual after the first week. Enteral feeding did not elevate amylase values. Therefore, jejunal feedings can be given safely in patients with severe acute pancreatic disease to provide prolonged nutrition without aggravating the disease.\r"
