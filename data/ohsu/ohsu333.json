The sternocleidomastoid myoperiosteal flap uses clavicular periosteum on a muscle pedicle to provide vascularity. Clavicular periosteum is fibrous, durable, and will conform to the shape of the trachea, forming bone to provide stability to the airway. The procedure is relatively simple and involves single-staged reconstruction. After 4 years' experience with this flap, we present the results from a series of 11 patients who underwent subglottic or tracheal reconstruction with the sternocleidomastoid myoperiosteal flap. Ten of 11 patients were successfully decannulated. The average time from reconstruction to decannulation was 50.3 days. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 40 months. We also describe modifications of the initial technique that have been introduced to improve the flap's versatility and effectiveness.\r"

Recording from muscles innervated by cranial nerves has not previously been reported. A unilateral hemispheric craniotomy was performed in 24 dogs. An electric stimulus was delivered directly to the exposed motor cortex via surface electrodes. Evoked electromyographic responses to motor cortex stimulation were recorded from the contralateral orbicularis oculi and orbicularis oris muscles. Preliminary investigation into the use of magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex is compared to direct electrical cortical stimulation. This study demonstrates the potential for magnetic stimulation in the intraoperative and outpatient clinical evaluation of facial nerve disorders. It appears possible, for the first time using magnetic stimulation, to noninvasively stimulate these nerves proximal to the point of injury and to evaluate more central conduction pathways.\r"

All patients were males, and two patients were black. The average age was 14.8 years. Nasopharyngeal masses, epistaxis, and facial asymmetry were the most common presenting symptoms. Tumors extended along predetermined pathways following the vascularity of the external carotid system. CNS extension arose via the superior orbital fissure or direct extension from the sphenoid sinus. Angiography described the neoplastic vascularity, CT with contrast demonstrated tumor location and extracranial extension, and MRI best demonstrated CNS invasion. All lesions were reclassified according to the American Joint Committee staging system. Twenty-seven patients were operated upon; four with cryotherapy and 23 following embolization. Two tumors recurred and needed additional surgery. One patient with CNS invasion was treated with estrogen and radiotherapy for cure. Tumor staging is not particularly helpful in decision making, because surgery must be individualized according to tumor location and extent. Surgical approaches for specific tumor locations are discussed.\r"

To further evaluate this phenomenon, several MRI examinations of the nasal cavity were performed within an 8- to 12-hour period. The study demonstrated that changes alternated from side to side and were interrupted by the administration of topical vasoconstriction, confirming imaging of the normal nasal cycle. Changes were also observed within the ethmoid sinuses. Signal intensity on T2-weighted images during the congested phase was similar to inflammatory mucosa. Occasionally, these changes make interpretation of the extent of pathology difficult in patients with sinus disease, and raise the possibility of inflammatory pathology in asymptomatic patients. Awareness of MRI imaging of nasal cycle should reduce the likelihood of diagnostic errors and provides another method for study of this physiologic phenomenon.\r"

Historically, radical surgical intervention was the primary method of treatment. The treatment of choice has shifted during the past 20 years to aggressive systemic antibiotic therapy, with surgery reserved for those patients whose disease is resistant to medical therapy. Using this approach, 19 patients with necrotizing external otitis were treated at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation during the past 8 years. A 90% rate of cure was obtained. The diagnostic approach to patients suspected of having necrotizing external otitis, a classification scheme defining the extent of disease, delivery of systemic antibiotic therapy, indications for surgical intervention, and overall effectiveness of treatment are reviewed.\r"

The liposarcoma and six of the lipomas were resected at formal parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation. Two patients with small intraglandular lipomas have elected to undergo long-term clinical and imaging observation. Our experience indicates that high-resolution, soft-tissue imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging permits consistent preoperative fatty tumor diagnosis.

The finding of low gastric pH values at postmortem examination in patients whose larynx was severely traumatized after endotracheal intubation suggested that gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is an important factor in the pathogenesis of these problems. To evaluate the occurrence and character of GER as well as its effects upon the larynx and trachea of intubated patients, clinical observations and several animal models were employed. Monitoring of pH values for GER was performed in intubated patients both in the operating room and the intensive care unit with a 40% incidence of GER in ICU patients not receiving antacid therapy. After exposure to gastric juice, marked inflammation and necrosis were observed in the larynx of rabbits, and a significant reduction of mucociliary flow was found to occur in the dog's trachea. The physiology and mechanisms of these events are discussed and indicate that GER may play an important role in the development of permanent laryngeal and tracheal injury in the intubated patient. It is recommended that pharyngeal pH be monitored in intubated patients because their altered state of consciousness may predispose to gastric reflux. When GER is encountered, initiation of treatment should be undertaken because prevention is considerably more effective than subsequent treatment.\r"

The pathogenesis of the esophageal web and the cause of dysphagia in this syndrome were investigated radiographically, endoscopically, manometrically, and histologically. It was considered that the web seen in the esophagogram may have been formed due to the restriction of dilation of the esophageal wall, which results from repetitive inflammation and the subsequent healing process. Dysphagia in this syndrome may be explained by a decrease in swallowing power. Iron deficiency anemia may play the main role in the above histological changes and the resulting decrease in swallowing power.\r"

Of 106 consecutive patients with gouty arthritis (GA), 42 (40%) had articular inflammation at 2 or more sites. Comparison of these 42 patients with GA with the 64 patients with GA who presented with monoarthritis yielded the following conclusions: 1) Polyarticular gout represents one end of a generally predictable spectrum of GA, reflecting chronicity associated with poor patients understanding, poor patient compliance, and suboptimal physician management. 2) Polyarticular patients with GA tend to develop attacks of more smoldering onset and increasing duration, while joint involvement tends to occur in an ascending but asymmetrical fashion, with upper extremity joints later added to repeatedly active lower extremity sites. 3) There may be a significant discrepancy between the site (or sites) of the GA patient's chief complaint and clinically involved joints on careful physical examination. 4) Recognition of polyarticular joint involvement increases the number of sites for potential joint and/or tophus aspiration, permitting greater ease of establishing a definitive diagnosis. 5) No single laboratory or synovial fluid value meaningfully distinguishes patients with polyarticular from those with monoarticular gout.\r"

The mean age was 31 years, and seven were male. All 20 patients had structural or functional abnormalities of the kidneys or both. Three had end-stage renal disease, with two requiring maintenance hemodialysis. The remaining 17 patients had normal serum creatinine values and estimated creatinine clearances. Half the subjects had hypertension. Fourteen of 17 patients could not concentrate urine above 750 mOsm per kilogram of body weight even after vasopressin, whereas all 10 normal controls could. Urinary pH decreased below 5.3 after ammonium chloride administration in all 15 normal controls, but in only 13 of 18 patients. Calyceal clubbing or blunting was evident in 18 of 19 patients studied by intravenous pyelography; 13 patients had calyceal cysts or diverticula. Seventeen of 19 patients had lobulated renal outlines of the fetal type. Four patients had diffuse renal cortical loss, but only two of these had renal insufficiency. We conclude that Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome includes the presence of renal abnormalities.\r"

In 1287 consecutive patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we assessed the results of initial treatment with this device by firefighters who arrived first at the scene, as compared with the results of standard defibrillation administered by paramedics who arrived slightly after the firefighters. Of 276 patients who were initially treated by firefighters using the automatic defibrillator, 84 (30 percent) survived to hospital discharge (expected rate according to a logistic model, 17 percent; P less than 0.001), as compared with 44 (19 percent) of 228 patients when fire-fighters delivered only basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the first defibrillation was performed after the arrival of the paramedic team. Few patients with conditions other than ventricular fibrillation survived. In a multivariate analysis of characteristics that influenced survival after ventricular fibrillation, a better survival rate was related to a witnessed collapse (odds ratio, 3.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 7.6), younger age (odds ratio, 1.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.4), the presence of \"coarse\" (higher-amplitude) fibrillation (odds ratio, 4.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 11.0), a shorter response time for paramedics (odds ratio, 1.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.1), and initial treatment by firefighters using an automatic external defibrillator (odds ratio, 1.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.9). These findings support the widespread use of the automatic external defibrillator as an important part of the treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, although the overall impact of the use of this device on community survival rates is still uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "We studied alcohol use before the onset of a first seizure in 308 patients with seizures and 294 controls. The risk of seizures increased with increasing current alcohol use. For unprovoked seizures (i.e., seizures occurring without an antecedent event, such as a recent stroke), the adjusted odds ratios rose from 3-fold at intakes of 51 to 100 g of ethanol per day (95 percent confidence limits, 1.3 and 6.3), to 8-fold at 101 to 200 g per day (95 percent confidence limits, 3.3 and 18.7), and to almost 20-fold at 201 to 300 g per day (95 percent confidence limits, 6.1 and 6.2). For provoked seizures, the odds ratios were lower and statistically significant only above 200 g per day (odds ratio, 10.1; 95 percent confidence limits, 2.3 and 43.8 at 201 to 300 g per day; odds ratio, 7.4; 95 percent confidence limits, 1.8 and 30.5 above 300 g per day). Among ex-drinkers (abstention greater than or equal to 1 year), no increased risk was detected. Alcohol withdrawal was not associated with the onset of seizures in this study; 16 percent of first seizures in drinkers fell outside the conventionally defined withdrawal period, and the remainder exhibited a seemingly random timing after the last drink. We conclude that the relation of seizures to alcohol use is dose dependent and appears to be causal, and that seizures can be interpreted as a disorder induced by the ingestion of alcohol, independently of alcohol withdrawal.\r"

We identified 39 patients seen at our institution over an eight-year period with acute rhabdomyolysis after cocaine use. The patients' mean creatine kinase level was 12,187 U per liter (range, 1756 to 85,000). Thirteen of the 39 patients (33 percent) had acute renal failure; 6 of them died. In comparison to the patients with normal renal function, those with renal failure were more often admitted with profound hypotension (46 vs. 4 percent; P less than 0.001), hyperpyrexia (69 vs. 15 percent; P less than 0.001), and markedly elevated serum creatine kinase levels (mean, 28,084 vs. 7931 U per liter; P less than 0.01). Disseminated intravascular coagulation developed in seven patients with renal failure. All six deaths were in this group. Severe hepatic dysfunction was found in 11 patients with renal failure. We conclude that cocaine intoxication can cause acute rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure, severe liver dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation and that the mortality rate among patients with this syndrome is high.\r"

  ".W": "Bulimia nervosa is a prevalent disorder of unknown cause, characterized by recurrent episodes of uncontrollable eating. In the light of recent evidence that the gastrointestinal hormone cholecystokinin induces satiety and reduces food intake in laboratory animals and humans, we investigated the hypothesis that abnormalities in cholecystokinin secretion and satiety may occur in patients with bulimia and contribute to their disturbed eating patterns. Blood levels of cholecystokinin and subjective satiety were measured in 14 women with bulimia and 10 normal women before and after a mixed-liquid meal. The total integrated plasma cholecystokinin response to eating was significantly impaired in patients with bulimia (P less than 0.05) as was postprandial satiety. Fasting cholecystokinin levels were similar in both populations (approximately 0.8 pmol per liter). After eating, however, mean (+/- SEM) peak plasma cholecystokinin levels increased to 4.1 +/- 0.9 pmol per liter in normal controls but to only 2.1 +/- 0.2 pmol per liter in patients with bulimia nervosa (P less than 0.05). After an open trial of tricyclic antidepressants in a subgroup of five patients with bulimia, the postprandial cholecystokinin response to eating increased significantly, to 6.6 +/- 1.2 pmol per liter (P less than 0.05), and there was an increase in the satiety response. We conclude that patients with bulimia do not have normal satiety and have impaired secretion of cholecystokinin in response to a meal. Preliminary evidence suggests that both these abnormalities may be improved by treatment with tricyclic antidepressants.\r"

Endoscopic duodenal biopsy in all four patients revealed subtotal villous atrophy due to celiac disease. We undertook a prospective study to evaluate the extent to which this finding predicted celiac disease in 65 consecutive patients referred for intestinal biopsy. Duodenal folds were absent or markedly decreased in 15 of 17 patients with subtotal villous atrophy and in 8 of 48 patients with partial villous atrophy or normal duodenal mucosa, giving a sensitivity of 88 percent and a specificity of 83 percent for this endoscopic finding with respect to celiac disease. We recommend that all patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy be examined for the loss or reduction of duodenal folds and, should this be found, that the examination include duodenal biopsy. The value of this procedure as an aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease should be particularly great in patients with minimal, transient, or unrelated symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "We performed echocardiography prospectively 4.9 +/- 0.7 years apart (mean +/- SD), in 74 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. On the basis of the first study, the patients were distributed in four groups according to the type of valvular involvement: 7 patients had vegetations (Libman-Sacks endocarditis; group 1); 6 patients had rigid and thickened valves with stenosis, regurgitation, or both (group 2); 5 patients had miscellaneous forms of valvular involvement without valvular dysfunction (group 3), as did the 60 controls; and 56 patients had no valvular disease (group 4). The overall prevalence of clinically important valvular disease (groups 1 and 2) was 18 percent. Patients in group 1 were younger than those in group 2 (33.5 +/- 16.7 vs. 47.8 +/- 17.6 years; P less than 0.05), had a shorter mean duration of lupus (4.8 +/- 2.2 vs. 10.7 +/- 6.4 years; P less than 0.001), and had received a smaller cumulative dose of steroids (21.5 +/- 13.1 vs. 79.5 +/- 63.4 g of methylprednisolone or its equivalent; P less than 0.05). During the five-year follow-up, one patient in group 1 and five in group 2 required valve surgery, no patient in group 3 had valvular dysfunction, and five patients in group 4 had mild valvular lesions. We conclude that clinically important valvular involvement in systemic lupus is relatively frequent and sometimes requires surgery. Echocardiography can identify a subset of lesions (valvular thickening and dysfunction), other than verrucous (Libman-Sacks) endocarditis, that are prone to hemodynamic deterioration.\r"

Resource inputs by physicians include (1) total work input performed by the physician for each service; (2) practice costs, including malpractice premiums; and (3) the cost of specialty training. These factors were combined to produce a relative-value scale denominated in nonmonetary units. We describe here the process by which the physician's work was defined and estimated. The study asked two questions: What is the physician's work for each service performed? and Can work be estimated reliably and validly? We concluded that a physician's work has four major dimensions: time, mental effort and judgment, technical skill and physical effort, and psychological stress. We found that physicians can rate the relative amount of work of the services within their specialty directly, taking into account all the dimensions of work. Moreover, these ratings are highly reproducible, consistent, and therefore probably valid.\r"

These adhesion molecules have distinct functions involving different cells at different developmental stages, but may cooperate when expressed together. Families of adhesion molecules which share common carbohydrate domains do exist, despite the structural and functional diversity of these glycoproteins. These include the Ca2+-independent neural adhesion molecules: N-CAM, myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) and L1. L1 is involved in neuron-neuron adhesion, neurite fasciculation, outgrowth of neurites, cerebellar granule cell migration, neurite outgrowth on Schwann cells and interactions among epithelial cells of intestinal crypts. We show here that in addition to sharing carbohydrate epitopes with N-CAM and MAG, L1 is also a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It contains six C2 domains and also shares three type III domains with the extracellular matrix adhesion molecule fibronectin.\r"

We present the identification of single divalent cation channels from thrombin-activated human platelets. Membrane vesicles from unstimulated and thrombin-stimulated human platelets were incorporated in planar bilayers and unitary currents through single channels were measured. Divalent cation selective channels could only be demonstrated in thrombin-stimulated preparations. These channels share a number of properties in common with voltage-dependent calcium channels--a high degree of selectivity for divalent cations, a single channel conductance of about 10 pS (in 150 mM Ba2+) and sensitivity to blockade by inorganic calcium channel blockers such as Ni2+. In other respects, these channels are different as they are not voltage-dependent and are not blocked by 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists.\r"

Resact (Cys-Val-Thr-Gly-Ala-Pro-Gly-Cys-Val-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Leu-NH2), the chemotactic peptide released by sea urchin Arbacia punctulata eggs, is specifically crosslinked to A. punctulata spermatozoan guanylate cyclase. After the binding of the peptide the state of guanylate cyclase phosphorylation modulates enzyme activity. We report here that the deduced amino-acid sequence of the spermatozoan membrane form of guanylate cyclase predicts an intrinsic membrane protein of 986 amino acids with an amino-terminal signal sequence. A single transmembrane domain separates the protein into putative extracellular and cytoplasmic-catalytic domains. The cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal 95 amino acids contain 20% serine, the likely regulatory sites for phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, the enzyme is homologous to the protein kinase family.\r"

Protein 4.9 is a substrate for various kinases, including a cyclic AMP(cAMP)-dependent one, in vivo and in vitro. We show here that phosphorylation of protein 4.9 by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase reversibly abolishes its actin-bundling activity, but phosphorylation by protein kinase C has no such effect. A quantitative immunoassay showed that human erythrocytes contain 43,000 trimers of protein 4.9 per cell, which is equivalent to one trimer for each actin oligomer in these red blood cells. As analogues of protein 4.9 have been identified together with analogues of other erythroid skeletal proteins in non-erythroid tissues of numerous vertebrates, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of protein 4.9 may be the basis for a mechanism that regulates actin bundling in many cells.\r"

The distinct activating regions of GAL4 are rich in acidic residues and it has been suggested that these regions interact with another protein component of the transcriptional machinery (such as the TATA-binding protein or RNA polymerase II) while the DNA-binding region serves to position the activating region near the gene. Here we show that various GAL4 derivatives, when expressed at high levels in yeast, inhibit transcription of certain genes lacking GAL4 binding sites, that more efficient activators inhibit more strongly and that inhibition does not depend on the DNA-binding domain. We suggest that this inhibition, which we call squelching, reflects titration of a transcription factor by the activating region of GAL4.\r"

However in some respects biomolecules are at the borders of the domain of applicability of classical mechanics. The role of quantum mechanical effects in biomolecular structure and function is therefore worth investigating. Here we present preliminary results from a quantum simulation of a protein and contrast them with results from full classical simulations. The most significant differences are found in motions of high frequency, such as bond stretching or the torsional oscillation of groups that bear hydrogen atoms. The amplitudes of such motions are significantly increased by the penetration of atoms into classically forbidden regions. These differences will directly influence the rates of such processes as proton and electron transfer.\r"

This question can be readily addressed for the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) because developmentally specified modifications of this ligand-gated ion channel can be directly related to changes in membrane currents. In developing rat soleus muscle, spontaneous transmitter release causes miniature end-plate currents (m.e.p.cs) to flow into the muscle cell. We show here that these m.e.p.cs in neonatal soleus trigger spontaneous contractions. By injecting m.e.p.cs into young fibres, we showed that only embryonic m.e.p.cs can trigger such contractions; adult m.e.p.cs do not last long enough. Developing muscle fibres must be active for synapse and muscle differentiation. Our experiments indicate that the embryonic form of the AChR is essential for spontaneous contractile activity and may therefore be required for normal neuromuscular development.\r"

In Drosophila, maternal effect mutations are known that impair the normal function of each centre. Injection of wild-type cytoplasm into mutant eggs has revealed that morphogenetic signals localized at the anterior and posterior pole of eggs can be transplanted. We show here that these activities can also be detected during oogenesis. Posterior activity can be recovered at an early stage (stage 10, ref. 5) from the oocyte-nurse cell complex, but anterior activity can only be detected in the mature oocytes (stage 14). We conclude that the bicoid-dependent anterior signal, although produced by the nurse cells, does not become active before it is localized to the anterior egg pole, whereas posterior activity can be detected in the nurse cells before, and therefore independently of, its localization to the posterior egg pole.\r"

  ".W": "We have been studying a population of bipotential glial progenitor cells in the perinatal rat optic nerve and brain in an attempt to understand how cells choose between alternative fates in the developing mammalian central nervous system (CNS). This cell population gives rise initially to oligodendrocytes and then to type-2 astrocytes, both of which apparently collaborate in sheathing axons in the CNS. In vitro studies suggest that oligodendrocyte differentiation is the constitutive pathway of development for the oligodendrocyte-type-2-astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cell, whereas type-2 astrocyte differentiation depends on a specific inducing protein. This protein is present in the developing optic nerve when type-2 astrocytes are differentiating and can induce O-2A progenitor cells in vitro to express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocyte differentiation. Here we show that the type-2-astrocyte-inducing protein is similar or identical to ciliary neutrotrophic factor (CNTF), which promotes the survival of some types of peripheral neurons in vitro, including ciliary ganglion neurons. This suggests that CNTF, in addition to its effect on neurons, may be responsible for triggering type-2 astrocyte differentiation in the developing CNS.\r"

Neurotransmitter action at the GABAA receptor is potentiated by both benzodiazepines and barbiturates which are therapeutically useful drugs (reviewed in ref. 1). There is strong evidence that this receptor is heterogeneous. We have previously isolated complementary DNAs encoding an alpha- and a beta-subunit and shown that both are needed for expression of a functional GABAA receptor. We have now isolated cDNAs encoding two additional GABAA receptor alpha-subunits, confirming the heterogeneous nature of the receptor/chloride channel complex and demonstrating a molecular basis for it. These alpha-subunits are differentially expressed within the CNS and produce, when expressed with the beta-subunit in Xenopus oocytes, receptor subtypes which can be distinguished by their apparent sensitivity to GABA. Highly homologous receptor subtypes which differ functionally seem to be a common feature of brain receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Mice carrying mutations at the W locus located on chromosome 5 are characterized by severe macrocytic anaemia, lack of hair pigmentation and sterility. Mutations at this locus appear to affect the proliferation and/or migration of cells during early embryogenesis and result in an intrinsic defect in the haematopoietic stem cell hierarchy. An understanding of the molecular basis of the complex and pleiotropic phenotype in W mutant mice would thus provide insights into the important developmental processes of gametogenesis, melanogenesis and haematopoiesis. Here we show that the mouse mutant W has a deletion of the c-kit proto-oncogene. Interspecific backcross analysis demonstrates that the W locus is very tightly linked to c-kit and that the two loci cannot be segregated at this level of analysis. c-kit is the cellular homologue of the oncogene v-kit of the HZ4 feline sarcoma virus and encodes a transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase receptor that is structurally similar to the receptors for colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and platelet derived growth factor. The co-localization of c-kit with W provides a molecular entry into this important region of the mouse genome. In addition, these observations provide the first example of a germ-line mutation in a mammalian proto-oncogene and implicate the c-kit gene as a candidate for the W locus.\r"

In most systems, it remains unclear whether the precursors can form many or all cell types (multipotent or totipotent), or only a single cell type (predetermined). The question of cell lineage is central to the neural crest because it gives rise to numerous and diverse derivatives including peripheral neurons, glial and Schwann cells, pigment cells, and cartilage. Although the sets of derivatives arising from different populations of neural crest cells have been well-documented, relatively little is known about the developmental potentials of individual neural crest cells. We have iontophoretically microinjected the vital dye, lysinated rhodamine dextran (LRD) into individual dorsal neural tube cells to mark unambiguously their descendants. Many of the resulting labelled clones consisted of multiple cell types, as judged by both their location and morphology. Cells as diverse as sensory neurons, presumptive pigment cells, ganglionic supportive cells, adrenomedullary cells and neural tube cells were found within individual clones. Our results indicate that at least some neural crest cells are multipotent before their departure from the neural tube.\r"

Four different hypotheses have been proposed to explain this high degree of polymorphism: (1) a high mutation rate, (2) gene conversion or interlocus genetic exchange, (3) over dominant selection and (4) frequency-dependent selection. In an attempt to establish which of these hypotheses is correct, we examined the pattern of nucleotide substitution between polymorphic alleles in the region of the antigen recognition site (ARS) and other regions of human and mouse class I MHC genes. The results indicate that in ARS the rate of nonsynonymous (amino acid altering) substitution is significantly higher than that of synonymous substitution in both humans and mice, whereas in other regions the reverse is true. This observation, together with a theoretical study and other considerations, supports the hypothesis of overdominant selection (heterozygote advantage).\r"

The tat protein greatly enhances the expression of both structural and regulatory genes of HIV-1 (linked to the viral long-terminal-repeat promoter element), whereas the rev gene product (previously termed art or trs) has only been shown to be required for the synthesis of structural proteins. Here, we demonstrate that rev also moderates the expression of regulatory genes of HIV-1. It decreases the expression of messenger RNAs that encode the full-length form of the viral tat gene product or the rev protein itself, and induces the synthesis of a previously unreported, truncated tat protein. These actions of rev are mediated by a dramatic shift in the ratio of spliced to unspliced cytoplasmic HIV-1 mRNA. Therefore rev not only activates the synthesis of the viral structural proteins, but also modulates the level and quality of HIV-1 regulatory gene expression.\r"

Some aqueous metal ions, acting as general acid/base (or electrophilic/nucleophilic) catalysts, can induce site-specific cleavage of RNA. DNA is not cleaved efficiently by the non-redox metal-induced mechanism. However, DNA degradation by radicals formed in the metal-catalysed auto-oxidation of ascorbate (or other reducing agents) is well known. In the past, the observed cleavage reactions have not been very specific. Here, we report a non-enzymatic cleavage of single-stranded DNA occurring at unique sites due to redox reactions involving copper. This could be considered a 'self-cleavage' reaction, by analogy with the lead-induced non-redox RNA cleavage reaction. This site-specific cleavage of DNA, stimulated by ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide, is most efficient under physiological conditions, so this phenomenon may have biological significance.\r"

This movement facilitates the multiple interactions that antibodies make with polyvalent antigens and effector proteins. Comparisons of the atomic structures of immunoglobulins of the same sequence in different crystal environments, and of those with different sequences, have shown that the movements involve local changes in the conformation of the peptides linking different domains. These changes occur in (1) the hinge regions that link the Fab fragment to the Fc, and (2) the switch regions that link the VL-VH dimer to the CL-CH1 dimer. We show here that in immunoglobulins of known structure, the movement of the VL-VH dimer relative to the CL-CH1 dimer also involves the interactions of three VH and two CH1 residues that form the molecular equivalent of a ball-and-socket joint. The almost absolute conservation in the sequences of immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors of the residues that form these interactions suggests that this is a general feature of functional importance.\r"

Inhibitory and stimulatory effects on cardiac Ca2+ channels have been attributed in both cases to activation of protein kinase C. We show that the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate stimulates dihydropyridine-sensitive 45Ca2+ influx in primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes within 5 s, but that after a 20-min pre-incubation period the phorbol ester markedly inhibits 45Ca2+ influx. The sequence of stimulation followed by inhibition is confirmed in cell-attached patch clamp recordings of single Ca2+ channel currents. The stimulatory effect is faster at 0 mV than at -40 mV, leading to the novel conclusion that the rate of protein kinase C activation is modulated by the state of the Ca2+ channel.\r"

The in vivo substrates of this kinase are unknown, but phosphorylation of H1 histone can be used as an in vitro assay. We have purified this kinase from starfish oocytes. The major band in the most highly purified preparation contained a polypeptide of relative molecular mass (Mr) 34,000 (34K). This is the same size as the protein kinase encoded by cdc2+, which regulates entry into mitosis in fission yeast and is a component of MPF purified from Xenopus. Here, we show that antibodies against p34 recognize the starfish 34K protein and propose that entry into meiotic and mitotic nuclear divisions involves activation of the protein kinase encoded by a homologue of cdc2+. Given the wide occurrence of cdc2+ homologues from budding yeast to Xenopus and human cells, this activation may act as a common mechanism controlling entry into mitosis in eukaryotic cells.\r"

  ".W": "The pressing need for a better experimental system for AIDS research has brought into sharp focus the shortcomings of available animal models and the practical and ethical limitations of studies of immune responses and viral pathogenesis in humans. Current studies of the human immune responses are limited to relatively restrictive in vivo experiments and several in vitro systems that, although useful, allow only short-term studies and support responses to a few antigens. Neither model is particularly amenable to studies of the pathogenesis of diseases of the immune system. We report here that injection of human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) can result in the stable long-term reconstitution of a functional human immune system in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Human PBL transplanted to SCID mice increase in number and survive for at least six months; reconstituted mice show spontaneous secretion of human immunoglobulin and a specific human antibody response is induced following immunization with tetanus toxoid. All of the major cell populations present in PBL are found in the lymphoid tissue and blood of SCID recipients, although the relative proportions of B cells, T-cell subsets and monocytes/macrophages in long-term recipients differ from those found in normal PBL and, in mice transplanted with 50 x 10(6) or more PBL from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seropositive donors, EBV-positive B-cell lymphomas often develop. Our results suggest that xenogeneic transplantation of human lymphoid cells into SCID mice may provide a useful model for the study of normal human immune function, the response of the immune system to pathogenic agents and early events in lymphomagensis.\r"

The extraordinary polymorphism of class I MHC molecules in man (HLA-A, B and C) and mouse (H-2 K, D and L) poses many questions concerning their diversification and evolution. Comparison of allelic sequences within a species suggests diversity is generated by the assortment of point mutations into varied combinations by mechanisms of recombination and gene conversion. We have now compared class I MHC alleles in two closely related species: humans (Homo sapiens) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Chimpanzee homologues of HLA-A, HLA-B and a non-classical gene have been identified. No features distinguishing human and chimpanzee alleles could be found. Individual HLA-A or B alleles are more closely related to individual chimpanzee alleles than to other HLA-A or B alleles. These results show that a considerable proportion of contemporary HLA-A and B polymorphism existed before divergence of the chimpanzee and human lines. The stability of the polymorphism indicates that hyper-mutational mechanisms are not necessary to account for HLA-A, B and C diversity.\r"

  ".W": "The formation of the unsegmented terminal regions of the Drosophila larva, acron and telson requires the function of at least five maternal genes (terminal genes class). In their absence, the telson and acron are not formed. One of them, torso (tor), has gain-of-function alleles which have an opposite phenotype to the lack-of-function (tor-) alleles: the segmented regions of the larval body, thorax and abdomen, are missing, whereas the acron is not affected and the telson is enlarged. In strong gain-of-function mutants, the pair-rule gene fushi tarazu (ftz) is not expressed, demonstrating the suppression of the segmentation process in an early stage of development. The tor gain-of-function effect is neutralized, and segmentation is restored in double mutants with the zygotic gene tailless (tll), which has a phenotype similar (but not identical) to that of tor-. This suggests that tor acts through tll, and that in the gain-of-function alleles of tor, the tll gene product is ectopically expressed at middle positions of the embryo, where it inhibits the expression of segmentation genes like ftz.\r"

There were abnormal VEP latencies in 63% of all patients (definite and probable = 68%, possible = 50%); local or diffuse RNFL defects in 54%, (definite and probable = 54%, possible = 50%); and an abnormally small NRR area in 30% (definite and probable = 32%, possible = 25%). Abnormalities in one or more of the VEP, RNFL, or NRR area occurred in 86% of all patients (definite and probable = 90%, possible = 75%), thus considerably increasing the yield of optic nerve abnormalities over that of the VEP alone. The predominance and extent of the diffuse RNFL defects, which are axonal abnormalities, suggest a more diffuse optic nerve pathology in MS than can be accounted for by a \"plaque\" pathology and indicate that extensive axonal loss commonly occurs in the optic nerves of MS.\r"

These data suggest that (1) seizures, in ICH, occur at hemorrhage onset, (2) patients without seizures at hemorrhage onset are at very low risk for subsequent seizures during their hospitalization, (3) hemorrhage involving the cerebral cortex, regardless of site of origin, predisposes to seizures, and (4) the prophylactic use of anticonvulsants in the acute management of these patients appears unwarranted, especially in patients without cortical extension.\r"

Three patients had abnormal PEP and normal BCR, and of these, two had normal and one had abnormal nocturnal erectile activity. The validity of PEP/BCR testing was supported by normal findings in six patients with MS and without erectile problems. Nocturnal erectile activity was normal in 11 patients, of whom nine had abnormal PEP and/or BCR. A high disability score corresponded poorly with both reduced sexual function, insufficient nocturnal erectile activity, and abnormal PEP and/or BCR. Intracavernous injection of papaverine gave erection in 27 patients, the dose needed to create an erection being inversely related to the level of disablement. PEP and BCR testing may be more sensitive in defining neurogenic erectile dysfunction (ED) than nocturnal erectile activity.

  ".W": "The medical records of 229 consecutive patients with supratentorial malignant gliomas were reviewed with respect to histology, age at diagnosis, tumor location, and enhancement pattern on the CT obtained after the administration of contrast material at the time of operation. Nonenhancing tumors were identified in four (4%) of 93 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GM), three (30%) of ten with gemistocytic astrocytoma (GA), 23 (31%) of 74 with highly anaplastic astrocytoma (HAA), and 28 (54%) of 52 with moderately anaplastic astrocytoma (MoAA). The age-related incidence of the various glioma histiotypes (both enhancing and nonenhancing) was reflected by the median age at diagnosis: 50 years in GM, 52 years in GA, 40 years in HAA, and 34 years in MoAA. The age and CT contrast enhancement pattern were similar in patients with GM, GA, and MoAA; patients with nonenhancing HAAs tended to be younger at presentation. The tumor location and the frequency of enhancing and nonenhancing lesions were similar for all groups except MoAA, in which nonenhancing tumors were most often frontotemporal and enhancing tumors were usually frontoparietal. Our results demonstrate that it is important to obtain histologic confirmation of the diagnosis in patients with supratentorial gliomas regardless of the presence or absence of contrast enhancement of the tumor on CT, because neither of these characteristics correlates with the tumor histology.\r"

However, some reports suggest that the perioperative morbidity and mortality outweigh the potential benefit of the procedure. We examined prospectively morbidity and mortality in 104 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for supratentorial glioma, as well as other factors that might affect the short-term outcome. To determine if our experience was unusual, we compared these results with those obtained from another academic neurosurgical center by a review of the records of 109 patients also treated surgically for supratentorial glioma. Mortality was 3.3% and the medical plus neurologic morbidity was 31.7%. Functionally significant neurologic worsening occurred in 42 (19.7%) patients. Complications were more frequent in patients with moderate or severe preoperative disabilities than those with mild or no preoperative disability. Patients with complete resection had fewer acute neurologic complications, and no greater risk of being neurologically impaired at 1 week, than patients with biopsy or less extensive procedures. Morbidity and mortality correlated with location: deep-midline lesions had a higher overall rate of perioperative complications (p = 0.032) and mortality (p = 0.019) and bilateral lesions a higher rate of hemorrhage (p = 0.017) and hydrocephalus (p = 0.010). Older patients (greater than 55 years) and those receiving high daily dose of preoperative dexamethasone (greater than or equal to 24 mg) had a significantly higher risk of surgical mortality. Reoperation for recurrent tumor carried no greater risk of mortality, neurologic deterioration, and infection than a first operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The presence of the same autoantibody in patients with SSN, encephalomyelitis, and autonomic neuropathy suggests that these diseases are different manifestations of the same nosologic process. With one exception, treatment of the tumor, immunosuppressive drugs, and plasmapheresis did not influence the course of the neurologic illness. The autoantibody was not identified in sera from more than 400 controls subjects, including patients with SSN associated with other tumors, SSN without malignancy, other paraneoplastic syndromes, and SCLC without neurologic symptoms. The autoantibody is a highly specific marker of the paraneoplastic syndromes associated with SCLC and its detection in a patient not known to have cancer should prompt a careful search for SCLC.\r"

We also studied 72 parkinsonian patients with levodopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements to see whether early initiation of levodopa therapy affected the time of onset of abnormal involuntary movements. The results suggested that it did not, and that levodopa was started early in these patients because of the severity of their motor disability.\r"

  ".W": "Serum from 35 cases of naturally occurring acquired canine myasthenia gravis (MG) were assayed for patterns of autoantibody specificities against canine acetylcholine receptor (AChR) using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antiserum against defined regions of the AChR as competitive inhibitors of autoantibody binding. In human MG patients and in animals immunized with AChR purified from fish electric organs or mammalian muscle, most of the antibodies are directed against the main immunogenic region (MIR), a conformationally dependent region located on the extracellular surface of the alpha subunit away from the ACh binding site. In our studies using canine MG serum, we found that, as in human MG and in animals immunized with AChR, the antibody response is heterogeneous and predominantly IgG, with a large proportion of the autoantibodies directed against the MIR. The mAbs to the MIR blocked an average of 68% of serum antibody binding. A mAb to the beta subunit and polyclonal antiserum to the gamma subunit blocked an average of 34% and 39% of serum antibody binding, respectively, indicating that these subunits also contain relevant antigenic determinants, a pattern that has also been observed in human MG serum. Anti-alpha bungarotoxin binding site antibodies made up only a small fraction of the autoantibody population in canine MG as in human MG. These and other features described here suggest that canine MG is a useful model of human MG.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the concentration of the neuropeptide somatostatin (SOM) in the CSF of patients with several neurologic diseases. Since SOM is localized in high concentrations in primary sensory pathways, such as the dorsal root ganglia and dorsal horn of the spinal cord, it might be involved in conditions of chronic pain due to functional alterations of nociceptive neurons, such as postinfectious zoster neuralgia. Our study indicated a marked elevation of SOM in patients suffering from postzoster neuralgia compared with controls. Comparison with other neurologic diseases revealed decreased CSF SOM levels in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, unchanged values in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and increased concentrations in patients with brain tumors. In neurodegenerative disorders, SOM levels in CSF seemed to reflect the anatomic distribution as well as a reduction or preservation of the peptide in certain brain areas affected by the disease process. In postzoster patients, postinfectious degeneration of dorsal root ganglia cells might cause deafferentation of dorsal horn neurons and activation of SOM-containing systems with increased release either locally from neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord or from descending fiber projections. The results suggested that SOM may take part in the modulation of nociceptive responses.\r"

Forty-seven percent of patients reported moderate or greater relief with amitriptyline, 16% with placebo, and 15% with lorazepam. Mean amitriptyline dose was 65 mg/d. Greater relief was associated with higher amitriptyline doses, up to the maximum dose of 150 mg/d, and with higher serum tricyclic levels.

The 10-, 20-, and 30-year survival rates were respectively 96%, 80%, and 61%, suggesting a better prognosis than previously reported. Survival of FD patients was poorer than expected from the general population. Survival for males was poorer than for females even after adjustment for expected survival. Age of onset was not a significant prognostic factor. Survival for patients diagnosed in 1960 or later was better than for those diagnosed before 1960; however, the difference was not statistically significant.\r"

The preoperative neuropsychological evaluations revealed specific cognitive deficits of varying degree. The patients showed frontal lobe-type deficits with alterations in behavioral programming leading to difficulties in the organization of motor sequences and alternating programs. They also showed memory disorders and visuospatial and visuoperceptual deficiences such as a loss of figure-ground perspective and fragmentation. Postoperative evaluations, carried out 3 months after neurosurgery, revealed a significant amelioration of the frontal lobe-type symptoms and visuospatial deficits, as well as an improvement in memory tasks that require an active organization of the response. Immediate and delayed memory difficulties remained unchanged. These observations were compared to neuropsychological data obtained from neurologically intact subjects and from unoperated PD patients. The improvements of the operated PD patients resulted in performance levels close to normal values and clearly distinguishable from those of unoperated PD patients, and were unrelated to improved mood, increased alertness, or sustained attention. Autotransplantation of adrenal medullary tissue to the caudate nucleus of PD patients showing a decreased effective response to L-dopa therapy can partially restore motor functions and frontal-type cognitive symptoms.\r"

Our results showed that polyclonal IgM anti-GM1 antibodies were present at dilutions of 1:25 to 1:2,000 in 42 of 74 (57%) patients with ALS. The anti-GM1 antibodies were especially frequent in patients with prominent lower motor neuron signs (41/59; 69%). Few normal controls (2/23) and motor-sensory neuropathy patients (3/27) had similar antibodies. Anti-GM1 antibodies did occur in patients with nonneural autoimmune disorders. However, the anti-GM1 antibodies in these patients tended to differ from those in ALS based on an analysis of their light chain types. Further examination of the role and spectrum of serum antiganglioside antibody activity in motor neuron syndromes is warranted.\r"

We found decreases of over 50% in the concentration of TRH receptors in lamina IX of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord from ALS patients. Similar reductions were noted in concentrations of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in lamina IX of spinal cords from ALS patients. Significant increases of up to 140% in 5-HT1A receptor densities were noted in lamina IX of spinal cords from ALS patients. No differences were noted between the concentrations of beta-adrenergic receptors or norepinephrine uptake sites in patients with ALS and controls. These findings suggest that TRH and 5-HT may be involved in the pathophysiology of ALS, and act in a comodulatory role in the normal spinal cord.\r"

The findings are explained by compression of the facial colliculus, with involvement of the sixth nerve nucleus and the middle cerebellar peduncle. Two patients were hypertensive; one was normotensive, and no etiology was identified with angiography. Of 40 patients with cerebellar hemorrhage seen at our institution, only those with medial cerebellar peduncular hematomas demonstrated this clinical triad, and we have not seen this clinical triad in other pathologic conditions.

  ".W": "The intraocular pressure (IOP) course during the first 2 months after cataract surgery in patients with preexisting glaucoma was evaluated in 25 consecutive cases of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) implantation and in 25 cases of intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) without IOL implantation. Although the former group had a slightly more favorable postoperative IOP course, approximately half of each group had a pressure rise above 21 mm Hg on the first day postoperatively, and approximately 80% had an IOP rise during the first postoperative month. These findings support the position that all glaucoma patients require close monitoring of their IOPs immediately after both ECCE and ICCE, and that patients with moderate to advanced glaucomatous damage should probably have glaucoma surgery either before or in combination with their cataract operation.\r"

A postoperative rise of 8 mm Hg above baseline or above 23 mm Hg was observed in 149 eyes (29%). Secondary glaucoma well controlled medically developed in 21 eyes (4%). Three eyes developed glaucoma after the first year postoperatively. Therefore, over the total follow-up period of 6 years, 24 eyes (4.7%) developed pseudophakic glaucoma. None, however, required laser or other surgical intervention. These results further support the prevailing view that ECCE with PC-IOL is the procedure of choice.\r"

The only complications during photocoagulation were petectal intra- and preretinal hemorrhages, which absorbed after a few days. Complications after treatment were limited to epiretinal membrane formation in the macular area in four eyes (0.2%). The applied laser energy in three of these four eyes was significantly greater (mean 34.4 mJ) than in the total 2,000 eyes (mean 7.2 mJ). This finding supports the observation by other authors that extensive photocoagulation is associated with an increased incidence of epiretinal membrane formation.\r"

An animal study was undertaken to learn whether treatment with the aqueous humor suppressants, acetazolamide, and timolol prolongs the concentrations of antibiotics in the aqueous humor after subconjunctival administration of the antibiotic. Treatment with acetazolamide significantly increased concentrations of piperacillin; it had less consistent effects on tobramycin levels. Timolol treatment did not produce increased piperacillin concentrations at six hours; however, concentrations at 12 and 24 hours were significantly higher than in the controls. Timolol treatment increased tobramycin concentrations only at six hours. The combined use of timolol and acetazolamide produced significantly higher concentrations of piperacillin, but not of tobramycin.\r"

The fully deprotected tRNA analogue was characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sizing), terminal nucleotide analysis, sequencing, and total enzyme degradation, all of which indicated that the sequence was correct and contained only 3-5 linkages. The 77-mer was then assayed for amino acid acceptor activity by using E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase. The results indicated that the synthetic product, lacking modified bases, is a substrate for the enzyme and has an amino acid acceptance 11% of that of the major native species, tRNA(fMet) containing 7-methylguanosine at position 47.\r"

The complete coding sequence contains 7035 bases; it encodes a polypeptide chain of 2345 amino acids having a Mr of 265,220. The sequences of several CNBr peptides of Ac-CoA carboxylase were localized within the predicted protein sequence as were those peptides that contain the sites for phosphorylation. The deduced protein contains one putative site for biotinylation in the NH2-terminal half. The \"conserved\" biotinylation site peptide, Met-Lys-Met, is preceded by valine, whereas alanine is found in a similar position in all other known biotin-containing proteins. The primary sequences of Ac-CoA carboxylase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase exhibit substantial identity.\r"

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes dexamethasone increases, whereas insulin as well as N6,O2'-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate decrease, glutamine synthetase gene expression. We analyzed the nucleotide sequence of a 1.9-kilobase Sal I-EcoRI restriction fragment from a 3T3-L1 glutamine synthetase genomic clone. This genomic fragment is composed of 1851 base pairs (bp) and includes the first exon and 1029 bp of the 5' flanking sequence. The 600 bp at the 3' end of the 1.9-kb Sal I-EcoRI restriction fragment constitute an open reading frame. We identified the transcription start site at a location 222 bp upstream of the glutamine synthetase coding sequences. The 5' flanking region of the gene encompasses several potential regulatory elements including TATA and CAAT sequences and a 40-bp poly(dT-dG).poly(dC-dA) putative enhancer element. Potential hormone and fat-specific regulatory elements are also located upstream of the transcription start site; they include glucocorticoid and cAMP response elements and fat-specific elements. These potential regulatory elements could account for the differentiation-associated changes and hormone-mediated changes seen in glutamine synthetase gene transcription and mRNA abundance.\r"

The regulation of 5 alpha-reductase expression has not been studied at the molecular level as the enzyme is a membrane protein that is labile in cell-free homogenates. We developed a sensitive bioassay of the enzyme activity expressed in Xenopus oocytes microinjected with rat liver and prostate mRNA. After microinjection, incubation of intact oocytes in the presence of [3H]testosterone revealed the in ovo appearance of active 5 alpha-reductase. Polyadenylated RNA was fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and the enzymatic activity was shown to be encoded by a 1600- to 2000-base-pair fraction of hepatic poly(A)+ RNA. 5 alpha-Reductase mRNA was most efficiently translated when up to 80 ng of RNA was injected per oocyte. In the injected oocytes, 5 alpha-reductase mRNA was found to be a short-lived molecule (t1/2 = 2 hr), whereas its in ovo translatable 5 alpha-reductase protein exhibited stable enzymatic activity for over 40 hr. Moreover, the levels of translatable tissue-specific 5 alpha-reductase mRNAs as monitored in the Xenopus oocytes correlated with the variable 5 alpha-reductase activities in female rat liver, male rat liver, and prostate homogenates; the ratio of their specific activities was of 2500:630:1, respectively. Altogether, these results provide supporting evidence in favor of the transcriptional control of 5 alpha-reductase expression in rat tissues.\r"

The primary structures of the a and b subunits of human factor XIII have been reported by a combination of cDNA cloning and amino acid sequence analysis. To establish the gene structure of the a subunit for factor XIII, several human genomic libraries were screened by using the cDNA encoding the a subunit as a probe. Among approximately equal to 5 x 10(7) recombinant phage, 121 have been shown to contain an insert encoding a portion of the a subunit. Twenty-five unique clones were then characterized by restriction mapping, Southern blotting, and DNA sequencing. Overlapping clones encoding the a subunit of factor XIII span greater than 160 kilobases. The gene was found to contain 15 exons separated by 14 introns. All the sequences of the introns at the intron-exon boundaries were GT-AG, which are the same as those found in other eukaryotic genes. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the activation peptide released by thrombin, the active site cysteine region, the two putative calcium-binding regions, and the thrombin cleavage site leading to inactivation are encoded by separate exons. This suggests that the introns may separate the a subunit into functional and structural domains. A comparison of the amino acid sequence deduced from the genomic DNA sequence with those deduced from cDNA or determined by amino acid sequence analysis of the plasma and placental proteins revealed apparent amino acid polymorphisms in six positions of the polypeptide chain of the a subunit.\r"

Although the rates of hydrolysis are very slow compared to the forward phosphorylation rates under optimal conditions, they are of the same order as the reverse reaction in the presence of ADP. Because cells contain approximately equal to 3 mM ATP, neither the reverse reaction nor the phosphatase is likely to play a physiological role. beta-casein B phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) is specifically dephosphorylated by protein kinase A but not by polypeptide-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase P). beta-casein B phosphorylated by protein kinase P is specifically dephosphorylated by protein kinase P but not by protein kinase A. Histone H1 phosphorylated by protein kinase C is dephosphorylated by the same enzyme in the absence of ADP. In all cases tested addition of ADP and F1-ATPase accelerates moderately the rate of dephosphorylation. Native H+-ATPase from yeast plasma membranes is isolated mainly in the phosphorylated form. It is dephosphorylated and rephosphorylated by protein kinase P but not by protein kinase A. Protein-tyrosine kinase of the epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylates the random synthetic polypeptide poly(Glu80Tyr20). The phosphorylated polymer is specifically dephosphorylated in the absence of ADP by epidermal growth factor receptor preparations but not by insulin receptor preparations. The same polymer phosphorylated by insulin receptor is dephosphorylated by insulin receptor but not by epidermal growth factor receptor preparations. By using a cycle of dephosphorylation-rephosphorylation, it is possible to identify proteins that are phosphorylated by these protein kinases in vivo. Should this method be applicable to additional protein kinases, it should be possible to estimate the quantitative contribution of each protein kinase to a single phosphoprotein.\r"

  ".W": "Transcription of the drug-metabolizing cytochrome P-450c gene is induced by 3-methylcholanthrene or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Previously, we defined two xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs) of approximately equal to 15 base pairs, both of which activate transcription in cis in response to these xenobiotics. Using a gel mobility shift assay, we have identified a factor that specifically binds to the XREs. This factor appears in nuclei of mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa-1 only when the cells are treated with the xenobiotics, while the factor is undetectable in the nuclei of a 3-methylcholanthrene-treated mutant of Hepa-1 with defective function of a xenobiotic receptor. In addition, the nuclear factor bound to the XRE in the gel was found to be associated with [3H]TCDD when the cells were treated with it, suggesting that the xenobiotic receptor is at least a component of the DNA-binding factor. The cytoplasmic fraction from nontreated Hepa-1 cells also contains the factor as a cryptic form and prominently reveals its DNA-binding activity by incubation with 3-methylcholanthrene in vitro. These results not only suggest the involvement of the XRE-binding factor in transcriptional activation via XREs but also provide evidence that the binding of ligands to the preexisting factor in a cryptic form induces its XRE-binding activity, which is probably followed by its translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus.\r"

Binding of nuclear factors to the ICS was studied in gel mobility shift assays with the 5' upstream region of the murine H-2Ld gene. We found that the ICS binds a constitutive nuclear factor present in lymphocytes and fibroblasts regardless of IFN treatment. Within 1 hr after IFN treatment, new ICS binding activity was induced, which consisted of at least two binding activities distinguished by their requirement for de novo protein synthesis. Methylation interference and competition experiments showed that both constitutive and induced factors bind to the same approximately equal to 10-base-pair binding site within the ICS. Site-directed mutagenesis of H-2Ld-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes showed that mutations in the binding site, but not in other regions of the ICS, abolish transcriptional activation of class I genes by IFN, providing evidence that specific binding of nuclear factors to the ICS is an essential requirement for transcriptional induction. Finally, we show that IFN-inducible genes of various species share a sequence motif that is capable of competing for the nuclear factors identified here. We propose that specific protein binding to the conserved motif represents a basic mechanism of IFN-mediated transcriptional induction of a number of genes.\r"

Upon transfection into a hamster fibroblast cell line K12, the hybrid gene exhibits cell-cycle-dependent expression. Deletion analysis reveals that the region important for cell-cycle regulation is within -441 to -63 nucleotides from the transcriptional initiation site. This region (-441 to -63) also confers cell-cycle regulation to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) promoter, which is not expressed in a cell-cycle manner. We conclude that the -441 to -63 sequence within the human TK promoter is important for cell-cycle-dependent expression.\r"

The function of the stable class of MTs is unknown and has been confounded by the apparent lack of organization of stable MTs within cells. Using an antibody against detyrosinated tubulin, a post-translationally modified form of tubulin that accumulates in stable MTs, we localized the stable MTs in mouse 3T3 cells induced to initiate directional migration by experimental wounding of confluent monolayers. Immediately after monolayer wounding, the distribution of stable MTs in cells at the wound edge resembled that in cells in the monolayer interior; most cells either contained randomly distributed stable MTs or lacked them entirely. However, by 20 min after wounding, cells at the wound margin began to generate an asymmetric MT array, with virtually all stable MTs oriented toward the cell edge in contact with the wound. Two hours after monolayer wounding, greater than or equal to 80% of cells at the wound margin had generated this polarized array of stable MTs, and the array was maintained for at least 12 hr. MTs in the polarized array showed enhanced resistance to depolymerization by nocodazole, thus providing an independent test of their stability. Formation of the polar array of stable MTs appeared to precede onset of cell migration and closely paralleled reorientation of the MT-organizing center. These results show that cultured cells can remodel their MT array rapidly in response to an extracellular signal and suggest that selective stabilization of MTs is an early event in the generation of cellular asymmetry.\r"

Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with a plasmid containing a replication-defective simian virus 40 (SV40) genome. Colonies of cells with enhanced growth potential were isolated and analyzed for transformation- and epithelial-specific characteristics. Precrisis cells were observed to express the SV40 large tumor antigen, produce cytokeratins, have microvilli, and form tight junctions. After crisis, cells continued to express the SV40 large tumor antigen as well as epithelial-specific cytokeratins and to display the apical membrane microvilli. Apical membrane Cl channels were opened in postcrisis cells exposed to 50 microM forskolin. These channels showed electrical properties similar to those observed in primary cultures. The postcrisis cells have been in culture for greater than 250 generations and are potentially \"immortal.\" In addition to providing a useful in vitro model for the study of ion transport by human airway epithelial cells, the cells can be used to examine stages of neoplastic progression.\r"

The response is strongly dose dependent with a maximum in the ng/ml concentration range and, for some cell lines, a marked decrease at concentrations greater than 1 ng/ml; e.g., arterial endothelial cells respond weakly to angiogenin concentrations comparable to that in normal human plasma (approximately equal to 400 ng/ml). Chemical modification of the active site of angiogenin or inhibition with placental ribonuclease inhibitor abolishes its activation of endothelial cell phospholipase C; this correlates with the concomitant loss of both intrinsic ribonucleolytic and angiogenic activity. The response to low concentrations of angiogenin is consistent with its potency of inducing vascularization in classical angiogenesis assays. In vivo, endothelial cells are exposed to concentrations of angiogenin higher than that required to elicit a cellular response; it seems likely, therefore, that expression of a surface receptor or some other process must be rate limiting in the cellular response.\r"

The furrow contained bundles of actin filaments of opposite polarities oriented parallel to the long axis of the furrow; these bundles may be the main component of the contractile arc. From electron microscopic observation of thin sections of the furrow, it was suggested that the actin bundles of the contractile arc were organized from preexisting cortical filaments that were connected to the plasma membrane by granular materials at their barbed ends. Contractile-arc actin filaments were revealed to be crosslinked by thin strands by the rapid freezing/deep etching-replication technique. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that several proteins found in the furrow cortex are absent from the cortical layer before the cleavage furrow is formed.\r"

We show that cortisol elicits GS mRNA accumulation by stimulating transcription of the GS gene and that this stimulation requires cell contacts: in dissociated and separated retina cells GS gene transcription was not induced; when the separated cells were reassembled into multicellular aggregates, restoring cell contacts, accumulation of GS mRNA was again inducible. In cells dissociated from retina tissue that had been preinduced with cortisol, GS gene transcription rapidly declined, despite continued hormone availability. In the separated cells transcription of the histone H3.3 gene and accumulation of carbonic anhydrase II mRNA were unaffected; therefore, cell separation selectively precluded induction of the GS gene. These findings provide direct evidence for the regulatory role of cell contacts in hormonal control of gene transcription.\r"

Field and laboratory tests showed that the alkaloids protect eggs from predators.

  ".W": "The alphaviruses are a group of 26 mosquito-borne viruses that cause a variety of human diseases. Many of the New World alphaviruses cause encephalitis, whereas the Old World viruses more typically cause fever, rash, and arthralgia. The genome is a single-stranded nonsegmented RNA molecule of + polarity; it is about 11,700 nucleotides in length. Several alphavirus genomes have been sequenced in whole or in part, and these sequences demonstrate that alpha-viruses have descended from a common ancestor by divergent evolution. We have now obtained the sequence of the 3'-terminal 4288 nucleotides of the RNA of the New World Alphavirus western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV). Comparisons of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of WEEV with those of other alphaviruses clearly show that WEEV is recombinant. The sequences of the capsid protein and of the (untranslated) 3'-terminal 80 nucleotides of WEEV are closely related to the corresponding sequences of the New World Alphavirus eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), whereas the sequences of glycoproteins E2 and E1 of WEEV are more closely related to those of an Old World virus, Sindbis virus. Thus, WEEV appears to have arisen by recombination between an EEEV-like virus and a Sindbis-like virus to give rise to a new virus with the encephalogenic properties of EEEV but the antigenic specificity of Sindbis virus. There has been speculation that recombination might play an important role in the evolution of RNA viruses. The current finding that a widespread and successful RNA virus is recombinant provides support for such an hypothesis.\r"

Whereas all normal tissues and many tumor cells express an RB mRNA of 4.7 kilobases, six of six retinoblastomas were previously found either to lack RB gene expression or to have RB transcripts of abnormal (reduced) length. To further characterize the latter type of mutation, we chose to examine retinoblastoma cell line Y79, which expressed a shortened RB mRNA of about 4.0 kilobases. RB cDNA clones isolated from a library constructed with Y79 mRNA demonstrated an internal loss of 470 nucleotides near the 5' end, which corresponded to a deletion of exons 2-6. Genomic clones containing the deletion junction were isolated from a library made with Y79 DNA, which allowed precise localization and sequencing of deletion endpoints in introns 1 and 6. These regions had no apparent homology to each other or to the Alu family of repetitive sequences, implying that the deletion must have occurred by a mechanism other than recombination of homologous sequences. Deletion of exons 2-6 would interrupt the open reading frame in RB mRNA and would result in premature termination of translation. Since no normal RB protein was detected by immunoprecipitation with specific antibody, the other, apparently normal RB allele in Y79 cells was necessarily inactivated by a different mutation.\r"

Purified omega transposase generates in vitro a 4-base-pair staggered cut with 3' hydroxyl overhangs at the exact position where the intron eventually inserts in the gene. Using randomly mutagenized synthetic oligonucleotides, single-base mutants were produced at 21 positions around the cleavage site. Experiments with these oligonucleotides show that the recognition site extends over an 18-base pair-long sequence within which minimal sequence degeneracy is tolerated. The intron-encoded omega transposase is, therefore, one of the most specific restriction endonucleases known to date.\r"

This led to the conclusion that the phenotype of cellular senescence is dominant and that immortal cells arise as a result of recessive changes in the growth control mechanisms of the normal cell. We have exploited the fact that immortality is recessive and, by fusing immortal human cell lines with each other, assigned 21 cell lines to at least four complementation groups for indefinite division. A wide variety of cell lines was included in the study to determine what parameters, if any, would affect complementation group assignment. The results indicate that cell type, embryonal layer of origin, and type of tumor do not affect group assignment. There does not appear to be any correlation between expression of an activated oncogene and group assignment. However, all of the immortal simian virus 40-transformed cell lines studied (with the exception of one xerodermapigmentosum fibroblast-derived line) assign to the same group, indicating that this virus immortalizes various human cells by the same processes. The assignment of immortal human cells to distinct groups provides the basis for a focused approach to determine the genes important in normal growth regulation that have been modified in immortal cells.\r"

Disomic spores produced by the red1-1 mutant contain nonsister chromatids and the red1-1 spore inviability phenotype is alleviated in red1-1 spo13 double mutants; these results indicate that nondisjunction occurs at the first meiotic division. The red1-1 mutant is recombination-proficient. The RED1 gene was cloned by complementation of the meiotic lethal phenotype; strains carrying a disruption of the gene are mitotically viable. We propose that the RED1 gene product is involved in meiosis I chromosome disjunction, perhaps by maintaining the connections between homologous chromosomes through metaphase I.\r"

Several parameters were varied to enhance infection frequency of colony-forming units, spleen (CFU-S); overall 41% of 116 foci studied contained an intact proviral genome. The human beta-globin gene was expressed in 31 of 35 CFU-S-derived spleen colonies that contained the intact vector genome at levels ranging from 1% to 5% of that of the mouse beta-globin genes.

  ".W": "A fundamental question in microtubule research is how the interactions of tubulin subunits with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are controlled. The answer should provide insight into the regulation of the cellular processes in which microtubules are implicated. Previous work demonstrated the interaction of MAPs with a 4-kDa C-terminal domain of tubulin alpha and beta subunits. Synthetic peptides from the variable region of the 4-kDa C-terminal moiety of tubulin subunits, alpha-(430-441) and beta-(422-434), bind to MAP-2 and to the MAP tau, and a preferential interaction of the beta peptide is observed. To define the regulatory significance of the substructure of the C-terminal tubulin domain, we produced rabbit antisera against these MAP-interacting peptides. We found that these antisera contained not only antibodies to the original synthetic peptides but also antibodies to MAPs. Here, we report that these antibodies, which react with MAP-1, MAP-2, and tau, appear to be a population of anti-idiotypic antibodies directed to the anti-peptide antibodies. They can inhibit MAP-induced tubulin assembly into microtubules in vitro, and the addition of MAPs overcomes the inhibition. The recognition by these anti-idiotypic antibodies of the tubulin-binding domain on MAPs provides unequivocal evidence that the tubulin region defined by the synthetic peptides is directly involved in the interaction with MAPs.\r"

There is one delta-chain constant region gene (C delta) located approximately equal to 85 kilobases (kb) upstream of the alpha-chain constant region. The delta-chain constant region consists of four exons, whose organization is very similar to that of the C alpha exons, suggesting that C alpha and C delta may have arisen from a gene duplication event. The first exon encodes most of the extracellular constant domain, the second encodes a hinge-like region, and the third encodes the entire transmembrane segment and intracytoplasmic portion, whereas the last exon contains exclusively 3' untranslated sequences. Three joining segments, J delta 1, J delta 2, and J delta 3, are found approximately equal to 12, approximately equal to 5.7, and approximately equal to 3.4 kb upstream of the first exon of C delta. Two functional diversity gene segments, D delta 1 and D delta 2, which can be productively translated in all three reading frames, are found 1 and 9.6 kb upstream of J delta 1. The presence of two D delta with such potential for diversity may offset the limited repertoire of the J delta and V delta genes. The spacer distribution in the recombinational signals flanking D delta and J delta segments allows recombination with V alpha gene segments; however, examination of delta-chain messages does not indicate that this is the case, suggesting that the delta chain uses unique variable gene segments and raising the question as to the reasons for this phenomenon.\r"

This method utilizes exhaustively acetylated low density lipoprotein (acetyl-LDL) to deliver the lipophilic immunomodulator, muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PtdEtn; amide composed of N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamyl-L-alanine and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine) to macrophages (M phi) by means of a scavenger lipoprotein receptor pathway. The binding of acetyl-LDL:MTP-PtdEtn to M phi showed specificity since minimal competition was observed in the presence of excess native LDL or phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes. Additional binding studies showed that acetyl-LDL may serve as a suitable delivery vehicle to a wide variety of M phi in different stages of activation. Cytostatic and tumoricidal activities by thioglycolate-elicited M phi against two tumor cell lines were examined in vitro following incubation with the acetyl-LDL:MTP-PtdEtn complex. Cytostatic activity against B16F10 melanoma cells was induced after the incubation of thioglycolate-elicited M phi with a minimum of 25 micrograms of acetyl-LDL protein containing 2.5 micrograms of bound MTP-PtdEtn (approximately equal to 40 molecules per particle of acetyl-LDL). The induction of cytostasis was not affected by liposome bilayers, which were also endocytosed by the M phi. In addition, tumoricidal activity against P815 mastocytoma cells was demonstrated at a 40:1 effector-to-target ratio using 18 micrograms of the acetyl-LDL:MTP-PtdEtn complex containing 3.6 micrograms of MTP-PtdEtn (approximately equal to 80 molecules per particle). These studies describe a method for the induction of antitumor activity by use of a chemically modified serum component, acetyl-LDL, to direct lipophilic immunomodulators to M phi.\r"

Studies utilizing freeze-etch electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, 31P NMR, x-ray diffraction, and optical spectroscopy revealed that this toxicity attenuation is related to the macromolecular structure of the complexes in a definable fashion.

  ".W": "Chronic renal disease is frequently characterized by anemia, which may modify systemic and renal hemodynamics. In adult Munich-Wistar rats, the mild anemia (hematocrit, approximately equal to 42 vol/dl) that accompanies five-sixths nephrectomy was either made more severe (approximately equal to 30 vol/dl) by feeding a low iron diet or prevented (approximately equal to 50 vol/dl) by administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEpo). In functional studies performed 4 weeks after renal ablation, untreated rats exhibited mild anemia with systemic hypertension and elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate due to glomerular capillary hyperperfusion and hypertension. Preventing anemia with r-HuEpo worsened systemic and glomerular hypertension, effects largely obviated by induction of more marked anemia with the low iron diet. Untreated rats followed for 6 weeks postablation exhibited progressive proteinuria and sclerosis involving 12% of glomeruli, contrasted with 33% in rats given r-HuEpo. Even after 12 weeks, sclerosis involved only 6% of glomeruli in rats with more severe anemia but progressed to 30% in untreated rats. Thus, anemia limits systemic and glomerular hypertension and glomerular injury, whereas its prevention by r-HuEpo severely accelerates hemodynamically mediated glomerular injury in this model. These results suggest that anemia is a hemodynamically favorable adaptation to chronic renal disease and that its overly vigorous correction may have adverse renal hemodynamic and structural consequences.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested that the canalicular bile salt transport system of rat liver corresponds to a 100-kDa membrane glycoprotein. In the present study we attempted to functionally reconstitute the 100-kDa protein into artificial proteoliposomes. Canalicular membrane proteins were solubilized with octyl glucoside in the presence of asolectin phospholipids. The extracts were treated with preimmune serum or the 100-kDa protein selectively immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antiserum. Proteins remaining in the supernatant were then incorporated into proteoliposomes by gel-filtration chromatography. Canalicular proteoliposomes containing the 100-kDa protein exhibited transstimulatable taurocholate uptake that could be inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS). In contrast, no DIDS-sensitive transstimulatable taurocholate uptake was found in 100-kDa protein-free canalicular proteoliposomes. However, when the immunoprecipitated 100-kDa protein was dissociated from the antibodies and exclusively incorporated into liposomes, reconstitution of DIDS-sensitive transstimulatable and electrogenic taurocholate anion transport was again positive. Although incorporation of solubilized basolateral membrane proteins into liposomes also resulted in a prompt reconstitution of Na+ gradient-driven taurocholate uptake, the anti-100-kDa antibodies had no effects on the reconstituted transport activity of basolateral proteins. Thus, the findings establish that the previously characterized canalicular-specific 100-kDa protein is directly involved in the transcanalicular secretion of bile salts.\r"

To examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. Radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. The classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain Escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-GM1 (Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Cer), asialo-GM1 (Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta-1-4Galc beta 1-1Cer), and asialo-GM2 (GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer). Bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. They do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, Forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and Cad. The finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked GalNAc, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-GM1 and asialo-GM1 and terminally in asialo-GM2, is required for binding. beta-N-Acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence GalNAc beta 1-3Gal. These data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. Other bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella species, and some E. coli, dod not bind to the GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequence. The biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-GM1 occur in human lung tissue.\r"

  ".W": "The differentiation of bipotential precursors of oligodendrocytes (OL) and type-2 astrocytes (AS) was followed in primary cultures from 8-day postnatal rat cerebellum by labeling the cells with the antibodies LB1 (which binds to the surface disialoganglioside GD3 present in glial precursors, type-2 AS, and immature OL), O4 (a marker of immature and mature OL binding to surface sulfatide), anti-galactocerebroside (GalCer, a marker of OL), and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a marker of AS). Two hours after plating, hardly any LB1+, GFAP+ cells were detectable, 40% of the O4+ cells were GalCer+, and none of the O4+ cells were GFAP+. Upon culturing cells plated at a density of 1 x 10(5) cells per cm2 in the presence of fetal calf serum, most of the LB1+ precursors differentiated into type-2 AS, even if most of them had already expressed the O4 antigen. Thus, in culture, most type-2 AS seem to derive from progenitor cells that were differentiating in vivo into OL. In higher density cultures (2.5 x 10(5) cells per cm2), however, many precursors differentiated into GalCer+ OL, rather than into AS. As a possible source of the signals responsible for the behavior of the glial precursors in high-density cultures, we focused our attention on type-1 AS, the most abundant cell type in the cultures. We found that, in low-density cultures maintained for 5-7 days in a medium conditioned by type-1 AS, the proliferation of the precursors was enhanced and their differentiation into OL or AS was prevented. In contrast, when cerebellar cells were coplated with type-1 AS dissociated from purified cultures, not only did the precursors proliferate more than in control cultures, but also a larger proportion of them differentiated into GalCer+ OL. In conclusion, type-1 AS appear to facilitate the differentiation of bipotential glial precursors into OL through direct cell-cell interactions. The influence of type-1 AS on the differentiation of the LB1+ and O4+ precursors is supported also by experiments with glial cortical cultures.\r"

  ".W": "A model system that consists of a muscle utilized in biting, the accessory radula closer (ARC), and the two cholinergic motor neurons innervating this muscle, neurons B15 and B16, has been used to study the expression of food-induced arousal in the marine mollusk Aplysia. The ARC muscle receives modulatory input from an extrinsic source, the serotonergic metacerebral cells, which partially accounts for the progressive increase in the strength of biting seen in aroused animals. Another source of modulation may arise from the ARC motor neurons themselves, which synthesize neuropeptides that can potentiate ARC contractions. Neuron B15 synthesizes the two homologous peptides, small cardioactive peptides A and B, whereas neuron B16 synthesizes the structurally unrelated peptide myomodulin. Here we report the purification and sequencing of a neuropeptide termed buccalin and show that it is colocalized with the small cardioactive peptides to neuron B15. Buccalin is also bioactive at the ARC neuromuscular junction but, in contrast to the small cardioactive peptides, when exogenously applied, it decreases rather than increases the size of muscle contractions elicited by firing of the motor neurons. Also unlike the small cardioactive peptides, which exert postsynaptic actions, buccalin seems to act only presynaptically. It has no effect on muscle relaxation rate and decreases motor neuron-elicited excitatory junction potentials in the ARC without affecting contractions produced by direct application of acetylcholine to the muscle. Neuron B15, therefore, appears to contain three modulatory neurotransmitters, two of which may act postsynaptically on the muscle to potentiate the action of the primary neurotransmitter acetylcholine and one of which may act presynaptically on nerve terminals to inhibit acetylcholine release.\r"

Analysis of the resulting staining patterns allowed us to evaluate the amounts and distribution of amyloid-protein deposits exclusive of other senile-plaque components. Previously unappreciated infra-structural details of amyloid in the Alzheimer disease brain became accessible through computer-enhanced imaging procedures. Four discrete morphologic classes of amyloid deposits were observed and classified as punctate, macular, ring, and ring-with-core configurations. Computer imaging indicated that all four classes of immunostained deposits contain internal gradients of density. The classes were nonuniformly distributed with regard to size and location within cortical laminae. Our results support two separate but complementary hypotheses concerning the molecular neuropathology of Alzheimer disease in the prefrontal cortex. (i) Irrespective of cortical layer or morphology, density-gradient analyses suggest that amyloid deposits are elaborated through molecular and cellular events that may involve diffusion or coalescence of the A4 polypeptide. (ii) The distribution and morphology of prefrontal cortical amyloid deposits may be dependent upon underlying laminar-specific structures of the neocortex.\r"

In rabbit retina, cholinergic amacrine and displaced amacrine cells were identified by immunohistochemical staining for the enzyme choline acetyltransferase and by their avid accumulation of the fluorescent dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Several GABA-immunoreactive and glutamate decarboxylase-immunoreactive cell types, including a prominent population of small, round amacrine and displaced amacrine cells, were also identified. Double-label experiments demonstrated that all amacrine and displaced amacrine cells that prominently accumulate 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole contain GABA and glutamate decarboxylase immunoreactivity. However, not all GABA-immunoreactive cells accumulate this dye. Quantitative analysis of the ganglion cell layer of whole mount preparations of the retina showed that choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive cells and the majority of GABA-immunoreactive cells have a small, round shape and similar cell density profiles that parallel that of displaced amacrine cells. These studies establish that cholinergic cells are a major subpopulation of GABA-immunoreactive amacrine and displaced amacrine cells. The role these cells have in the formation of ganglion cell receptive-field properties may be parsimoniously explained by an excitatory postsynaptic action mediated by acetylcholine and an inhibitory presynaptic action mediated by GABA.\r"

Since transsynaptic activity is known to regulate ontogeny of postsynaptic transmitter enzymes, we initially studied the developing ganglion. Denervation in neonates prevented normal development, decreasing calmodulin binding to the ganglionic PSDp by 71% after 4 weeks. During this period, denervation elicited only a 42% decrease in total protein of the synaptic membrane fraction, suggesting that innervation regulates development of various synaptic components differentially. Effects of denervation were extremely rapid, resulting in a 44% decrease in calmodulin binding within 1 day, consistent with regulation by a signaling process such as impulse activity. The effect of impulse activity was examined more directly in adults by treatment with the agents reserpine or phenoxybenzamine, which elicit reflex increases in sympathetic transmission. Administration of reserpine resulted in a progressive 90% increase in calmodulin binding to the PSDp over 4 weeks. Phenoxybenzamine also elicited an increase, mimicking the effects of reserpine. Neither agent altered total protein of the synaptic membrane fraction, suggesting that impulse activity regulates specific synaptic components. Finally, ganglionic denervation in adults decreased PSDp binding within 12 hr, consistent with acute effects of impulse reduction. Our results suggest that transsynaptic impulse activity plays an important role in regulation of specific molecular components of the synapse.\r"

No significant effect of glycyl-L-glutamine could be demonstrated 4 or 6 days after denervation. These findings are consistent with the conclusion, drawn from a previous in vitro study, that glycyl-L-glutamine acts at a stage prior to the aggregation of the G1 form into higher polymers to maintain the acetylcholinesterase content of denervated ganglia.

The Cl- content of granules and cytoplasm decreased and a bromide gradient (granule greater than cytoplasm) was established during incubation in low-chloride, NaBr-containing solutions. Scanning confocal fluorescence light microscopy of live atria incubated with acridine orange demonstrated dye accumulation, indicative of low intragranular pH. We conclude that the granules represent a hitherto unrecognized intracellular store of cardiac calcium and can develop and maintain an anion gradient, presumably through cotransport by means of a proton-pumping ATPase.\r"

  ".W": "Lysozyme is a major secretory product of human and rodent macrophages and a useful marker for myelomonocytic cells. Based on the known human lysozyme amino acid sequence, oligonucleotides were synthesized and used as probes to screen a phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated U937 cDNA library. A full-length human lysozyme cDNA clone, pHL-2, was obtained and characterized. Sequence analysis shows that human lysozyme, like chicken lysozyme, has an 18-amino-acid-long signal peptide, but unlike the chicken lysozyme cDNA, the human lysozyme cDNA has a greater than 1-kilobase-long 3' nontranslated sequence. Interestingly, within this 3' region, an inverted repeat of the Alu family of repetitive sequences was discovered. In RNA blot analyses, DNA probes prepared from pHL-2 can be used to detect lysozyme mRNA not only from human but also from mouse and rat. Moreover, by in situ hybridization, complementary RNA transcripts have been used as probes to detect lysozyme mRNA in mouse macrophages and Paneth cells. This human lysozyme cDNA clone is therefore likely to be a useful molecular probe for studying macrophage distribution and gene expression.\r"

The M gene is expressed weakly in myeloblasts, moderately in immature macrophages, and strongly in both mature macrophages and macrophage-rich tissues, while high levels of P transcripts are present only in small intestine.

  ".U": "88320418\r", 
  ".W": "We have determined the relative stabilities and melting behaviors of DNA hairpin structures as a function of the nonbonded residues in the loop. The specific family of hairpin structures we investigated in this work is formed by the 16-mer sequence d[CGAACG(X)4CGTTCG], where X is deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, deoxyguanosine, or deoxythymidine. As shown below, this 16-mer can fold back on itself to form a family of DNA hairpin structures that possess a common hexameric stem duplex and a nonbonded loop of 4 nucleotides. For the hairpin structures investigated in this work, we varied the loop composition from all purine residues to all pyrimidine residues. (Formula: see text). We thermodynamically characterized the relative stabilities and melting profiles of these hairpin structures by a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques. To establish a thermodynamic \"baseline,\" we also conducted parallel studies on the isolated hexameric duplex d[CGAACG).(CG-TTCG)], which corresponds to the common stem duplex present in each hairpin structure. Our spectroscopic and calorimetric data reveal the following: (i) The hairpin structure with four dT residues in the loop exhibits the highest melting temperature, while the corresponding hairpin structure with four dA residues in the loop exhibits the lowest melting temperature. (ii) The free energy data at 25 degrees C reveal the following order of DNA hairpin stability for the four structures studied here: T loop greater than C loop greater than G loop greater than A loop. In other words, the pyrimidine-looped hairpins of four residues are more stable than the purine-looped hairpins. (iii) The loop-dependent order of hairpin stability is paralleled by a similar trend in the calorimetrically determined transition enthalpies for hairpin disruption. Thus, the enhanced stability of the pyrimidine-looped hairpin structures relative to purine-looped hairpin structures is enthalpic in origin. To develop insight into the molecular basis for the thermodynamic differences, proton NMR spectroscopy was used to probe for structural disparities between the most stable hairpin structure (T loop) and the least stable hairpin structure (A loop). Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy revealed connectivities between the residues in the stem duplexes of both hairpin structures that are consistent with B-form DNA. In addition, the nonbonded residues in both the T and A loops exhibited the same connectivity patterns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relation between DNA polymerase fidelity and base pairing stability is investigated by using DNA primer-template duplexes that contain a common 9-base template sequence but have either correct (A.T) or incorrect (G.T, C.T, T.T) base pairs at the primer 3' terminus. Thermal melting and enzyme kinetic measurements are compared for each kind of terminus. Analysis of melting temperatures finds that differences between the free energy changes upon dissociation (delta delta Go) are only 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 kcal.mol-1 (1 cal = 4.18 J) for terminal A.T compared to G.T, C.T, and T.T mispairs, respectively, at 37 degrees C. We show that enthalpy changes are directly correlated with entropy changes for normal and abnormal base pairs in DNA in aqueous solution and that delta delta Go values are small because of near cancellation of corresponding enthalpy and entropy components. The kinetics of elongating primer termini are measured with purified Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha. The matched A.T terminus is found to be extended approximately 200 times faster than a G.T mismatch and 1400 and 2500 times faster than C.T and T.T mismatches, respectively. Enzymatic discrimination against elongating mismatched termini is based mainly on Km rather than Vmax differences. From Km at 37 degrees C, we find delta delta Go values of 2.6-3.7 kcal.mol-1, about an order of magnitude greater than indicated by melting data. A similar measurement of nucleotide insertion kinetics has previously found rates of forming A.T base pairs to be 500 times greater than G.T mispairs and 20,000 times greater than C.T and T.T mispairs. Here also, Km differences are mainly responsible for discrimination and indicate even larger delta delta Go values (4.3-4.9 kcal.mol-1). Thus, free energy differences between correct and incorrect base pairs in the active site cleft of polymerase appear to be greater than 10 times as large as in aqueous medium. We explore the idea that a binding cleft that snugly fits correct base pairs and excludes water at the active site may amplify base-pair free energy differences by reducing entropy differences and increasing enthalpy differences sufficiently to account for nucleotide insertion and extension fidelity.\r"

The site-site interaction causes looping out of the intervening DNA sequence as visualized by electron microscopy. Because the autoregulatory sequence of the initiator cistron also binds initiator protein, we investigated whether the gamma origin-bound protein can participate in autoregulation by interaction of the two sites through a protein bridge. We discovered that the two sites do not interact in vitro at their natural locations when on opposite faces of the double helix. Moving the two sites to the same face of the double helix by introducing a half turn into the intervening sequence allows protein-mediated site-site interaction to occur.\r"

The cDNA was expressed in a mammalian cell line (COS-7), and the alpha 2-adrenergic ligand [3H]rauwolscine was bound. Competition curve analysis with a variety of adrenergic ligands suggests that this cDNA clone represents the alpha 2B-adrenergic receptor. The gene for this receptor is on human chromosome 4, whereas the gene for the human platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2A) lies on chromosome 10. This ability to express the receptor in mammalian cells, free of other adrenergic receptor subtypes, should help in developing more selective alpha-adrenergic ligands.\r"

  ".W": "Differential expression of type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase isozymes has been linked to growth regulation and differentiation. We examined the expression of protein kinase isozymes in the LS 174T human colon cancer cell line during 8-chloroadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Cl-cAMP)-induced growth inhibition. Two species of RII (the regulatory subunit of protein kinase type II) with apparent Mr 52,000 (RII52) and Mr 56,000 (RII56) and a single species of RI (the regulatory subunit of protein kinase type I) with Mr 48,000 were identified in the cancer cells. RI and both forms of RII were covalently labeled with 8-azidoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic [32P]monophosphate, and two anti-RII antibodies that exclusively recognize either RII52 or RII56 resolved two forms of the RII receptors. 8-Cl-cAMP treatment induced a decrease of RI and an increase of both RII52 and RII56 in the cytosols of cancer cells and rapid translocation (within 10 min) of RII52 from the cytosol to nucleus. 8-Cl-cAMP caused transcriptional activation of the RII52 receptor gene and inactivation of the RI receptor gene. It also exhibited high-affinity site-1-selective binding to the purified preparations of both RII receptor proteins. Thus, differential regulation of various forms of cAMP receptor proteins is involved in 8-Cl-cAMP-induced regulation of cancer cell growth, and nuclear translocation of RII52 receptor protein appears to be an early event in such differential regulation.\r"

  ".W": "The crystal structure of the synthetic DNA dodecamer CGCATATATGCG has been solved at 2.2-A resolution. Its central 6 base pairs adopt the alternating-B-DNA helix structure proposed nearly a decade ago. This alternating poly(AT) structure contrasts with the four known examples of what can be termed a poly(A) subfamily of B-DNA structures: CGCAAAAAAGCG, CGCAAATTTGCG, CGCGAATTCGCG, and CGCGAATTbrCGCG, their defining characteristic being a succession of two or more adenines along one strand, in a region of 4 or more A.T base pairs. All five helices show a characteristically narrow minor groove in their AT centers, but the mean propeller twist at A.T base pairs is lower in the alternating poly(AT) helix than in the poly(A) subfamily of helices. Three general principles emerge from x-ray analyses of B-DNA oligonucleotides: (i) GC and mixed-sequence B-DNA have a wide minor groove, whereas the minor groove is narrow in heteropolymer or homopolymer AT sequences. (ii) G.C base pairs have low propeller twist; A.T pairs can adopt a high propeller twist but need not do so. A high propeller twist can be stabilized by cross-strand hydrogen bonds in the major or minor groove, examples being the minor groove bonds seen in CCAAGATTGG and the major groove bonds that can accompany AA sequences in the poly(A) family. (iii) Homopolymer poly(A) tracts may be stiffer than are alternating AT or general-sequence DNA because of these cross-strand major groove hydrogen bonds. Poly(A) tracts appear internally unbent, but bends may occur at junctions with mixed-sequence DNA because of differences in propeller twist, base pair inclination, and base stacking on the two sides of the junction. Bending occurs most easily via base roll, favoring compression of the broad major groove.\r"

Alkaline phosphatase activity can also be visualized directly in individual transfected cells by histochemical staining. The gene is appropriate for use as a reporter in studies of gene regulation since its expression is dependent on the presence of exogenous transcription control elements. The overall assay to detect the expression of the gene is quantitative, very rapid, and inexpensive. Cotransfections of cells with pSV2Apap and a related plasmid carrying the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (pSV2Acat) indicate that transcription of these two genes is detected with roughly the same sensitivity.\r"

A comparison of CPMASS and solution spectra of Nase labeled with either [methyl-13C]methionine or [15N]valine shows that the chemical shifts in the crystalline and solution states are virtually identical. This result is strong evidence that the protein conformations in the solution and crystalline states are nearly the same. Because of the close correspondence of the crystal and solution chemical shifts, sequential assignments obtained in solution apply to the crystal spectra. It should therefore be possible to study the molecular structure and dynamics of many sequentially assigned atomic sites in Nase crystals. Similar experiments are applicable to the growing number of proteins that can be obtained from efficient expression systems.\r"

The results show the following: (i) The sugar influx rate by simple diffusion was identical under either altered condition. (ii) Semistarvation stimulated D-glucose uptake by system 2 (both its Vmax and Km increased), whereas system 1 was untouched. (iii) Fasting increased the capacity of system 1 without affecting either Km of system 1 or Vmax and Km of system 2. The effect of fasting on Vmax of system 1 cannot be attributed to indirect effects from changes in ionic permeability because the kinetic difference between control and fasted animals persisted when the membrane potential was short-circuited with equilibrated K+ and valinomycin. This work provides further evidence for the existence of two distinct sodium-activated D-glucose transport systems in the intestinal brush-border membrane, which adapt independently to either semistarvation or fasting.\r"

Purified MDGF exhibited acidic charge characteristics (pI 5.0) and migrated with an apparent Mr of 40,000 +/- 2000 in molecular sizing HPLC columns. Elution from NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels showed that the growth-promoting activity was associated with three or four protein bands. The highest molecular weight species representing the most intense silver-stained band corresponded to 42,000; the lowest molecular weight species was 33,000. MDGF activity was stable to treatment with acid (pH 2.0) or base (pH 10.0) and heating (100 degrees C, 5 min) but was inactivated upon reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol. The acidic MDGF did not effectively compete with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) for receptor binding and was not inhibited by PDGF antibodies. Previous studies have suggested that fibroblast growth-stimulating activity of macrophages is largely due to their secretion of interleukin 1 and a PDGF-like molecule. Our purification and biochemical characterization studies reveal the occurrence of multiple forms of fibroblast growth-stimulating activity in human monocyte conditioned medium. The MDGF activity characterized here appears to be structurally and functionally distinct from the previously described fibroblast growth-promoting activities including interleukin 1, basic fibroblast growth factor, and PDGF.\r"

In the dark, the mutant fails to synthesize carotene and retinal, but it contains the apoprotein opsin. When retinal synthesis is induced by light treatment, the retinal combines with opsin to form rhodopsin, and the cells swim away from a source of light. Since the amount of light required to trigger a phototactic response is inversely proportional to the concentration of rhodopsin, the decrease in amount of light necessary to generate that response can serve as a measure of the amount of retinal synthesized in cells after induction. Using this assay, we found that (i) light induction of retinal depends linearly on light exposure and rhodopsin concentration during the exposure; (ii) the action spectrum of light induction is identical with that for phototaxis for which the receptor pigment is rhodopsin; and (iii) incubation with all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinal before light exposure shifts the action-spectrum peak for light induction 0.41 eV (-71 nm). We conclude that the photopigment for induction of retinal synthesis is a rhodopsin. The time lag required for induction of retinal synthesis and preliminary experiments with transcription or translation inhibitors suggest that alterations in gene expression could be involved in the induction process. Its control could be similar to other processes in which membrane receptors for hormones, neurotransmitters, or growth factors regulate gene expression.\r"

Individual C3H/10T1/2 cells were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, which causes hypomethylation of DNA. Cells were grown to subconfluence, and individual microcolonies were trypsinized into two fractions. One fraction was cryopreserved, and the other was replated and maintained in culture. Ten percent of these replated colonies became morphologically transformed after 4-6 weeks. The cryopreserved ancestral cells of both transformed and nontransformed microcolonies were then cultured and compared to each other and to the transformants for phenotypic properties of cellular transformation. Pretransformed and nonpretransformed ancestral cells were initially morphologically indistinguishable, their early growth curves did not differ significantly, and they did not form colonies in soft agar. On continued growth in culture, however, the pretransformants displayed all of the phenotypic characteristics of transformation. Furthermore, transformation occurred in a given pretransformant in most or all of the cells of that clone. Thus, cells committed to transformation could be isolated in this way prior to phenotypic transformation. Studies of these pretransformed cells will permit examination of the earliest events in carcinogenesis and the role of DNA methylation in transformation.\r"

  ".W": "Reliable markers to distinguish human colon carcinoma from normal colonic epithelium are needed particularly for poorly differentiated tumors where no useful marker is currently available. To search for markers we constructed cDNA libraries from human colon carcinoma cell lines and screened for clones that hybridize to a greater degree with mRNAs of colon carcinomas than with their normal counterparts. Here we report one such cDNA clone that hybridizes with a 1.2-kilobase (kb) mRNA, the level of which is approximately equal to 9-fold greater in colon carcinoma than in adjacent normal colonic epithelium. Blot hybridization of total RNA from a variety of human colon carcinoma cell lines shows that the level of this 1.2-kb mRNA in poorly differentiated colon carcinomas is as high as or higher than that in well-differentiated carcinomas. Molecular cloning and complete sequencing of cDNA corresponding to the full-length open reading frame of this 1.2-kb mRNA unexpectedly show it to contain all the partial cDNA sequence encoding 135 amino acid residues previously reported for a human laminin receptor. The deduced amino acid sequence suggests that this putative laminin-binding protein from human colon carcinomas consists of 295 amino acid residues with interesting features. Containing only two cysteine residues, the protein does not have consensus sequences for asparagine-linked glycosylation, amphipathic alpha-helix, or the N-terminal leader signal sequences for entry into endoplasmic reticulum, although hydrophobic segments for potential membrane associations exist. There is an unusual C-terminal 70-amino acid segment, which is trypsin-resistant (no lysine or arginine) and highly negatively charged (13 aspartic plus glutamic residues). Within this segment are five repeats of (Asp/Glu)-Trp-(Ser/Thr); two of these are nearly tandem repeats of Thr-Glu-Asp-Trp-Ser-Ala-Xaa-Pro.\r"

A DNA segment containing 129 nucleotides upstream from the cTNT transcription initiation site (cTNT-129) directs expression of a heterologous marker gene in transfected embryonic skeletal muscle cells but is inactive in embryonic cardiac or fibroblast cells. By using chimeric promoter constructions, in which distal and proximal segments of cTNT-129 are fused to reciprocal segments of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV tk) gene promoter, the DNA segment responsible for this cell specificity can be localized to the cTNT distal promoter region, located between 50 and 129 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site. The ability of the cTNT distal promoter region to confer skeletal muscle-specific activity upon a heterologous promoter is abolished when it is displaced 60 nucleotides upstream, indicating that its ability to direct skeletal muscle-specific transcription probably requires proximity to other components of the transcription initiation region. Two copies of the heptamer, CATTCCT (\"muscle-CAT\" or \"M-CAT\" motif), reside within the 80-nucleotide cTNT distal promoter region. A 3-nucleotide mutation in one of these copies inactivates the cTNT promoter in skeletal muscle cells. Therefore, the M-CAT motif is a distal promoter element required for expression of the cTNT promoter in embryonic skeletal muscle cells. Since the M-CAT motif is found in other contractile protein gene promoters, it may represent one example of a muscle-specific promoter element.\r"

  ".W": "When an advantageous mutation is fixed in a population by selection, a closely linked selectively neutral or mildly detrimental mutation may \"hitchhike\" to fixation along with it. It has been suggested that hitchhiking might increase the rate of molecular evolution. Computer simulations and a mathematical argument show that complete linkage to either advantageous or deleterious mutations does not affect the substitution of selectively neutral mutations. However, the simulations show that linkage to selected background mutations decreases the rate of fixation of advantageous mutations and increases the rate of fixation of detrimental mutations. This is true whether the linked background mutations are advantageous or detrimental, and it verifies and extends previous observations that linkage tends to reduce the effects of selection on evolution. These results can be interpreted in terms of the Hill-Robertson effect: a locus linked to another locus under selection experiences a reduction in effective population size. The interpretation of differences in evolutionary rates between different genomes or different regions of a genome may be confounded by the effects of strong linkage and selection. Recombination is expected to reduce the overall rate of molecular evolution while enhancing the rate of adaptive evolution.\r"

Currently, the two closest DNA markers are D4S10 (G8), located approximately equal to 3 centimorgans centromeric to HD, and D4S43 (C4H), positioned 0-1.5 centimorgans from HD. In an effort to move closer to the HD gene, with the eventual goal of identifying the gene itself, we have applied the technique of chromosome jumping to this region. A 200-kilobase jumping library has been constructed, and a jump from D4S10 has been obtained and its approximate distance verified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Two restriction fragment length polymorphisms have been identified at the jump locus, which is denoted D4S81. Linkage analysis of previously identified recombinants between D4S10 and HD or D4S10 and D4S43 shows that in two of five events the jump has crossed the recombination points. This unequivocally orients D4S10 and D4S81 on the chromosome, provides additional markers for HD, and suggests that recombination frequency in this region of chromosome 4 may be increased, so that the physical distance from D4S10 to HD may not be as large as originally suspected.\r"

We demonstrate that the H-Y- variant of Sxr (Sxr') arose by a partial deletion within the Sxr region. Also, we show that intrachromosomal recombination between the Y short arm and Sxr' can sometimes occur during male meiosis, restoring the deleted DNA sequences and resulting in an H-Y+ mouse (male 719 in this paper). Based on these results, we propose a model for the generation of the original Sxr region and the Sxr' and Sxr719 variants.\r"

This domain contains a consensus zinc finger motif (Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa13-Cys-Xaa2-Cys) in which the cysteine residues serve as postulated ligands. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry applied to bacterially expressed E1A proteins revealed that the 289-amino acid protein binds one zinc ion, whereas the 243-amino acid protein binds no zinc. Replacing individual cysteine residues of the finger with other amino acids destroyed the trans-activating ability of the 289-amino acid protein, even when structurally or functionally conserved amino acids were substituted. These results strongly suggest that the zinc finger of the 46-amino acid domain is intimately linked to the ability of the large E1A protein to stimulate transcription of E1A-inducible promoters. Furthermore, zinc binding to one of the mutant finger proteins suggests either that only a precise finger structure formed by the tetrahedral coordination of zinc to the four consensus ligands is required for trans-activation or, possibly, that one of several neighboring histidine residues in various combinations with three of the consensus cysteine residues normally coordinates zinc. How the zinc finger in E1A might interact with DNA or protein to bring about trans-activation is discussed.\r"

To eliminate the problems of transfer of packaging functions and helper virus formation encountered with the previously available packaging systems, two mutant Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived proviral genomes carrying complementary mutations in the gag-pol or env regions were sequentially introduced into NIH 3T3 cells by cotransformation. Both genomes contained a deletion of the psi sequence necessary for the efficient encapsidation of retroviral genomes into virus particles and additional alterations at the 3' end of the provirus. We show that the resulting packaging cell lines psi CRIP and psi CRE can be used to isolate clones that stably produce high titers (10(6) colony-forming units/ml) of recombinant retroviruses with amphotropic and ecotropic host ranges, respectively. More importantly, we demonstrate that viral producers derived from the packaging cell lines do not transfer the packaging functions, or yield helper virus, even under conditions where existing packaging cell lines can be shown to yield transfer of packaging functions and/or helper virus. These properties of the psi CRIP and psi CRE packaging lines make them particularly valuable reagents for in vivo gene transfer studies aimed at cell lineage analysis and the development of human gene replacement therapies.\r"

Mitochondria treated with various prooxidants have an increased level of oh8dG.

The results show the following: (i) HLA-DQ molecules of HLA-DRw15-positive IDDM patients are different from those of HLA-DRw15-positive controls, suggesting that the HLA-DQ gene of DRw15 haplotypes is involved in a protective effect. (ii) HLA-DR and -DQ products of DRw16-positive IDDM are functionally indistinguishable from those of HLA-DRw16-positive controls. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that the residue at position 57 on the DQ beta chain could play a crucial biological role in antigen presentation to T cells as far as the DRw16 haplotype is concerned.

In addition to the IgE-binding alpha chain, the receptor contains a single beta chain and two, disulfide-linked, gamma chains. From a cDNA library of a rat mucosal mast cell tumor, from which we recently cloned cDNAs coding for the alpha chain, we have now isolated cDNAs coding for the beta subunit. In vitro transcription-translation of the cDNA directed the synthesis of a polypeptide reactive with two distinctive anti-beta monoclonal antibodies and whose molecular weight was identical to that of authentic beta chains. Polyclonal antibodies to beta peptides expressed in Escherichia coli reacted with intact receptors and isolated beta chains. The gene encodes a protein of 243 residues with no leader sequence. A hydropathicity plot suggests that the polypeptide crosses the plasma membrane four times. The epitope recognized by one of the monoclonal antibodies was localized to the NH2 terminus; that by the other was localized to the COOH terminus. Since those antibodies react with membranes and not with intact cells, we suggest that both ends of the beta subunit are cytoplasmic. RNA transfer blots at high stringency failed to reveal mRNA for beta chains in a variety of cells (in particular, monocytes) that do not contain the high-affinity receptor for IgE.\r"

Such observations show that the shared primary structure between reovirus type 3 sigma 1 polypeptide and antireceptor mAb 87.92.6 defines the oligopeptide neutralizing/cell-attachment epitope of reovirus type 3.

Much is now known of the structural and functional characteristics of NGF, whose gene has recently been cloned. Since it is synthesized in largest amounts by the male mouse submandibular gland, its role exclusively in nerve growth is questionable. NGF also causes histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro, and we have shown elsewhere that it causes significant, dose-dependent, generalized mast cell proliferation in the rat in vivo when administered neonatally. Our experiments now indicate that NGF causes a significant stimulation of granulocyte colonies grown from human peripheral blood in standard hemopoietic methylcellulose assays. Further, NGF appears to act in a relatively selective fashion to induce the differentiation of eosinophils and basophils/mast cells. Depletion experiments show that the NGF effect may be T-cell dependent and that NGF augments the colony-stimulating effect of supernatants from the leukemic T-cell (Mo) line. The hemopoietic activity of NGF is blocked by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to NGF. We conclude that NGF may indirectly act as a local growth factor in tissues other than those of the nervous system by causing T cells to synthesize or secrete molecules with colony-stimulating activity. In view of the synthesis of NGF in tissue injury, the involvement of basophils/mast cells and eosinophils in allergic and other inflammatory processes, and the association of mast cells with fibrosis and tissue repair, we postulate that NGF plays an important biological role in a variety of repair processes.\r"
