  ".W": "The mechanisms underlying clonus are considered in relation to current theories. By the use of a lever attached to a printed motor forces have been applied to the upper edge of the patella, a steady stretching force in suitable hemiplegic patients started the clonic oscillations. With rhythmic forces it has been found that the underlying rhythm is very resistant to entrainment. The oscillation provoked by a steady bias is increased in amplitude but unchanged in frequency when inertia is added to the apparatus. The frequency of clonus at the ankle, patella and wrist is similar. These and other considerations lead to the conclusion that clonus is not due to the self re-excitation of stretch reflexes but to an autonomous central generator.\r"

During this period, only 3% of patients younger than 17 years who presented with the chief complaint of low-back pain eventually had lumbar disc operation. In 43 patients it was thought that an injury had precipitated the symptoms. Thirty-seven patients had a nerve deficit at the time of initial evaluation. Water-soluble contrast myelography with repeated postmyelographic computerized tomography is currently used to confirm the diagnosis. The disc operations were performed at the L4-5 level in 47% of patients, the L5-S1 level in 45%, the L3-4 and L4-5 level in 4%, and the L4-5 and L5-S1 level in 4%. Fourteen of the 74 patient underwent spinal fusion with their first operation. At 9 months postoperatively, 95% had good or excellent results. During an extended follow-up period of up to 34 years, 16 of the patients with early successful results required further back procedures. After all medical and surgical treatment in this group of patients, the results were excellent in 57%, good in 38%, and poor in only 4%.\r"

All of the patients were treated with the same protocols by the same physicians and staff in the same intensive care unit. All of the patients had intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Of the 330 patients, 100 were in the pediatric age group (0 to 19 years of age) and 230 were in the adult group (20 to 80 years of age). Statistical analyses were performed with regard to outcome, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, ICP course, and incidence of surgical lesions. The average emergency room GCS score as well as the 24-hour GCS score for each group was the same. The percentage of patients having ICP that was normal, increased but reducible, and increased but not reducible in each group was the same. The pediatric patients had a significantly higher percentage of good outcomes (43%) than the adult patients (28%) (p less than 0.01). They also had a significantly lower mortality rate (24%) than the adult patients (45%) (p less than 0.01). At 1 year following injury, 55% of pediatric patients had a good outcome compared to 21% of adults (p less than 0.001); this trend was evident at 3 months, with the same p value. Pediatric patients with normal ICP had a higher percentage of good outcomes (70%) than the adult patients with normal ICP (48%) (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in outcome in pediatric and adult patients with mass lesions or with increased ICP, regardless of whether or not the pressure was reducible. There was a much higher incidence of surgical mass lesions in adult patients (46%) than in pediatric patients (24%) (p less than 0.001).\r"

The T1 values of chronic subdural hematomas were significantly shorter than gray matter values and significantly longer than white matter values. The T2 values were significantly longer than both gray matter and white matter values. These findings were consistent with previous reports. However, six hematomas (30%) were iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted images. Possible mechanisms responsible for the difference in intensity of chronic subdural hematoma on MRI are discussed, and the important role of methemoglobin formation is emphasized.\r"

Nine of the 12 patients had symptoms referable to the fifth cranial nerve, but only three complained of facial pain. The 12 patients presented eight different pathological entities, including meningioma, lipoma, schwannoma, malignant melanotic schwannoma, arachnoid cyst, neurofibroma, epidermoid tumor, and chordoma. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were most useful in localizing the lesion to Meckel's cave. All 12 patients underwent a subtemporal approach to the lesion, and gross total removal was achieved in 11. Postoperative results were excellent with no increased neurological deficits seen 3 months postoperatively. Most patients had resolution of the cranial nerve deficits except for fifth nerve function, which was impaired in nine patients postoperatively. This series demonstrates that lesions in Meckel's cave can have a varied and unusual presentation, as well as an assortment of pathology. Total removal of lesions in this area resulted in relief of symptoms in most patients, with minimum morbidity.\r"

The biomechanical properties of ring-shaped arterial specimens were investigated by loading the specimens at a constant deformation rate until rupture. The relative amounts of collagen type I and type III were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) studies of cyanogen bromide peptides of collagen prepared from the arterial samples. A deficiency of collagen type III was demonstrated in specimens of the MCA in six of 14 patients with a ruptured intracranial saccular aneurysm. This deficiency was not accompanied by alterations in the mechanical arterial strength but resulted in a significant increase in the extensibility at stress values corresponding to blood pressures between 100 and 200 mm Hg. No difference was found between aneurysm patients and the control group in regard to the biomechanical properties of the brachial artery, despite the presence of a significant deficiency of collagen type III. The increase in vascular extensibility of the MCA may represent alterations in the fibrous structure and functional integrity of the cerebral arteries of aneurysm patients with collagen type III deficiency. Together with aggravating hemodynamic stresses, this deficiency may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of saccular aneurysms.\r"

  ".U": "88035193\r", 
  ".W": "The form and function of blood vessels are determined by the cells that constitute their microenvironment. Brain tissue around tumors contains varying numbers of tumor cells that could influence local capillaries to lose their blood-brain barrier (BBB), as they do in the tumor itself. Microvascular permeability cannot be measured directly in humans but can be inferred from a knowledge of vessel ultrastructure. The authors have examined the vascular ultrastructure associated with the BBB in human peritumoral brain tissue for evidence of BBB compromise and to correlate BBB features with the cellular components of the vessel microenvironment. Light microscopic examination of brain tissue samples in patients with primary brain tumors showed that the tissue lying beyond the visible edge of the tumor ranged from essentially normal to grossly infiltrated with tumor cells. Although some of the vessels were structurally normal, the microvessels as a group had elongated junctional clefts (unfused regions) and an increase in the density of endothelial vesicles. Furthermore, the cleft index (the percentage of the junctional profile that is unfused) varied directly with the local cell density. A subpopulation of vessels enveloped by a layer of tumor cells was grossly abnormal. However, vessels that were not immediately invested by tumor cells also showed some abnormalities. It is concluded that tumor cells infiltrating peritumoral brain tissue cause blood vessels to take on some of the structural characteristics of leaky vessels. Since direct contact is not required, and since the degree of abnormality correlates with the number of tumor cells in the environment, the authors suggest that this inductive influence is exerted over a distance and is dependent on the concentration of the inducing factors.\r"

To evaluate the effect of hypertension on healing of small arteries following MVA, 36 spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to end-to-side MVA of their common carotid arteries. At specific times after surgery the rats were sacrificed; the anastomotic site was removed and examined with light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. All MVA's were patent, and there was no evidence of thrombus formation or stenosis at the operative site in any group. Also, there was no difference between the spontaneously hypertensive rats and the control normotensive rat group in the rate of endothelial coverage of the MVA. The presence of hypertension appears to have no effect on healing of small arteries in the rat.\r"

Approximately 60% of the mice spontaneously developed intracranial hemorrhage 20 days after the injection. About 1 week after the hemorrhage, a lens-shaped or spherical subdural hematoma was observed, accompanied by marked dilatation of the lateral ventricles and intraventricular hemorrhage. Histological examination revealed that the hematoma contained well-organized outer and inner membranes. Fresh hemorrhage surrounded by many hemosiderin-laden macrophages was seen at the margin of the hematoma adjacent to the organizing outer membrane, in which many fibroblasts and blood vessels were noted. The inner membrane of the hematoma was made up of several tiers of flattened cells with thin-walled blood vessels. The gross morphology and histology of these hematomas closely resembled those of human chronic subdural hematoma.\r"

Quantitative cultures were performed and uniformly became sterile in the early cerebritis stage, approximately 3 days after bacterial inoculation. Therefore, this brain abscess model should not be utilized for the evaluation of new antimicrobial treatment regimens. Rather, other models which document persistent viable organisms within cerebral abscesses need to be developed.\r"

Rhesus monkeys were studied to determine whether phased drug delivery during diastole from a modified pulsatile angiographic injector would improve drug mixing in vivo. A radiolabeled flow tracer, carbon-14-iodoantipyrine (14C-IAP), was injected into the ICA of three monkeys in 80-msec pulses, each ending at least 50 msec before the end of local diastole. Local isotope concentration in the brain was determined by quantitative autoradiography. The ratio of highest to lowest concentration was 1.86 +/- 0.26 (mean +/- standard deviation) in the frontoparietal cortex, 1.65 +/- 0.42 in the frontoparietal white matter, 1.89 +/- 0.28 in the temporal cortex, and 1.39 +/- 0.17 in the basal ganglia. These results were similar to recordings in three control animals that received intravenous 14C-IAP to demonstrate complete drug mixing (1.37 +/- 0.12, 1.41 +/- 0.11, 1.70 +/- 0.08, 1.22 +/- 0.24, respectively), and contrasted to findings in five animals which received continuous intracarotid infusions to demonstrate standard ICA drug delivery (4.54 +/- 2.07, 2.94 +/- 1.45, 5.43 +/- 3.57, 3.60 +/- 2.90, respectively). Pulsed intra-arterial infusion during diastole provides a technically simple method for improving intravascular drug mixing, and results in drug delivery to tissue capillaries that is proportional to blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "Drug streaming has been implicated in the development of focal necrotic lesions in perfused tissues following intracarotid chemotherapy of brain tumors at low infusion rates. The narrow infusate path characteristic of streaming within laminar blood flow is not observed at high infusion rates such as are typical in contrast injection for angiography. By periodically pulsing the infusate at a high rate, the mechanisms of rapid mixing can be exploited while retaining the practicality of low average infusion rates. This in vitro study demonstrates the effects of the pulse-controlling parameters and the catheter characteristics and placement on mixing effectiveness. An internal carotid artery model including eight cerebral branches was infused with dye through various indwelling catheters, and individual branch effluents were collected and analyzed spectrophotometrically for dye concentration. While catheter placement dominates the factors that control infusate distribution, judicious selection of the pulse parameters can alleviate that dependence. A primary advantage is gained by phasing the pulse to occur during that period of the cardiac cycle when the blood flow is lowest at the injection site. The data clearly showed that diastole-phased pulsed infusions are highly effective in producing a uniform infusate distribution at low average infusion rates.\r"

In this model, light-dye interactions induce primary microvascular stasis, resulting in consistent patterns of tissue necrosis. Four groups of rats underwent photoinduction times ranging from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. Neurological and electrophysiological functions were assessed starting 1 week after irradiation and continuing for 8 weeks. A functional neurological score was obtained by combining results from sensory and motor tasks, and electrophysiological function was evaluated from the somatosensory evoked potential recordings. In rats irradiated for short periods (30 seconds and 1 minute) mild behavioral deficits were documented. In contrast, electrical conduction was suppressed acutely in both groups; this recovered by 8 weeks to baseline or near baseline in the 30-second group but not in the 1-minute group. In rats irradiated for longer periods (5 and 10 minutes), severe behavioral and conduction abnormalities were detected at both the subacute and chronic testing periods. Although no significant difference in behavior was documented between the 5- and 10-minute groups acutely, the rats with 5-minute photoinduction time demonstrated a significant improvement in behavior over time whereas the group with 10-minute photoinduction time showed no improvement. A severe conduction block was present in both animal groups during the course of the study. Histopathological examination combined with morphometric measurements of the lesion area in cross section revealed four different degrees of spinal cord necrosis which correlated significantly with photoinduction times and neurological scores at 8 weeks. Reproducible degrees of ischemic damage to spinal cord parenchyma following primary microvascular occlusion result in a predictable sequence of behavioral and functional abnormalities, which in some cases recover with time.\r"

Of the two patients in whom no infarcts were visualized, one had an anterior myocardial infarct. This patient underwent successful thrombolytic therapy, with attendant minimization of creatine kinase release. The other patient had a small, nonreperfused inferior myocardial infarct. Five patients with a history of remote infarction and acute necrosis showed antimyosin uptake only in regions concordant with the acute episodes of infarction, and radiolabeled antimyosin Fab localized in neither old infarcts nor normal, noninfarcted myocardium. Antimyosin Fab scintigraphy, thus, appears to be a highly specific means of delineating necrotic myocardium, at least in this limited and selected group of patients.\r"

Liver tissue that was attached to the gallbladder by adhesions and removed at surgery was reviewed histologically and correlated with the presence or absence of a RIHA.

The dogs were preinstrumented with aortic and LV catheters, electromagnetic aortic and LCx coronary artery flow probes, high-fidelity LV micromanometers, LCx coronary artery occluders, and 4-mm ultrasonic transverse LV diameter and 2-mm regional LV segment crystal pairs. Radionuclide LV regional phase and amplitude variables were calculated for each condition. The absolute changes in LCx region RNA mean, median, and standard deviation of mean phase correlated with the percent changes in LCx segment crystal fractional shortening (r = -0.71, -0.64, and -0.51, respectively; all p less than or equal to 0.01). Similarly, the absolute changes and percent changes in LCx region RNA mean amplitude per pixel correlated with the percent changes in LCx segment crystal fractional shortening (r = 0.89 and 0.94, respectively; both p less than 0.001). When these LCx region RNA phase variables were subgrouped according to mild or severe depression or augmentation in LCx segment crystal fractional shortening, progressive differences were observed between the average values for these subgroups (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.001). These data, therefore, suggest that these regional RNA phase variables may be able to detect and quantify alterations in LV contraction patterns due to transient ischemia.\r"

These studies suggest no significant difference in clearance rate exists between intact IgG and its F(ab')2 fragment, and little difference between these moieties and intact IgM. Fab is cleared considerably faster than the others, however. While significant differences in clearance rates exist, the magnitude of the differences are not as large as those following intravenous injection particularly when ambulation by the animal is allowed. When ambulation is allowed, clearance rates of all classes and fragments are accelerated and quite similar. Injection into the subcutaneous tissues of the footpad results in consistently faster clearance than an injection into the subcutaneous tissues of the abdomen. Ambulation considerably increased the clearance of antibodies, presumably by increasing lymph flow. These studies imply that the choice of intact antibody versus fragments for kinetic reasons may be less critical (particularly if ambulation is allowed) by the subcutaneous as compared with the intravenous delivery route. This kinetic information should be useful in designing imaging protocols with radiolabeled antibodies administered subcutaneously for purposes of imaging disease processes involving the lymphatics.\r"

One DPA and one SPA instrument, however, showed significant time trends associated with source activity. The fourth DPA instrument had a significant linear decrease in BMD over a source life in the automatic mode but performed better in the manual mode.\r"

At subsequent surgery, acute and chronic cholecystitis were present without evidence of choledocholithiasis or other source of obstruction.

  ".W": "Obesity in humans is associated with decreased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL), but the mechanisms effecting this relationship have not been established. Four treatment groups were used to develop a range of moderate adiposity: rat pups were raised in litters of 4 or 14 and fed from weaning diets of 6 or 24% fat (wt/wt) for 15-17 wk. Lipoproteins from plasma and from a recirculating in situ liver perfusion system were then separated and analyzed, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was assayed in samples of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and body composition and cholesterol concentrations of various tissues were determined. There was little effect of the diet or litter size treatments on plasma lipids or lipoprotein profiles. Compared to the marked changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism that have been observed in severely obese animal models, there was generally little effect of the treatments used to produce this model of moderate diet-induced adiposity. Adiposity was unrelated to plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides. While fatness was positively, although weakly, correlated with plasma levels of several HDL components, including HDL cholesterol, there were no consistent treatment effects on these measures. Plasma HDL levels and adiposity were unrelated to hepatic HDL production or tissue LPL activities. A review of the literature suggests that differences in plasma HDL responses to adiposity in humans and in experimental animals may be due to inherent species differences in lipoprotein metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of feeding redfish (Sebastes marinus or mantella) oil or a derived n-3 fatty acid concentrate containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the fatty acid compositions of individual phospholipids in selected neural tissues was studied in growing male rats. Control animals were given sunflower oil in the diet for the 5-wk feeding trial. Lipid analyses revealed that EPA (20:5n-3) became significantly enriched in all phospholipid fractions (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol) in the tissues studied (brain, retina and sciatic nerve) in the two n-3 fatty acid dietary groups relative to controls. Corresponding changes were also found in the 22:5n-3 contents of these tissues, whereas little or no significant elevation in DHA (22:6n-3) was found. In contrast, the percentages by weight of the n-6 fatty acids including 18:2n-6, 20:4n-6 (arachidonic acid, AA), 22:4n-6 and 22:5n-6 were generally lower in the various phospholipids/tissues of the animals given fish oil or the n-3 fatty acid concentrate; the levels of 22:5n-6 and 22:4n-6 were markedly affected in this regard. These results indicate that dietary n-3 fatty acids (as EPA plus DHA) can greatly affect the fatty acid compositions of the various membrane phospholipids in nervous tissues within a relatively short time. These biochemical alterations may be important for functional changes including altered membrane fluidity, cellular responses, ion transport and the biosyntheses of AA- and EPA-derived prostaglandins and leukotrienes.\r"

When fed the palmitoyl glycerol, mice less than 6 wk old show a pronounced hypothermia that is prevented by adding safflower oil to the diet. A more moderate degree of hypothermia is seen with older animals. Once body temperature fell below 28 degrees C, replacing the toxic monoacylglycerol with safflower oil and/or raising the environmental temperature to 34 degrees C did not reverse the ultimate fatality caused by palmitoyl glycerol ingestion. If hypothermia was between 28 and 32 degrees C, high mortality was not reversed by feeding the unsaturated fat or raising the environmental temperature to 34 degrees C. However, a combination of both treatments reduced the mortality. Irrespective of body temperature, the hypothermia was eliminated by the warm ambient temperature, but mortality was high. Thus, although hypothermia is a sign of the toxicity of rac-1(3)-palmitoyl glycerol, it is not the immediate cause of death.\r"

After an overnight fast, animals were given a single duodenal dose of an aqueous emulsion containing one of the following: oleic acid, corn oil, menhaden oil or a fish oil concentrate (FOC) and [1,2-3H]cholesterol. Digestion and absorption were estimated by recovering the total fatty acids in the thoracic duct lymph over a 24-h collection period (after subtraction of the \"baseline\" endogenous fatty acids in the lymph). Cholesterol absorption in the thoracic duct lymph was significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) in the presence of menhaden oil or FOC compared to that in the presence of corn oil. With various fat feedings, the major increases in lymph fatty acids were directly related to the dietary fatty acid content. The relative amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (AA) in the thoracic lymph were influenced by the lipid content of the emulsion. The EPA/AA ratio in control, oleic acid and corn oil feedings ranged from 0.12 to 0.25. When marine oil was administered, the EPA/AA ratio was 0.78-0.98. The total amount of fatty acids found in the lymph after marine oil feeding was significantly less (P less than 0.01) than that found after corn oil feeding. The results suggested that the digestion and absorption of menhaden oil and FOC were decreased as compared with corn oil. The EPA/AA ratio was increased in the thoracic lymph after dietary fish oil feeding.\r"

The model was capable of accurately describing the entire response curve of rats fed diets containing each of the three protein sources. Incorporation of a technique known as parameter sharing into the curve-fitting process facilitated convergence of the parameter estimates for b (the response of rats fed a protein-free diet) and Rmax (maximum response) for all curves when compared with the values observed experimentally. Parameter sharing also provided a method by which the curves could be differentiated on a statistical basis. These data indicate that the relative value of a protein source is dependent on the concentration of the protein in the diet. The application of nonlinear models combined with parameter sharing provides a technique by which protein values can be evaluated at levels of animal response from maintenance to maximum growth.\r"

Xanthine oxidase activity changed in liver and intestinal mucosa in response to protein and iron, but immunologically detectable xanthine oxidase protein did not change. When total liver RNA isolated from these rats was translated by a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, we found no difference in the amount of xanthine oxidase that was translated. These results demonstrated that the changes in xanthine oxidase activity were not accompanied by changes in the amount of protein. Since xanthine oxidase can exist in an inactive desulfo form, we asked if xanthine oxidase activity was changed by the content of sulfur-containing amino acids in the diet. Xanthine oxidase activity in intestinal mucosa of the rats fed the 5% casein + methionine diet was significantly greater than that of the rats fed the 5% casein diet alone. These findings suggest that xanthine oxidase activity may be regulated by interconversion of active and inactive desulfo enzyme.\r"

No differences in 65Zn uptake due to gut segment position were observed in the pigs. A Zn source x PA interaction was observed for 65Zn uptake into the pig gut tissue and for 65Zn uptake to the serosal side of the gut sacs. Total 65Zn absorption in the pig gut sacs from the two Zn sources was not different, but the addition of a 5 M ratio of PA to Zn depressed 65Zn absorption. No differences were observed in total 65Zn absorption or 65Zn uptake in poultry gut sac tissue. There was, however, greater uptake of 65Zn from ZnCl2 to the serosal side of the sacs than from ZnMet.

On d 17 of lactation, dams were separated from litters and given intraperitoneal injections of [3',5',7,9-3H]pteroylmonoglutamic acid ([3H]PteGlu) or physiological saline. Mean [3H]PteGlu incorporation into milk of severely iron-deficient dams was 67% of that in iron-sufficient controls, while \"total\" and \"free\" milk folate activities were 54 and 61%, respectively. Values for milk [3H]PteGlu incorporation and folate activities were intermediate in moderately iron-depleted dams. Pup red blood cell folate activity was positively correlated with both free (r = 0.43, P = 0.004) and total (r = 0.37, P = 0.015) milk folate activities. Mean plasma folate activities of severely and moderately iron-deficient pups were 68 and 86% of control values, respectively. Results show that in both mild and severe iron deficiency, reduced folate secretion into milk is at least partially responsible for impaired folate status of suckling pups.\r"

  ".W": "Voluntary intake of protein, fat and carbohydrate (CHO) was modified by feeding young rats either a control purified diet [% metabolizable energy (ME): protein 21, fat 7, CHO 72], a control diet plus sucrose solution (20%) to drink (final intakes 17, 6 and 77% ME as protein, fat and CHO, respectively) or a low protein diet substituted with either CHO (8, 7 and 85% ME as protein, fat and CHO, respectively) or fat (8, 20 and 72% ME as protein, fat and CHO, respectively). Total ME intakes corrected for body size were similar for all rats, but body weight, energy gain and net energetic efficiency were lower in both low protein-fed groups than in the control group. The acute thermogenic response (% rise in oxygen consumption) to a standard balanced-nutrient meal was higher (12%) in sucrose-supplemented and in low protein groups (15-16%) than in control rats (8%). Brown adipose tissue protein content and thermogenic capacity (assessed from purine nucleotide binding to isolated mitochondria) were greater than control values in sucrose-fed and protein-deficient animals, and the greatest levels of activity were seen in low protein-fed rats with a high fat intake. The results demonstrate that the changes in energy balance, thermogenesis and brown adipose tissue activity that result from protein deficiency cannot be ascribed to changes in the level of energy intake or to a specific increase in the amount or proportion of either CHO or fat. They suggest that the protein-to-energy ratio must be the primary influence on thermogenesis and brown fat activity in these animals.\r"

Type of dietary protein did not influence concentrations of a) cholesterol in plasma, b) low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, c) high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or d) cholesterol in several organs of pigs. Pigs fed tallow had greater concentrations of plasma cholesterol and LDL and HDL cholesterol than did pigs fed soybean oil. Ratios of HDL to LDL were not altered by dietary fat. Cholesterol concentrations were greater in heart, skeletal muscle and viscera of pigs fed soybean oil than in those fed tallow. Plasma cholesterol varied reciprocally with cholesterol in several tissues. Thus, dietary beef and soy protein isolate had similar effects on cholesterol concentrations in plasma, LDL, HDL and organs, whether pigs consumed soybean oil or beef tallow as a major fat source. Soybean oil, however, exerted a hypocholesterolemic effect, irrespective of major source of dietary protein.\r"

Three male and two female subjects participated in the 10-d study. Subjects consumed an L-amino acid diet containing 0.74 g protein equivalent/kg body weight on d 1-5; these amino acid concentrations were doubled on d 6-10. The diet was devoid of arginine on d 3-8. Daily urine was collected and blood samples were drawn on 6 of the 10 d at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after the breakfast meal. When arginine was removed from the diet, urinary orotic acid did not increase, in contrast to what has been reported in most other animal species tested. Plasma ammonium concentrations remained within normal limits throughout the study. A small postprandial decrease in plasma arginine concentration was observed when the arginine-deficient diet was consumed; this decline disappeared when the diet was resupplied with arginine. The results of this study suggest that over the short term the adult human's capacity for de novo arginine synthesis when fed a dietary deficiency of arginine is sufficient for the maintenance of normal cellular metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets containing corn gluten meal (CGM), Mormon cricket meal (MCM), MCM supplemented with methionine (MCM + Met) or CGM-MCM mixtures as the sole source of dietary protein in purified diets. Animal response (weight or nitrogen gain) was analyzed as a function of nitrogen intake and described by a series of curves using a four-parameter logistic model. Parameter sharing was used to differentiate statistically between the response curves. When used for maximum nitrogen retention the quality of the protein sources could be ranked as follows: MCM + Met greater than 40 CGM-60 MCM greater than 50 CGM-50 MCM greater than 60 CGM-40 MCM greater than MCM greater than CGM. When used for maximum weight gain the ranking was as follows: MCM + Met greater than 40 CGM-60 MCM greater than 50 CGM-50 MCM greater than 60 CGM-40 MCM greater than MCM greater than CGM. The rankings of the protein sources when used for weight maintenance or nitrogen equilibrium were similar to those seen for maximum weight or nitrogen gain except for the ranking of MCM, which changed from fifth to first. These results show MCM to be a good quality protein source and that methionine is the first limiting amino acid when used for growth but not for maintenance. The shape of the response curves was dependent upon the response criteria as well as the source of dietary protein. The factors that may affect the shape of the dose-response curves and the application of nonlinear models toward animal feeding programs are discussed.\r"

Although the rats consumed most of the food presented, their body weight started to decrease rapidly from about d 700 of age in group 80 and gradually from d 600 in group 50. On d 800 their body weights had decreased significantly (17% in group 80 and 11% in group 50). These decreases in weight were not due to decreased digestibility of the food, and in both groups a positive nitrogen balance was maintained on d 800 and the relative proportion of body protein was not different from that on d 600. In both groups, daily energy expenditure was significantly higher on d 800 than on d 600 because of an increase in the basal metabolic rate, not in physical activity, and consequently these balances were negative on d 800. From these results, it is concluded that the primary cause of the decrease in body weight in later life of aging rats consuming a constant amount of food is increased expenditure of energy.\r"

At slaughter, the stomach, small and large intestine and cecum were excised, emptied and freed from fat. Lengths and pre- and post-defatting weights were measured. Portions of tissues were homogenized and analyzed for protein, pepsin, maltase, RNA and DNA. Pregnancy had no effect on the weights of the different components of the gastrointestinal tract. Liver and small intestine weights were larger in lactating sows than in the CL group. Sows nursing 12 piglets had heavier livers than those nursing 8. The fundic mucosa of the latter had higher total pepsin activity and total protein and RNA contents than that of L12 sows. LHED sows had heavier small intestine and lower total pepsin content of the fundic mucosa than LLED sows.\r"

During lactation, food intake of the pups was reduced by limiting intake of the mother to 50% of controls. After weaning, pups received 40% of ad libitum intakes until 120 d of age. From 120 to 316 d, all animals were fed ad libitum. At 120 d, body weight of the R group was 41% of C and muscle and adipose weights were 54 and 16% of C, respectively. Muscle DNA in the R group was 47% of C, but protein-to-DNA ratio was normal. Fiber number was not different between C and R groups; however, muscle length and fiber cross-sectional area were 85 and 64%, respectively, of C values. After 196 d of recovery, weights of the body, skeletal muscles and adipose tissues averaged 76, 84 and 51% of C values, respectively. Recovery of skeletal muscle paralleled the recovery of fiber cross-sectional area (84%) and DNA content (86%). Daily injections of 100 micrograms of growth hormone from 120 to 148 d produced no additional recovery. This study establishes that growth retardation of skeletal muscle is associated with reductions in the development of cross-sectional area and DNA content of muscle fibers.\r"

Although egg weight and percent of cracked eggs were higher and egg production and shell density (mg/cm2) were lower (significantly, P less than 0.01) in aged hens, shell weight, plasma Ca and duodenal and egg shell gland calbindin were similar to those of young hens. Dietary Ca restriction reduced shell weight, shell density and structural bone and plasma Ca in both the young and aged birds. The production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3] and its concentration in the plasma were higher in hens fed low dietary levels of Ca than in hens fed normal Ca levels only in the younger hens. However, a slightly higher production of 1,25(OH)2D3 and concentration of duodenal calbindin were also observed in severely Ca-restricted (1.4% Ca for 19 d) aged hens than in the younger hens. The results suggest that the aged hen loses its ability to adapt to changes in Ca intake or needs through mechanisms involving modulation of vitamin D metabolism.\r"

In some groups, 500 mg zinc/L was added to the drinking water (500 ppm) with or after cadmium treatment. The number of direct and indirect splenic plaque-forming cells was higher in cadmium-treated mice at 0 wk than in untreated controls. Concurrent zinc administration prevented the enhancement of plaque-forming cell response. Proliferative response of spleen cell culture to the T-cell mitogens phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A was slightly high in cadmium-treated mice at 0 wk and zinc administered after exposure to cadmium tended to lower it. The number of Lyt-2 positive cells in the spleen was lower and the ratio of L3T4 to Lyt-2 positive cells, reflecting the balance of immunoregulatory T-lymphocytes, was higher after cadmium treatment than in untreated controls. Concurrent zinc administration prevented the alteration of T-cell subsets. Cadmium and zinc treatment had no effect on liver, kidney, spleen and thymus weights and lymphocyte content of spleen, thymus and peripheral blood. Use of immunofluorescence with anti-mouse IgG and C3 showed no evidence of an autoimmune reaction in kidney sections. Liver and kidney cadmium concentrations were high at all observation times in the cadmium-treated animals. Tissue cadmium levels were lower in mice treated with both zinc and cadmium than in those treated with cadmium alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was no noticeable change in mRNA levels within 4 h of refeeding by gavage with a casein hydrolysate suspension supplemented with L-tryptophan and L-arginine. Upon refeeding a 30% protein diet, mRNA levels returned to normal after 3 d. The work presented here suggests that changes observed in the protein synthetic rate following protein depletion and repletion are due to changes in mRNA levels altered as a consequence of the availability of dietary protein.\r"

  ".W": "To pursue the mechanism underlying dietary induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in rat liver, changes in free-polysome-associated messenger RNA (mRNA) activity for the enzyme were studied in rats fed diets containing either casein or zein. The enzyme activity increased 50- to 100-fold in 4 h after feeding a 50% casein diet. Changes in the amount of immunoreactive ODC protein roughly paralleled changes in the enzyme activity. Dietary casein was found to cause a several fold increase in polysomal mRNA activity coding for this enzyme, which preceded the increase in catalytic activity. Therefore, the induction of hepatic ODC by casein feeding is due partly to an increase in the activity of its mRNA associated with free polysomes and partly to some translational and/or posttranslational control. On the other hand, feeding the zein diet hardly increased ODC activity, immunoreactive ODC protein or free-polysomal ODC-mRNA activity. This indicates that adequate supply and balance of amino acids are required both for the increase in polysome-associated ODC-mRNA activity and for the translational and/or posttranslational mechanism(s) during the induction of hepatic ODC activity.\r"

Problems included speech impairment, learning disabilities, emotional disturbance, mental retardation, sensory disorders, and physical and health disabilities. Overall, 4.5% of the children's problems were identified at birth, and only 28.7% before the age of 5 years. Variation in age at identification depended on the condition: 1 year for Down syndrome and cerebral palsy versus a 6-year range for mental retardation. Although physicians were most likely to identify the less common, more severe handicaps, they also identified from 15% to 25% of learning disabilities, speech impairments, emotional disorders, hyperactivity, and \"other\" development problems. The type, severity, and complexity of the condition were significant predictors of physician identification. No racial, socioeconomic, or site biases were associated with whether a physician was first to identify. Age at identification was predicted by the complexity of the problem, the association with other health and developmental concerns, socioeconomic indicators, and whether a physician was involved in the diagnosis. In the absence of clear assumption of responsibility for early identification, much terrain remains uncharted by medical practitioners and the schools. A better systematic sharing of responsibility for the early identification of developmentally disabling conditions is needed.\r"

Seventeen patients had recessive PKD; six had dominant PKD. Eighteen patients had insufficient data to categorize the type of PKD with certainty. Seven patients were classified as \"other\"; three had glomerulocystic disease and the remainder had multiple malformation syndromes or tuberous sclerosis. Renal ultrasonography and excretory urography accurately detected 15 of 17 patients with recessive PKD, but only one patient with dominant PKD was correctly diagnosed by excretory urography. The majority of patients in all groups required antihypertensive therapy. The 17 children with recessive PKD have been followed up for 6.1 +/- 4.3 (SD) years. Eight patients are doing well. Two patients have died; five others have required treatment for renal failure. Only one patient has an estimated glomerular filtration rate within the normal range after 6 years of age. Long-term evaluation of most of the patients with dominant PKD is not yet available; however, by age 42 months one patient has required dialysis. To provide optimum genetic counseling and accurate diagnosis for patients with PKD, a combination of careful family evaluation, radiography, and liver or kidney biopsy is required. The outcome of patients who survive the neonatal period appears not to be so grim as previously feared, underscoring the importance of aggressive supportive care and the need for physician and family education.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of coronary obstruction subsequent to giant coronary aneurysm in Kawasaki disease was studied. In 20 cases, aneurysms with a maximal diameter greater than 8 mm were identified by coronary angiography 2 to 120 months (mean 16.9 months) after onset. There were 25 giant aneurysms among these 20 patients, all of whom underwent coronary angiography between 12 and 134 months (mean 31.7 months) after initial examination. Coronary obstruction occurred in six cases (30.0%), all within 4 years of onset of disease. There were five obstructive aneurysms in the right coronary artery (5/12; 41.7%) and two in the left coronary artery (2/13; 15.4%). One of these patients developed symptomatic myocardial infarction. Two had abnormal electrocardiographic findings suggesting myocardial infarction. In five cases, persistent perfusion defects were found by myocardial imaging. On the other hand, in two patients giant aneurysms persisted without obstructive changes for greater than 10 years. In both cases the aneurysm was in the left coronary artery and obstruction of the right coronary artery was found at initial angiography. These results seem to indicate the limited efficacy of antiplatelet therapy for giant coronary aneurysms in Kawasaki disease and that giant aneurysms are likely to progress to become obstructive within a few years even if antiplatelet therapy is given. Other forms of treatment, including surgery, should therefore be considered in such patients.\r"

The examinations were performed initially within 1 hour after delivery and serially for 3 days. The two-dimensionally derived long-axis plane of the DA disclosed a characteristic localized protrusion into its lumen in 30% of the subjects within 1 hour, in 80% by 4 hours, in 96% by 8 hours, and in all by 24 hours after birth. In 10 infants in whom the intraluminal protrusion did not appear within 4 hours after birth, none had any recognizable changes in the inner diameter or length of the DA during this initial period. The development of the intraluminal protrusion resulted in localized narrowing of the ductal lumen. Doppler echocardiography revealed a high-velocity jet within and downstream from the narrowed portion of the DA. Thereafter, ductal narrowing progressed along the entire length. The intraluminal protrusion may be early evidence of ductal changes leading to eventual functional and anatomic closure.\r"

  ".W": "During 1979 and 1980, 351 infants of birth weight 500 to 999 g were born in the State of Victoria: 89 (25.4%) survived to the age of 2 years corrected for prematurity, and 83 were fully assessed by a multidisciplinary team; partial data were obtained on the remainder. At the age of 5 years, corrected for prematurity, 85/89 (96%) were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, although not all children could be fully evaluated by the psychologists. Reports were available for another three children; one child was untraced. Of the survivors able to be classified at 5 years, 59/82 (72%) had no functional handicap. Functional handicaps was severe in 16 (19%), moderate in four (5%), and mild in three (4%). Functional handicaps were present in 50% (8/16) of outborn survivors compared with the 23% (15/66) for the inborn survivors (P = 0.02). Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in eight children at 5 years and in 12 children at 2 years. The diagnosis was stable for the children not ambulant at 2 years; five of seven 2-year-old children with mild cerebral palsy had \"outgrown\" the diagnosis by 5 years, but ataxic cerebral palsy was not identified in one child until 5 years. Six children were blind; four had severe sensorineural or mixed deafness, one more than at 2 years. Of 82 children assessed according to identical criteria for functional handicap at both 2 and 5 years, 52 (63%) remained in the same category at 5 years, three (4%) were judged to be more severely handicapped, and 27 (33%) were less severely handicapped. The 2-year evaluation of extremely low birth weight children often proved to be unduly pessimistic, for many showed improvement or recovery from functional handicaps and impairments by 5 years of age.\r"

In each component of the multiple schedule subjects were required to complete a different sequence of 10 responses in a predetermined order using three keys of a numeric keypad. In the acquisition component a new response sequence had to be acquired each session. In the performance component the response sequence remained the same from session to session. The higher doses of ethanol (67 g) and diazepam (20 and 40 mg) increased overall percent errors above placebo levels; the lower doses of these compounds had no significant effect. The increases in percent errors were selective across the two schedule components. Ethanol increased percent errors significantly only in the acquisition component. Diazepam increased percent errors significantly in the acquisition component at a lower dose (20 mg) than was necessary to increase errors in the performance component (40 mg). Ethanol (67 g) and diazepam (40 mg) decreased overall response rates as an orderly function of dose. In contrast to the percent errors measure, the effects on response rates were not significantly different across the performance and acquisition components. Peak effects on percent errors and response rates varied between 30 and 70 min and 45 and 80 min postdrug for ethanol and diazepam, respectively, and the duration of effects of the higher doses was greater than 3 hr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The sympathetic nervous system has been hypothesized to coordinate the timing of cellular development in peripheral tissues. In the current study, we evaluated the relationships among the ontogeny of sympathetic projections to peripheral organs, the patterns of macromolecule synthesis in those organs and the reactivity of synthetic processes to beta adrenergic stimulation by isoproterenol. The major developmental rise in norepinephrine concentration and turnover, as well as in numbers of beta receptors, occurred during the second to fourth postnatal weeks in renal and lung sympathetic pathways and slightly earlier in the cardiac-sympathetic axis. The developmental decline in DNA synthesis in heart, kidney and lung coincided with the maturation of sympathetic projections. Direct stimulation of beta receptors by the in vivo administration of isoproterenol caused acute reductions in DNA synthesis in an age-dependent manner. In the heart, isoproterenol was first able to suppress DNA synthesis at 5 days of age and a maximal effect was seen at 9 days; this early phase was characterized by a rapid time constant of coupling of beta receptors to the DNA effect (maximal effect at 6 h after isoproterenol). Reactivity was lessened by 12 days of age and thereafter displayed a longer time constant (maximal effect at 12-24 h). Reactivity of DNA synthesis to isoproterenol challenge was slightly different in kidney and lung (detectable by 2 days of age), but bore similar developmental characteristics to the pattern in the heart (peak of reactivity at 9 days and a decline in reactivity and lengthening of the time constant after 16 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The binding and pharmacologic response of a series of 1,4-dihydropyridine analogs were examined in rabbit myocardium. [3H]Nitrendipine was used to label specific binding sites in myocardial membrane particulates and displacement experiments were carried out with the unlabeled analogs to determine their IC50 values. Binding of [3H]nitrendipine could be characterized by a Kd of 0.15 +/- 0.06 nM and a maximum number of binding sites of 247 +/- 150 fmol/mg of protein. Saturation binding experiments performed with higher concentrations of [3H]nitrendipine did not reveal the presence of a lower affinity site. Binding IC50 values of 12 unlabeled 1,4-dihydropyridine analogs ranged from 4.3 X 10(-10) M to 1.32 X 10(-6) M. The negative inotropic effect of the same compounds was studied in vitro in isolated papillary muscles and the IC50 values for inhibition of contraction determined. There was a statistically significant correlation between the IC50 values for binding and response (r = 0.79, P less than .005; rs = 0.78, P less than .005). Consistent with previous studies with several of these compounds, the response IC50 value for each compound was greater than the binding IC50 value. For most of the compounds, this difference was from one to two orders of magnitude. For three compounds, nitrendipine, nimodipine and nicardipine, this difference reached three orders of magnitude. These three dihydropyridine analogs share structural features that may determine their low myocardial potency and, at the same time, their high vascular smooth muscle potency. Elucidation of these structural features may be useful in determining which analogs will have the highest vascular smooth muscle selectivity.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the cardiovascular actions of magnesium in neurally intact animals, magnesium chloride (1-4 mM/min) administered i.v., producing a peak arterial magnesium level between 4.7 and 7.2 mg/dl, was given to alpha-chloralose-anesthetized, open-chest dogs. Magnesium lowered heart rate by 36 +/- 11 beats/min (P less than .05), cardiac output by 0.7 +/- 0.2 liters/min (P less than .05), left ventricular (LV) peak dP/dt by 410 +/- 96 mm Hg/sec (P less than .05) and aortic and pulmonary artery pressures, but it did not change LV end-diastolic pressure, systemic resistance or pulmonary resistance. Coronary blood flow also decreased by 39 +/- 11% (P less than .05), myocardial oxygen consumption by 88 +/- 22% (P less than .05) and myocardial oxygen extraction by 53 +/- 16% (P less than .05). When heart rate was held constant, magnesium still decreased LV systolic pressure, LV peak dP/dt and coronary blood flow. The increase in serum magnesium was accompanied by an increase in serum calcium (by 1.4 +/- 0.2 mg/dl; P less than .05) and a fall in serum potassium (by 0.21 +/- 0.1 mEq/l), but not by a change in serum sodium, myocardial electrolyte arteriovenous differences or arterial pH. Thus, at blood concentrations that are observed in humans after therapeutic dosages of magnesium, a depression of cardiac performance is observed in the anesthetized dog. Although magnesium produces a fall in coronary blood flow, this appears to be due at least in part to a decrease in myocardial oxygen requirements because myocardial oxygen extraction also decreases. Rapid changes in serum electrolytes accompany these hemodynamic effects.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of two classes of drugs, steroids and salicylates, on MTX synovial fluid concentrations. A novel canine model of monoarticular inflammation was used, in which each animal served as its own control with both inflamed and normal knees in the same animal. After the 6-week immunization process, animals in each group received either no drug (control), prednisone or aspirin (low dose and high dose) for 1 week before MTX. On the day of the study, each animal was given i.v. MTX, and serial serum and synovial fluid samples were obtained. Laboratory, histologic and clinical observations supported the presence of monoarticular inflammation. The end-of-infusion synovial MTX concentration in inflamed knees was significantly greater than in normal knees (P less than .05), but, 2 hr after the end of infusion, they were not different. The end-of-infusion ratio of synovial fluid MTX concentration to serum MTX concentration (both total and unbound) was significantly lower in the prednisone group than in the other treatment groups (P less than .05). The end-of-infusion ratio of the MTX synovial concentration in the inflamed knee compared with the normal knee at 2 hr was significantly lower in the prednisone group than in the other three treatment groups (P less than .05). These results have therapeutic implications for the use of MTX in treating rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Severity of withdrawal showed a negative correlation (r = -0.93, P less than .001) with the falling phase of plasma morphine. It may be concluded that, under the conditions of this experiment, significant morphine withdrawal symptoms arose despite measurable plasma concentrations of morphine and that the relationship between plasma concentrations and withdrawal may be quantified according to a linear pharmacokinetic model for a given chronic dose (3.0 mg/kg q 6 hr) of morphine.\r"

Cocaine concentrations in the brain reached peak values within 5 min after administration of cocaine. At all time points between 5 and 60 min the concentrations of cocaine in the brain were 7-fold higher, on the average, than those in plasma. The opposite was true for the concentrations of benzoylecgonine; brain to plasma ratios of benzoylecgonine were approximately 0.1 from 5 to 30 min after i.p. cocaine injection. After i.p. injection of either 10 or 25 mg/kg of cocaine, cocaine disappeared from plasma and brain with a half-life of 16 min and benzoylecgonine disappeared from plasma with a half-life of 62 min. There was good correspondence between locomotor stimulation and concentration of cocaine in the brain measured at 12, 22 and 32 min after i.p. administration of 25 mg/kg of cocaine. Among individual animals there was a significant correlation between their locomotor stimulation and their brain cocaine concentration, indicating that differences in cocaine levels in the brain between animals contribute to their different behavioral response; however, the correlation analysis also indicated the role of other factors determining the locomotor response to cocaine.\r"

Because the placental Na+-H+ exchanger was the most sensitive to inhibition by loperamide (IC50 = 60 microM), characterization of the inhibition was done with the placental Na+-H+ exchanger. The inhibition of the placental Na+-H+ exchanger by loperamide was instantaneous and freely reversible. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that the inhibition was of a mixed type. Loperamide (70 microM) reduced the maximal velocity (Vmax) from 46.4 +/- 1.2 to 34.5 +/- 1.1 nmol/mg of protein/15 s and increased the apparent affinity constant (Kt) for Na+ from 12.3 +/- 1.0 to 16.5 +/- 1.5 mM. Loperamide interacted with the exchanger protein at more than one site. The effects of loperamide were not antagonized by naloxone, suggesting the noninvolvement of opiate receptors in this process. These results differentiate loperamide from other Na+-H+ exchanger inhibitors such as amiloride, cimetidine and clonidine, which interact with the exchanger at a single site in a strictly competitive manner.\r"

When the atypical antidepressant maprotiline was administered (10 mg/kg i.p. twice daily for 3 weeks), no change in the density of GABAB recognition sites was observed using either [3H]GABA or [3H](-)-baclofen as ligands. In addition, a protracted treatment with imipramine, desmethylimipramine and maprotiline failed to change GABAB receptor-coupled signal transduction as monitored by the ability of (-)-baclofen to inhibit the forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in membranes prepared from frontal cortex and hippocampus or the cyclic AMP formation in slices from frontal cortex. Hence, after protracted antidepressant treatment, the increase of [3H]GABA binding may not reflect changes in the characteristics of the recognition sites of the GABAB receptors subclass coupled to the adenylate cyclase through a guanine nucleotide binding protein inhibitory (Ni).\r"

To determine whether this chlorpromazine-calmodulin (CPZ-CaM) complex can inhibit the actions of native calmodulin, we examined its effects on the activity of calmodulin-sensitive cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from rat brain and on the Ca++-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) of human erythrocyte membranes. The CPZ-CaM complex was prepared by irradiating purified bovine brain calmodulin in the presence of chlorpromazine and Ca++. The sample was then dialyzed extensively to remove reversibly bound chlorpromazine and then assayed for its ability to activate calmodulin-sensitive phosphodiesterase and Ca++-ATPase, and for its ability to block the stimulatory effects of native calmodulin on these enzymes. The CPZ-CaM complex had no effect on the basal activity of either enzyme; it neither activated nor inhibited the enzymes when assayed in the absence of calmodulin. However, it affected differentially the activation of the two enzymes by native calmodulin. The CPZ-CaM complex totally inhibited calmodulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase but had no effect on the activation of the ATPase by calmodulin. Other studies showed that CPZ-CaM increased the activation constant (Ka) for the interaction of calmodulin with phosphodiesterase but did not affect the maximal activation (Vmax) of the enzyme by calmodulin. Neither calmodulin nor CPZ-CaM altered the Km for the interaction between phosphodiesterase and cyclic AMP. These results suggest that CPZ-CaM inhibits the calmodulin-induced activation of phosphodiesterase by competing with calmodulin for regulatory sites on the enzyme and not by interacting with calmodulin itself or by blocking the interaction of cyclic AMP with the enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In humans, TPMT activity is controlled by a common genetic polymorphism. C57BL/6J (B6) and AKR/J (AK) inbred mice have low hepatic and renal TPMT activities, whereas DBA/2J (D2) mice have high enzyme activities. Low TPMT activity is inherited in these mice as an autosomal recessive trait. The properties of TPMT in liver homogenates from B6, AK and D2 mice were compared in order to study the biochemical basis for inherited differences in TPMT activity among these strains. Biochemical and physical properties of hepatic TPMT were very similar in all three strains. Apparent Michaelis (Km) constants for 6-mercaptopurine were 0.98, 0.75 and 1.1 mM for B6, AK and D2 mice, respectively. Apparent Km values for S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the methyl donor for the reaction, were 2.2, 1.5 and 3.0 microM for B6, AK and D2 mice.

Half-life and slope values for thermal inactivation of hepatic TPMT were similar among B6, AK and D2 mice. No differences among strains in Rf values of the enzyme activity after electrophoresis were detected.

AMI produced marked resting block that was enhanced at low holding potentials, findings consistent with a shift in the steady-state INa availability curve to more negative potentials (-16 +/- 3 mV). Resting block was not associated with any change in the time course of INa decay during a depolarizing clamp step. AMI also produced use-dependent block in conjunction with increases in rate (0.5-5.0 Hz) and pulse duration (2-200 msec). These changes are consistent with a slowing of the recovery from inactivation of the sodium channel. Brief depolarizing pulses produced little use-dependent block, suggesting that the onset of drug-induced block is slow. Thus, AMI blocks INa and shifts the availability curve in isolated myocytes, both of which contribute to the net tonic block. The results suggest that both rested state and inactivated state sodium channel block are factors in AMI's antiarrhythmic efficacy.\r"

The present study documents that stimulation of GABAA receptors located on chromaffin cell membranes of canine adrenal glands, eliciting depolarization of chromaffin cell membranes, modulates the responsiveness of chromaffin cells to splanchnic nerve stimulation. 4,5,6,7-Tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (0.143 mmol/2 ml/min), a selective GABAA receptor agonist infused into the aortic pouch, increases the release of ME-like peptides and catecholamines into the adrenal effluent blood. Prior infusion into the aortic pouch of the GABAA receptor blocker, bicuculline (0.05 mmol/2 ml/min), prevents the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol-elicited release of both substances. A stoichiometric relationship exists between the release of both substances; 1 nmol/ml of plasma of catecholamines was coreleased with 2 pmol/ml of plasma of ME-like peptides. The chromatographic profile on a Sephadex G-75 column indicates that, after injection of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol, various MW forms of ME-like peptides are released into the adrenal effluent blood. A similar profile for the release of ME-like peptides was obtained when electrical stimulation (10 V/6 Hz) of the splanchnic nerve was used as a stimulus. These data suggest that direct stimulation of GABAA receptors causes depolarization of chromaffin cell membranes by a burst of Cl- channel opening and triggers neurotransmitter release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Allyl alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity was more severe in old male rats than in young-adult male rats, as measured by release of hepatic enzymes from injured cells and loss of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450. The extent of toxicity in female rats was greater than in males and was unaffected by aging. The purpose of this study was to examine possible causes for these differences. The activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) with allyl alcohol as substrate was measured in liver cytosolic fractions of rats at ages representing young adulthood, middle age and old age. ADH activities were 1.7 +/- 0.1, 2.3 +/- 0.1 and 2.6 +/- 0.1 mumol/min/g of liver in male rats aged 4, 14 and 25 months, respectively. ADH activities in young-adult and old female rats were 3.8 +/- 0.1 and 3.7 +/- 0.1 mumol/min/g of liver. There was a good correlation (r = 0.99, P less than .001) between liver ADH activity and allyl alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity, measured as the release of sorbitol dehydrogenase into the bloodstream. Cytosolic free NAD+/NADH ratios in male rats were not significantly different among the three age groups; the ratios were lowest in young-adult female rats. Low Km aldehyde dehydrogenase activities in liver mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were similar among the three age groups of male rats, and the activities in female rats were not substantially different. The results indicated that increased ADH activity is the principal cause of the age-associated enhancement of allyl alcohol hepatotoxicity in male rats.\r"

An isolated tissue bioassay using anterior byssus retractor muscle was prepared according to standard procedures and the isometric tension produced in response to ACh was measured. Ten millimolar Ni++, Co++ or Cd++ reduced the maximum contracture response to ACh in zero-Ca medium in a time-dependent manner. The inhibition was reversed upon restoration of medium containing 10 mM Ca++. The loss (and re-establishment) of contracture response to ACh corresponded to the influx (and efflux) of the heavy metal ions opposite to the direction of Ca++ flow. These results are consistent with the concept that the loss of the ACh contracture response is attributable to the displacement of tissue Ca++ from release sites by heavy metals.\r"

Opioid agonists, including opioid derivatives of proenkephalin and prodynorphin, caused direct tonic and indirect phasic contractions of strips from the circular muscle layer of rat colon. Both contractile responses appeared to be mediated by preferential interaction with delta opioid receptors. Elimination of most, if not all, neural input with tetrodotoxin (TTX) induced concentration-dependent phasic contractions. Neutralization of background vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) with VIP antiserum induced phasic contractions in previously quiescent muscle strips. The effect of VIP antiserum was concentration-dependent in the range of 1:960 to 1:60. A threshold concentration of VIP antiserum (1:960) increased the sensitivity of the phasic responses to [Met]enkephalin (100-fold) and TTX (20-fold) whereas exogenous VIP had the opposite effect. [Met]enkephalin and TTX inhibited basal VIP release by 43 +/- 8% (P less than .001) and 65 +/- 13% (P less than .01), respectively. It was concluded that VIP was the neurotransmitter responsible for the dominant inhibitory neural input to intestinal circular muscle and that opioid peptides induce phasic contractions by suppressing VIP release.\r"

Simultaneously, lidocaine induced a transient but more pronounced decrease in verapamil plasma concentration of 48% from 60 +/- 3 ng/ml. This pharmacokinetic interaction was not the result of a lidocaine-induced decrease in the fraction of verapamil bound to plasma protein because in vitro lidocaine failed to displace verapamil from its protein binding site. Moreover, an increase in verapamil total clearance was not the only mechanism because steady-state lidocaine (6 mg/kg over 5 min followed by 60 micrograms/kg/min) in the presence of steady-state verapamil (200 micrograms/kg over 3 min followed by 3 micrograms/kg/min) also resulted in a transient decrease in verapamil plasma concentration from 59 +/- 9 to 23 +/- 2 ng/ml in six conscious dogs. Although verapamil did not affect lidocaine pharmacokinetics, in the presence of the steady-state lidocaine we recorded an increase in verapamil initial volume of distribution of 44% from 40 +/- 4 liters, and intercompartmental clearance increased by 88% from 101 +/- 20 liters/hr, combined with an increase in verapamil total clearance of 47% from 54 +/- 6 liters/hr (n = 6).\r"

Induction of drug metabolism by 8-MOP was studied in vivo in rats pretreated with 50 mg/kg/day of 8-MOP for 3 days and given an i.v. injection of CA, HB, DPH or HPPH 24 hr after their last pretreatment. This regimen increased the clearance of CA from 0.25 +/- 0.02 liters/kg/hr in controls to 1.08 +/- 0.04 liters/kg/hr in pretreated rats but had no significant effect on the elimination of HB, DPH and HPPH. Thus, acutely, 8-MOP is a potent, nonselective inhibitor of phase-1 metabolism in vivo. In contrast, chronically, it is a specific inducer of the metabolism of CA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The birds received one injection and then were tested daily for a period of up to 10 weeks. Trimethyltin produced increases in total errors within sessions, as well as decreases in rates of responding. Analysis of the pattern of error elimination within sessions suggested that error elimination did take place after trimethyltin administration in all birds, but that errors frequently were eliminated more slowly than in control birds.

There was a heterogeneous response among neurons to PL 017, DPLPE and DYN A inasmuch as 21.4% of neurons responded to all three agonists, 35.7% responded to PL 017 and DYN A, 35.7% responded only to PL 017 and 7.1% responded only to DYN A. Responses to the mu selective agonist PL 017 were antagonized by the reversible opioid antagonist naloxone and the selective mu antagonist SMS 201-995 in a concentration-dependent fashion.

The present study was designed to explore the possibility that 5HT-induced contractions in the rat stomach fundus were mediated by interaction with receptors identical with either 5HT1A, 5HT1B or 5HT1C binding sites or 5HT3 receptors. Contractile concentration-response curves for several 5HT agonists [5-carboxamidotryptamine, TR3369, MK212, quipazine, RU 24969, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, TVXQ7821 and BEA 1654CL] were obtained in the rat stomach fundus. However, neither the potency nor maximum response of these agonists in contracting the rat stomach fundus correlated with the affinity of agonists at 5HT1A, 5Ht1B or 5HT1C binding sites. These agonists were interacting with 5HT receptors in the fundus based on the ability of 1-(1-naphthyl) piperazine (10(-7) M) to antagonize the contractile response of the relatively potent agonists. TVXQ7821 and BEA 1654Cl did not produce a marked contractile response in the fundus and also did not antagonize the contractile response to 5HT, suggesting that these agents have little, if any, affinity for the serotonergic receptor-mediating contraction in the fundus. The putative 5HT1A-selective receptor antagonists, WB4101 and spiroxatrine, did not block 5HT-induced contractions in the rat stomach fundus in concentrations consistent with their affinity at 5HT1A binding sites. The nonselective 5HT1A and 5HT1B receptor antagonist, cyanopindolol, also did not block 5HT-induced contractions in the rat stomach fundus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The contractile responses of three artery segments of diminishing diameter in the rabbit ear (i.e., unstretched lumen diameter approximately 300 mu in central ear artery, unstretched lumen diameter approximately 150 mu in main side branch off the central ear artery and unstretched lumen diameter approximately 75 mu in terminal branch off the main side branch) to high K+, norepinephrine (NE) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were tested before and after their incubation in Ca++-free physiologic salt solution for times varying from 3 to 60 min. The time course of reduction of the contractile responses to K+ with Ca++-free conditions in all classes of vessels could be represented by monoexponential curves that were not significantly different from each other. The contractile response of all the ear arteries to NE and 5-HT was biphasic. The first rapid transient phase (phase I) was more resistant to change upon the removal of exogenous Ca++ than the second usually equilibrium-like component (phase II), which was dramatically and rapidly reduced (but not necessarily eliminated) by this procedure. The extent of decline upon Ca++ removal in most instances was greater for 5-HT than for NE. The rate of falloff of both phases of contraction to NE and 5-HT was faster in the smaller compared with the larger arteries. These results suggest that, as vessels in the rabbit ear arterial tree get smaller, the contribution of a tightly bound or intracellular Ca++ pool to both phases of amine-induced contraction becomes smaller, but this contribution is greater to the transient compared with the equilibrium phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During exercise or dry air-induced asthma, airway walls cool. However, the role of temperature in the regulation of airway tone is not clear. Protein kinase C (PKC) is an important second messenger in the mediation of cell responses. To explore whether changes in temperature affect pathways involving PKC in airways, we examined the effects of phorbol esters, potent activators of PKC, in guinea pig tracheal rings at various temperatures. Phorbol-12,13-diacetate (PDA) caused a reduction in tracheal tone at 37 degrees C and an increase in tone when temperature was reduced to 22 degrees C. Increases in tone were also produced by PDA when cell membranes were depolarized by ouabain (10 microM) or KCl (30 mM) at 37 degrees C. Contractions produced by PDA at 22 degrees C were inhibited by lipoxygenase inhibitors [ETYA (5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid), NDGA (nordihydroguaiaretic acid) and phenidone] and a leukotriene receptor antagonist [FPL 55712 (sodium 7-[3-(4-acetyl-3-hydroxy-2-propylphenoxy)-2-hydroxypropoxyl] -4-oxo-8-propyl-4H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylate)]. Contractions produced by PDA at 37 degrees C or 22 degrees C in the presence of ouabain (10 mM) or KCl (30 mM) were not affected by these drugs. These results indicate that changes in temperature have profound effects on responses resulting from PKC activation. At low temperature, the lipoxygenase pathway mediates responses. Thus, cooling has the potential to modify a major intracellular pathway regulating physiological responses of the airways.\r"

No differences were found between the sensitized and tolerant groups in the levels of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain 12 min after i.p. administration of a challenge dose of cocaine, suggesting that in these chronic experiments the changes in the locomotor response are not accounted for by dispositional effects. In contrast, in animals treated daily for 2 or 3 days i.p. with cocaine and challenged with cocaine 1 day later, there was both a greater locomotor stimulation and a higher level of brain cocaine than in saline-pretreated animals, suggesting a dispositional effect.

In the rat, 19-NOR-P also shows marked salt-retaining and hypertensive effects, consistent with its high affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors (MR). We synthetized recently some p.o. active 19-NOR-P derivatives, and have examined the extent to which the structural changes made on the parent compound can modify the affinity for MR and the salt-retaining potency. Compared with aldosterone, 19-NOR-P has a 47% affinity for rat renal cytosolic MR, decreasing to 13% with alpha-hydroxylation on C-17 (17 alpha-OH-19-NOR-P). The addition of a methyl group combined with the formation of a double bond at C-6 led to nomegestrol, the relative affinity of which was 1.2%. Binding was almost abolished completely (0.23%) by acetylation of the 17 alpha-OH group (nomegestrol-acetate). A single s.c. injection of 19-NOR-P, 20 micrograms/animal, induced a marked decline of [Na+]/[K+] ratio in urine of adrenalectomized male rats. The antinatriuretic effect was still observed after a 11-day period of daily administrations of the same dosage. 17 alpha-OH-19-NOR-P decreased the [Na+]/[K+] ratio only at a high p.o. dose (2500 micrograms/animal). NOM-Ac did not affect the [Na+]/[K+] ratio after a single s.c. or p.o. administration, but increased it at the end of a 11-day p.o. treatment. Thus, the chemical modifications that lead to potent p.o. active progestins derived from 19-NOR-P induce stepwise reductions in the affinity for MR and of the mineralocorticoid effects of the parent compound.\r"

No definite pharmacological activity could be shown for quinidine-N-oxide up to concentrations of 16 mg/l. Quinidine and 3-hydroxyquinidine prevented ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia after coronary reperfusion in a concentration-dependent manner. The relationship between the drug concentration in the perfusate and the fractional suppression of arrhythmia could be described adequately for both compounds by the Hill equation. Whereas no difference was found for the Hill coefficient, the estimates of the concentration associated with 50% arrhythmia suppression was significantly higher for 3-hydroxyquinidine (10.7 +/- 0.3 mg/l vs. 2.2 +/- 0.25 mg/l), indicating that the relative potency of the metabolite was only about 20% compared to the parent compound. To investigate the pharmacodynamic interaction of the two compounds the concentration-response curve was determined for quinidine also in the presence of 3-hydroxyquinidine at a constant concentration of 4 mg/l. A method has been derived that allows quantitative assessment of the pharmacodynamic interaction of two compounds for which the concentration-effect relationship can be described by the Hill equation. The results indicate that the antiarrhythmic effects of 3-hydroxyquinidine and quinidine are additive.\r"

Competition experiments, using N6-cyclohexyladenosine and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine as the labeled ligands allowed the binding characteristics of the adenosine receptor(s) on myenteric nerve endings to be examined. The results showed that both N6-cyclohexyladenosine and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine were equieffective as displacers of labeled N6-cyclohexyladenosine binding. In contrast, the binding of labeled 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine revealed an inability of the A1 ligands N6-[R-1-methyl-2-phenethyl]adenosine and N6-cyclohexyladenosine to displace more than 50% of its specific binding. Competition curves generated using the potent and selective adenosine receptor antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-(4-sulfophenyl)xanthine revealed a clear difference between displacement profiles for N6-cyclohexyladenosine and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine. These data are indicative of the presence of more than one binding site on enteric nerve endings. Schild analysis of the antagonism of the presynaptic inhibitory effects of the nucleosides on the ileum using theophylline yielded linear isoboles with unit slopes indicating competitive antagonism. Similar analysis using 1,3-dipropyl-8-(4-sulfophenyl)xanthine yielded comparable results for the A1 agonists whereas 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine gave rise to a curvilinear isobole, a finding consistent with possible receptor heterogeneity. These findings show that data derived from both binding and functional studies support the existence of more than one adenosine receptor on myenteric nerves although they do not permit the subclassification of these sites as A1 or A2 receptor subtypes.\r"

The aim was to examine the roles of the N- and C-terminal sequences of substance P in stimulating histamine release from mast cells of the rat peritoneal cavity. SP1-4 C12 induces concentration-dependent histamine release in the range 8 to 200 nM. SP1-4C12 was 50 times more potent than substance P and 300 times more potent than dodecylamine. Unlike dodecylamine itself, SP1-4C12 induced noncytolytic histamine release which was inhibited by benzalkonium chloride and by the substance P antagonist [D-Pro4,D-Trp7,9,10]SP4-11. Histamine release induced by SP1-4C12 was inhibited at temperatures below 16 degrees C and did not require the presence of extracellular calcium ions. It is suggested that substance P and some other basic histamine liberators initiate histamine secretion by a mechanism that involves the insertion of a hydrophobic region into the membrane lipid which is necessary to present positively charged moieties to a receptor site involved in activating the secretory mechanism.\r"

Both carbachol and noradrenaline evoked an increase in [3H]IP accumulation at every age tested, although there were marked developmental differences in maximal responsiveness. Very large responses to carbachol were observed (greater than 20-fold) in the 1st week of development and these responses declined with time reaching adult levels at 21 days. During this time there was negligible change in the apparent affinity of carbachol and no effect on the relative intrinsic activity of a partial agonist arecoline. Maximal responses to noradrenaline at early ages (2, 7 and 14 days) were comparable with those observed in adult cortex but a significantly higher apparent affinity for noradrenaline and a higher relative intrinsic activity for phenylephrine were observed at these ages. Muscarinic and alpha-1 adrenoceptor binding sites increased progressively with age and reached adult levels by 21 to 40 days. Elevation of extracellular K+ to 18 mM resulted in an increased production of [3H]IPs at every age. The cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (50 microM) enhanced the response produced by elevated K+ at 14, 21 and 40 days but had no effect at 2 or 7 days. The Ca++ channel activator BAY-K-8644 (1 microM) enhanced the responses produced by elevated K+ at 7 and 40 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Its metabolism in isolated rat hepatocytes is presently studied. A major part of the substrate was conjugated with glutathione, but also amidase-catalyzed hydrolysis occurred, resulting in the products urea and alpha-bromoisovaleric acid (BI). The amidase activity was located in the microsomal fraction of the rat liver. The product of hydrolysis, BI, also was conjugated efficiently with glutathione. In glutathione-depleted hepatocytes, no glutathione conjugates but only urea and BI were formed. A pronounced stereoselectivity in the metabolism of the BIU enantiomers was observed: (R)-BIU was conjugated with glutathione much faster than (S)-BIU. (S)-BIU was hydrolyzed substantially in the cells and the glutathione conjugate of the hydrolytic product, (S)-BI, could be detected. At high BIU concentrations (500 microM of the racemate) intracellular glutathione was seriously depleted; then, the cosubstrate availability most likely was the rate-limiting factor in the conjugation of BIU with glutathione. More urea was formed from (racemic) BIU in isolated rat hepatocytes in the present study than in the perfused liver and the intact rat in previous studies. This in vivo-in vitro difference is tentatively assigned to differences in glutathione availability in these systems. The results suggest that BI may also be a useful model substrate to study the kinetics of glutathione conjugation in vivo and in vitro.\r"

We now realize there are three conditions which, when simultaneously present, will give a false reading of the events taking place. These are: metal salts, low pH with subsequent rise in pH during perfusion and use of blue dextran as the marker. When we perfused 10 mM AlCl3 or GaCl3 in vivo, all three conditions were provided, and led to the misinterpretation that all CSF production had been eliminated. In doing experiments that prevented the subsequent rise in pH during perfusion, or in using [14C]dextran as the marker in vivo, we found that Al and Ga (acting as Lewis acids at pH 4.7 and below), and also hydrochloric, phosphoric and acetic acids of the same pH, reduce CSF production by approximately 33%. We attribute this to the lowering of pH eliminating the uncatalyzed reaction OH- + CO2----HCO3- in secretory cells of choroid plexus. Acetazolamide blocks the HCO3- formation catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, and reduces CSF production 42%. These mechanisms are additive in that, when acetazolamide and either Al or acetic acid are given together, there is a total reduction of 64%. Therefore, at least 64% of CSF production is dependent on formation of HCO3-. The mechanisms accounting for the balance of CSF production are not yet defined clearly. A significant portion of this production is expected to relate to transport of Cl-.\r"

GABA contents were highest in the middle sections of the lung, as compared with proximal and distal areas. GABA evoked the release of [3H]ACh from the strips of the lung. The effect of GABA was mimicked by muscimol and antagonized by bicuculline and furosemide. Perfusion with Ca++-free medium and tetrodotoxin, but not nipecotic acid, inhibited the GABA- and muscimol-evoked release of [3H]ACh, thereby indicating that the released ACh was of neuronal origin. Diazepam and pentobarbital potentiated the muscimol-evoked [3H]ACh release. On the other hand, GABA reduced the KCl (40 mM)-evoked release of [3H]ACh in the presence of tetrodotoxin and bicuculline and baclofen mimicked the inhibitory effect of GABA. The effects of GABA and baclofen were not altered by alpha and beta adrenergic antagonists. These findings provide evidence for two types of GABA receptors in the lung of the guinea pig, and these receptors are involved in regulating the release of ACh.\r"

  ".W": "The relaxant action of amiloride was investigated in the smooth muscles of guinea pig taenia ceci and chicken gizzard. Amiloride inhibited the contractions induced by high K+ (45.4 mM) and carbachol (10 microM) in the taenia with the concentrations needed to induce 50% inhibition (IC50) of approximately 41 microM. A prolonged incubation period (greater than 1 hr) was necessary to obtain the full inhibition of these contractions. The taenia gradually accumulated amiloride and the tissue/medium ratio exceeded 2.0 after a 120-min incubation period. Amiloride had no effect on the high K+-stimulated 45Ca++ uptake or the ATP content of the taenia. Amiloride inhibited the Ca++-induced contraction of the saponin-treated taenia with an IC50 of 186 microM. Amiloride (10-1000 microM) also inhibited superprecipitation and Mg++-adenosine triphosphatase activity of the gizzard native actomyosin as well as the phosphorylation of myosin light chain. The inhibition of the phosphorylation was antagonized competitively by ATP. Amiloride (1 mM) had no effect on the dephosphorylation of myosin light chain upon removal of Ca++ from reaction medium. Amiloride, at concentrations up to 1 mM, had not effect on calmodulin activity as monitored by the Ca++-calmodulin-activated erythrocyte membrane (Ca++ + Mg++)-adenosine triphosphatase and phosphodiesterase activities. In contrast to this, trifluoperazine inhibited the calmodulin activity at the concentration needed to inhibit the Ca++-induced contraction of the permeabilized taenia and the superprecipitation and the phosphorylation of myosin light chain of gizzard. We conclude that amiloride, unlike trifluoperazine, may inhibit directly the myosin light chain kinase activity to induce muscle relaxation.\r"

Acute PY administration, 100 mg/kg i.p., prolonged hexobarbital sleep time in rats 2.5-fold. Chronic administration of PY to rabbits resulted in increased hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 content, with induction of different form(s) exhibiting elevated catalytic activities toward PY, N-nitrosodimethylamine, alcohols and aniline. PY administration (100 mg/kg i.p. for 5 days) to rabbits increased hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 content over 2-fold relative to uninduced animals. Sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of PY-induced microsomes revealed protein bands of enhanced intensity occurring in the regions of P-450 LM3 and LM4. Both PY- and imidazole-induced microsomes were effective in the production of PY N-oxide, with Vmax values of 1.6 and 1.8 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. When rates were normalized for P-450 content, PY- and imidazole-induced microsomes produced 0.9 nmol of PY N-oxide/min/nmol of P-450, comparable to that obtained for PB-induced suspensions. N-nitrosodimethylamine N-demethylase activity was enhanced 2.5- and 6-fold relative to PB- and beta-naphthoflavone-induced microsomes, respectively. A single low KM value of 0.17 mM was obtained for N-nitrosodimethylamine N-demethylase activity in PY-induced microsomes; in contrast PB- and beta-naphthoflavone-induced microsomes yielded biphasic kinetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using extracellular single-barreled microelectrodes, DA neurons were identified by their long duration, positive-negative action potentials and their slow bursting pattern of spontaneous firing, as well as by the location of recording sites through histological recoveries of dye deposits. Like haloperidol and clozapine, which are full DA receptor antagonists, TDHL antagonized the depression in DA neuron firing induced by systemic amphetamine. However, where full antagonists completely reversed the amphetamine effect, TDHL could do so only partially, the maximal effect being around half. Like DA agonists, but unlike DA antagonists, TDHL also depressed the spontaneous firing rates of DA neurons. But whereas the full agonist apomorphine completely inhibited firing of DA neurons, TDHL only depressed firing rates by about half, even at high doses. These data support the contention that TDHL is a partial DA agonist.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular recordings were made from locus ceruleus (LC) neurons in slices of rat pons. It has been shown previously that opioids inhibit firing and hyperpolarize LC neurons by activating mu-opioid receptors. Concentration-response curves were constructed by measuring the hyperpolarization, or outward current at -60 mV, caused by various opioid agonists added to the superfusing solution. Peptidase inhibitors (kelatorphan, bestatin and thiorphan) each increased the potency of Met-enkephalin, Leu-enkephalin and metorphamide but had no effect of their own on the LC neurons. Kelatorphan (20 microM) produced a 7-fold shift to the left of the Met-enkephalin dose-response curve. Higher concentrations produced no further shift. Thiorphan (3 microM) and bestatin (20 microM) each had a smaller potentiating effect on the Met-enkephalin hyperpolarization. The effects of Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol and noradrenaline were not potentiated by these peptidase inhibitors. Electrical stimulation produced an inhibitory synaptic potential that was prolonged by cocaine (10 microM) and blocked by the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (1 microM). After addition of idazoxan, hyperpolarizing synaptic potentials could be evoked even in the presence of kelatorphan (20 microM). These results indicate that peptide metabolism in the intact brain slice can account for a substantial decrease in the sensitivity of LC neurons to exogenously applied opioid peptides; even after peptidase inhibition, no evidence could be obtained for hyperpolarizing synaptic potentials due to the release of endogenous opioids.\r"

  ".W": "Fezolamine [N,N-dimethyl-3,4-diphenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-propanamine-(E)-2- butenedioate] is a new, nontricyclic agent under investigation as a potential antidepressant. In vitro, it was 3 to 4 times more selective in blocking synaptosomal uptake of [3H]norepinephrine than uptake of [3H]serotonin or [3H]dopamine. In classical behavioral tests using monoamine-depleted animals, it prevented the depressant effects of reserpine and tetrabenzine. In addition, it was active in the \"behavioral despair\" procedure. Its potency in three of these models was similar to that of standard tricyclics (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline) or newer nontricyclic antidepressants (e.g., bupropion). In the mouse mydriasis and oxotremorine antagonism models, anticholinergic properties of fezolamine were weak or absent compared with imipramine and amitriptyline. Locomotor activity in mice was not increased by fezolamine at doses 2 to 16 times greater than effective antidepressant doses, suggesting the absence of central nervous system stimulant properties. Fezolamine did not inhibit monoamine oxidase activity in ex vivo studies and, unlike pargyline, did not produce locomotor hyperactivity in mice pretreated with L-tryptophan. In vitro studies using canine Purkinje tissue suggest that fezolamine has significantly less ability to depress myocardial conduction parameters than similar concentrations of imipramine. In a myocardially infarcted cat model, plasma levels of fezolamine 19 to 28 times greater than those achieved with imipramine were required before inducing significant depression of cardiac function and mean arterial pressure. Fezolamine, unlike imipramine, did not increase sinus rate. Fezolamine may thus show antidepressant efficacy in man with minimal anticholinergic or cardiovascular side effects common to tricyclic antidepressants.\r"

Using whole cell patch clamp, [3H]PN200-110 binding and 45Ca++ uptake studies, we examined the effects of this compound on voltage-dependent Ca++ channels in rat anterior pituitary cells. At a concentration of 10(-5) M, MDL 12,330A showed little effect on outward K+ current, Na+ current or low-threshold Ca++ current in this cell line. At 10(-6) M, MDL 12,330A reversibly inhibited slow Ca++ current in a voltage-dependent manner. 45Ca++ uptake was also blocked by this compound at 10(-6) M, whereas [3H]PN200-110 binding was stimulated at concentrations of 10(-7) to 10(-6) M. The results are consistent with an interaction of MDL 12,330A with slow Ca++ channels at a site allosterically linked to the 1,4-dihydropyridine binding site.\r"

The striatum had a much higher density of [3H]cocaine binding sites than either the frontal or occipital cortices. Also, the ratio of high/low affinity sites was highest for striatum, lower for cortices and lowest for whole brain. Scatchard analysis of cocaine binding to striatum and cortex suggested that, in addition to the high affinity binding (Kd = 16 nM), there were two or more lower affinity sites.

RNS (1-4 Hz), Vt (15-90 nmol) and KCl (150-500 mumol) produced renal vasoconstriction and enhanced the tritium overflow in a frequency- and concentration-dependent manner, respectively. Omission of Ca++ (1.8 mM) from the perfusion fluid abolished the renal vasoconstriction and the increase in tritium overflow elicited by RNA and KCl and substantially reduced that caused by Vt. Lowering the Na+ concentration in the perfusion medium (from 150 to 25 mM) reduced the overflow of tritium and the renal vasoconstriction caused by RNS (2 Hz) or Vt (45 nmol); the increase in tritium overflow in response to these stimuli was positively correlated with extracellular Na+ (25-150 mM). In contrast, KCl-induced tritium overflow was negatively correlated with extracellular Na+ concentration. Tetrodotoxin (0.3 microM) abolished the effect of RNS and Vt, but not that of KCl, to increase overflow of tritium and to produce renal vasoconstriction. Administration of amiloride (180 microM) enhanced the overflow of tritium but attenuated the associated renal vasoconstriction produced by RNS, Vt and KCl. Replacement of NaCl (75 mM) with equimolar concentration of LiCl enhanced the overflow of tritium elicited by RNS, Vt and KCl; the associated renal vasoconstriction remained unaltered. Administration of Ca++ channel blocker, flunarizine (2 microM), but not diltiazem (6 microM) or nifedipine (1.4 microM), inhibited RNS-, Vt- and KCl-induced overflow of tritium; nifedipine enhanced whereas diltiazem failed to alter tritium overflow elicited by these stimuli. The renal vasoconstriction produced by RNS, Vt and KCl was inhibited by diltiazem and nifedipine, as well as by flunarizine. These data suggest that RNS, Vt and KCl enhance release of the adrenergic transmitter by promoting influx of Ca++ into the nerve terminal, not by Na+-Ca++ exchange transport process, but rather through specific Ca++ channels that are distinct from those located in the vascular smooth muscle.\r"

GABA and related substances, baclofen and muscimol, had no effect on the resting tension but reversibly depressed contractions induced by electrical field stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion, IC50 values (mean +/- S.E.) being 5.6 +/- 1.4 X 10(-6) M, 6.8 +/- 0.9 X 10(-6) M and 8.5 +/- 1.5 X 10(-5) M, respectively. In contrast, GABA did not alter the response to exogenous acetylcholine or the nonadrenergic noncholinergic inhibitory component. Pretreatment of tissues with bicuculline antagonized the inhibitory effect of GABA as well as that of baclofen. This inhibitory effect was not modified by propranolol, phentolamine, hemicholinium-3 or naloxone, but it was blocked by the Cl channel blocker furosemide and by the substitution of external Cl. These results suggest that GABA decreases the contractile response of airway smooth muscle to cholinergic nerve stimulation by inhibiting the evoked release of acetylcholine and that this effect is exerted by activating Cl-dependent, bicuculline-sensitive GABA receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Mice were treated with increasing doses of beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA) ranging from 0.15 to 9.6 nmol i.c.v. in an attempt to substantially reduce the population of mu opioid receptors. Two hours later, the analgesic effect of morphine was assessed by the acetic acid writhing assay. ED50 of morphine [0.97 (0.58-1.60) nmol] was increased 2- and 8.5-fold at the lowest and highest dose of beta-FNA, respectively. When the highest dose was injected twice 24 hr apart and the mice were tested 24 hr after the second dose, the ED50 of morphine had increased 30.5-fold when compared with the control value. The latter beta-FNA-treated mice exhibited an apparent pA2 value of 6.19 (6.10-6.28) for morphine-naloxone compared with the control value of 7.39 (7.05-7.73), suggesting that morphine was interacting with receptors other than mu. Selective kappa (binaltorphimine) and delta (ICI 154129 and ICI 174864) antagonists were used to see whether these other receptors might be involved in mediating morphine analgesia in beta-FNA-treated animals. Because both the kappa and delta antagonists inhibited significantly the analgesic effect of morphine in beta-FNA-treated mice at doses that had no effect on morphine analgesia in control mice, these data suggest that morphine interacts with both kappa and delta receptors to produce analgesia when the population of functional mu receptors is drastically reduced by alkylation with beta-FNA.\r"

Normally an actively proliferative and invasive tissue, healthy trophoblast shares cytologic features with malignant neoplasms. When trophoblastic hyperplasia accompanies macroscopic villous swelling, a diagnosis of hydatidiform mole (HM) is in order. Exuberant and atypical avillous trophoblast characterizes choriocarcinoma (CCA) and placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). The distinction between them rests on the dimorphic composition of CCA as contrasted with the relative monomorphism of PSTT. Immunohistochemical studies contribute to the latter differential diagnosis. Unfortunately, two common conditions share morphologic features with the major lesions of gestational trophoblast. The hydropic abortus may resemble HM; the banal implantation site in normal early pregnancy and later spontaneous abortion may suggest either CCA or PSTT. Familiarity with the normal and benign variants of chorionic epithelium and thorough tissue sampling may be helpful in difficult cases. Ambiguous lesions that do not conform to conventional classification should be referred for consultation. A few, however, will not fit neatly into diagnostic categories. In such instances, a descriptive report and clear communication with the patient's physician provide the best current approach to clinical follow-up.\r"

The Goldie-Coldman hypothesis, one such model, holds that resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs can be acquired in human tumors as a result of spontaneous mutation. This paper examines in depth some implications of this hypothesis in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Several observed treatment phenomena in this disease are in accord with the predictions of the somatic mutation model, and the model may be used to guide future clinical investigation. In particular, there is a need to elaborate cross-resistance profiles between drugs commonly used to treat trophoblastic neoplasia. This information could be used to develop new combination chemotherapy regimens as well as strategies for alternating non-cross-resistant combination chemotherapy regimens.\r"

The time from the pregnancy event to treatment and the pretreatment human chorionic gonadotropin level were both significantly greater in the 53 patients who died as compared to the 486 who were cured. Seventy percent of fatal cases developed in association with term or preterm pregnancies, abortions or ectopic pregnancies rather than hydatidiform moles. Fifty-one percent of patients who died had brain, liver and/or peritoneal metastases at diagnosis. Ninety-six percent of patients had a Bagshawe score of greater than or equal to 8 (high-risk group): the average score was 13. The most common causes of death were hemorrhage from one or more metastatic sites (42%) and pulmonary insufficiency (31%). Factors primarily responsible for the treatment failures in these patients were: (1) presence of extensive choriocarcinoma at the time of diagnosis, (2) lack of appropriately aggressive initial treatment in high-risk patients, and (3) failure of presently used treatment protocols to control advanced disease. Secondary chemotherapy and radiotherapy to sites other than the brain failed to improve survival. Adjuvant surgical procedures, especially hysterectomy and thoracotomy, may be useful for excising localized, chemotherapy-resistant tumors.\r"

A retrospective analysis was performed comparing cervical isolation rates, endometrial maturation patterns and laparoscopic findings in 64 patients with SFE and in a control group of 70 unselected patients with no histologic evidence of SFE at endometrial biopsy. The data suggest that although the prevalence of pelvic damage of various types is high, SFE cannot be used as a reliable marker for pelvic adhesions or endometriosis; that SFE does not interfere with normal endometrial maturation; and that SFE is not invariably associated with cervical U urealyticum but may represent resolving infection. It is also possible that SFE represents endometrial autoimmunity either following mycoplasma infection or arising spontaneously.\r"

In order to detect endometrial surface ultrastructural asynchrony that might reduce prospects for successful embryo transfer, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on biopsies obtained from these five women and compared them against those from four normal, spontaneously ovulating controls. Light microscopy revealed all nine women to be in the late luteal phase (day 26 +/- 2) and with glandular-stromal synchrony. Further concordance was seen with SEM, with no discernible difference in the development of cilia, microcilia or apical secretory protrusions between the two groups. SEM, a technique that permits visual assessment of endometrial surface topography, demonstrated that this regimen of native E2 and P4 restored the surface ultrastructure of the prematurely menopausal human endometrium to correspond to that in the normal menstrual cycle.\r"

Prior hysterectomy had no effect on surgical outcome. Functional length in the sitting position was augmented by 4.3 mm (P less than .01) after the modified Burch procedure. However, there was no significant change in closure pressure. Patients who failed incontinence surgery had significantly lower preoperative closure pressures (P less than .005) and functional lengths (P less than .025). Urethral pressure profiles may be used to identify those patients with low-pressure, short urethras; they are at increased risk of surgical failure.\r"

We analyzed and compared the protein profiles produced by these cells, using patient matched peripheral blood and SF PMN as well as peripheral blood PMN from normals. Twenty-five patients with either rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or gout were studied. Fluorographs of SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels, performed using cell supernatants from metabolically labelled cells, revealed an increased release of de novo synthesized proteins by inflammatory SF PMN compared to peripheral blood PMN. Under reducing conditions, 4 clearly distinguishable high molecular mass products were observed (Mr 230,000, 185,000, 170,000 and 95,000). Two of the protein bands were found to be gelatin binding (Mr 230,000 and Mr 95,000). By Western blot, the Mr 230,000 protein was found to be fibronectin and the Mr 95,000 protein was shown to be identical to a recently described gelatinase. Thus, the activation of PMN in inflammation is accompanied by an increased release of a number of de novo synthesized proteins, including fibronectin. Our studies directly pertain to the in vivo inflammatory process since the PMN were not activated artificially in vitro.\r"

Adherent monocytes from 33 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and rheumatoid vasculitis, 32 patients with inactive RA alone, and 20 healthy controls were incubated with 125I-aggregated IgG (125I-AIgG) of restricted size with or without fresh serum. Normal monocytes degraded 9.8% of 125I-AIgG via FcR alone and the presence of complement enhanced degradation to 2.7%. Degradation of 125I-AIgG via FcR from patients without active RA suggested a depressed function of FcR. The maximal amount of 125I-AIgG which was bound by monocytes from patients with inactive and active RA, however, was increased compared to normals, suggesting a defect in intracellular processing in patients with RA. The degradation of 125I-AIgG in the presence of complement was also significantly depressed for both groups of patients. The monocytes from the patients also had decreased numbers of C3b receptors (CR1). Since CR1 are involved in the enhanced uptake of immune complexes bearing complement, the depressed capacity of monocytes from patients with RA to degrade 125I-AIgG in vitro may be caused both by a diminished uptake as well as a diminished capacity to degrade soluble AIgG.\r"

Nineteen of the 25 patients (76%) with ulcers and/or erosions had type O blood. Patients with abnormal and normal endoscopies had similar frequencies of GI complaints and fecal blood loss. GI symptoms and occult fecal blood loss, therefore, are not prominent features of upper GI disease in RA.

The reliability of the pain behavior frequencies of patients with RA across 2 observation sessions also was determined. Total pain behavior scores clearly differentiated patients with RA and low back pain from depressed and nondepressed, pain free, control subjects. Pain behavior observed in patients with RA showed a high degree of stability over time. The results of our study suggest that the behavioral observation method will prove useful in the assessment of RA pain in clinical and research settings.\r"

Average followup was 1.7 years in Phoenix, 3.4 years in Wichita, and 12 years in Saskatoon. Twenty-four potentially predictive variables were analyzed by stepwise linear regression. Common predictors were age, sex, and duration of illness, suggesting that these variables are important predictors of disease regardless of the population being studied. In addition, the initial level of disability and radiographic variables are good predictors of disability. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and latex titers also were associated with future functional disability but do not have a linear relationship and predict less well.\r"

The prevalence of inducing a Raynaud's attack decreased with each successive cold challenge from 74% of patients at initial challenge to 42% at the 3rd challenge. A lower temperature was required to induce a Raynaud's attack at last challenge (10.6 +/- 0.6 degrees C) compared to the first cold challenge (13.2 +/- 1.0 degrees C).

Thus, small amounts of RF are produced at certain times in many patients with Lyme disease, and IgM-RF production appears to be linked to the specific IgM response.\r"

Twelve of 15 patients with psoriatic skin lesions and arthritis completed a 16-week placebo controlled double blind crossover study. A significant improvement was noted in grip strength, Ritchie's index, joint size, joint pain and overall therapeutic assessment. Psoriatic skin lesions were not improved by colchicine. The few side effects observed were related to gastrointestinal intolerance, which were usually controlled by temporarily reducing the dose of the drug. Our results indicate that 1.5 mg colchicine daily is an effective treatment for psoriatic arthritis.\r"

Fifty-eight patients (72%) had joint symptoms; nonspecific arthralgia was the most frequent. Fifteen patients had morning stiffness and interrupted sleep due to arthralgias (shoulders 9, fingers 3) and 10 patients had diminished finger mobility. Radiographic evaluation showed 7 classes of lesions which are not characteristic of renal osteodystrophy or degenerative lesions, including erosive arthropathies of the fingers (8%), multiple carpal bone cysts (10%), cysts of the humeral head (9%), cysts of the hip (11%), erosive spondyloarthropathies (9%), cervical spondylolisthesis (5%) and multiple diaphyseal lacunae (1%). Overall, 42 distinct radiological lesions were observed in a total population of 23 patients. Twenty-nine of these lesions occurred in patients undergoing dialysis for at least 10 years. Certain clinical and radiological patterns were frequently combined after dialysis for more than 10 years: carpal tunnel syndrome, inflammatory joint pain, bone cysts and spondyloarthropathies.\r"

While conventional radiography and computed tomography have proven useful in the demonstration of abnormalities affecting the spinous processes, they are of limited utility in the evaluation of the intervening soft tissues, which are the predominant site of initial pathologic involvement. To explore the potential role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the assessment of the spinous processes and adjacent ligaments, a retrospective review of 55 consecutive examinations of the lumbar spine was performed. The normal and pathologic appearances of the region on both T1 and T2 weighted images were characterized, and the optimal imaging variables for demonstration of the spinous processes and adjacent soft tissues were determined with subsequent prospective application to new cases. Correlative examination of cadaveric sections and dried specimens was also performed to facilitate understanding of anatomical relationships visualized by MRI. Based upon the results of this investigation, MRI is the procedure of choice in the evaluation of disease processes affecting the spinous processes and intervening ligaments, primarily owing to the ability to image directly in the sagittal plane and its superior soft tissue contrast discrimination capability.\r"

Proteins with molecular weights from 12 to 440 kDa and isoelectric points (pI) from 4.5 to 10 were tested for the ability to penetrate and persist in cartilage. Native proteins were modified for a range of pI. Using radiolabeled proteins we showed that retention of proteins in cartilage is a function of their pI. At pI 8.5-9 all proteins showed a sharp increase in cartilage when incubated at physiologic pH. The molecular weight of a protein and its charge is a determining factor for penetration of cartilage. By autoradiography highly cationic proteins up to 150 kDa (IgG) readily penetrated cartilage. Immunofluorescence confirmed these findings. Cationic catalase (240 kDa) showed superficial penetration, but penetration of cationic ferritin (440 kDa) was not demonstrated, suggesting that 240 to 440 kDa represents the upper range for penetration. Small anionic proteins (cytochrome-c; pI less than 4.5; 12 kDa) penetrate in small quantities but do not persist, whereas larger anionic proteins (IgG; pI less than 4.5; 150 kDa) cannot penetrate at all. Our data help define the properties of proteins that are able to interact with cartilage matrix and chondrocytes.\r"

This report describes our experience and policy change during this transitional period. Emergency laparotomies performed in the pediatric age group (less than 14 yr) between 1980 and 1984, based on peritoneal lavage, were reviewed. Of 16 such patients, six (37.5%) had injuries identified at laparotomy necessitating operation, (four greater than Grade III spleen, one hepatic vein, one small bowel). The remaining ten patients (67.5%) had injuries which probably could have been managed nonoperatively (eight less than or equal to Grade II spleen, two less than or equal to Grade II liver). We additionally reviewed 46 peritoneal lavages done in children during 1984, and noted a 100% sensitivity but 86% specificity when considering essential laparotomies. Based on these data, we established a selective management protocol and initiated a prospective study in January 1985. The protocol consisted of: 1) routine peritoneal lavage (DPL) in children at high risk for abdominal injury, 2) immediate laparotomy for DPL positive for blood in conjunction with hemodynamic instability, 3) selective laparotomy for DPL positive for blood in a stable child, additionally evaluated by abdominal CT scan (major mechanism) or liver/spleen scan (minor mechanism), and 4) mandatory laparotomy for DPL effluent positive by criteria other than blood. This policy reduced unnecessary laparotomy, otherwise warranted by DPL, to 18% (2/11); both patients had Grade II splenic injuries. Five children sustaining low-energy trauma were managed nonoperatively following peritoneal aspiration of gross blood with L-S scan confirming minor solid visceral injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These are demonstrated to include: the presence of underlying medical illness, duration of cold exposure, initial core temperature, mental status, the presence of spontaneous respirations, presenting cardiac rate and rhythm, and arterial oxygen tension. Profound hyperkalemia and markedly elevated serum ammonia levels indicate cell lysis; significant hypofibrinogenemia suggests intravascular thrombosis and each laboratory marker predicts a dire outcome. The treatment of choice for severe accidental hypothermia is felt to be rapid core rewarming on cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

  ".W": "During a 2-year period, 248 consecutive patients were admitted with multiple trauma. Acute gastric dilatation was documented in 67 (27%) patients by review of all admission roentgenograms. There were 51 (76%) males and 16 females. Ages ranged from 2 to 80 years (mean, 29.2 years). The incidence of acute gastric dilatation in children was 44% vs. 25% for adults (p less than 0.05). The mechanism of injury was motor vehicle accident in 45 (67%), agricultural accident in 8 (12%), fall in four (6%), bicycle accident in four (6%), and miscellaneous in six (9%). There were 38 orthopedic, 35 craniocerebral, 34 abdominal, 31 thoracic, 27 maxillofacial, and 14 spinal injuries. Injury Severity Scores ranged from 4 to 66 (mean, 23.5). Thirteen (19%) patients presented in shock and there were four (6%) hospital deaths. No death was attributable to gastric dilatation. Nasogastric tubes were placed in 41 (61%) patients and 26 were managed without tube placement. Complications associated with acute gastric dilatation included pulmonary aspiration in three (4%) patients, gastric hemorrhage in three (4%), gastrointestinal perforation in one (1%), and prolonged ileus in 12 (18%). In addition, gastric dilatation rendered abdominal examination difficult and delayed peritoneal lavage. Acute gastric dilatation after trauma is frequent in our rural trauma center. Early placement of a nasogastric tube in the absence of a clear contraindication is strongly supported in the management of multiply injured patients.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to more clearly delineate the importance and pathophysiology of moderate-severe hemoptysis, a clinical and experimental study was performed. The clinical portion consisted of a retrospective review of 344 patients undergoing thoracotomy for penetrating trauma. There were 138 patients with injuries to the trachea, mainstem bronchi or lungs. Six with GSW to the chest had severe hemoptysis in the Emergency Department (ED) and had a cardiac arrest just after endotracheal intubation. At thoracotomy, all six had air in their coronary arteries and could not be resuscitated, Of 14 patients with posterolateral OR thoracotomies, three had significant (20-30 mm Hg) drops in systolic pressure plus increased aspiration of blood into the dependent lung when turned onto their sides. Of 12 patients surviving surgery, six with continued aspiration of blood required prolonged ventilatory support. In an experimental study, minimally heparinized (0.07 units/ml) blood was infused into the lower trachea of 17 anesthetized normovolemic supine dogs at 0.15 ml/kg/min. The PaO2 fell from 100 +/- 11 to 65 +/- 16 mm Hg after infusion of 4.5 ml/kg of blood. At the same time peak ventilator pressure rose only minimally (8.5 +/- 1.7 to 11.2 +/- 3.1 mm Hg). The PCO2, mean PA pressure, PAWP, CVP, and cardiac output were essentially unchanged. In a second study of 18 dogs, reducing the systolic BP by one third reduced cardiac output by almost 48% and oxygen transport by 58%. After 4.5 ml/kg blood were infused into the trachea, the PaO2 fell from 84 +/- 19 to 52 +/- 9 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bilateral hypogastric artery ligation has failed in this scenario due to extensive collateralization of the pelvic circulation. We present our experience with intraoperative hypogastric artery embolization used in the management of four patients, and review the available literature on the subject.\r"

  ".W": "There is increasing evidence that stress hormones and neurotransmitters may represent an information channel between the immune, endocrine, and central nervous systems. The goal of this investigation was to determine the in vitro effect of selected stress hormones on neutrophil and lymphocyte function using leukocytes from healthy volunteers. The following hormones were tested using a complete dose response curve including dosages within the physiological range; cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and glucagon. Cortisol did not affect neutrophil function, but did suppress lymphocyte blastogenesis. The catecholamines, epinephrine, and norepinephrine inhibited only neutrophil chemotaxis, while glucagon impaired both neutrophil chemotactic and bactericidal activity. When the individual hormones were combined into hormone cocktails, the inhibitory effect of both epinephrine and glucagon on neutrophil function was lost, while the inhibitory effect of cortisol on lymphocyte blastogenesis was greatly reduced. In fact, incubation of neutrophils in the stress hormone cocktail resulted in the neutrophils becoming hypermetabolic. Although the in vitro effects of these hormones on neutrophil and lymphocyte function do not fully correlate with the in vivo effect of trauma on immune function, these studies do support the general concept that the stress hormones may represent a link between the immune and endocrine systems.\r"

Massive excision of burns with autograft and homograft coverage has radically changed the course of disease. Three hundred ninety-three patients were admitted to the Shriners Burns Institute, of whom 125 patients had fungus cultured during their hospitalization and 42 patients subsequently developed involvement of three or more organs. Twenty-one of the 42 patients developed Candida septicemia requiring amphotericin B or flucytosine therapy. The mean third-degree burn in patients with Candida septicemia was 65% total body surface area compared to three-organ involvement/no clinical sepsis at 38% mean third-degree burn. Patients developing candidemia did so during the first week postburn and 7 days after excision therapy. It is hypothesized that massive burns with immunosuppression are further suppressed by repeated surgical intervention, anesthesia, and perioperative use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further predisposing these patients to early development of Candida septicemia. With early recognition of burn wound invasion by routine biopsies, wound swabs, and early amphotericin therapy, the mortality has been reduced to 14% compared to 60-90% reported in other series.\r"

These devices are capable of delivering contaminants such as paint, solvents, and grease at pressures ranging from 600-12,000 psi. This allows the substance to penetrate through a minute skin wound and to spread widely through fascial planes and tendon sheaths and to produce significant vascular compression and systemic toxicity. High pressure injection injuries frequently result in amputation. Fifty-five suspected high pressure injection injury cases were evaluated. Twenty were determined to be actual injection injuries from equipment producing pressures in the range of 1,500-12,000 psi. The injected contaminants included latex paint, mineral spirits, and concrete sealer. Fourteen injuries involved digits. Digital amputation was necessary in three patients. Hospital admissions averaged 6.5 days. Successful management of these cases involves awareness of the impending problem and rapid referral of the patient to an emergency department and to a competent orthopedic or plastic surgeon.\r"

  ".W": "Prompt hemodialysis or hemoperfusion can be of value during the first 24 hours after paraquat ingestion particularly when the patient has developed acute renal failure. However, many cases of paraquat poisoning occur in areas where hemoperfusion facilities are unavailable. In contrast, continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH) could be instituted easily. We have measured the removal of paraquat from the body by CAVH in a 46 year old male cane farmer who ingested 70 ml, 20% paraquat and died twelve days later from pulmonary fibrosis. Renal failure developed rapidly. Concentrations of paraquat were measured by an indirect competitive ELISA using a murine paraquat monoclonal IgG antibody. Hemoperfusion was performed daily for five days, beginning 78 hours post-ingestion. By 180 hours, when the patient was in respiratory failure, hemoperfusion was replaced with CAVH which was continued for 46 hours. During this time interval, 1.1 mg paraquat was recovered in the hemofiltrate and 1.56 mg paraquat in the urine. The extraction of paraquat by the hemofilter was close to 100%. The plasma clearance of paraquat across the hemofilter was 6.1 ml/min and the renal clearance was 8.2 ml/min. The mean hemoperfusion clearance of paraquat was 50 ml/min and the total amount of paraquat removed by the 34 hours of hemoperfusion was 9 mg. Because of the relative ease with which CAVH can be performed, its low cost, compared to that of hemoperfusion or hemodialysis, and the continuous nature of the procedure, CAVH may be worth considering in paraquat poisoning. It could be used particularly in those patients who have developed renal failure or while patients are being prepared for hemoperfusion.\r"

Three cases were treated with charcoal hemoperfusion with mean hemoperfusion clearance ranging from 134-164 ml/min compared to 174 ml/min in one case treated with resin filter and the same blood flow of 200 ml/min. In two cases, a mean renal meprobamate clearance of 15 and 23 ml/min was calculated comprising only 9-15% of the hemoperfusion clearance. The amount of meprobamate removed by hemoperfusion ranged from 1.6-6.2 g. In one case, the half-life of plasma meprobamate during hemoperfusion was 2.6 hours compared to 8.3 hours after hemoperfusion. Thus the half-life was reduced more than 3-fold. These data show that hemoperfusion may be indicated in severe meprobamate intoxication.\r"

The findings of the laboratory analysis of these patients are presented in this paper. The toxicology laboratory of this hospital performs screening procedures for various drugs on urine specimens by thin layer chromatography. Drugs detected are confirmed by gas chromatography and a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique. In 1981, 1.6% of the urine specimens of patients in the above-mentioned category were found to be positive for PCP. This percentage increased sharply during 1982 (5.8%) and 1983 (5.6%). During 1984 and 1985 the percentage dropped to 4.2% and 4.6%. It is implied from data that the abuse of this drug in this area has leveled off. The data also indicated that PCP is predominantly used by young adults with ages ranging from 21 to 30 years. The abuse of this drug in people over 40 years of age is comparatively very small. Among users of this drug, 67.5% are men and 32.5% are women. Out of 68 women found to be abusing PCP, 5 delivered their babies in this hospital. PCP was detected in the urine specimens of each of these babies. Four out of the five infants showed withdrawal symptoms such as extreme irritability, jitteriness, hyperactivity with high pitched cries and a poor ability to take food.\r"

Subsequently, the patient developed hepatic necrosis, coma and hemostatic dysfunction and expired in cardiac failure after two weeks. The fatal outcome supports the view that the potential lethal dose of iron is lower for adults than for children. This case also demonstrates that major hepatic dysfunction can be a prominent feature of adult cases of iron intoxication. It is not unequivocal that early institution of deferoxamine treatment would have had a significant influence on the outcome. However, taking into account the well-documented efficacy of the drug in children and that no major adverse fetal effects have been associated with deferoxamine treatment in pregnancy, we suggest such antidote therapy to be considered for prompt institution in similar cases.\r"

High grade upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma and a history of metachronous or synchronous bladder transitional cell carcinoma were independent adverse prognostic factors. However, patients with low grade upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma and no evidence of a urothelial field change had a 100 per cent 5-year survival rate.

Most of these patients had low grade (12), noninvasive (10) tumors involving a solitary functioning kidney (12). The operations performed were open pyelotomy with tumor excision and fulguration (8 patients), partial nephrectomy (5) and percutaneous nephroscopic fulguration (1). There was 1 operative death. Of the 13 surviving patients 8 (62 per cent) remained free of transitional cell carcinoma postoperatively, while 5 (38 per cent) had recurrent disease. Six patients (46 per cent) presently are free of tumor 6 months to 5 years postoperatively. Conservative surgical techniques can provide satisfactory treatment for selected patients with renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma when preservation of functioning renal parenchyma is necessary to avoid kidney failure.\r"

  ".W": "Between May 1979 and July 1983, 217 consecutive patients with documented primary bladder tumors invading muscle were evaluated to determine the fate of patients with conservatively treated muscle-infiltrating bladder cancer. The disease was re-staged by urine cytology, bimanual examination with the patient under anesthesia and transurethral biopsy or resection. Of the 217 patients 172 underwent total or partial cystectomy and 45 (21 per cent, 37 with stage T2, 7 with stage T3a and 1 with stage T4 disease) did not because re-staging showed no residual tumor (stage T0) in 20, carcinoma in situ in 17, stage T1 tumor in 4 and local stage T2 cancer in 4. The median followup was 5.1 years (range 3 to 7 years). Of the 45 patients 30 (65 per cent) are free of tumor or have required transurethral resection and intravesical therapy for recurrent tumors but cystectomy has not been necessary. Of the 15 failures 11 underwent cystectomy 9 to 30 months after re-staging (7 are alive and 4 died of disease) and 4 are alive with metastatic disease (2 with negative bladder biopsies). Re-staging in the 4 patients who died showed stage T0 disease in 2, carcinoma in situ in 1 and stage T2 tumor in 1. The over-all survival rate was 82 per cent (37 of 45) and it was 67 per cent (30 of 45) for patients with a functioning bladder. The data suggest that endoscopic re-staging may identify a subset of patients with limited muscle-infiltrating bladder tumors that can be managed conservatively without immediate cystectomy.\r"

However, the appreciation of its effect must rely on the evaluation of penile rigidity. Since measurement of rigidity requires a sophisticated procedure that may not be available to the majority of practitioners, we attempted to find a simple and objective method to evaluate the results of this common test. We tested 50 patients complaining of impotence with intracavernous injection of 60 mg. papaverine. The length and circumference of the penis were measured before and after papaverine injection. The rigidity was determined by measuring the angle between the penis and the legs with the patient in the standing position. Afterwards, each patient underwent vascular (Doppler ultrasound and cavernometry) and neurological examinations. A total of 27 patients with no vascular abnormalities had an erectile angle of 96 degrees (range 90 to 130 degrees), while 23 patients had some vascular disorders (9 arterial lesions, 8 venous leakage and 6 combined lesions) and an erectile angle of 36 degrees (range 0 to 60 degrees). There was no significant difference between the groups in the increase of length and circumference of the penis after intracavernous injection of papaverine. The papaverine test can distinguish between patients with vascular and psychogenic problems. A negative papaverine test associated with a normal Doppler examination is characteristic of venous leakage. Measurement of the erectile angle after intracavernous injection of papaverine with the patient in the standing position is a simple, objective and reliable method to evaluate patients with vascular impotence.\r"

Although prostatic specific antigen values were elevated in 21 per cent of the patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy, the elevations usually were low and did not interfere with clinical interpretation. Prostatic specific antigen was elevated in 98 per cent of 86 men with active stage D2 disease; in 22 per cent of the men prostatic specific antigen was the only elevated marker. In contrast, prostatic acid phosphatase was the only elevated marker in 1 per cent of the patients with stage D2 disease and neither marker was elevated in 2 per cent. Among 74 patients in whom prostatic specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase determinations were made before radical prostatectomy, prostatic specific antigen was elevated substantially (greater than 10 ng. per ml.) in 59 per cent (26 of 44) with extracapsular disease and in only 7 per cent (2 of 30) without extracapsular disease. More importantly, of those 28 patients with substantially elevated prostatic specific antigen levels 26 (93 per cent) had extracapsular disease. Serial serum measurements showed that prostatic specific antigen either reflected or predicted clinical status in more than 97 per cent of the patients. We conclude that prostatic specific antigen is an excellent serum tumor marker for monitoring patients with prostatic carcinoma and that it surpasses prostatic acid phosphatase in this regard. Prostatic specific antigen also may be useful in staging prostatic carcinoma and it may change our attitudes significantly about the therapeutic responses to this cancer.\r"

The patient or partner is required to perform a self-injection under nursing supervision before a prescription for home use written. Initial followup visits are scheduled with a nurse at 1 to 2-week intervals. At these visits the nurse identifies possible patient errors in self-injection technique, dose or frequency, and answers questions about the therapy. After the couple has mastered and is comfortable with home injection, followup appointments are scheduled with the physician at 4-week intervals to monitor for possible changes in response to treatment and for an examination of the phallus.\r"

This study strongly suggests that the sensory input from the bladder to the spinal cord, together with alteration in the sensory motor integration that occurs at the level of the interneuron pool, is important in influencing the characteristics of the detrusor contraction following high spinal cord injury. Predictive criteria for failed sphincterotomy are a slow increase to maximum intravesical pressure before voiding and abnormal lumbosacral sensory evoked potentials.\r"

We encountered 3 cases in which anterior valves were located in the glanular urethra. This entity may be misdiagnosed as meatal stenosis and without a high index of suspicion it might be overlooked. The combination of distal obstruction and a normal urethral meatus should lead one to suspect this entity. Observation of the voided stream is extremely helpful in the diagnosis, since voiding urethrography often fails to include the penile tip and urethroscopy of the distal urethra often is unsatisfactory. Treatment can be performed either transurethrally or by excision through the meatus.\r"

Therefore, we studied the records of 506 consecutive patients hospitalized for maldescended testis from January 1949 to December 1960. Testis cancer developed in 6 patients, which when compared to the 1.3 expectant Danish incidence rate, yielded a statistically significant relative risk of 4.7 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.7 to 10.2).

Thiazides reduced urinary calcium excretion and resolved hematuria in all cases. Serum calcium concentration was not altered with treatment. Serum potassium concentration decreased, and total carbon dioxide content and uric acid concentrations increased in response to therapy but these changes did not necessitate discontinuation of treatment. Thiazides were discontinued electively after 16 +/- 15 months of treatment (range 3 to 40 months). Six children maintained normal urinary calcium excretion, while 8 displayed excessive calcium excretion for 16 +/- 4 months after treatment was stopped. Renal calculi were not detected in any patient during this interval but hematuria recurred in 4 children. These findings suggest that thiazides are safe and effective for resolving hypercalciuria and hematuria. Thiazides may be discontinued safely in some children, while others will require further treatment courses or prolonged continuous therapy.\r"

An increased incidence of epididymal anomalies also has been noted in association with cystic fibrosis, von Hippel-Lindau's syndrome and in male offspring of women treated with diethylstilbestrol. The frequency and anatomical spectrum of epididymal anomalies among men with normal descended testes are not known. We describe 3 patients with bilaterally descended testes, who were found to have aberrant epididymal tissue at scrotal or inguinal exploration. The variable presentations of aberrant epididymal tissue in these 3 patients can be explained best by understanding the embryology and anatomy of the epididymis and its associated vestigial structures. In all likelihood the structures encountered in our patients were the ductus aberrans inferior and the paradidymis. These structures, which rarely are included in urological anatomical descriptions of the epididymis, can be significant clinically. Therefore, it is important that the urologist be aware of their existence and their means of presentation.\r"

Specimens of the corpus spongiosum (CS) and corpora cavernosa (CC) were obtained from men with a history of normal penile erection undergoing cystourethrectomy because of bladder malignancy. Preparations were mounted in organ baths and isometric tension was recorded. Deprivation of extracellular calcium abolished electrically induced contractions in both CS and CC preparations within 15 min.; norepinephrine (NE)-induced contractions were reduced by 90% (CS) and 83% (CC) after 30 min. All the CCBs reduced electrically induced contractions concentration-dependently, nifedipine being the most potent agent. Contractions induced by exogenous NE were depressed by about 50%, whereas high K+ (124 mM) induced responses were abolished. It is concluded that contraction in penile erectile tissues is mediated mainly by neuronally released NE stimulating postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptors. The contraction is highly dependent on extracellular calcium and can partly be inhibited by CCBs. It cannot be excluded that some CCBs injected intracavernosally may be useful for diagnosis and even treatment of erectile dysfunction. However, calcium channel blockade may not be as effective as a therapeutic principle as blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors.\r"

Contractions in response to electrical field stimulation, which were abolished using prazosin (2 microM) or tetrodotoxin (one to 1.6 microM), and to noradrenaline were significantly increased in both eight and 16 week diabetic animals. The contractile response to acetylcholine was significantly increased in the 16 week diabetic rats only, when compared with controls. Although these responses were significantly increased, no difference was found in ED50 and EF50 values between control and diabetic rats. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (0.3 microM) had no effect on resting tension or nerve-mediated responses. In seminal vesicles from control animals, both vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunoreactive and acetylcholinesterase-containing nerves were localised around the folds of the columnar epithelium of secretory cells, in contrast to neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive and catecholamine-containing nerves which were found in the smooth muscle layers. In seminal vesicles from both eight and 16 week diabetic animals no difference was seen in distribution or density of acetylcholinesterase-containing nerves; there was an increase in density and fluorescence intensity of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- and neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerves and a decrease in catecholamine-containing nerves compared with controls. The results are discussed in relation to autonomic neuropathy in diabetes.\r"

In eight week animals cystometric recordings showed an increase in bladder capacity associated with a decrease in intraluminal pressure. Concentration-response curves revealed a significant increase in sensitivity of the detrusor to beta,gamma-methylene ATP, a potent purinergic agonist, and a trend towards subsensitivity to acetylcholine in bladders from eight week diabetic rats when compared to controls. The atropine-resistant (purinergic) response to neurogenic stimulation was increased over the frequency range two to 30 Hz and was significantly greater at two Hz. In 16 week animals the cystometrogram had partially recovered; capacity had decreased compared to eight week diabetics and intraluminal pressure was within the normal range. Concentration-response curves revealed no significant difference in the response to acetylcholine and a greatly reduced response to beta,gamma-methylene ATP in the 16 week diabetics compared to controls. The atropine-resistant neurogenic response was slightly, but not significantly reduced. The results are discussed in relation to clinical urodynamic measurements of human detrusor dysfunction in diabetes.\r"

A decrease in the number of shocks necessary for effective treatment offers both technical and clinical benefits. The results presented here demonstrate that it is possible in particular cases to increase substantially the degree of comminution produced using a fixed number of acoustic impulses by exposing the stones to solutions of controlled pH and chemical composition during acoustic shock treatment. The largest increase in comminution was observed for magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate/apatite stones exposed to citrate solutions. The smaller particle sizes are shown to result not only from stone dissolution but also from an increase in the ease of stone fracture during acoustic shocking. The degree of comminution of the largest fragment sizes was also found to be slightly increased for calcium oxalate stones by exposure to synthetic urine of elevated pH. These chemical methods of increased stone comminution appear to be directly applicable to particular cases and may have general clinical utility if suitable conditions affecting all stones can be found.\r"

The cytosolic receptor concentration in both urethra and bladder was about half of that in the vagina. The concentration of nuclear receptors in urethra was not significantly different from that in the vagina, but in the bladder the concentration was only about one fourth of that in the vagina or urethra. The mean KD of cytosolic receptors from bladder was significantly higher than the corresponding values in urethra and vagina. Progesterone binding sites in the bladder had a broader hormonal specificity than those in the urethra or vagina. The present demonstration of specific progesterone receptors in the female urethra might provide a possible link between estrogen progesterone interaction and the appearance of urinary incontinence during pregnancy in women.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently utilized radioligand receptor binding methods to characterize muscarinic cholinergic and alpha adrenergic receptors in human prostate adenomas. The primary advantages of radioligand receptor binding methods are that neurotransmitter receptor density is quantitated, the affinity of unlabelled drugs for receptor sites is determined, and receptors can be localized using autoradiography on slide-mounted tissue sections. Recently, [125I]-Heat, a selective and high affinity ligand with high specific activity (2200 Ci/mmole) has been used to characterize alpha 1 adrenergic receptors in the brain. In this study alpha 1 adrenergic receptors in the dog prostate were characterized using [125I]-Heat. The Scatchard plots were linear indicating homogeneity of [125I]-Heat binding sites. The mean alpha 1 adrenergic receptor density determined from these Scatchard plots was 0.61 +/- 0.07 fmol/mg. wet wt. +/- S.E.M. The binding of [125I]-Heat to canine prostate alpha 1 adrenergic binding sites was of high affinity (Kd = 86 +/- 19 pM). Steady state conditions were reached following an incubation interval of 30 minutes and specific binding and tissue concentration were linear within the range of tissue concentrations assayed. The specificity of [125I]-Heat for alpha 1 adrenergic binding sites was confirmed by competitive displacement assays using unlabelled clonidine and prazosin. Retrospective analysis of the saturation experiments demonstrated that Bmax can be accurately calculated by determining specific [125I]-Heat binding at a single ligand concentration. [125I]-Heat is an ideal ligand for studying alpha 1 adrenergic receptors in the prostate and its favorable properties should facilitate the autoradiographic localization of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors in the prostate.\r"

  ".W": "In previous baboon studies we have shown that porous (60 micron mean internodal distance) polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts heal by ingrowth of endothelium and smooth muscle cells from the adjacent artery and from capillaries penetrating through the interstices of the graft. However, porous grafts (principally made of Dacron) in humans do not heal. This has been attributed to a wound healing deficiency in humans; however, it might be due to an inhibitory effect of the Dacron itself. To examine the latter possibility, we undertook this study to compare the healing of 4 mm internal diameter porous Dacron grafts (USCI, Sauvage Filamentous Knitted) with that of Gore-Tex 60 micron PTFE grafts in baboons (the latter graft not available for clinical use). The grafts were harvested at 2, 4, and 12 weeks and assessed for (1) percentage of endothelial coverage, (2) endothelial cell (EC) proliferation (thymidine labeling index), (3) intimal area, and (4) smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation (thymidine labeling index). The PTFE grafts at all three time points were fully covered, whereas only one of five Dacron grafts was completely covered at 12 weeks. The intima of the PTFE grafts consisted of ECs and SMCs, whereas that of the Dacron grafts contained ECs and SMCs as well as focal accumulations of thrombus. The intimal cross-sectional areas in the Dacron grafts (3.0 +/- 1.2 mm2) were significantly greater than in the PTFE grafts (0.8 +/- 0.6 mm2) at 4 weeks; there was no difference at 12 weeks (Dacron, 2.6 +/- 2.3 mm2 and PTFE, 3.0 +/- 2.5 mm2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Considered in this order, the operative mortality rate was zero, 11%, and 13%, respectively; initial hemodynamic failure was 7%, 13%, and 9%, respectively; 5-year overall primary patency rate was 67%, 62%, and 19%, respectively; and the secondary patency rate was 74%, 82%, and 37%, respectively. However, axillobifemoral patency was made to seem better by including six cases (12 graft limbs) performed because of nonocclusive disease (aneurysm or failure of graft performed for aneurysm). Excluding these, axillobifemoral primary and secondary patency decreased to 47% and 69%, respectively. Femorofemoral bypass results were made worse by cases performed because of unilateral failure of an aortic bifurcation graft. Exclusion of these bypasses increased primary and secondary patency rates to 74% and 82%, respectively. Occlusion of the major outflow artery (superficial femoral) markedly affected long-term patency of all three bypasses. Thus, \"good\" and \"poor\" runoff primary patencies were, respectively, for femorofemoral bypass 79% and 53%, for axillobifemoral bypass 92% and 41%, respectively (occlusive disease only), and for axillounifemoral bypass 54% and zero, respectively. This detailed breakdown of results explains the wide variances in the reported results for these extra-anatomic bypasses and provides a better perspective for their application in different clinical settings.\r"

  ".W": "For the past 15 years at our institution, all acute diabetic foot problems have been treated on the vascular surgery service. The treatment approach has emphasized aggressive local foot surgery and frequent use of revascularization to avoid amputation. A total of 212 urgent or emergent foot operations were performed on 138 limbs in 114 diabetic patients for indications of infection, gangrene, or infected neurotrophic ulcers. The average number of operations per limb was 1.5 (range one to six) and per patients was 1.9 (range one to nine). Ischemia was sufficiently severe to require concurrent lower extremity revascularization in 48 limbs in 43 patients. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 11 years (mean 3 years). Ultimately 36 major lower extremity amputations were required in 33 patients at time intervals ranging from zero to 86 months (mean 7 months) after the initial operation on the affected limb. These data indicate that an aggressive program of surgical treatment of diabetic foot problems combined with liberal use of lower extremity revascularization resulted in long-term salvage of 73% of threatened limbs in these high-risk patients. These results form the basis for our recommendation that major lower extremity amputations be considered only as a last resort in diabetic patients with limbs threatened by foot infection or localized gangrene.\r"

Twelve adult Yorkshire swine with infrarenal aortic atherosclerosis had a 2.5 mm and/or 3.2 mm diameter fiberscope passed into the aorta from the femoral artery after proximal aortic balloon occlusion. Endoscopic argon laser resection of the atherosclerotic plaque was then attempted in eight pigs with an argon laser fiber (60 to 400 microns). We were able to visualize the raised atherosclerotic plaque in all 12 pigs with the larger 3.2 mm diameter fiberscope, which was easily passed into the aortoiliac system from the 4 mm diameter femoral vessel. The articulating end feature enhanced maneuverability within the lumen and allowed laser fiber direction. The 2.5 mm endoscope did not allow adequate visualization in any pig since the vessel could not be cleared of blood. The 2.5 mm endoscope was also passed from the femoral artery distally into the hind limb and still did not allow adequate visualization of the vessel wall because of persistent luminal blood. The 3.2 mm endoscope enabled vessel wall visualization distal to the femoral artery when the proximal artery was occluded. No aortas were grossly perforated by the laser energy. In all pigs undergoing endoscopic laser resection, raised plaques were removed both grossly and histologically, although the plaque edges were carbonized and frayed as well as vaporized. With the small spot size of the argon fiber, channels were drilled through plaque, frequently with incomplete recanalization of the lumen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The clinical value of indium 111-labeled white blood cell (WBC) scanning done after vascular graft procedures was investigated to differentiate noninfectious postoperative inflammation associated with graft incorporation from early prosthetic graft infection. Indium 111-labeled WBC scans were initially obtained in 30 patients before discharge from the hospital and during the subsequent follow-up period (334 days). Fourteen of 30 patients (47%) had normal predischarge scans that included all 10 patients who had grafts confined to the abdomen and 4 of 20 patients (20%) who had grafts arising or terminating at the femoral arteries (p less than 0.05). Sixteen of 30 patients (53%) discharged with abnormal initial indium 111 WBC scans underwent serial scanning until the scan normalized or a graft complication developed. All of the 16 patients had grafts involving the groin region. Abnormal indium 111 uptake in the femoral region continued for a mean 114 days without the development of prosthetic graft infections. The sensitivity of indium 111-labeled WBC scans for detecting wound complications was 100%, whereas the specificity was 50%. Thus, the accuracy of the test was only 53%. We conclude that (1) abnormal indium 111 WBC scans are common after graft operations involving the groin region but are unusual after vascular procedures confined to the abdomen, and (2) in the absence of clinical suspicion, the indium 111-labeled WBC scan does not reliably predict prosthetic graft infection because of the low specificity of the test in the early postoperative period.\r"

There were no treatment complications in this group of patients. This technique of balloon angioplasty is compared with the results of treatment in eight patients with fibromuscular dysplasia of the internal carotid artery, who had percutaneous transfemoral angioplasty. Long-term follow-up revealed the resolution of symptoms in all patients.\r"

Sixty-seven vessels and 17 bypass grafts were examined with a flexible, multichannel, fiberoptic endoscope (outer diameter 2.8 mm), with video projection of a magnified image used during the following operations: femoropopliteal or femorotibial bypass (14), aortofemoral (six), axillopopliteal bypass (one), and femoral embolectomy (three). Preoperative angiograms were compared with the findings at prebypass intraoperative angioscopy. Immediately after bypass, angioscopic appearances of the graft, anastomosis, and distal runoff artery were compared with a completion angiogram. Significant disparity between angioscopy and arteriography occurred in five patients (21%), with resultant change of management in three (12.5%). In comparison to angioscopy, the arteriograms gave a false negative rate of 12.5% (3 of 24) and a false positive rate of 8% (2 of 24). Angioscopy was accurate for assessment of anastomoses in all cases and was particularly beneficial for monitoring balloon catheter embolectomy. Complications were limited to three instances of vasospasm when the scope was used in narrow vessels. No embolization, intimal trauma, infection, or vessel perforation occurred. We conclude that angioscopy promises to be a safe and accurate alternative technique for intraoperative assessment, monitoring anastomotic results and controlling therapeutic procedures.\r"

Twenty-three limbs had three patent tibial arteries, 46 limbs had two tibial arteries, 31 limbs had one patent artery, and five limbs had isolated popliteal segments. Thirty-four percent were repeat operations. Fifty-five patients were allocated to receive PTFE grafts and 50 to receive human umbilical vein grafts. The two groups were comparable as to preoperative risk factors and operative and postoperative treatment. During the first 4 years (maximum 1609 days) 40 PTFE grafts and 24 umbilical veins occluded. At 1 year the PTFE patency rate was 53% and at 4 years was 22%. For umbilical vein the corresponding figures were 74% and 42% (p = 0.005, Gehan test).

A high-pressure balloon was inflated in an area of severe atherosclerotic narrowing. The patient complained of severe pain during inflation and had a vasovagal response. After balloon deflation, angiography displayed extravasation just inferior to the lower edge of the balloon. Immediate inflation of the balloon tamponaded the leak and allowed the patient's transfer to the operating room in stable condition. It is hypothesized that the new high-pressure balloons can overcome resistance in nondistensible arterial walls, causing rupture without balloon rupture.\r"

Mortality rates with high LTPA were similar to those in moderate LTPA; however, combined fatal and nonfatal major CHD events were 20% lower with high as compared with low LTPA (P less than .05).

  ".W": "A fivefold increase in the number of cases of nosocomial coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia was investigated in a neonatal intensive care unit between 1975 and 1982. This apparent outbreak was not the result of increased isolation of coagulase-negative staphylococci from blood cultures nor an increased frequency with which blood cultures were obtained. Rather, it was attributable to a dramatic increase in the overall probability that a positive blood culture would be interpreted as \"bacteremia\" as opposed to a contaminant by both physicians and infection control staff. Specifically, there had been a 62.3% increase in neonatal intensive care unit bed use by very-low-birth-weight (less than 1000-g) infants between 1975 and 1982, and in both years, positive blood cultures were 3.8 times as likely to be perceived as clinically significant if obtained from such tiny infants. The growing number of very-low-birth-weight babies occupying neonatal intensive care unit beds, coupled with the observation that blood cultures positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci are almost four times as likely to be perceived as clinically significant if obtained from extremely premature infants, may account for the reported increase in nosocomial coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia.\r"
