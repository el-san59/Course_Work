It is important to distinguish between impairment and disability. Physical impairment is objective structural limitation; disability is the resulting loss of function. Disability can be assessed by the patient's report of restriction in activities of daily living: bending and lifting, sitting, standing, walking, traveling, socializing, sleep, sex, and putting on or taking off footwear. Detailed statistical analysis of 480 patients identified the most important elements of lumbar impairment as the anatomic and time patterns of pain, lumbar flexion, straight leg raising, neurologic signs, previous surgery, and spinal fractures. Methods of examination need to be improved. An anatomic chart is provided to calculate impairment in the individual patient. The patient's report of pain, disability, and capacity for work should then be compared with the physician's objective assessment of the injury, diagnosis, and lumbar impairment.\r"

A formula for computation of permanent disability as developed by McBride includes functional deficiency and physical disorders, taking into account 12 variables. This formula can be simplified to seven components if the physical disorders are mentally computed into the factors of quickness of action, coordination, strength, security, endurance, safety, and adverse employability, which are given weighted values. This method can provide a valid determination of percentage of disability. Some situations only require a delineation of the impairment present and defer disability determination to an agency or board. Currently, there is a trend toward equating the amount of disability with the loss of earnings, which is quite contrary to the longstanding, traditional view.\r"

  ".W": "It seems clear that the orthopedic surgeon cannot separate impairment from disability. The measurement of impairment is clouded by the inability to measure dynamic function. A range of motion demonstrated by a patient in the doctor's office does not fully describe the functional potential of either the extremity or the spine. Moreover, the rules by which disability is defined are interpreted with a natural sympathy of the physician's care for the patient. The physician may have less sympathy if the individual being reviewed is a client of an insurance company or of an attorney, compared to being a \"private\" patient. In the future, the orthopedic surgeon would focus on the musculoskeletal handicap rather than disability, or function rather than impairment. Function must be measured in a dynamic manner. The guidelines for definition of function or dysfunction should be similar to those used in sports medicine regarding the decision as to when the athlete can resume sports. What was the capacity before injury? How close to the normal capacity has medical care restored function? This includes measurements of passage of time and consideration of the desire to return to previous activity. The goal is the development of methods that will accurately measure dynamic musculoskeletal function. Visceral organ systems have biochemical standards of measurement; comparable standards must be devised for the musculoskeletal system.\r"

In contrast, only 36% of the 66 patients who had the disease more than two years were rated excellent and good. Myelography is valuable in diagnosing and locating lesions. The average number of discs removed was 3.1 per patient. The number of cases with excellent and good results was the same whether or not union of the graft occurred. Reoperation was required in 12 patients, and a third operation was performed in three patients. Eventually, 93% of the patients were able to lead independent lives.\r"

Tangential views more clearly demonstrated details of annular tears and herniated discs in comparison with conventional views. The advantages of tangential views are as follows: precise demonstration of position, width, and shape of the hernial opening (main annular tear); precise demonstration of position and shape of the herniated mass; and a topographic display of disc degeneration. Dermal radiation absorbed during tangential views is less than that of computerized tomographic (CT) scans of discography. In addition, tangential views can be readily made at any hospital. The disadvantages of tangential views are that the X-ray tube direction must be chosen for each individual depending on whether there is a cranially or caudally migrated disc herniation; there is a tendency toward decreased sharpness of the exposure, especially when there are advanced degenerative discs; and, absorbed doses of gonadal radiation are higher during caudocranial tangential views than during CT discography in women.\r"

The authors skin-tested 292 chemonucleolysis candidates; five were positive and 287 were negative. None of the positive patients were injected with chymopapain. There were no instances of unequivocal chymopapain anaphylaxis in the skin test-negative group. This 0% incidence of anaphylaxis in skin test-negative patients was compared with a population estimate of 1%, based on historical data. The resulting value of p = 0.08 value fell short of the conventional level of significance of 0.05. The p value will reach 0.05 when the series of skin test-negative patients without anaphylaxis reaches 360.

Scoliosis may be associated with spondylolisthesis. The scoliosis may be sciatic or structural. These may be true structural curves or secondary to the asymmetric slip of the spondylolithesis. Grade 4 spondylolithesis was treated with an in situ ala-transverse fusion combined with posterior decompression. The tension signs were rapidly dissipated. A plaster spica was applied for six months. Solid fusion was achieved without progression of spondylolisthesis or further rotation. Subsequently, the structural scoliosis was treated with a two-stage anterior release and posterior Harrington fusion. The progression of spondylolisthesis in Marfan syndrome may be related to the poor quality of the surrounding musculoligamentous structures. Sciatic scoliosis resolves after fusion of the spondylolithesis. The results of in situ fusion are satisfactory. Reduction of the spondylolithesis with combined anterior and posterior fusion offers the most satisfactory basis for subsequent treatment of a structural scoliosis but carries a significant risk of neurologic damage and recurrence of slip.\r"

The change in alignment is governed by the position of the prosthesis within the femoral canal. If the stem of the prosthesis is positioned posteriorly in the canal, external rotation simulates valgus; internal rotation results in a varus orientation. If the prosthetic stem is located anteriorly in the canal, the reverse is true. This effect was noted in all specimens for values as small as 20 degrees of rotation.

When immobilization, whatever its cause, cannot be avoided, every attempt should be made to minimize it and to try to treat its harmful effects. There is some evidence that early mobilization, traction, and continuous passive motion overcome the harmful effects of immobilization, but more knowledge on this subject is needed.

In a review of the literature, significant differences were noted between the well-encapsulated and the diffusely infiltrative lipofibromatous hamartoma types of intraneural lipomas. The average age at the time of appearance of the well-encapsulated type is 45 years, with female predominance, while the infiltrative type arises in a younger age group (average age, eight years) with no sexual predominance. To avoid a recurrence, total excision is recommended in cases of the well-encapsulated type. Attempts to excise the diffusely infiltrative type are likely to fail.\r"

The overall preoperative Hospital for Special Surgery knee-rating score was 58 and improved to 81 post-operatively. The average postrevision range of motion was 83 degrees. The soft tissue sleeve, the built-in constraint of the prosthesis, and the restoration of the bone deficiency provided good stability, despite the loss of the collateral and cruciate ligaments. Radiolucent lines, less than 1 mm in width and incomplete, appeared in four femoral and ten tibial bone-cement interfaces. In one femoral component there was a 2-mm radiolucency with a cement fracture at the femoral stem tip. There were no failures or repeated revisions, but two knees required postoperative manipulation to improve motion. Total Condylar III type prosthesis can be satisfactorily used to salvage failed hinge TKA.\r"

Of the arthroplasties, 90% were excellent or good results. Superior results were obtained when the mechanical axis fell in the center of the knee (Zone C) or slightly medial to the center (Zone 2). Causes of failure included fractures, femoral component loosening, and excessive lateral compartment or patellofemoral wear. Cartier and Villers' preoperative templating system was modified for intraoperative alignment with the mechanical axis falling into Zone C or Zone 2.\r"

The bones are then approximated and fixed in 20 degrees-30 degrees of dorsoflexion with two compression screws. The operation should shorten the toe 1.0 to 1.5 cm and give it a moderately valgus orientation. No additional fixation is used. Twenty patients were treated in a prospective study, and all fusions healed. After one year, 13 patients were free of symptoms, five had minimal symptoms, and two still had pain; poor results may be related to the malposition of the fused joint. The technique was simple, involved limited discomfort for the patient, and generally produced a functioning forefoot.\r"

  ".W": "Discomfort in the low back is a common problem that has been investigated for centuries. The need to cope has not changed, but for the past 50 years, the way in which one copes has been dramatically changed by the interaction of a pathophysiologic insight within a legal construct. The development of the concept of \"ruptured disc\" as a cause of backache allowed, for the first time, the perception that a drastic dissolution of anatomy accompanied the discomfort. Regardless of the precipitant, the inference of \"trauma\" was compelling. This heuristic pathophysiologic inference found a ready ear in the Workers' Compensation Insurance system. If backache is a personal injury, it would be compensable if it arise out of and in the course of employment. Today one no longer suffers a backache; one \"injures\" one's back. The experience is further confounded if the sufferer perceives himself as an injured worker. He must prove his persisting illness in an adversarial climate that questions the validity of his symptoms and their pathogenesis on the job. In this contest, the worker, the clinician, and the ethical fabric of Workers' Compensation all fare poorly.\r"

A careful recording of the anatomic impairment should be made because this is critical in determining the subsequent functional activities of the extremity. The measurement criteria for clinical and functional evaluation includes condition assessment instruments. Some assess the neurovascular system, others assess movements including the monitoring of articular motion and musculotendinous function. Sensibility assessment instruments measure sympathetic response and detect single joint stimulus, discrimination, quantification, and recognition abilities. A detailed description of each assessment is recorded and physical capacity evaluation is only one component of the entire vocational evaluation. This evaluation answers questions regarding the injured worker's ability to return to his previous job. The work simulator is a useful instrument that allows rehabilitation and testing of the injured upper extremity. Job site evaluation includes assessment criteria for work performance, work behavior, and work environment.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 16.5% of the adult population in the United States is disabled. About half of the disabled are severely limited and unable to work regularly. Musculoskeletal disorders are the most frequent type of disability. In the United States, there are three major types of disability insurance: Social Security Disability Insurance (a federal program), Workers' Compensation Insurance (usually a state-regulated program), and private health insurance. Recent years have seen a greater demand for private long-term disability insurance, as the trend increases toward less than total reliance on public programs to support disabled workers. The most recent statistics available indicate that Social Security Disability Insurance benefits are currently about $16.8 billion per year; workers' compensation benefits, $16.1 billion; and private disability income protection benefits, $5.2 billion. These figures add up to almost $40 billion in insurance costs. However, insurance costs are only part of the total cost because not everyone is covered by insurance, and insurance does not cover all disabilities. Disability can never be totally prevented or eliminated, but disability and its costs can be substantially reduced through more effective treatment and rehabilitation, including patient education and vocational rehabilitation.\r"

The control and weight-concern group chose 10 mg d-amphetamine significantly more often than placebo. Neither the choice behavior nor the subjective effects of the drug indicated that amphetamine was a more effective positive reinforcer in the experimental groups, because of either its anorectic properties or its presumed antidepressant properties.

All pain-rating scales were correlated (P less than 0.001) with each other and they showed a good internal consistency. There were no differences in correlation coefficients between the age groups and the two sexes.

The clearance to metabolite showed a preferential induction of the norantipyrine pathway with different proportions after antipyrine and rifampin; rifampin, 1200 mg, also enhanced the 4-hydroxyantipyrine pathway further. After antipyrine, diazepam total body clearance was increased by 102%, affecting all metabolic pathways to a similar extent. After rifampin in both doses, diazepam total body clearance rose equally to 300% and desmethyl- and 3-hydroxydiazepam metabolic clearance to 400%.

A correlation was observed between caffeine clearance and a urinary ratio based on the molar recovery of paraxanthine 7-demethylation products relative to a paraxanthine 8-hydroxylation product (r = 0.91; P less than 0.001). Analysis of urinary metabolites was undertaken in a larger population to assess the effects of gender, age, oral contraceptives, and smoking on the ratio. No gender differences were observed in either adults or children; children (n = 21) showed a higher (P less than 0.001) mean metabolite ratio than adults (n = 61), oral contraceptive users (n = 9) had lower (P less than 0.05) ratios than women not taking oral contraceptives (n = 30), and smokers (n = 26) had higher (P less than 0.001) ratios than nonsmokers (n = 61).

We assessed the effect of probenecid on response to the 20 mg dose. A dose intermediate to the 10 and 20 mg doses appeared equally natriuretic to 40 mg furosemide. Although total clearance was the same with all doses (about 0.45 ml/min/kg), renal clearance and the fraction of unchanged drug appearing in the urine decreased with higher doses raising the question of saturable renal secretion. Urinary dose-response curves showed torasemide to be five times as potent as furosemide. Probenecid pretreatment decreased both urine volume (P = 0.0016) and sodium excretion (P = 0.0003), implying that delivery of drug to the urinary side of the nephron is the major determinant of response.\r"

AMX was absorbed more slowly when ingested with diet I than with diet II: the absorption rate constant was 1.04 +/- 0.37 and 1.75 +/- 0.75 (P less than 0.05); lag time for absorption was 0.34 +/- 0.13 hours and 0.29 +/- 0.11 hours (P less than 0.05). The first-order rate constant and elimination half-life were similar. Bioavailability was higher with diet I: the AUC was 12.17 +/- 3.04 vs. 9.65 +/- 2.64 micrograms/ml/hr with diet II (P less than 0.05). A higher content of dietary fiber increased AMX absorption rate and decreased the amount of drug absorbed.\r"

All subjects were non-obese males of comparable age. Earlier findings of increased BP both in normoglycaemic subjects with family histories of type 2 diabetes and in IGT subjects were confirmed. The mean serum urate concentration was significantly higher in the hereditary group than in controls, and intermediate in IGT subjects. The ouabain-sensitive 22Na+ efflux rate constant was significantly decreased in IGT subjects without any concomitant change in the number of [3H]ouabain binding sites. No differences in any of the rate constants for 22Na+ efflux, or in the number of [3H]ouabain binding sites, were noted between the hereditary group and controls. The ability of deproteinized plasma samples to interfere with [3H]ouabain binding to test platelets from one healthy individual was similar in all three groups. The present findings are not consistent with the hypothesis that the BP increase in normoglycaemic subjects with family histories of type 2 diabetes is linked to a disturbance in sodium transport. Our data suggest a decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activity in IGT, which may be of pathophysiological significance in relation to hypertension.\r"

The blood supply was occluded by placing a clamp around the renal artery near to the aorta (group 1), near to the renal hilus (group 2) or by clamping the renal pedicle after prior separation of the kidney from perirenal tissue (group 3). During ischaemia right kidneys had increased urine flow rates and excretion of sodium and water, but inulin clearances (CIn) remained unchanged. After ischaemia left kidneys were isosthenuric with depressed CIn. Occlusion of the renal artery alone resulted in nonoliguric kidneys in which CIn was reduced to 10% and 1% respectively for groups 1 and 2. The most severe damage to function was seen in the kidneys of group 3 which were oliguric and in which CIn was depressed to 0.1% of the pre-ischaemic value. It is concluded that the pedicle clamp method produced complete renal ischaemia and the most severe damage to function. Occlusion of the renal artery produced incomplete ischaemia and a less severe fall in function which depended upon the site of occlusion.\r"

On separate occasions, either a load containing 5 mmol of calcium chloride and 21 mmol of citrate in the form of sodium potassium citrate or a citrate-free vehicle load corrected for pH and cations was ingested. CaA was measured over 3 h with a 47Ca-85Sr double tracer method. After citrate administration, 10 min fractional CaA decreased significantly from 30 to 110 min post-load, and 3 h cumulative CaA dropped to 54.6 +/- (SEM) 6.1% of the total dose as opposed to 76.3 +/- 4.5% after vehicle administration (P less than 0.002). Citrate administration raised serum and urinary citrate, but had little effect on blood acid-base status. After both loads, urinary specific activity of 47Ca significantly correlated with 3 h cumulative CaA, while citrate administration decreased urinary calcium excretion only slightly as compared with vehicle. The results suggest that, in man, higher doses of oral citrate inhibit CaA, probably by way of intraluminal complexation of calcium by citrate. The finding might help explain the fall in urinary calcium excretion observed in patients treated with alkali citrate for recurrent calcium urolithiasis.\r"

Measurement of 32P-labelling of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate revealed no differences in the rate of incorporation of the isotope in essential hypertensive patients compared with controls. In the normotensive offspring of essential hypertensive patients there was a highly significant increase in the rate of 32P incorporation (P less than 0.01), compared with matched controls, indicating a higher rate of metabolic turnover in these subjects. These data demonstrate that phosphoinositide metabolism is enhanced in subjects genetically at risk of hypertension, before the blood pressure has risen, but once the blood pressure is established, it is no different from control values. Abnormal phosphoinositide metabolism may be a further manifestation of a genetically determined defect of membrane physicochemical function underlying essential hypertension.\r"

In human liver, carnitine acetyltransferase activity was 10-14 times higher and carnitine octanoyltransferase 1.7-2.4 times higher than in rat liver, while carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity was similar in human and rat. Acetyl-CoA hydrolase and octanoyl-CoA hydrolase activities were lower in human (42-57%) than in rat liver, but palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity was similar in both species. The activity of citrate synthase was lower (44%) in human than in rat liver. The low citrate synthase activity and the high carnitine acetyltransferase in human liver suggest that in man acetylcarnitine might be more important as a vehicle for export of acetyl units from mitochondria than citrate. The high activity of carnitine acetyltransferase in human liver is consistent with the observation that acetylcarnitine is the predominant acylcarnitine excreted in diabetic ketosis in man. It is concluded that the rat may not be a valid model for carnitine metabolism in man, and that in human liver carnitine may have an important role in transfer of acetyl groups out of mitochondria and possibly also to extra-hepatic tissues.\r"

In the rats fed on the 30% protein diets, there were massive proteinuria, progressive increases in serum creatinine and focal glomerular sclerosis associated with severe tubulo-interstitial changes. With the 5% dietary protein, proteinuria was decreased, the levels of serum creatinine were preserved within normal ranges and renal histological changes diminished. Weight loss and hypoproteinaemia were more marked. With intermediate protein restriction (10% protein), renal function and plasma protein were preserved but body weight did not increase normally. Aggregated human immunoglobulin G, which had been intravenously injected at weeks 12 and 24, accumulated in the glomeruli more densely in rats fed on the 30% protein diet than in those fed on the 10% or 5% protein diets. We tentatively conclude that functional and histological deterioration of focal glomerular sclerosis can be prevented by appropriate restriction of dietary protein; however, severe protein restriction does aggravate nutritional states.\r"

  ".W": "The physiological changes of pregnancy have been shown to alter the disposition of some drugs. However, there are no data on the possible influence of pregnancy or its complications on drug effect. We have applied drug concentration-effect analysis to determine whether pregnancy influences the action of propranolol. Twelve women with pregnancy induced hypertension were studied during the third trimester and again 2-3 months post partum. On each occasion propranolol (10 mg) was given intravenously and measurements of heart rate, blood pressure and whole blood propranolol concentration were determined over the ensuing 8 h. Pregnancy did not alter propranolol disposition. Clearance was 0.63 +/- 0.18 and 0.71 +/- 0.24 litre h-1 kg-1, and volume of distribution at steady state was 4.02 +/- 2.98 and 3.07 +/- 1.58 litres/kg during and after pregnancy respectively. There was no fall in blood pressure over the period of the acute study. The reduction in heart rate (beats/min per ng of propranolol/ml) was greater during compared with after pregnancy: -0.61 +/- 0.23 and -0.39 +/- 0.19 respectively (F = 6.64; df 1.9; P less than 0.03). There was no relationship between blood pressure or pretreatment heart rate and the slope of the concentration-effect relationship. We conclude that pregnancy can significantly alter drug effect in the absence of any pharmacokinetic changes. These findings suggest that therapeutic ranges established in non-pregnant patients may not be applicable during pregnancy.\r"

Perfused intestines removed from anaesthetized rats, and thus never deprived of a supply of oxygen, maintain their structural integrity even after perfusion for 1 h provided that a Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate perfusate is used. However, intestines removed from freshly killed rats show severe villus disruption and oedema after perfusion for only 20 min. Extensive damage to both crypts and villi is observed in everted sacs of small intestine incubated for 20 min, regardless of the buffer system used. Intestinal rings show damage at the tips of the villi after incubation for 2 min, but otherwise remain morphologically intact; this damage is progressive with time. It is concluded that the exact mode of preparation of intestinal tissue is critical for preservation of structural and functional integrity and that this is especially important in quantitative studies on transport processes. Further, it is recommended that routine monitoring of the integrity of intestinal preparations in vitro is desirable and that histological assessment is an appropriate technique.\r"

At most concentrations, mediated influx of glycylsarcosine was depressed by Li+, K+, Cs+ and Tris, though not abolished. At high concentrations, it was moderately increased by choline and mannitol. Under conditions in which the tissue could concentrate the peptide in the presence of Na+, uptake was greatly depressed by all the substituents and the ability to concentrate was abolished. The Kt of mediated influx was affected in different ways according to the substituent used. Kt was reduced by Li+ replacement of Na+ and increased by choline replacement. Vmax was greatly reduced by all metallic substituents but not by non-metallic substituents. Though the results cannot yet be satisfactorily interpreted, they suggest possible reasons for previous conflicting results and show that it is impossible to make the unqualified statement that transport of glycylsarcosine is 'Na+-dependent'. It is now doubtful whether transport of this peptide into the intestinal cells is by co-transport with Na+, and the whole matter of Na+-dependence of intestinal peptide transport is in question.\r"

Previously, nine other subjects had participated in a pilot study to assess the safety of the chlorpropamide dose and to ensure that adequate plasma chlorpropamide levels were achieved. No subject was negative for chlorpropamide alcohol flushing, as defined by the following criteria: facial temperature rise of 35% or more of maximum possible rise, observer assessment or subject assessment. In 26 of the total 32 subjects, all three criteria were fulfilled. Thus, among young, healthy non-diabetic adults chlorpropamide alcohol flushing would appear to be a normal phenomenon.\r"

Adrenal concentrations (means +/- SE) of adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine in rats fed a normal diet were 1471 +/- 335, 527 +/- 75 and 51 +/- 12 nmol/g in the medulla, and 66 +/- 17, 18 +/- 9 and 6 +/- 1 nmol/g in the zona glomerulosa. The dopamine content of the zona glomerulosa was greater than could be accounted for by simple contamination from the medullary catecholamines and is commensurate with that of tissue with dopaminergic innervation. Adrenal noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations and plasma catecholamine and corticosterone concentrations were not affected by dietary sodium intake. Plasma aldosterone concentrations were greater than 3030.4, 339.8 +/- 41.5 and 55.2 +/- 11.0 pmol/l in rats fed low, normal and high sodium diets respectively. Five weeks after right adrenalectomy and nephrectomy and left adrenal enucleation, ARH rat systolic blood pressure had increased by 47 mmHg.

In upper airway obstruction in which stridor is the hallmark, decisions about the severity of the condition are based almost exclusively on clinical examination. Intrathoracic lesions, however, require both careful clinical and laboratory evaluation. Although each disease requires specific attention, these principles of management should prove helpful when treating the child with respiratory distress.\r"

Using our canine hypovolemic shock model, END levels were analyzed during the baseline period, at the beginning of treatment (after a period of fixed-pressure hypovolemic shock), and at the end of treatment. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output were also measured at these intervals. Animals were given iv 5 ml of 0.9% NaCl, 4 mg/kg of naloxone (NAL), 30 mg/kg of methylprednisolone (MP), or 4 mg/kg of NAL and 30 mg/kg of MP. A fifth group was composed of nonsteroid-treated animals. Scatterplots were generated and linear regression lines were drawn comparing END with cardiac output and MAP. In the nonsteroid-treated animals, a significant correlation was found between decreases in both MAP and cardiac output and increasing levels of END. The addition of MP did not seem to alter the relationship, suggesting that MP did not affect END release.\r"

These analyses revealed a correlation between worsening neurologic deficit and the peak CK (r = .87, p less than .001), AST (r = .75, p less than .01), and lactate (r = .93, p less than .001) levels. Lactate increased before enzymes did. In 12 patients without complications, only lactate was significantly (p less than .005) elevated; however, within this group, CK but not lactate could be used to differentiate patients who later developed subtle mental changes. Although CPB appeared to induce metabolic changes in the brain that could possibly disturb function, severe cerebral damage appeared to require additional global or focal anoxic-ischemic factors. Short hypothermia during bypass did not influence CK, but it was falsely elevated after prolonged hypothermic periods. The testing of these enzymes may be a reliable indicator of the degree of brain damage and the prognosis.\r"

Mean SMC/IGFI concentration in these critically ill patients was below the lower limit of the reference range. SMC/IGFI concentrations correlated with NB for the 24 h before measurement (r = .38, p less than .01) and with cumulative NB for the previous 2 (r = .50, p less than .01), 3 (r = .34, p less than .05), and 5 days (r = .46, p less than .05). Prealbumin correlated with cumulative 5-day NB (r = .39, p less than .05). Plasma albumin and transferrin concentrations did not correlate with NB for any of these time periods. SMC/IGFI concentrations correlated with cumulative protein (r = .59, p less than .01), carbohydrate (r = .63, p less than .01), and energy intake (r = .64, p less than .01).

Nine random-source, mongrel dogs were anesthetized, shaved, and internally heated until the core temperature reached 43.0 degrees C. The animals were then randomly assigned to be cooled to 37 degrees C either by iced (1 degree C) tap water gastric lavage (n = 5200 ml/min) through a large (32-Fr) orogastric tube, or by spraying with tap water (n = 4, 15 degrees C, 12 L/min) before a large fan blowing room temperature air (23 degrees C) across the dog at 0.5 m/sec from a height of 50 cm. Temperatures were monitored by thermocouples in both tympanic membranes and the pulmonary artery. BP, pulse, and cardiac output were measured every 5 min. Evaporative cooling was twice as fast as iced gastric lavage (0.16 +/- .05 degree vs. 0.08 +/- .01 degree C/min X m2, p less than .01). Animals in the evaporatively cooled group also experienced a quicker and more complete return to baseline cardiac indices than the lavage-treated group. Moreover, all animals treated with evaporation survived and were neurologically intact 48 h later, while only one lavage-treated dog was neurologically intact over the same period. The others in the lavage group died one hour after cooling (n = 1), were grossly ataxic (n = 1), or were persistently comatose (n = 2). A simple evaporative cooling technique, readily available in the emergency department, appears to be the most rapid and effective means for cooling and treating heatstroke in the dog.\r"

In normal subjects, naloxone pharmacokinetics are characterized by rapid distribution and elimination. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of high-dose naloxone in four patients with septic shock and multiorgan failure. The pharmacokinetics of naloxone in these patients can be described by a two-compartment model with a rapid alpha distribution similar to that observed in normal humans. However, in these critically ill patients there was virtually no drug elimination as levels were followed for 5 h post-termination of a 6-h infusion of 2.4 mg/kg X h. This dramatic accumulation of naloxone may explain why responses have been reported by others to small doses of naloxone in septic shock patients. No significant side-effects were seen in our patients with plasma naloxone levels as high as 3.78 micrograms/ml. Caution is warranted when one administers naloxone to patients whose ability to eliminate this drug is minimal.\r"

These traumatized rats were characterized by a survival time of 108 +/- 19 min, a 12-fold increase in plasma cathepsin D activity, and a three-fold increase in plasma myocardial depressant factor (MDF) activity. PGE1 (1.2 micrograms/kg X min) significantly improved survival time during traumatic shock (191 +/- 29 vs. 108 +/- 19 min), drug vs. vehicle, respectively (p less than .03). In addition, PGE1 significantly attenuated plasma MDF activity during traumatic shock (58 +/- 10 vs. 27 +/- 7 U/ml), vehicle vs. drug, respectively (p less than .02). Plasma cathepsin D activity was also significantly retarded (12.1 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.70 +/- 1.50 U/ml), vehicle vs. drug, respectively (p less than .01). PGE1 appears to exert a membrane stabilizing effect, decreasing plasma cathepsin D and attenuating MDF production. PGE1 thus appears to have significant antishock activity.\r"

An intermittent air injection suction system (IAIS) has been developed in which small (20 to 30 mm) amounts of air are injected two to three times a minute. Very low (20 mm Hg) suction levels are applied. The hypothesis of the present study is that such a device will prevent suction-induced gastric mucosal damage, probably produced by suctioning of mucosa into the holes of the NG tube. IAIS should prevent this by physically expelling the mucosa out of the holes and allowing use of much lower suction levels. In 25 animals, gastric suction for 24 h in anesthetized dogs routinely produced ulcers. However, IAIS produced significantly fewer ulcers and in fewer animals. In 37 animals, the effectiveness of suction, measured by recovery of fluid instilled in the stomach, and the tendency of the tube to block were studied. Effectiveness was the same for all modes studied. Blockage was significantly less with IAIS.\r"

It has been postulated that LDV may be a useful monitor of cardiac output changes. To test this hypothesis, LDV was evaluated in 67 critically ill adult patients with simultaneous measurements of cardiac index (CI) and other physiologic variables. Heated and unheated laser probes were utilized. The results indicate that LDV reflects acute directional changes of CI. Further, with the heated laser probe, the magnitude of acute CI change is reflected. However, there are gradual changes over time of LDV which may occur independently of CI or other monitored variables. Hence, absolute LDV values are not predictive of absolute CI values.\r"

  ".W": "Traditional concepts of shock therapy have been based on conventional monitoring. However, the availability of invasive monitoring systems has provided the means to describe the patterns of oxygen transport in various acute life-threatening illnesses. Surgical trauma provides a useful model for investigation of other shock syndromes, because measurements may be made in the preoperative control period, during the hemodynamic crisis intraoperatively, and sequentially throughout the postoperative period for survivors and nonsurvivors. This provides a time-related pattern of physiologic events that may form the basis for the physiologic evaluation of mechanisms operative in survivors and nonsurvivors. Physiologic alterations which are compensatory may be identified from the survivor pattern and differentiated from decompensations associated with the lethal course. The DO2 pattern reflects circulatory functional changes which may limit body metabolism as reflected by VO2. The body compensates for tissue hypoxia and increased metabolic needs by increased flow and DO2 in sepsis and trauma, and by increased oxygen extraction in hemorrhagic and cardiogenic shock where flow is limited. The interactions of survivors' hemodynamic and oxygen transport patterns define compensatory responses which primarily are increased cardiac output, DO2, and VO2. Inadequate compensations and decompensations of shock are clearly manifest by the nonsurvivor pattern. Therapeutic goals may be defined by the values of the survivor patterns; reduced mortality and morbidity result when these goals are vigorously applied prospectively (17-19).\r"

Of the patients with CMV infection, disseminated disease was documented in 23 (59 percent) and pneumonitis in 31 (80 percent). Although the majority of patients with CMV pneumonitis had additional forms of pulmonary pathology, CMV was the only causative agent identified in two patients with severe pulmonary disease.

Antibody titers, the flora of the sputum, respiratory infections or pneumonias, and deaths were monitored. The patients' antibody titers before immunization were higher than healthy control subjects. Titers rose normally in those vaccinated but declined more rapidly. Differences between the group receiving placebo and vaccine were not significant at 12 and 24 months. The incidence of pneumonia was high before and after vaccine (47/1,000 vs 41/1,000 patient-years). Nonpneumococcal causes predominated (73 percent of pneumonias; 83.4 percent of lethal pneumonias). Isolates from sputum were predominantly nonvaccine types (50 to 62.5 percent). Twenty-seven patients died; pneumonia occurred in six (one pneumococcal in a vaccinated patient) as a terminal complication of other diseases. Thus, although pneumonia occurred frequently in these patients with COPD and contributed to mortality in 22 percent (six) of the 27 deaths, the predominance of nonpneumococcal causes and the data on antibodies and sputum suggest that pneumococcal vaccine may not be as beneficial for patients with COPD as was hoped. More observations are needed.\r"

Six patients with lung abscess who failed to respond to conservative medical management were treated by percutaneous catheter drainage using small catheters (10 Fr or smaller). Five patients showed prompt clinical improvement and the sixth improved after a modification in antibiotic therapy. All patients recovered with radiographic resolution of the abscess and were well at followup periods from two months to two years. In such patients, percutaneous drainage with small catheters provides an excellent clinical result with minimal risk and trauma.\r"

Patients with cardiac rupture after AMI were compared with age- and sex-matched control patients with fatal AMI not related to rupture and with AMI survivors discharged home. Rupture was found in 40 patients (15.7 percent of hospital deaths), or 2.3 percent of all cases of AMI. At the highest risk for rupture were women aged 60 to 69, although the age distribution did not differ significantly from that of patients dying of other causes. More patients with myocardial rupture had hypertension during hospitalization, persistent pain, and inferior wall myocardial infarction when compared with controls. The majority (95 percent) of cardiac ruptures occurred within the first six days, 40 percent within the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Approximately 20 percent of ruptures were diagnosed as subacute; in only two was surgical intervention attempted unsuccessfully. The high-risk group of patients should be carefully monitored within the first six days after the onset of symptoms of AMI in an effort to prevent myocardial rupture.\r"

In group 2 (pulmonary hypertension with no or slight tricuspid regurgitation) lung volumes increased significantly within normal ranges after surgery. However, group 3 patients (pulmonary hypertension and moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation, restrictive and obstructive impairment, uneven alveolar ventilation, disturbed diffusing capacity) did not recover after surgery. The regional perfusion distribution by 133Xe, expressed as the upper over lower lung field ratio, showed significant changes after surgery in groups 1 and 2, but no change in group 3. In groups 1 and 2 it seems that lung parenchyma and pulmonary vessels were not greatly damaged, while in group 3 organic changes in the lung occurred.\r"

Correlations between right ventricular free wall thickness and pulmonary artery pressure were weak (r = 0.51 and 0.57). Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure was also weakly correlated with right ventricular dimensions (r = 0.45 to 0.51), whereas right ventricular area fractional shortening was not correlated with hemodynamic parameters. Patients with previous episode of right heart failure had larger right ventricles than those without such episodes.

All 24 patients achieved partial or complete clinical response to chemotherapy and were considered adequate medical candidates for surgical resection. Fifteen patients underwent a lobectomy or pneumonectomy, 13 of whom had residual tumor in the resected specimen. Of the nine remaining patients, seven had no tumor found on biopsy at thoracotomy and two had unresectable mediastinal node involvement. No chemotherapy was administered postoperatively in any patient until disease progression or relapse was documented. Median survival for the entire group was 19 months and did not differ according to the surgical procedure performed. Nineteen patients had relapse. Patients undergoing biopsy only recurred locally in six of seven cases a median of five months post-thoracotomy (range one to six months). Two \"biopsy only\" patients were tumor free at 34+ and 56+ months. Local recurrence was observed in six of 12 resected patients, while six patients experienced only extrathoracic metastases. Median time to recurrence for resected patients was also five months. Four resected patients experienced late recurrence 16 to 36 months postoperatively and were alive with tumor at 29+ to 42+ months. Two resected patients were tumor-free at 13+ and 37+ months. Post-chemotherapy surgical resection was feasible in limited-stage patients and improved local control of disease.\r"

Respiration is one of the parameters considered for rate control. The aim of our study was to determine how respiratory parameters such as ventilation, tidal volume, and respiratory rate are capable of controlling the pacemaker rate, especially when measured indirectly by means of impedance plethysmography. We examined four volunteers and eight patients with implanted cardiac pacemakers using bicycle ergometry at increasing work loads. We recorded heart rate, uptake of oxygen, and ventilation directly (by pneumotachygraphy) and indirectly (by chest wall impedance plethysmography). A good correlation of directly to indirectly measured ventilation (r = 0.8687) was found. Our study suggests that respiratory minute volume is more appropriate for rate control of physiologic pacemakers than tidal volume or respiratory rate alone. Measurement by means of impedance plethysmography is sufficiently precise to be used for this purpose. Further studies must be conducted as to the optimum realization within an implantable device.\r"

  ".W": "Shortness of breath is a chief complaint of many individuals with cardiopulmonary diseases. Exercise testing is often used to help differentiate cardiac from pulmonary involvement. In assessing pulmonary dysfunction during exercise it is essential to know the point at which ventilatory limitation will occur. Numerous authors have presented regression equations based on the FEV1 for predicting either MVV or VEmax. Resting pulmonary function studies were obtained from 53 patients with COPD. Symptom-limited maximal exercise testing was completed on a cycle ergometer using increments of 10 watts/min. Each regression equation for predicting MVV or VEmax was then applied to the data set. Results showed that the FEV1 correlated with the measured VEmax (r = .81) as did PEF (r = .81), MVV (r = .78), IC (r = .78), DCO (r = .68), VA (r = .67), VE (r = .65) and FVC (r = .64). Single post-bronchodilator FEV1 measurements ranged from 0.56 to 1.64 L (mean 1.0 L) while VEmax ranged from 16 to 78 L/min (mean 37.69 L/min). The equation VEmax = 37.5 X FEV1 was the most robust equation found in the literature for predicting VEmax in this sample. This equation was not statistically different from the line of identity when predicted VEmax was plotted against the measured VEmax. The intercept was 0.91 with a slope of 0.98. In addition, this equation had a smaller mean square error in predicting VEmax than those of the other equations investigated.\r"

However, oxygen is expensive and the portability of home oxygen is limited by the weight and bulk of the oxygen source. As a result, there has been a recent surge of interest in creating oxygen-conserving devices and methods. The efficiency of oxygen therapy can be improved over steady flow delivery by focusing oxygen delivery to early inspiration. Three methods for improving oxygen delivery efficiency--transtracheal catheter, reservoir cannula and demand-pulse oxygen delivery--are currently available for patient use. Each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. By using oxygen conservation methods, the oxygen required to achieve adequate blood oxygenation can be reduced by a factor of 2:1 to 7:1 compared to steady flow. Thus, the cost of oxygen can be substantially reduced while increasing the portability and range of home oxygen therapy.\r"

Exercise for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has often been recommended as an adjunct to physical therapy, although aerobic exercise has not resulted in weight gain in CF. Compared to a three-month control period, six months of VWT resulted in significant increase in weight (2.88 kg, p less than .02), muscle size (1.6 to 1.8 cm upper arm, p less than .01), strength (increase from 16 to 32 muscle groups at normal strength, p less than .005), and decrease in residual volume (1.77 L, p less than .03) and RV/TLC (12.4 percent, p less than .02). There was no significant improvement in other measures of pulmonary or social function. VWT appears to be a form of exercise in which even moderately ill CF patients can engage safely, leading to desired weight gain and increased strength. These results warrant further study of the effects of VWT on pulmonary function and CF morbidity.\r"

Multiple discriminant analysis was used to determine the important variables contributing to the occurrence of SA. Variable included age, sex, history of previous MI, hypertension, location of MI, moist rales at time of admission, cardiothoracic ratio, ejection fraction, wall motion abnormality, exercise test result, duration of exercise and use of digitalis. Moist rales, digitalis, age and cardiothoracic ratio were the predictors of SA. Aging, hemodynamic change imposed on the left ventricle, and arrhythmic effects of digitalis are the major factors associated with SA in the late hospital phase of acute MI.\r"

Protein and LDH levels, and their pleural fluid-to-serum ratios, resulted in erroneous classification of 11 to 15 percent of the effusions. Mean cholesterol level in malignant effusions was 94 mg/dl, 76 mg/dl in inflammatory effusions and 30 mg/dl in the transudates. Using a dividing line of 60 mg/dl to separate the exudates from the transudates, only 5 percent were incorrectly classified. Elevated cholesterol levels in exudates seem to be independent of the serum levels. Our findings indicate that the pleural fluid cholesterol level is a simple and cost-effective aid in differentiating exudative from transudative pleural effusions.\r"

We subjected nine stable hypoxemic COLD patients to exercise at 0 (control), 24 (experimental) and 48 hrs (recovery) after phosphate infusion. Baseline variables were identical for each time period. Exercise responses at 0 and 48 hours were also indistinguishable. Exercise response at 24 hrs differed from those at 0 and 48 hours as follows: widening of A-V O2 content difference was more pronounced (28 +/- 6 vs 15 +/- 6 ml/L, p less than 0.03) and the increment in tissue O2 extraction was larger (14 +/- 3 vs 8 +/- 3 percent, p less than 0.03). P50 and related variables did not change during the course of the study. Thus, like normal subjects, hypoxemic patients stimulated with phosphate administration can exercise perhaps more efficiently; but, in contrast to normal subjects, this effect cannot be attributed to changes in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity. These data suggest that phosphate administration may be beneficial in hypoxemic states where adequate tissue oxygenation cannot be achieved by other more conventional methods. The mechanism of this effect remains to be elucidated.\r"

Rrs was measured at frequencies between 6 (R6) and 26 Hz (R26). (R6-R26)/R26 was used as an index of frequency dependency of Rrs. A positive histamine test was defined as PC20 less than 8 mg/ml. Seventeen subjects had a positive test, and all of these had increases from baseline of R6 greater than 50 percent and (R6-R26)/R26 greater than 0.45. Of the 14 subjects whose PC20 was greater than 8 mg/ml, only two had changes in R6 and (R6-R26)/R26 of this magnitude. These two subjects had changes in FEV1 of 16 and 18 percent. There was a strong linear relationship between the changes in FEV1 and both R6 and (R6-R26)/R26 from baseline to the final value at the end of the test (r = 0.87 and 0.91 respectively). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the evaluation of airway reactivity by histamine challenge may be done by forced oscillation technique. It is easy to administer and may allow testing of children unable to perform spirometry.\r"

Tape play-back auscultation of recorded tracheal and lung sounds was performed by ten observers in each group of residents, nurses, staff physicians and physiotherapists. They repeated the test after two weeks to three months. Individual descriptions were compared to computer-aided characterization of the breath sound recordings. We found significant differences in the preferred terms for description of adventitious lung sounds between the groups of health care professionals. There was considerable intraobserver variability, with less agreement when suggestions for a more complex characterization were followed. Our observations indicate the importance of teaching a standardized nomenclature for lung sounds to health care professionals, using only terms which are clearly informative of pulmonary disease.\r"

Inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes appearing with the presence of brown pigment gallstones and inflammation in biliary tract was shown to effect deconjugation of bilirubin conjugates in bile and contribute to their formation in addition to that of bacterial beta-glucuronidase. Gallbladder bile (mean +/- SD, 4.0 +/- 1.6%, N = 29) contained more unconjugated bilirubin than hepatic bile (mean +/- SD, 2.7 +/- 1.1%). In vitro experiments showed the deconjugation to take place during incubation at 37 degrees C without the presence of bacteria. Therefore, transformation of conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin is likely to take place in vivo during the storage in gallbladder, and nonbacterial beta-glucuronidase activity and/or nonenzymatic hydrolysis may be responsible for such transformation.\r"

The value of the tests for screening in the general population was assessed by simulation, using estimates of disease prevalence. TSBA was significantly more sensitive (78%) but less specific (94%) than CCA (sensitivity of 69%, specificity of 98%). Aspartate aminotransferase was nearly as sensitive (74%) as TSBA, but significantly less specific (93%) than CCA. CCA provided the highest positive predictivity (98%), even in a screening simulation (32%). With the use of sequential aspartate aminotransferase measurement followed by CCA, this value rose to 100%. This test procedure appears to be the best screening method for liver diseases available at present.\r"

The slow wave frequency in patients with diverticular disease was similar to that in healthy subjects. The peak frequency measured with SWSA was uniformly higher than that measured with FFT. Secoverine, a muscarinic antagonist, did not affect the slow wave frequency. Eating a 1000-kcal meal initiates an increase in colonic spike activity (22 +/- 2 spike potential/30 min) (P less than 0.001) in healthy subjects during the immediate postprandial period. The gastrocolonic response in patients with diverticular disease was prolonged for 60 min. Secoverine inhibited the gastrocolonic response in patients with diverticular disease. These studies suggest patients with diverticular disease have a similar slow wave frequency as healthy subjects, the gastrocolonic response is prolonged in patients with diverticular disease, and secoverine inhibits the colonic response.\r"

Subjects most commonly defined constipation as straining and hard stools and diarrhea as loose/watery stools and urgency. Investigators should use race- and sex-specific norms to study individuals who have patterns which deviate from the usual. Investigators and clinicians must also consider definitions used by their subjects.\r"

Ulcer healing was assessed endoscopically after two and four weeks of treatment. The mean age, sex distribution, and tobacco and alcohol consumption were similar in the two treatment groups. The ulcers of 16 patients in both the placebo and the arbacet-treated group healed after 14 days of treatment. At the end of the study, healing of the ulcer was observed in 69.2% of the arbacet-treated patients and in 60.4% of patients in the placebo treated group.

  ".W": "The property of the pancreatic ductal system that restricts free ionic diffusion has been termed the \"pancreatic duct mucosal barrier,\" damage to which may be important in the pathogenesis of acute gallstone pancreatitis. The bile-pancreatic duct of the rat (BPD) was perfused in situ with a standard ionic solution. The normal duct was permeable to both chloride and bicarbonate ions, and flux (JCl-, JHCO3-) appeared to occur by passive ionic diffusion. Measurement of absolute ionic flux and transductal potential difference (PD) gave control values of JCl-, +0.92 +/- 0.15 mumol/cm/hr; JHCO3-, -1.71 +/- 0.12 mumol/cm/hr; PD -2.3 +/- 0.20 mV. The preparation was stable over the experimental period, and the results obtained were reproducible between animals. Glycodeoxycholate compromised the integrity of the BPD with an increase in ionic flux and a reduction in PD with corresponding alterations in mucosal ultrastructure. Increasing concentrations of bile salt produced more severe damage to the BPD. The BPD of the rat is therefore analogous to the pancreatic duct of the cat in possessing a mucosal barrier, and the barrier is damaged by bile salts. This preparation may be useful for studying pancreatic duct integrity, a concept of importance in the pathogenesis of acute gallstone pancreatitis.\r"

Rats were injected subcutaneously every 8 hr with cerulein, 12 micrograms/kg, for two days. They were sacrificed 2 and 4 hr after the first injection, 4 hr after the second and third, and 8 hr after the sixth. By 2 hr after the first injection, carbamylcholine showed decreased potency for stimulating amylase release; decreased potency becomes maximal after the second injection. Four hours after the first injection, carbamylcholine also showed decreased efficacy for causing maximal amylase release. In the course of development of pancreatitis, progressive reductions in muscarinic receptor concentrations were evident from 4 hr after the second injection. Following the complete treatment (8 hr after the sixth injection), no alteration could be observed in the affinity or proportions of each agonist class of muscarinic receptors. These studies indicate that the pancreatic acinar cells still remain functional after acute cerulein-induced pancreatitis, although significant reductions in potency and efficacy of carbamylcholine to cause amylase release and reduced muscarinic receptor concentration occur.\r"

  ".W": "A 72-year old man developed jaundice while on fusidic acid therapy for suspected osteomyelitis. Hyperbilirubinemia was predominantly of the conjugated variety and elevation in liver enzymes was mild and transient. Although serum bilirubin fell rapidly after fusidic acid was stopped, complete resolution of the hyperbilirubinemia took nearly a month. Other possible causes of jaundice were excluded. Light microscopy of a needle liver biopsy showed focal hepatocyte feathery degeneration, intracellular bile retention, and canalicular bile plugging, most prominent in perivenous regions. Electron microscopy revealed varying degrees of canalicular dilatation, loss of microvilli, and disruption of the canalicular membrane with vesicular bleb formation as well as canalicular bile plugs. Widening of the pericanalicular ectoplasmic zone with accumulation of cytoskeletal filaments was also noted. These findings are similar to those reported in experimental cholestasis induced by bile acids. Possible mechanisms of jaundice caused by fusidic acid are discussed.\r"

Replacement of dietary long-chain fats with medium-chain triglycerides, pancreatic enzyme supplements, and a short course of oxytetracycline, resulted in dramatic clinical improvement. The possibility of intestinal lymphangiectasia should be borne in mind in patients with postradiotherapy malabsorption. A low serum albumin and lymphocyte count should draw attention to this possibility.\r"

To calibrate the spirometer and determine its accuracy, six healthy volunteers were trained in its use by the pharmacist. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were determined for each volunteer once a month for six months. The T test for the presence of outliers showed no statistical difference at p less than 0.05. Seven patients on chronic therapy with theophylline derivatives for respiratory problems were randomly referred by their physicians to the pharmacokinetic service. The pharmacist counseled each patient and measured FVC and FEV1 once a month for six months. The ratio, (FEV1:FVC) X 100, was calculated for each patient before and after steady-state serum level determination and dosage adjustment. The mean value for this ratio was 45.1 before pharmacokinetic intervention and 57.5 after intervention. Using the Student's t-test, these results were significant (p less than 0.05). The correlation coefficient was calculated to determine if a correlation existed between the increase in the ratio and the increase in serum theophylline levels. Serum levels were ordered before and after intervention for five of the seven patients receiving pharmacokinetic intervention. The change in serum levels vs. change in the ratio was associated with a correlation coefficient of 0.718. Monitoring pulmonary function may be a useful adjunct for the pharmacist who provides pharmacokinetic counseling to patients with respiratory disease, but expanded studies are needed to judge the value of routine spirometric measurements on homebased patients.\r"

Classic drug eruptions are quite uncommon with tricyclic antidepressants. Tartrazine, a common additive in the food and drug industry, is implicated in a number of hypersensitivity reactions.

A 36-year-old black female with BP of 270/160 mm Hg with complaints greater than one month's duration of dizziness, severe headaches, blurred vision, shortness of breath, vomiting, palpitations, flushing, agitation, diarrhea, weakness, and weight loss, was treated successfully with intravenous labetalol after she failed to respond to other established parenteral antihypertensive drugs. The patient received labetalol 20 mg iv bolus, and then 20 mg every ten minutes until a cumulative dose of 200 mg was attained. Labetalol produced a prompt but smooth reduction in BP without any reflex tachycardia or other adverse effects. Intravenous labetalol may be safe and effective for the management of rapid BP control in hypertensive emergencies resistant to other parenteral antihypertensive agents.\r"

Conflicting reports exist concerning the in vivo effect of ketoconazole on concomitantly administered drugs that require these metabolic processes for clearance. Therefore, the effect of multiple-dose ketoconazole on the elimination of theophylline, a drug metabolized by cytochrome P-450, in ten healthy, nonsmoking males (aged 18-40 years) was evaluated. Each subject received aminophylline 6 mg/kg iv before and at the end of seven days of ketoconazole 200 mg/d po. Theophylline serum concentrations were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (TDx) at 12 time points over the 24-hour period following each infusion. No statistical difference (two-tailed t-test) in half-life (mean +/- SD 7.8 +/- 1.8 vs. 8.2 +/- 1.9 h) or clearance (0.797 +/- 0.201 vs. 0.722 +/- 0.133 ml/min/kg) could be demonstrated for theophylline before or after ketoconazole administration. Theophylline dosage adjustment is probably not necessary for concomitant theophylline and ketoconazole drug therapy.\r"

In order to comply with health department regulations requiring the use of protocols by non-physician practitioners, and to better define the pharmacist's role, pharmacy protocols for the treatment of essential hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus have been developed. The protocols provide specific guidelines for the pharmacist involved in primary patient care. In addition, they describe a procedure for the selection and referral of patients. These protocols can serve as a sound foundation by which other pharmacists involved with primary patient care treat essential hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. They can easily be modified to suit a pharmacist's particular needs and situation.\r"

The most commonly prescribed medications in this population were hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene (13.5 percent), digoxin (9.6 percent), and hydrochlorothiazide (8.4 percent). There was a large increase in the use of nutritional supplements in the past five years, with 18.0 percent of these subjects reporting the use of vitamin E and 15.7 percent taking vitamin C.

In the present study, tobramycin Cl is determined by both serum concentration data and direct renal clearance (Clren). Tobramycin Clren appeared to be directly correlated to the measured creatinine clearance (Clcr) (r = 0.93, p less than 0.01). The tobramycin Cl, by both methods of determination, was not elevated in comparison to the Clcr or expected values for patients without the disease. These results appear to corroborate a recent study in which the renal and plasma Cl of gentamicin was measured in patients with mild-to-moderate CF and were not noted to be elevated. It is suggested that standard doses of tobramycin be used initially in patients with mild-to-moderate CF with dosage adjustment based on serum concentration data to achieve the desired goals.\r"

Unfortunately, measures that are successful in one institution may not be effective or appropriate in another. A three-year study was undertaken to examine the impact on physician prescribing of an infection control bulletin and formalized recommendation for antibiotic utilization. Patient records also were examined to determine if any change in antibiotic utilization would influence patient morbidity. Over the three examination periods there was a significant reduction in cost of prophylaxis in 7 surgical groups, and a trend toward cost reduction in 21 additional groups. Cost of prophylaxis also increased in other surgical groups. Cost reduction was associated with limited duration of prophylaxis and a shift toward use of first generation cephalosporin products. Patient morbidity did not differ significantly.\r"

In October 1982, many antacids, cough and cold preparations, antihistamines, and mild analgesics were removed from the GMS prescribing list. The visiting rate and the amount of prescribing fell in the GMS during 1982-83. Drug utilization within the GMS was measured using prescription numbers and in the total population using data obtained from pharmaceutical wholesalers expressed as defined daily doses. These results showed substantial changes in GMS prescribing in the utilization of mefenamic acid, carbocysteine, and H2-receptor antagonists associated with the introduction of the limited list, suggesting a switch to these agents from delisted preparations. The therapeutic and economic implications of this policy are discussed.\r"

As measured by the uptake of 3H-thymidine (mean [+/- standard error]), response to the T-cell mitogen phytohemagglutin (PHA) was significantly higher (P less than 0.002) in cells of DES-exposed women (88.6 +/- 5.7 X 10(3) cpm) than in controls (44.0 +/- 8.9 X 10(3) cpm) at the lowest dose of mitogen tested (0.125 microgram/ml). Moreover, lymphocytes of DES-exposed subjects showed maximal blastogenic response to PHA at a concentration (0.125 microgram/ml) two to four times lower (P less than 0.002) than controls (0.25 microgram/ml to 0.5 microgram/ml). Cells of both DES-exposed subjects and controls were maximally responsive to pokeweed mitogen (PWM) at the lowest dose tested (0.625 microgram/ml). These findings suggest that in utero DES exposure is associated with a hyper-reactive immune response during the reproductive years.\r"

Each woman received bromocriptine mesylate (BRC) 1.25 mg (1/2 tablet)/day for 2 weeks, at which time a repeat PRL level was obtained. If needed, the dose was increased in a stepwise fashion until the PRL level was in the normal range. Results show that 12 of 15 patients with an initial PRL greater than 20 but less than 50 ng/ml required 2.5 mg or less of BRC daily. Of 9 patients with a PRL greater than 50 but less than 100 ng/ml, 5 required 2.5 mg daily with the remaining 4 needing 5.0 mg. Five of 7 patients with a PRL greater than 100 ng/ml required 5.0 mg or more, while one responded to 1.25 mg. These findings confirm that a lower than manufacturer-recommended dose of BRC is usually effective in normalizing PRL levels, especially when the initial PRL is less than 100 ng/ml.\r"

In both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, melatonin increased 2 to 3 hours after the evening increase in PRL and 4 hours before the nocturnal rise in PRL concentrations. Oral administration of melatonin stimulated PRL release. The PRL response varied with menstrual cycle stage being significantly greater in the ovulatory (P less than 0.001) and luteal (P less than 0.01) phases than in the follicular phase. The results suggest that melatonin may be involved in control of the nocturnal PRL increase.\r"

The response of plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone (T), and androstenedione (delta 4A), all indicators of adrenal C19-steroid production, varied greatly among individuals. Sixteen women with idiopathic hirsutism were given night-time dexamethasone (DEX) and then superimposed spironolactone for 4 weeks, followed by DEX without spironolactone for an additional 4 weeks. As expected, DHEAS, T, and delta 4A declined on DEX treatment. On addition of spironolactone, there was little further change in DHEAS, while plasma T declined in 7 of 16 women, including all those whose T level had remained elevated despite DEX treatment; most values rebounded when spironolactone was discontinued. The authors conclude from intact DEX-suppressed women that ovarian T, especially when increased, is frequently lowered by spironolactone. Thus, both adrenal and ovarian androgen production (as measured by prevailing plasma levels) may be diminished by this agent. These highly variable effects on androgen production are unlikely to account for the consistent antiandrogenic effects reported clinically.\r"

G-L cell cultures from follicles that contained an oocyte that fertilized in vitro produced significantly more progesterone over 3 and 6 days of culture than those obtained from follicles in which the oocyte did not fertilize. Furthermore, LH/hCG receptor content after 6 days was significantly higher in G-L cells obtained from follicles with fertilized oocytes compared with follicles with unfertilized oocytes.

Positive fluorescence indicates that the serum contains antibodies to sperm antigens that were transferred to the surface of an oocyte during gamete fusion. Complement-mediated lysis indicates that the immunoglobulin that is bound can also fix complement. The advantages of this assay for detection of serum antisperm antibodies are that it is an extension of a widely used assay, is rapid and requires readily available reagents and equipment, can detect most subclasses of IgA, IgG, and IgM, detects antibodies to those sperm antigens that may be transferred to the oocyte during fertilization, and indicates whether the detected antisperm antibodies can mediate complement-dependent lysis of the fertilized oocyte.\r"

With 19 embryos at the 2-cell stage, the authors obtained 100% morphologic survival and 89% development to hatching blastocyst stage. To define the optimal conditions for vitrification of ova, the authors treated a total of 845 unfertilized ova. In experiments done at 0 degree C, the concentration of vitrification solution (VS1) and the length of exposure of ova to VS1 both had significant (P less than 0.01) effects on survival. The mean survival rate for controls in ten experiments was 52%. VS1 100% or 90% in HEPES buffered saline and 10 minutes' exposure yielded rates that did not differ significantly from controls. Significantly lower survival rates followed the use of 70 and 80% solution and exposure for 5, 15, 20, or 30 minutes. Thus, under these conditions, exposure of unfertilized mouse ova to VS1 and cooling to 0 degree C did not interfere with in vitro fertilization and development of embryos. However, in five experiments in which a total of 101 ova were plunged into liquid nitrogen after treatment with VS1 under the optimal conditions, none could be fertilized in vitro.\r"

Significantly higher concentrations of Na, K, and urea were found in SVB as compared with PB values (P less than 0.001 for all) of patients with varicocele, but not in control subjects. The SVB concentrations of Na, K, and urea in varicocele patients were higher than SVB and PB concentrations of the control group (P less than 0.001 for all). It is concluded that urea, Na, and K concentrations are raised in SVB of patients with varicocele; this imbalance may be related, among other factors, to the pathogenesis of dyspermia in varicocele.\r"

To determine if ascorbic acid or its oxidized form can inhibit tissue uptake of glucose, the brain uptake index (BUI) and muscle uptake index of glucose were determined by single arterial injection tissue-sampling technique. The injectate was either buffered Ringer's solution with varying concentrations of ascorbate, dehydroascorbate (pH 7.4), or 70% serum from individuals on vitamin C supplements. Ascorbic acid over a wide range of concentrations (0-10,000 mg/L) did not reduce the BUI. Ascorbic acid reduced BUI from the control value of 33 +/- 3.2 to 20.1 +/- 2.2% (P less than .01) only at 100,000 mg/L; this effect was probably secondary to osmotic disruption of blood-brain barrier. In contrast, dehydroascorbate inhibited the BUI of glucose from baseline value of 32.8 +/- 1.1 to 10.7 +/- 0.67%, with an estimated Ki of 13.0 mM. Masseter muscle glucose uptake was not significantly altered over a wide range of ascorbate or dehydroascorbate concentrations in the injectate. Dehydroascorbate (7500 mg/L) did not significantly reduce the BUI of [14C]phenylalanine (55.2 +/- 4.4 vs. 62.1 +/- 4.2% in controls). When serum from six individuals on calcium ascorbate (3-5 g/day) was compared with that of nine controls, the BUI was not different (19.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 19.3 +/- 1.1%). Similarly, supplementing the diet of eight healthy volunteers with 1 g calcium ascorbate for 8 days did not alter the BUI of glucose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ability of red blood cells (RBCs) to undergo an adaptation in shape that permits passage through the smallest vessels is reportedly impaired in diabetes. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain decreased erythrocyte deformability, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of microvascular complications, but the mechanisms responsible for this change have not been clearly delineated. In view of the fact that sorbitol accumulates in RBCs in diabetes and the postulate that increased sorbitol could alter deformability properties, we examined the influence of the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil on erythrocyte deformability. Erythrocyte deformability, determined as the volume of RBCs (VRBC) filtered per minute through 4.7-micron pore size filters, was significantly reduced in samples from diabetic rats compared with samples from controls (0.76 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.97 +/- .02 ml RBC/min; P less than .001). In contrast, deformability of RBCs from diabetic animals treated with sorbinil was significantly greater than in untreated diabetes, although not completely normalized (0.88 +/- 0.02; P less than .01 vs. diabetic, and P less than .02 vs. control). The reduced deformability characterizing cells from diabetic rats and its partial prevention by sorbinil persisted even when RBCs were washed to eliminate hyperglycemia and hyperviscous plasma. Thus, hyperviscosity per se is not responsible for the decreased deformability, and sorbinil can partially prevent this change despite persistent hyperglycemia. This effect may derive from sorbinil's action as an aldose reductase inhibitor and/or its ability to influence physicochemical properties of the erythrocyte membrane.\r"

In general, it is agreed that tSIP greater than tTRUE greater than tWIL, but estimates of tTRUE beyond this have not been made. In this study, a collapsed-ellipse method for approximating tTRUE is presented that measures thickness by areas (tEA). One hundred-twenty capillaries from the forearm skin of 12 diabetic subjects and 12 age-matched controls were measured to examine these concepts. We found that, whereas tWIL was up to 63% below tTRUE, tEA was less than 30% too low. Although tSIP, tWIL, and tEA did not distinguish between diabetic and normal subjects, tEA and tWIL measurements had highly predictable and small errors, and tSIP had unpredictable ranges of error, especially when tSIP was low.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that glucose may directly regulate its rate of utilization in skeletal muscle was investigated in vitro with the rat soleus muscle. Preincubation of the muscles with varying glucose concentrations modulated the rate of glucose utilization through the glycolytic pathway during a subsequent incubation. At glucose concentrations below approximately 3.0 mM, utilization was maximal (26.8 +/- 2.4 and 87.5 +/- 4.8 nmol X g-1 X min-1 when assayed in the presence of 0.5 and 5.0 mM glucose, respectively). Preincubation with higher glucose concentrations (up to 20 mM) reduced the utilization by 40-60% in a biphasic manner: a rapid fall between 1 and 4 mM, followed by a gradual approximately 2% decrease per each millimolar increase of glucose. The effect of preexposure to glucose was not due to substrate dilution by the remaining glucose in the extracellular or intracellular space of the muscle. The uptake of the nonmetabolizable glucose analogues 3-O-methylglucose and 2-deoxyglucose was also modulated by extracellular glucose in a similar manner. Thus, the regulatory site seems to reside in the transport function of the hexose. The ATP content was very similar in muscles preexposed to 1.0 and 15.0 mM glucose for 3 h and therefore does not seem to be the mediator of the glucose effect. This substrate regulation of the rate of glucose transport and of the glycolytic flux may be operative in the in vivo glucose homeostatic system and may contribute to the reduced peripheral glucose utilization observed in diabetes.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether an increase in blood concentration patterns of ketone bodies and lactic acid, organic acids often elevated in poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), could contribute to increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) regardless of changes in circulating levels of glucose and insulin. Six IDDM patients and six normal subjects were given a saline infusion (15 mumol.min-1.kg-1) for 2 h, an acetoacetic acid infusion (15 mumol.min-1.kg-1) for another 2 h, and then a saline infusion after an overnight fast during euglycemic insulin-glucose clamp. Acetoacetic acid infusion resulted in an increase of blood ketone bodies in the range of 0.7-1.5 mM from a basal value of 0.1-0.3 mM. GFR was 125 +/- 16 and 136 +/- 17 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2 in normal and IDDM subjects, respectively, during baseline saline infusion and 138 +/- 21 (P less than .01 vs. basal level) and 158 +/- 15 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2 (P less than .001 vs. basal level) during acetoacetic acid infusion. During the last saline infusion, renal hemodynamic patterns decreased again to baseline levels. Another six IDDM patients and six normal subjects were given saline, lactic acid, and saline infusions at the same rates of infusion after an overnight fast during euglycemic insulin-glucose clamp.

This is the first report indicating that nerve ATPase activities measured in vitro showed no deficit in mice with spontaneous diabetes. Thus, diabetic neuropathy in the genetically diabetic mouse may occur in the absence of Na+-K+-ATPase abnormalities, which were previously described in association with polyol pathway impairment in experimental diabetic and BB Wistar rats. Control and diabetic groups treated with ganglioside mixture for 30 days before death presented statistically insignificant differences. Therefore, the beneficial effect of gangliosides described in C57Bl/Ks (db/db) mice on electrophysiological and morphometrical parameters must be due to different pharmacological activities rather than to prevention of the decay or better maintenance of ATPase activity.\r"

The 'Rand health insurance study battery', the 'sickness impact profile' and the 'general health questionnaire' were tested in two general practices in Sydney, Australia, to determine patient compliance, to assess the range of scores and discriminative ability of the instruments, and to compare the different instruments. There was a high degree of acceptance of the questionnaires, showing that patients visiting their general practitioners are prepared to complete such questionnaires. The range of scores obtained was less skewed for the Rand measures than for the sickness impact profile or the general health questionnaire, suggesting that the Rand measures should be the preferred general health status measure.\r"

While doctors agreed on the importance of books and journals and on the unimportance of patients, nurses and other paramedicals, there was a major disagreement about the importance of drug company representatives: this source of information about new drugs was rated high in Sweden and Yugoslavia and low in Britain and Belgium. Doctors also differed in their estimation of patients' expectations of how they would prescribe and how they responded to the clinical problems. The differences, which might be due to differences in education about therapeutics or to cultural differences between countries, are important because of the high cost of drugs bills in all countries.\r"

All ancillary staff were employed by the practitioner and the mean number of staff was 3.1. Multifactor comparison was undertaken. More staff were employed by practitioners who were under 45 years old, who lived within five miles of a hospital, and who had in-patient facilities. Questions are posed concerning the development of team care in Sri Lanka.\r"

Presentations from or about developing countries were analysed in an attempt to compare the external resources with those in industrial countries, and to find out how primary care physicians in the developing countries see themselves, their work and the health care system. Solo works were presented equally often from authors in industrial and developing countries, but groups from industrial countries were more often multidisciplinary and larger. Most studies from developing countries were done in urban surroundings. Half of the presentations studied material from primary health care, while 44% were oriented more narrowly toward medical care. Most of the techniques described were suitable for primary care. Teamwork and intersectoral collaboration were discussed in half of the studies coming from primary health care, while traditional medicine was mentioned only occasionally.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of infestation with the head louse, Pediculus capitis, was assessed among the child population, from birth to 10 years old inclusive, of the rapidly expanding Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah. Over a period of two months, 300 consecutive children attending the general practitioner for any reason were examined specifically to identify those infested with head lice: 37 cases of active infestation were found, which is an overall prevalence of 12%. An interesting distribution, however, was noted in respect of age, ranging from less than 2% in the first year of life, rising rapidly to around 30% in ages six to eight years, thereafter declining steadily to about 16% by age 10 years. The distribution of infestation among males and females was broadly similar. These results show a high head lice infestation, particularly in the early school years, where presumably interpersonal contacts are most frequent, facilitating contagious spread. As the head lice is known to spread several viral and rickettsial diseases, such as relapsing fever and typhus, greater efforts should be made towards patient education in hygiene, and towards identifying and treating the disease when found.\r"

Tissue conductance was lower in proximal colon, but there were no other regional differences in basal electrophysiologic parameters. There was a gradient of amiloride-sensitive electrogenic Na transport. Whereas amiloride had only a minimal effect in proximal colon, it inhibited 70% of short-circuit current and 50% of net Na absorption in distal colon. Ion substitution experiments demonstrated an electroneutral, coupled Na-Cl cotransport system in proximal and distal colon. Neither amphotericin nor impermeant anions had a consistent stimulatory effect on short-circuit current in human colon. Theophylline (10(-3) M), increased short-circuit current by 4 microEq X cm-2 X h-1, stimulated net Cl secretion, but did not block net Na absorption. Epinephrine, via an alpha 2-adrenergic mechanism, significantly decreased short-circuit current but did not alter Na or Cl transport. These results suggest that all segments of human colon actively absorb Na and Cl, Na absorption occurs by both electrogenic Na absorption and electroneutral Na-Cl cotransport, there is an aboral gradient of increasing electrogenic Na transport, theophylline stimulates secretion in a pattern most consistent with electrogenic Cl secretion, and epinephrine does not increase Na-Cl cotransport in human distal colon. These studies demonstrate that human colon in vitro has distinct transport properties that must be considered both in clinical situations and in comparison to animal models.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation was designed to establish the mechanism of sodium and chloride transport in the rat distal colon by determining ion fluxes across isolated mucosa under voltage clamp conditions. The net rates of sodium and chloride absorption in the distal colon of the rat were approximately equal (5.8 +/- 0.3 and 6.9 +/- 0.5 microEq/h X cm2, respectively) and significantly greater than the short circuit current (0.9 +/- 0.1 microEq/h X cm2). Net sodium absorption and net chloride absorption were markedly reduced by the removal of chloride and sodium, respectively, but were not affected by the absence of potassium from the mucosal bathing solution. Both net sodium absorption and net chloride absorption were also significantly inhibited by 1.0 mM amiloride and by 0.1 mM acetazolamide. In contrast, 0.1 mM amiloride and 1.0 mM furosemide did not inhibit either sodium or chloride absorption. These results confirm that electroneutral sodium chloride absorption is the predominant mechanism of sodium and chloride absorption and suggest that parallel ion (Na-H and Cl-HCO3) exchanges, rather than independent electrogenic sodium and chloride transport, coupled sodium-chloride cotransport, or coupled Na-K-2Cl cotransport, are most likely responsible for sodium chloride absorption in this epithelium.\r"

Sucrose (500 mmol/kg) significantly decreased apical membrane resistances (Ra, from 5501 +/- 841 to 3789 +/- 597 omega X cm2, p less than 0.01), and basolateral membrane resistances (Rb, from 3805 +/- 646 to 2594 +/- 429 omega X cm2, p less than 0.05). The paracellular pathway resistance (Rs) increased significantly from 720 +/- 57 to 822 +/- 71 omega X cm2 (p less than 0.001). Urea (500 mmol/kg) more markedly diminished the apical and basolateral resistances (Ra, from 4303 +/- 663 to 1914 +/- 286 omega X cm2, p less than 0.001; and Rb, from 2600 +/- 474 to 1034 +/- 213, p less than 0.001). In contrast to sucrose, urea-containing solutions significantly decreased Rs (from 682 +/- 78 to 398 +/- 57 omega X cm2, p less than 0.001). Electron micrographs revealed dilatation of lateral intercellular spaces and disruption of desmosomes in tissues exposed to urea, but no visible alterations in tissues exposed to solutions containing sucrose. The resistance of the cellular pathway to ion permeation was thus diminished during exposure to both solutes. In contrast, changes in resistance of the paracellular pathway appeared to depend on the effects of each solute on dimensions and structures of the intercellular pathways.\r"

  ".W": "In recent hypotheses concerning the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is claimed to be produced by the colonic flora, although enzymes necessary to generate GABA have been reported to be present in intestinal mucosa. In this study, using normal and germ-free Wistar rats, we determined GABA levels and amino-grams of arterial blood and of venous effluent from small and large bowel. The data indicate that large and small intestinal mucosa significantly contribute to GABA production. In the fasted state GABA concentrations are greater in the venous effluent of the small bowel than in the venous effluent of the large bowel. Feeding increases the arterioportal differences, and uptake in the small bowel is still significantly higher than in the large bowel. This process is not, or can only be to a minor degree, bacterially mediated, because GABA production in the gut both in the fed and fasted state is of similar magnitude in germ-free and normal animals. gamma-Aminobutyric acid release correlates significantly with glutamine uptake in the small bowel of fasted rats. Only a small fraction of the glutamine taken up is needed to account for GABA release, so that conclusions concerning which amino acids may serve as precursors of GABA cannot be drawn. Further studies are needed to delineate the metabolic pathways leading to GABA synthesis.\r"

Using an 111In-leukocyte technique in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 90) and osteoarthritis (n = 7), it appears that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs cause small intestinal inflammation in two-thirds of patients on long-term treatment and on discontinuation, the inflammation may persist for up to 16 mo. The prevalence and magnitude of the intestinal inflammation was unrelated to the type and dose of nonsteroidal drugs and previous or concomitant second-line drug treatment. There was a significant inverse correlation (r = -0.29, p less than 0.05) between fecal 111In excretion and hemoglobin levels in patients treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The kinetics of fecal indium 111 excretion in patients treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was almost identical to that of patients with small bowel Crohn's disease. Eighteen patients on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs underwent a radiologic examination of the small bowel and 3 were found to have asymptomatic ileal disease with ulceration and strictures. Nineteen patients on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, 20 healthy controls, and 13 patients with Crohn's ileitis underwent a dual radioisotopic ileal function test with tauro 23 (75Se) selena-25-homocholic acid and cobalt 58-labeled cyanocobalamine. On day 4, more than half of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis had evidence of bile acid malabsorption, but the ileal dysfunction was much milder than seen in patients with Crohn's ileitis.\r"

In one of two kindreds with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, no affected individuals had jaw lesions. In the other, the 1 affected patient with dental radiographs had generalized jaw lesions. Twelve children less than 16 yr old at risk for adenomatous polyposis were observed. Seven children with jaw lesions developed polyps after a mean interval of 4 yr. Five children without jaw lesions were polyp-free during a 5-10-yr follow-up. Thus, occult jaw lesions are consistently found only in some families with adenomatous polyposis coli, providing support for heterogeneity in polyposis syndromes. Jaw lesions are good predictors for polyp development in kindreds with adenomatous polyposis coli and jaw lesions. Their role as markers in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer needs exploration.\r"

The onset of ascites (as an index of sodium retention) in cirrhotic rats was estimated by sequential paracentesis. Thirteen cirrhotic animals developed an impairment of water excretion 2-5 wk after the onset of ascites. The urinary excretion of antidiuretic hormone in these animals, which was normal before the impairment of water excretion, increased markedly within the week in which this abnormality was first detected and remained high thereafter. The remaining 5 cirrhotic rats did not experience an impairment of free water excretion in spite of developing ascites. The urinary excretion of antidiuretic hormone in these animals was similar to that of control rats during the entire study. In all urine samples obtained from cirrhotic rats, there was a highly significant direct linear correlation between the urinary excretion of antidiuretic hormone and the minimum urinary osmolality. Our results show the following: in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis, sodium retention preceded the impairment of water excretion; and in these animals, the defect in water metabolism correlated chronologically and quantitatively with antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion. These findings are consistent with the concept that antidiuretic hormone is a major determinant of the impaired water metabolism in cirrhosis.\r"

Electrical transmural stimulation of the isolated cat colon led to an increase in the Ca2+-dependent, tetrodotoxin-sensitive release of endogenous GABA. gamma-Aminobutyric acid increased the amplitude of rhythmic contractions of the circular muscle of the colon and also the release of acetylcholine, which was Ca2+-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive. Scopolamine inhibited the GABA-evoked rhythmic contractions, without effect on the evoked release of acetylcholine. Bicuculline and furosemide reduced the amplitude of spontaneous rhythmic contractions and the tone, which was reversed by GABA. These results suggest that GABA-containing neurons are involved in the control of motility of the cat colon, due to the stimulation of cholinergic neurons.\r"

The effect of acute emotional stress on resting upper esophageal sphincter pressure was evaluated in 13 normal subjects with a manometric sleeve assembly. Manometric sideholes were positioned in the pharynx and cervical and thoracic esophagus while the sleeve sensor straddled the upper esophageal sphincter. Subjects were stressed intermittently by 14-min periods of a dichotic listening task. As incentive, a financial reward was offered and made commensurate with performance. Alterations of heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance confirmed the effectiveness of the stressor. The overall mean upper esophageal sphincter pressure during control periods was 46.5 mmHg (SEM = 4.7). During stress there was a significant mean increase (11.8 +/- 2.9 mmHg; p = 0.002) in upper esophageal sphincter pressure from control levels, and the pressure increase during the first 2-min epoch of stress was 20.8 +/- 3.9 mmHg (p = 0.0003). Emotional stress causes significant elevation of upper esophageal pressure in normal subjects. This effect is likely to influence resting sphincter pressure measurements, particularly if measurement conditions are stressful to the subject.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the role of biliary permeability in estrogen-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, long-term experiments were performed in rats using estradiol 17 beta-valerate. Bile flow, secretion of taurocholate, biliary clearance of [14C]sucrose and [14C]inulin, and phosphate concentration in bile were determined in hemoglobin-free perfused livers excised from male rats pretreated for different time periods. Basal and taurocholate-stimulated bile flow were already reduced during the first 7-10 days of treatment and remained at the lower level for more than 12 wk. In contrast, the concentration of taurocholate in bile was elevated at 7 and 10 days but was lower than in controls after 3 wk. An increase in [14C]sucrose clearance after 3 wk indicated a moderate increase in the permeability of a paracellular pathway. The concentration of phosphate in bile was also increased after 3 wk. Detailed analysis of biliary sucrose and inulin clearances revealed that the diffusion permeability coefficient (k = 0.14) did not increase during the first 10 days of treatment but did increase to greater than 0.4 after 3 wk of treating rats with estradiol 17 beta-valerate. From the temporal sequence of the cholestatic responses it is concluded that the altered permeability of the biliary tree is not the primary event but occurs subsequent to the cholestasis induced by estrogens.\r"

Power settings of 0.5-2.0 W and exposures of 50-2400 s produced well-defined, highly reproducible necrotic lesions of up to 16 mm in diameter. The diameter of the necrotic lesions depended upon both the power setting and total energy delivered. Histologic examination showed coagulative necrosis that healed by granulation with a small residual fibrous nodule by 60 days. Microthermocouples embedded within the liver indicated temperatures of up to 100 degrees C close to the fiber tip for the higher power settings, and temperatures at the periphery of the necrotic zones were consistent with tissue damage by a purely thermal effect. Radiologic examination of photocoagulated lobes of liver in which arterial tree had been filled with a radiopaque polymer demonstrated loss of all small and some large vessels in the treated area. The technique could be used to induce necrosis of intrahepatic and other tumors.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical and biochemical evolution of hepatic lesions in 124 patients with toxic oil syndrome from 1981 to 1986 has been reviewed. Most patients became asymptomatic during the early phase of the disease and abnormal liver function tests gradually normalized. In 1981, liver injury resembled drug-induced cholestatic hepatitis in 31 patients, and in 1 patient chronic destructive nonsuppurative cholangitis was evident. From 1982 to 1986 serial liver biopsies demonstrated toxic cholestatic hepatitis in 14 patients, chronic active hepatitis in 13, and nonalcoholic cirrhosis in 4. Nineteen patients showed lesions suggestive of alcoholic liver disease, but only 8 had a history of heavy alcohol intake. One patient developed biliary cirrhosis, another liver cell adenoma, and 8 nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. We conclude that although liver injury had subsided in most patients, a significant number developed a variety of different liver diseases after follow-up for 5 yr.\r"

The clinico-pathological features in these 5 patients and in 26 well-documented previously reported cases could be ascribed to three groups of increasing severity: thrombosis limited to small-sized hepatic veins with no or transient ascites, partial thrombosis of large-sized hepatic veins with chronic ascites, and complete thrombosis of large-sized hepatic veins with a life-threatening course. These three groups did not differ with regard to sex, age, and duration and characteristics of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In view of the relationship between prognosis and the extent of hepatic vein obstruction, we suggest that early therapy directed toward limiting the extension of thrombosis, or toward dissolving formed thrombi, should improve the prognosis of this severe complication of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\r"

An abnormal fecal fat excretion (mean 15.8 g/24 h, range 6-31 g/24 h) was demonstrated in 10 of 12 patients with the icteric form of ICP and in 2 of 11 patients with pruritus gravidarum. The increased fecal fat excretion was generally asymptomatic, could be detected as early as 3 wk after the clinical onset of ICP, remained stable during the affected pregnancies, and returned to normal from 3 to 9 wk after delivery. Steatorrhea correlated with the severity of ICP, estimated by serum levels of bilirubin, total bile salts, and glutamic pyruvic transaminase. A significant fall in the maternal weight/height index was detected after the onset of ICP, being more intense in patients with steatorrhea than in those without it (to 92.6% +/- 3.0% of initial values versus 96.7% +/- 2.8%, respectively; p less than 0.05). A high risk of premature deliveries and fetal distress was demonstrated in these patients, also correlating with the severity of ICP. No direct relationship could be established between steatorrhea or maternal nutritional impairment and fetal prognosis.\r"

Portal vein ligation (after prior subcutaneous transposition of the spleen) results in complete portal bypass of splanchnic blood. In addition, significant hepatocellular damage was superimposed on this model of portosystemic shunting by ligation of the common bile duct. Plasma GABA-like activity (determined by radioreceptor assay) and true plasma GABA concentrations (determined by high-performance liquid chromatography) were found to be significantly increased in both portal vein-ligated and portal vein and bile duct-ligated rats, compared with controls. However, plasma GABA-like activity was consistently greater than the concentration of true GABA in the plasma of all rats. This suggested the presence of a GABA-like factor in plasma that can inhibit [3H]GABA binding, but is not GABA itself. The concentration of this GABA-like factor was significantly increased in the plasma of rats with chronic hepatic encephalopathy. Despite the significant increase in plasma GABA-like activity and plasma GABA concentrations, there was no alteration in the affinity or density of the physiologically relevant, low-affinity brain GABA binding site in the rats with portal vein ligation, with or without bile duct ligation. There was also no significant alteration in brain benzodiazepine binding in these rats. GABA enhancement of benzodiazepine binding was unchanged in the portal vein-ligated rats. However, the maximal enhancement of benzodiazepine binding was decreased in the rats with portal vein and bile duct ligation. There appears to be no substantial evidence that brain GABAergic neurotransmission is increased in these models of chronic hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

Ordinary sedative doses (0.25 mg) were given p.o. to 8 cirrhotics and 18 controls. Plasma concentrations of unbound drug were assessed by capillary gas chromatography and equilibrium dialysis. Median apparent oral clearances of unbound triazolam were 14.8 ml per min per kg in cirrhotics and 23.9 ml per min per kg in controls (p less than 0.01). Clearances were significantly correlated with severity of liver disease as assessed by the aminopyrine breath test (Rs = 0.77, n = 17, p less than 0.001). At a time when plasma concentrations of unbound triazolam were the same in both groups, i.e., 2.25 hr after dosing, flicker sensitivity at 5 Hz which was used as an index of CNS performance was impaired by a factor of 3.2 in cirrhotics and 1.4 in controls (p less than 0.01 for group difference). Performance was also significantly lower in cirrhotics with the digit symbol substitution test (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that, in patients with cirrhosis, disproportional sedation after benzodiazepine administration may be due not only to impaired drug elimination, but also to hypersensitivity of the brain.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the acute effects of ketanserin, a serotonin S2 antagonist, on systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics in 11 patients with cirrhosis. Mean arterial pressure decreased moderately but significantly after ketanserin. This effect was maximal at 5 min and correlated to the severity of cirrhosis. Cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance were not significantly changed. The hepatic venous pressure gradient, used as an index of portal pressure, significantly decreased after ketanserin (-23%). Azygos blood flow, a reflection of superior portosystemic collateral blood flow, also significantly decreased (-26%), but this effect was delayed, progressive and not correlated to the arterial pressure decrease. Hepatic blood flow was unchanged. These findings suggest that the systemic and splanchnic circulations may be hypersensitive to ketanserin in cirrhotic patients, and that serotonergic mechanisms may contribute to maintain portal hypertension. New specific antiserotonergic drugs deserve further evaluation for potential therapeutic implications in portal hypertension.\r"

This study was designed to investigate the hemodynamic effects of short- and long-term administration of propranolol in portal hypertensive patients. Portal pressure, cardiac index, heart rate and blood pressure were obtained in 18 unselected alcoholic cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices before and 60 min after the oral administration of 40 mg propranolol and again after 106 +/- 35 days of continuous oral administration (mean dose = 158 +/- 63 mg per day). Baseline portal pressure was 21.7 +/- 7.2 mm Hg. It decreased after 60 min to 17.2 +/- 5.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and after long-term administration of propranolol to 16.1 +/- 5.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). No decrease in portal pressure was noted in 9 of 18 (50%) patients after acute administration and 5 of 17 (30%) patients after long-term administration. Baseline cardiac index was 5.1 +/- 1.2 liters X min-1 X m-2. It decreased after 60 min to 3.9 +/- 1.4 liters X min-1 X m-2 (p less than 0.01) and to 3.6 +/- 1.0 liters X min-1 X m-2 after long-term administration (p less than 0.001).

The Child-Turcotte classification, as modified by Pugh et al., was recorded on admission in 177 cirrhotic patients. The variables that comprise the Pugh modification are ascites, encephalopathy, serum albumin, serum bilirubin and prothrombin time. Using multiple logistic regression, we evaluated the contribution of different models to the likelihood of survival, defining different ways to use the Pugh score. The Pugh score categorized in three strata (5 to 6, 7 to 9 and 10 to 15) captured less variance in the survival than the Pugh score counted from 5 to 15. This, in turn, captured less variance than a model in which the parameters of the Pugh score were analyzed according to their original units. The prediction rule based on the last model was tested in another sample of cirrhotics. The \"original unit\" model was studied in both training and testing samples, using receiver-operating characteristic curves to evaluate its clinical validity (sensitivity and specificity). The prediction rule based on the \"original units\" Pugh score allowed for a good discrimination of patients who lived and those who died. (At the point of maximum discrimination, sensitivity and specificity reached a mean of 80%). Validity of the prediction rule was confirmed by the testing sample. The qualities of simplicity, availability, low cost and good discriminating power for a life or death outcome make the Pugh score a very useful method to estimate prognosis in patients with cirrhosis.\r"

  ".U": "87277975\r", 
  ".W": "Two types of models have recently been proposed to describe hepatic uptake kinetics of protein bound drugs: a model in which dissociation from plasma protein is rate limiting the process, and a model in which an interaction between protein and hepatocyte surface is thought to promote dissociation and uptake of the drug. This study was designed to investigate several aspects of both models, using lactosylated albumin as a binding protein that can interact with the Ashwell receptor abundantly present on the hepatocyte. Dibromosulfophthalein clearance was studied in rat liver in the presence of 150 microM (1%) albumin or 150 microM lactosylated albumin. Initial disappearance rate from perfusate in the presence of lactosylated albumin indicated a 2-fold decrease in hepatic uptake rate compared with native albumin. This was confirmed by compartmental analysis, showing a similar decrease in hepatic uptake rate constant. Protein binding of dibromosulfophthalein to lactosylated albumin was only marginally different from normal albumin. Consequently, modification of the protein retarded uptake of the organic anion at an essentially unchanged unbound concentration. Fluorescence spectroscopy of lactosylated albumin showed a blue-shifted tryptophan emission spectrum compared with albumin, indicating increased hydrophobicity of the neoglycoprotein. We therefore considered a change in off-and-on rate for binding of dibromosulfophthalein in lactosylated albumin. Rapid filtration experiments indicated that the dissociation rate constant of dibromosulfophthalein from lactosylated albumin was half that of controls. We conclude that the decreased off-rate from lactosylated albumin can explain the retarding influence on hepatic uptake rate of dibromosulfophthalein. This observation argues for the concept of dissociation-limited uptake in the hepatic clearance of the organic anion.\r"

Three individuals became HBsAg-negative, 4 lost HBeAg but remained HBsAg-positive and 1 remained positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg. Initiation of interferon treatment was rapidly followed by reduction or loss of hepatitis B virus DNA in the serum but by little immediate change in hepatitis B virus antigen levels. Changes in hepatitis B virus antigens were usually delayed. Loss of HBsAg from the serum was preceded by the sequential disappearance of pre-S-encoded proteins (pre-S1 and polymerized human serum albumin) and HBeAg. In patients who lost HBeAg but remained HBsAg-positive, serum levels of pre-S1 and polymerized human serum albumin usually, but did not always, decrease. The individual who remained HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive had unchanged serum levels of pre-S1, polymerized human serum albumin and HBsAg. These results suggest that alpha-interferon inhibits hepatitis B virus DNA replication but has little direct effect on synthesis of hepatitis B virus gene products.\r"

Eight HBsAg-positive patients were followed for an average of 15 months prior to, while three others presented during reactivation. Fatigue, hepatomegaly and jaundice were frequent findings. Elevation of both serum ALT (average = 1,212 units per liter) and hepatitis B virus DNA levels were noted in all patients, and reactivation lasted an average of 4.4 months. During resolution, clinical symptoms abated, serum ALT levels reverted toward normal, and in nine patients, the hepatitis B virus DNA values became undetectable. All patients lacked evidence for acute hepatitis A, Epstein-Barr Virus, cytomegalovirus or hepatitis delta virus infection. Histologic findings of liver tissue from eight patients showed piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis. Within the parenchyma, varying degrees of hepatocytolysis with cuffing, perivenular necrosis and acidophilic bodies were noted. Ground-glass cells and regenerative changes also were observed. Cirrhosis was not present in any of the liver biopsies. These findings suggest that spontaneous reactivation of hepatitis B occurs in heterosexual patients with chronic active hepatitis B and contributes to chronic inflammation and to the progression of their liver disease.\r"

Intramuscular injection of a standard inoculum of duck hepatitis B virus into 2- to 5-day-old Pekin ducklings hatched from a duck hepatitis B virus-free flock resulted in viremia in 100% of 107 animals, indicating that duck hepatitis B virus infection of young progeny of a defined duck hepatitis B virus-free flock occurs reproducibly. When the same inoculum was injected into chicks and Muscovy ducklings of the same age, no evidence of viral infection was detectable. In contrast, hatchlings of two domestic breeds of geese were readily infected by duck hepatitis B virus, developing viremia at a slower rate than Pekin ducklings, but a higher average titer of viremia 4 weeks or more after injection. Neither the pattern of restriction enzyme sites in the viral DNA nor the susceptibility of ducklings to the virus were detectably altered after passage in geese. As in duck hepatitis B virus-infected young ducklings, most of the experimentally infected goslings appeared to be persistently infected and those eventually laying eggs transmitted virus to the progeny. While ducklings exhibited a fairly uniform inflammatory response to the virus, duck hepatitis B virus inoculation of the goslings resulted in both inflammation and an altered hepatocellular morphology not seen in uninjected controls. The host range of duck hepatitis B virus appears to be limited to the primary host and a close taxonomic relative, similar to other members of the hepadnavirus family, hepatitis B virus and ground squirrel hepatitis virus.\r"

One patient was premenopausal, one patient was postmenopausal and three had had oophorectomy. After 2 weeks of ethinyl estradiol, AST was under 100 IU per dl in all and had decreased by 50% or more in 4 of 5 patients. gamma-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase fell by 50 and 30% or more, respectively, in all patients. The decreases in serum enzymes were statistically significant in all patients for gamma-glutamyltransferase, in 4 of 5 for AST and in 3 of 5 for alkaline phosphatase. One patient developed increased icterus leading to withdrawal of estradiol. Withdrawal of estradiol was followed by return toward control values over variable periods, usually 1 to 4 weeks. Repeated courses of estradiol reproduced these enzyme changes. These observations indicate that estradiol in the doses used (0.05 mg per day) reversibly lowers serum enzyme values in biliary cirrhosis. The mechanism of the effect is unexplained, but an immune system alteration may be responsible.\r"

Integrated viral DNA was found in all five tumors, but episomal DNA was not detected in the neoplastic tissue. In the nonneoplastic cirrhotic liver, episomal DNA was found in four cases and integrated viral DNA in four cases. A large amount of hepatitis B virus-specific RNA transcripts was demonstrated in nonneoplastic liver of all five cases. Two major transcripts, 2.4 and 3.4 kb in length, were identified. The former hybridized with the S gene probe and the latter with the C gene probe, suggesting that they were messenger RNAs for HBsAg and HBcAg, respectively. In contrast to nonneoplastic liver, RNA transcripts were found in the neoplastic portion in only two cases, small in quantity; they primarily hybridized with S and X, but not with C genes. Novel species of 4.0 and 3.9 kb transcripts were found in the neoplastic and the nonneoplastic portions, respectively, in one case.

  ".W": "To support our contention that the Wistar-Furth rat is resistant to mineralocorticoid hypertension, we assessed the effects of deoxycorticosterone (DOC) administration or renal artery stenosis on the development of hypertension in the Sprague-Dawley and Wistar-Furth rat strains. Weekly administration of mineralocorticoid in the form of DOC pivalate resulted in rapid, severe hypertensive cardiovascular disease in Sprague-Dawley rats. Within 5 weeks the mean conscious systolic blood pressures in steroid-treated and control rats were 186 +/- 4 and 118 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively. In contrast, blood pressures of Wistar-Furth rats were only moderately elevated, even after 10 weeks of DOC pivalate administration (136 +/- 2 vs 116 +/- 2 mm Hg for controls). Furthermore, none of the steroid-treated Wistar-Furth animals exhibited cardiovascular lesions. In parallel studies, littermates of these rat strains were subjected to renal artery stenosis and blood pressures were determined weekly in conscious rats. Silver clip constriction of the left renal artery, in the presence of the contralateral kidney, resulted in a rapid, sustained elevation of blood pressure in both Sprague-Dawley and Wistar-Furth rat strains (177 +/- 4 and 176 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively). Corticosteroid levels were also determined in DOC-treated Sprague-Dawley and Wistar-Furth rats. The regimen employed resulted in a 10-fold increase in DOC levels as compared with controls, and the levels achieved were comparable in both strains. Thus, the Wistar-Furth rat appears to be selectively resistant to mineralocorticoid hypertensive vascular disease and thus affords a model for studying mechanisms of steroid hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The link between dietary salt intake and the development of hypertension in the salt-sensitive Dahl strain of rats remains elusive. There is evidence that Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DS) produce less vasodilator and natriuretic prostaglandins in response to salt loading than do control salt-resistant rats (DR), although the reason for this blunted response is unknown. We examined the effects of chronic dietary salt loading on the plasma levels of nonesterified fatty acids in DS and DR. Animals were fed the same chow containing either 0.4% or 4% NaCl (wt/wt). At 12 weeks, 75 microliters of tail capillary blood was obtained from restrained, conscious rats, and principal nonesterified fatty acids were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Total nonesterified fatty acids rose in the 15 DR on high salt diets compared with values in 11 rats eating low salt (0.57 +/- 0.05 vs 0.35 +/- 0.01 mM; p less than 0.001). The greatest changes occurred in levels of arachidonic acid (+287%) and in the arachidonic precursors, linoleic (+89%) and linolenic (+107%) acids. In marked contrast, there was no change in levels of plasma nonesterified fatty acids in DS fed 4% NaCl compared with DS fed 0.4% NaCl. These observations suggest that defective production of natriuretic and vasodilator prostaglandins by DS may be due in part to an inability to produce or release eicosanoid precursors from phospholipid stores in response to dietary salt.\r"

We evaluated Na+-K+ pump and cotransport in 30 hypertensive and 26 normotensive subjects subdivided by race and family history of hypertension using an improved method to examine the kinetics of Na and K effluxes. RBCs were Na-loaded by the nystatin method to five different levels of internal Na with pump determined as ouabain-sensitive Na efflux and cotransport as furosemide-sensitive Na and K efflux. Two kinetic parameters were determined for both transport systems: the apparent affinity for Na (K0.5) and the velocity of efflux at saturating internal Na concentration (Vmax). Mean intracellular Na content in fresh RBCs (mmol/L cells) was higher in black hypertensive (12.6 +/- 1.8 mmol/L cells) and normotensive subjects (10.9 +/- 1.2 mmol/L cells) than in white hypertensive (8.7 +/- 1.0 mmol/L cells) or normotensive subjects (8.5 +/- 0.8 mmol/L cells). The Vmax and K0.5 for pump were not significantly different between study groups. The Vmax for cotransport was elevated in white hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects, but the K0.5 values were similar. Black normotensive and hypertensive subjects displayed a lower Vmax and increased K0.5 for cotransport compared with the white groups. A family history of hypertension had no influence on cotransport kinetics in blacks but did predict white normotensive and hypertensive subjects with low cotransport. The reduction in intracellular Na affinity for cotransport in black subjects may explain their higher intracellular Na in fresh RBCs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this report, changes in blood pressure levels in the United States are assessed based on nationally representative health (and nutrition) examination surveys conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics in 1960 to 1962, 1971 to 1974, and 1976 to 1980. Analysis of age-adjusted data for adults aged 18 to 74 years (including those on antihypertensive medication) indicates that between the first and third surveys for whites and blacks, respectively, mean systolic blood pressure declined 5 and 10 mm Hg; the proportion of persons with systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher fell 18 and 31%; the proportion with undiagnosed hypertension decreased 17 and 59%; and the proportion taking antihypertensive medications rose 71 and 31%. These differences between the first and third surveys were all statistically significant (p less than 0.05 or better). Changes in diastolic blood pressure levels were generally not significant among race-sex groups. The proportion of persons with definite hypertension (i.e., systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg, and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg, and/or taking antihypertensive medication) declined among blacks but rose slightly among whites. Study results are consistent with the recent decline in cardiovascular disease mortality.\r"
