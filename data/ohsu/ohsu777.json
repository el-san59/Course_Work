  ".W": "The tobacco industry has lobbied successfully to obtain the support of the United States government for opening Asian Markets to American tobacco products. This paper comments on two issues arising from these efforts: the development of an atmosphere of invasion and resistance to invasion in Asia; and the change in the image of the United States in Asian nations from that of a leader in health to that of an exporter of death. The threat of sanctions and the effects of the open market and United States tobacco company advertising in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea are noted. Parallels are drawn between the opium wars a century and a half ago in China and the current threat of trade sanctions. Reacting to American policy, an Asia-Pacific Association for Control of Tobacco has been formed and linked with the US Coalition Against Smoking.\r"

Subjects were administered the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule (NIMH-DIS). The jail prevalence rates were then compared with general population data from the five-city Epidemiologic Catchment Area program using difference of proportion tests and loglinear analysis. After controlling for demographic differences between the jail and five-city samples, the jail prevalence rates were still two to three times higher than those in the general population. These findings suggest several public policy modifications concerning the psychiatric management of our burgeoning jail population.\r"

Occupations with no presumed exposure to diesel fumes were used as the nonexposed group. The study population consisted of 996 cases and 1,085 controls who had died in 1982-83 after applying for pensions. Next of kin provided information on smoking, work history, and other potential confounders. Work history data were also obtained from the Teamsters Union. While no single job category had a significant excess risk compared to the non-exposed group, certain sub-groups were elevated. The odds ratio for those with long-term employment as long-haul truckers after 1959 (an approximate date for the introduction of diesel engines) was 1.55 (95% CI: 0.97, 2.47). Long-term drivers of primarily diesel trucks had an odds ratio of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.42). Overall, our results suggest that diesel truck drivers have an excess risk of lung cancer compared to other teamsters in jobs outside the trucking industry. However, our findings were not uniformly consistent and our data have many limitations, the most important of which is the lack of data on exposure to diesel fumes.\r"

We conducted matched co-twin analyses of 250 pairs of White, male, monozygotic twins from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Twin Study. Entirely in the absence of genetic influences, obesity was significantly associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures; one-hour, post-load glucose; total, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol; and triglycerides among these 42-55 year old men. Similar results were obtained in longitudinal analyses of weight change during adulthood (from mean age of 20 to mean age of 48 years) and risk factor status at middle-age. These results indicate that behaviors and environmental exposures that occur later in life are responsible, at least in part, for the associations between adult obesity and cardiovascular disease risk, supporting the appropriateness of weight reduction efforts during adulthood.\r"

Thirty-one percent of Blacks and 4 percent of Whites resided in census tracts with median family incomes less than or equal to $10,000/year. Only 2 percent of Black mothers, compared to 16 percent of White mothers, lived in areas where the median family income was greater than $25,000/year. Among Blacks with incomes less than or equal to $10,000/year, maternal age, education, and marital status had minimal predictive power on the incidence of low birthweight (LBW) infants. Among high-risk mothers in the poorest areas the proportion of LBW infants in Blacks and Whites was less divergent than in higher income areas. Independent of residential area, low-risk Whites had half the occurrence of LBW infants as Blacks. We conclude that the extremes of residential environments show dramatic racial disparity in prevalence, yet the few low-risk Blacks still do less well than low-risk Whites. Traditional risk factors do not completely explain racial differences in neonatal outcome.\r"

We estimate that between July 1984 and December 1988 there were 3,110 additional low-birthweight births to Blacks and 1,385 additional low-birthweight births to Whites above what would have been expected had the rate of low birthweight not shifted upwards. The incremental costs of treating these infants in their first year of life is estimated at over $22,000,000 in 1986 dollars.\r"

The mean birthweight increased from 3188 grams in 1980-81 to 3283 grams in 1986, an annual increment of about 18 grams (95% CI = 11, 25 grams). The prevalence of low birthweight (less than 2500 grams) decreased from 7.2 percent in 1980-81 to 5.4 percent in 1986, an annual reduction of 6.4 percent (95% CI = 1.3, 11.2 percent). In an analysis of information ascertained from the birth certificate, the change of paternal occupational status (from student to employed) was associated with 27 percent of the reduction in the prevalence of low birthweight, independent of maternal age, infant sex, and prior gravidity. A similar temporal change of birthweight during the same period of time was not observed among infants of US-born Asian mothers. Among the women who had two consecutive births from 1984 to 1986, the improvement of birthweight for the second birth compared to the first birth was much greater in infants born to the Southeast Asian mothers than that to White mothers. Our study suggests that living in the United States after immigration from their native countries has had a positive impact on the birthweight of infants born to Southeast Asian immigrants.\r"

Two of the three treated rooms were ventilated following application. Maximum air concentrations were measured 3-7 hours post-application. Peak concentrations in the infant breathing zone were 94 micrograms/m3 in the nonventilated room and 61 micrograms/m3 in the ventilated room, and were substantially higher than concentrations in the sitting adult breathing zone. Concentrations of approximately 30 micrograms/m3 were detected in the infant breathing zone 24 hours post-application. Surface residues available through wipe sampling were 0.7-1.6 micrograms/cm2 of carpet on the day of application and 0.3-0.5 micrograms/cm2 24 hours post-application. Estimated total absorbed doses for infants were 0.08-0.16 mg/kg on the day of application and 0.04-0.06 mg/kg the day following application, with dermal absorption representing approximately 68 percent of the totals. These doses are 1.2-5.2 times the human No Observable Effect Level (NOEL). Exposures to cholinesterase inhibiting compounds following properly conducted broadcast applications could result in doses at or above the threshold of toxicological response in infants, and should be minimized through appropriate regulatory policy and public education.\r"

We used data from the 1982 Puerto Rico Fertility and Family Planning Assessment to describe the trend in the incidence of breastfeeding in Puerto Rico over time and to ascertain some of its determinants. From 1946 through 1982, 5,884 infants were born among this statistically representative sample of reproductive-aged women. The proportion of infants who had ever been breastfed was 59 percent for births before 1960 (mean duration = 7.8 months), dropped to 25 percent for infants born from 1970 to 1974 (mean duration = 4.9), and rose to 38 percent for births delivered from 1980 to 1982 (mean duration = 3.4). Prior breastfeeding experience was an important determinant of breastfeeding a newborn. Infants of mothers who had breastfed a previous baby were 7.3 times more likely to be breastfed (95% confidence interval = 6.6, 8.0) compared with infants of mothers who had not previously breastfed. The 38 percent of infants who were breastfed in Puerto Rico in the early 1980s is below the 74 percent to 97 percent reported in Latin America and below the 54 percent reported in the United States for the same period. This study provides baseline data for any future intervention strategies.\r"

Translation of the questionnaire was obtained from experts and from a Spanish monolingual lay group. Construct validity of the version was assessed in two studies: testing relationship of NHP scores to other self-reported measures of health in a general population survey; and comparing NHP scores for a group of frequent users and for a group of non-users of primary health services. Mean scores of NHP dimensions were higher for people with poorer self-reported health and higher for the frequent health services users than for the non-users. Findings suggest that the Spanish version of the NHP is culturally equivalent to the original questionnaire, and has a similar level of construct validity. Nevertheless, further research on reliability and on the weighting system is required to establish the equivalence of the Spanish version definitively.\r"

It should be remembered that scientific uncertainty may be exploited by special interest groups as a shield for opposition to the measure. Public policy decisions may be said to be made or not made on the basis of scientific uncertainty, but they may in actuality be driven by political or economic considerations. With respect to balancing individual rights and the public interest, it is clear that, in many instances, these two interests will be congruent. If they conflict, however, then weight should be given to the public interest in line with the principle that public health is social justice.\r"

Each subject returned within 1 week for retests to establish reliability. The average correlational coefficient across tests was 0.87. The Merac computer system was used to analyze data. Mean and standard deviations for peak torque to body weight were calculated. A paired t-test was used to examine the difference in the means for internal and external rotation between the two positions. The results indicated no significant difference between the two positions for shoulder internal rotational strength values. However, shoulder external rotational strength values in the plane of the scapula were statistically significantly higher than in the frontal plane (P less than 0.001). These preliminary results suggest isokinetic strength training and testing may be preferable in the plane of the scapula rather than the frontal plane.\r"

All measurements except sit and reach flexibility were obtained goniometrically. Tennis players were significantly tighter in sit and reach flexibility, dominant shoulder internal rotation, and nondominant shoulder internal rotation. They were significantly more flexible in dominant shoulder external rotation and nondominant shoulder external rotation. The flexibility differences found in tennis players suggest adaptations to the musculoskeletal demands of their sport. These results suggest that a sport-specific flexibility program may be necessary for junior elite tennis players in order to promote maximum performance and help prevent flexibility-related injuries.\r"

Paired tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles in the rabbit hindlimb were passively heated to different temperatures and then subjected to controlled strain injury. The parameters examined were: 1) percent increase in length to failure, 2) force to failure, 3) energy absorbed by the musculotendinous unit to failure, and 4) site of failure. Warmed (39 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C) TA (P less than or equal to 0.01) and EDL (P less than or equal to 0.05) muscles achieved a greater increase in length from rest before failing than did their contralateral controls at 35 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C. In both the TA and EDL the force at failure was greater at 35 degrees C than at 39 degrees C, although the difference was significant for only the EDL (P less than or equal to 0.05). The energy absorbed (area beneath the length-tension curve) by both the TA and EDL was greater at 39 degrees C, but these differences were not significant. All muscles failed at the distal musculotendinous junction. These data suggest that passive warming increases the extensibility of the musculotendinous unit and may thereby reduce its susceptibility to strain injury.\r"

  ".W": "The use of a central one-third patellar tendon as an autograft for surgical reconstruction of a damaged cruciate ligament is common. Few complications of its use have been reported. However, recent clinical studies indicate that decreased quadriceps strength, decreased range of motion, decreased thigh circumference, and patellofemoral problems can be associated with this procedure. Some of these complications may result from alterations in the biomechanical properties of the remaining patellar tendon. The objective of this study was to examine biomechanically and histologically the fate of the remaining patellar tendon after removal of its central one-third. Three groups of dogs were used for this study. On one knee the central third of the patellar tendon was removed, while the contralateral side was used as a control. One group was immediately euthanized, while the other two groups were euthanized at 3 and 6 months. Control and operated patella-patellar tendon-tibia preparations were harvested and stretched to failure at 100% strain per second. The 3 and 6 month groups had a 10% decrease in length of the operated patellar tendon versus the contralateral control. There was a very significant increase in cross-sectional area of the patellar tendon at 3 months, and a further increase at 6 months. The failure load was 70% of the controls at 3 months and 60% of the controls at 6 months. The stiffness and modulus of the operated tendon within the physiologic range were dramatically reduced to 70% and 33% of controls at 6 months, respectively. These overall results were observed with the central one-third defect closed or left open in surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Our purpose in this investigation was to describe and compare several morphological, histological, vascular, and biochemical healing processes of allograft and autograft bone-medial collateral ligament-bone complexes in a rabbit model. Forty-nine animals had their right medial collateral ligament complex replaced with a frozen allograft while 30 separate control animals each received a fresh autograft. Animals were sacrificed at 3, 6, 12, 24, or 48 weeks after transplantation for comparison of grafted with unoperated contralateral control complexes. Results demonstrate some recovery of both allografts and autografts over time. Allografts generally showed slower recovery than autografts with more persistent abnormalities in gross appearances, increased cellularity (corresponding to increased DNA content), and decreased collagen content. Allografts also showed aggressive remodeling of bone at insertions and they remained hypervascular throughout their substance as compared with contralateral controls. Autografts went through similar but less chronic increases in cellularity and DNA concentration with no changes in collagen content. While both types of grafts showed some signs of \"healing\" and some recovery of control ligament biology, results are also consistent with allograft encasement, infiltration, and at least partial replacement by host tissue. This was particularly true of insertions. Collectively, these results also demonstrate some differences between allografts and autografts in this extraarticular model. The causes, mechanisms, and longer-term consequences of these changes, including defining the qualities of these graft and host tissues, clearly requires further investigation.\r"

We used an experimental knee testing system to analyze the immediate postoperative mechanical effect of an iliotibial band tenodesis on an intraarticular reconstruction of the ACL in fresh cadaver knees using a composite graft consisting of a bone-patellar tendonbone segment augmented with the Kennedy Ligament Augmentation Device (LAD, 3M Co., St. Paul, MN). The intraarticular graft was standardized by using a forcesetting technique. Ligament and graft forces were measured using buckle transducers, and joint motion was measured using an instrumented spatial linkage as 90 N anteriorly directed tibial loads were applied to seven fresh knee specimens at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees of flexion. The following knee states were tested in each specimen: intact ACL, excised ACL, intraarticular reconstruction, intraarticular reconstruction with the tenodesis added, and tenodesis with the intraarticular reconstruction added. Adding the iliotibial band tenodesis to an existing standardized intraarticular reconstruction significantly decreased the force in the ACL composite graft by an average of 43%. When the standardized intraarticular reconstruction was added to an existing tenodesis, the graft forces were an average of 15% below the level of when the reconstruction was performed alone. The force in the tenodesis was significantly less than the composite graft force at extension; however, the differences between the tenodesis and total graft force were not significant from 30 degrees to 90 degrees of flexion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The runners were tested in identical shoes with and without the distal 2 cm of the firm heel counter. Body load was expressed by absolute and relative VO2, surface EMG on the right leg, and g-force registration from an accelerometer below the right tibial tuberosity. The heel counter caused a 2.4% significant decrease in VO2, a reduction in musculoskeletal transients, and a decrease in the activity of the triceps surae and quadriceps muscles at heel strike. The changes found are expressions of kinematic adaptations in the body to increased or decreased load and provide functional evidence for the loading factor in the pathophysiology of overuse injuries.\r"

  ".W": "The electromyographic (EMG) coactivation patterns of the knee flexors and extensors when acting as antagonists were studied as a function of limb velocity to assess their contribution to joint stiffness and laxity. Normalized antagonist coactivation patterns developed from surface EMG recordings from the hamstrings and quadriceps during maximal effort isokinetic extension and flexion, respectively, demonstrated characteristic variations as the joint velocity increased from 15 deg/sec up to 240 deg/sec. The two-tailed t-test (P less than 0.01) was performed on the data obtained from eight normal knees. The results indicate that both hamstrings and quadriceps demonstrate a significant increase (greater than 100%) in their antagonist coactivation pattern during the final 40 degrees of fast extension and flexion movements, respectively, as limb velocity increases. A minor decrease in antagonist activity of the hamstrings (24%) and quadriceps (8%) was evident during the initial phase of the extension and flexion movements, respectively, as joint velocity increased. We concluded that as limb velocity is increased, there is a substantial reflexive (unintentional) increase in the contribution of the antagonist musculature to joint stiffness and reduction of laxity. The results also suggest that strength training of the hamstrings (rather than quadriceps) should be considered as a modality for conservative treatment of ACL deficiencies, as well as an adjunct to surgical reconstruction. Such training can also reduce the risk of high performance athletes in a reflexive manner by increasing joint stiffness.\r"

We studied the anterior talofibular, calcaneofibular, posterior talofibular, anterior tibiofibular, and posterior tibiofibular ligaments. Strain measurements in the ligaments were recorded continuously while the ankle was moved from dorsiflexion into plantar flexion. We then repeated measurements while applying inversion, eversion, internal rotation, and external rotation forces. Strain in the anterior talofibular ligament increased when the ankle was moved into greater degrees of plantar flexion, internal rotation, and inversion. Strain in the calcaneofibular ligament increased as the talus was dorsiflexed and inverted. These findings support the concept that the anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments function together at all positions of ankle flexion to provide lateral ankle stability. We measured maximum strain in the posterior talofibular ligament when the ankle was dorsiflexed and externally rotated. The strain in the anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments increased when the ankle was dorsiflexed. External rotation increased strain in the anterior tibiofibular ligament and decreased strain in the posterior tibiofibular ligament. Based upon strain measurements in the lateral ankle ligaments in various ankle joint positions, we believe the anterior talofibular ligament is most likely to tear if the ankle is inverted in plantar flexion and internally rotated. Theoretically, the calcaneofibular ligament tears primarily in inversion if the ankle is dorsiflexed; the anterior tibiofibular ligament tears in dorsiflexion, especially if combined with external rotation; and the posterior tibiofibular ligament tears with extreme dorsiflexion.\r"

Results from a number of crash simulations suggest that the mechanisms of head impact causing brain damage and those causing neck injury are different. The idea that neck injuries can be predicted from results of helmet drop tests or that the helmet is capable of providing protection to the cervical spine is unsupported. In head-first collisions causing axial compressive loading, the cushioning properties of the helmet alone would dictate the maximum force on the neck if both the head and neck were rigid. Since the head and neck are not rigid and appear to be as stiff or less stiff than the helmet, the cushioning influence of the helmet is minimized, so the forces experienced by the neck are dictated largely by its own properties. The helmet does not have a large influence. To be effective, the helmet would have to be much less stiff than it is at present and would have to maintain this low stiffness under very large loads. These conditions would be difficult to achieve without making the helmet disproportionately larger than it is now.\r"

Eleven gymnasts had suffered from episodes of low back pain during exercises and eight were found to have evidence of back trauma. Only 3 of the 35 gymnasts had MRI evidence of degenerated discs associated with Scheuermann's manifestations and spondylolysis. Lumbar radiographs confirmed the diagnosis in these three cases. The results indicate that despite the excessive range of motion and strong axial loading of the lumbar spine that are associated with gymnastic maneuvers, incurable primary damage to the intervertebral discs is uncommon in young gymnasts during growth.\r"

The mean total body clearance (+/- SD) of ropivacaine was 1.00 +/- 0.27 L/min. There was significant clearance of ropivacaine by the liver (0.85 +/- 0.32 L/min), gut (0.09 +/- 0.07 L/min), and kidneys (0.04 +/- 0.03 L/min). There was no significant clearance of ropivacaine by the lungs, brain, heart, or hindquarters. It was concluded that the liver accounts for the majority of ropivacaine clearance.\r"

At the end of the surgical procedure, meperidine (0.7 mg/kg) was epidurally injected in six patients (group A). The other six patients (group B) received no epidural injections during the first 2 h after surgery. Intraoperatively, oxygen uptake decreased in both groups by an average of 28%. Within the first two postoperative hours, clear-cut differences among the two groups arose. Patients in group A had smoother increases in oxygen uptake and core temperatures, greater cardiovascular stability as reflected by the rate-pressure product, and no visible shivering. We suggest that epidural meperidine given immediately at the end of a surgical procedure might be beneficial, especially, perhaps, in patients with impaired cardiac function.\r"

To elucidate the response of breathing patterns to increased expiratory resistance during anesthesia, the respiratory effects of expiratory flow-resistive loading on breathing patterns were studied in 15 conscious and 10 lightly anesthetized subjects. Inspiratory time, expiratory time, respiratory frequency, inspiratory duty cycle, tidal volume, minute ventilation, and mean inspiratory flow rate were determined from a respiratory inductive plethysmograph. End-tidal CO2 was continuously recorded. In awake subjects, respiratory frequency was reduced without change in tidal volume or mean inspiratory flow rate, and minute ventilation was significantly decreased; the synchrony between rib cage and abdomen wall motion was well maintained during the loads. In contrast, in anesthetized subjects, respiratory frequency was reduced with remarkable increases in tidal volume, mean inspiratory flow rate, and minute ventilation, whereas coordination between rib cage and abdomen compartments was disturbed. End-tidal CO2 did not change in conscious subjects, but it increased in anesthetized subjects during the loads. These results indicate that there are differences between conscious and anesthetized subjects in breathing patterns during expiratory loading, and suggest that the ability to coordinate rib cage-abdomen wall motion is easily disturbed during anesthesia in patients with expiratory flow limitation.\r"

The three agents were associated with a dose-dependent decrease in end-diastolic length, indicating a decrease in left ventricular filling. This effect was most pronounced for propofol. At the doses tested, etomidate did not significantly alter regional myocardial function. Thiopental, however, was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in systolic shortening, which was significantly greater in the ischemic segment. These findings confirm the hemodynamic stability seen with etomidate and show that thiopental depresses myocardial function more in the acute ischemic heart than in the normal heart. The decrease in systolic shortening associated with propofol was similar in the normal and in the acute ischemic heart segment.\r"

By use of standard microelectrode techniques, effects of isoflurane on the maximum rate of rise of action potential upstroke (Vmax) and conduction velocity were examined in guinea pig papillary muscles. Isoflurane decreased action potential amplitude and action potential duration in a concentration-dependent fashion. Isoflurane at 1.5 and 2.0 MAC decreased conduction velocity with as little influence on the maximum rate of rise of action potential upstroke as that exerted by halothane and enflurane. However, the effect of isoflurane in slowing intraventricular conduction was less than that of halothane and enflurane when compared at equi-MAC concentrations. Thus, isoflurane may be a safer anesthetic for the patients with intraventricular conduction abnormalities.\r"

After intubation and institution of mechanical ventilation, arterial, venous, pulmonary artery, and sagittal sinus catheters were inserted. Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRo2), mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and blood gas tensions were made at various levels of isoflurane anesthesia (0.64%, 1.9%, and 2.8%), after the administration of 10 micrograms/kg of dexmedetomidine (a dose that has been shown to reduce anesthetic requirements in dogs by greater than 90%) and finally after 0.3 micrograms/kg of the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist idazoxan. Despite an increase in arterial pressure, dexmedetomidine caused a marked reduction (greater than 45%, P less than 0.05) in CBF when compared with all preceding concentrations of isoflurane. The administration of dexmedetomidine had no effect on the CMRo2. The electroencephalogram showed a loss of high-frequency activity in a pattern similar to that seen with 1.90% isoflurane. Administration of dexmedetomidine was associated with a 57% decrease in cardiac output (to 0.89 L/min). Administration of idazoxan (an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist) resulted in an increase in cardiac output and a reversal of the electroencephalogram effects. This experiment indicates that 10 micrograms/kg of dexmedetomidine in isoflurane-anesthetized dogs is associated with a profound decrease in CBF and cardiac output in the face of an unaltered CMRo2. Despite the large reduction in the CBF/CMRo2 ratio, there was no evidence of global cerebral ischemia.\r"

Preoperative antiplatelet medications were taken by 391 (39%) patients, including 113 patients receiving multiple drugs. No patient developed signs of spinal hematoma or postoperative neurologic deficits. However, patients receiving antiplatelet medications had an increased incidence of \"minor\" hemorrhagic complications such as blood-tinged cerebrospinal fluid or blood aspirated through the spinal or epidural needle or catheter (P less than 0.05). When considered independently as risk factors, age and epidural anesthesia were not statistically significant determinants of the incidence of minor hemorrhagic complications. The combination of increased age and epidural (but not spinal) anesthesia was associated with a 4.5% incidence of minor hemorrhagic complications (P less than 0.05). Aspiration of blood through the spinal or epidural needle may not imply an increased risk for serious hemorrhagic complications. Clinical and laboratory screening of patients for preexisting coagulopathies and atraumatic needle placement may reduce the risk of minor hemorrhagic complications involved in patients given antiplatelet medications before the induction of regional anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "The neurophysiological effects of ketamine were studied at the single-neuron level in the somatosensory cortex of unanesthetized rats behaving in a treadmill movement paradigm. Chronically implanted 25-microns microwire electrodes were used to record spontaneous discharge, sensory responses, and sensorimotor-correlated activity of single neurons before and after ketamine administration. Extracellular action potentials of up to six single neurons were simultaneously recorded for several days, allowing ketamine effects to be tested repeatedly on the same neurons. Videotaped recordings obtained during each experiment were used to measure both the sensorimotor properties of the neurons and the changes in these measures caused by different doses of ketamine. Behaviorally, ketamine produced restless-hyperactive behavior at subanesthetic doses from 5 to 20 mg/kg (intramuscularly). At higher doses (30-50 mg/kg) the rats became cataleptic and immobile after the initial hyperactive period. Whereas the spontaneous rates of most neurons were reduced or unchanged after subanesthetic doses, a subgroup (27% of the total) exhibited markedly increased firing rates. This excitation was of a tonic nature, persisting for a dose-dependent duration in a manner that was not correlated with any of the behavioral effects of the drug. In further analyses, ketamine suppressed the sensory responses of virtually all of the recorded neurons. In particular, low doses of ketamine suppressed \"sensorimotor\" firing (mainly proprioceptive responses) of neurons in relation to active limb movement. It also suppressed virtually all neuronal sensory responses to the sudden onset of treadmill movement, although the time-course of this effect varied from neuron to neuron. These results reveal two separable effects of ketamine: (a) a strong inhibition of all somatosensory responsiveness in this area and (b) a tonic excitatory influence expressed heterogeneously on a subgroup of neurons. This coexistence of cortical neuronal excitation and sensory suppression in the same cortical region may explain in part the mechanism of dissociative anesthesia and hallucinatory side effects observed in humans during emergence from ketamine anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to determine whether the discomfort associated with the sequential bursts of stimuli comprising the two recommended forms of double burst stimulation (DBS) is comparable to that associated with the repetitive stimuli of train-of-four (TOF). Twenty-one unmedicated volunteers rated on a visual analog scale the discomfort associated with randomly applied DBS and TOF stimulations at 20, 30 and 50 mA. All participants were blinded to the mode of stimulation, as well as to the current intensity. At each amperage tested, TOF produced significantly less discomfort than either form of DBS (P less than 0.01). Stimulation at 50 mA produced median visual analog scale scores of 7.5, 7.0, and 5.0 for DBS3,2, DBS3,3, and TOF, respectively. At 30 mA the corresponding median visual analog scale scores were 4.5, 5.5, and 3.0, whereas at 20 mA the scores were 4.0, 4.5, and 2.0, respectively. Thus, DBS is more uncomfortable than TOF at each current tested; however, in light of reports of its higher sensitivity, DBS may be the preferred means of assessing neuromuscular function in the awake as well as the anesthetized patient when a force transducer and recorder are not readily available.\r"

This need poses logistic and economic burdens if the effects of large numbers of new anesthetics are to be surveyed. We have devised a technique for determining the potential of a new anesthetic to produce arrhythmias using a smaller animal (the rat) than previous methods. Our technique requires preliminary selection of male rats sensitive to the arrhythmias produced by the intravenous injection of epinephrine. Rats are tested after demonstrating the desired sensitivity. Using this model, rats given 1.4% halothane developed premature ventricular extrasystoles at a dose of 2.4 +/- 1.0 micrograms/kg epinephrine, and those receiving 1.6%-2.2% isoflurane at a dose of 28 +/- 24 micrograms/kg. This difference in dose requirements is about two to three times that in humans.\r"

  ".W": "An ovine model of maternal iron poisoning in pregnancy was used to examine the placental transport of deferoxamine and ferrioxamine and to follow maternal and fetal serum iron concentrations when maternal serum iron levels exceeded total iron-binding capacity. Ewes in the third stage of gestation underwent hysterotomy and delivery of the fetal head through an abdominal incision while under ketamine and halothane anesthesia. The fetal external jugular vein was catheterized for sampling of venous blood while the fetus remained in utero. Administration of deferoxamine mesylate or ferrioxamine mesylate IV to ewes was not accompanied by measurable deferoxamine or ferrioxamine in fetal blood. In a final experiment, four gravid ewes in a control group received 2 mg/kg maternal body wt iron IV over 60 minutes. An experimental group comprising another four ewes received similar doses of iron but then received 50 mg/kg deferoxamine mesylate IV over 15 minutes. Control and deferoxamine ewes reached similar peak maternal serum iron concentrations (2,479 +/- 266 and 2,121 +/- 343 micrograms/dL, respectively). The markedly elevated maternal serum iron concentrations were not accompanied by meaningful elevations in fetal serum iron levels over baseline values. Maternal deferoxamine infusion resulted in a more rapid fall in maternal serum iron concentrations but had no effect on fetal serum iron levels. The ovine fetus appears to be protected from elevated maternal serum iron concentrations in the last trimester of pregnancy. It could not be demonstrated that meaningful quantities of deferoxamine or ferrioxamine cross the placenta in the last trimester.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subsequently, he was found to have a toxic serum methanol level (23 mg/dL). Toluene, methylene chloride, and methanol are widely used in industry and carry potential occupational risks for exposure.

Four seizures occurred in patients with prior seizures, while two had new onset seizures with levels of 27 and 30 micrograms/mL. All eight episodes of ventricular tachycardia occurred in patients who had a history of arrhythmias or who were critically ill. Seven patients had new supraventricular arrhythmias with levels of 21 to 40 micrograms/mL. Life-threatening events may occur in critically ill patients or patients with past seizures or arrhythmias with mildly elevated levels, although the extent to which theophylline toxicity contributes to morbidity or mortality in these patients is unclear. Patients who are otherwise healthy are unlikely to have significant theophylline toxicity with levels less than 25 micrograms/mL.\r"

An analysis of 91 patient cases is presented after excluding allergic reactions, cases involving coingestants, and patients lost to follow-up. Patients who developed any symptoms after ingestion were defined as manifesting toxicity. There were 38 cases of verapamil ingestion with toxicity developing in 18 patients. The mean nontoxic dose was 320 mg, whereas the mean toxic ingestion was 3.2 g. Nine patients became hypotensive, 13 developed conduction system abnormalities (sinus node suppression, atrioventricular nodal block, or bundle branch block), and 11 manifested arrhythmias. Ten developed neurological symptoms. There were 31 cases of nifedipine ingestion with toxicity developing in seven patients. The mean nontoxic dose was 19 mg, while the mean toxic ingestion was 340 mg. Four patients were hypotensive, only one developed cardiac conduction abnormalities, and four developed arrhythmias. Three had neurological symptoms. There were 24 cases of diltiazem ingestion with only minor toxicity developing in four patients. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of hypotension, arrhythmias, or neurological symptoms in patients who overdosed with verapamil as compared with nifedipine (by Fisher's exact test). However, conduction system abnormalities were more common with verapamil ingestion (P less than .05). Toxic manifestations after diltiazem over-dose were uncommon in our study. Eighteen of the 29 patients who developed toxicity required treatment in excess of gastrointestinal decontamination. Calcium was administered to 14 patients and was helpful in five.\r"

Sodium fluorescein is added to some commercial antifreeze preparations (ethylene glycol) to a final concentration of approximately 20 micrograms/mL as a colorant to aid in detection of automobile cooling-system leaks. For an adult human being, a potentially toxic volume of antifreeze is 30 mL, which contains 0.4 to 0.6 mg sodium fluorescein. Six male volunteers were given a 0.6-mg oral bolus of sodium fluorescein on an empty stomach. Urine was collected at two-hour intervals. Using a Wood's lamp, visually detectable fluorescence was seen with 100% reliability for two hours and 60% reliability for four hours. A second group of male volunteers was given the same dose of sodium fluorescein, and fluorescence was measured with a fluorometer during a six-hour period. Detectable fluorescence was present in all samples except the zero time point, including those with no fluorescence present by visual examination. We conclude that exposing urine to a Wood's lamp may be a useful adjunctive diagnostic test for early evaluation of patients with suspected antifreeze ingestion while awaiting definitive quantitative analysis of serum ethylene glycol concentration. A prospective clinical trial is needed to evaluate the frequency of false-positives and false-negatives.\r"

Although he felt a transient increase in his respiratory effort shortly after administration of the drug, he did not develop wheezing or require additional therapy for bronchospasm. The beta-blocking effect of labetalol is greater than the alpha antagonism. The patient exhibited evidence of mild alpha stimulation due to incomplete blockade. This is consistent with previous studies in that labetalol tends to less completely antagonize the alpha effects of a mixed alpha/beta agonist, resulting in a net clinical picture of mild alpha agonism.\r"

Treatment was assigned by month; all wounds were treated with one solution during each of the three months of the study. The wounds were closed with interrupted, simple nylon sutures. The number of wound infections was 13 (6.9%), eight (4.3%), and nine (5.6%) for groups receiving NS, PI, and SC, respectively. This was not statistically significant. We conclude that there is not a significant difference in infection rates among sutured wounds irrigated with NS, PI, or SC. The cost of NS was the lowest of the three treatments in our ED.\r"

Thirty-three heavily contaminated acute traumatic wounds in 29 patients were included in the study. Wounds were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Tissue samples were taken before and after a ten-minute period of soaking in either povidone-iodine or saline; controls were covered with gauze during the ten-minute period. The mean bacterial count per gram of tissue decreased 6.4 x 10(5) (standard deviation, 1.68 x 10(6)) after no soak, increased 3.39 x 10(7) (1.05 x 10(8)) after saline soak, and decreased 9.19 x 10(6) (1.72 x 10(7)) after povidone-iodine soak. Wounds with counts of less than 10(5) bacteria/g tissue are unlikely to become infected. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the changes in bacterial count after treatment as a function of experimental group and initial bacterial count. There was no significant difference between the control and povidone-iodine groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of an outpatient program designed to reduce readmissions for asthma exacerbations among adults with asthma. DESIGN: Randomized patient selection with crossover. SETTING: Bellevue Hospital, New York City, New York. PATIENTS: We identified 104 adult asthmatics who had previously required multiple hospitalizations for asthma attacks. Forty-seven patients were randomly assigned to an intensive outpatient treatment clinic and 57 patients continued to receive their previous outpatient care. Nineteen patients from this latter group were then crossed to the intensive outpatient therapy clinic. INTERVENTIONS: Attenders of the intensive outpatient treatment program were treated with a vigorous medical regimen and educational program. Emphasis was placed on teaching patients aggressive self-management strategies in case of marked asthma exacerbation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main measurement used to determine efficacy of the study program was readmission rate and hospital days used. Prospective comparison of treated compared with untreated patients indicated that program enrollment resulted in a threefold reduction in readmission rate and a twofold reduction in hospital day use rate (P less than 0.004 and P less than 0.02, respectively). Using retrospective data with patients serving as their own controls, we found a threefold reduction in readmission rate and in hospital day use (P less than 0.003) during a 32-month follow-up period. A similar magnitude of reduction in hospital utilization was found when patients were crossed over to the intensive treatment group (P less than 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: By using a vigorous medical regimen and intensive educational program, we were able to decrease hospital use among a group of adult asthmatics who had previously required repeated readmissions for acute asthma exacerbations.\r"

The major function of these antibiotics is to protect patients against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis infections. The lowest inoculum amount responsible for infection during surgery is unknown but is probably low. To determine the comparative activities of cefazolin, cefuroxime, and cefamandole against S. aureus and S. epidermidis for prophylactic purposes, we selected five strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis that presented homogeneous resistances to oxacillin. A continuously monitored turbidimetric method was used to evaluate cultures with variable inoculum sizes ranging from 10(6) to 1 CFU/ml and exposed to cefazolin, cefuroxime, and cefamandole at concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 micrograms/ml. Growth was defined as an increase of 0.1 optical density unit. The relationship between the time required for growth, the antibiotic concentration, and the initial bacterial density showed that cefamandole was more active than cefazolin, which, in turn, was revealed to be more active than cefuroxime against S. aureus and S. epidermidis.\r"

Concentrations of teicoplanin in serum exceeded the MIC by several hundredfold, yet teicoplanin was less rapidly bactericidal than penicillin both in vitro and for endocarditis caused by a strain of Streptococcus sanguis. Because teicoplanin was 90% protein bound in rabbit serum, low free-drug concentrations probably resulted in less activity in vivo than in vitro. Because teicoplanin has a relatively low bactericidal rate and a high degree of protein binding, a sustained concentration in serum several times greater than the MIC may be important for efficacy in vivo. An intravenous regimen with relatively high peak concentrations in serum was less effective than an intramuscular regimen for endocarditis caused by a strain of Staphylococcus aureus, indicating that high peaks are unlikely to be an important determinant of efficacy. The therapeutically more relevant concentration in serum may be the trough.\r"

The fraction of dose excreted unchanged in the urine was 84.0% +/- 26.1%. Subjects with CLCRS of 40 to 69 (group 2, n = 6) and 10 to 39 (group 3, n = 6) ml/min per 1.73 m2 demonstrated prolongation of the t1/2 beta (3.62 +/- 1.06 and 5.93 +/- 1.81 h, respectively) and significant reductions in cefmetazole CLP (52.8 +/- 14.3 and 30.2 +/- 10.2 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively), compared with group 1. In seven subjects on chronic hemodialysis (group 4) studied during an interdialytic period, the cefmetazole t1/2 beta was increased to 24.10 +/- 8.12 h and the CLP was reduced to 6.8 +/- 2.1 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Cefmetazole CLP correlated positively with CLCR (r = 0.951, P less than 0.001): CLP = (1.181 . CLCR) -- 0.287. The disposition of cefmetazole was also assessed in six group 4 subjects during an intradialytic period.

The differences in the efficacies of the triazoles appeared to be due to differences in their pharmacokinetics and the dosage schedule that was used. For amphotericin B there was a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo efficacy, but this was not true of the triazole derivatives. These results further demonstrate that, with the methods used in this study, in vitro susceptibility testing of triazoles may not be predictive of in vivo activity against isolates of H. capsulatum.\r"

None of the organisms were resistant to imipenem, minocycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, or daptomycin. The MICs of penicillin were in the moderately susceptible range for all but three strains. Susceptibility to the other agents varied by genus and, in some cases, by species. When disk diffusion results were compared with MICs for drugs recommended for streptococci by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Villanova, Pa., few very major or major errors were obtained, but the number of minor errors was 19.3%. Therefore, we recommended that MIC testing be used instead of disk diffusion testing for these organisms.\r"

  ".W": "Vancomycin-induced \"red man syndrome\" (RMS) is mediated in part by histamine release, and its severity is correlated with the area under the plasma histamine concentration-time curve. Ten adult male volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover trial (1-week washout interval between regimens) to determine the effect of 1- and 2-h infusions of vancomycin (1.0 g) on histamine release and on the frequency and severity of RMS. The severity of RMS was classified a priori as mild, moderate, or severe from a combined score of pruritus and extent of erythema. Serial concentrations of histamine in plasma and concentrations of vancomycin in serum were measured at baseline and during and after each infusion. Of 10 subjects, 8 had evidence of RMS during the 1-h infusion (3 mild, 3 moderate, and 2 severe), whereas only 3 of the 10 subjects (all mild) had RMS during the 2-h infusion (P less than 0.05). The 1-h infusion was associated with a significantly greater peak concentration of histamine in plasma (1.8 +/- 0.7 versus 1.0 +/- 0.3 ng/ml, P = 0.004) and a greater total release of histamine (74.3 +/- 54.1 versus 36.4 +/- 22.6 ng.min/ml, P = 0.017) than was the 2-h infusion. These data suggest that administration of vancomycin over 2 h reduces the frequency and severity of RMS and the amount of histamine released compared with those after a 1-h infusion in healthy volunteers.\r"

  ".W": "The antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin was compared with that of erythromycin in experimentally infected mice by whole-body autobacteriography. In mice with systemic staphylococcal infections, the number of vital microbes in the body was relatively low in the early period after oral administration of erythromycin, but increased thereafter to the levels found in nonmedicated control mice. On the other hand, with clarithromycin treatment, a significantly smaller number of microbes was evident throughout the body. The microbes were scarcely seen in the parenchyma of any organs during the examination period. This potent antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin compared with that of erythromycin was further demonstrated in mice with respiratory infections. On the other hand, to examine the distribution properties of both antibiotics in the whole body, an autoradiographic study was carried out with [N-methyl-14C]clarithromycin and [N-methyl-14C]erythromycin. Both labeled antibiotics were distributed widely throughout the body after oral administration in both uninfected control mice and mice with systemic infections. However, the radioactivity was more marked and persistent for [14C]clarithromycin than it was for [14C]erythromycin, particularly in the lungs. The observations described above indicate the superior in vivo antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin compared with that of erythromycin and suggest that the superiority of clarithromycin is largely attributed to its favorable distribution properties. The advantages of whole-body autobacteriography, coupled with whole-body autoradiography, are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, WIN 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. Agar inclusion and broth dilution in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the staphylococci. The MIC for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (MIC90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the MIC90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. Against enterococci the MIC90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group A and group B streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. In general, the MIC90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. Exceptions were Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). The greatest potency was observed against Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp., with MIC90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. Broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with MIC90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. The in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. With the exception of the Pseudomonas infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied the influence of LPS on the intracortical accumulation kinetics of gentamicin in rats infused intravenously for 6 h, during which time steady-state levels of the antibiotic in serum were achieved. We compared gentamicin accumulation rates (V) in normal rats and in rats receiving LPS (0.5 and 5 mg/kg) as levels in serum (S) varied from 0.5 to 130 micrograms/ml. The pharmacokinetic parameters of gentamicin were previously measured in the three groups of rats that were studied in order to reach and maintain in each rat the desired levels of antibiotic in serum during the 6 h of infusion. Two hours before the infusion of gentamicin, LPS was injected intravenously over a period of 15 min. In normal rats, the increase in S was associated with a nonlinear increase in V. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which was the best-fitting function, gave an apparent Vmax (maximal capacity of uptake) of 195.03 +/- 9.75 micrograms/g per h and an apparent Km (concentration in serum at Vmax/2, an index of affinity) of 34.91 +/- 4.45 micrograms/ml (linear transformation of the experimental data by the Hanes-Woolf plot: r = 0.93, n = 85). In the rats that received LPS, the increase in S was associated with a linear increase of V: for LPS at 0.5 mg/kg, V = 27.00 + 1.50 S (r = 0.94, n = 80); for LPS at 5 mg/kg, V = 22.72 + 1.48 S (r = 0.94, n = 75).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In vitro, the nikkomycins were found to be most effective against the highly chitinous, dimorphic fungi Coccidioides immitis and Blastomyces dermatitidis, were less effective against yeasts, and were virtually without effect on the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Additionally, by transmission electron microscopy, nikkomycin Z was highly disruptive to the cell wall and internal structure of the spherule-endospore phase of C. immitis in vitro. In vivo, nikkomycin Z was more effective than nikkomycin X, was also found to be superior on a milligram per milligram basis to the majority of azoles tested in the models of coccidioidomycosis and blastomycosis, and was moderately effective in histoplasmosis. A study of the pharmacokinetics in mice showed that nikkomycin Z was rapidly eliminated after intravenous infusion but that absorption after oral administration was sufficiently slow to allow inhibitory levels to persist for more than 2 h. Results of limited toxicology tests suggest that nikkomycin Z was well tolerated at the dosages employed.\r"

  ".W": "Some quinolone antibiotics cause increases in levels of theophylline in plasma that lead to serious adverse effects. We investigated the mechanism of this interaction by developing an in vitro system of human liver microsomes. Theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine) was incubated with human liver microsomes in the presence of enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, or ofloxacin. Theophylline, its demethylated metabolites (3-methylxanthine and 1-methylxanthine), and its hydroxylated metabolite (1,3-dimethyluric acid) were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and Km and Vmax values were estimated. Enoxacin and ciprofloxacin selectively blocked the two N demethylations; they significantly inhibited the hydroxylation only at high concentrations. Norfloxacin and ofloxacin caused little or no inhibition of the three metabolites at comparable concentrations. The extent of inhibition was reproducible in five different human livers. Inhibition enzyme kinetics revealed that enoxacin caused competitive and mixed competitive types of inhibition. The oxo metabolite of enoxacin caused little inhibition of theophylline metabolism and was much less potent than the parent compound. Nonspecific inhibition of cytochrome P-450 was ruled out since erythromycin N demethylation (cytochrome P-450 mediated) was unaffected in the presence of enoxacin. These in vitro data correlate with the clinical interaction described for these quinolones and theophylline. We conclude that some quinolones are potent and selective inhibitors of specific isozymes of human cytochrome P-450 that are responsible for theophylline metabolism. This in vitro system may be useful as a model to screen similar compounds for early identification of potential drug interactions.\r"

The Mcr phenotype was stably maintained in the progeny of all three MRSA clones carrying penicillinase plasmids. However, when the clones were tested after elimination of the plasmids, methicillin-susceptible (Mcs) subclones appeared at various frequencies. Seven Mcs subclones were classified into two groups based on their stabilities. Five Mcs subclones, which were derived from homogeneous strains MR108 and MR61, were stably susceptible. They lost penicillin-binding protein 2' production, and moreover, the mecA gene was deleted in four of five subclones. Two subclones were derived from heterogeneous strain MR6. They were very unstable, and more than half of their progeny were Mcr revertants. However, the remainder were stably Mcs and had lost penicillin-binding protein 2' and the mecA gene. We propose that penicillinase plasmids, which are present in most MRSA strains, play an important role in the stability and phenotypic expression of the mecA gene.\r"

Agar dilution MICs were determined by using 73 strains of Enterobacteriaceae that produced a single beta-lactamase that had been characterized and quantified and a beta-lactamase-negative control strain of Escherichia coli. For E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, MICs of each combination increased as levels of TEM, SHV-1, or class IV enzymes increased. However, the percentage of strains that were resistant was highest for ticarcillin-clavulanate (32%), with only 18 and 6% resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam, respectively. Strains producing PSE-1, regardless of level, were resistant or moderately susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate but were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam. HMS-1 and OHIO-1 beta-lactamases were associated with resistance to ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, respectively. High levels of class IV enzymes in Klebsiella oxytoca were associated with resistance to all three combinations. These results indicate that the level and type of beta-lactamase produced by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae are important determinants of susceptibility to beta-lactam-inhibitor combinations, especially ticarcillin-clavulanate.\r"

This indicates synergism in the therapeutic efficacy of the two agents. When the antimicrobial ability of peritoneal macrophages (M phi s) against M. fortuitum was measured in medium with or without ofloxacin, growth of the organisms was more markedly inhibited by ofloxacin in LC9018-induced M phi s than in normal M phi s. Synergism in the therapeutic activity of oxfloxacin plus LC9018 is assumed to be mediated in part by host M phi s, that is, functional stimulation of host M phi s by LC9018 treatment results in the synergistic effects of the two agents.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To demonstrate the magnitude, timing, and cause of changes in blood pressure that occur in migrants from a low blood pressure population on moving to an urban area. DESIGN--A controlled longitudinal observational study of migrants as soon after migration as possible and follow up at three, six, 12, 18, and 24 months after migration. A cohort of controls living in a rural area who were matched for age, sex, and locality were also observed at the same periods. SETTING--35 Villages on the northern shores of Lake Victoria in western Kenya and Nairobi. PARTICIPANTS--325 Members of the Luo tribe aged 15 to 34 years who had migrated to Nairobi and 267 controls living in villages. The numbers of both groups reduced during follow up such that only 63 migrants and 143 controls were followed up for two years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--A medical questionnaire and three 24 hour diet histories were completed by migrants and controls. Height, weight, pulse, and blood pressure were measured. Three 12 hour overnight urine samples were collected from all participants and analysed for sodium, potassium, and creatinine concentrations. RESULTS--The mean systolic blood pressure of migrants was significantly higher than that of controls throughout the study, and the distribution of blood pressure was shifted to the right compared with controls. The mean diastolic blood pressure of the two groups diverged over time. Blood pressure differences were not due to selective migration. The migrants' mean urinary sodium:potassium ratio was higher than that of controls (p less than 0.001) throughout, and weight and pulse rate were also higher among migrants, although differences diminished with time. CONCLUSIONS--Urinary sodium:potassium ratio, pulse rate, and weight are important predictors of increased blood pressure among migrants from a low blood pressure community and may also be implicated in the initiation of essential hypertension.\r"

DESIGN--Double blind parallel group trial of patients who were given placebo for six weeks and then randomly allocated to various doses of bendrofluazide (1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. SETTING--General practices in Zealand, Denmark. PATIENTS--257 Patients with newly diagnosed or previously treated hypertension, aged 25-70, who had a mean diastolic blood pressure of 100-120 mm Hg after receiving placebo for six weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Reduction in diastolic blood pressure and changes in biochemical variables (potassium, urate, glucose, fructosamine, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein A I, apolipoprotein B, and triglyceride concentrations). RESULTS--All doses of bendrofluazide significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure to the same degree (10-11 mm Hg). Clear relations between dose and effect were shown for potassium, urate, glucose, total cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B concentrations. The 1.25 mg dose increased only urate concentrations, whereas the 10 mg dose affected all the above biochemical variables. CONCLUSION--The relevant range of doses of bendrofluazide to treat mild to moderate hypertension is 1.25-2.5 mg a day. Higher doses caused more pronounced adverse biochemical effects including adverse lipid effects. Previous trials with bendrofluazide have used too high doses.\r"

SETTING--General practice centres in 22 Scottish districts. SUBJECTS--5123 Men and 5236 women aged 40-59 in the Scottish heart health study, randomly selected from 22 districts throughout Scotland, of whom 1262 men and 1061 women had hypertension (defined as receiving antihypertensive treatment or with blood pressure above defined cut off points). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Hypertension (assessed by standardised recording, questionnaire on diagnosis, and antihypertensive drug treatment) according to criteria of the World Health Organisation (receiving antihypertensive treatment or blood pressure greater than or equal to 160/95 mm Hg, or both) and to modified criteria of the British Hypertension Society. RESULTS--In half the men with blood pressure greater than or equal to 160/95 mm Hg hypertension was undetected (670/1262, 53%), in half of those in whom it had been detected it was untreated (250/592, 42%), and in half of those receiving treatment it was not controlled (172/342, 50%). In women the numbers were: 486/1061, 46%; 188/575, 33%; and 155/387, 40% respectively. Assessment of blood pressure according to the British Hypertension Society's recommendations showed an improvement, but in only a quarter of men and 42% of women was hypertension detected and treated satisfactorily (142/561, 215/514 respectively). IMPLICATIONS--The detection and control of hypertension in Scotland is unsatisfactory, affecting management of this and other conditions, such as high blood cholesterol concentration, whose measurement is opportunistic and selective and depends on recognition of other risk factors.\r"

SETTING--One urban general practice. SUBJECTS--34 Relatives of patients with terminal illnesses who died in 1987; five general practitioners from one practice. RESULTS--In six cases relatives were dissatisfied, mainly because of lack of communication; in eight cases doctors were dissatisfied because of communication, poor symptom control, and inadequate care. IMPLICATIONS--There is a need for improved communication between relatives and the health professionals involved in terminal care as well as better advice on services and benefits available to both patients and relatives. Bereavement counselling should be better organised.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To evaluate the medical impact of reactive pharmacy intervention. DESIGN--Analysis of all interventions during 28 days by all 35 pharmacists in hospitals in Nottingham. SETTING--All (six) hospitals in the Nottingham health authority (a teaching district), representing 2530 mainly acute beds, 781 mental illness beds, and 633 mainly health care of the elderly beds. PATIENTS--Hospital inpatients and outpatients. INTERVENTIONS--Recording of every important intervention made by pharmacists to prescriptions for both inpatients and outpatients when they perceived inadequacies of drug prescription or administration, including characterisation of the problem, coding of outcome, recording of time taken to initiate and resolve intervention, and grade of prescribing doctor. The problems were independently assessed for their potential to cause medical harm. RESULTS--769 Interventions (about 2.9% of prescriptions) were made, of which 60 concerned prescriptions rated as having a major potential for medical harm. The commonest problems concerned dosage, which was wrong in 280 prescriptions (102 for antibiotics) and not stated in 50 (one for antibiotics), especially those associated with a major potential for medical harm (32 prescriptions). These concerned sedatives; analgesics; cardiovascular drugs or diuretics; and iron, vitamin, or mineral preparations. Also common were overprolonged prescription of antibiotics (48 prescriptions), confusion of drug names (nine), and inadvertent coprescription of excessive quantities of aspirin or paracetamol in plain and compound preparations (seven). The pharmacist's recommendation was accepted in 639 instances (86%), and the prescription was altered in 575, leading to an appreciable (246 cases) or minor (231 cases) improvement. Interventions had little effect on costs; 427/646 had no effect and 130 produced savings less than 50p. Pharmacy intervention (730/769 interventions) occupied on average 41 minutes per pharmacist per week. CONCLUSIONS--Most reactive pharmacy interventions concerned prescribing errors with a limited potential for medical harm, but a small number of detected errors with a major potential for medical harm; cost savings were not appreciable.\r"

NHS staff at risk should be protected, and evidence of infectious tuberculosis should be sought as routine among certain prospective NHS employees, schoolteachers, and others. Contact tracing should be vigorously pursued, and all entrants to Britain from countries where tuberculosis is common should be screened. BCG vaccination should be offered in selected instances, and local organisation of tuberculosis services should be extended.\r"

DESIGN--Continuous observation of 472 hours of work performed by 12 preregistration house officers based in medical wards, using standard procedures for studying work patterns. SETTING--A teaching hospital with 340 beds assigned to general medicine and coronary care. SUBJECTS--12 Of the 16 preregistration house officers in medicine at the hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The hours, volume, and type of work undertaken by preregistration house officers in February 1989, as recorded by trained observers on a one to one basis. RESULTS--The hours of duty ranged from 83 to 101 hours each week, the longest period of continuous duty being 58 hours. Each shift, house officers spent up to 25 minutes travelling between wards and an average of 85 minutes treating patients in wards that were cross covered. Between 50% and 71% of house officers' time was spent on patient oriented duties during the day; this fell to between 21% and 53% at night. Each doctor spent an average of 40 minutes filing when off duty after 6 pm. CONCLUSIONS--Established procedures for studying workload were effective in monitoring doctors' hours, providing accurate information on the volume and type of work, which is essential to resolve the problems of medical staffing. The study showed that more house officers were needed and that the cross cover system should be stopped. As a result three extra preregistration house officers were appointed.\r"

DESIGN--A randomly selected population was personally invited for digital rectal examination by a urologist and a general practitioner. Further examinations were performed if induration was felt. Each man completed a questionnaire on his response to the examination. SETTING--General practices in the area of Norrkoping. PATIENTS--1494 Men aged 50-69 randomly selected from a population of 9026. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Prostates having a firm nodular consistency. RESULTS--Carcinoma of the prostate was suspected in 45 of 1163 patients examined; in 10 by the general practitioners, in 10 by the urologists, and in 25 by both. Forty four men had a fine needle aspiration biopsy, and carcinomas were found in 13 cases. Of these, one had been suspected by the general practitioner, four by urologists, and eight by both. The cost for each man was 11.60 pounds, and the cost for each case of carcinoma detected and treated by potentially curative methods was 2477 pounds. Of the 13 men with carcinoma, 10 underwent radical prostatectomy and one radiotherapy. One man had advanced disease and was given endocrine treatment, another was not treated. Only 193 men felt distress during the initial examination. Of the 44 men who had an aspiration biopsy, 25 experienced anxiety. CONCLUSIONS--Screening for carcinoma of the prostate by a urologist or a general practitioner using digital rectal examination is a cost effective method of early diagnosis. Whether such screening leads to prolonged survival, however, remains doubtful.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study the clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed diabetic patients in tropical Africa. DESIGN--Prospective study of all newly diagnosed diabetic patients registered at a major urban hospital between 1 June 1981 and 31 May 1987. SETTING--Muhimbili Medical Centre, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. PATIENTS--1250 Patients: 874 men, 376 women. RESULTS--272 (21.8%) Patients had diabetes requiring insulin, 825 (66.0%) had diabetes not requiring insulin, and 153 (12.2%) had diabetes of uncertain type. Most patients (1103, 88.2%) presented with the classic symptoms of diabetes. The peak time of presentation of diabetic patients requiring insulin was at age 15 to 19 years. Male manual workers and peasant farmers with diabetes not requiring insulin presented at a significantly older age and had a lower body mass index than sedentary office workers. Forty six (18.1%) of the patients requiring insulin diabetes and 111 (14.4%) not requiring insulin had first degree relative with diabetes. Twenty seven per cent of patients were underweight (body mass index less than 20 kg/m2) and 14.6% were obese (body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2). Hypertension was diagnosed in 211 (26.7%) of 791 patients not requiring insulin. Nine (3.3%) of those requiring insulin may have had the protein deficient type of diabetes related to malnutrition. The fibrocalculous variety of diabetes related to malnutrition was not observed. CONCLUSIONS--Newly presenting diabetic patients in Tanzania with diabetes requiring insulin are older at presentation than those in Britain; most diabetic patients present with diabetes not requiring insulin and a smaller proportion of Tanzanian patients are obese. Most have a lower socioeconomic state than diabetic patients in Britain. There are often delays in diagnosis in Tanzania, and there is a higher incidence of death shortly after presentation.\r"

  ".W": "The out of hours workload of a training practice in a suburban and semirural area on the south coast of England was studied for one year. An overall rate of contact of 273/1000 patients was found, which indicated a workload greater than that reported in most other studies. The duty doctor received over 35 telephone calls from patients during some Saturdays (1200 Saturday to 0800 Sunday) and Sundays (0800 to 0800 Monday), up to five being between 2300 and 0700. Of the patients who contacted a general practitioner, 44% were given advice by telephone and 4.9% were admitted to hospital. The admission rate was lower than that given in other studies. A considerable proportion of the workload arose from doctors covering the casualty department of a cottage hospital. Patients having a high expectation of 24 hour care by general practitioners in an area of comparative affluence (Jarman indices -13.8 to 1.7) may account for this aspect of the workload.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess attendance at and the characteristics of patients attending health checks for cardiovascular disease offered in a general practice over a period of five years (1984-9). DESIGN--Medical record audit and postal questionnaire survey. SETTING--One general practice in Oxfordshire with a socially diverse population. PARTICIPANTS--1101 Men and 1110 women aged 35-64 registered with the practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age, sex, marital state, social class, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and diet. RESULTS--Of the 2211 men and women in the target age group (35-64) in 1989, 1458 (65.9%) had been offered screening and 963 (43.6%) had attended for a health check. Attenders were more likely to be women, aged greater than or equal to 45, married, non-smokers, and of higher social class than patients who did not respond to the invitation. The relative likelihood of non-attendance was 1.24 for smokers, 1.20 for the overweight, 1.16 for heavy drinkers, and 1.28 for those with a less healthy diet, even after adjustment for age, sex, marital state, and social class. CONCLUSIONS--After five years of offering health checks, opportunistically (to men) and in the context of cervical smear tests (to women), less than half of the eligible patients had attended. The likelihood of acceptance of an invitation to attend was inversely related to the patient's cardiovascular risk for all factors measured except age. A coherent strategy to reduce cardiovascular disease depends on more careful targeting of scarce health service resources and more emphasis on public health measures (such as dietary regulation and tobacco taxation). Doctors should be careful not to absolve the government of its public health obligations by substituting unproved preventive interventions aimed at the individual patient.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested that a fetal blood lead level of 0.48 mumol/L (much lower than 1.21 mumol/L, which is the level previously believed to be toxic to the developing brain) may impair brain development permanently. We measured the maternal and umbilical cord blood levels of lead and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) among 95 consecutive mother-infant pairs to determine whether neonates in Toronto are in the high-risk group. There was a significant correlation between the maternal and the cord blood lead levels (r = 0.59, p less than 0.0001). Most (99%) of the infants had cord blood lead levels below 0.34 mumol/L; in 11 cases the levels were below the detection limit of 0.01 mumol/L. The cord blood FEP levels were higher than the maternal levels. The US Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, currently finds acceptable a blood FEP level of 0.62 mumol/L among children up to 10 years of age; however, this is not applicable to newborns since their higher FEP levels apparently reflect immature heme synthesis and increased erythrocyte volume rather than lead poisoning. Our data suggest that living in Toronto does not impose increased teratogenic risk from intrauterine exposure to lead; however, residents in high-risk areas should be followed up.\r"

The cine technique has been standardized over the years, both the camera and the display. Cine filming techniques, however, have not advanced, except for new film products with faster emulsions and better-quality films. Video electronic imaging has made rapid advancements. These were prompted by the broadcast industry when the requirements for color were developed in the 1960s and by the advent of new recording techniques that provided a very stable video time base from analog tape recorders. The medical field has been able to capitalize on these developments and to produce some of our own that have not been applied in the broadcast world. These include pulsed progressive 525-line video acquisition of cardiac images in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. We also have been able to capitalize on the improved detector technology that the broadcast world has developed, such as the plumbicon pickup tubes, which produce images with very little lag and so provide images with improved resolution. These developments also have enabled us to reduce radiation to both the patient and the laboratory personnel, especially with implementation of the pulsed progressive acquisition, with which the dose has been reduced 50%. With the advent of interventional procedures in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the need to assess images immediately cannot be fulfilled by cine filming because of the requirement for the processing of the film with its inherent delays. Quantification of cardiac structures is required to assess the outcome of interventional techniques.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were 129 women and 28 men aged 51 +/- 1 (range 13-87) yr. With PMV, mitral valve area increased from 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm2 to 2.0 +/- 0.1 cm2 (P less than .0001). Increase in mitral regurgitation (MR) occurred in 69 patients (44%). Patients were divided into two groups based on increase in MR after PMV. Group A (n = 136) had 0-1+ increase in MR. Group B (n = 20) had greater than or equal to 2+ increase in MR after PMV. The only predictor of increase in MR greater than or equal to 2+ was the ratio of effective balloon dilating area to body surface area (EBDA/BSA). EBDA/BSA was 4.0 +/- 0.1 cm2/m2 in Group A vs. 4.37 +/- 0.2 cm2/m2 in Group B (P = .02). Follow-up of patients in Group B showed: Four patients remained NYHA Class III and required mitral valve replacement 4.3 +/- 1.1 (range 5-21) mo after PMV. One patient who had undergone combined aortic and mitral valvotomy died in the hospital of worsening heart failure. One patient died 1 mo later of sepsis related to a dental abscess. Follow-up of the remaining 14 patients at 9.5 +/- 1.1 (range 2-7) mo showed 10 in NYHA Class I and four in NYHA Class II. Eight of 15 patients (53%) who had repeat left ventriculogram at 9.0 +/- 0.8 mo after PMV had a decrease in MR of one grade when compared to LVG immediately after PMV.\r"

Suggested indications were ejection fraction less than 25% and/or target vessels supplying greater than half of the viable myocardium. The data from 105 patients were entered into the Registry during 1988. This group included 30 patients who had dilation of their only patent coronary vessel and 20 patients whose disease was deemed too severe to undergo bypass surgery. Chest pain and ECG changes were uncommonly experienced during balloon inflation. The group experienced a high angioplasty success rate (95%) with an average of 1.7 dilatations per patient. Morbidity was frequently experienced, the majority of which was associated with cannula (18-20F) placement and/or removal. The overall hospital mortality was 7.6%, although half of the deaths occurred in patients who were both over 75 years of age and had left main coronary artery stenosis. Patients under the age of 75 years without left main coronary artery stenosis experienced a hospital mortality rate of 2.6%. Symptomatic improvement occurred in 91% of the patients surviving hospitalization. During the follow-up period of 1-12 months, three patients died of cardiac complications. This multicenter experience suggests that supported angioplasty can be performed safely in high-risk patients in several high-risk subgroups with the expectation of good symptomatic improvement and short-term survival.\r"

However, the morphological effects of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty are unknown. Therefore, the goals of the present study were to evaluate 1) the angiographic and histologic effects of laser thermal recanalization followed by balloon angioplasty and 2) the hypothesis that balloon-catheter-induced neointimal fracture could be sealed by subsequent laser thermal angioplasty in an experimental rabbit iliac artery atherosclerotic model. In Group 1 (7 vessels), a 1.5 mm metal capped argon laser fiberoptic was introduced via femoral arteriotomy and 10 W of thermal power was applied to the iliac artery stenosis for 5 sec while maintaining constant back-and-forth motion. Thereafter, balloon angioplasty was performed in the same vessel segment with a 2.5 mm balloon catheter inflated 3 times at 5 atm for 30 sec each. Mean angiographic luminal diameter increased from 1.1 mm to 2.0 mm after both procedures, and mean final post balloon dissection grade was 0.6 on a scale of 0, 1+, and 2+. Perforation occurred once with the laser probe and once with the balloon catheter. Histologic examination of these vessels was characterized by irregular thermal erosions with minimal reactive thrombosis. In Group 2 (10 vessels), the sequence was reversed, with laser thermal angioplasty following balloon dilation. Mean angiographic luminal diameter improved from 1.2 mm to 1.8 mm after both procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During normal arterial perfusion, verapamil (0.5 microM, free [Ca2+]o = 1.0 mM) and hypocalcemic blood perfusate (free [Ca2+]o = 0.4 mM) reduced the maximal isometric twitch tension by 48% and 78%, depolarized the resting membrane by +3 and +7 mV, decreased the extracellular longitudinal resistance (ro) by 15% and 26%, and increased conduction velocity by 4% and 6%, respectively. The changes in conduction velocity during these interventions were consistent with those predicted by linear cable theory (+3% and +9%) for the observed changes in ro. In contrast, verapamil shortened whereas a reduced [Ca2+]o lengthened action potential duration. Comparison of simultaneously measured longitudinal whole tissue resistance (rt), intracellular longitudinal resistance (ri), [K+]o, and resting tension during ischemia showed a close association between abrupt cell-to-cell electrical uncoupling, development of ischemic contracture, and the secondary rise of [K+]o, which all started to develop after approximately 15 minutes of ischemia. Electrical cell-to-cell uncoupling was completed within 15 minutes. In the presence of verapamil, the relation among the onset of electrical cell-to-cell uncoupling, secondary rise of [K+]o, and onset of ischemic contracture in ischemia was qualitatively the same as in its absence; however, these events were postponed by approximately 10 minutes, and the rates of contracture development and uncoupling were diminished. Conduction velocity decreased after 12 minutes of ischemia from 54 to 36 cm/sec in the absence of and from 61 to 46 cm/sec in the presence of verapamil. This slowing effect on impulse conduction could not be attributed to changes of electrical cell-to-cell coupling because at this time an increase in ri had not yet taken place. In the presence of a reduced [Ca2+]o, the resting tension and ri increased almost immediately after the onset of ischemia. Although the resting tension rose progressively throughout the course of ischemia, the ri showed a biphasic increase characterized by an early transient increase that reached a peak at 8 minutes (+87%) and a second, irreversible increase beginning at approximately 12 minutes. This final onset of electrical cell-to-cell uncoupling and the secondary rise of [K+]o were not different from the findings with a normal [Ca2+]o.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) stimulates the rate and force of cardiac contraction. However, the molecular mechanisms of 5-HT actions on the heart are unknown. We examined effects of 5-HT on phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and its regulation in cultured fetal mouse ventricular myocytes labeled with [3H]inositol. Accumulation of inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate was assessed after stimulation with 5-HT, catecholamines, and AlF4-. Inositol bisphosphate and trisphosphate reached a peak at 15 minutes by 5-HT stimulation and at 30 minutes by AlF4- stimulation. Inositol monophosphate accumulated linearly for at least 30 minutes in the presence of LiCl. The 5-HT effect was dose dependent, and the threshold concentration was 0.1 microM with the half-maximum effective concentration of 1 microM. Ketanserin in nanomolar concentrations inhibited the phospholipase C reaction by 100 microM 5-HT with the half-maximum inhibitory concentration of 0.5 nM. Pertussis toxin (100-1,000 ng/ml) did not influence the phospholipase C reaction by 5-HT, but it partially inhibited the reaction by AlF4-. Protein kinase C-activating phorbol esters like 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, but not 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, which is inactive for protein kinase C, completely inhibited the reaction by 5-HT; TPA showed 30% inhibition on the reaction by AlF4-. The magnitude of accumulated inositol phosphates by AlF4- was at least several times greater than that by 5-HT. Norepinephrine- and epinephrine-stimulated phospholipase C reactions were completely abolished by prazosin. These results suggest that 5-HT directly stimulates phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides through 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT2) receptors in the ventricular myocytes and that this reaction is negatively regulated by protein kinase C. 5-HT2 receptors may be coupled to phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-insensitive GTP-binding protein in the myocytes.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined firing patterns of single-fiber carotid baroreceptors in response to slow ramp increases in carotid sinus pressure (1-2 mm Hg/sec) in vascularly isolated carotid sinus preparations in thiopental-anesthetized dogs (25 mg/kg, plus 10 mg/kg/hr). Two general types of baroreceptor discharge patterns were obtained: 1) type I, a discontinuous, hyperbolic pattern characterized by a sudden onset of discharge at threshold pressure with a relatively high threshold frequency, which gradually increased to a higher saturation firing rate and 2) type II, a continuous, sigmoidal pattern characterized by a gradual increase in discharge above threshold pressure and a relatively low threshold frequency and saturation firing rate. Type II baroreceptor curves typically showed spontaneous discharge below threshold pressure and significantly lower sensitivities, threshold frequency, saturation firing rate, and threshold pressure than those of type I receptors. However, the saturation pressures and operating ranges of the type II receptors were greater than those of type I receptors, and the pressure at which type II receptors had their greatest sensitivity was greater than that for type I receptors. Type I baroreceptors generally had large myelinated afferent A fibers; type II baroreceptors generally had smaller A and unmyelinated C fibers, based on conduction velocities. The presence of spontaneous activity with type II baroreceptors, combined with significantly lower sensitivities and wider pressure operating ranges seen relative to type I baroreceptors, suggests that these receptors may primarily serve to provide information on tonic, or baseline, levels of arterial blood pressure to the central cardiovascular centers. The sudden onset of discharge, higher sensitivities, and narrower operating ranges of type I baroreceptors suggest that their primary role may be to provide information on dynamic, sudden changes in arterial pressure.\r"

In one class of baroreceptors (type I), which did not fire spontaneously below the pressure threshold (Pth), 4-AP (10(-5) to 10(-4) M) decreased Pth in a dose-dependent manner and transformed the stimulus-response relation from a discontinuous, hyperbolic shape to a sigmoidal, continuous curve. After exposure to 10(-4) M of 4-AP, baroreceptors were spontaneously active below Pth. These effects of 4-AP were more pronounced in baroreceptors with a high control Pth and were independent of enhanced neurotransmitter release or changes in carotid sinus distensibility. In contrast, 4-AP had relatively little effect on type II baroreceptors, which under control conditions are characterized by a continuous, sigmoidal stimulus-response curve. We believe that these effects of 4-AP on baroreceptor discharge were mediated by blockade of a transient K+ conductance that was present at the receptor spike-initiation zone. This hypothesis was examined using a mathematical model based on the Hodgkin-Huxley axon, but modified to include the transient K+ conductance. The modeling results showed that the minimum current necessary to elicit action potential firing is an extremely sensitive function of the magnitude of this K+ conductance, supporting our experimental results obtained with 4-AP. Our findings suggest that a transient K+ conductance might play a role in the determination of Pth and that differences between type I and II receptors could be the result of differences in the effectiveness of this conductance in controlling spike-initiation zone excitability.\r"

In an effort to define the mechanisms involved, we determined the effects of 3 and 7 days of hypoxia on adenylate cyclase activity and beta-adrenergic receptor binding characteristics in pulmonary and systemic arteries in an adult rat model of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction produced by hypobaria. Basal and stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were measured in crude membrane preparations by radioimmunoassay for cyclic AMP. Basal enzyme activity in pulmonary arteries did not change with hypoxia, whereas in systemic arteries it increased 3.5- and 5.3-fold following 3 and 7 days of hypoxia, respectively. GTP-stimulated activity in pulmonary arteries also did not change, but in systemic arteries it increased 7.1- and 5.5-fold. Isoproterenol-stimulated activity in pulmonary arteries was decreased to 49% of control-stimulated activity following 3 days but was similar to control-stimulated activity after 7 days of hypoxia; in systemic arteries it increased 5.6- and 4.6-fold. Sodium fluoride-stimulated activity in pulmonary arteries was unchanged, whereas in systemic arteries it increased 3.8- and 5.3-fold. In contrast, forskolin-stimulated activity, which also was not altered in pulmonary arteries, was increased by only 85% and 71% in systemic arteries. beta-Adrenergic receptors were studied with [125I]iodocyanopindolol. Seven days of hypoxia decreased receptor density by 37% and 57% in the pulmonary and systemic arteries, respectively. Receptor affinity for agonists was not altered. Thus, despite downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in both artery types, prolonged hypoxia has no sustained effect on adenylate cyclase activity in pulmonary arteries, whereas enzyme activity in systemic arteries is markedly increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We recorded simultaneously from 120 bipolar electrodes on 40 plunge needles in a 20 x 35 x 5-mm volume of tissue of the right ventricular outflow tract immediately before and after shocks of 190-350 V were given via electrodes on the right atrium and left ventricular apex to six open-chest dogs with electrically induced ventricular fibrillation. For 20 shocks approximately 100 V below the defibrillation threshold, the site of earliest recorded activation following the shock was near the center of the mapped region. At the earliest recorded activation sites, there was an isoelectric window in the immediate postshock period lasting 42 +/- 15 msec after which activation fronts either spread away from a site in all directions in a focal pattern (12 episodes) or else spread away in only one direction (eight episodes). Comparison of activation patterns immediately before and after the shock revealed that in 18 of the 20 episodes, the location and pathway of activation fronts after the shock were markedly different from those before the shock. The preshock intervals at the sites of earliest activation following the shock, that is, the interval between the last activation at the site and the time of the shock, were not randomly distributed but were similar, averaging 64 +/- 11 msec, and were negatively correlated with the isoelectric postshock window (r = -0.70, p = 0.0001). These findings indicate that the presence and the site of origin of activation fronts after the shock are influenced by at least two factors: the shock itself and the electrophysiological state of the myocardium at the time of the shock. Thus, epicardial shocks approximately 100 V below the defibrillation threshold markedly alter the activation sequences of fibrillation but are unsuccessful because the activation fronts following the shock reinitiate fibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "A specific difference-spectrophotometric method was used to measure nitric oxide (NO) release into the coronary effluent perfusate of isolated, constant-flow-perfused guinea pig hearts. Authentic NO applied into the coronary circulation decreased vascular resistance dose dependently and enhanced coronary release of cyclic GMP (cGMP) fivefold. Increasing oxygen tension in aqueous solutions from 150 to 700 mm Hg decreased NO half-life (5.6 seconds) by 32%. During single passage through the intact coronary system, 86% of the infused NO was converted to nitrite ions. Oxidation of NO was more than 30 times faster within the heart than in aqueous solution. Endogenously formed NO was constantly released into the coronary effluent perfusate at a rate of 161 +/- 11 pmol/min. The NO scavenger oxyhemoglobin and methylene blue increased coronary resistance and decreased cGMP release (basal release, 342 +/- 4 fmol/min), whereas superoxide dismutase reduced coronary resistance. L-Arginine (10(-5) M) slightly decreased coronary perfusion pressure and enhanced release of cGMP. NG-Monomethyl L-arginine (10(-4) M) reduced basal release of NO and cGMP by 26% and 31%, respectively, paralleled by a coronary vasoconstriction. Bradykinin in the physiological range from 5 x 10(-11) M to 10(-7) M dilated coronary resistance vessels, which was paralleled by the release of NO and cGMP. Onset of NO release preceded onset of coronary vasodilation in all cases. Upon stimulation with bradykinin, amounts of endogenously formed NO were within the same range as the dose-response curves for exogenously applied NO both for changes in coronary resistance and cGMP release. Acetylcholine (10(-5) M), ATP (10(-5) M), and serotonin (10(-8) M) increased the rate of NO and cGMP release, resulting in coronary vasodilation. Our data suggest the following: 1) NO, the most rapidly acting vasodilator presently known, is metabolized within the heart mainly to nitrite and exhibits a half-life of only 0.1 second; 2) in the unstimulated heart, basal formation of NO may play an important role in setting the resting tone of coronary resistance vessels; 3) the kinetics and quantities of NO formation suggest that NO is causally involved in the bradykinin-induced coronary vasodilation; and 4) amounts of NO formed within the heart stimulated with ATP, acetylcholine, and serotonin are effective for vasodilation.\r"

Therefore, to maintain blood pressure, muscle vasodilation must be opposed by sympathetic vasoconstriction. The primary neural signal that increases sympathetic outflow is unclear. In an effort to isolate the vasoconstricting mechanism that opposes vasodilation, we measured the peak forearm vascular conductance response after the release of 10 minutes of forearm circulatory arrest under five separate study conditions: 1) no leg exercise, 2) low-level supine leg exercise, 3) low-level supine leg exercise with leg circulatory arrest after exercise, 4) high-level supine leg exercise, and 5) high-level supine leg exercise with leg circulatory arrest after exercise. We found that both high-workload conditions reduced peak forearm conductance below the no-leg exercise condition (a 34% reduction during leg exercise and a 52% reduction during leg exercise followed by leg circulatory arrest). In addition, at each workload, leg circulatory arrest after exercise, which isolated the skeletal muscle metaboreceptor contribution to vasoconstriction, reduced forearm conductance by approximately 20% below the values noted for leg exercise alone (combined central command and metaboreceptor stimulation). In a separate group of subjects, peak forearm blood flow was measured during lower-body negative pressure to levels up to -40 mm Hg, a maneuver that unloads high- and low-pressure baroreceptors. This intervention did not affect peak forearm blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood pressure and the degree of cardiac hypertrophy were decreased by castration and increased by testosterone substitution. We found the same relative distributions of MHC isoforms on the protein level (investigated by pyrophosphate electrophoresis) and on the messenger RNA level (investigated by the polymerase chain reaction). Castration favored the expression of the beta-MHC form, and testosterone substitution enhanced the expression of the alpha-MHC form. These effects were more pronounced in 8-week-old than in 14-16-week-old animals. We conclude that testosterone regulates cardiac MHC expression on a pretranslational level. This regulation is independent of hemodynamic load or cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

Chronic treatment of neonates with guanethidine was used to permanently destroy the sympathetic nerves. In the young treated animals, 33-54% of the neuropeptide Y remained in the heart despite a 90-99% reduction in norepinephrine; these proportions did not change in the animals that were allowed to develop to adulthood. The level of neuropeptide Y in the right atrium of young animals was unexpectedly high (252 +/- 28.7 pmol/g) compared with adults (75.4 +/- 18.8 pmol/g). The coronary arteries in the control rats received a moderately dense supply of neuropeptide Y-containing nerves; after guanethidine, all neuropeptide Y-containing nerves innervating the large coronary arteries disappeared, but some were still seen in association with small resistance vessels. No compensatory proliferation of the intrinsic neuropeptide Y-containing neurons occurred in the adult sympathectomized animals, and the intrinsic nerves did not reinnervate the large coronary arteries. These results are discussed in relation to the clinical syndrome of coronary artery spasm.\r"

(-)Norepinephrine produced stimulation predominantly through beta 1-receptors and (-)epinephrine through both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors. However, there were marked differences in the responses of tissues from patients treated with the beta 1-selective antagonist atenolol compared with non-beta-blocker-treated patients; surprisingly, beta 2-mediated responses were enhanced, and beta 1-mediated responses were unaltered. There was an enhanced responsiveness to (-)epinephrine (atenolol treated: -log M EC50, 7.57 +/- 0.07; non-beta-blocker treated: -log M EC50, 6.77 +/- 0.17; p less than 0.001), and the relative importance of beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation was increased for both (-)norepinephrine and (-)epinephrine. In tissues from atenolol-treated patients, salbutamol, a beta 2-selective partial agonist, had an enhanced potency and a greater intrinsic activity (atenolol treated: -log M EC50, 7.13 +/- 0.09; intrinsic activity, 0.86 +/- 0.04; non-beta-blocker treated: -log M EC50, 5.76 +/- 0.44; intrinsic activity, 0.39 +/- 0.13). We investigated possible mechanisms underlying the enhanced responsiveness to beta 2 stimulation. Determination of beta 2-adrenoceptor affinity for salbutamol showed no change of affinity in atenolol-treated patients. Responses of the tissues to the cyclic AMP analogue dibutyryl cyclic AMP were not different between atenolol-treated and non-beta-blocker-treated patients. The results suggest that chronic blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors causes enhanced coupling of beta 2-adrenoceptors to adenylate cyclase or to other mechanisms leading to increased contractile force.\r"

Wall shear stress is known to influence endothelial cell function and may play a role in atherogenesis, but its magnitude and distribution in the circulation are not well understood. To simulate arterial wall motion, we used both straight and curved rubber tubing models in a mock circulatory system incorporating a variable impedance element distal to the model aorta. Wall shear rate was measured with a hot-film anemometer probe mounted flush on the tubing wall and free to move with the wall. Wall shear stress was determined as the product of wall shear rate and viscosity. By changing the distal impedance element, we determined the influence of the (temporal) phase angle between pressure and flow, or equivalently, tube diameter and flow, on wall shear stress. We observed a fivefold increase in peak wall shear stress and the onset of intense wall shear stress reversal sinusoidal flows as the phase angle between pressure and flow was reduced from -60 degrees to -80 degrees. Wall shear stresses were insensitive to this same phase angle when its value was between -10 degrees and -60 degrees. Theoretical predictions, also presented here, are in accord with these observations. The phenomena we have observed in elastic tubes may be important in the arterial system because the phase angle between the first harmonic of pressure and flow in the aorta of humans is usually near our sensitive range. This same phase angle becomes more negative in hypertensive patients and is influenced by vasoactive drugs.\r"

We used verapamil to examine the effect of calcium entry blockade on microvascular transport of macromolecules in ischemia-reperfusion injury. The rat cremaster muscle was splayed, placed in a Lucite intravital chamber, and suffused with bicarbonate buffer. The clearance of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran (FITC-dextran 150) was measured as an index of microvascular transport. After determination of baseline data (clearance of FITC-dextran 150, 3.0 +/- 0.5 microliters/5 min/g), the muscle was made ischemic for 2 hours by clamping its vascular pedicle and subsequently was reperfused for 2 hours. Ischemia-reperfusion produced a marked increase in FITC-dextran clearance. After a peak of 12 +/- 2-fold increase observed in the first 15 minutes into reperfusion, FITC-dextran 150 clearance decreased in magnitude and stabilized at about sixfold above baseline. Verapamil did not change the baseline clearance values. Importantly, verapamil inhibited the ischemia-induced increase in clearance and maintained the values at or near the baseline levels. We simultaneously determined the rate of release of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) into the suffusate. Verapamil decreased the baseline values of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and increased those of TXB2. Verapamil inhibited the ischemia-reperfusion-induced increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha but did not alter the effect of ischemia-reperfusion on TXB2. Our main results demonstrate the effectiveness of verapamil in preventing microvascular alterations leading to increased leakage of macromolecules.\r"

  ".U": "90263248\r", 
  ".W": "Our previous studies have identified that adrenergic regulation of large arterioles and venules in skeletal muscle uses both postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, whereas terminal arterioles appear to be subserved primarily by alpha 2-receptors. Adrenergic constriction of terminal arterioles is known to be particularly susceptible to inhibition by increased tissue metabolic rate. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of tissue acidosis on alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor constriction of skeletal muscle microvessels to determine if this differential receptor distribution might have significance in neural-metabolic interactions. Intravital microscopy of rat cremaster skeletal muscle was used to obtain concentration-response curves (diameter changes) of large distributing arterioles (mean diameter, 100 microns), small precapillary arterioles (20 microns), and capacitance venules (150 microns) for addition to the tissue bath of alpha-adrenergic agonists during normal pH (7.4) and during tissue bath acidosis (pH 7.1) produced by increasing bath PCO2. The following alpha-agonists were used: phenylephrine (alpha 1), B-HT 933 (alpha 2), and norepinephrine (mixed alpha 1/alpha 2). Acidosis had no effect on baseline diameter of the three vessel types, indicating a lack of effect on \"intrinsic tone.\" Acidosis also had no effect on large microvessel sensitivity to phenylephrine but markedly reduced responses to B-HT 933. Acidosis had no effect on large arteriolar and venular sensitivity to norepinephrine but markedly decreased (x300) small precapillary arteriolar sensitivity. These data suggest that 1) alpha 2- but not alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated constriction of microvessels may be selectively sensitive to modest reductions in tissue pH, and 2) the prevalence of alpha 2-receptors on terminal arterioles and the marked sensitivity of alpha 2 constriction to tissue acidosis may contribute to the particular susceptibility of neural constriction at this level of the microcirculation to metabolic inhibition.\r"

The existence of stable high amplitude oscillations was evidenced between two Hopf bifurcation points (HB). Near each HB, a zone of bistability was detected. Close to the HB that corresponded to high values of Qit1, a high amplitude periodic stable state coexisted with a stable steady state. Close to the other HB, in a narrow range of lower Qit1 values, a relatively high amplitude periodic stable state coexisted with a low amplitude periodic stable state. There was no stable steady state in the latter bistability zone. Through the use of phase-plane representations and the determination of separatrices between the different attractor basins, we could deduce the conditions of timing, polarity, and strength needed for a pulse perturbation to send the system from one state to another and vice versa. The YNI model was analyzed by numerical simulation, and the oscillatory behavior of the sinoatrial node cell was explored while applying a depolarizing bias current of various strengths. Results were similar to those obtained from the VCD model in that there were two bistability regions for two different ranges of applied bias current. Depending on current intensity, annihilation of pacemaker activity could be achieved in both zones. However, the coexistence of two oscillatory stable states was never observed in the YNI model. From the behavioral similarities of these different models, we can conclude that bistabilities and annihilation phenomena can be found in transitional zones between quiescence and rhythmic activity.\r"

  ".W": "Power spectra of epicardial electrograms were studied in 13 anesthetized dogs subjected to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Electrograms were obtained from a bipolar electrode placed on the epicardial surface of the left ventricle and recorded before and after coronary occlusion. After digitization, power spectra of the first and every 50th subsequent waveform were evaluated and compared with the power spectrum of the average waveform obtained from the baseline recording. In particular, we examined variations in relative power content in three frequency ranges: 150-250 Hz, previously shown to be directly affected by myocardial ischemia; 40-150 Hz, presumably corresponding to the fine notches and slurs on the body surface QRS; and 2-40 Hz, the low-frequency range. Apart from a mild initial rise during the first 50 heart beats, the power in the high-frequency range gradually decreased, reaching 5% of the control value at wave 500. The power in the mid-frequency range showed a monotonous decrease after the occlusion and reached 16% of the control. The power in the low-frequency range showed a gradual buildup to 140% of the control after 500 heart beats. Therefore, ischemia causes a shift of the high-frequency spectral components of the local electrographic waveform to lower frequencies. Our findings and the fact that body surface ECG is produced by spatial summation of local electric potentials over the different regions of the myocardial tissue may explain two previously described effects of acute myocardial ischemia on the body surface ECG complex. First, local loss of spectral components in the range 150-250 Hz may produce a zone of reduced amplitude within a QRS complex band-pass filtered in this range. Second, displacement of power in the frequency domain may suggest an explanation to the increased incidence of visible notches and slurs on the surface QRS complex, characteristic to various myocardial pathologies.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effect of hyperpressure on the transport of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and albumin in the arterial wall, we measured in vitro the uptake of both iodine-131-labeled LDL and iodine-125-labeled albumin in intact rabbit thoracic aorta, held at in vivo length and pressurized to 70 or 160 mm Hg. Arteries were incubated for 2 hours (n = 8) at 70 mm Hg, and for 5 minutes (n = 4), 30 minutes (n = 4), 1 hour (n = 5), and 2 hours (n = 5) at 160 mm Hg. The transmural distribution of the relative concentrations of LDL (CLDL) and albumin (Calb) across the wall was determined by using a serial frozen sectioning technique. At 70 mm Hg, the mean medial CLDL and Calb values were 0.0018 +/- 0.0007 and 0.0039 +/- 0.0013, respectively. At 160 mm Hg, CLDL and Calb were markedly increased. The distribution of labeled albumin was almost uniform across the media and reached a steady state after 30 minutes, whereas labeled LDL accumulated in the first inner layers, a steady state being achieved after 1 hour. The 1-hour values of CLDL in the first and second luminal sections (0.24 +/- 0.03 and 0.13 +/- 0.05, respectively) were much higher than those of Calb, the CLDL/Calb ratios being 4.12 +/- 0.94 and 2.34 +/- 0.42 (p less than 0.01), respectively. In the subsequent sections, the CLDL decreased markedly and became much lower than the Calb, the CLDL/Calb ratio averaging 0.2 in the two-thirds outer media. To investigate whether LDL was trapped at high pressure in the inner layers, vessels were exposed to a tracer-free intraluminal solution for 30 minutes, after a 30-minute incubation with tracers. After washout, albumin was almost totally removed from the wall, while the CLDL were practically unchanged. Compaction of the media induced by high distending stresses applied to the vessel might have hindered the efflux of LDL, whereas albumin moved freely through the wall. Synergy between increased endothelial permeability and compaction of the media together with enhanced pressure-driven convection might account for the marked increase in LDL concentration observed in the inner wall at high pressure.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effect of selective alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenergic blockade on the myocardial contractile and chronotropic response to exercise, 29 dogs were chronically instrumented with a sonomicrometer for measuring myocardial wall thickness and a micromanometer for measuring left ventricular pressure. During treadmill exercise, either the selective alpha 1-blocker prazosin (80 micrograms/kg, n = 12) or the alpha 2-blocker idazoxan (80 micrograms/kg, n = 8) was infused into the left atrium beginning 2-3 minutes after the onset of exercise. alpha 1-Adrenoceptor blockade, like alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade, was found to cause significant increases in systolic wall thickening, thickening velocity, heart rate, and left ventricular contractility, indicating an increase in inotropic state that was comparable to that with alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade. Preventing the decrease in aortic blood pressure after selective alpha 1-blockade by using either systemic angiotensin II infusion (n = 6) or inflation of an intra-aortic balloon (n = 6) did not prevent the observed increases in wall thickening, heart rate, and left ventricular contractility. In four of the dogs treated with prazosin, the norepinephrine concentration in the coronary sinus was found to more than double after alpha 1-blockade. beta-Adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 1.0 mg/kg) prevented the increased contractile and chronotropic state caused by alpha 1- or alpha 2-blockade. Selective alpha-adrenergic blockade during adrenergic activation by intravenous norepinephrine infusion, in contrast to exercise, had no effect on wall thickening, heart rate, or left ventricular contractility. These data indicate that selective alpha 1-adrenergic blockade, like selective alpha 2-adrenergic blockade, causes a significant augmentation of heart rate and left ventricular contractility in the dog during dynamic exercise. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that this occurs through a presynaptic disinhibition of neural norepinephrine release mediated by a prejunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptor.\r"

During reperfusion, two series of measurements were made with various substances topically applied to the extraluminal surface. In the first series, reduced nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) was extracted from tissue and measured spectrophotometrically, as an index of oxidative damage. In the second series, mucosal and serosal surface pH was measured as an index of the functional ability to maintain ion gradients. In control conditions, NBT deposition averaged 55-63 micrograms/g tissue. After 60 and 120 minutes of reperfusion, NBT was elevated to 446-479 micrograms/g, which was approximately half as large as the NBT increment (846 micrograms/g) produced by a 15-minute application of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase to well-perfused tissue. As expected, NBT levels were significantly lower (299 micrograms/g) in tissue that was continuously suffused with superoxide dismutase (SOD) plus catalase (CAT) before occlusion and during reperfusion. Similar NBT levels (274 micrograms/g) were observed after reperfusion in animals that were fed a diet supplemented with the antioxidant vitamin E for 4-6 weeks. These observations affirm that some, but not all, NBT deposition after reperfusion can be attributed to oxyradicals. However, with exogenous adenosine (ADO) applied for the first 30 minutes after occlusion, NBT was elevated to 174 micrograms/g after 60 minutes, which was only half as large as the increment with SOD plus CAT, even though those substances were continuously applied. The opposite effect was produced by an ADO receptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline; NBT was increased to 516 micrograms/g.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading in humans results in nonuniform activation of the sympathetic nervous system. We reasoned that simultaneous measurements of arterial and venous norepinephrine (NE) spillover and clearance (using NE kinetics), muscle sympathetic neural activity (using microneurography), forearm blood flow (using plethysmography), and skin blood flow (using laser Doppler velocimetry) during lower body negative pressure at -15 mm Hg would isolate the location and extent of cardiopulmonary baroreceptor-mediated sympathetic nervous system activation. We exposed normal subjects (n = 8) to lower body negative pressure for 30 minutes, with measurements obtained at baseline, 5-10 minutes (EARLY), and 25-30 minutes (LATE). We found that arterial NE spillover, reflecting systemic sympathetic nervous system activation, did not increase significantly, whereas arterial NE clearance decreased significantly. In contrast, forearm venous NE spillover, reflecting skin and muscle sympathetic nervous system activation, increased by 17% and muscle sympathetic neural activity by 35% EARLY, whereas venous clearance did not change significantly. Although laser Doppler skin blood flow did not change, plethysmographic forearm blood flow (combined muscle and skin blood flow) decreased by 28%. All changes were sustained throughout 30 minutes of lower body negative pressure. Our data suggest that sympathetic vasoconstriction to muscle is greater than it is to skin in response to cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading. Moreover, our data suggest that reduced NE clearance in the arterial circulation is the primary mechanism by which arterial NE concentrations rise. Conversely, NE spillover appears to be the primary mechanism responsible for increasing venous NE concentrations measured from the forearm during cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading.\r"

Vascular responses to the thromboxane analogue U46619 were measured in four separate experimental protocols: 1) The vascular responses were measured in the presence and absence of intact endothelium to examine the role of endothelium-derived vasodilators. 2) Responses were measured in the presence of intact endothelium before and after inhibition of cyclooxygenase with indomethacin to examine the role of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle-derived prostaglandins. 3) Responses were measured after endothelial removal before and after indomethacin to examine the role of vascular smooth muscle-derived prostaglandins. 4) Responses were measured after indomethacin and before and after removal of endothelium to examine the role of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. In anesthetized dogs (n = 41) that underwent constant pressure perfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), LAD diameter was measured with sonomicrometer crystals, and coronary flow was measured with an electromagnetic flow probe. Intracoronary infusion of U46619 (0.01-1.0 microgram/min) produced a dose-dependent constriction of LAD. Constriction of the LAD was augmented after endothelial removal, after indomethacin treatment in both the presence and absence of endothelium, and after removal of the endothelium in the presence of indomethacin. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis had the greatest effect of augmenting constriction of LAD to thromboxane. Coronary flow was decreased by U46619 only in the presence of indomethacin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After a control injection of tracers, NFI was induced for 30-60 minutes. After coronary reflow, repeat tracer injections were given at early RPF (5-15 minutes of RPF) and late RPF (40-60 minutes of RPF). After NFI-RPF, maximal fractional extraction and capillary permeability-surface area product increased for sestamibi (from +39% to 69%) and decreased for thallium (from -14% to -68%). Net extraction was 33% lower for sestamibi than for thallium at control, 13% lower at early RPF, and 90% higher than thallium at late RPF. Interstitial-myocyte exchange estimates were always higher for sestamibi than for thallium and increased for both with NFI-RPF (sestamibi, from 57.4 to 122.4 ml/min/g; thallium, from 3.1 to 22.3 ml/min/g). Intramyocyte volumes of distribution were higher for sestamibi than for thallium (greater than 200% at control, 800-1,000% with RPF), and NFI-RPF had opposite effects on the two tracers (late RPF vs. control: +28% for sestamibi, -50% for thallium). Our results suggest that sestamibi and thallium have different transport or sequestering mechanisms and that NFI-RPF had opposite effects on myocardial capillary-tissue exchange and tissue retention of sestamibi and thallium. Therefore, myocardial perfusion might be overestimated with sestamibi and underestimated with thallium during early RPF.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine effects of aging on the mechanics and composition of cerebral arterioles. We measured pressure (servo-null) and diameter in pial arterioles in anesthetized adult (9-12 months old) and aged (24-27 months old) Fischer 344 rats. After deactivation of smooth muscle with EDTA, diameter of pial arterioles at 70 mm Hg pial arteriolar pressure was less in aged than in adult rats (67 +/- 4 vs. 81 +/- 4 microns [mean +/- SEM], p less than 0.05). The stress-strain relation and the slope of tangential elastic modulus versus stress (6.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.3, p less than 0.05) indicated that distensibility of pial arterioles was reduced in aged rats. Cross-sectional area of the vessel wall, measured histologically, was less in aged than adult rats (1,239 +/- 91 vs. 1,832 +/- 180 microns2, p less than 0.05). Point counting stereology was used to quantitate smooth muscle, elastin, collagen, and basement membrane in the arteriolar wall. Cross-sectional areas of smooth muscle and elastin were significantly less in aged than adult rats (744 +/- 57 vs. 1,291 +/- 119 microns2 for smooth muscle, 52 +/- 6 vs. 113 +/- 15 microns2 for elastin; p less than 0.05), whereas cross-sectional areas of collagen and basement membrane were not significantly different in aged and adult rats (4 +/- 1 vs. 3 +/- 1 microns2 for collagen, 236 +/- 17 vs. 258 +/- 31 microns2 for basement membrane). The ratio of nondistensible (collagen and basement membrane) to distensible (smooth muscle and elastin) components was greater in aged than adult rats (0.30 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.01, p less than 0.05). Thus, we conclude that, during aging, cerebral arterioles undergo atrophy, distensibility of cerebral arterioles is reduced, and the relative proportion of distensible elements, elastin and smooth muscle, is reduced in the arteriolar wall.\r"

In vivo, the vasodilator action of acetylcholine may be mediated by EDRF, but prostacyclin or prejunctional inhibition of adrenergic neurotransmission may also be involved. Therefore, we investigated whether acetylcholine releases EDRF in humans in vivo and, if so, whether the response altered in essential hypertension. Acetylcholine was infused into the brachial artery, and forearm blood flow measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. In control subjects, acetylcholine (0.02-16 micrograms/min/100 ml tissue) increased flow from 2.4 +/- 5.0 to 20.6 +/- 5.2 ml/min/100 ml tissue (n = 14; p less than 0.05) and decreased forearm vascular resistance from 42.0 +/- 4.1 to 6.0 +/- 1.4 units (p less than 0.03), a response comparable to that of sodium nitroprusside (0.6 micrograms/min ml tissue). Acetylsalicylic acid (500 mg i.v.) given to block vascular prostacyclin production did not alter the response (n = 14). alpha-Adrenoceptor blockade by phentolamine (12 micrograms/min/100 ml tissue) did not prevent the increase in flow evoked by acetylcholine. In hypertensive patients, the decrease in forearm vascular resistance induced by acetylcholine but not evoked by sodium nitroprusside was reduced as compared with controls (14.5 +/- 3.1 and 6.1 +/- 1.6 units, respectively; n = 8; p less than 0.05). Thus, the vascular effects of acetylcholine in the human forearm circulation are independent of prostaglandins and adrenergic neurotransmission and therefore are most likely to be mediated by EDRF; the acetylcholine-induced release of EDRF is blunted in patients with essential hypertension.\r"

Ventricular septal rupture was diagnosed by turbulent flow traversing the ventricular septum. The direction and velocity of shunt flow was determined by color M-mode and conventional Doppler methods. In all patients, Doppler color flow mapping correctly defined the site of septal rupture, which occurred at areas of discordant septal wall motion or \"hinge points\" (six posterior inlet, three anterior inlet, and six apical trabecular septum). Each of three patients with moderate tricuspid regurgitation and three of four patients with right-to-left shunting during diastole died, and all had an elevated right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Right ventricular wall motion index was significantly higher in the patients who died compared with those who survived (mean +/- SEM; 2.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.2, p = 0.012), but there was no difference in left ventricular wall motion index.

  ".W": "To investigate the potential contribution of cardiopulmonary reflexes in myocardial ischemia, the coronary vascular response to cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading and the number and the duration of spontaneous episodes of symptomatic and asymptomatic myocardial ischemia were evaluated in 23 patients with coronary heart disease. Lower-body negative pressure at -10 mm Hg, which causes selective deactivation of cardiopulmonary receptors, reduced left ventricular filling pressure in all patients, but calculated coronary vascular resistance increased in only 14 patients (from 0.846 +/- 0.1 to 1.07 +/- 0.1 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than 0.01) (group 1). In the remaining nine patients, coronary resistance did not change during cardiopulmonary receptor unloading (group 2). A 60-mm Hg increase in neck tissue pressure, which induces arterial baroreflex-mediated sympathetic activation, caused comparable coronary vasoconstriction in the two groups. Clinical characteristics of the two groups were similar, except that a lower ejection fraction was measured in group 1 (45 +/- 2% vs. 56 +/- 1%, p less than 0.01). In the 14 patients in group 1, 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring showed 151 episodes of myocardial ischemia (average individual value, 10.8 +/- 1), 137 of which were asymptomatic, with an individual daily ischemic period of 62 +/- 6 minutes. In contrast, the nine patients in group 2 had only symptomatic episodes of myocardial ischemia, and the daily ischemic period in these patients was longer than in patients of group 1 (104 +/- 10 minutes, p less than 0.01). After a 3-day treatment with digitalis, the patients of group 2 showed 38 asymptomatic episodes of myocardial ischemia and a shorter daily ischemic period (85 +/- 6 minutes, p less than 0.01 vs. control conditions). In contrast, no change in number and duration of the ischemic episodes was detected in group 1. The effects of acute administration of digitalis (Lanatoside-C 0.02 mg/kg body wt e.v.) on the coronary vascular response to cardiopulmonary receptor unloading were assessed in a separate group of patients with ischemic heart disease. Digitalis treatment did not significantly modify the magnitude of the coronary vascular response induced by -10 mm Hg lower-body negative pressure in the patients showing in control conditions an increase of coronary vascular resistance greater than 20% of the basal value during cardiopulmonary receptor unloading. On the contrary, digitalis potentiated the coronary reflex response to -10 mm Hg lower-body negative pressure in the patients with impaired cardiopulmonary responsiveness (delta percent increase in coronary vascular resistance: 1 +/- 1% in control conditions; 23 +/- 3.9% after digitalis, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We analyzed HR spectral characteristics of 12 healthy young (18-35 years) and 10 healthy old (71-94 years) subjects before and during 60 degrees head-up tilt. Total spectral power in the 0.01-0.40-Hz frequency range and low-frequency (0.06-0.10 Hz) and high-frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) components of the HR power spectrum were significantly lower in old than in young subjects in supine and upright positions. To characterize and compare overall HR variability in young and old subjects, we computed the regression lines relating the log amplitude to the log frequency of the supine HR spectra (l/fx plots). The regression lines for old subjects were lower and steeper (mean slope, -0.78 [5%, 95% confidence limits (CL), -0.73, -0.83]) than in young (mean slope, -0.67 [CL, -0.62, -0.72]), indicating not only reduced overall spectral amplitude but also relatively greater attenuation of high-frequency HR components in the old subjects. This finding illustrates a novel way to quantify the loss of autonomic influences on HR regulation as a function of age. During postural tilt, HR variability was unchanged in the old subjects. For the entire group of young subjects, total HR variability increased during tilt. Six young subjects developed vasovagal syncope during tilt, enabling us to examine differences in the HR spectra of these subjects while they were asymptomatic before syncope.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Incorporation of the right ventricle (RV) into the pulmonary circulation of patients with tricuspid atresia undergoing a Fontan procedure has been advocated. The consequences of this approach on the exercise function of these patients was studied by examining the effects of progressive and steady-state bicycle exercise tests performed by 11 patients with right atrial (RA)-RV Fontan anastomoses, seven patients with RA-pulmonary artery (PA) Fontan anastomoses, 13 patients after repair of tetralogy of Fallot, and 34 normal control patients. All patients were in New York Heart Association class I. The exercise function of the patients undergoing RA-RV and RA-PA Fontan procedures were similar. The achieved peak work loads 60% and 67% of control and peak oxygen consumptions 60% and 64% of control, respectively. Both groups also displayed excessive ventilation, elevated dead space/tidal volume ratios, and depressed cardiac output during steady-state exercise. In contrast, tetralogy of Fallot patients achieved peak work loads and oxygen consumptions 83% of control and maintained normal cardiac outputs and dead space/tidal volume ratios during steady-state exercise. These results suggest that the presence of an RV within the pulmonary circulation of the Fontan patient does not result in improved exercise function. This may be due to the development of obstructive gradients across the RA-RV conduits during exercise or to the RV's negative effect on left ventricular compliance. Moreover, in contrast with the postoperative tetralogy of Fallot patient, the hypoplastic RV of tricuspid atresia may not have sufficient myocardium to assume the active pumping function required by exercise.\r"

  ".U": "90263288\r", 
  ".W": "Because of the relation between left ventricular (LV) chamber elastance and heart size, it has been hypothesized that maximum time-varying elastance (Emax) must be standardized to differentiate between preserved and depressed LV systolic performance. To test this hypothesis, we studied 66 patients, of whom 25 had a normal LV, 20 had aortic regurgitation, 14 had mitral regurgitation, and seven had cardiomyopathy, with micromanometer-determined LV pressures and radionuclide angiograms during multiple LV loading conditions. Multiple regression analysis established that Emax was independently related to LV end-diastolic volume (r = -0.69). When the Emax and LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) data from all patients were plotted, a curvilinear relation was evident. Data transformation to the base e identified two distinct linear relations, one in the normal patients of lnEmax = -0.60 (lnEDV) +4.34 (r = -0.67, p less than 0.001); and one in the patients with cardiac pathology of lnEmax = -1.06 (lnEDV) +6.12 (r = -0.73, p less than 0.001), which differed from each other (p less than 0.01). When a mathematical standardization was applied to these data to eliminate the independent contribution of heart size to the reduction in lnEmax, the normal patients had a standardized lnEmax versus lnEDV slope of 0, whereas that in the patients with cardiac pathology remained negative and continued to differ from that in the normal patients (p less than 0.001). Dichotomization of patients with cardiac pathology into those with preserved and depressed LV chamber elastance by lnEmax or standardized lnEmax provided highly concordant data (k = 0.73, p less than 0.001). Moreover, the estimated contribution of LVEDV to the reduction in Emax in patients with cardiac pathology averaged only 14 +/- 7%. We conclude from these data that LV chamber elastance calculated with radionuclide angiography has an independent relation with LVEDV, that a mathematical standardization of Emax for heart size does not significantly alter the dichotomization of patients with cardiac pathology into those with preserved and depressed LV systolic performance, and that heart size makes a relatively small contribution to the reduction in this index of LV systolic performance. Thus, standardization for heart size may not be necessary to identify whether preserved or depressed LV chamber elastance exists in an individual adult patient with cardiac pathology compared with normal adult patients.\r"

  ".W": "To quantify the three-dimensional regional dynamics of the left ventricular (LV) midwall and the centroid and cross-sectional shape of the LV chamber in the transplanted human heart, 12 miniature radiopaque tantalum markers were implanted in the LV midwall of the donor heart at the time of cardiac transplantation in 15 patients. Stereo cineradiography in the late postoperative period (mean, 52 days after surgery) allowed computer-aided measurements of the three-dimensional coordinates of multiple sites in anterior, inferior, lateral, and septal LV regions at 16.7-msec intervals throughout the cardiac cycle. In awake, supine patients, from maximum to minimum LV volume, group mean translations of free wall markers ranged from 0.80 to 1.24 cm, directed toward the LV interior, whereas translations of septal wall markers were significantly less, 0.46 and 0.34 cm (p less than 0.01), directed away from the LV interior. A component of this translation along the septal-lateral axis was also significantly less (p less than 0.01) in the septum (0.19 and 0.20 cm) than in the free wall, where it ranged from 0.32 to 0.97 cm. The LV cross section was not circular, and anterior-inferior dimensions (7.18 +/- 0.66 and 6.13 +/- 0.79 cm, at maximum and minimum volumes, respectively) were significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than septal-lateral dimensions (5.78 +/- 0.65 and 5.12 +/- 0.48 cm), yielding an unchanging transverse elliptical LV eccentricity (0.58 +/- 0.13). The position of the LV center of volume did not change significantly from maximum to minimum volume in the direction of either the LV long axis or the anterior-inferior axis, but it did change significantly (0.55 +/- 0.23 cm, p less than 0.01) along the septal-lateral axis. We conclude 1) as viewed in a fixed external reference system, midwall sites in the interventricular septum of the transplanted human heart move paradoxically yet are relatively immobile compared with the three-dimensional dynamics of midwall sites in the LV free wall; 2) the transverse cross-sectional shape of the LV in the transplanted human heart is decidedly oval, with significantly greater anterior-posterior than septal-lateral dimensions at the time of maximum and minimum LV volumes; and 3) the center of volume in the transplanted human LV is remarkably stable in the directions of the LV long axis and anterior-posterior axis, suggesting a balance of forces along these axes, yet it moves significantly toward the interventricular septum, presumably counterbalancing the opposite translation during systole of the right ventricular (RV) center of volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous coronary excimer laser angioplasty in 60 patients with coronary artery disease. Forty-nine patients had stable exertional angina, and 11 patients had unstable angina despite medical therapy. A novel 1.4-mm diameter catheter with 20 quartz fibers of 100-microns diameter each arranged concentrically around a central lumen suitable for a 0.014-in. flexible guide wire was coupled to an excimer laser. A commercial excimer laser emitting energy at a wavelength of 308 nm with a pulse duration of 60 nsec was used. The laser was operated at 20 Hz. Mean energy transmission was 30 +/- 5 mJ/mm2. In five of the 60 patients, laser angioplasty was not attempted. In 23 patients with laser ablation alone, percent stenosis decreased from 76 +/- 14% before to 27 +/- 17% after ablation and was 34 +/- 15% at the early follow-up angiogram. In 32 patients, additional balloon angioplasty was performed because of vessel closure after laser ablation in 11 and an insufficient qualitative result in 21 patients. Of the 11 patients with unstable angina, one patient died due to vessel closure 3 hours after intervention, and two patients developed a myocardial infarction. In 22 of 47 patients with late follow-up angiography, restenosis within the 6-month follow-up period occurred. Rate of restenosis was higher in patients treated with laser ablation and balloon angioplasty (16 of 28) than in patients treated with laser ablation alone (six of 19). These results suggest that coronary excimer laser angioplasty for ablation of obstructive lesions is feasible and safe in patients with stable angina. However, development of new catheter systems is necessary for an improved success rate.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effects of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) administered by intracoronary and intravenous routes in 10 patients with severe coronary artery disease, stable effort angina, and very low exercise tolerance. Supine bicycle ergometer exercise was performed under four conditions: 1) control, 2) after intracoronary administration of 0.4 mg ISDN, 3) 1 hour later (control 2), and 4) after administration of intravenous 4 mg ISDN. At rest, intracoronary ISDN caused no significant hemodynamic effects, whereas intravenous infusion of ISDN resulted in a decline in left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure (-20 +/- 5 mm Hg), LV end-diastolic volume (-27 +/- 3%), and LV end-systolic volume (-30 +/- 4%). After intracoronary infusion of ISDN, ST segment depression and the increase in LV end-diastolic pressure and LV end-systolic volume induced by exercise were significantly less abnormal than during control (0.20 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.14 +/- 0.08 mV, 36 +/- 7 vs. 24 +/- 8 mm Hg, and 91 +/- 40% vs. 40 +/- 29%, respectively). When exercise was performed after intravenous infusion of ISDN, the above-mentioned parameters were significantly improved even further: ST segment depression to 0.05 +/- 0.07 mV, end-diastolic pressure to 14 +/- 7 mm Hg, and LV end-systolic volume to 5 +/- 11% (all p less than 0.01 compared with intracoronary ISDN). Thus, in patients with severe coronary artery disease, it is suggested that intracoronary nitrates increase coronary blood supply during effort-induced ischemia, based on significant improvements in the indirect measures of ST segment depression, LV end-diastolic pressure, and LV volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism of antianginal action of the calcium channel blocker nisoldipine and to determine the reproducibility of the clinical and hemodynamic events induced by supine leg exercise, 30 patients with stable effort angina pectoris were studied. They were divided into two groups; one group of 19 patients received a single 10-mg dose of nisoldipine orally, and the other group of 11 patients received a single dose of placebo orally. Chest pain was induced in all of 30 patients during the control exercise test. After nisoldipine administration, chest pain was not induced in 13 of 19 patients and was of lessened severity in five patients with the same work load as those performing control exercise. ST segment at peak exercise showed less severe depression after nisoldipine. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced by 38% (p less than 0.001) at rest and 22% (p less than 0.001) at peak exercise, and coronary vascular resistance was reduced by 31% (p less than 0.01) at rest and 18% (p less than 0.01) at peak exercise. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure fell from 6 +/- 1 to 3 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) at rest and from 28 +/- 3 to 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) at peak exercise. Coronary sinus flow at rest and myocardial oxygen uptake both at rest and during exercise was not modified by nisoldipine. However, coronary sinus flow at peak exercise increased significantly from 219 +/- 24 to 249 +/- 31 ml/min (p less than 0.01) after nisoldipine, and myocardial oxygen uptake was not significantly changed despite decreased coronary vascular resistance. The clinical and hemodynamic events induced by the exercise during invasive studies (except pulmonary artery wedge pressure at rest) were reproducible after placebo administration. Our data demonstrate that increased coronary blood flow could be the major mechanism of the antianginal action of nisoldipine in supine leg exercise-induced angina.\r"

We recorded monophasic action potentials (MAPs) during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion to investigate whether afterdepolarizations develop in vivo when reperfusion arrhythmias occur. In 15 anesthetized cats, 24 trials of 10 minutes of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery were followed by reperfusion. In 13 of 24 (54%) trials, afterdepolarizations developed at the moment of reperfusion, with a mean amplitude of 2.4 +/- 1.1 mV (13 +/- 8% of MAP amplitude). When cycle length was either increased by vagal stimulation or decreased by atrial pacing, early afterdepolarization (EAD) amplitude was modified, according to what has been described for EAD in vitro, with a positive linear correlation between cycle length and EAD amplitude (r = 0.91, p less than 0.0001). The occurrence of EAD was not related to rapid changes in left ventricular pressure. In the eight of 13 (62%) cases in which EAD development was associated with reperfusion arrhythmias, the coupling interval of the EAD and of premature ventricular contractions showed a significant correlation (r = 0.86, p less than 0.0001). However, in five of 13 (38%) cases, occurrence of reperfusion arrhythmias was not accompanied by the presence of EAD on the MAP recording. In two animals, a 2:1 block of EAD conduction was observed, and this was reflected on the intracavitary electrocardiogram as T wave alternans. Thus, EADs occur frequently after reperfusion in vivo, with a time course that parallels the onset of reperfusion arrhythmias. This finding further supports the role of triggered activity in the genesis of reperfusion arrhythmias in vivo.\r"

Canine left anterior descending coronary arteries were exposed to ischemia (60 minutes) followed by reperfusion (12 weeks). Rings (3-4 mm wide) of the reperfused artery and of normal left circumflex (control) coronary artery segments were suspended in organ chambers containing physiological saline solution (37 degrees C, gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2) for isometric force measurement. Endothelium-independent contractions to KCl or prostaglandin F2 alpha and endothelium-independent relaxations to nitric oxide or isoproterenol were comparable in control and chronically reperfused arteries. However, chronically reperfused coronary arteries exhibited impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations to aggregating platelets. In addition, the reperfused coronary arteries exhibited impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations to the platelet-derived compounds adenosine diphosphate, serotonin, and thrombin. However, the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were comparable between control and reperfused arteries. Thus, after 12 weeks of reperfusion, previously occluded coronary arteries exhibited a selective impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation evoked by aggregating platelets. In vivo, this phenomenon could favor platelet adhesion, aggregation, and platelet-induced contraction of coronary smooth muscle and thus facilitate ischemic events such as vasospasm and coronary thrombosis.\r"

This study was performed to assess the effects of coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion on the distribution of myocardial blood flow produced by endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilators. The endothelium was damaged by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 45 minutes followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Intracoronary infusions of the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine, bradykinin and thiazolylethylamine or the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside were performed, and regional myocardial blood flow (by radioactive microspheres) was measured before and after occlusion and reperfusion. There were no changes in systemic hemodynamics during intracoronary infusion of vasodilators before or after coronary occlusion and reperfusion. All vasodilators produced similar increases in transmural blood flow before occlusion; however, only the endothelium-dependent vasodilators produced a significant increase in the subendocardial-to-subepicardial blood flow ratio. Increases in transmural flow as well as the preferential increase in subendocardial blood flow produced by acetylcholine, bradykinin, and thiazolylethylamine were attenuated after coronary occlusion and reperfusion. In contrast, increases in transmural blood flow produced by sodium nitroprusside were unchanged. These results suggest that the preferential increase in subendocardial perfusion produced by acetylcholine, bradykinin, and thiazolylethylamine is endothelium-dependent and may be selectively modified by ischemic insult.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the relation between regional myocardial blood flow, contractile function, and myocardial lactate release during mild-to-moderate regional myocardial ischemia, nine open-chest swine were instrumented for measurement of regional myocardial blood flow (microsphere method), contractile function (sonomicrometry), and hemodynamics. L-[1-14C]Lactate or L-[U-13C]lactate was infused intravenously using a primed continuous infusion technique to quantify regional myocardial lactate release. D-[U-13C]glucose or D-[6-14C]glucose was simultaneously infused to determine the contribution of exogenous glucose to lactate release. Graded coronary ischemia (two to three levels) was created in the left anterior descending coronary arterial distribution by mechanically constricting the artery in five animals or by decreasing flow through a cannulated left anterior descending artery in four animals. In all nine animals, subendocardial blood flow was 0.99 +/- 0.21 (ml/min)/g during control and 0.34 +/- 0.14 (ml/min)/g during the most severe grade of underperfusion (p less than 0.001) in the left anterior descending coronary arterial distribution. Regional myocardial lactate release was 0.15 +/- 0.09 and 1.19 +/- 0.75 mumols/ml, respectively (p less than 0.003). A highly significant inverse correlation was observed between subendocardial blood flow and myocardial lactate release during the graded reductions in blood flow (r = -0.71, p less than 0.001). Results from sonomicrometry showed a significant reduction in contractile ventricular function in the anterior wall during the graded reductions in blood flow. The regional arterial-venous glucose difference increased significantly with underperfusion in the left anterior descending coronary arterial distribution, from 0.14 +/- 0.15 to 0.56 +/- 0.37 mumols/ml (p less than 0.003). The contribution of exogenous glucose to lactate release also increased significantly; 0.04 +/- 0.03 mumols/ml of the lactate came from exogenous glucose during control compared with 0.64 +/- 0.59 mumols/ml during the most severe underperfusion (p less than 0.02). A significant positive correlation exists between lactate release and lactate from exogenous glucose during graded underperfusion (r = 0.96, p less than 0.001). In summary, these data demonstrate a close inverse relation between regional myocardial lactate release and regional subendocardial blood flow during graded ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Single-unit carotid sinus baroreceptor activity was recorded in normal and heart-failure (pacing-induced) dogs. The sensitivity of these units was compared between the two groups of dogs. After development of clinical heart failure, the animals were anesthetized, and the left carotid sinus was vascularly isolated and perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution. Single-unit baroreceptor discharge was recorded from the carotid sinus nerve in response to stepwise increases in carotid sinus pressure (CSP). In addition, the carotid sinus diameter was measured with sonomicrometer crystals. In this way, both CSP-discharge and CSP-diameter curves were constructed for both normal and heart-failure dogs. Analysis of these curves demonstrated that the heart-failure group exhibited a significant decrease in peak discharge (48.1 +/- 3.0 vs. 22.2 +/- 2.2 spikes/sec; p less than 0.001) and a significant elevation in threshold pressure compared with the normal animals (91.0 +/- 5.0 vs. 119.1 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). The peak slope of the CSP-discharge curve was also significantly lower in the heart-failure group (0.63 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.40 +/- 0.09 spikes/sec/mm Hg; p less than 0.05). In the heart-failure group, perfusion of the carotid sinus with ouabain (0.01 micrograms/ml) caused a significant decrease in threshold pressure and a significant increase in peak discharge frequency, as well as an increase in slope of the CSP-discharge curve. There were no changes in CSP-diameter relations in response to ouabain. This dose of ouabain had no effect on pressure-discharge relations or carotid sinus diameters in normal dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to determine if a coronary artery stenosis would result in more-severe perfusion abnormalities in hypertrophied compared with normal canine hearts during exercise. Studies were performed in eight normal control dogs and in seven adult dogs in which a 67% increase in left ventricular mass wa produced by banding the ascending aorta at 9 weeks of age. Myocardial blood flow was measured by the microsphere method during treadmill exercise in the presence of a coronary artery stenosis that decreased distal coronary perfusion pressure to 55 or 42 mm Hg. At a coronary pressure of 55 mm Hg, mean myocardial blood flow was decreased by 23 +/- 5% in normal control dogs but was decreased by 53 +/- 10% in dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (p less than 0.05, comparing normal vs. LVH dogs). Similarly, at a coronary pressure of 42 mm Hg, mean blood flow was decreased by 53 +/- 6% below control in normal dogs but was decreased by 76 +/- 5% below control values in dogs with LVH (p less than 0.01, comparing normal vs. LVH dogs). In both groups of dogs, the stenosis caused a gradient of hypoperfusion, worsening from epicardium to endocardium. However, for each level of stenosis, subendocardial blood flow and the ratio of subendocardial to subepicardial blood flow was less in LVH than in normal canine hearts. These findings demonstrate that the presence of LVH secondary to long-term pressure overload is associated with an increased vulnerability to myocardial hypoperfusion during exercise in the presence of a coronary artery stenosis.\r"

With verapamil, d-propranolol oral clearance decreased 32% (p less than 0.05), and 1-propranolol oral clearance decreased 26% (p less than 0.05). The unbound fraction of d-propranolol was higher than that of 1-propranolol (p less than 0.05), but the protein binding was not altered by diltiazem or verapamil. Both drugs therefore decreased the unbound oral clearance of each propranolol enantiomer (p less than 0.05). Verapamil caused a stereoselective effect and increased the d/l ratio of propranolol serum concentrations (p less than 0.05) and decreased the d/l ratio of oral clearance (p less than 0.05).\r"

Plasma epinephrine increased with all three treatments and more with beta 1-blockade than with placebo. Plasma norepinephrine decreased with administration of beta 2-blockade. Thus neither beta 1- nor beta 2-blockade prevents an increase in blood pressure during acute flight phobia stress. Increased plasma epinephrine seems to be the sympathetic variable that is closest related to this increase in blood pressure. Norepinephrine may be less consistently related to the blood pressure rise during flight phobia stress as shown by the decrease in plasma norepinephrine with administration of beta 2-blockade.\r"

Both values decreased in patients with renal failure and correlated significantly with measured creatinine clearances (r2 = 0.938 and 0.884, respectively). A nomogram for dosage adjustment in patients with varying degrees of renal failure is presented.\r"

Five simple clinical indices of organ system failure were selected and weighted according to their statistically validated relationship to mortality, resulting in a daily System Outcome Score (SOS). Cluster analysis was used to divide the creation data set of 2,777 patients into suitable groupings of scores to predict mortality; the clustering was confirmed for reproducibility with a validation set of an additional 2,860 patients. Based on this validation of the scoring system, two computer-controlled patient care surveillance techniques were developed. The first involved the definition of three unfavorable SOS patterns evolving during the course of a patient's admission. Detection of one or more of these patterns, described by the acronym SDL, permits review of the care administered to the specific patient generating the pattern. A global assessment of care is achieved with the Outcome Index (OI), which relates overall mortality risk in the ICU to the actual mortality rate over a given time period. Effectiveness of care can then be compared between different time periods within the one unit or between different units with similar patient mix. The overall system offers the potential for a surveillance-based quality assurance system with widespread applicability.\r"

To determine whether the response to phenylephrine is potentiated by Ca administration, we studied eight adult patients 24 h after aortocoronary bypass surgery. Each patient received three doses of phenylephrine (150, 300, and 450 ng/kg.min), administered both with and without CaCl2 (5 mg/kg bolus followed by a 2-mg/kg.h infusion). Phenylephrine alone at 150, 300, and 450 ng/kg.min increased MAP by 2%, 6%, and 17%, respectively. Ca alone increased serum ionized Ca levels from 1.00 +/- .03 (SEM) to 1.20 +/- .02 mM (p less than .05) and increased MAP from 84 +/- 1 to 90 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than .05), but had no effect on cardiac index (CI). When administered concurrently with Ca, phenylephrine at 150, 300, and 450 ng/kg.min increased MAP by 6%, 7%, and 13%, respectively. Phenylephrine had no effect on CI, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, CVP, or heart rate whether or not it was administered with Ca. We conclude that concomitant Ca administration does not augment the hypertensive response to phenylephrine in normotensive patients recovering from open heart surgery.\r"

Patient populations were similar in terms of severity of illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores), age, ventilation, invasive procedures, and the incidence of various diseases. We found that the rate of amikacin resistance increased from 8.5% to 39.6% with an increase in resistance to tobramycin (19.3% to 33.3%) and netilmicin (23.9% to 47.9%) over the same period despite minimal usage of these drugs. The clinical outcome was similar in the periods contrasted. Our findings suggest that restricting aminoglycosides to amikacin only resulted in increasing Gram-negative resistance although there was no significant effect on patient outcome.\r"

Microvascular permeability was assessed using the capillary filtration coefficient (Kfc) before and 5, 30, and 60 min after a 15-min period of ventilation. Baseline Kfc was not significantly different between groups. A significant increase over the baseline Kfc was noted at 60 min in group 2 and in all postventilation Kfc values in groups 3 and 4 (p less than .05). Group 1 Kfc values did not change significantly after ventilation. At all post-ventilation times, values for Kfc were significantly greater in groups 3 and 4 than in group 1 (p less than .05). Group 4 Kfc values were significantly greater than those in group 2 at 5 and 30 min postventilation. These data indicate that high PIP, and to a lesser extent, high gas flow rates cause microvascular injury in the compliant nonadult lung and suggest that the combination of high PIP and high gas flow rates are the most threatening to microvascular integrity.\r"

When we averaged data for 100 studies, 5-min interval observations for each variable did not deviate from baseline over a 2-h period (p greater than .70). With a sample size of 100 studies, we could detect a change in cardiac output of +/- 5% at the p less than .005 level with a power of 0.95. We conclude that with a sufficiently large sample size, studies employing the NCCOM3 can detect clinically significant cardiovascular changes due to pharmacologic or procedural stressors.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the accuracy of a pneumotachometer (PN) for tidal volume (VT) measurements during high-frequency oscillation (HFO), we determined simultaneously VT using a PN and a full body plethysmograph (PL) in 12 rabbits. HFO was delivered with an oscillator at a frequency of 10 Hz, mean airway pressure of 8 cm H2O, and inspiratory time of 50%. Pressure amplitude (delta P) was varied as follows: 40, 60, 80, 20, 100, 40 cm H2O. Finally, in ten rabbits a spacer equal in deadspace (VD) to that of the PN (15 ml) was left in-line for 5 min. Blood gases were obtained before and after the spacer was added. We found that VT-PN correlates well with VT-PL (r = .92), although the difference between VT-PN and VT-PL is greater at large VT. Significant respiratory acidosis developed with the spacer in-line. PN may be used to trend VT during HFO but PN must not be left in-line, as increased VD seriously affects ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "Traditional formulas, such as the Harris and Benedict equation (HBE), do not accurately predict energy expenditure (EE) in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients (MVCIP). The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive EE equation to assess EE requirements in MVCIP. A portable metabolic cart was used to measure indirectly EE in 112 MVCIP. Patients were studied at rest and for 30 min on the first or second day of ICU admission. No nutrition was received during the study period. Variables investigated were: age, BSA, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, sepsis score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), respiratory rate (f), tidal volume (VT), minute ventilation, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, body temperature (Temp), and outcome. Patient age, APACHE II score, sepsis score, ISS, and BSA were 50 +/- 20 yr, 16 +/- 7, 11 +/- 6, 32 +/- 14, and 1.80 +/- 0.27 m2, respectively. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were used with EE as the dependent variable. A predictive equation (EE [kcal/day] = 945 BSA -6.4 age + 108 Temp + 24.2 f + 817 VT -4349) was determined from variables that contributed greater than 3% to the variance of EE: BSA (52%), age (10%), f (5%), VT (5%), and Temp (3%). The HBE underestimated measured EE by 34 +/- 19% and in 79 patients deviated greater than 15%. Using the new equation, only 15 patients' EE deviated greater than 15% from measured EE. The new predictive EE equation can accurately assess EE in MVCIP.\r"

This finding suggests a continued need for investigation into the stresses associated with the delivery of critical care.\r"

Total body clearance for amikacin was 10.54 ml/min and CVVH clearance was 10.11 ml/min. Sieving coefficient for amikacin was 0.93 +/- 0.16. Our data show that during CVVH at a filtration rate of 10 ml/min, the clearance of amikacin is similar to that reported in patients with renal failure who are not being treated with CVVH.\r"
