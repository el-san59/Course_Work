  ".W": "While the role of nitrates in the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemia is well established, the use of theophylline, proposed almost a century ago, is still controversial. Also controversial is its mechanism of action, initially thought to be coronary dilation. In this randomized, single-blind study, the acute effects on exercise capacity of sublingual isosorbide dinitrate (10 mg) and of intravenous theophylline ethylenediamine (7 mg/kg) were assessed in 10 patients with chronic stable angina and positive exercise test. After the administration of theophylline, the time to onset of angina, the heart rate-blood pressure product at 1-mm ST-segment depression and the exercise duration were similar to that after isosorbide dinitrate administration (9.8 +/- 2.3 vs 9.3 +/- 1.7 minutes, 207 +/- 41 vs 207 +/- 48 beats/min.mm Hg.10(-2) and 10.8 +/- 2 vs 10.4 +/- 2 minutes, respectively). Both drugs significantly (p less than 0.001) improved all these parameters compared to the baseline exercise test. The effect of the 2 drugs on the diameters of angiographically normal segments of large epicardial coronary arteries was then assessed using computerized quantitative angiography in 10 other patients with stable angina. Whereas theophylline failed to increase the coronary diameters compared to that in the baseline angiogram (2.9 +/- 0.6 vs 2.9 +/- 0.6 mm, respectively), the subsequent administration of isosorbide dinitrate resulted in an increase up to 3.2 +/- 0.7 mm (p less than 0.02). Thus, in patients with stable angina, theophylline delays the onset of angina, increases the ischemic threshold and prolongs the exercise duration to the same degree as isosorbide dinitrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The development of myocardial ischemia was studied using subjective (pain) and objective (electrocardiography) parameters. Pretreatment with intravenous diltiazem resulted in a significantly delayed onset of ischemic pain and ST-segment elevation; these variables also returned to baseline earlier after balloon deflation. Thus, intravenous diltiazem prevents or delays the onset of myocardial ischemia during repetitive transient coronary occlusions; improvement of the myocardial blood flow distal to the coronary occlusion or impedance of calcium entry into the ischemic cell are considered as possible mechanisms. Because PTCA is increasingly used in patients with poor left ventricular function and more extensive disease, and because recent evidence suggests that better PTCA results could be obtained by the use of longer inflation times, the addition of diltiazem to the classic armamentarium could be beneficial.\r"

One month after PTCA, 59% of patients had resumed work whereas 87% were employed 6 months after PTCA. Patients who had a myocardial infarction in the month before PTCA, as well as those with less than 12 years of education, blue collar jobs and low levels of self-efficacy (self-confidence) for return to work had a lower probability of work resumption at every point in the 24 weeks of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed the psychosocial construct, self-efficacy, to be the strongest predictor of return to work 1 month after PTCA, independent of having a recent myocardial infarction, disease severity, age, job classification, gender and physician advice (p = 0.0006). Kaplan-Meier analysis for return to work after PTCA confirmed that patients with high self-efficacy estimates obtained just before hospital discharge after PTCA resumed employment earlier than those with low self-efficacy levels (p = 0.0001). The same relation was observed in those patients with and without a myocardial infarction in the month before PTCA, p = 0.0022 and 0.0012 respectively. These findings suggest that although PTCA is considered relatively safe and minimally invasive by physicians, patients may still lack confidence in their ability to return to work even when physically capable of doing so.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the role of intravenous isoproterenol for the facilitation of electrophysiologic induction of atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia, 20 patients with dual AV node pathways who lacked inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia at control study had a constant isoproterenol infusion administered and underwent repeat study. Six (30%) of 20 patients (group I) had inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia during isoproterenol infusion whereas the other 14 (70%) patients (group II) did not. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia was clinically documented in all 6 group I patients compared to 3 (21%) of 14 group II patients (p = 0.002). The sensitivity and specificity of isoproterenol-facilitated induction of AV node reentrant tachycardia were 67 and 100%, respectively. The isoproterenol-facilitated induction of sustained AV node reentry was mediated by resolution of the weak link in anterograde slow pathway in 2 (33%) patients, in retrograde fast pathway in 3 (50%) and in both anterograde slow and retrograde fast pathways in 1 (17%) patient. Four group I patients were given intravenous propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg body weight, and had complete suppression of isoproterenol-facilitated induction of AV node reentry. Thus, intravenous isoproterenol is a rather sensitive and highly specific adjunct to electrophysiologic induction of AV node reentrant tachycardia in patients with dual AV node pathways but without inducible sustained AV node reentry.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacokinetic-dynamic relations for amiodarone have been difficult to define. Few studies have successfully correlated serum amiodarone concentration with either dose or pharmacodynamic effects. Reduction in heart rate, prolongation of corrected QT interval and accumulation of corneal microdeposits are 3 clinical effects well suited for making kinetic-dynamic comparisons because they occur in virtually all patients receiving amiodarone. Data on heart rate, corrected QT interval, corneal microdeposits, cumulative dose and serum concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone (DEA) were collected over the course of 1 year after initiation of therapy in 27 patients (mean age 55.4 +/- 2.35 years). Mean elimination half-lives in this study population were 56 days for amiodarone and 129 days for DEA, as estimated from cumulation kinetics without drug withdrawal. The extremely long half-lives of amiodarone and DEA make demonstration of steady-state concentration-response relations difficult. A new approach using analysis of sequential data before steady-state reveals general relations between dose, DEA concentration and 3 clinically observable effects of amiodarone. A linear relation was evident between DEA concentration and log mean cumulative amiodarone dose (mg/kg) for the population. The steep segments of the concentration-response curves for heart rate, microdeposits and corrected QT interval occurred at low, medium and high serum amiodarone and DEA concentrations, respectively. Patients not developing a decrease in heart rate or corneal microdeposits likely have very low serum drug concentrations and may not be adequately treated. The monitoring of heart rate, corrected QT interval and corneal microdeposits as an aid to assessing adequacy of amiodarone therapy requires further study.\r"

Insertion of the energy source may be delayed due to its unavailability or to a desire for postoperative electrophysiologic study before its insertion. To assess the effects of permanent internal defibrillator patches on external defibrillation, 7 anesthetized calves were studied. Fibrillation-defibrillation studies were performed before and after insertion of permanent internal defibrillator patches (model L67, 27 cm2, Intec Systems), one on each ventricle. The values of percent successful defibrillation obtained before insertion of the patches, although much lower than values that would be expected in humans, are consistent with the results of an extensive earlier study involving this calf model. Similar values obtained after insertion of the patches are appreciably lower than the values obtained before implantation of the patches, and appreciably lower than the results predicted by the earlier study. A significant decrease in the percent of successful defibrillations (p less than 0.001) was observed for a shock intensity of approximately 400 J. Permanent internal cardiac defibrillator patches on the right and left ventricles reduce the probability of achieving successful defibrillation externally with unidirectional shocks. The wisdom of implanting permanent large internal cardiac defibrillator patches without the energy source is questioned.\r"

The clinical indication for the electrophysiologic study was either documented monomorphic VT or unexplained syncope. The pacing protocol included 2 right ventricular pacing sites, 2 basic drive cycle lengths and up to 3 extrastimuli. In 111 studies, nonsustained polymorphic VT was induced and with continuation of the programmed stimulation protocol, sustained monomorphic VT was induced in 48 studies (43%) and polymorphic VT was induced in 13 studies (12%). Overall, sustained monomorphic VT was induced in 110 studies and sustained polymorphic VT in 18 studies. The incidence of nonsustained polymorphic VT preceding the induction of sustained polymorphic VT was significantly greater than the incidence of nonsustained polymorphic VT preceding the induction of sustained monomorphic VT (72 vs 44%, p less than 0.05). Nonsustained polymorphic VT is not a useful predictor of the outcome of programmed ventricular stimulation. The use of nonsustained polymorphic VT as an endpoint for stimulation would be likely to improve the specificity of programmed ventricular stimulation by limiting the induction of sustained nonclinical arrhythmias that require countershock, but at the cost of significantly impairing the yield of monomorphic VT.\r"

Blood samples for electrolytes and catecholamines were obtained at rest, at peak exercise and 10 minutes after exercise. There were no substantial differences comparing the first to the second placebo phase or the first to the second treatment period. As expected, hydrochlorothiazide treatment caused a significant decrease in serum potassium (4.00 +/- 0.44 to 3.32 +/- 0.49 mEq/liter, p less than 0.001). Serum magnesium did not change with treatment. Serum potassium, serum magnesium and plasma catecholamines increased significantly with exercise. No rebound hypokalemia occurred during recovery. Occasional ventricular premature contractions were noted at rest during all phases of the study, with only a slight increase in frequency during exercise. Couplets were noted only rarely. No difference in the frequency or complexity of arrhythmias was noted between placebo and treatment periods.

The decreased total wall thickness and increased radius to thickness ratio suggest a trend toward regression of LV hypertrophy. These findings, along with improvements in blood pressure, pulse and exercise stress tests, indicate potential benefits of atenolol in managing patients with essential hypertension and LV hypertrophy.\r"

Although also dependent on the sympathetic activity of the heart, HR variability is mainly determined by the vagal outflow of the heart. Several HR abnormalities have been described in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF); however, there are no data on HR variability in CHF patients. In the present study HR variability was assessed in 20 CHF patients and 20 control subjects from 24-hour Holter tapes. HR variability was evaluated by calculating the mean hourly HR standard deviation and by analyzing the 24-hour RR histogram. Mean hourly HR standard deviation was markedly and significantly reduced in CHF patients both over the 24-hour period (97.5 +/- 41 vs 233.2 +/- 26 ms, p less than 0.001) as well as during most of the individual hours examined. The 24-hour RR histogram of CHF patients had a different shape and had a decreased variation compared to control subjects (total variability 356 +/- 102 vs 757 +/- 156 ms, p less than 0.001). Thus, CHF patients with depressed ejection fraction (less than 30%) have a low HR variability compared to normal individuals. This result can be interpreted as adjunctive evidence for decreased parasympathetic activity to the heart during CHF.\r"

MR jet size was quantitatively compared in 29 hemodynamically and temporally matched open-chest epicardial and transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography studies from 22 patients (18 with native and 4 with porcine mitral valves) scheduled to undergo mitral valve repair or replacement. Jet area, jet length and left atrial area were analyzed. Comparison of jet area measurements as assessed by epicardial and transesophageal color flow mapping revealed an excellent correlation between the techniques (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001). Epicardial and transesophageal jet length measurements were also similar (r = 0.77, p less than 0.001). Left atrial area could not be measured in 18 transesophageal studies (62%) due to foreshortening, and in 5 epicardial studies (17%) due to poor image resolution. Acoustic interference with left atrial and color flow mapping signals was noted in all patients with mitral valve prostheses when imaged by epicardial echocardiography, but this did not occur with transesophageal imaging. Thus, in patients undergoing valve repair or replacement, transesophageal and epicardial color flow mapping provide similar quantitative assessment of MR jet size. Jet area to left atrial area ratios have limited applicability in transesophageal color flow mapping, due to foreshortening of the left atrial borders in transesophageal views. Transesophageal color flow mapping may be especially useful in assessing dysfunctional mitral prostheses due to the lack of left atrial acoustic interference.\r"

The reliability of these indexes as markers for intrinsic myocardial diastolic properties has been questioned. Micro-manometer left atrial (LA) and LV pressures as well as transmitral Doppler flow velocity signals and M-mode and 2-dimensional echocardiograms were simultaneously recorded. These unique measurements were acquired in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy under baseline conditions and during infusion of high dose amrinone. The response to amrinone was chosen as a hemodynamic model because this drug has previously been described as having beneficial effects on overall LV systolic and diastolic performance. At peak amrinone effect, LV contractility increased (as assessed using load independent end-systolic indexes) and early diastolic relaxation improved whereas passive chamber stiffness, heart rate and stroke volume were unchanged. There was a significant decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure as well as a parallel downward shift of the entire LV diastolic pressure-dimension relation. These findings, which indicated an improvement in overall LV diastolic properties, probably represent the combination of more rapid early diastolic relaxation in conjunction with a reduction in venous return, the relief of pericardial restraint or the reduction in right ventricular-LV interaction. In contrast, the ratios of Doppler-determined peak transmitral early-to-late flow velocities and early-to-late diastolic flow velocity integrals decreased with amrinone infusion, thereby suggesting a drug-induced decrease in LV diastolic compliance. Thus, in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, administration of amrinone has a complex effect on LV diastolic properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Accordingly, 12 patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease performed identical symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise tests with and without noseclip and mouthpiece. Right-sided cardiac hemodynamic measurements, radionuclide ventriculography and arterial and mixed venous gas sampling were performed during each exercise test. Exhaled gases were analyzed during the noseclip/mouthpiece exercise. The order of exercise tests was alternated. Comparing exercises with and without a noseclip, there were significant reductions in exercise duration (397 +/- 270 vs 300 +/- 230 seconds, p less than 0.01), exercise oxygen consumption (780 +/- 279 vs 638 +/- 200 ml/min, p less than 0.01) and exercise cardiac output (8.4 +/- 2.7 vs 7.3 +/- 2.0 liters/min, p less than 0.05), an increase in right ventricular ejection fraction (0.39 +/- 0.08 vs 0.43 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.01) and no change in exercise heart rate (106 +/- 14 vs 106 +/- 14), right-sided cardiac pressures or arterial and mixed venous blood gases. These data suggest that a noseclip/mouthpiece can limit exercise tolerance in advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. This limitation may result from decreased right-sided cardiac preload (venous return).\r"

A duodenal perfusion technique was used to quantify the concentrations and output of pancreatic enzymes after ingestion of a standard test meal. Samples were aspirated from the ligament of Trietz and analyzed for pH, total protein, amylase, trypsin, and lipase activity. No significant changes were observed in duodenal flow rate pH, total protein, amylase, or trypsin concentrations and outputs after fiber supplementation. A marked increase in mean (+/- SEM) lipase concentration (U/mL) and output (kU/min) in both the resting and postprandial states was seen, reaching statistical significance (p less than 0.05) at 120 min postprandial. These data suggest that in man, a 4-wk dietary fiber supplementation program can modulate pancreatic lipase secretion.\r"

Various analytical procedures were used to measure AA concentrations in blood components. The depletion period resulted in a marked decrease in AA in all blood indices. During the study scorbutic signs developed in some of the subjects. AA supplements of 30 mg/d for 10 d failed to increase plasma ascorbate concentrations; 60 mg/d for 10 d produced a small increase; 90 mg/d resulted in a mean AA concentration of 29 mumol/L. EA did not present any adverse effects, but rather had a small sparing effect. Vitamin C requirements for adult nonsmoking, nonpregnant women would be marginally met by an intake of 60 mg/d of AA whereas 90 mg/d would provide an allowance for body storage.\r"

A comparison of linear regression models that either included or excluded dietary glycosylated vitamin B-6 content indicates that the intake of glycosylated vitamin B-6 had little, if any, effect upon maternal plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate concentration and maternal urinary excretion of total vitamin B-6 and 4-pyridoxic acid. On the basis of guidelines from the literature for evaluating biochemical indices of vitamin B-6 nutriture, the women appeared to be consuming adequate amounts of the vitamin. The mean breast-milk concentrations of total and glycosylated vitamin B-6 were 733 and 18 nmol/L, respectively.

Vitamin B-6 compounds were measured by a Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay in blood taken 1-60 min after injection. After either injection there was a considerable amount of PN in the red cells at 1 min but by 3 min a large amount of that PN had disappeared, mostly unaccounted for by conversion to PL forms. Although there was considerably less PN at 1 min in both red cells and plasma after the smaller injection, in the next 2 min similar amounts had left the red cells (4.59 and 4.30 mumol) and plasma (9.37 and 10.09 mumol), respectively, after the injections.

Hypoalbuminemia was more common in breast-fed than in formula-fed infants. Seventy-two-hour fecal fat excretion correlated inversely with serum alpha-tocopherol. Treatment with oral pancreatic enzyme supplements, a multiple vitamin, and additional vitamin E was associated with normalization of serum albumin, retinol, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D and negative PIVKA at age 6 and 12 mo. Approximately 10% of patients remained vitamin E deficient. Biochemical evidence of fat-soluble-vitamin deficiencies is common before age 3 mo in patients with CF and, except for vitamin E, these deficiencies corrected with standard therapy.\r"

This wide range may partly arise from the various enzymes used for liberation of pantothenic acid from coenzyme A, particularly the source of pantetheinase. A purified pantetheinase from pig kidney had greater than 100 times the specific activity and less than 0.01 times the pantothenate content of other commonly used extracts. Endogenous pantetheinase activity in human plasma was identified (11.2 +/- 2.0 mumol pantothenate .min-1.L-1, n = 29) and found comparable to the activity usually added from exogenous sources for liberation of pantothenate from whole blood (1-13 mumol.min-1.L-1). Alkaline phosphatase alone liberated as much pantothenate from hemolyzed whole blood as did alkaline phosphatase with pantetheinase. Previous reports of total blood pantothenate may be elevated by pantothenate in the pantetheinase extracts, an unnecessary source of error. Whole-blood total pantothenate concentrations less than 4.6 mumol/L are normal and do not indicate deficiency, as is often currently quoted.\r"

The effects of sodium chloride supplements of 0.51, and 102 mmol/d, randomly assigned to 17 healthy, noninstitutionalized, postmenopausal women consuming their usual diets were compared. Diets and discretionary salt intake were repeated exactly for three experimental periods of 4 d each for 3 consecutive weeks. Supplementing with 51 mmol NaCl/d increased average daily urinary excretion of Ca, Na, and Cl by 0.5, 51.0, and 48.9 mmol respectively, urine pH by 0.1, and serum Cl by 1.5 mmol/L (p less than 0.05). Supplementing with 102 mmol/d induced additional increases in these variables (p less than 0.05). Assuming a total body mass of 900 g Ca and no decrease in renal or fecal losses, additions of 51 and 102 mmol/d NaCl to the diet for 10 y would mobilize Ca stores of 7.5% and 10%, respectively, and could thus constitute a risk factor for osteoporosis.\r"

Impressive differences in death rates between groups are found especially at the 10- and 15-y anniversaries.

Total body density is used to estimate total body fat percentage by use of age- and sex-dependent equations on the relation between body fat percentage and body density. These equations are constructed on the basis of published data on changes in the density of fat-free mass with age in children. With the proposed method childhood obesity can be assessed routinely in a more consistent way than with most other routine methods used to diagnose obesity in children. A preliminary validation study indicated that in children aged 7-10 y predicted body density differed on average less than 1% from measured body density. In addition, predicted body density was highly correlated (r greater than 0.7) with measured body density.\r"

Weight and bioimpedance were measured daily for one cycle and sodium intake was assessed. The precision of bioimpedance measures was examined and subjects' average resistance, weight, Na intake, and calculated body composition during the four phases of menses were compared by using paired t tests. Significant differences were observed between phases 1 and 2 for R (p less than 0.001), weight (p less than 0.05), and fat-free mass (p less than 0.05) and differences were observed between phases 2 and 4 for R (p less than 0.05) and weight (p less than 0.05); no significant differences were observed for percent body fat. Changes in body weight (p less than 0.001) associated with Na intake explained a significant proportion of error in resistance measures. These data suggest the reliability of the BIA body composition approach during menses; small weight changes related to hydration status may, however, be a confounding influence.\r"

  ".W": "A recent development in the treatment of obesity is the widespread use of very-low-calorie diets. This study assessed the response to refeeding (RF) after semistarvation (SS) in a rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (440 g) were semistarved for 21 d, receiving a nutritionally complete defined formula diet at 23% of calories of control (C) rats fed ad libitum, and subsequently refed over 21 d (SS----RF). Organ weight, contents of protein and DNA, and the protein-DNA ratio were determined for the liver, pancreas, small intestine, and heart. Compared with C animals, SS----RF animals showed variable repletion of tissue protein but not of tissue DNA. The higher protein-DNA ratio shown in these organ systems suggests a cellular hypertrophic adaptive response to refeeding. A persistent reduced number of cells in ratio to protein concentration is evident despite refeeding over 21 d. Very-low-calorie diets as well as refeeding influence nitrogen economy of selected organ systems.\r"

The relation of several anthropometric measures to serum concentrations of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins was therefore examined in 361 children who were between ages 6 and 18 y. (Children had been selected previously because of extreme levels of very-low-density- and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol.) Analyses revealed two groups of anthropometric variables: truncal measures (waist circumference and subscapular, subcostal, and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses) and thickness of peripheral skinfolds (femoral, triceps, calf, and biceps). After generalized obesity was adjusted for children with high concentrations of both cholesterol fractions had more truncal fat but less peripheral fat than did children with low lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. A truncal fat pattern was also associated with decreased concentrations of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1. Knowledge of fat patterning may help identify persons prone to hyperlipidemia.\r"

No difference was found in indices indicating vitamin B-6 status or in plasma zinc or copper concentrations. Self-induced vomiting was the only significant predictor of upper-quartile vitamin A concentrations. Upper-quartile vitamin B-6 activations (indicating lower vitamin B-6 activity) were significantly predicted only by low actual body weight. These results suggest that supplementation of micronutrient intake needs only to be considered for those eating-disorder patients at low weight and then only with water-soluble vitamins.\r"

Underweight multiparas given zinc had longer gestational lengths (p = 0.008) than did subjects given the placebo. Multiple stepwise regression analysis, used to identify predictors of infant size, revealed that 14-26% more variance was accounted for in the zinc than in the placebo group. Except for gestational age, the predictors selected were entirely different in the two groups. The zinc group had a positive toxemia screen more often, which did not appear to affect outcome. Zinc supplementation improved pregnancy outcome in normal-weight women and in underweight multiparas. The nonresponse in underweight primiparas was perhaps due to multiple limiting factors.\r"

Trabecular bone density was related inversely to dietary fiber (r = -0.69, p = 0.02) and carbohydrate (r = -0.70, p = 0.02) and directly to serum free-and-albumin-bound testosterone (fab T) (r = -0.70, p = 0.02) and total testosterone (total T) (r = 0.66, p = 0.03). Dietary fiber was correlated negatively with fab T (r = -0.74, p = 0.009), total T (r = -0.70, p = 0.02), and androstenedione (Adione) (r = -0.72, p = 0.01). Controlling for the effect of fab T or Adione weakened the relationship between dietary fiber and bone density and the relationship was no longer statistically significant. Conversely, controlling for sex hormones did not abolish the effect of carbohydrate on bone density. The contributions of fab T and carbohydrate to bone density were independent. These results suggest that dietary fiber may depress serum androgens which in turn decrease trabecular bone density. Carbohydrate may also depress bone density but independently of sex steroid hormones.\r"

To determine if IGF-1 could be a useful nutritional index, 15 malnourished patients were assessed during nutritional support. Patients with protein or protein-calorie malnutrition had lower IGF-1 (39 +/- 7 micrograms/L) than did patients with calorie-only malnutrition (109 +/- 25 micrograms/L, p less than 0.005); transferrin concentrations did not differ between the two groups. Nutritional supplementation produced an increase in IGF-1 (123 +/- 32 micrograms/L, p less than 0.005); the relative increase in IGF-1 (264 +/- 62%, p less than 0.001) exceeded increases in albumin or transferrin (9 +/- 6% and 59 +/- 16%, NS and p less than 0.005, respectively). Reduction or termination of support was followed by a decrease in IGF-1 to 59 +/- 9% of peak values (p less than 0.001) but neither albumin nor transferrin decreased significantly. Changes in IGF-1 were correlated with nitrogen balance (r = 0.45, p less than 0.005). The strong relationship between IGF-1 and nutritional status suggests that IGF-1 determinations may be useful in guiding nutritional therapy in patients whose nitrogen balance is difficult to assess.\r"

Nutrition counseling was associated with improvements in dietary intake and significantly greater maternal weight gain (p less than 0.05). Mean birth weight was slightly higher in the intervention group but so was the incidence of low birth weight (4.5% vs 3.9%). The prematurity rate was marginally lower in the intervention group (p less than 0.04), as was the number of perinatal deaths (9 vs 11). The results indicate that nutrition counseling during pregnancy can improve dietary intake and maternal weight gain but the mediating influence on low frequency pregnancy outcomes is indeterminate in a population that is not nutritionally at risk.\r"

Because the erythrocyte membranes of formula-fed infants are depleted in long-chain PUFA, we sought food sources of these 20- and 22-carbon polyunsaturates suitable for use as dietary supplements. A variety of commercially available infant foods containing meats and egg products in addition to some whole foods (meat, eggs) were analyzed by gas chromatography. Commercially available infant foods contained only low levels of long-chain PUFA. The richest source of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA was found to be lamb brains but lamb and chicken livers as well as egg yolks also contained high levels. However, the lipid content of most whole foods including brains, eggs, and liver is so low that prohibitively large amounts of food would be required to be fed to infants. It is concluded that it is virtually impossible to supplement the diet of formula-fed infants to match the long-chain PUFA intake of breast-fed infants with currently available whole foods.\r"

During 3-d experimental diet periods, free-living subjects consumed either cocoa butter or corn oil as virtually the sole source of dietary fat, provided at 40% of the total energy intake in the form of specially formulated cookies. Fat absorption was determined by quantifying total fecal lipid excretion over the 3-d period. Total fecal lipid and fecal fatty acids were determined. The percentage of fat excreted was significantly higher (p less than or equal to 0.001) when subjects consumed the cocoa butter (10.8 +/- 3.2%) vs the corn oil (3.5 +/- 1.0%) diet. These results indicate that the digestibility of cocoa butter is significantly less than corn oil and may explain, in part, previous reports of a neutral effect of dietary cocoa butter on plasma cholesterol concentrations.\r"

No significant differences were found in TG, GOT, and GGT concentrations between the groups or during alcohol consumption or abstention.

It was also recently indicated that the concentration of acidic lipids in the aqueous phase of stool constitutes a risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Thus, we examined the effect of a change from a mixed to a lactovegetarian diet on this fecal variable. The dietary change caused a decrease in the total concentration of soluble fecal fatty acids (4310 +/- 3020 to 1080 +/- 1040 mumol/L, p less than 0.05) and deoxycholic acid (125 +/- 42 to 73 +/- 35 mumol/L, p less than 0.05). However, there was no change in either the total bile acid concentration in (164 +/- 54 to 107 +/- 41 mumol/L) or the cellular toxicity of (0.94 +/- 0.55 to 1.60 +/- 0.63 mumol/L, relative survival) the aqueous phase of stool. Thus, the consumption of a lactovegetarian diet may reduce certain risk factors of potential significance in colon carcinogenesis.\r"

N balances fluctuated around body N equilibrium. Immunological studies confirmed the absence of any allergic responses in these subjects.

Fourteen histologically similar primary tumors from different mesothelium-lined sites (11 pleural and 1 each in the pericardium, peritoneal cavity, and pouch of Douglas) and 2 recurrences of those tumors (pericardium and pouch of Douglas) were examined histopathologically and by flow cytometry to relate histologic features and DNA ploidy to biologic behavior (follow-up, 48-255 months among 13 patients). All 16 tumors (14 primaries and 2 recurrences) displayed diploid DNA pattern, and none of 13 patients died of disease (1 patient was lost to follow-up). To elucidate the histogenesis, seven primary tumors were examined for vimentin and keratin immunostaining and six primary tumors were assessed by electron microscopy. All cases exhibited spindle-fibroblastic cell proliferation with a prominent hemangiopericytic pattern. All cases so examined had positive results for vimentin and negative results for keratin. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells showed mesenchymal-fibroblastic features. These results support a mesenchymal origin, most likely from submesothelial fibroblasts. Further, this neoplasm may recur but retain its basic histologic features, diploidy, and benign outcome.\r"

To determine the utility of immunohistochemistry in the differentiation of sarcomatoid malignant mesotheliomas from other spindle cell neoplasms, the authors studied the immunostaining patterns of nine antibodies in four sarcomatoid mesotheliomas, one desmoplastic mesothelioma, two epithelial mesotheliomas, four spindle cell squamous carcinomas, and eight sarcomas of various differentiation. Three of the four sarcomatoid mesotheliomas and the desmoplastic mesothelioma had positive results for cytokeratin, which distinguishes them from sarcomas but not from spindle cell squamous carcinomas. The immunostaining pattern of 14 examples of benign spindle cell mesothelial proliferation was similar to that of the sarcomatoid mesotheliomas, which supports the theory that these tumors are mesothelial in origin. Although other antibodies occasionally may be helpful, depending on the differentiation of the sarcoma, cytokeratin immunostaining appears to be the best method to discriminate sarcomatoid mesotheliomas from sarcomas.\r"

Both PCT and normal pancreas are able to specifically bind 3H-estradiol. This binding almost exclusively results from the presence of high levels of type II ER, whereas type I ERs were absent or present at very low levels. Both normal and neoplastic pancreas studied immunohistochemically for the presence of nuclear ER had negative results. This could be explained assuming that anti-ER antibodies are specific for type I binding sites. In conclusion, the presence of specific estrogen as well as progesterone binding may explain the sex and age predilection of PCT and suggest a possible hormone sensitivity for this tumor.\r"

  ".W": "Certain human papillomavirus (HPV) types (such as type 16) have been linked to high-grade precancers and invasive carcinomas of the cervix. However, the accuracy with which morphologic characteristics will predict the presence and type of HPV infection is controversial. Three pathologists independently classified 102 consecutive cervical biopsies with the use of specific criteria and correlated their findings with the presence of HPV 11, 16, and 18 RNA sequences by in situ hybridization. Based on the presence and distribution of nuclear atypia, abnormal mitotic figures, and koilocytosis, biopsies were classified into borderline condyloma, condyloma, borderline cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) with koilocytotic atypia (CINK), and CIN. Two or more observers agreed on the diagnosis in 96% of cases. HPV 16-related sequences alone were detected in 0% of borderline condylomata, 17% of flat condylomata, 43% of borderline CINK, 67% of CINK, and 77% of CIN lesions. Other HPVs, including those producing signals with more than one probe, were present in 0, 50, 14, 9, and 0% of these lesions, respectively. The authors data suggest that consistent identification of HPV-related cervical disease requires the presence of specific cytologic changes. In the authors' series, when HPV-related disease is present, CIN is the most common lesion and most (71%) contain HPV 16-related nucleic acids. Thus, a high proportion (88%) of histologic abnormalities associated with HPV-16 could be distinguished as CIN by morphologic characteristics alone, and this distinction could be made by most observers.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the frequency of talc microcrystals in liver tissue of intravenous (IV) drug abusers and the significance of this finding, the authors reviewed, with light and polarizing microscopy, sections of liver tissue from 70 patients with chronic hepatitis and a history of active (45) or past (25) IV drug abuse. Birefringent crystalline particles consistent with talc were found in 44 cases (63%), 31 associated with active and 13 with past drug abuse. The microcrystals were situated predominantly in hypertrophied portal macrophages; there were no well-formed granulomas. Scanning electron microscopic and energy-dispersive spectrophotometry performed on eight of the positive cases showed the characteristic \"flake-pastry\" appearance and chemical composition (silicon and magnesium) of talc. For comparison, the authors similarly examined 70 cases of posttransfusion chronic hepatitis, all of which had negative findings for talc, and 70 cases of chronic hepatitis with no documented risk factors for viral hepatitis, of which two had positive findings for talc, even though IV drug abuse was denied by the two patients. The authors conclude that talc is frequently present in the liver of IV drug abusers and whenever encountered it strongly suggests IV drug abuse. Only two patients (1.4%) with a negative history also had talc.\r"

Fever of unknown origin and thrombocytopenia were common in ARC, but anemia and leukopenia were most frequent in AIDS. Changes in stromal cells and perivascular cuffing of plasma cells were found significantly more often in patients with AIDS than in those with ARC. Malignancies were common in both groups. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nucleic acids were detected with the use of a 3H-labeled cDNA probe with an in situ hybridization method in 11 bone marrow samples (three ARC and eight AIDS). Most commonly positive cells were mononucleated, resembling lymphocytes and histiocytes. Endothelial cells, interdigitating reticulum cells, nucleated red blood cells, and immature myeloid cells also had positive results in some instances. The number of HIV-positive cells was not related to the size of the bone biopsies or the clinical diagnoses. The authors postulate that changes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of these patients may be related to latent persistent infection with HIV.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative laboratory quality measures include test accuracy and precision. To be useful, however, tests also must be available in a timely manner. The authors surveyed 757 University of California, Los Angeles, house officers (485-64% responded) regarding their expectations of laboratory test turnaround time for five test groups that are regularly offered both stat and routine. They compared expectations with actual laboratory performance by evaluating turnaround time for 42,414 consecutive laboratory requests received over two weeks. The authors' laboratory performed 45% of studied analytes stat. Median turnaround time was 44 minutes for stat and 119 minutes for routine tests, although variation exists by test group. The percentage of time their laboratory met median stat and routine turnaround time expectations varies by shift and work area. Timeliness of results often may be as important as accuracy and precision in assuring quality of care and cost-effective use of hospital services. Although the laboratory may not meet current housestaff turnaround time expectations, it is unclear whether laboratory performance is inadequate or housestaff expectations are unreasonable. Publicizing actual routine turnaround times may reduce the number of stat requests ordered if routine turnaround times are incorrectly perceived to be too slow. Reduction in stat test ordering may improve overall laboratory performance and turnaround time. The authors recommend that clinical pathologists and clinicians together develop turnaround time goals based on practicality, medical necessity, and clinician expectations.\r"

Methemoglobin did not interfere with the assay. The observed first derivative maxima and minima were reproducible but instrument dependent. The authors applied this technique to the measurement of serum hemoglobin in 100 healthy human subjects. They observed a geometric mean value of 68 mg/L (6.8 mg/dL) with the actual range 21-189 mg/L (2.1-18.9 mg/dL).

  ".W": "Rheumatoid factors (RFs) have been traditionally detected by the agglutination of IgG-coated particles such as latex beads or erythrocytes. These agglutination assays are only semiquantitative and do not detect materials other than pentameric IgM RF. In order to optimize a quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for IgM RF that could be used for detecting small amounts of IgM RF in materials derived from large numbers of biologic fluids, several steps were investigated. In comparison with an ELISA using a peroxidase-conjugated antibody, substitution of a biotinylated antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin led to a steeper slope of absorbance versus U/mL of RF without increasing the background. By using as a chromogenic substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) instead of o-phenylenediamine (OPD), an even steeper slope and a lower background were achieved. The biotin-streptavidin ELISA proved to be more sensitive than a commercial latex agglutination test and similar in sensitivity to a screening slide-agglutination test using IgG-coated human erythrocytes. When sera that had had positive results in tube-dilution assays both with sensitized human erythrocytes and sensitized sheep erythrocytes were compared with other sera with positive results for only agglutination of sensitized human cells but not sheep, the group with positive results for both tube dilution assays had higher IgM RF levels by ELISA than those in the group with only the positive assay for sensitized human cells.\r"

On addition of Ehrlich's reagent, the color is more intense than that produced in the Watson-Schwartz test, and its spectrum more closely resembles that of pure PBG. By measuring the absorbance of this solution at 555 nm, it is possible to discriminate between urine samples with 9 mumol/L (2 mg/L) of PBG and those with no detectable PBG. The new screening test had positive results in two patients with latent acute intermittent porphyria; the Watson-Schwartz test had negative results in both cases. This procedure is easy to perform, has much greater sensitivity than the Watson-Schwartz test, and uses objective spectrophotometric data to separate positive from negative results.\r"

The increased nuclear absorbance observed in neoplastic cells is hypothesized to result from the disruption of hydrogen bonds between the DNA base pairs, which allows unwinding of the double helix and loss of the normal control of mitosis.\r"

Immunohistochemical ER was assessed in 68 breast carcinomas, by an automated method using routinely processed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, and manually with the use of snap-frozen tissues with a monoclonal anti-ER and peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. The paraffin sections were digested with DNase to enhance development of signal. Positive nuclear ER was obtained in 9 (13%) fixed tissues and 36 (53%) frozen tissues. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of a positive test result, as compared with the biochemical assay, were 25%, 100%, and 100% for the paraffin section technique, and 89%, 88%, and 89% for the frozen sections. Although it is specific, lack of sensitivity, resulting from loss of ER with fixation and room temperature handling, renders this immunohistochemical technique unacceptable on fixed tissues. However, ER immunostain on frozen tissue is an acceptable alternative to biochemical assay.\r"

Personal attitudes toward authorization of an autopsy on a member of the respondent's family or on his or her own body did not differ from declared professional attitudes.

Despite immunosuppressive therapy, the transplant was acutely rejected and had to be explanted on the twelfth day. Morphologic and immunohistochemical investigations on subsequent biopsies taken from the small bowel transplant were carried out. Besides typical changes in epithelial cells and the presence of T-cell infiltrates and Ig-deposits in vessels, many macrophages were seen. The submucosa in particular was invaded before rejection by numerous macrophages with positive results of antimonocyte/macrophage antibodies Ki-M6 and Ki-M7. The number of the macrophage antibodies Ki-M6 and Ki-M7. The number of the monocyte/macrophage cells and the immunohistochemical characteristics of the same may be important parameters for monitoring small bowel transplantations.\r"

  ".W": "The authors describe two women with locally infiltrative neoplasms of the nipple that exhibited sweat duct differentiation. The findings are compared with those previously recorded for syringomatous adenoma of the nipple. The patients presented with firm, subareolar nodules. Nests, cords, and ducts composed of cytologically uniform squamous cells were dispersed throughout the dermis and also involved subcutaneous tissue and adjacent breast parenchyma. Small keratocysts formed a minor component of the lesions. Additional observations in the present study included connections between tumor and epidermis; distinctive fibrous stroma; sparse mitotic figures; perineural invasion; carcinoembryomic antigen in luminal content and periluminal cytoplasm; tumor cells that contained S-100 protein; and Langerhans' cells within neoplastic cellular aggregates. Neither of the lesions had recurred after follow-up of 9 and 12 months. The foregoing neoplasms of the nipple appear to be part of a family of microscopically similar tumors that have a predilection for the face, breast and possibly the axilla and salivary tissue. Although capable of local recurrence, syringomatous tumors of the nipple and related lesions at other sites have not been reported to metastasize.\r"

Group 3 consisted of 63 subjects (38 boys, 25 girls) with short normal stature. Blood samples were drawn every 20 minutes over 24 hours, and the mean GH concentration, nocturnal GH concentration, diurnal GH concentration, pulse amplitude, and number of pulses with a GH peak above 5 micrograms/L were determined. The values for mean height, height velocity, bone age to chronological age ratio, somatomedin C concentration, GH concentration, nocturnal GH concentration, diurnal GH concentration, pulse amplitude, and number of pulses with a GH peak over 5 micrograms/L were significantly greater in group 3 than in group 2, and these same values, except for the mean diurnal GH concentration, were greater in group 2 than in group 1. The mean GH concentration correlated with the mean nocturnal GH concentration. Subjects in groups 1 and 2 were treated with GH for 1.23 +/- 0.53 years (mean +/- SD). All the group 1 subjects and 27 (87%) of the group 2 subjects responded with an increase in height velocity greater than 2 SDs per year of therapy. In conclusion, 87% of subjects with a normal GH response to provocative stimuli testing who had a mean height velocity of less than 4 cm/y, mean height lower than the third percentile, mean bone age to chronological age ratio of less than 0.8, and mean GH concentration less than 3 micrograms/L responded to GH therapy.\r"

Information obtained by structured interviews with the families and physicians and from the medical records was used to characterize (1) the patient, family, severity, and treatment of asthma primarily in the 6 months before the attack and (2) medical circumstances and patient characteristics present on the day of and/or during the acute episode. Patients in the study (mean age, 14.1 years) and controls (mean age, 13.8 years) were in early to late adolescence, had similar long-term medication use histories and an overall rating of the severity of asthma. For the analysis of the information concerning the 6 months before the attacks, the study patients had a greater frequency of respiratory failure requiring intubation, a decrease in steroid use in the month before the attack, history of family disturbance, abnormal reaction to separation or loss, and expressed hopelessness and despair. For the period more immediately surrounding the acute attack, study patients more often had attacks starting during sleep, but less frequently experienced vomiting during the course of the attacks. Treatment of the attack by the parents was poor (primarily because of delays) in 7 of the 12 children who died, but was also a factor in 6 of the 12 controls. Our data suggest that certain characteristics of asthmatic children may place them at greater risk for death due to their asthma. In addition, we postulate that there may be inherent differences in the mechanisms of the acute attacks between the children who died and those who survived.\r"

The data were obtained from an ongoing hospital-based monitoring system. Seventy percent of the sample sustained a head or face injury. Upper-torso and extremity injuries were infrequent. Lower torso injuries occurred primarily in frontal impacts in both the back and front seats. Frontal impacts resulted in a greater proportion of serious injuries than rear impacts. The most serious injuries, however, occurred to children seated on the side of impact in lateral collisions. Questions must be raised regarding the appropriateness of the present restraint system for young children. Recommendations, given current seat belt systems, are provided. However, technological improvements in vehicle design and belt systems are needed to improve protection, particularly in lateral impacts.\r"

Almost half of the subjects (22 of 45) acquired binge eating patterns after hospitalization. Overall, 86% had a satisfactory outcome.

We measured hearing thresholds from 250 to 20,000 Hz in 22 patients with cystic fibrosis who were treated with aminoglycosides. The audiograms were age-matched and were compared with those from 13 patients with cystic fibrosis and 38 subjects without cystic fibrosis, all of whom had never received aminoglycoside therapy. In patients with cystic fibrosis who were treated with aminoglycosides (younger than 20 years), there were statistically significant elevations only in frequencies higher than 16,000 Hz. Patients with cystic fibrosis who were treated with aminoglycosides who were 20 years and older had elevated thresholds in all frequencies tested. Patients with cystic fibrosis who were not treated with aminoglycosides did not differ statistically from controls. High-frequency audiometry may serve as a useful measure of elevation in pure-tone hearing thresholds that precede noticeable loss of auditory acuity in patients with cystic fibrosis who are receiving long-term aminoglycoside therapy.\r"

Examining a fasting blood sample for levels of carnitine, glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, and a urine sample for levels of ketones and glucose, we found 13 children were deficient of free carnitine (less than 20 mumol/L) and 30 had elevated acyl carnitine levels (greater than 11 mumol/L). Statistical tests confirmed a significant difference between the diabetic population and normal population for reduced free carnitine, elevated acyl carnitine, and an elevated ratio of acyl carnitine to free carnitine. Also, a significant correlation was found between the levels of urine glucose and ketones and the level of acyl carnitine. Our data indicate that carnitine deficiency and relative insufficiency may be an overlooked component in the management of diabetes.\r"

The pH was altered in 4 of the 5 subsets by adding various concentrations of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The pH levels studied ranged from 7.09 to 7.63. The phosphate concentration was altered in each subset by adding various concentrations of a phosphate buffer. The phosphate concentrations studied ranged between 0.81 and 3.58 mmol/L. There was an inverse relationship between ionized calcium and phosphate at all pH levels studied. The ionized calcium concentration correlated inversely with pH. We suggest that in addition to factors well known to influence serum ionized calcium concentration (such as protein, bicarbonate, and pH values), serum phosphate concentration also plays an important role.\r"

The total serum AP and serum zinc concentrations were determined serially at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in 72 infants with mean (+/- SEM) birth weights of 1000 +/- 29 g and gestational ages of 28.6 +/- 0.3 weeks. Twenty-four of 72 infants had radiographic evidence of rickets and/or fractures (R/F). In infants with R/F, group mean (+/- SEM) serum AP (371 +/- 42 U/L) and serum zinc (12.5 +/- 1.0 mumol/L) concentrations were significantly higher at 3 months compared with infants in the non-R/F group (193 +/- 12 U/L and 9.6 +/- 0.3 mumol/L, respectively). During the study, the serum AP concentrations decreased, and the serum zinc concentrations increased; both stabilized after 6 months. The serum AP concentrations were not related to the serum zinc concentrations. We speculate that in preterm infants, an increased bone turnover and a release of tissue (bone) zinc may contribute to the higher group mean serum AP and serum zinc concentrations at the time of diagnoses in infants with R/F compared with those infants without R/F.\r"

There were four deaths and one late death. Thirty-six patients had partial AVSD (pAVSD), 5 (14%) of whom had DS; all 5 patients are still alive. Thirty (97%) of the 31 patients with pAVSD without DS survived the operation. There were two late deaths. Preoperative selection did not account for the favorable results in children with DS. All early postoperative deaths in cAVSD occurred in children younger than 2 years; low body weight for age seemed to be an important factor in adverse outcome. A large number of patients without DS had other serious congenital malformations. In view of the relatively favorable results in patients with DS, it does not seem warranted to maintain a conservative diagnostic and therapeutic approach of AVSD solely because of concomitant DS.\r"

  ".W": "When 10 diabetic (five insulin-dependent) subjects with reasonable glycemic control were randomized from their usual (U) diet (about 30 g fiber/day) between two different but isocaloric high fiber diets, each sequentially over 6 wk [HF (55 g fiber/day) and HFS (55 g fiber/day with sucrose taken as 15 g three times daily, with meals)], plasma acetate (mmol/L) increased by 35% on both high fiber diets from 0.21 +/- 0.06 (SD) to 0.28 +/- 0.10 (HF) and 0.30 +/- 0.10 (HFS) (both p less than 0.01). This was higher than the random weekly variation in plasma acetate levels of 11% in six other glycemically stable diabetic patients. When the acetate value was expressed as acetate/glucose, i.e., relative to the fasting glucose level (since fasting levels of acetate and glucose consistently positively correlate), the increase was about 80%. Fasting plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels fell during the high fiber diets and correlated negatively with the fasting acetate level (rs -0.51, p less than 0.005). The fall in NEFA and rise in acetate levels appeared greatest with the sucrose-supplemented meals. These results suggest increased exogenous contribution to the plasma acetate level from increased colonic fermentation of dietary fiber and raise the possibility of using such measurements in the assessment of compliance to high fiber diets. The fall in NEFA levels associated with raised plasma acetate levels may contribute to the beneficial effects on glycemic control observed with the high fiber diets.\r"

Hemorrhagic pancreatitis was found in all MHA-positive patients who were subject to surgery or postmortem examination. By way of comparison, the presence of more than four Ranson signs was associated with about the same risk of mortality and the development of complications as positive MHA findings.

We have investigated the possible effects of TAE on the pancreas by monitoring serum pancreatic enzyme activities following TAE with various embolic materials. Serum amylase activity was increased very little in the patients treated with chemotherapy alone or plus TAE with lipiodol, slightly increased in many of the patients treated with chemotherapy plus TAE with gelatin sponge, and increased in all of the patients treated with chemotherapy plus TAE with gelfoam powder. The activity was increased to a level as high as 700 U/dl or more in most individuals of the last category. In one of them acute pancreatitis developed, probably because the gelfoam powder regurgitated into the pancreaticoduodenal artery, and occluded a very peripheral portion of the pancreatic vascular bed, leading to ischemia of the pancreas. These results suggest that choosing the correct particle size is important for prevention of acute pancreatitis.\r"

The levels of PGI2, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and leukotrienes showed no significant differences between the two groups. These changes were not present in individuals heterozygous for the cystic fibrosis gene. Study of appropriate control groups suggested that the changes that we observed in patients with cystic fibrosis could not be attributed to their lung disease or to the medications these patients were receiving.

The investigation was performed on 10 subjects whose hemorrhage had ceased either spontaneously or after pharmacological treatment for at least 24-36 h. The following therapeutic regimens were randomly evaluated: bolus infusions of ranitidine (100 mg/6 h and 50 mg/4 h) and cimetidine (400 mg/6 h and 200 mg/4 h) and continuous infusions of ranitidine (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg/h) and cimetidine (100 mg/h). Each study evaluated at least two consecutive boli or an 8-h continuous infusion. All treatments produced significant elevations in the basal intragastric pH (p less than 0.001). With bolus administrations, however, the pH displayed consistent oscillations. The pH fell below 4 approximately 6 h after the administration in all the patients treated with 400 mg of cimetidine and in three treated with 50 mg of ranitidine. The administration of histamine H2-receptor antagonists every 4 h allowed better control of intragastric acidity. The pH dropped below 4 in seven of the 10 patients in the 4-h period after the administration of 200 mg cimetidine, and in one of the 10 patients treated with 50 mg of ranitidine/4 h. Increasing bolus dose did not reduce the time lapse or increase the inhibition of intragastric acidity. Continuous infusions were efficacious in maintaining pH values constantly above 6. Ranitidine (0.2 mg/kg/h) achieved the same inhibitory efficiency as cimetidine (100 mg/h). These data indicate that continuous venous infusion of both ranitidine and cimetidine is significantly more efficacious than repeated single bolus administrations.\r"

At autopsy, intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma was found at the left lateral segment of the liver. The cancer was extensively disseminated to the peritoneal cavity. In addition, the liver harbored a cholesterol stone (1.0 cm in diameter) impacted in the right peripheral bile duct, as well as tiny cholesterol stones (0.1-0.2 cm in diameter) scattered in the intrahepatic peripheral bile ducts. A few tiny cholesterol stones were also present in the cancerous bile ducts.

The clearance curve of AHS-IgA from the circulation, calculated by measuring trichloroacetic acid precipitable radioactivity in serum, was found to be biexponential with an initial fast component significantly prolonged in patients (mean half-time, 19.4 minutes, range, 14 to 26 minutes) compared with controls (mean, 12.2 minutes, range, 7.6 to 16.8 minutes; P less than 0.01).

Apart from confirming the frequently relapsing course and mild glomerular changes observed in patients with IgA nephropathy and steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), we were able to show that mesangial expansion and mesangial IgA deposits disappeared or were greatly reduced in repeat renal biopsies following steroid-induced remission. Because mesangial IgA deposits usually persist in repeat biopsies obtained from patients with typical IgA nephropathy, their resolution in our patients following steroid remission would support the proposal that the association of IgA nephropathy and SRNS may represent a distinct clinical syndrome. It is postulated that the presence of mesangial IgA deposits during nephrotic presentation and their disappearance following steroid-induced remission may result from increased mesangial sequestration of IgA circulating immune complexes (CIC) during the period of enhanced glomerular permeability and that the increased load of IgA CICs may reflect a common defect in mucosal immunity or immunoregulation in these patients.\r"

This type of ARF is characterized by necrosis of medullary thick ascending limbs (mTALs). Uninephrectomized, salt-depleted rats injected with indomethacin (10 mg/kg) develop ARF following the administration of the radiocontrast agent, iothalamate. Furosemide (20 mg/kg, intravenous), administered immediately before the contrast material, attenuated the severity of ARF and reduced mTAL necrosis. Treatment with furosemide and/or normal saline prevented both the decline in renal function and mTAL injury. It is concluded that furosemide and normal saline may ameliorate the course of ARF if administered before radiocontrast.\r"

The mean rate of progression expressed as the slope of the reciprocal creatinine versus time was -0.0054 +/- 0.0009 dL/mg/mo (mean +/- SEM), and the median was -0.00315 dL/mg/mo. Approximately 25% of these patients had rates of progression less than -0.001 dL/mg/mo. The rate of progression was inversely correlated with the creatinine concentration at entry (P less than 0.004) and with the frequency of clinic visits (P less than 0.01). The \"renal survival\" time from a creatinine of 880 mumol/L (10 mg/dL) to dialysis was 10.0 +/- 1.2 months (mean +/- SEM). These data provide rates of progression for a group of patients without specific dietary intervention but with vigorous control of blood pressure and phosphorus.\r"

Nephrologists who have the majority of their visits with ESRD patients average more than 120 patient encounters per week, approximating the practice workloads of primary care physicians. Nephrologists spend comparable amounts of time providing treatment for ESRD and non-ESRD patients in the same settings, schedule additional office visits for facility dialysis patients, and provide treatment and advice for problems not related to dialysis. Whereas care for acute renal failure patients is primarily based on consultations and involves a narrow focus, treatment for ESRD involves the provision of comprehensive primary medical care by nephrologists to their patients being treated with dialysis.\r"

  ".U": "90053578\r", 
  ".W": "T10B9.1A-31 is an immunoglobulin Mk (lgMk), CD3b class, murine monoclonal antibody. It is not itself mitogenic, but it partially blocks mitogenesis produced by concanavilin-A, phytohemagglutinin, and a soluble antigen cocktail and is lytic for human peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PB-T) in the presence of fresh autologous human complement and rabbit complement. It reacts with a monomorphic epitope found on all mature PB-Ts that modulates in vitro and in vivo with the CD3/T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex, but unlike OKT3, which reacts with CD3 proteins, T10B9.1A-31 reacts with an epitope of the TCR alpha/beta heterodimer. Immunoprecipitation of HPB-ALL with T10B9.1A-31 or OKT3 revealed that T10B9.1A-31 does not react with the 20-to 26-kd polypeptides that compose CD3, and T10B9.1A-31 failed to bind to the PEER cell, which is CD3 gamma/delta positive, TCR alpha/beta negative. Phase 1 clinical trials demonstrated that T10B9.1A-31 caused a rapid decrease in PB-Ts and no toxic effects other than fever, chills, rigors, and transient hypotension. These side effects were absent in methylprednisolone (MP)-pretreated patients. Phase II studies revealed that T10B9.1A-31 reversed steroid refractory acute rejection in three of five renal allografts treated with cyclosporine (CyA) and prednisone (P) maintenance immunosuppression, reversed steroid and polyclonal antisera refractory rejection in three cardiac allograft recipients receiving CyA/P, and attenuated acute rejection in three of three renal patients receiving baseline azathioprine/prednisone (AZA/P) when used as primary therapy. Rerejection was not seen when patients received CyA baseline immunosuppression but was seen in patients maintained on AZA/P OKT3 was efficacious in treating rejection following T10B9.1A-31 therapy. Side effects of T10B9.1A-31 appears to reverse acute rejection crisis effectively in renal and cardiac transplantation with a low incidence of rerejection in CyA-maintained patients and with fewer, milder side effects. Sequential therapy with OKT3 is possible because OKT3 and T10B9.1A-31 are of different isotypes and idiotypes.\r"

Individual exons of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene with flanking introns were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into M13 for sequence analysis. An Arg111-to-Ter111 mutation has been identified in exon 3 of the PAH gene in a Chinese PKU patient. The mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with the mutant haplotype 4 alleles which are the most prevalent haplotype among the Orientals. The mutation accounts for about 10% of the Chinese PKU alleles and is absent from the Caucasians, demonstrating that independent mutational events have occurred in the PAH locus after racial divergence.\r"

Three large families with AO were analyzed for clinical manifestations of the disease and for coinheritance of the genetic defect with RFLPs in the type II procollagen gene (COL2A1). Genetic linkage between AO and COL2A1 was demonstrated in the largest family, with a maximum LOD score of 3.52 at a recombination distance of zero. Data from a second family also supported linkage of AO and COL2A1, with a LOD score of 1.20 at a recombination distance of zero. These results are consistent with the conclusion that mutations in the COL2A1 gene are responsible for AO in these two families. In a third AO family, however, recombination between AO and COL2A1 occurred in at least one meiosis, and the data were inconclusive with respect to linkage.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of adult female carriers of the fragile X chromosome indicate that certain psychological problems occur with a greater frequency and severity than expected. This study examines the association of parental origin of the fragile X chromosome and of fragility detected in the karyotype with measures of social, educational, and psychological functioning in a group of adult fragile X females of normal intelligence. The results show that, as a group, women who inherit the fragile X chromosome from their mother and who demonstrate positive fragility in the karyotype (MI+ group = [maternal inheritance with positive fragility]) manifest significantly more impairment of social, educational, and psychological functioning when compared with fragile X females with paternal inheritance or negative fragility or with a matched control group comprising non-fragile X women. In particular, MI+ women show lower levels of both educational achievement and socioeconomic status and a greater degree of disturbance in communication, socialization, affect, and thought processes. These clinical findings are consistent with the recently advanced hypothesis which proposes that a two-stage process leading to chromosome imprinting in a preoogonial cell causes the fragile X syndrome.\r"

The mother has patchy fundal hypopigmentation consistent with random X inactivation in an OA1 carrier. Additional phenotypic abnormalities that have been observed in other STS \"deletion syndromes\" are not present in this family. STS is entirely deleted on Southern blot in the affected males, but the loci MIC2X, DXS31, DXS143, DXS85, DXS43, DXS9, and DXS41 are not deleted. At least part of DXS278 is retained. Flow cytometric analysis of cultured lymphoblasts from one of the XI/OA1 males and his mother detected a deletion of about 3.5 million bp or about 2% of the X chromosome. Southern blot and RFLP analysis in the XI/OA1 family support the order tel-[STS-OA1-DXS278]-DXS9-DXS41-cen. An unrelated patient with the karyotype 46,X,t(X;Y) (p22;q11) retains the DXS143 locus on the derivative X chromosome but loses DXS278, suggesting that DXS278 is the more distal locus and is close to an XI/OA1 deletion boundary. If a contiguous gene deletion is responsible for the observed XI/OA1 phenotype, it localizes OA1 to the Xp22.3 region.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of cryopreservation on the frequency and type of chromosome abnormalities in human sperm have been investigated for the first time. With a technique which enables direct visualization of human sperm chromosomes following in vitro penetration of hamster oocytes, sperm samples from 13 normal men were examined before and after being frozen in liquid nitrogen. The overall abnormality frequencies of 17.8% for fresh semen and 13.4% for previously frozen semen were not significantly different (chi 2(1) df = 3.04, p = 0.08). When specific abnormality types were analyzed, only the category of hypohaploidy was significantly different (chi 2(1) df = 6.75, p = 0.009) before (7.5%) and after (3.4%) freezing. Hypohaploidy was significantly higher than hyperhaploidy both prefreeze and postfreeze, and chromosome loss was random. Because the observed excess of hypohaploid cells may be attributable to technical artifact, the aneuploidy levels were estimated by doubling the number of hyperhaploid cells. Neither the adjusted numerical abnormality frequencies (1% prefreeze vs. 0% postfreeze) nor the overall abnormality frequencies (11.8% prefreeze vs. 10.4% postfreeze) were significantly different. The types and distributions of karyotypically abnormal sperm complements (numerical, structural, or combined) observed before and after freezing were not different. Interdonor variability in sperm chromosome abnormality frequencies and a possible donor-dependent response to cryopreservation were suggested by the data. The sex ratios were not affected by cryopreservation and did not differ significantly from the theoretical 50%. It is concluded that cryopreservation does not affect the type or frequencies of chromosome abnormalities or alter the sex ratio in human sperm.\r"

These macromolecules belong to a large family of related sequences known as the G protein-coupled receptors. The D2 receptors have been of special interest because they bind, with high affinity and specificity, many of the commonly prescribed antipsychotic drugs. We previously isolated a full-length cDNA clone of the rat D2 receptor. When a chromosome mapping panel was probed with the rat D2 receptor cDNA a 15-kb EcoRI restriction fragment was identified and localized to human chromosome 11. The rat cDNA was also used to clone a human genomic fragment, lambda hD2G1, which contains the last coding exon of the D2 receptor gene (DRD2) and 16.5 kb of 3' flanking sequence. Hybridization of lambda hD2G1 to a chromosome 11 regional mapping panel localized DRD2 to 11q. In situ hybridization of lambda hD2G1 to metaphase chromosomes refined this assignment to the q22-q23 junction of chromosome 11. A search for RFLPs associated with D2DR identified a frequent two-allele TaqI RFLP.\r"

Data were available on a sample of 466 individuals in 158 nuclear families from Nancy, France. Longitudinal data analyses were carried out on 128 unrelated adults and 56 unrelated children. We estimate the relative frequencies of the epsilon 2, epsilon 3, and epsilon 4 apolipoprotein E alleles in this population to be .120, .764, and .116, respectively. There is no significant evidence from these data that supports an effect of the apolipoprotein E polymorphism on the longitudinal profile of any of the variables considered. There is a significant interaction between the effects of this gene and weight change on the longitudinal change of serum triglyceride and beta lipoprotein levels in adults. In conjunction with weight gain, individuals with an epsilon 4 allele are expected to show a larger increase in triglyceride levels (0.15 +/- 0.03 mmol/L/kg) compared with individuals with no epsilon 4 allele. An increased production of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) as one gains weight, along with retarded VLDL clearance attributable to the effects of the epsilon 4 allele, may account for this results. The significant interaction between the apolipoprotein E polymorphism and changes in weight on the longitudinal change in triglyceride levels corroborates epidemiological studies reporting that the epsilon 4 allele increases the risk of hypertriglyceridemia among obese individuals.\r"

It is suggested that a traditional approach to such modeling and hypothesis testing, whereby competing models are \"nested\" in an effort to simplify their probabilistic assessment, can be complimented by an alternative statistical paradigm - the separate-families-of-hypotheses approach to segregation analysis. Two bootstrap-based methods are described that allow testing of any two, possibly non-nested, parametric genetic hypotheses. These procedures utilize a strategy in which the unknown distribution of a likelihood ratio-based test statistic is simulated, thereby allowing the estimation of critical values for the test statistic. Though the focus of this paper concerns quantitative traits, the strategies described can be applied to qualitative traits as well. The conceptual advantages and computational ease of these strategies are discussed, and their significance levels and power are examined through Monte Carlo experimentation. It is concluded that the separate-families-of-hypotheses approach, when carried out with the methods described in this paper, not only possesses some favorable statistical properties but also is well suited for genetic segregation analysis.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Appropriateness of triage decisions was measured using explicit and implicit judgments. RESULTS: Application of an admission triage rule (partially based on the Brush electrocardiographic criteria) would have increased coronary care unit (CCU) admissions by 3%, whereas application of a triage rule 24 hours after admission would have reduced bed utilization by 860 intermediate care and 82 CCU bed-days per year when compared with actual patient triage. Although 9.5% of patients who underwent triage according to the early transfer triage rule would have experienced a minor complication after transfer, the medical care of none would have been adversely affected. CONCLUSION: Our results show that application of a triage rule 24 hours after admission may have the potential to shorten length of stay in the CCU and intermediate care unit without significantly compromising patient care. However, use of the admission triage rule would have increased CCU bed utilization. The failure of the admission triage rule to improve bed utilization illustrates the potential hazards of ignoring patient complications, interventions, and co-morbidity when predicting the efficacy of a triage rule.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 141 consecutive autologous bone marrow transplant recipients were evaluated. In 29 patients, a clinical syndrome characterized by progressive dyspnea, hypoxia, cough, diffuse consolidation on chest roentgenography, and characteristic bronchoalveolar lavage findings developed over one to seven days. RESULTS: In 29 patients, bronchoalveolar lavage performed by sequential instillation and aspiration of 20-ml aliquots of normal saline resulted in recovered lavage fluid that became progressively bloodier with each recovered aliquot. Autopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage in these patients revealed no pathogens that accounted for the clinical findings. Since the later aliquots sample predominantly alveolar material, this syndrome was termed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). DAH was associated with a high inpatient mortality rate (23 of 29 died versus 14 of 112 without DAH, p less than 0.001) and was associated with age over 40 years, solid malignancies, high fevers, severe mucositis, white blood cell recovery, and renal insufficiency (p less than 0.05, compared with patients without DAH). However, DAH was not associated with prolonged prothrombin or partial thromboplastin times or decreased platelet counts compared with patients without DAH. CONCLUSION: DAH is a frequent cause of respiratory compromise and a major cause of mortality in autologous bone marrow transplant recipients.\r"

After 18 weeks of either the LAC or the placebo diet, patients returned to a totally unrestricted diet for 12 weeks (washout period) and crossed over to the second half of the study for the other 18 weeks. RESULTS: After three weeks of the restricted LAC diet, the cryocrit decreased from 3.5 +/- 3.4% (mean +/- SD) to 2.3 +/- 2.0% (p less than 0.01), and the circulating immune complex levels decreased from 48 +/- 30% to 39 +/- 34% (p less than 0.01). At the same time, the purpura score (p less than 0.05), glutamic pyruvic transaminase level (p less than 0.01), and gamma glutamyl transferase level (p less than 0.001) significantly improved. Splenic reticuloendothelial function, measured as the half-life of heat-damaged autologous red cells, decreased from 41 +/- 21 minutes to 21 +/- 10 minutes (p less than 0.005). In contrast, no significant parallel clinical, biochemical, and immunologic changes occurred in the same patients during the placebo (standard normocaloric) diet. CONCLUSION: These data show that an LAC diet decreases the amount of circulating immune complexes in MC and can modify certain signs and symptoms of the disease. These effects of the LAC diet may be explained by postulating a functional restoration of the mononuclear phagocytic system.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four consecutive patients with ZES referred to the National Institutes of Health were studied prospectively. The extent and location of gastrinomas, acid secretory studies, and the presence or absence of MEN-I were determined and correlated with the results of the gastrin response to standard meal provocative testing. RESULTS: For patients with fasting serum gastrin levels less than 1,000 pg/mL (n = 43), only 44% had a less than 50% increase over the pre-meal value, which is reported to be the typical response in ZES, and 40% had a 50% to 99% increase. Furthermore 16% had a 100% or greater increase, 9% a 150% or greater increase, and 5% a 200% or greater increase, which overlaps with values reported to be characteristic of 98%, 92%, and 46% of patients with antral syndromes. Results did not differ for patients with or without MEN-I, depend on the extent of the gastrinoma (duodenal versus pancreatic gastrinomas), the presence of previous gastric surgery or type of gastric surgery, or for patients with fasting serum gastrin concentrations greater than or equal to 1,000 pg/mL or less than 1,000 pg/mL. studies of four patients before and after resection of the gastrinoma, who prior to surgery had a greater than 100% increase in gastrin secretion after the meal, demonstrated that all patients had a less than 100% increase postoperatively even though no gastric resection was done. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of the patients with ZES have a greater than 50% increase in serum gastrin concentration following a standard test meal and one fifth have a 100% or greater increase. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished on this basis from patients with antral syndromes. The increased serum gastrin level after the meal in these patients with ZES appears to be due to the gastrinoma. Furthermore, the current study provides no evidence for the proposals that antral syndromes are more common in patients with MEN-I, that gastric surgery affects the meal response in patients with gastrinomas, or that the meal test is useful in localizing duodenal gastrinomas.\r"

Half of those (46.7%) with positive aspirates had demonstrable cryptosporidium in stool samples, although none of the patients had diarrhea. No patient had detectable cryptosporidium in biopsy samples of the duodenum. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a surprisingly high asymptomatic carrier rate for cryptosporidium.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective clinical study of 200 consecutive patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremias to analyze in vitro susceptibility and synergistic testing of antibiotics the patients received and clinical parameters to assess their relationship to survival. RESULTS: No significant correlation between in vitro susceptibility testing (minimal inhibitory concentrations/minimal bactericidal concentrations) and outcome could be demonstrated. Similarly, improved outcome could not be demonstrated for patients receiving antibiotic combinations that were synergistic in vitro (either time-kill or checker-board) versus those combinations that were not. There was also no correlation between results obtained by time-kill curve and checkerboard synergistic testing, i.e., combinations found to be synergistic by one method were not necessarily synergistic by the other method. Clinical parameters associated with improved survival were a urinary portal of entry and absence of neutropenia. Conversely, survival was significantly decreased when the portal was the respiratory tract. The mortality rate between patients receiving combination therapy (27%) and monotherapy (47%) was significant (p less than 0.02); this significant relationship held true for most subgroups including malignancy, nosocomial infection, and infection site. CONCLUSION: Increasing effort should be placed on ensuring timely administration of combination therapy to patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia since the use of combination therapy was even more important in determining outcome than was underlying disease.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: A case-control study was performed to identify and quantify risk factors for amphotericin B-associated nephrotoxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients receiving intravenous amphotericin B for treatment of proven or suspected fungal infection who developed nephrotoxicity (greater than 100% increase in baseline serum creatinine to a level above the normal range) were compared with 60 control patients receiving amphotericin B who did not develop nephrotoxicity. Amphotericin B dosing variables and other potential risk factors were analyzed in a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Cases of nephrotoxicity received a significantly higher average daily dose of amphotericin B (0.49 +/- 0.18 mg/kg/day) than did controls (0.34 +/- 0.17 mg/kg/day). In a multivariate model, the risk of nephrotoxicity increased 3.7-fold for each 50-mg increase in total dose for a fixed duration of therapy and patient weight. Risk decreased by a factor of 0.4 for each extra day of therapy for a fixed total dose and weight. An increase in weight was also protective when the two other dosage variables were held constant. Each 0.10 mg/kg/day dose increment was associated with a 1.8-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.7) increase in the risk of nephrotoxicity. Other significant risk factors included diuretic use during amphotericin B therapy (12.5, 1.7 to 94.7), for which a linear dose-response relationship was demonstrated, and an abnormal baseline serum creatinine level (15.4, 1.4 to 173.2). CONCLUSION: Risk factors for amphotericin B-associated nephrotoxicity include higher average daily doses (approximately a doubling for each 0.10 mg/kg/day increment), diuretic use, and abnormal baseline renal function. These data suggest possible protective interventions and will aid clinicians in assessing the risk-benefit ratio of amphotericin B therapy for deep fungal infection.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The classic neuromuscular abnormalities of primary hyperparathyroidism are based on observations from an earlier time when the disease presented commonly with signs and symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to test for neuromuscular abnormalities among patients currently seen with primary hyperparathyroidism, in whom the vast majority are asymptomatic. PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: Forty-two patients (30 women, 12 men) were studied. Serum calcium level was 11.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dL (normal, 8.7 to 10.7 mg/dL); phosphorus level was 2.8 +/- 0.1 mg/dL (normal, 2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL). Parathyroid hormone levels by radioimmunoassay for N-terminal and for mid-molecule regions were 32.6 +/- 2.4 pg/mL (normal, 8 to 24 pg/mL) and 831 +/- 127 pg/mL (normal, 50 to 330 pg/mL), respectively. Although generalized weakness and easy fatigability were common complaints, they were not seen on neurologic examination. No patient showed typical neuromuscular findings such as muscle weakness or atrophy, hyperreflexia, abnormal gait, tongue fasciculations, or objective changes in mental status. On the other hand, paresthesias and muscle cramps were reported by 22 patients (52%). Neurologic examination in 12 patients (29%) demonstrated findings consisting of either stocking-glove loss of pain sensation or loss of vibratory sensation with diminished reflexes. Creatine phosphokinase levels were normal in all patients. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies were performed in nine patients. None showed myopathy or signs of motor unit denervation. Isolated nerve abnormalities (n = 6) and nonspecific sensory neuropathy (n = 2) were observed. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the classic neuromuscular syndrome of primary hyperparathyroidism is rarely seen among a typical modern-day group of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. The results suggest that the neurologic component of primary hyperparathyroidism should be included among those features of the disease that have changed along with other aspects of the clinical profile of primary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

To determine if there is a correlation between symptoms and thyroid function test results, we prospectively studied hyperthyroid patients using a standardized symptom rating scale and serum thyroid function parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 25 patients with untreated, newly diagnosed Graves' disease using the Hyperthyroid Symptom Scale (HSS) and serum levels of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) relative insulin area (RIA), and estimates of free thyroxine index (FTI). In addition, we compared thyroid hormone levels with standard measures of depression and anxiety in these patients. RESULTS: When regression analyses controlling for age were performed, none of these symptom ratings were associated with FTI or T3 RIA. The HSS was correlated with goiter size and anxiety ratings and was inversely correlated with age. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that there is no relationship between the clinical assessment of disease severity and serum levels of thyroid hormone in untreated Graves' disease.\r"

Konyne produces a brief correction of the prothrombin time and an elevation in the factor X level, but has not been effective in stopping bleeding. We report the first successful correction of prothrombin time and clinical resolution of bleeding attending the use of Autoplex T. If bleeding persists after appropriate specific factor replacement and the clinical condition warrants, the use of Autoplex T (activated prothrombin complex) deserves prompt consideration.\r"

Systolic time intervals and echocardiography were performed at set intervals with concomitant hemodynamic measurements in nine patients with chronic congestive heart failure over a 15 hour daytime period and during the three meals. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased (p less than 0.05) from a non-meal resting peak of 18 +/- 8 mm Hg at 1500 hours to 16 +/- 7 mm Hg at 2200 hours. The other non-meal cardiovascular variables, invasive and noninvasive, did not change significantly during the course of the day. Cardiac output and stroke volume rose and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances, systemic blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure generally fell significantly after meals. Although mean PEP/LVET tended to decrease and delta p/delta t increase after meals, these numerical changes were not statistically significant and none of the other noninvasive variables were affected by meals. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic congestive heart failure have modest changes in central hemodynamics over the course of a day with rather striking changes with food ingestion. These alterations are generally not reflected in noninvasive cardiovascular parameters.\r"

The effects of an asymptomatic fall in arterial pressure on plasma AVP in humans are poorly documented. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, plasma osmolality, and plasma AVP were measured in seven healthy volunteers during infusion of sodium nitroprusside on two occasions, with and without central venous pressure measurements. On both study days, heart rate increases (5 +/- 3 and 8 +/- 4 beats/min) and mean arterial pressure reductions (12 +/- 3 and 13 +/- 2.0 mm Hg) were comparable. Plasma AVP (3.2 +/- 1.4 and 4.0 +/- 1.7 pg/ml at control) did not change on either study day after nitroprusside titration (30-40 minutes) or after an additional 90 minute observation on the first day. When measured on the second day, central venous pressure declined from 5.6 +/- 1.9 to 2.9 +/- 1.5 mm Hg, p less than .001. Osmolality was constant on both days at all times. Unloading of sinoaortic baroreceptors produced by asymptomatic hypotension, coupled with a moderate reduction in central venous pressure, does not, therefore, stimulate plasma AVP secretion in normal humans. This observation has relevance to understanding the mechanisms involved in the reported increases in plasma AVP during orthostatic stress and in various diseases.\r"

Furthermore, the source of dietary fats may modify the natural history of some chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Some studies examining these issues have involved animals fed a standard chow diet to which the desired fatty acids were added. Our observation that two lots of standard rat chow varied considerably in fatty acid composition, prompted us to analyze two additional standard rat chow lots for fatty acid composition. Each lot was extracted and fatty acid chain length determined by gas chromatography with the percentage of total fatty acids determined by integration. A wide variation in the total saturated (27.4-42.1%), monounsaturated (8.3-30.9%), omega 6 (17.2-44.2%), and omega 3 (3.8-11.2%) fatty acids was observed. By one-way analysis of variance, significant differences (p less than 0.025) between the various lots were observed for total saturated, monounsaturated, and omega 6 fatty acid groups. These findings suggest that fatty acid composition of standard rat chow is not similar. If the baseline fatty acid composition is critical to the experimental design, custom chow diets should be used.\r"

Men who welded aluminum but had never smoked had more frequent wheezing, chest tightness, phlegm, feverishness and fatigue than those welding mild (black) or stainless steel. There were no significant cross-shift effects from welding exposure on measurements of pulmonary function. Although baseline expiratory flows were reduced slightly when compared to Caucasian-predicted values, ethnic specific comparisons for the largest subgroup showed only that FEF25-75 was reduced to 92.9 percentage of predicted values. Diffusing capacities for carbon monoxide were significantly reduced as compared to referents. The pulmonary function values of 25 current smokers were indistinguishable from the 41 who had never smoked, which probably reflects their low consumption of cigarettes.\r"

We compared these patients with a randomly selected group of 48 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. The mean age of the patients with glaucomalike disks (45.1 +/- 16.1 years) was significantly younger than the group with open-angle glaucoma (63.8 +/- 11.3 years). Of the patients with glaucomalike disks, 11 (23%) had a family history of glaucoma, 75% of 22 eyes with optic disk fluorescein angiograms had abnormal readings, and 59% of 43 eyes with retinal nerve fiber layer defects had abnormal readings. Photogrammetric measurements of the left disk cups were compared in 22 of the patients with glaucomalike disks to 16 matched patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. The only statistically significant difference was that the patients in the glaucoma group showed a larger cup area (surface opening) of the inferior quadrant. Our findings suggest that some glaucomalike disks may be one variant of primary open-angle glaucoma.\r"

These cases are distinctly different than the previously described \"idiopathic\" primary endotheliitis entities, which have included focal or sectoral areas of corneal edema, corneal edema in association with a migrating rejection line, or diffuse edema occurring as a dominantly inherited condition. No definitive causative agents have been established. It is likely that the disease results from an immune response to autoantigens or antigens from an unidentified viral infection. The pathogenesis may be similar to that of corneal homograft rejection.\r"

Six eyes received collagen shields every eight hours; six eyes received no treatment (control group). Epithelial healing was significantly faster (P less than .01) in corneas treated with collagen shields (47.8 +/- 1.1 microns/hr) compared to untreated control corneas (40.8 +/- 1.6 microns/hr). Regression analysis gave a projected time for closure of treated corneas of 73.96 hours, compared to 83.41 hours for untreated corneas. Scanning electron microscopy of collagen shields after eight hours of wear showed a large number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes entrapped in the collagen matrix. Light microscopy of healed corneas showed that the appearance of the regenerated epithelium in treated and untreated corneas was similar. These results demonstrate that collagen shields speed reepithelialization of keratectomy wounds in the rabbit cornea.\r"

Vitreous prolapse occurred in four patients, and three patients developed retinal detachment. Six of the 11 patients had a visual acuity of 20/40 or better after repair. The limbal wound of a pseudophakic eye can dehisce as a consequence of blunt trauma long after surgery, and the position of the intraocular lens can be disrupted. Patients undergoing cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation should be advised about the importance of long-term protective eyewear.\r"

The mother and maternal aunt of the propositus had normal visual acuity and diminished cone electroretinograms with predominant loss of red cone function. Their cone responses were greater than those of affected males. Genomic DNA isolated from these patients was analyzed with a red cone pigment gene cDNA probe that disclosed a 6.5-kilobase deletion in the red cone pigment gene. These findings substantiate that a defect in a gene encoding for a cone photoreceptor protein can lead to a cone photoreceptor degeneration.\r"

The small, delicate pieces of retina obtained by retinal biopsy are difficult to handle and prepare for histologic processing. The tissue is friable, may curl upon itself, and is often lost during normal processing. Routine methods for handling small biopsy specimens of other tissues are inadequate for preparing retinal specimens. We developed an agar-albumin tissue mount for the sterile recovery and transport of small pieces of retina from the operative field to the laboratory. The agar-albumin sandwich mount facilitates tissue processing without interfering with histologic sectioning or interpretation. The ability to recover small, friable pieces of retina in a manner that allows good histologic examination is essential if retinal biopsy specimens are to be used in the diagnosis and management of patients with infectious retinitis where the causative agent is unclear.\r"

In subjects with poorer than 20/200 uncorrected visual acuity caused by myopia, estimates of visual-evoked potential acuity could not be obtained. The correlation between these two measures of visual acuity was also lower in patients with decreased Snellen acuity attributable to retinal or ocular disease. We found that patients with unexplainable claims of decreased visual acuity could be diagnosed as having functional visual loss based on objective visual-evoked potential acuities.\r"

  ".W": "With splitting of macula by perimetry, the entopic phenomena (the perception of one's own foveal xanthophilic pigment and macular vessel leukocytes) were utilized to study the character of macular sparing or splitting in patients with pregeniculate or postgeniculate hemianopsia. In the pregeniculate group, 11 of 14 eyes perceived the Haidinger brushes figure as a half circle corresponding to the perimetric macular splitting, whereas flying corpuscles were not perceived at all or were less numerous on the hemianoptic side than on the normal field side. In contrast, six of seven patients with postgeniculate lesions perceived the Haidinger brushes figure as a complete circle, four of six perceived fewer flying corpuscles on the hemianoptic side than on the normal field side, and two patients reported perceiving an equal number in all quadrants. This study indicated that in pregeniculate hemianopsia there is usually a true splitting of the macula, whereas in postgeniculate hemianopsia, there is some macular sparing even when perimetry shows macular splitting.\r"

  ".W": "Characteristics of pressure overload hypertrophy are known to include an accumulation of collagen (or fibrosis) and a biochemical remodeling of fibrillar type I and III collagens. The corresponding structural nature of myocardial fibrosis is less clear. This light morphologic study was undertaken to address this issue in the hypertrophied left ventricle of the nonhuman primate with experimental hypertension. For this purpose, the picrosirius red technique and polarization microscopy were used to examine the myocardium during the evolutionary, early, and late phases of established hypertrophy corresponding to 4, 35, and 88 weeks of experimental hypertension. Evidence of increased thin perimysial fiber formation, together with collagen fiber disruption and edema at 4 weeks of hypertrophy, was found when the chamber volume to left ventricular mass ratio was reduced. After 35 weeks, when this ratio was again normal, a greater number of intermuscular spaces contained both thick and thin perimysial fibers. In addition to this interstitial fibrosis, a reactive fibrosis consisting of a meshwork of thick and thin perimysial fibers was seen extending over muscle fibers. Finally, at 88 weeks, this fibrous meshwork had encircled muscle and there now was evidence of cell necrosis. The accompanying replacement fibrosis consisted of yet another distinctive orthogonal grid of thick and thin collagen fibers. Thus, a continuum of fibrillar collagen remodeling was seen in pressure overload hypertrophy in the nonhuman primate myocardium. Structurally distinct patterns of myocardial fibrosis were recognized based on the alignment of perimysial fibers with muscle that may explain the cellular remodeling and altered mechanical behavior of the concentrically hypertrophied myocardium.\r"

A high degree of correlation was shown. For each case the DNA ploidy was determined by quantitation of the DNA Feulgen stain by computerized microdensitometry. DNA content of breast tumor cells correlated to the histopathologic grade at which poorly differentiated tumors are more likely to be aneuploid. Quantitation of immunohistochemistry for estrogen and progesterone receptors had a high degree of correlation with the steroid binding assay, such as dextran-coated charcoal assay (DCCA), and were weakly correlated to histologic grade. In summary, our results indicated that quantitation of Ki-67-positive nuclear area and of DNA content by image analysis provides an objective method for assessing tumor cell growth fraction and DNA ploidy. Quantitation of steroid receptors by immunohistochemistry is a better and easier technique than those currently used to determine the best therapy for postmenopausal women. These methods can be performed on small frozen sections or needle aspirates in quantities that are insufficient for current steroid binding assays. Thus, this method is prognosticly useful even for patients with small breast lesions.\r"

  ".U": "90053802\r", 
  ".W": "Approximately one third of the female mice of the LTXBO strain develop spontaneous ovarian teratomas. These tumors contain a large neuroepithelial component, which includes primitive neural structures resembling embryonic neural tubes (medulloepithelial rosettes), ependymoblastic and ependymal rosettes, neuroblasts, mature ganglionic neurons, myelinated neurites, and astrocytes. The purpose of this study was to characterize these tumors according to the immunohistochemical location of some well-characterized trophic and regulatory neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, several neuronal-associated cytoskeletal proteins, and other proteins indicative of neuronal and glial differentiation. Medulloepithelial rosettes showed focal serotonin-like, opioid peptide-like and gamma-amino butyric acid-like immunoreactivity, and displayed immunostaining for the neuron-associated class III beta-tubulin isotype. The mature ganglion cells were also immunoreactive for these markers, and, in addition, for somatostatin, cholecystokinin, bombesin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and neuropeptide Y. Mature ganglion cells were also immunoreactive for proteins associated with the neuronal cytoskeleton (including microtubule-associated proteins, MAP2 and tau, and higher molecular weight phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated neurofilament subunits), neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin. Undifferentiated stem cells, ependymoblastic and ependymal rosettes, and astroglia all stained with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes all mammalian beta-tubulin isotypes, but did not react with antibodies to neuronal-associated cytoskeletal proteins or neuropeptides. Neuropeptide-like immunoreactivity and demonstration of the class III beta-tubulin isotype indicate early neuronal commitment in neoplastic primitive neuroepithelium. These patterns of immunoreactivity closely follow those encountered in the normal neurocytogenesis of the mammalian and avian forebrain, and increase the precision with which the early stages of progressive neuroepithelial differentiation can be analyzed in human embryonal tumors of the CNS.\r"

  ".W": "The serine protease inhibitor alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) has been shown to be tightly associated with the amyloid found in plaque cores and blood vessels in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the ACT found in plaques could be derived from the high levels of ACT in serum, previous Northern analysis revealed that ACT mRNA is produced locally in AD gray matter at much higher levels than in control gray matter. To determine which brain cells express ACT mRNA, we conducted in situ hybridization with 35S-labeled cRNA probes on hippocampal sections from four AD and three control cases. To identify astrocytes unequivocally, some of the hybridized sections were immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein, which is astrocyte-specific. Our results showed numerous astrocytes that were intensely labeled by the probe for ACT mRNA throughout the subicular gray matter of the AD cases. In contrast, astrocytes in control gray matter were rarely labeled by the probe for ACT mRNA. Examination of plaque cores in the AD subiculum showed that some astrocytes intensely labeled by the probe for ACT mRNA were closely associated with virtually every plaque core. Our results also showed many astrocytes in both AD and control white matter that were intensely labeled by the probe for ACT mRNA, and a small fraction of the astrocytes in a juvenile cerebellar astrocytoma that we examined were found to produce high levels of ACT mRNA. In every area in which astrocytes expressing ACT mRNA were found, astrocytes producing no detectable ACT message were also present. Our findings indicate that astrocytes produce the increased ACT mRNA in AD gray matter observed by Northern analysis, but they also show that ACT mRNA expression by astrocytes is not unique to AD. The presence of astrocytes expressing ACT mRNA near, and extending processes towards, plaque cores strongly suggests that some if not all of the ACT associated with amyloid plaque cores is produced by astrocytes surrounding the cores.\r"

Implantation of an endotoxin-soaked cotton thread in the adventitia on the ventral side of the rat femoral artery resulted in leukocyte migration into the vessel wall exclusively in the ventral half of the vessel. Leukocyte migration occurred from both the luminal and adventitial side and consisted of neutrophils and mononuclear cells. Smooth muscle cell rich intimal lesions localized to the ventral half of the vessel were first observed 1 week after implantation. Lesions remained localized to the ventral half of the vessel wall through the 6th week. When leukocyte migration into the vessel wall was inhibited by treatment with dexamethasone, lesion development did not occur. These results suggest that leukocytes can stimulate smooth muscle cell migration into the intima and result in intimal lesion formation.\r"

  ".W": "Whether or not the previously reported O3-induced abnormality in the postnatal development of tracheal secretory function in lambs is accompanied by changes in epithelial cell populations and their glycoconjugate composition was determined. Six lambs were killed at birth and 12 lambs at age 2 weeks. Of the latter 12, six were exposed to O3 (1 ppm, 4 hours daily for 5 days during the 1st week of life) and five had air-sham exposures (controls). Tracheal glycoconjugates were localized in situ with lectins to detect N-acetyl-galactosamine (galNAc), alpha-D-galactose (alpha-gal), beta-D-gal(1----3)-galNAc (beta-gal), and fucose (fuc). Mean (+/- SD) epithelial cell density (cells/mm basal lamina) was 418 +/- 57 in the newborns, 385 +/- 63 in controls (P was not significant), and 342 +/- 47 in O3-exposed lambs (P less than 0.05). Mucous cell density was 87 +/- 12 in newborns, 63 +/- 10 in controls (P less than 0.05), and 76 +/- 10 in O3 exposed lambs (P was not significant). Ciliated cells remained unchanged from birth to 2 weeks (P was not significant), but decreased (P less than 0.05) in O3-exposed lambs. All counted mucous cells contained fuc and galNAc at birth and retained these residues after sham and O3 exposure. The alpha-gal-containing mucous cells declined from 97 +/- 13 to 7 +/- 1 (P less than 0.05) and beta-gal containing cells from 39 +/- 5 to 25 +/- 4 in controls. In contrast, cells containing alpha-gal 71 +/- 10 remained at newborn levels (97 +/- 13) and beta-gal-containing cells increased from 40 +/- 5 at birth to 58 +/- 8 in O3-exposed animals (P less than 0.05). It was concluded that early postnatal exposure of lambs to O3 causes a decrease in epithelial cell density, but retards the developmental decrease in the number of tracheal mucous cells and alters the lectin detectable carbohydrate composition of mucus in these cells. These developmental defects were interpreted to be the morphologic correlates of the previously shown effects of O3 on the maturation of secretory function and mucus transport.\r"

The normal DA is characterized by the development of intimal thickening, a process that does not occur in the persistent DA. Distribution of PGI2 synthase was identical in the aorta, pulmonary artery, and persistent DA. In these vessels endothelial cells contained higher levels of PGI2 synthase as compared with medial smooth muscle cells. In the normal DA, levels of PGI2 synthase were clearly higher in smooth muscle cells at the sites of intimal thickening than at other sites. Distribution of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha resembled the localization of PGI2 synthase. Presence of PGE2 and activity of PGDH could not be demonstrated. The results demonstrated existence of a clear relationship between ductal morphology and the presence of PGI2 synthase. This finding suggests a more important role for PGI2 in regulating ductal patency than has heretofore been appreciated. It was assumed that the role of PGI2 in regulating ductal patency is, at birth, at least overruled by the constrictive effect of the cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase mechanism. It is still possible to attribute a role to PGI2 in the regulation of cushion formation. Once smooth muscle cell activity has been enhanced by the presence of a glycosaminoglycan rich environment, increase in PGI2 may produce a concurrent inhibition of smooth muscle cell growth.\r"

Selective depletion of T lymphocyte subpopulations indicated that CD4 cells were either completely or partially responsible for cell damage in both organs. Other organs such as the liver were infected and contained virus titers equivalent to those seen in the heart and pancreas but showed no apparent tissue injury. The role of the CD4 cell was confirmed by positive selection of either T cell subpopulation from CVB3-immune lymphocytes in vitro and adoptive transfer of these cells into T cell-deficient (thymectomized, irradiated, bone marrow reconstituted, TXBM) DBA/2 recipients. Lymphocytes from CVB3-infected donor mice were adsorbed to myocyte, skin fibroblast, or liver vascular endothelial cell (VEC) monolayers. The adherent population was retrieved and adoptively transferred into uninfected syngeneic recipients. When killed 7 days later, the animals receiving unfractionated immune lymphocytes or cells eluted from heart monolayers developed both myocarditis and pancreatitis. Anti-Thy 1.2 and C' treatment of the unfractionated cells completely abrogated transfer of disease. Cells eluted from either fibroblast or liver VEC monolayers showed no pathogenicity. Adsorption of immune cells to heart monolayers in the presence of anti-IAd (class II major histocompatibility complex antigen, MHC) inhibited attachment of the pathogenic T cell, whereas anti KdDd (a class I MHC antigen) had no effect.\r"

  ".W": "Despite major advances in the differential diagnosis of mesotheliomas versus adenocarcinomas, a certain percentage defy diagnosis. Several markers such as keratin, carcinoembryonic antigen, Leu-M1, milk fat globulin, and antibody against tumor-associated glycoprotein Tag-72 (B72.3) have been used to distinguish them. In this study, blood group antigens, namely Lewisx and Lewisy, known to be expressed in a number of adenocarcinomas of diverse origin were used in the differential diagnosis of 30 samples from 18 mesotheliomas and 18 primary lung adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas showed strong diffuse homogeneous staining, membranous staining, or both for Lewisy in 100% of cases irrespective of differentiation. Lewisx was expressed in 78% of adenocarcinomas with a wide variation in distribution of staining. Mesotheliomas did not show the diffuse homogeneous staining pattern but showed a markedly distinctive granular staining in the cytoplasm of rare cells in 23% of Lewisy and 20% of Lewisx cases, which was interpreted as negative. In conclusion, Lewisy is a sensitive marker for adenocarcinomas in that it stains 100% of cases and is a specific marker in the differential diagnosis of mesotheliomas and adenocarcinomas.\r"

  ".U": "90053816\r", 
  ".W": "In postsurgical staging of colorectal adenocarcinomas, it is sometimes difficult to determine the range of possible venous spread. Distinguishing between the extramural veins (especially when the neoplastic embolus takes up the whole lumen and the endothelium cannot be identified) and the smallest extramural lymph nodes (when they are completely replaced by metastatic carcinoma, leaving the capsule alone) is also difficult. This work proposes a more precise definition of true venous invasion to improve histopathologic staging. Immunohistochemical techniques employing commercial antibodies against Factor VIII RAG, with and without enzymatic digestion, and UEA I lectin for residual endothelium detection, were applied, as well as antibodies against vimentin, desmin, and alpha sm-1 actin to detect wall components. The immunohistochemical evaluation of colorectal adenocarcinomas, in particular by anti-alpha sm-1 actin antibodies, permitted a reliable morphologic distinction of the true venous invasion. This factor proved to be relevant for survival rate prediction.\r"

The present study compared diurnal MHPG rhythms in the plasma of 18 male depressed patients and 12 healthy male volunteers. A diurnal rhythm of MHPG closely fit to a cosine model was observed in volunteers and, to a lesser extent, in depressed patients. Patients, especially those with endogenous depression (N = 11), demonstrated an earlier acrophase (mean +/- SD = 12.53 +/- 3.38 hours), and treatment with desipramine was associated with a significant (3-hour) phase delay. This study confirms and extends previous reports of apparent phase advances in circadian noradrenergic rhythms in depressed patients.\r"

The PTSD subjects without alexithymia did not differ on the finger localization task from 10 male control subjects without alexithymia. These data suggest that at least some forms of alexithymia may be mediated by an interhemispheric communication deficit.\r"

Each of these percentages was significantly higher than that for persons with no lifetime psychiatric disorder (53.4%). Both lifetime affective and anxiety disorders were uniquely associated with a greater prevalence of any lifetime chronic medical condition, but the only psychiatric disorders uniquely associated with current (i.e., active) chronic medical conditions were anxiety disorders, suggesting that the association between anxiety disorders and chronic medical conditions develops more quickly than associations between medical conditions and other psychiatric disorders.\r"

Nonfamily social resources were positively associated with good prognosis for both psychotic groups.

A prolonged desire to be dead was a more specific risk factor for a suicide attempt than was a thought of suicide.

Alcoholics with panic attacks were similar to nonalcoholic patients with panic disorder in their response to lactate. These findings support the specificity of lactate-induced panic for panic states and suggest that panic attacks in alcoholics resemble those in nonalcoholics.

Perceived stress, related both to family life and the workplace, was associated with a high level of depressive symptoms. \"Long-distance marriage\" (\"business bachelorhood\"), peculiar to Japanese occupations, had little influence on depressive symptomatology.\r"

Between 1970 and 1984, the total Person-Years of Life Lost (PYLL), the sum of the difference between the actual age at death and the expected remaining lifetime for each person who died of cancer, increased for most cancer sites as well as for all sites combined. In 1984, 6,881,281 person-years of life were lost due to cancer deaths, up from 5,303,668 in 1970. The exceptions are those cancers for which there has been major progress in either prevention or treatment; e.g., stomach and cervix uteri (prevention) and testicular, Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, and childhood cancers (treatment). The Average Years of Life Lost (AYLL) per person dying from cancer in 1984 was generally less than in 1970. Overall, each person who died from cancer in 1984 died 15.2 years earlier than his/her life expectancy. The greatest loss was for those who died of childhood cancers (66.9 years earlier), followed by testicular cancer (35.8 years earlier). The least loss relative to the expectation of life was for those who died of prostate cancer. The 25,400 men who died from prostate cancer in 1984 died an average of nine years earlier than otherwise expected.\r"

The influence on participation of known breast cancer risk factors, as well as a summary risk label, (i.e. \"high\", or \"moderate\") were examined. The overall participation rate was 71 percent among 2,422 women, 50 to 79 years of age, invited to a centralized clinic. Multivariate analyses showed participation to be somewhat decreased among women with late menopause and definitely increased among women with any of the following factors: 1) increased age; 2) a family history of breast cancer; and 3) a previous breast biopsy. Women in the high-risk group were most likely to participate but the effect of the label was stronger among women ages 50 to 59 compared to women ages 60 to 79. The study results are generally consistent with previous findings that participants in screening programs have higher rates of breast cancer. The results also suggest the possibility that providing breast cancer risk information may encourage participation in screening.\r"

Of those who had ever had a mammogram, 21% reported that the mammogram in the past year was their first one. Of those women who are over 50 and had ever had a mammogram, 57% reported one in the past year. Analyses demonstrated that a combination of demographic factors, certain beliefs and knowledge, having a regular physician, social interaction and media exposure are independently related to ever having a mammogram, and to having one in the past year. Despite anecdotal and empirical evidence that the proportion of women ever having had a mammogram has substantially increased in the past several years, increasing utilization among older and lower-income women provides a challenge for public health.\r"

While previous studies have investigated risk of breast cancer in birth cohorts by examining partial aspects of cohort childbearing, the present ecological study assesses total cohort childbearing risk in Connecticut women born between 1855 and 1945. In each cohort, the proportion of women nulliparous and first bearing children in their twenties, thirties, and forties are weighted by relative risks associated with these events as ascertained in previous studies. Summed cohort childbearing risks are compared to the incidence of breast cancer in women 40 years of age and older in the same cohorts. Changes in decade of first birth and nulliparity do not explain the changes in breast cancer incidence observed: while cohort childbearing risk has declined over the period examined, breast cancer incidence has increased in the same cohorts. Alternative explanations for cohort increases in breast cancer incidence are reviewed.\r"

From 1982 to 1985, the percentage of women with cancer confined to the breast increased from 54.0 percent to 61.3 percent. During 1984 and 1985, lower socioeconomic status (SES) women with breast cancer were less likely than higher SES women to be diagnosed with early-stage disease (56.9 percent vs 62.7 percent). SES was estimated by census tract of residence. In the same years, the overall incidence of breast cancer was greater in higher SES women. Projections based on these incidence data found that lower SES women, as compared to higher SES women, had a higher rate of expected breast cancer deaths (24.6 vs 19.7 per 100,000), and a greater percentage of those deaths considered preventable by early detection (22 percent vs 11 percent). The rate of preventable deaths in lower SES women was 2.5 times as great as that for higher SES women (5.3 vs 2.1 per 100,000). Tumor registries can serve as useful surveillance systems to aid cancer control programs. Breast cancer early-detection programs should give special attention to lower SES women.\r"

The present paper examines the feasibility of using this disease in active cancer surveillance in New York State. After consulting cancer case reports, hospital records, death certificates, and city directories, we obtained occupational data for 17 of 22 cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer of the scrotum diagnosed between 1979 and 1984. Only three cases had occupations previously linked to scrotal cancer, while 11 of 19 cases had one or more possibly contributory medical conditions. The probable under-reporting of scrotal cancer cases and incompleteness of occupational data may limit the usefulness of scrotal cancer as a sentinel health event (occupational) unless additional steps are taken.\r"

We interviewed 384 cases (or spouses, for deceased cases), and compared their responses with those of 876 controls. We classed distilled liquors as dark or light, a rough division according to content of potentially carcinogenic compounds in the beverages. The relative effect on hypopharyngeal cancer risk was much stronger for those who reported high consumption of dark liquor (relative risk = 4.4, 90% confidence interval = 2.9, 6.8) than for those reporting comparable consumption of light liquor (relative risk = 1.3, 90% CI = 0.8, 2.1). For laryngeal cancer, consumption of dark liquor had a smaller effect, and there was little distinction between the effects of dark and light liquor. The data appear consistent with the theory that the non-alcoholic content of distilled alcoholic beverages is a determinant of cancer risk, and that alcoholic beverages act topically rather than systemically in their carcinogenic action.\r"

Between September 1980 and June 1982, we implemented five injury prevention projects concurrently in nine Massachusetts cities and town; five sites, matched on selected demographic characteristics, were control communities. An estimated 42 percent of households with children ages 0-5 years were exposed to one or more of the interventions over the two-year period in the nine communities. Participation in safety programs increased three-fold in the intervention communities and two-fold in the control communities. Safety knowledge and practices increased in both intervention and control communities. Households that reported participatory exposure to the interventions had higher safety knowledge and behavior scores than those that received other community exposure or no exposure to intervention activities. We found a distinct reduction in motor vehicle occupant injuries among children ages 0-5 years in the intervention compared with control communities, associated with participatory exposure of about 55 percent of households with children ages 0-5 years. We have no evidence that the coordinated intervention programs reduced the other target injuries--although exposure to prevention messages was associated with safety behaviors for burns and poisonings.\r"

Cryptosporidiosis was confirmed by zinc sulfate flotation of fecal specimens in four persons, three of whom had been responsible for the care and treatment of infected calves. A fourth patient had washed her husband's soiled clothing and appeared to have been infected indirectly through fomite contamination. Among 112 persons surveyed, 26 (23.2 percent) had a diarrheal illness during the outbreak and nine met the case definition of a diarrheal illness lasting at least three days. These persons were more likely to have had contact with a calf with diarrhea than were 52 referents who did not become ill during the outbreak.\r"

We constructed a microcomputer-based data base of all singleton births in Massachusetts, 1975-84. The original data were stored in 700,000 records, each 174 bytes long, occupying a total of over 120 megabytes (MB). By removing redundant information and unique identifiers, and packing the data, we store 21 fields of this information in a 16-byte record resulting in a data base of 11.1 MB, a saving of over 90 percent of disk space. By using programs written expressly for this data base, we can display a birth weight frequency plot of the entire data set in under 65 seconds on an IBM-compatible PC-AT. Comparable assessments in SAS-PC took over 105 minutes and in main frame SAS on an AS-9000 took over 37 CPU seconds. Implementing similar systems for state registries on births, deaths, cancers, and birth defects potentially offers investigators easy access to vast stores of information and would enable public health officials to produce timely reports, initiate a variety of surveillance activities, and respond rapidly to residents' inquiries about clusters and anomalous disease patterns.\r"

  ".W": "Due to public concern regarding the potential adverse health effects of exposure to Santa Monica Bay waters, a case-control study of acute illnesses among Los Angeles County lifeguards was conducted. Workers' compensation claimants (N = 112) were matched to healthy lifeguards working in the same year and having the same job classification. Conditional logistic regression showed that the southernmost worksites of the bay were associated with all acute illnesses (OR = 14.4, 95% CI = 4.7, 44.8) and with ear infections (OR = 12.5, 95% CI = 2.9, 53.4).\r"

  ".W": "In Los Angeles County from 1983-1988, rates of amebiasis declined 65 percent among White males 15-44 years. No such decline occurred among White females 15-44 years or White males less than 15. Reported acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases in the district of highest AIDS incidence has followed the initial decline in amebiasis by four years. Amebiasis trends may be a useful predictor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission and future rates of AIDS among gay men.\r"
