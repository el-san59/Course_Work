Rat heart endothelial cells were isolated by enzymatic disaggregation. Endothelial, glomerular mesangial, glomerular epithelial and tubular cells were cultured in Minimum essential medium until they reached confluency (5 to 9 days). These different rat parenchymal cell types were characterized by morphology and antibody stainings. Endothelial cells were characterized by factor VIII positivity and mesangial cells were desmin positive. Both glomerular epithelial and tubular cells expressed the brush border and Tamm-Horsfall antigens, but in vivo injected trypan blue accumulated selectively to proximal tubular cells. Class I expression was high (84 to 95% of about 10(5) cells grown in Lab-Tek culture chambers were reactive with anti-class I antibody) in unstimulated endothelial, glomerular epithelial and tubular cells and was even higher (100%) after incubation with gamma-interferon for three days. Mesangial cells expressed class I considerably less in normal state (34%), but gamma-interferon induction upregulated it to 95%. Both the surface and intracytoplasmic expression of class I antigens were upregulated with three-day gamma-interferon treatment. Class II expression was low in all unstimulated cells (5 to 10%). The three-day gamma-interferon treatment upregulated both surface as well as cytoplasmic expression of class II antigens in all cell types.\r"

A paired restricted sequential trial designed to detect a reduction in mortality from 80 to 40% in culture-positive patients surviving greater than 48 hours was stopped after 22 months. Of the 161 patients entered into the study, 65 had bacteriologically confirmed melioidosis and 54 of these were septicaemic. Ceftazidime treatment was associated with a 50% (95% CI 19-81%) lower overall mortality than conventional treatment (74% vs 37%; p = 0.009) and should now become the treatment of choice for severe melioidosis.\r"

In-vitro experiments showed complete binding of oxalate to OMH. In clinical studies in nineteen patients with intestinal disorders and stone formation, urinary oxalate excretion was significantly lower during OMH treatment than off treatment. The activity product index of calcium oxalate was reduced on treatment. A pronounced rise in the inhibitory activity of urine was seen in two patients with very low pretreatment values. Most patients experienced virtual normalisation of bowel function, and in those with severe stone formation there was substantial clinical improvement. It is concluded that OMH has the capacity to bind oxalate in vitro and to reduce urinary oxalate excretion. These observations suggest a new promising treatment for enteric hyperoxaluria.\r"

In addition, morphine was given to provide analgesia. The mean duration of infusion was 20.2 h (range 3.0-24.5) in the propofol group and 21.3 h (4.0-47.0) in the midazolam group and infusion rates were 1.77 mg/kg/h (range 0.40-5.00) and 0.10 mg/kg/h (0.01-0.26), respectively. The infusion rates were adjusted as necessary, and the desired level of sedation was achieved easily in most patients in both groups. There were slight falls in arterial pressure, but there were no significant differences between the groups. Heart rate was lower in patients who received propofol. Some small changes occurred in biochemical and haematological variables in both groups, but they were not clinically significant. There was no indication that either drug substantially impaired adrenal steroidogenesis. When the infusion was discontinued, there was less variability in recovery of consciousness in patients who had received propofol. In a subgroup of patients, weaning from mechanical ventilation was achieved significantly faster after discontinuation of propofol than of midazolam. Propofol proved to be a satisfactory agent for sedation of these critically ill patients and compared favourably with midazolam.\r"

Patients completed the Moos menstrual distress questionnaire (MDQ) and the premenstrual distress questionnaire (PDQ) daily throughout the study. 5 patients withdrew, 4 because of skin reactions and 1 because of considerable improvement with initial (active) treatment. After 3 months, both groups showed improvement in MDQ and PDQ scores. In general, between 3 and 6 months, patients who switched from active treatment to placebo had deteriorating scores while patients who switched from placebo to active treatment maintained or improved upon their initial gains. Significant improvements occurred after changing to active treatment in five of six negative MDQ symptom clusters and in six of ten PDQ symptoms.\r"

The advice on fat was not associated with any difference in mortality, perhaps because it produced only a small reduction (3-4%) in serum cholesterol. The subjects advised to eat fatty fish had a 29% reduction in 2 year all-cause mortality compared with those not so advised. This effect, which was significant, was not altered by adjusting for ten potential confounding factors. Subjects given fibre advice had a slightly higher mortality than other subjects (not significant). The 2 year incidence of reinfarction plus death from ischaemic heart disease was not significantly affected by any of the dietary regimens. A modest intake of fatty fish (two or three portions per week) may reduce mortality in men who have recovered from MI.\r"

Pre-embryo culture medium was supplemented with 0 (control), 0.186, 0.93, or 1.49 mumol/1 PAF. Pre-embryos were transferred to PAF-containing medium 15-17 h after insemination (ie, just before syngamy) for 24 h and then transferred to the uterus. For 185 women receiving control pre-embryos, the pregnancy rate (positive beta human chorionic gonadotropin per oocyte retrieval) was 10.2%, while 166 women who received PAF treated pre-embryos (all concentrations combined) achieved a pregnancy rate of 17.5%. This difference was significant. The pregnancy rates per pre-embryo transferred were 6.1% and 9.4% for the control and PAF groups, respectively. The percentage of positive pregnancy tests that resulted in a viable pregnancy (presence of fetal heart at 8 weeks) was 78.9% in the controls and 75.9% in the PAF group. There was no difference in the average number of embryos transferred in either group. The increase in the pregnancy rate after a short exposure of pre-embryos to PAF in vitro suggests that PAF mediates pre-embryo development.\r"

Because of the highly specialized and technical nature of medical informatics, the dissemination of early articles on the subject was largely dependent on publication of the proceedings and transactions of meetings of professional organizations. The American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) was recently formed from the merger of three professional organizations, each dedicated to medical informatics: the American Association for Medical systems and Informatics (AAMSI), the American College for Medical Informatics (ACMI), and the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (SCAMC). An increase in professional interest and activity in medical informatics is anticipated in the 1990s.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disorder the primary therapeutic principles of which have long been based on the combination of physical activity with appropriate diet. Although exercise in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) may be associated with metabolic deterioration in the case of lack of adequate provision of insulin and carbohydrate in balanced amounts, the beneficial effects of exercise in diabetes are numerous. Exercise facilitates the utilization of glucose as the main source of energy for contracting muscles and decreases peripheral insulin resistance. Limited epidemiological studies have demonstrated that lack of physical activity may be involved in the epidemic outburst of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in some unusual populations. Long-term studies are still needed to show that lifelong physical training and exercise reduce morbidity and mortality in diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Fuel homeostasis and blood glucose levels are remarkably well maintained during exercise in healthy individuals. However, in insulin-dependent diabetics, the very basis for fuel homeostasis adjustments, i.e., a normal endogenous insulin production, is absent. The metabolic alterations characterizing diabetes may, therefore, under certain circumstances lead to pertubations of fuel homeostasis. Thus, exercise in the hyperinsulinemic patients may result in hypoglycemic reactions and, in hypoinsulinemic patients, in increased blood glucose levels. In addition, diabetes mellitus is associated with peripheral insulin resistance, which may result in a deterioration of the overall glucose homeostasis and consequently make the treatment more difficult to manage. Regular physical activity has been shown to normalize the peripheral insulin resistance in insulin-dependent diabetics. Knowledge about these responses is important in order to enable this patient group to participate in physical activities on the same conditions as non-diabetics. However, advice on how insulin-dependent diabetics should adjust insulin or diet before exercise is difficult to give due to high interindividual variability in response to exercise. Thus, individualized recommendations for exact treatment modification in association with exercise are necessary.\r"

  ".W": "The evidence that exercise reduces resistant to the action of insulin has generated interest in the possibility that endurance exercise training may be a worthwhile primary therapeutic intervention in the treatment of mild non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Unfortunately, the results of several studies of exercise training in NIDDM have been discouraging since improvements in oral glucose tolerance (OGT) did not occur or were quite modest even though insulin resistance was reduced. Recently it was determined that 12 months of endurance exercise training at 75-90% of VO2max could normalize OGT in men with mild NIDDM when the post-training OGTT was performed within 18 h of the last bout of exercise. This, coupled with the fact that the enhanced action of insulin is lost in trained persons within a few days of cessation of training, suggests that improved glucose tolerance in NIDDM patients may be partly due to the persistent effects of the last bouts of exercise. Acute exercise in the form of 7 d of intense walking/cycling has been shown to improve glucose tolerance despite a significantly smaller increase in plasma insulin levels during the OGTT in NIDDM. Apparently, the improvement in OGT was due to a decrease in resistance to insulin over the short term since no changes in body weight, body fat, or VO2max took place. Thus, acute exercise of sufficient intensity and duration can increase peripheral insulin action and may contribute to the effects of long-term exercise training on improvement in OGT and the amelioration of insulin resistance in patients with NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that catecholamine release is associated with stressful events and that adrenaline administration induces hyperfibrinolysis. To examine the possible involvement of the adrenoreceptor mechanism in the regulation of fibrinolytic activity at rest and to maximum exercise, 12 healthy volunteers (six males and six females, age range 19-21 yr) were orally medicated with two formulations of a beta blocker. The drug treatments consisted of 1) a single dose of OM756 alpha 10 mg propranolol \"Inderal\" tablet, 2) a single dose of a generic 10 mg propranolol tablet, and 3) a single dose of generic placebo. The drug administrations were assigned to the subjects using a complete Latin square design and double-blind procedure and were separated by 7 d. Two hours after the administration of the respective drug treatment, subjects exercised to maximal capacity using a graded exercise protocol on a bicycle ergometer. Prior to and 2 h after the drug administration and immediately after maximum exercise, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen consumption were measured and venous blood was removed and analyzed for fibrinolytic activity using a standard fibrin plate method. ANOVA showed that the resting and maximum heart rates were significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) following oral premedication with either of the two formulations of beta blocker, while blood pressure and oxygen consumption were unaffected. ANOVA also showed no difference in the resting fibrinolytic activity 2 h post-administration of the drug treatments but a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in the normal fibrinolytic response to maximum exercise. It was concluded, therefore, that the resting level of fibrinolytic activity is not mediated via an adrenergic pathway but that the enhanced fibrinolytic activity to maximum exercise is partially regulated via an adrenoreceptor mechanism.\r"

Twelve men and nine women from the Norwegian national cross country skiing team and 19 men and six women from a level just below that of the national team were studied before and after ski race competition. Mononuclear cells were isolated after incubation of heparinized blood with lipopolysaccharides (LPS; 3 ng.ml-1) for 2 h. After a 50 km race for men, the specific thromboplastin activity of the stimulated monocytes rose from 3.5 x 10(-3)/10(6) cells to 21.4 x 10(-3)/10(6) cells. This probably reflects the mobilization of a new population of monocytes that are more sensitive to such stimuli. Resting top-athlete skiers had monocytes which were significantly less responsive to the LPS stimulus compared to nontrained people. There was an inverse correlation of plasma factor VII and the monocyte responsiveness to in vitro stimulation (r = 0.814; P less than 0.002) from blood drawn after a race. Furthermore, factor VII was significantly reduced after a 50 km race, and a modest decline in the fibrinogen level was also observed (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that endurance ski racing causes white cell mobilization and more active white cells that may induce activation of the coagulation system and account for the involvement of factor VII and fibrinogen.\r"

Although the two subpopulations demonstrated modest differences in sport activity at the time of injury, specific diagnoses, and anatomic location of injury, many similarities existed between the groups. Running, fitness classes, and field sports were more commonly associated with injury in the younger group, while racquet sports, walking, and low intensity sports were more commonly associated with injury in the older group. The frequency of tendinitis was similar in both age groups, while metatarsalgia, plantar fasciitis, and meniscal injury were more common in the older population, and patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) and stress fracture/periostitis were more common in the younger population. Anatomically, injury sites in the foot were more frequent in the older group, while injury sites in the knee were more frequent in the younger group. In the older population, the prevalence of osteoarthritis was 2.5 times higher than the frequency of osteoarthritis as the source of activity-related pain. In the older group, 85% of the diagnoses were overuse injuries known to respond to conservative treatment, 14.4% of the cases required consultative referral, and only 4.1% required surgery.\r"

There were no significant differences in T-cell subsets among steroid users and non-users, but lymphocyte transformation studies revealed that the anabolic-androgenic steroid-using group had enhanced proliferative ability to the B-cell mitogen, SAC, in comparison to non-bodybuilding controls. NK activity was significantly (P less than 0.05) augmented in the anabolic-androgenic steroid users but not in the non-using bodybuilders. Serum immunoglobulin levels, in particular IgA, were significantly (P less than 0.017) lower in the steroid-using group. Four of 13 steroid users and three of eight non-steroid-using bodybuilders had detectable antinuclear antibodies. These studies indicate that 1) anabolic-androgenic steroid use as practiced by contemporary athletes is a potent modulator of immune responsiveness and 2) autoantibodies are prevalent in strength-trained men even in the absence of anabolic steroid use.\r"

  ".U": "89384081\r", 
  ".W": "In both types of striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac), calcium flux across the plasma membrane (sarcolemma) is regulated by at least three distinct membrane proteins; a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel, Ca2+ pump (Ca2+ ATPase), and the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter. Each of these proteins is subject to regulation by intracellular second messengers. The magnitude and the role of this transsarcolemmal calcium flux are quite different between cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiac muscle, the influx is large, precedes, and is obligatory for contraction. There is general agreement that this influx is the trigger for Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the heart according to the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release hypothesis. Variations in the transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx have a profound effect on the strength of cardiac contraction, and it appears that this is the primary physiological strategy for regulation of contractility. In skeletal muscle, on the other hand, the T-tubules represent the richest source of dihydropyridine (DHP)-sensitive calcium channels known to exist, yet the influx of Ca2+ is proportionally much smaller and a significant portion enters the fiber following the twitch. While the majority of the Ca2+ influx is twitch dependent, it is quite clear that contraction in skeletal muscle is not predicated on this influx. It has been proposed that these DHP channels act as voltage sensors in order to initiate release of SR Ca2+; however, the link between the sensors and the opening of the SR Ca2+ (ryanodine-sensitive) channel is unknown. Transsarcolemmal Ca2+ transport appears to be subject to intense regulation to modify the acute response and demonstrates some plasticity in the adaptation to chronic perturbations.\r"

  ".U": "89384082\r", 
  ".W": "In muscle, energy supply is finely tuned to energy demand. Ca2+-activated ATP hydrolysis in the cytosol provides ADP to the mitochondrion to stimulate oxidative phosphorylation by acceptor control of mitochondrial respiration. Although mitochondria are responsive to increased concentrations of ADP in vitro, oxygen extraction in cardiac muscle may increase independently of any significant alterations in cellular ADP levels or of dramatic changes in cellular phosphate metabolites as determined by P-31 NMR. Alterations in ATP/ADP ratios in skeletal muscle with aerobic exercise may be dependent on fiber type, with maintained ATP levels seen in oxidative fibers during muscle work. These data are consistent with increased rates of NADH generation by mitochondrial dehydrogenases, so that ATP production keeps pace with ATP hydrolysis in the cytosol. The mechanism of increased ATP synthesis in muscle mitochondria is termed \"stimulus-response-metabolism coupling.\" Ca2+ ion increases in the muscle cytosol enhance contractility and glycogen breakdown. The Ca2+ signal is then transmitted to the mitochondria to provide matrix Ca2+ concentrations, which activate Ca2+-sensitive dehydrogenase activities, leading to accelerated rates of NAD reduction and oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, Ca2+ signaling to the mitochondria may explain the lack of dramatic fluctuations in the cytosolic phosphorylation potential over a large range of contractile activities in cardiac muscle.\r"

Several types of TT to SR communication have been proposed, including electrical, chemical, and mechanical coupling. Current evidence supports a combination of the latter two. Studies of single rabbit skeletal muscle fibers, skinned by peeling the sarcolemma, demonstrate that a chemical stimulus for SR Ca2+ release, inositol trisphosphate (InsP3), could play a role in skeletal EC coupling. InsP3 appears to open the same SR Ca2+ channel that is activated by caffeine, Ca2+, and depolarization of TTs; all of these stimuli are inhibited by the SR Ca2+ channel blocker ruthenium red.\r"

Possibilities include an increased free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation and a resultant sparing of muscle glycogen as well as an enhancement of neuromuscular function during exercise. In order to further examine these factors, six varsity level runners (VO2max = 63.3 ml.kg-1.min-1) were studied over 90 min of treadmill running (70% VO2max) in a thermoneutral environment in order to determine the metabolic and neuromuscular effects of caffeine (6 mg.kg-1) administered in a randomized, crossover, double-blind manner. Subjects were habitual caffeine consumers (200 mg.d-1) and were given identical diets during each 3-d testing period. Caffeine administration, 60 min prior to exercise, significantly (P less than 0.05) increased plasma FFA levels both prior to and during exercise. Caffeine administration did not alter any of the other variables examined: VO2, HR, RER, rating of perceived exertion; plasma levels of glucose, lactate, epinephrine, and norepinephrine; or neuromuscular function (maximal voluntary strength, peak twitch torque, and motor unit activation). We conclude that caffeine administration (6 mg.kg-1) in athletic, habitual caffeine consumers increased plasma FFA levels but had neither metabolic nor neuromuscular effects that would be of potential ergogenic benefit in endurance running.\r"

On the basis of this information, the effects of 8 wk of run training on ventilatory threshold (VT) and VO2max of eight male children were investigated. Children ranged in age from 10 to 14 yr, with a mean age of 12.4 yr. All subjects were previously untrained. Training consisted of running 4 d.wk-1 for a period of 8 wk. Continuous running was performed 2 d.wk-1 for 10-30 min at 70-80% of VO2max. Interval running was performed the remaining 2 d.wk-1. Repeated intervals of 100-800 m at 90-100% of VO2max were used in this phase of the training. The total distance run for this type of training was 1.5-2.5 km. Incremental treadmill testing prior to and after the training period indicated a 19.4% increase in VT from 30.5 to 36.4 ml.kg-1.min-1 (P less than 0.05). When VT was expressed as a percentage of VO2max, there was a significant (P less than 0.05) increase from 66.6% to 73.8%. VO2max increased 7.5% from 45.9 to 49.4 ml.kg-2.min-2 (P less than 0.05). None of these changes was noted in eight age- and size-matched children who served as control subjects. The results of this study indicate that 8 wk of endurance running training which is of sufficient frequency, intensity, and duration can significantly improve VT and aerobic capacity in male children.\r"

Nerve-implant orthotopic grafting operations were performed on 6-wk-old rats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. A cohort of animals began running 28 d later. Control muscles were from age-matched, untrained rats. Mass and fiber cross-sectional area of grafts were 37 and 66% less than the respective control values at both 56 and 112 d post-grafting. Training increased graft mass by 49% over the non-run graft value of 82 +/- 8 mg at 56 d post-grafting. Continued training did not increase mass further. The grafts of trained rats were 33% greater than untrained at day 112 due to growth of grafts in untrained rats. Running had no effect on fiber cross-sectional area of grafts through 56 d, but by 112 d the cross-sectional area of Type I fibers was 30% greater than the non-run graft value of 1,271 +/- 81 micron2. By 112 d fiber type profiles were not different between control muscle and grafts from trained and untrained rats. We conclude that there is a dissociation between mass and fiber cross-sectional area in grafts compared to control muscle, and training affects these variables by similar magnitudes but at different times.\r"

Fifteen college-age students (eight males, seven females) having no previous history of knee injury were subjects. A triaxial elgon was used to measure the movement of each subject's right and left knees when running on a horizontal or laterally inclined treadmill at 2.4 m.s-1 during each experimental condition (on the horizontal surface and on cambers of +0.087, +0.174, -0.087, and -0.174 radians). There was a significant difference (P less than 0.05) between +0.174 and -0.174 rad camber mean values for all six dependent variables (i.e., support and swing, flexion-extension, internal and external rotation, and valgus-varus range of motion). There was also a significant difference (P less than 0.05) when +0.174 and -0.174 rad camber were compared to 0 rad camber during both the support and swing phases of flexion-extension. Surface camber mean values for +0.087 and -0.087 rad were significantly different (P less than 0.05) during the swing phase for internal and external rotation. This study showed that the kinematics of the knee joint are significantly altered when running on a laterally inclined surface.\r"

  ".W": "The preferred stride frequency (SF) and stride length (SL) of male recreational distance runners were measured on a level treadmill under a variety of conditions over the typical distance running speed range of 3.15-4.12 m.s-1. At a given speed, the correlation coefficients between the subjects' anthropometric variables (APV) (such as stature, leg length, and limb segment mass) and their preferred stride variables were consistently low (less than or equal to 0.36) and not significantly different from zero. As speed increased through the experimental range, SF remained nearly constant (only a 4% increase) while SL increased by 28%. The use of dimensionless velocity was shown to be no more effective than conventional methods in the prediction of a SL vs velocity relationship, but the dimensionless form of the relationship was remarkably similar to those observed for other animal species and other forms of gait. The addition of masses up to 1.1 kg at each ankle produced no significant change in SF or SL. The results indicate that factors other than APV are the primary determinants of preferred SF and SL. Since it has been shown previously that the preferred SL is usually the most economical, APV cannot be used to accurately predict or prescribe SF or SL on an individual basis.\r"

Administration of 1500, 2500, and 3500 rad doses 24 hours before or after ischemia showed that inhibition of spontaneous regeneration is dose dependent and more efficient when irradiation was applied before injury. A single dose of 2500 rad before injury resulted in the formation of a cystic structure ideal for cell implantation. FITC-latex beads and/or carbocyanine dyes were internalized by mononucleated satellite cells in vitro. Labeling did not affect survival or development of these cells. No sign of marker release or spreading from labeled to unlabeled cells was detectable unless by the fusion process. These labels were retained for several weeks. Grafting of labeled dense cellular suspensions into x-irradiated ischemic muscles indicated that satellite cells retain their myogenic characteristic and are able to reform fully differentiated muscle fibers.\r"

In contrast, synaptic transmission remained immature since resistance to presynaptic (magnesium) or postsynaptic (curare) blocking solutions remained reduced. Results suggest that release probability and transmitter stores were smaller than normal. To study the effect of training, animals were allowed to run in wheels. Running caused a delay in reinnervation at 18-20 days, which was, however, abolished by 4 weeks. On the other hand, exercise counteracted development of denervation atrophy. The safety margin of transmission in runners was higher than in nonrunners at 4 weeks, indicating enhanced maturation, but was lower at 2 months of reinnervation. These results suggest that recovery of muscle precedes maturation of synaptic transmission.\r"

Fiber density was measured in 10 patients with a computerized method and neuromuscular jitter in 3 with single-fiber EMG. With age, the EMG abnormality progressed, and \"neuropathic\" EMG features developed in distal muscles. In 9 of 10 patients fiber density was higher than normal. In two of three patients jitter was abnormal. Motor (13 of 13 patients) and sensory (3 of 3 patients) nerve conduction velocities were normal. Our results seem to explain the conflicting reports of EMG in CNM. We conclude that active degeneration and regeneration of muscle fibers takes place in CNM and suggest that the \"neuropathic\" motor unit potentials seen in our patients may be secondary to myopathic disease activity.\r"

Electrical findings in myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, and botulinum intoxication are discussed from the subcellular level via the cellular level (SFEMG) to the integrated responses of whole muscle (RNS) as a rational means of understanding the technique of clinical repetitive nerve stimulation.\r"

Residual muscle function was estimated by maximal voluntary force, twitch tension, and compound muscle action potential. The recruitment range of MUs was expanded toward higher relative force levels in all patients. Changes in firing rates per unit force increment were larger in patients with more pronounced muscle atrophy. When this effect was accounted for by calculating FRM for increments of 10% of residual maximal force, patients with subnormal motor nerve conduction velocities showed selective impairment of rate modulation. This was not due to intermittent conduction failure. We conclude that the two force-generating mechanisms, recruitment and FRM, show unspecific compensatory changes related to the loss of MUs and also alterations that are specifically related to the neuroaxonal or demyelinating nature of the neuropathy.\r"

  ".W": "The study of muscle fatigue started about a century ago, when it was proposed that the observed decrease in force during prolonged voluntary contractions resulted from changes in central processes which reduced the motor drive. In the middle of this century it was noticed that this loss of force could not be restored by maximal electrical stimulation of the motor nerve, and thus the importance of peripheral mechanisms, located beyond the motoneuron, was emphasized. However, it was not clear which peripheral site was most important in decreasing the muscle mechanical capacity during fatigue. More recently, the comparison between peripheral failures during sustained and intermittent contractions indicated that recorded mechanical changes underwent deterioration which was not closely related to the recorded electrical changes. It was thus proposed that muscle intracellular processes dominate the force decrease during muscle fatigue. This concept has been substantiated by the study of standard fatigue tests performed in control, trained, and disused human muscles, as reviewed in this paper.\r"

The biopsy specimens were from patients with neurogenic muscle disease whose muscle exhibited fiber type grouping and group atrophy. The use of McAbs revealed heretofore unrecognized coexpression of multiple myosin isoforms in selected fibers in the pathologic samples which was not apparent with ATPase reactions and not present in normal muscle. The fibers containing multiple myosin isoforms were probably undergoing neurally directed fiber type transformation. Furthermore, a small population of fibers in neurogenic specimens expressed a \"prenatal\" myosin signifying the presence of regenerating fibers. We also demonstrated immunocytochemical evidence of the persistence of adult slow myosin in denervated mature human skeletal muscle despite the reputed necessity of innervation for maintenance of expression of this myosin isoform proffered by others.\r"

To determine the clinical importance of confirmed positive test results in asymptomatic blood donors, we followed 156 donors with positive Western blot assays and 80 donors with positive enzyme immunoassays but negative or indeterminate Western blots at 6-month intervals for a mean of 28 months. As compared with Western blot-negative persons, those with positive Western blots were significantly more likely to be black, male, and first-time donors and to have a history of venereal disease, generalized lymphadenopathy on examination, CD4-cell counts lower than 0.4 x 10(9) per liter, IgG levels higher than 18 g per liter, and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen on initial evaluation. In 17 (11 percent) of the Western blot-positive donors, the disease progressed to Class IV (symptomatic disease), according to the Centers for Disease Control system. CD4 counts below 0.2 x 10(9) per liter, IgA levels above 4 g per liter, abnormal proliferative responses to tetanus toxoid, and positive viral cultures were the strongest predictors of disease progression. Among the 80 donors with repeatedly reactive assay results but either negative or indeterminate Western blot assays, there was no evidence of HIV exposure in their histories, physical examinations, or laboratory evaluations, and manifestations of HIV infection developed in none of them. We conclude that a small number of persons with HIV infection continue to donate blood, despite attempts to exclude them, but that donors who test positive on enzyme immunoassay but persistently negative or indeterminate on Western blot assay probably do not represent a risk for the transmission of HIV.\r"

Seven men were assigned in random order to two metabolically identical diets. One diet consisted of 17 snacks per day (the nibbling diet), and the other of three meals per day (the three-meal diet); each diet was followed for two weeks. As compared with the three-meal diet, the nibbling diet reduced fasting serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B by a mean (+/- SE) of 8.5 +/- 2.5 percent (P less than 0.02), 13.5 +/- 3.4 percent (P less than 0.01), and 15.1 +/- 5.7 percent (P less than 0.05), respectively. Although the mean blood glucose level and serum concentrations of free fatty acids, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and triglyceride were similar during both diets, during the nibbling diet the mean serum insulin level decreased by 27.9 +/- 6.3 percent (P less than 0.01) and the mean 24-hour urinary C-peptide output decreased by 20.2 +/- 5.6 percent (P less than 0.02). In addition, the mean 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was lower by 17.3 +/- 5.9 percent (P less than 0.05) at the end of the nibbling diet than at the end of the three-meal diet. The blood glucose, serum insulin, and C-peptide responses to a standardized breakfast and the results of an intravenous glucose-tolerance test conducted at the end of each diet were similar. We conclude that in addition to the amount and type of food eaten, the frequency of meals may be an important determinant of fasting serum lipid levels, possibly in relation to changes in insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Information is incomplete about the rate of expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysms and the risk of rupture in relation to their size. To address these questions, we conducted a population-based study. Of the 370 residents of Rochester, Minn., with an aneurysm initially diagnosed from 1951 through 1984, 181 had the aneurysm documented by ultrasound examination. Among the 103 patients who underwent more than one ultrasound study, the diameter of the aneurysm increased by a median of 0.21 cm per year. Only 24 percent had a rate of expansion of 0.4 cm or more per year. Among the 176 patients who had an unruptured aneurysm at the time of the initial ultrasound study, the cumulative incidence of rupture was 6 percent after 5 years and 8 percent after 10 years. However, the risk of rupture over five years was 0 percent for the 130 patients with an aneurysm less than 5 cm in diameter and 25 percent for the 46 patients with an aneurysm 5 cm or more in diameter. All 16 patients who had ruptures had aneurysms that were 5 cm or more in diameter at the time of the rupture. These population-based data challenge the clinical perception that aneurysms typically expand at a rate of 0.4 to 0.5 cm per year. Our data also suggest that for aneurysms less than 5 cm in diameter the risk of rupture is considerably lower than has been reported previously. However, the risk of rupture is substantial for aneurysms 5 cm or more in diameter.\r"

Thick filaments, however, are not vital for supporting movement in vitro. Previously we have demonstrated that actin filaments can move continuously on myosin fragments (subfragment-1 or heavy meromyosin (HMM] that are bound to a nitrocellulose surface. Here we report that actin filaments can move in opposite directions on tracks of myosin heads formed when actin filaments decorated with HMM are placed on a nitrocellulose surface. The actin filaments always move forward, frequently changing the direction of the movement, but never move backward reversing the polarity of the movement. The direction of movement is therefore determined by the polarity of the actin filament. These results indicate that myosin heads have considerable flexibility.\r"

The subtlety of calcium regulation by inositol phosphates is emphasized by recent studies that have revealed oscillations in calcium concentration which are perhaps part of a frequency-encoded second-messenger system.\r"

  ".U": "89384897\r", 
  ".W": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of progressive intellectual failure in aged humans. The filamentous brain lesions which define the disease occur within neurons (neurofibrillary tangles), in extracellular cerebral deposits (amyloid plaques) and in meningocerebral blood vessels (amyloid angiopathy). They are found in lesser numbers in the brains of virtually all old humans. A protein with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of approximately 4,000, designated amyloid beta-protein or amyloid A4 protein, is the subunit of the vascular and plaque amyloid filaments in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, normal ageing and trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome). The amyloid beta-protein is a small fragment of a membrane-associated glycoprotein, encoded by a gene on human chromosome 21 which is telomeric to a genetic defect that causes at least some cases of familial Alzheimer's disease. Until now, the pathological lesions of the disease have been found only in the brain, although reports of phenotypic abnormalities in non-neural tissues have suggested that Alzheimer's disease may be a widespread, systemic disorder. Here we report the detection of amyloid beta-protein deposits in non-neural tissues and blood vessels of Alzheimer's disease patients, including skin, subcutaneous tissue and intestine. The protein was also present in non-neural tissues in a proportion of aged, normal subjects. Our findings indicate that a principal feature of the disease process is expressed subclinically in tissues other than brain. The occurrence of amyloid beta-protein deposits in multiple tissues suggests that the protein may be produced locally in numerous organs or may, as in other human amyloidoses, be derived from a common circulating precursor. These observations affect the rationale for many experiments analysing the amyloid beta-protein precursor and its messenger RNAs in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue and have major implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease.\r"

  ".U": "89384898\r", 
  ".W": "A CENTRAL assumption about long-term potentiation in the hippocampus is that the two classes of glutamate-receptor ion channel, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and the kainate/quisqualate (non-NMDA) subtypes, are co-localized at individual excitatory synapses. This assumption is important because of the perceived interplay between NMDA and non-NMDA receptors in the induction and expression of long-term potentiation: the NMDA class, by virtue of its voltage-dependent channel block by magnesium and calcium permeability, provides the trigger for the induction of long-term potentiation, whereas the actual enhancement of synaptic efficacy is thought to be provided by the non-NMDA class. If both receptor subtypes are present at the one synapse, such cross-modulation could occur rapidly and locally through diffusible factors. By measuring miniature synaptic currents in cultured hippocampal neurons we show that the majority (approximately 70%) of the excitatory synapses on a postsynaptic cell possess both kinds of receptor, although to different extents. Of the remaining excitatory synapses, approximately 20% contain only the non-NMDA subtype and the rest possess only NMDA receptors. This finding provides direct evidence for co-localization of glutamate-receptor subtypes at individual synapses, and also points to the possibility that long-term potentiation might be differentially expressed at each synapse according to the mix of receptor subtypes at that synapse.\r"

  ".U": "89384899\r", 
  ".W": "The endocrine part of the pancreas plays a central role in blood-glucose regulation. It is well established that an elevation of glucose concentration reduces secretion of the hyperglycaemia-associated hormone glucagon from pancreatic alpha 2 cells. The mechanisms involved, however, remain unknown. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that alpha 2 cells generate Ca2+-dependent action potentials. The frequency of these action potentials, which increases under conditions that stimulate glucagon release, is not affected by glucose or insulin. The inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is present in the endocrine part of the pancreas at concentrations comparable to those encountered in the central nervous system, and co-localizes with insulin in pancreatic beta cells. We now describe a mechanism whereby GABA, co-secreted with insulin from beta cells, may mediate part of the inhibitory action of glucose on glucagon secretion by activating GABAA-receptor Cl- channels in alpha 2 cells. These observations provide a model for feedback regulation of glucagon release, which may be of significance for the understanding of the hypersecretion of glucagon frequently associated with diabetes.\r"

Excellent activity against several gram-negative organisms sometimes permits substitution of the safer cephalosporins for the aminoglycosides, thus avoiding potential renal and otic toxicities. However, these advantages come with costs of their own, such as superinfection, induction of resistance, and the potential for clinical bleeding. Nevertheless, these adverse effects fortunately are infrequent and, with careful monitoring, they can be readily avoided or controlled. Therefore, the increasing number and diversity of these helpful agents should be accompanied by greater knowledge of all these factors. This should result in increasing benefits for our patients, without sacrificing cost, safety, and future therapeutic success.\r"

  ".W": "Infections observed after gynecologic surgical procedures are polymicrobial and require parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy until the patient has been afebrile 24 to 72 hours. Therapy should be tailored to the specific infection and patient response thereto. When the infections are complicated by abscess or infected hematoma, combination therapy appears to be effective in a shorter period of time, and surgical drainage is infrequently necessary other than drainage of those in the supravaginal, extraperitoneal space. Administration of antibiotics immediately before surgery to women at high risk for postoperative infection has essentially eliminated pelvic infections. These infections range from cuff cellulitis through pelvic abscess and include pelvic thrombophlebitis. Pelvic infections and those in an abdominal, perineal, or vaginal incision can occur during the immediate postoperative period or after discharge from the hospital. As many as 50 per cent of these infections may occur after the patient is discharged from the hospital. Without question, the most appropriate means of objectively identifying infection rates, appropriate and inappropriate use of antimicrobials, and trends in morbidity is with an infection control program, usually consisting of an epidemiologist or specially trained nurses. Their contribution to appropriate patient care is significant. Information uncovered may put some clinicians on the defensive. This need not happen if gynecologic surgeons participate in and define criteria to be used for various infection diagnoses and similar situations. These diagnoses must be based on physical examination evidence, not \"presumptive evidence.\" Antimicrobial administration and selection has an emotional component; objective evaluation avoids this bias. Optimal and efficient patient care is the goal and these programs should be established with that as their only goal. Several synergistic polymicrobial infections involve skin, subcutaneous tissue, and perhaps fascia; these are infrequently observed but require prompt recognition and antimicrobial therapy as well as wide surgical excision to healthy tissue to effect a cure. Clinical presentation extends to both ends of the spectrum with respect to degree of illness. These infections also occur spontaneously in gynecologic sites, and do so only in patients at high risk, such as those with diabetes, delibitating disease, advanced age, or evidence of arteriosclerotic disease. Another infection that was diagnosed and managed only surgically (that is, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis) can now be accurately diagnosed without surgery and can be adequately treated medically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The realization that posterior chamber intraocular lenses have many advantages over anterior chamber ones has induced many practitioners to try methods of fixating the lenses in the ciliary sulcus when there is inadequate capsular support. Most of these methods require the use of sutures to anchor the lens to the sclera or the iris. We describe a modification of these techniques which allows the surgeon to place a stiff all-polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lens in the sulcus in a way that makes it unnecessary to anchor the lens, although a safety suture may be placed through the scleral lip. We believe this modification makes sulcus fixation simpler to perform and possibly safer for the patient. We have used this technique in six patients with good results.\r"

Surgical treatment includes drainage of the hemorrhage through sclerotomies and reformation of the anterior chamber with balanced salt solution or air. Two patients are presented whose suprachoroidal hemorrhages were managed with the instillation of 10% sodium hyaluronate. The intraocular administration of a space-occupying fluid produces an even distribution of hydraulic force to facilitate drainage of the hemorrhage and avoids the optical problems associated with the use of intraocular air. While most cases of suprachoroidal hemorrhage can be effectively managed using balanced salt solution or air, we believe that viscoelastic agents may be of special benefit in selected situations.\r"

The addition of dipivefrin resulted in an IOP reduction of 2 mmHg or more in 50% and 3 mmHg or more in 19% of the eyes throughout the 12-week therapy.

Enucleation was not done, however, because of the patient's age and the unusual transillumination properties of the lesion. Instead the tumor was resected by a partial lamellar iridocyclochoroidectomy with an excellent visual outcome. Light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry established that the tumor was a leiomyoma. A literature review showed that all but one of the 15 previously reported cases of ciliary body leiomyoma that the authors were able to verify were found in women with an average age of 30 years. The possible significance of this apparent age and sex predilection for this unusual tumor is discussed, and the clinical features which may help differentiate leiomyoma from uveal melanoma are presented.\r"

Techniques and clinical observations using a plaque-type device capable of delivering microwave hyperthermia to intraocular tumors are described. Iodine-125 plaque irradiation (48-88 Gy to apex), together with microwave hyperthermia (46 degrees-52.5 degrees C to base), were given to patients during one brachytherapy session. Since October 1985, 15 medium and 3 large-sized tumors were treated. Clinical observations include partial clearing of six vitreous opacities as well as three retinal detachments noted before treatment. Objective measurements of improved visual acuity were noted in seven of the nine cases. All tumors responded to treatment, but one tumor had regrowth and the eye was enucleated. These data suggest that a microwave plaque can be used to deliver hyperthermia to human choroidal melanomas. Within the range of the follow-up period, no side effects that might preclude the use of this hyperthermia system for choroidal melanoma treatment were noted.\r"

The frequency of HLA-B35 was significantly decreased in the patient group (p corrected = 0.018). Consequently, the relative risk of development of RHL in a subject positive for HLA-B35 was 20 times smaller than in a subject who does not bear B35. Furthermore, a study was made of the possible relationship between the presence of HLA-B35 antigen and antibody titers to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in 62 persons affected or not by RHL. Significantly elevated titers to HSV-1 were found in the diseased group (p less than 0.001), but the geometric mean of antibody titers in HLA-B35 positive subjects was not different from that of B35 negative subjects either of RHL-affected or in healthy persons. These data are in a good agreement with the hypothesis that humoral immune responses play a marginal role in the protection from HSV-1 recurrences.\r"

Radiographs were made of extracted premolars with either large or small recurrent carious lesions simulated adjacent to Class II amalgam or composite restorations with both E-speed and D-speed intraoral film. For each restorative material, teeth that had no simulated caries were compared with teeth that had small and large simulated caries. Recurrent caries is detected best when the lesion is adjacent to radiopaque composite restorations, and detection is poorest when the lesion is next to radiolucent composite restorations. Large carious lesions are identified correctly more often than small lesions, although many lesions are not detected at all, especially those adjacent to radiolucent composite materials. There is no difference between E-speed and D-speed film for the detection of recurrent carious lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The literature on the utility of cognitive coping strategies in pain control has been unclear because of 2 principal limitations: the lack of a validated classification system, and reliance on qualitative and quasi-statistical reviews. In this study, an empirically based multidimensional taxonomy was employed to categorize the variety of cognitive coping strategies into 6 major classes: external focus of attention, neutral imaginings, pleasant imaginings, dramatized coping, rhythmic cognitive activity and pain acknowledging. Meta-analytic techniques were introduced to evaluate the overall efficacy of cognitive strategies (in comparison to no-treatment controls), the relative efficacy of these strategies (how the different groups of strategies compare with one another), and the substantive efficacy of such strategies (how cognitive strategies fare against placebo/expectancy conditions). Results revealed that, in general, cognitive coping strategies are more effective in alleviating pain as compared to either no-treatment or expectancy controls. Each individual class of strategies significantly attenuates pain although the imagery methods are the most effective whereas pain acknowledging is the least effective. Positive expectancy is no better than no treatment. These findings stand in contrast with previous reviews that have not assigned prime importance to imagery or for that matter have not shown cognitive strategies to be particularly effective. Results are discussed with reference to attentional models and methodological issues.\r"

Although sensitivity of any single defect is generally low for many known teratogens, the presence of specific defect combinations is usually predictive of the teratogen. To evaluate the patterns of birth defects associated with diabetic embryopathy, a sensitivity-specificity analysis was performed on 4929 infants with major defects ascertained by the population-based Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program between 1968 and 1980. By reviewing hospital records, maternal insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was confirmed in 26 infants. Patterns of defects were evaluated among infants born to mothers with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and compared with the rest of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program case population. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess defect combinations that predict for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Of 26 infants, 8 had multiple defects. However, most defects and their combinations were poorly sensitive and predictive for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The predictive value for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was greatest for the combination of vertebral and cardiovascular anomalies (6.5%). Also, several pathogenetic mechanisms were noted among patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, such as cell migration defects, cell death events, deformations, and cardiac flow lesions. The inability to find a clear-cut phenotype for diabetic embryopathy may be due to several etiologic factors and mechanisms associated with diabetic embryopathy.\r"

The mutated tRNA was tested for its ability to read glycine codons in an in vitro protein-synthesizing system programmed with the phage message MS2-RNA that had been modified by site-directed mutagenesis so as to make it possible to monitor conveniently the reading of all four glycine codons. The results showed that while the efficiency of tRNA(1Gly) (UCC) was comparable to that of mycoplasma tRNA(Gly) (UCC) in the reading of the codon GGA, the mycoplasma tRNA(Gly) was far more efficient than the tRNA(1Gly) (UCC) in the reading of the codons GGU and GGC. Thus, the anticodon UCC, when present in the structural context of the tRNA(1Gly) molecule, behaved as predicted by the wobble rules while in the structural context of the mycoplasma tRNA(Gly) it read without discrimination between the nucleotides in the third codon position, in violation of the wobble restrictions. The result with the codon GGG showed that the anticodon UCC, when present in tRNA(1Gly), was considerably less efficient in reading this codon than it was in the structural context of the mycoplasma tRNA(Gly). It would therefore seem that the anticodon UCC, when present in a certain tRNA, can be an efficient wobbler, while in the molecular environment of another tRNA it is markedly restricted in its ability to wobble.\r"

  ".W": "The genomic sequencing procedure is applied to the direct sequencing of uncharacterized regions of bacterial DNA by a \"multiplex walking\" approach. Samples of bulk Escherichia coli DNA are cut with various restriction enzymes, subjected to chemical sequencing degradations, run in a sequencing gel, and transferred to nylon membranes. When a labeled oligomer is hybridized to a membrane, a sequence ladder appears wherever the probe lies near a restriction cut. New probes, based on sequence that lies beyond other restriction sites, are then synthesized, and the membranes are reprobed to reveal new sequence. Repeated cycles of oligomer probe synthesis and subsequent reprobing permit rapid sequence walking along the genome. This oligomer walking technique was used to sequence the pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) gene in E. coli without resorting to cloning or to library construction. The sequenced region was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and subsequently transcribed and translated using both in vivo and in vitro systems, and the resultant gene product characterized to show that the gene encodes the type I isoform of pyruvate kinase.\r"

Furthermore, in the proofreading step ribosomes programmed by UUC discriminate less well than ribosomes programmed by UUU against two of three near-cognate Leu-tRNAs, and ribosomes programmed by CUC discriminate less well than ribosomes programmed by CUU against near-cognate Phe-tRNA. The codon-induced change in reaction rate with near-cognate ternary complexes is greater than that with cognate ternary complexes: the most efficient codon is, therefore, the least accurate. Because the efficient, but inaccurate, codon UUC is used preferentially in highly expressed mRNAs of Escherichia coli, maximization of translational accuracy apparently has not been significant in the evolution of this particular biased codon choice in E. coli.\r"

Maximal activity of the holo-D86/92-lysozyme was observed at 80 degrees C, where its relative activity normalized to the value at 40 degrees C was 6-fold and 17-fold higher than those of the native and apoenzymes, respectively.

Progeny of self-pollinated plants were challenged with TMV to determine their resistance to infection. Plants that expressed RNA sequences complementary to the CP coding region and the 3' untranslated region, including the tRNA-like sequences, were protected from infection by TMV at low levels of inoculum. However, plants that expressed RNA complementary to the CP coding sequence alone were not protected from infection. These results indicate that sequences complementary to the terminal 117 nucleotides of TMV, which include a putative replicase binding site, are responsible for the protection. However, the level of protection in these plants was considerably less than in transgenic plants that expressed the TMV CP gene and accumulated CP. Since the mechanisms of protection in the two systems are different, it may be possible to increase protection by introducing both sequences into transgenic plants.\r"

The reconstituted system shows initial rates of transport that are comparable to those obtained with right-side-out membrane vesicles and it establishes a 100-fold concentration gradient for histidine. Proteoliposomes also transport histidine when GTP replaces ATP. Proteoliposomes do not catalyze significant ATP hydrolysis until histidine transport is initiated by addition of substrate along with HisJ, the water-soluble histidine-binding protein. Both initially and throughout the course of substrate transport there is a concomitant hydrolysis of ATP, with an apparent stoichiometry (ATP/histidine) of 5:1. These experiments demonstrate directly that ATP is the source of energy for periplasmic permeases, thus resolving previous controversies on this topic.\r"

Cells that tumbled at intermediate frequencies formed much larger swarms, even when deleted for many of the genes known to be required for chemotaxis. Surprisingly, the higher the tumble frequency, the larger the swarms. Microscopic examination revealed that tumbles enable cells to back away from obstructions in the agar.

These binding characteristics were consistent with the biological activities of IL-3 and GM-CSF on eosinophils and with the lack of stimulation of neutrophil function by IL-3. Specificity studies under conditions shown to prevent receptor internalization showed that the binding of 125I-labeled IL-3 to eosinophils was partially inhibited by GM-CSF but not by other cytokines. Reciprocal experiments with 125I-labeled GM-CSF showed that IL-3 but not other cytokines partially inhibited binding to eosinophils. In contrast, the binding of 125I-labeled GM-CSF to neutrophils was not inhibited by IL-3 or other cytokines tested. Quantitative inhibition binding experiments on eosinophils showed that the reciprocal inhibition between IL-3 and GM-CSF was not complete up to a concentration of heterologous ligand of 100 nM. These results show that (i) IL-3 binds to eosinophils but not neutrophils and (ii) IL-3 and GM-CSF specifically interact on the surface of eosinophils, providing a possible mechanism for the overlapping activities of IL-3 and GM-CSF on these cells.\r"

Dual-excitation flow cytometry was used to calibrate the pH-dependence of 6-carboxyfluorescein fluorescence in vivo. Vacuoles in wild-type yeast were mildly acidic, pH 6.2, in cells grown under several different conditions. Cultures labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein were screened by fluorescence-ratio microscopy to detect mutants that had defects related to vacuolar acidification. A recessive nuclear mutation, vph1-1, caused an abnormally high vacuolar pH of 6.9, as assayed by flow cytometry, and eliminated vacuolar uptake of the weak base quinacrine. Acidification in a pep12::LEU2 mutant appeared defective by fluorescence-ratio microscopy and quinacrine-uptake assays, but the vacuolar pH in the pep12::LEU2 mutant was nearly normal (pH 6.3) in flow cytometric assays.\r"

This construct was injected into fertilized mouse eggs, and its expression was analyzed in the primitive and definitive erythroid cells, as well as the brain of 14-day embryos. All six transgenic individuals that contained intact copies of the construct expressed the transgene in an erythroid-specific fashion. Expression was observed in both primitive and definitive erythroid cells. This is in marked contrast to previous transgenic mice experiments using the same A gamma-globin gene fragment in isolation, where expression was restricted to primitive erythroid cells. Our results show that the region containing the developmentally stable globin locus hypersensitive sites changes the developmental stage specificity of a human fetal globin gene in transgenic mice. These observations imply that sequences additional to those used here are involved in the developmental control of fetal globin gene expression in vivo. The ability to express fetal globin in adult erythroid cells allows one to consider using fetal globin genes for gene therapy of sickle cell disease.\r"

Furthermore, nonribosomal DNA sequences retain their RAD50-dependence even when inserted into the ribosomal DNA array. We argue that these data provide evidence for at least two pathways of meiotic intrachromosomal recombination whose activity depends on the specific sequences involved or their structural context in the chromosome. In contrast to its role in meiosis, RAD50 is not required for either inter- or intrachromosomal spontaneous mitotic recombination.\r"

The structure of one R gene, Lc, was determined by sequencing cDNA and genomic clones. The putative Lc protein, deduced from the cDNA sequence, is composed of 610 amino acids and has homology to the helix-loop-helix DNA-binding/dimerization motif found in the L-myc gene product and other regulatory proteins. It also contains a large acidic domain that may be involved in transcriptional activation. Consistent with its proposed role as a transcriptional activator is our finding that a functional R gene is required for the accumulation of transcripts of at least two genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. We discuss the possibility that the diverse patterns of anthocyanin pigmentation conditioned by different R genes reflect differences in the R gene promoters rather than their gene products.\r"

  ".W": "The granules of natural killer (NK) cells contain cytolysin and serine proteases, proteins that are expressed specifically in cytolytic cells and are released in response to target binding. We have used immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy to localize these proteins with respect to the various morphological compartments of granules in a rat NK cell line. Both cytolysin and the proteases are limited to the core regions of the dense core granules. While these proteins are targeted to the same compartment, they differ markedly in their posttranslational processing. Cytolysin bears N-linked oligosaccharides that are converted to the complex type, while the major trypsin-like protease, granzyme A, bears only high-mannose-type oligosaccharides. The glycans of granzyme A, but not those of cytolysin, are modified with phosphomannose moieties. These results suggest that one possible mechanism for packaging proteins into NK granules is the mannose 6-phosphate-dependent lysosomal targeting system. However, the absence of the mannose 6-phosphate modification from cytolysin suggests the existence of yet another targeting system.\r"

Here we describe a strategy for labeling monoclonal antibodies and F(ab')2 fragments with 211At by means of the bifunctional reagent N-succinimidyl 3-(trimethylstannyl)benzoate. An intact antibody, 81C6, and the F(ab')2 fragment of Me1-14 (both reactive with human gliomas) were labeled with 211At in high yield and with a specific activity of up to 4 mCi/mg in a time frame compatible with the 7.2-hr half-life of 211At. Quantitative in vivo binding assays demonstrated that radioastatination was accomplished with maintenance of high specific binding and affinity. Comparison of the biodistribution of 211At-labeled Me1-14 F(ab')2 to that of a nonspecific antibody fragment labeled with 211At and 131I in athymic mice bearing D-54 MG human glioma xenografts demonstrated selective and specific targeting of 211At-labeled antibody in this human tumor model.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoblot characterization and immunofluorescence localization of dystrophin are presented for 76 human patients with various neuromuscular diseases. Normal dystrophin (shown by immunoblotting) was invariably visualized as a continuous, peripheral membrane immunostaining of myofibers. Biochemical abnormalities of dystrophin (either lower or higher molecular weight dystrophin) resulted in patchy, discontinuous immunostaining, suggesting that the abnormal dystrophin proteins are not capable of creating a complete membrane cytoskeleton network. There was a very strong correlation of clinical diagnoses with the type of dystrophin abnormality; all Duchenne muscular dystrophy patient muscle contained no detectable dystrophin, Becker muscular dystrophy patient muscle had clearly abnormal dystrophin, and unrelated diseases showed normal dystrophin. However, a single patient of five carrying the diagnosis of Fukuyama dystrophy showed no detectable dystrophin and thus appeared to be a Duchenne dystrophy patient by the biochemical assays. We know of no other case of a patient with a disease thought to be unrelated to Duchenne/Becker dystrophy yet demonstrating dystrophin deficiency. Based on the data presented, we conclude that immunofluorescence is the best technique for the detection of female carriers of Duchenne dystrophy, whereas immunoblotting appears superior for the prognostic diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy.\r"

After the preliminary characterization of their phenotype and tumor specificity, detailed studies performed with one of the cell lines, W.D., show that it recognizes a specific antigen, a large and heavily glycosylated mucin molecule, expressed on pancreatic and breast tumors and tumor cell lines. Although this recognition appears major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted, the antigen receptor used by the cytotoxic T cell is the alpha/beta heterodimer, typically found on MHC-restricted T cells. The target antigen is atypical, however, in its ability to directly bind and activate the T cells in the absence of self MHC, presumably by abundant and regularly repeated antigenic epitopes. These findings are important because they demonstrate a specific T-cell response against a human tumor-associated antigen. In addition to pancreatic and breast tumors, various mucin molecules are known to be produced by other tumors of epithelial cell origin and could be expected to stimulate similar T-cell-mediated immune responses.\r"

The product of the insertionally activated c-erbB locus lacks the extracellular ligand-binding domain and is strictly leukemogenic. It has previously been demonstrated that the disease spectrum associated with aberrant c-erbB expression can be expanded by structural perturbation of the cytoplasmic domain of this protein. In this report, we use mutagenesis and retroviral vectors to identify specific mutations in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the insertionally activated c-erbB product that are sufficient to activate the sarcomagenic potential of this protein. Interestingly, a point mutation in the kinase domain appears to be sufficient for sarcomagenic activation. However, removal of the terminal tyrosine residue of the c-erbB product, implicated in modulating kinase activity, does not lead to a fully transforming phenotype. These studies suggest that there are multiple ways to activate the fibroblast-transforming potential of the insertionally activated c-erbB product. The conformation of this protein may play a more significant role in oncogenic activation than the phosphorylation status of the putative carboxyl-terminal autophosphorylation site.\r"

With plastic surfaces as a model 9-hr culture with GM-CSF was necessary for enhancement, and maximum levels were obtained after 24-hr stimulation. GM-CSF-stimulated adherence must require new RNA and protein synthesis because actinomycin D and cycloheximide abolished existing adherence and prevented further monocyte attachment. Interestingly, shorter incubations (1-2 hr) with cycloheximide increased adherence, suggesting a labile inhibitor. Formaldehyde fixation of monocytes but not of human vein endothelial cells abolished adherence, indicating the need for actively metabolizing monocytes. Thus, a hemopoietic growth factor, responsible for the proliferation and differentiation of monocytes, can also alter their adhesive characteristics. These observations may have important implications in pathological situations and in the in vivo use of GM-CSF.\r"

Analogues of 2-5A that are biologically active and metabolically stable were synthesized and analyzed for antiviral activity against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Replacement of the 3' hydroxyl group of the adenosine moieties of 2-5A with hydrogen atoms (i.e., cordycepin analogues of 2-5A) converted authentic 2-5A trimer into anti-HIV-1 agents in vitro. These cordycepin analogues of 2-5A also inhibited partially purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Introduction of chirality into the 2',5'-phosphodiester internucleotide linkages or 5'-phosphate moieties of the 2-5A molecule (i.e., phosphorothioate analogues of 2-5A) converted authentic 2-5A into more potent inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. However, these phosphorothioate 2-5As demonstrated little or no anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro. Thus, some analogues of 2-5A may form a class of anti-HIV-1 drugs with possible pleiotropic activities that include activation of latent RNase L and inhibition of reverse transcription.\r"

It requires both membrane and cytosolic components, the latter including 47- and 67-kDa proteins recognized by the polyclonal antiserum B-1. Immunoscreening of an induced HL-60 lambda ZAP cDNA library yielded seven cross-hybridizing cDNAs encoding the 47-kDa component. Fusion proteins of 22-50 kDa were recognized by B-1. Antiserum against a fusion protein recognized a 47-kDa protein in normal neutrophils but not in those from patients with autosomal chronic granulomatous disease who lack the 47-kDa cytosolic oxidase component. In a cell-free NADPH oxidase system full-length and C-terminal fusion proteins augmented superoxide generation and reconstituted the cytosolic defect of a patient missing the 47-kDa protein. The cDNA hybridized with a 1.4-kilobase mRNA from induced HL-60 cells. The longest cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 41,440 Da with a calculated pI of 10.4, an N-terminal glycine, sites favorable for phosphorylation, a nucleotide binding domain, and a region of homology to the src protein kinases, phospholipase C, and alpha-fodrin. These structural features are pertinent to proposed functional roles of the protein in the respiratory burst oxidase.\r"

We now have examined 113 independent clinical isolates of E. coli for the existence of msDNA and found that 7 strains contained msDNA. Four of them were further analyzed by hybridization analysis, which indicated that three of the msDNAs were different, having little sequence homology. When the reverse transcriptase gene associated with one of these msDNAs was used as a probe, it did not hybridize with chromosomal DNA from the other strains containing msDNA. These results indicate that some clinical E. coli strains carry their own unique msDNA-synthesizing systems; msDNAs produced by these systems have little, if any, sequence homology in their RNA and DNA molecules and the reverse transcriptases required for the production of msDNA also have little sequence similarity. Such extensive diversity of the msDNA-synthesizing systems supports the notion that they were acquired by the E. coli genome late during the evolution of E. coli.\r"

By using a monoclonal antibody directed against the GA, we confirmed the known distribution of the GA in myogenic cells: a juxtanuclear polarized organization in myoblasts and a perinuclear nonpolarized distribution in myotubes. In contrast, the innervated anterior latissimus dorsi muscle of \"young adult\" chicks displayed a focal distribution of GA that appeared restricted to areas located underneath the motor end plates identified by alpha-bungarotoxin fluorescent labeling of the acetylcholine receptor. Five days after denervation of anterior latissimus dorsi muscle, a striking reorganization and expansion of the GA was observed. The GA now showed a perinuclear distribution in close association with every nucleus of the muscle fibers as observed in myotubes. The focal distribution of the GA in innervated muscle fibers and its remodeling upon denervation are interpreted in terms of a model of local synthesis, processing, and routing of acetylcholine receptor to the end plate and of regulation of these processes by functional motor innervation.\r"

Using Northern blot analysis, we have detected two forms of ET mRNA in rat tissues: a 3.7-kilobase form in the kidney, eye, and brain, a 2.5-kilobase form in the intestine, and both forms in the lung. We have localized these forms of ET mRNA in several rat tissues using in situ hybridization. In the 19-day rat fetus, ET mRNA is highest in the lung, intestine, and meninges. At high resolution, ET mRNA is localized in the lung to respiratory epithelial cells of bronchioles and apparently in blood vessels. In adult tissues, ET mRNA is present throughout the lung, in the renal medulla vasa recta, and in the iris of the eye. ET mRNA is synthesized in close proximity to ET binding sites in many organs (e.g., lung, kidney, intestine, and eye), suggesting a local action of this peptide. However, in other areas (e.g., heart and renal cortex), ET binding sites are present in the absence of ET mRNA, suggesting an action of ET from the bloodstream or from neurons. Northern blot analysis of ET mRNA in microvascular endothelial cells in culture indicates that ET is synthesized in small blood vessels and regulated similarly to its regulation in large vessels. Our results provide evidence that ET, like other regulatory peptides, may serve in several tissues as a neuromodulator or local hormone.\r"

After the program randomly selects a lesion, the user attempts to find the lesion in as few guesses (manual muscle tests) as possible. As muscles are selected (muscle tested), the computer searches the table to find the appropriate \"strength\" of weak or normal, based on the location of the randomly selected lesion. After displaying the strength of the muscle selected, a graphic representation of the strength is shown on a diagram of the brachial plexus. The graphic aspect of the program helps the user to visualize areas of the brachial plexus that may still contain the lesion. While playing the Lesion Game, the user can view a detailed picture of the brachial plexus, view all the possible lesions of the Lesion Game, or view charts of upper extremity innervations. An additional program mode allows beginning users to view and study muscle innervations without having to solve lesions. The program is extremely simple to use because it is entirely mouse-driven.\r"

In most patients, an improvement in the aesthetic disability is the primary objective. In general, an operation is indicated for the classical \"congenital\" muscular torticollis that does not respond to physiotherapy and forceful stretching of the restricting neck band. The mass or \"tumor\" of \"congenital\" torticollis requires no specific treatment. Operation may be delayed until age 1, but should probably be completed prior to school age. Reversal of craniofacial asymmetry is best achieved at an early age when there is maximum growth potential. Principles of surgery are (1) identification and release of all restricting bands involving the sternocleidomastoid muscle and other neck structures, (2) moving of the head and neck through a full range of motion prior to the completion of the procedure, and (3) resumption of physical therapy within 2 weeks of operation to prevent recurrent scar contracture. Various operations have been recommended, the most popular and reliable being inferior open tenotomy of the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Incisions should be placed low in the neck along skin lines and not over the clavicle in order to avoid hypertrophic scarring. Other procedures discussed are superior open sternocleidomastoid tenotomy (mastoid release), muscle lengthening procedures, and sternocleidomastoid excision. Only modest results should be anticipated in older children or adults with long-standing disease or advanced craniofacial asymmetry.\r"

  ".W": "Not every laryngeal abnormality requires imaging. If a lesion is small and there is no evidence of deep extension, the clinician can derive all visual examination. Similarly, when a lesion is large and obviously involves both true and false cords (transglottic), the clinician already knows that a total laryngectomy is necessary and imaging is of little value unless there is a question about nodal involvement. The real value of imaging is in the questionable cases in which a decision must be made about the feasibility of speech conservation therapy. The radiologist must understand the various conservation techniques and the key information needed to determine the feasibility of each. In cases in which patients are able to cooperate with the examination, MR with multiplanar imaging capabilities and increased tissue differentiation has, in my view, an edge over CT. However, many patients cannot cooperate, and in these cases CT provides a more consistently good examination. Some centers rely totally on CT and some rely completely on MR imaging units with low or middle field strength. Either can give excellent laryngeal imaging. At my institution, with a high-field-strength unit, MR imaging is the first choice if the patient is fairly cooperative and is thought able to undergo the examination. Even if the patient cannot tolerate the entire protocol, the examination usually provides enough necessary information. If the patient has major problems with secretions or has difficulty cooperating, we do not try MR imaging but use CT; the examination is almost always adequate even though restricted to one plane. The imaging modality used is less important than the radiologist's knowledge of the key anatomic landmarks. The most important landmarks, from a surgeon's perspective, are the ventricle, anterior commissure, and the cricoid cartilage. The structures most helpful in identifying the position of the ventricle are the paraglottic fat, the thyroarytenoid muscle, and the arytenoid cartilage. The clinician remains responsible for evaluating the mucosal surface. The goal of the radiologic examination is to find deep tumoral extension that the clinician cannot see.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-nine patients with pelvic cancers (101 bladder carcinomas, 27 prostatic carcinomas, and 11 testicular tumors) considered for radical surgery were studied with lymphography and percutaneous fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, and the results were correlated with lymphadenectomy. Adequate material for FNA was obtained in 97%, 88%, and 100% of the bladder, prostatic, and testicular tumors, respectively. For bladder carcinoma, the global accuracy was 58% for lymphography and 93% for FNA; the high false-negative rate for lymphography (48%) was lowered to 25% with FNA, providing that the obturator nodes were punctured. For prostatic carcinomas, it was not possible to evaluate the true-positive rate because the patients with positive FNA results did not under-go surgery. For testicular tumors, lymphography and FNA had almost the same global accuracy (73% and 75%), but FNA had a better specificity (100%) than lymphography (86%). FNA had no false-positive results, which means that positive biopsy results obviate radical surgery; when FNA results are negative a lymphadenectomy should be performed. With its mild morbidity, FNA has a role in the preoperative staging of pelvic carcinomas.\r"

Multiple imaging modalities were used to characterize these lesions, including magnetic resonance imaging in one case. Percutaneous aspiration was performed on four of the six cysts - in one case, in the operating room prior to excision of the cyst. Cholesterol was detected in four cysts and cortisol in one cyst. Cytologic findings from aspiration biopsy were benign in all five cases. Two cysts were removed, one of them after reaccumulation of the fluid after needle aspiration. The findings in this small series of adrenal cysts suggest that in certain cases, complete cyst aspiration, rather than surgical excision, may be carried out initially for diagnosis and management of indeterminate suprarenal cystic lesions and symptomatic cysts of the adrenal gland.\r"

Ninety-eight duplex US examinations were performed, and the Doppler arterial resistive indexes (RIs) correlated with clinical events after transplantation. The RI was 0.70 or less in the parenchymal vessels in all instances of normal transplant function and greater than 0.70 in seven of eight clinical episodes of rejection (87.5%). In all studies performed during these eight cases of rejection, the positive predictive value of an RI exceeding 0.70 was 100%. The negative predictive value of an RI of less than 0.70 in excluding rejection was 90%. High RI values were not found in isolated episodes of cyclosporine toxicity, pancreatitis, peripancreatic hemorrhage, or infection. Duplex US may prove to be more accurate in the diagnosis of rejection of pancreatic transplants versus renal transplants because the former cases have fewer causes of increased vascular impedance and diminished perfusion.\r"

The occurrence or severity of nerve injury did not correlate well with the size or presence of an observable axillary or arm hematoma. Dissection of the axillae and arms of 25 human cadavers revealed a tough medial brachial fascial compartment (MBFC) outside a thin axillary sheath. The median and ulnar nerves were within the MBFC at an arterial puncture site just lateral to the anterior axillary fold. The radial and musculocutaneous nerves exited the MBFC more proximally. The different levels at which the major nerves of the brachial plexus exit the MBFC explain the anatomic distribution of the nerve injuries associated with compression by a hematoma after transaxillary arteriography.\r"

Fifty-one filters were successfully placed in 51 patients with a dilator set or a balloon angioplasty catheter. Nine focal thrombi were detected in the common femoral vein (19%) and one in the right internal jugular vein (14%). Use of dilators induced eight thrombi (24%), compared with two (10%) from balloon catheters. The left common femoral vein had a high frequency of thrombosis, regardless of dilation technique (five of nine). Of nine patients with acute common femoral vein thrombosis, four became symptomatic within 10 days after the procedure. Patients may remain asymptomatic or have delayed symptoms; thus, US is valuable for determining patients at risk of thrombosis of the common femoral vein.\r"

Of the 69 venotomy sites, 63 were not associated with preexisting thrombosis and were evaluated with compression and Doppler ultrasound within 1 week of placement and over 13-541 days. New thrombosis developed at the puncture site in nine of 63 sites (14.3%), although clinical suspicion of clot was raised in only one patient. Fifty-four sites (85.7%) showed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis, even though three patients had signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombosis. During the follow-up, most new thromboses resolved, yielding a 96.3% long-term patency rate. The authors conclude that postplacement increase in symptoms of venous stasis and occlusion may not correlate with placement site thrombosis. New filters should be evaluated for their ability to capture potential pulmonary emboli while maintaining caval patency and for mechanical and biologic stability because placement site complications occur at low rates and resolve in most cases.\r"

The results confirmed the inability of MR imaging alone to distinguish most benign lesions from malignant ones. Malignant lesions were distinguished from benign lesions on the basis of significantly higher mean peak ratios of phosphomonoester (PME) to beta-nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) and of phosphodiester to NTP, a significantly lower mean peak area ratio of phosphocreatine to NTP, and a higher mean pH. The diagnostic performance of the PME/NTP peak area ratio is characterized by a sensitivity (true-positive fraction) of 1.00 and a specificity (true-negative fraction) of 0.93. This study provided preliminary evidence that P-31 MR spectroscopy may be used to improve diagnostic specificity in bone and soft-tissue lesions.\r"

Most MR examinations consisted of T1-weighted sagittal imaging of the entire spine, with additional sequences as needed for clarification. Extradural masses were found in 46 patients, 25 of whom had cord compression. For extradural masses causing cord compression, the sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging was .92 and .90, respectively, compared with .95 and .88 for myelography. For extradural masses without cord compression the sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging was .73 and .90, versus .49 and .88 for myelography. MR imaging was much more sensitive for metastases to bone (.90 vs .49), as expected. MR imaging is an acceptable alternative to myelography for diagnosing spinal cord compression and is preferable as a first study because it is noninvasive and better tolerated.\r"

The safety of iohexol was assessed by monitoring adverse reactions and neurologic status and by measuring vital signs and serum laboratory values. The most frequent adverse reaction was headache (16 of 81 patients [19.7%]). Twelve patients complained of a headache on the day of the myelographic procedure, and four patients reported a headache 24 hours after the procedure. Nausea or vomiting occurred in four of 81 patients (4.9%) only on the day myelography was performed. No other neurologic abnormalities were found. Iohexol produced myelographic and CT studies of good to excellent quality in all patients. This study indicates that iohexol can be employed safely in lumbar myelography of adult outpatients.\r"

Sensitivity and specificity after 1 year of follow-up were 83.8% and 96.6%, respectively, with atypia reports being assumed positive. In patients strongly suspected of having cancer at mammography, the decision to perform biopsy must be independent of the cytologic report, as false-negative cytologic findings are expected. In patients with a low suspicion at mammography, abnormal cytologic findings were the determining factor for a request for biopsy of six cancers and of two benign lesions. Negative cytologic results contributed to the recommendation of follow-up of two lesions that turned out to be malignant. At the authors' institution, the benign-to-malignant biopsy ratio of nonpalpable lesions was greatly reduced after stereotaxic cytologic study became available; the rate of detection of subclinical cancer remained almost unaffected.\r"

Reaching seems to have evolved from the neural systems responsible for the active and precise positioning of the limb during locomotion; moreover, it seems to be organized in the spinal cord. The motor cortex and its corticospinal outflow are preferentially engaged when precise positioning of the limb is needed during locomotion and are also involved during reaching and active positioning of the hand near objects of interest. All of these motor activities require visuomotor coordination, and it is this coordination that could be achieved by the motor cortex and interconnected parietal and cerebellar areas.\r"

In contrast, neutrophils shed gp100MEL-14 from the cell surface within 4 minutes after activation with chemotactic factors or phorbol esters, releasing a 96-kilodalton fragment of the antigen into the supernatant. Immunohistology showed that gp100MEL-14 was downregulated on neutrophils that had extravasated into inflamed tissue. The gp100MEL-14 adhesion protein may participate in the binding of unactivated neutrophils to the endothelium; rapid shedding of gp100MEL-14 may prevent extravasation into and damage of normal tissues by activated neutrophils.\r"

The cytoplasmic signaling domain of Tar was replaced with the carboxyl portion of EnvZ, and the resulting chimeric receptor activated transcription of the ompC gene in response to aspartate.

In this \"dispersed polaron\" method the fluctuations of the protein and the electron carriers are projected as effective normal modes onto an appropriate reaction coordinate and used to evaluate the quantum mechanical rate constant. The simulations, based on the crystallographic structure of the reaction center from Rhodopseudomonas viridis, focus on electron transfer from a bacteriopheophytin to a quinone and the subsequent back-reaction. The rates of both of these reactions are almost independent of temperature or even increase with decreasing temperature. The simulations reproduce this unusual temperature dependence in a qualitative way, without the use of adjustable parameters for the protein's Franck-Condon factors. The observed dependence of the back-reaction on the free energy of the reaction also is reproduced, including the special behavior in the \"inverted region.\"\r"

Detailed analysis of the vascular anatomy of the abdominal wall has extended the uses of the transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap to major chest-wall reconstruction, both as a transposition flap and as a free-tissue transfer. Although the most direct pathway to the paraumbilical perforators that supply the large skin island of the flap is from the deep inferior epigastric artery, numerous collateral pathways exist from above that recruit blood from the intercostal vessels and the internal mammary artery even if it has been ligated or used for myocardial revascularization. Awareness of these collateral pathways and care to preserve them whenever possible, combined with the willingness to supplement blood flow with a microvascular anastomosis of the deep inferior epigastric vessels, allows the surgeon to use the rectus abdominis flap and its variations in almost any major chest-wall reconstruction (Fig. 11).\r"

However, some lesions are best treated with a multimodality approach including preoperative chemotherapy. Therefore, pretreatment tissue diagnosis is essential in planning. The biopsy should be done at the medical center where the definitive treatment will be undertaken, and frequently, a needle biopsy will be sufficient. Osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and other small-cell sarcomas are sensitive to chemotherapy, which should be given preoperatively, continued postoperatively, and modified according to the tumor response. Chondrosarcomas and most adult soft-tissue sarcomas are well controlled by primary excision and selective use of adjuvant irradiation. Better systemic and local therapy is needed for the recurrent soft-tissue sarcomas and the aggressive unclassified sarcomas. Chest-wall resection continues to play a primary role in the management of locally and regionally recurrent breast cancer but is best combined with systemic chemotherapy. Chest-wall resection can provide a long disease-free survival in patients with isolated metastases from sarcomas or carcinomas. In addition, significant palliation can be afforded patients with symptomatic chest-wall metastases and a shortened life expectancy.\r"

If cancer is not present, and a partial thickness of the chest remains, the authors prefer transposition of the greater omentum for repair. If cancer is present, the physiologic defect resulting from cancer resection and wound debridement is far more severe, and a muscle or musculocutaneous flap usually is appropriate. The pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, external oblique, rectus abdominis, and trapezius muscles have been utilized; the authors most often use the pectoralis or latissimus muscles.\r"

The flaps can be transferred on either thoracoacromial or internal mammary vascular pedicles and can be segmentally split to achieve defect closure while retaining portions of the muscle in situ to preserve donor motor function and surface form. The musculocutaneous paddles can be placed in a variety of locations and extended beyond the muscle borders to meet specific defect needs. This anatomic versatility gives pectoralis major muscle and musculocutaneous flaps a most useful role in the reconstruction of defects of the sternum and anterior mediastinum, defects of the ventral and lateral chest wall, and intrathoracic defects such as empyema cavities and bronchopleural fistula. A detailed knowledge of surgical anatomy is essential for optimal application of these flaps in the full spectrum of clinical needs.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional diagnostic tools have hitherto demonstrated low levels of specificity in establishing the diagnosis of appendicitis. We conducted a retrospective study of all patients who underwent abdominal or pelvic compression ultrasonography during a 15 month period based on variable clinical suspicion of appendicitis. Ultrasonographic interpretations were correlated with surgical and pathologic findings and clinical follow-up study. The initial 76 prospective ultrasonographic readings, interpreted by multiple examiners, were labeled group 1. The criterion used to diagnose appendicitis in this group was visualization of a noncompressible target-like structure with a hypoechoic wall greater than 2 millimeters in diameter. Ultrasonography was found to be 66.7 per cent sensitive, 90.6 per cent specific and 86.8 per cent accurate in the diagnosis of appendicitis, with a positive predictive value of 57.1 per cent and a negative predictive value of 93.5 per cent. We reassembled 70 of the original ultrasonographic examinations and retrospectively reanalyzed these studies (group 2), using the most recently published criterion, which requires a maximal appendiceal diameter of greater than 6 millimeters. Ultrasonography was shown to be 80.0 per cent sensitive, 95.0 per cent specific and 92.9 per cent accurate in diagnosing appendicitis, with a positive predictive value of 72.7 per cent and a negative predictive value of 96.6 per cent. Ultrasonographic examination provided additional findings, predominantly gynecologic or obstetric, in 52 per cent of the women, leading to an alternative diagnosis in one-third of these patients with complaints of abdominal pain. Ultrasonographic study provided additional findings in 12 per cent of the men, leading to alternative diagnoses in 12 per cent. Ultrasonographic results directly influenced clinical management in 18 per cent of the patients. As suggested in the most recent literature, appendiceal ultrasonographic examination is a reliable ancillary technique in diagnosing or excluding appendicitis. It is indicated only in patients with an atypical or equivocal presentation; those with clinical grounds do not require ancillary diagnostic aids and should proceed immediately to surgical intervention. The predominant role of ultrasonography in evaluating appendicitis is not as an independent diagnostic determinant. Instead, it is most useful as a means of improving decision making when considered in combination with a thorough history and physical examination in those patients who represent diagnostic dilemmas.\r"

No subcutaneous or subcuticular sutures were used. The average age of the patients was 53.5 years, and the average duration of follow-up study was 194 days. The rate of wound infection was 1.14 per cent, far lower than that in any other historical trails used for comparison. The over-all complication rate that was attributed solely to the method of skin closure was 4.57 per cent. This compares favorably with those in historical trials. Advantages of a taped skin closure are lower rates of infection and over-all morbidity, a lower cost and a reduction in time in the operating room when compared with conventional methods. Foreign body granulomas and cellulitis are avoided. Strangulation and necrosis of tissue are eliminated because of gentle handling of tissue. Needle puncture marks and suture canal scarring are eliminated. These factors lead to a better cosmetic result.\r"

Three important modifications in the operative procedures for the construction of the nipple valve were developed with significant improvements in late complication rates and end results. First is the use of Dacron (polyester fiber) fabric as a collar instead of Marlex mesh (polypropylene), which frequently causes erosion. The second is treatment of the mesentery using a CUSA (Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator) (Cavitron Co. Ltd.) instead of making Deaver's windows, thus preserving the blood supply to the nipple valves. Third is anchoring of the nipple valves to the anterior wall of the reservoir, preventing prolapse, the most frequent malfunction of the nipple valve. The incidence of malfunction of the nipple valve and the end results of this innovative urinary diversion using an internal reservoir were analyzed in relation to these modifications of the operative technique among 71 patients. To date, with an established mode of operation, the success rate is more than 95 per cent.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental transplantation of the liver is a complex procedure, and technical considerations can often complicate the interpretation of results from studies of hepatic preservation. Improvement in experimental transplantation techniques will decrease adverse effects of the procedure on laboratory animals and assist in the development of improved preservation techniques. The procedure should be designed to mimic the clinical situation. The technique described herein differs from previously described techniques in the operation upon the donor. The bile duct is preserved for anastomosis to the recipient bile duct. The liver is isolated on vascular pedicles, with a new approach to the infrahepatic inferior vena cava, which decreases blood loss. Subdiaphragmatic transection of the suprahepatic inferior vena cava ensures a short segment that cannot twist or telescope into the transplanted liver. The hepatic artery is dissected to the level of the aorta, in contrast with the aorta being used as a conduit. Nonheparinized blood is collected from the hepatic donor. During the operation upon the recipient, the approach to the infrahepatic vena cava minimizes blood loss. A new method of hepaticohepatic arterial anastomosis with preservation of the duodenal blood supply is described. A passive shunt for mesenteric blood flow is used. The bile duct is preserved and choledochocholedochal anastomosis is performed over a stent. The operating time of both harvesting and transplanting was considerably shorter compared with that of reports in the literature and with previous methods used in our laboratory. No dissection of the cold organ was done. There was no incidence of venous outflow obstruction, as previously described. With this technique, blood transfusion of only 1 unit (425 milliliters) resulted in an elevated hemoglobin concentration postoperatively. In 20 consecutive transplants, no failure occurred as a result of technical reasons. This new method appears to simplify the procedure, reduce operating time, is less stressful to the dogs and has produced results superior to those from our previous methods. This method would appear to be easily adaptable to other laboratories interested in hepatic transplantation.\r"

  ".U": "89388597\r", 
  ".W": "The marked decrease in the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach during the past four decades has been worldwide, with a few exceptions. Dietary deficiencies or carcinogenic substances appear to be the most important environmental factor in the genesis of carcinoma of the stomach. The risk of carcinoma of the stomach appears to be determined early in life. Based on the histologic features and the distinct differences in clinical behavior, adenocarcinoma of the stomach can be divided into the intestinal and diffuse types of lesions. In high risk populations, such as the Japanese, the intestinal type is found more frequently, while white Americans tend to have diffuse carcinomas. Premalignant gastric lesions, such as adenomatous polyps, are uncommon causes of carcinoma. The symptoms of carcinoma of the stomach are not specific and there is no satisfactory noninvasive diagnostic test to detect the carcinoma early. In Japan, mass screening, using air contrast radiography and endoscopy of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract with biopsies and cytologic sampling, leads to detection of early stages of carcinoma of the stomach in 40 per cent of patients. The postsurgical survival rate of these patients is significantly higher, compared with those who have advanced disease. Mass screening for carcinoma of the stomach would not be cost effective in North America. The only curative treatment for carcinoma of the stomach is resection, which is most successful in early stages of carcinomas of the stomach. Radical subtotal gastrectomy is the operation of choice for curative treatment of carcinomas of the body and antrum of the stomach. In Japan, a more extensive lymphadenectomy has improved the five year survival rate. Operations for carcinoma of the cardia are invariably palliative. Palliative resection of an incurable carcinoma of the stomach has been shown to be more worthwhile than a bypass procedure. Adjuvant chemotherapy seems to have improved the unsatisfactory results of radical resection in the treatment of locally advanced carcinoma in Japan, a finding that has not been confirmed in the United States or Europe. The use of intraoperative electron beam radiation to improve the surgical outcome of carcinoma of the stomach is being investigated.\r"

  ".W": "The circumstances surrounding aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were investigated in a group of 500 consecutive patients admitted to a neurosurgical center. Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred during stressful events in 42.8% of the patients, during nonstrenuous activities in 34.4%, and during rest or sleep in 11.8%. The activities or events preceding subarachnoid hemorrhage were not known in the remaining 11.0%. Men were more likely to have suffered their hemorrhage during stressful events than women (54.1% versus 36.6%; p less than 0.00025). Only 30.1% of aneurysms arising from the internal carotid artery ruptured during stressful events compared with 48.1% of aneurysms at other locations (p less than 0.005). Physiological responses to the various activities and events are discussed as they may relate to mechanisms underlying aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Two important factors in the precipitation of aneurysmal rupture are increased arterial blood pressure and decreased cerebrospinal fluid pressure around the aneurysm. These factors result in a high transmural pressure and concomitant wall stress. Physical exertion, activities involving the Valsalva maneuver, and emotional strain are associated with an increase in blood pressure and frequently preceded subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fluctuations in cerebrospinal fluid pressure around the aneurysm mainly occur during Valsalva's maneuver and postural changes.\r"

Impedance plethysmography was used to detect deep vein thrombosis both preoperatively and postoperatively. Two patients, one from each group, developed thromboembolic complications postoperatively. Impedance plethysmography showed false-positive findings in two additional patients. There were no deaths. The data suggest that either form of mechanical prophylaxis is effective against the development of deep vein thrombosis in this high-risk patient population.\r"

  ".W": "Most currently available infant formulas have a protein concentration that provides intakes of nutritionally available protein that markedly exceed the requirements and also the protein intakes from human milk in breast-fed infants. Exclusively breast-fed infants have protein intakes of about 2 gm/kg/day during the first month of life and thereafter the intake decreases to about 1 gm/kg/day between the fourth and the sixth month. The amino acid composition of the nutritionally available proteins from human milk also differ significantly from those found in formulas based on bovine milk proteins. If the purpose is to produce human milk substitutes with a protein amino acid pattern similar to that of human milk and to produce a plasma amino acid profile and other metabolic indices of protein metabolism similar to that found in breast-fed infants, then the quantity of protein in formulas must be decreased, and furthermore the quality of the milk proteins must be modified and/or the whey-to-casein ratio changed. Preterm infants with a birth weight less than 1,500 gm grow at intrauterine rates (approximately 30 gm/day) on human milk protein intakes of 3 gm/kg/day when the caloric intake is 120 kcal/kg/day and mineral intakes adequate. At this protein intake, indices of protein metabolism and plasma amino acid profiles are similar to those found in breast-fed term infants. If currently available formula proteins are administered at similar intakes, the plasma amino acid profile of the infants will differ from that found in human milk-fed infants although growth rates and other metabolic responses are similar. This suggests that protein quality must be modified in formulas for VLBW infants. Urine area and urine amino acid excretion correlates directly with protein intake greater than 3.0 gm/kg/day in VLBW infants. By monitoring these metabolites in the urine, it may be possible in the future to adjust protein intakes to meet individual differences in requirements in VLBW infants.\r"

The precise roles of the bacteria, the human host, and the environment and their interrelationships require more study. Determining their roles and defining the pathogenesis can have important practical application. If one could identify a susceptible population, if one could identify the serotypes and/or strains of group A streptococci that are more dangerous (rheumatogenic) and if one could identify the reason for an abnormal immune response, vaccines might be made with specific protective components of the group A streptococci and administered only to known susceptible individuals. Providing optimal public health programs to control a disease that still is a major problem in a large segment of the world's population is the goal. It is quite clear from the resurgence of acute rheumatic fever in the United States in the mid-1980s that antibiotics alone are not the answer to rheumatic fever control. If antibiotics are not completely effective in a country such as the United States, they cannot be expected to be effective in many of the developing countries of the world where primary health care delivery is even more difficult. Intensified efforts to understand the pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for the development of rheumatic fever should be undertaken. In the meantime, the preventive methods that are available should be vigorously applied.\r"

However, conventional cholesterol-lowering drugs are either ineffective or contraindicated for use in transplant recipients. The presence of type II hyperlipidemia was identified in 11 cardiac transplant recipients during a mean follow-up period of 15 months (range 3 to 41) after transplantation. Lovastatin, at an initial dosage of 20 mg/day, was administered for a period of 1 year. The maximal dosage of lovastatin was 60 mg/day. All patients received maintenance dosages of immunosuppressive agents, including cyclosporine-A, prednisone and, in some instances, azathioprine. Lipid profiles, hepatic transaminases, serum creatinine, creatine kinase and cyclosporine-A serum trough levels were measured quarterly. Total cholesterol decreased by 27% (354 +/- 50 vs 258 +/- 36 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) after 3 months and remained stable thereafter. Similarly, low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 34% (221 +/- 51 vs 146 +/- 40 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) after 3 months and remained constant. Triglycerides, high density lipoprotein, hepatic transaminases, creatinine, creatine kinase and trough cyclosporine-A levels remained stable during the 1-year follow-up period. Lovastatin was uniformly well tolerated in this study group. When given in modest dosages, lovastatin appears to be a safe, effective and well-tolerated therapy for hypercholesterolemia in cardiac transplant recipients.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that use of beta blockers may not be safe after cardiac transplantation because the denervated hearts may be largely dependent on circulating catecholamines to increase cardiac output. Therefore, the effects of intravenous propranolol were studied during maximal treadmill exercise in 7 patients with heterotopic and 6 with orthotopic cardiac transplantations. An average decrease of about 15% in exercise duration (p less than 0.001), a 34% reduction in systolic blood pressure increase (p less than 0.05) and a 40% attenuation in heart rate increase (p less than 0.001) were observed after beta blockade. In patients with heterotopic transplantation, beta blockade produced similar effects on heart rate in the denervated donor hearts and the innervated recipient hearts during and after mild exercise. During peak exercise, beta blockade attenuated the rate to a greater extent in the donor hearts. Although the denervated donor heart is more sensitive to beta blockade than the innervated recipient heart during exercise, no adverse effects were observed. Beta-blocker therapy should be considered for cardiac transplant patients if longer-term studies confirm their safe use in these patients.\r"

Accordingly, 40 patients were studied by metabolic exercise testing early (1 to 3 months) and late (6 to 12 months) after cardiac transplantation. Various clinical parameters, including congestive heart failure class, length of hospital stay, age, cold ischemic time and histologic evidence of rejection were correlated with exercise capacity after transplantation. As expected, peak exercise capacity correlated inversely with both age and length of hospital stay. There was no correlation with preoperative congestive heart failure class or heart rate at rest. Interestingly, there was a statistically significant correlation between cold ischemic time and exercise capacity after transplantation. In addition, increased episodes of rejection during the first 6 months after transplantation resulted in statistically lower exercise capacity at 6 to 12 months after the operation. Thus, ischemic damage during transport of the donor organs and subclinical damage during early rejection may affect clinical status after heart transplantation and may only be apparent during increased physical demand such as exercise.\r"

The treatment of patients with coronary artery disease with agents such as calcium channel blockers has been directed at reducing ischemia by restoring the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, which ultimately serves to protect against myocardial dysfunction. Once ischemia has occurred, calcium channel blockers may protect myocardial cellular integrity and function. By reducing intracellular calcium overload during ischemia, mitochondrial function is preserved and adenosine triphosphate stores are maintained. Numerous in vitro and isolated heart preparations have shown that ischemia in the presence of calcium blockade is associated with less cellular dysfunction than in the situation of ischemia in the absence of calcium channel blockade.\r"

  ".W": "The principal common pathway for myocardial ischemia is an oxygen supply-demand imbalance; more recently, greater emphasis has been placed on limitations of myocardial blood supply, as well as excessive myocardial oxygen demand. Myocardial ischemia is a metabolic event resulting from inadequate oxygen delivery to local tissues. The physiologic effects of ischemia are observed through abnormalities in left ventricular function, electrocardiographic changes, and often, by angina pectoris. Prognostic and therapeutic outcomes are significantly related to the pathophysiology of the underlying coronary lesion. Because myocardial ischemia often occurs without symptoms, clinical distinctions based on angina stability may more appropriately be represented by stable or unstable ischemic syndromes that incorporate silent ischemia. Stable ischemic syndromes occur secondary to coronary plaques, whereas unstable syndromes are the result of active lesions caused by plaque rupture with local thrombus and vasoreactivity that produce intermittent critical decreases in coronary supply. The prognosis of patients with stable ischemia is related to the extent of myocardium at jeopardy and overall left ventricular function. In contrast, unstable syndromes are associated with a worse short-term prognosis, which may be predictable by the presence of silent ischemia or left ventricular dysfunction or both. Therapeutic decisions based on an improved pathophysiologic understanding of ischemic mechanisms as well as the physiologic impact of therapy on cardiac function can enhance efficacy while avoiding adverse effects. Calcium channel blockers appear to afford certain advantages in the treatment of myocardial ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With the gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation, constant effective drug levels of nifedipine are delivered for a full 24-hour period. When nifedipine GITS 30, 60 or 90 mg was administered once daily to patients with stable angina pectoris taking beta blockers, clinical effectiveness was demonstrated both by an increase in time to angina and by exercise time compared with placebo. Improvement was noted to be more significant with the higher doses of nifedipine administered once daily. This study indicates that nifedipine GITS provides additional antianginal protection in patients with exercise-induced angina secondary to coronary artery disease who are receiving a fixed dose of beta blocker.\r"

Studies on living vascular smooth muscle cells using the calcium indicator aequorin have revealed that the relation between [Ca2+]i and contraction of the vascular smooth muscle cell is complex. More than 1 intracellular kinase may be involved, leading to the coexistence of multiple excitation-contraction coupling pathways. However, it appears that all of these pathways may be calcium-dependent. It is not yet known whether the cause of human essential hypertension involves an elevated [Ca2+]i in the vascular smooth muscle cell. However, evidence is presented supporting the concept that a decreased [Ca2+]i in the hypertensive smooth muscle cell will lead to a decrease in vascular tone and total peripheral resistance, and possibly also antagonize the growth response of the vascular smooth muscle cell associated with the secondary effects of hypertension.\r"

Although there is a controversy about whether diuretics have an additive effect on blood pressure in patients already taking nifedipine, it would appear that the blood pressure-lowering effect of thiazide is blunted. Studies have shown that a high sodium intake may enhance the acute blood pressure-lowering effect of nifedipine. Nifedipine does cause a long-term reduction in sodium balance.\r"

The assistance of Scotland Yard was obtained. Sir Bernard Spilsbury's autopsy revealed that Messiter had died from several severe blunt force craniocerebral injuries, the murder weapon apparently being a blood-encrusted hammer found nearby. Suspicion immediately centered on William Podmore, alias William Thomas, who had been employed by Messiter for 3 days in late October 1928, immediately prior to Messiter's being declared missing. Podmore, who was wanted for fraud and robbery elsewhere in England, was questioned and told a self-serving story. Meanwhile, it had been suspected that he had reported to Messiter sales of oil to fictitious customers, collecting commissions on same, and this was eventually reinforced by the finding of traces of writing in a receipt book. Two fellow prisoners of Podmore stated that he had confessed in their presence. Almost 14 months after the murder, Podmore was charged with it. He was later convicted, and was hanged after some public outcry against the verdict.\r"

  ".W": "The endothelium can release potent vasodilator substances, in particular prostacyclin and endothelium-derived relaxing factor. The triggers for the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor include increases in levels of shear stress, neurotransmitters, autacoids, platelet products, and hormones. The endothelium-dependent response to catecholamines involves stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors on the endothelial cells. Indeed, in a number of blood vessels, selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonists cause endothelium-dependent relaxations. These are seen most typically in blood vessels with long-term exposure to high flows and high partial pressures of oxygen. In addition to the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, alpha 2-adrenergic agonists can stimulate postjunctional (postsynaptic) alpha 2-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscles. These receptors, which are more abundant in hypertensive blood vessels, activate the contractile process. However, the alpha 2-adrenergic vasoconstrictors act as partial agonists (with a limited receptor reserve) and hence their vasoconstrictor response is very sensitive to functional antagonists such as endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Thus, the presence of endothelial cells can blunt the vasoconstrictor response to these substances not only because of an augmented release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor but also because the vasoconstriction that they induce is particularly susceptible to the inhibitory effect of the factor.\r"

  ".W": "The most usual hypothesis to explain the central hypotensive effect of clonidine-like substances was to admit that these drugs stimulated alpha 2-adrenoceptors within the brainstem. Now it has been demonstrated that neither the endogenous ligand to the alpha-adrenoceptors, noradrenaline, nor any other catecholamine or phenylethylamine was hypotensive in the medullary nucleus reticularis lateralis, where all imidazolines proved to be such. Recently, a membrane receptor population sensitive to clonidine and insensitive to catecholamines was described within the nucleus reticularis lateralis; this subgroup of receptors represented 20 to 30 percent of the [3H]clonidine binding sites in the bovine nucleus reticularis lateralis and 100 percent within the human nucleus reticularis lateralis region. Thus, the existence of such imidazoline specific receptors was clearly established and the endogenous ligand for those receptors, which is neither a catecholamine nor likely a peptide, is under processing for purification. Therefore, it appeared that the hypotensive effect of substances with an imidazoline or imidazoline-like structure might be due to their action within medullary receptors specific for this endogenous ligand temporarily named \"clonidine displacing substance.\" Rilmenidine, structurally close to imidazolines, also interfered with these receptors. The central component of its hypotensive effect was recently confirmed in rabbits, where its central cardiovascular effects were antagonized by \"the clonidine displacing substance.\" Although exhibiting a lower affinity than the reference substance for these receptors, rilmenidine might have a higher selectivity, thus explaining its restricted side effects. A structure-activity study with this molecule would bring a confirmation to these first observations.\r"

  ".U": "89390444\r", 
  ".W": "The antihypertensive properties of rilmenidine, an oxazoline derivative, have been demonstrated in several experimental models of hypertension after short- or long-term administration. In pentobarbitone-anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats, intravenous rilmenidine (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced blood pressure and heart rate. Upon long-term subcutaneous infusion (5 to 15 mg/kg per day) in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, rilmenidine induced a dose-dependent decrease in both cardiovascular parameters. In conscious sino-aortic denervated dogs, rilmenidine (1 mg/kg orally for two weeks) significantly reduced blood pressure and heart rate. The hypotensive action of rilmenidine is mediated through a reduction in peripheral sympathetic tone, resulting from a central action and possibly a peripheral action. Rilmenidine also decreases catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla which might contribute to the antihypertensive effect. Therefore, rilmenidine acts similarly to clonidine and related compounds in order to lower blood pressure, i.e., reduction of sympathetic tone. Nevertheless, although it binds to alpha 2-adrenoceptors, rilmenidine did not cause sedation in animal models: at doses up to 10 mg/kg in mice and rats, it did not prolong the barbiturate-induced sleeping time and did not modify the spontaneous locomotor activity in rats at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg. These results demonstrate a dissociation between sedative and antihypertensive effects of rilmenidine. Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain why this drug is almost devoid of sedative activity in animal experimental models: (1) unknown properties counteracting the alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated sedation; (2) a preferential action at the peripheral level; (3) central receptors involved in sedation and hypotension may be different. The intimate mechanism underlying the hypotensive effects of rilmenidine is currently under investigation. The evidence for rilmenidine binding on central sites named \"imidazoline sites\" involved in blood pressure regulation could possibly provide further insight into its mechanism of action and explain the duality of its effects.\r"

Pharmacologic and clinical data concerning efficacy and acceptability of rilmenidine, its effects on physiologic functions, and hypothesis of mechanism of action are described in this report.

In this respect, several findings resulting from fundamental pharmacology, clinical pharmacology, and therapeutics differentiate rilmenidine from clonidine and related drugs. Hypotheses to explain the results observed with rilmenidine involve unknown properties that could counteract with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated sedation, respective contribution of central and peripheral components to the activity of rilmenidine, and possible contribution of imidazoline receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The respective prevalence of hypertension and asthma is sufficient for their combined existence to be far from rare. The effects of certain antihypertensive drugs, e.g., alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, on the bronchi may be either harmful or beneficial. When inhaled, alpha 2-agonists reduce the immediate bronchial response to allergens, whereas when ingested they aggravate the bronchial response to histamine and all the more so when their effect on the central nervous system is greater. Therefore, there has been much interest in agents such as the new oxazoline derivative, rilmenidine, which has less central effects than clonidine, an imidazoline compound of reference. Calcium antagonists inhibit smooth muscle contraction and release of mast cell inflammatory mediators. In asthmatic subjects, their short-term administration leads to a modest improvement in spontaneous bronchial obstruction, has only a partial protective action against various nonspecific or allergenic stimuli, and slightly reinforces the beneficial effect of beta 2-agonists. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists aggravate bronchial obstruction and nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity in asthmatic subjects. These harmful effects are dose-dependent, have even been reported after the administration of eyedrops, and are common to all beta-blockers. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increase bronchial hyperreactivity in patients who develop cough during treatment and may, in certain cases, worsen or even induce asthma, probably by opposing inactivation by hydrolysis of tachykinins and of bradykinins.\r"

  ".W": "Partial alpha 2-agonists are thought to lower blood pressure principally by stimulation of postsynaptic central nervous system alpha 2-adrenoceptors. It is possible for some to have also a peripheral action, either by acting on the inhibitory presynaptic or as an antagonist at the postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor. In order to assess these other actions, indices are required for these receptors. Plasma growth hormone is used for the central nervous system and skin blood flow for peripheral postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Plasma insulin is also an index for the latter, but a double-site assay is required to detect decreases within the fasting range. Plasma noradrenaline reflects both central nervous system and peripheral modulation of sympathetic nerve activity, so that \"dynamic\" tests (described next) are required to dissect these two control mechanisms. Selective peripheral alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation or blockade may be attractive for various therapeutic applications such as hypertension, diabetes, and Raynaud's phenomenon. The balance of opposing pre- and postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor effects will be important and this may require more dynamic tests than already mentioned, such as comparing the effect of alpha-methylnoradrenaline on plasma noradrenaline (presynaptic effect) and skin blood flow (postsynaptic effect) in the presence and absence of the partial alpha 2-agonist or antagonist under investigation. Since alpha-methylnoradrenaline does not penetrate the central nervous system, any blockade of its action by a drug must be peripherally mediated. Examples of all these indices, investigations, and drugs are presented.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, the possible effects of rilmenidine on vigilance are evaluated. Sedation is the most disturbing side effect of alpha 2-agonists, especially during the first weeks of treatment. The level of vigilance was first determined by assessing drowsiness using visual analogue scales and/or by several psychometric tests in four pharmacoclinical studies in healthy subjects or in hypertensive patients: three studies with single administration of rilmenidine (0.5 to 3.0 mg) and one study with repeated administration for three days. These studies were double-blind, Latin-square designed, and controlled versus placebo (in all studies) and versus clonidine (in three studies). Analysis of these results illustrated that after short-term and repeated administration: (1) the effects on vigilance observed with rilmenidine 1 mg did not differ statistically from data observed with placebo; and (2) sedative effects observed with clonidine were significantly greater than with rilmenidine, at equihypotensive doses. Daytime drowsiness was systematically assessed and graded by inciting questioning at each visit in five clinical studies. Ambulatory hypertensive patients were treated with rilmenidine (1 mg per day or 1 mg twice a day). These studies were controlled versus placebo (one study for two weeks, 120 patients; and one study for one month, 126 patients), hydrochlorothiazide (six weeks, 56 patients), clonidine (six weeks, 333 patients), and methyldopa (three months, 157 patients). The results showed that: (1) drowsiness observed with rilmenidine did not differ statistically from that observed with placebo or diuretic; and (2) drowsiness occurred less frequently with rilmenidine than with reference alpha 2-agonists at equihypotensive doses. In conclusion, these results confirm in current clinical use the dissociation already observed in laboratory animals between the antihypertensive effects and the sedative effects and may distinguish rilmenidine among alpha 2-agonists.\r"

Ultrasonographic examination alone detected all 26 fetal abnormalities (11 cases of anencephaly, 10 cases of open spina bifida, and five other anomalies). Twenty-eight patients declined amniocentesis; all had normal pregnancy outcomes. Of the 167 patients with apparently normal fetal anatomy by sonography, seven had elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels but no acetylcholinesterase in the amniotic fluid. Six of these pregnancies resulted in normal infants; one infant had congenital nephrosis. The remaining 160 patients had normal sonograms with normal amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein levels and no fetal malformations at delivery. Although these results suggest that targeted ultrasonography by experienced personnel is a reasonable alternative to amniocentesis in evaluations for neural tube defects, the availability, cost-effectiveness, and diagnostic accuracy of this approach must be well documented in large prospective studies.\r"

Operative time was longer for the stapled suture group for primary cesarean sections, but was unchanged for repeat procedures. Excellent hemostasis of the uterine incision was achieved even when varicose sinusoidal veins were present. Significant reductions of hemoglobin deficits from 2.16 to 1.31 gm/dl, postoperative anemia from 29% to 6.4%, and endometritis from 22.5% to 6.4% occurred respectively in nonstapled and stapled groups. A reduced hospital stay, shortened by 2.1 days, saved each patient +F42950. Blood loss estimates by surgeons or anesthetists were often at variance.

The subjects with one abnormal test result were randomized into treated (group 1) and untreated groups (group II). Group 1 subjects were treated with a strict diabetic protocol to maintain tight glycemic control by means of diet and insulin therapy. Group 2 subjects tested their capillary blood glucose for a baseline period. The study revealed that the level of glycemic control was similar before initiation of therapy (mean capillary blood glucose 118 +/- 14 vs. 119 +/- 15 mg/dl, p = NS) for groups 1 and 2, respectively. There was a significant difference in mean capillary blood glucose (95 +/- 10 vs. 119 +/- 15 mg/dl, p less than 0.0001), preprandial, and postprandial determinations between the treated and untreated groups. The overall incidence of neonatal metabolic complications (4% vs. 14%, p less than 0.05) and large infants (6% vs. 24%, p less than 0.03) was significantly lower in the treated group. Comparison between the control (normal oral glucose tolerance test) and the untreated groups showed a significantly higher incidence of large infants and metabolic complications. No difference was found between the normal and treated groups. Thus we conclude that treatment of individuals with one abnormal oral glucose tolerance test value will result in significant reduction in adverse outcome in pregnancy.\r"

Recently exogenous surfactant replacement therapy has been used to prevent or treat respiratory distress syndrome. As part of a multicenter, preventive trial between February 1986 and December 1988 using calf-lung surfactant extract, we treated 147 infants with single dose calf-lung surfactant extract. We analyzed this experience to evaluate the possibility that antenatal steroids may be additive (with calf-lung surfactant extract) in reducing both the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome. Although a reduction in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was observed among the 33 neonates exposed to antenatal dexamethasone when compared with the 114 infants given calf-lung surfactant extract alone, the difference was not significant (37.7% vs. 24.2% p = 0.15). However, comparison of neonatal subsets previously shown to benefit most from steroid use revealed an additive effect between calf-lung surfactant extract and dexamethasone in reducing both the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome. Of the 99 singleton pregnancies, only 2 of 16 infants treated with calf-lung surfactant extract and dexamethasone developed respiratory distress syndrome, compared with the 33 of 83 calf-lung surfactant extract cases (p less than 0.05). A similar reduction was observed in infants between 28 and 32 weeks' gestation (calf-lung surfactant extract, 21 of 79 vs. calf-lung surfactant extract and dexamethasone, 0 of 24; p less than 0.05). A reduction in disease severity was observed in male offspring (moderate or severe respiratory distress syndrome only; 22 of 63 vs. 2 of 22; p less than 0.05). Potential confounding variables (e.g., gestational age at birth, birth weight, exposure to tocolytics before delivery, fetal pH at birth) were similar in all comparisons. We conclude that an additive effect between dexamethasone and calf-lung surfactant extract is observed in selected cases. It may therefore be appropriate to maximize antenatal steroid use in centers where exogenous surfactant is available.\r"

State organization was evaluated as suspect or abnormal for 16 of the 20 exposed newborns. Disorganized behavioral state in the fetus successfully predicted abnormal newborn behavior. These findings support the concepts that cocaine exposure disrupts central nervous system development and that fetal assessment of state is predictive of neonatal outcome.\r"

Situations in which the paternal chromosomes cannot be analyzed (e.g., artificial insemination, nonpaternity, deceased or otherwise unavailable father) are only \"possibly\" de novo. In our series of 23,495 prenatal diagnoses we unexpectedly found 67 balanced translocations. Of these, 26 were Robertsonian and 41 were reciprocal. A total of 45 (67%) of these translocations were inherited, and 19 (28%) were apparently de novo. Inherited translocations were maternal in 25 cases (55%) and paternal in 20 cases (45%). Follow-up was available in 87% overall, and revealed abnormal outcomes in 2/15 de novo cases, and 2/38 inherited cases. We suggest that 10% may be a reasonable estimate of risk for de novo translocations found at prenatal diagnosis. Given the observed distributions of inherited cases, a lower risk of abnormal outcome should be counseled in \"possibly\" de novo cases.\r"

In 50% of the procedures, the placenta was anterior and punctured. For all patients, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels rose 70.8% +/- 28%. The magnitude of the rise was unrelated to the number of attempts necessary, gestational age, or the initial maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels concentration. The location of the placenta was the sole identified variable related to the rise. A total of 44% of the patients had a significant increase in maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level when the placenta was anterior. In contrast, only 4% of the patients had a significant rise in maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level when the placenta was other than anterior. There was no difference in the frequency of a significant rise in maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level concentration between the patients who underwent cordocentesis and those who underwent intravascular transfusion. On the basis of these findings, we recommend that when maternal isoimmunization is a potential concern and the placenta is anterior, the umbilical cord should be approached either through a window or laterally from the placenta.\r"

Fetuses with an elevated umbilical venous pressure had disorders consistent with either hepatomegaly or congestive heart failure. Umbilical venous pressure was significantly increased before treatment in two fetuses with immune hydrops; it rapidly declined with treatment. Neither gestational age nor umbilical venous pressure was significantly different in the groups that received and did not receive pancuronium. There was a strong relationship between amniotic fluid pressure and gestational age in normal pregnancy (r = 0.54, p less than 0.0001). Women with hydramnios had amniotic fluid pressures greater than control subjects (p = 0.0007). This investigation documents normal human amniotic fluid and fetal umbilical venous pressures. These measurements are altered by disease and may prove to be of diagnostic and therapeutic value in the future.\r"

For each model, R2 approached 1.0. The generated equations were tested on 167 nonmodel cases. Among the three best equations, 65% to 67% of estimates were within 100 mg/kg birth weight. The mean absolute error ranged from 86 to 91 gm/kg. With a mean lapse time of 16.8 +/- 11 days, the accuracy of birth weight estimates equaled or exceeded that reported for existing static formulas. The accuracy of the estimates was maintained across the entire range of lapse times and birth weights observed. In intrapartum situations when ultrasonography is unavailable or technically difficult, birth weight can be estimated from remote ultrasound parameters.\r"

A total of 317 consecutive patients with well-dated pregnancies who were seen because of fetal surveillance at greater than 41 weeks' gestation had an estimation of the fetal weight based on femur length and abdominal circumference at the initial visit. The incidence of macrosomia at 41 weeks' gestation was 25.5%. There was a higher incidence of cesarean section because of arrest and protraction disorders in the postdate pregnancies in which the infant was macrosomic (22%) versus those in which the infant was not macrosomic (10%, p less than 0.01). In a control group of 100 consecutive women delivered between 38 and 40 weeks' gestation, the incidence of macrosomia was 4%, significantly lower than the rate in the postdate patients (p less than 0.01). Incidence of cesarean section because of arrest and protraction disorders was significantly lower in this group (6%, p less than 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of an estimated fetal weight greater than 4000 gm to predict a birth weight greater than 4000 gm were 60.5% and 90.7%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 70% and a negative predictive value of 87%. We conclude that routine ultrasonographic screening for macrosomia may be a valuable adjunct to current fetal surveillance protocols used in the postdate pregnancy.\r"

The following cutoff values were used to indicate abnormal test results: delta biparietal diameter greater than 6 mm, delta abdominal circumference greater than 20 mm, delta femur length greater than 5 mm, delta estimated fetal weight greater than 15%, and delta systolic/diastolic ratio greater than 15%. Discordancy was identified when the birth weight difference exceeded 15%. The study population consisted of 58 consecutively evaluated third-trimester twin gestations. Eighteen sets of twins were discordant. None of these tests was uniformally successful in identifying twin discordancy; in three instances, all test results were normal. The diagnostic accuracy provided by ultrasonography was not significantly different from that provided by Doppler velocimetry. Overall the best predictor appeared to be the presence of either delta systolic/diastolic ratio greater than 15% or delta estimated fetal weights greater than 15%, which correctly identified 14 of the 18 discordant twins and misclassified only five of the 40 concordant pairs. This combination also had the highest positive and negative predictive values (73% and 90%, respectively).\r"

We evaluated 590 patients studies performed at 2-week intervals from 14 to 42 weeks' gestation on patients without medical or pregnancy complications. Readings were obtained during fetal quiet times (no fetal breathing or movements). Values for A (systolic) and B (diastolic) pressures were plotted as Pourcelot (A - B/A) and A/B ratios. Mean, SD, and 95% confidence limits were derived, and the skewness, kurtosis, and regression correlations were calculated. No diastolic flow was found in any pregnancy greater than 15 weeks' gestation (n = 25) or in 50% of the gestations between 15 to 17 weeks (n = 25). When diastolic pressure equals zero, the Pourcelot ratio value equals one and the A/B ratio approaches infinity and loses meaning. Recent work by Thompson et al. suggests that the Pourcelot ratio fits a normal distribution from 20 to 40 weeks' gestation and that the A/B ratio (which does not fit a normal curve) may be transformed to a normal distribution by conversion of the A/B ratio to 1/1 - Pourcelot ratio. Our data supports the normality of both indices from 18 to 42 weeks' gestation, but these assumptions are not applicable as the Pourcelot ratio approaches one or as the A/B ratio approaches infinity. Knowledge of normal umbilical flow ratios at gestational ages from 18 weeks may allow early detection and directed management of high-risk pregnancies.\r"

Growth-retarded fetuses had significantly lower PO2 levels in the umbilical artery at birth (3 mm Hg less) than did healthy fetuses (p less than 0.05), but without metabolic acidosis. There was a larger proportion of small amplitude (less than 10 beats/min) and a smaller proportion of large amplitude (greater than 20 beats/min) fetal heart rate accelerations in the small-for-gestational-age fetuses than in the fetuses of normal growth. Although the number of accelerations was significantly reduced (50% less) in growth-retarded fetuses compared with healthy fetuses, there was no significant difference in the mean basal fetal heart rate and the mean number of decelerations between the two groups. Currently used definition of an acceleration as greater than or equal to 15 beats/min for greater than or equal to 15 seconds was applicable only in fetuses of normal growth. We hypothesized that a decrease in absolute acceleration frequency might be a useful index to detect the chronically hypoxemic fetus before severe metabolic acidosis and irreversible damage occurred.\r"

  ".W": "The inhibition of labor subsequent to premature rupture of the membranes remains controversial. To evaluate the possibility that diminished amniotic fluid volume impacts on the latent period in patients receiving tocolytic therapy after premature rupture of the membranes, we reviewed our recent clinical experience with premature rupture of the membranes and the use of tocolytic agents. Between January 1985 and June 1988, 70 singleton pregnancies with premature rupture of the membranes between 25 and 34 weeks of gestation without prior tocolytic therapy were included. Ritodrine (n = 22), magnesium sulfate (n = 37), or both agents (n = 11) were administered and followed by oral terbutaline if tocolysis was achieved. Ultrasonographic examination was performed after admission and patients were grouped on the basis of estimates of residual amniotic fluid volume. Fourteen patients had adequate fluid volume; 20 had diminished fluid volume, and 36 had oligohydramnios. Patients with adequate fluid volume had a significantly longer interval between tocolytic therapy and delivery when compared with the other two categories (analysis of variance, p less than 0.001), and proportionately more patients remained undelivered for greater than 1 week (adequate 8 of 14 vs. diminished 3 of 20 and oligohydramnios 3 of 36; p less than 0.001). In the 18 patients with premature rupture of the membranes before 30 weeks' gestation, adequate fluid volume was associated with the longest latent period (adequate 14.0 days; diminished 12.6 days, and oligohydramnios 2.8 days; analysis of variance, p less than 0.05). We conclude that tocolytic therapy is of little benefit in the presence of oligohydramnios. If additional prospective studies of tocolytic efficacy in pregnancies complicated by premature rupture of the membranes are undertaken, inclusion of residual amniotic fluid volume as an independent variable before randomization should be considered.\r"

Endotoxin was detected with the limulus amebocyte lysate assay in 4.9% (13/264) of patients with preterm labor. All patients with endotoxin in the amniotic fluid delivered preterm neonates.

On day 12 of gestation, rats were injected intraperitoneally with saline, LPS, native or heat-inactivated (HI) rHIL 1 alpha, or rH-TNF alpha. Seven days later, grossly abnormal implantation sites and fetal demise were observed in rats injected with rHIL-1, rHTNF, or LPS but not in those injected with saline or HI-cytokines. Necrosis of placental, decidual, and fetal tissues was observed in cytokine-treated animals. The necrosis was more severe in LPS-treated rats, in which no fetal remains were identifiable.

  ".W": "Adult cats determined by clinical laboratory evaluations to be normal, impaired glucose tolerant, or overtly diabetic were used to explore prospectively the relationships among pancreatic beta cell islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) immunoreactivity, islet amyloid (IA) deposition, and diabetogenesis. IAPP-derived IA was found in 11 of 14 (79%) diabetic cats, in four of nine (44%) impaired glucose tolerant cats, and in two of eight (25%) normal adult cats. The presence of IA even in very small amounts, therefore, predicts a very high probability (88%) that an animal has either impaired glucose tolerance or overt DM. Although all overtly diabetic cats had a marked decrease or absence of beta cell IAPP immunoreactivity, six of six cats with impaired glucose tolerance retained IAPP immunoreactivity with 1:15,000 dilutions of antisynthetic IAPP 7-17, whereas only one of seven normal cats had IAPP immunoreactivity beyond 1:10,000 dilutions. These findings suggest that increased IAPP production preceding the development of overt DM is linked to the progressive formation of insoluble IA deposits that are apparent in most overtly diabetic individuals. Of most importance, in that IAPP has been reported to inhibit both basal and insulin-stimulated rates of glycogen synthesis, is the possibility that increased production and release of IAPP by pancreatic beta cells plays a key role in the development of the insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance, both of which occur in Type 2 DM.\r"

One of the earliest morphologic changes observed in the vasculature of the SHR is the development of a thickened subendothelial space (SES). Neither the biochemical composition nor the anatomic distribution of this early subendothelial deposit has been definitively determined. By combining morphologic, immunologic, and molecular biological approaches, it was demonstrated that by 15 weeks the acellular subendothelial thickening in the vasculature of the SHR results at least in part from the increased synthesis and deposition of basement membrane macromolecules. Moreover, rather than being manifest systemically, this early connective tissue lesion appears to be localized primarily to the aorta and major branches off the aortic arch.\r"

  ".W": "Diffuse senile plaques are characterized by the presence of beta protein (beta P), also called A4 protein, in a dispersed form and the apparent lack of associated dystrophic neurites or reactive glial cells. They are the most common type of senile plaque found in the cerebral cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Down's syndrome (DS), and normal aging. Here is reported the frequent presence of diffuse senile plaques in the molecular layer of cerebellar cortex in AD. Typical neuritic plaques were never detected in this location, making the cerebellar molecular cortex a useful site for the study of diffuse plaques because diffuse plaques in the cerebral cortex are intermingled with neuritic plaques. Diffuse cerebellar plaques were detected by modified Bielschowsky silver stain in 47 of 100 cases of clinically and pathologically diagnosed AD and in none of 40 aged demented and nondemented controls. They were immunolabeled by antibodies to purified AD meningeal or cortical beta P, and to a synthetic beta P but not by two antibodies to the carboxyl- and amino-termini of the beta protein precursor (beta PP), which label a subgroup of cerebral cortical plaques. This latter result suggests that the beta P deposited in the cerebellar molecular layer may be derived from a form of the beta PP from which the carboxyl and amino terminal regions of the precursor have already been cleaved. Diffuse cerebellar plaques were not recognized by antibodies to neurofilaments, tau, and PHF, all of which detect dystrophic neurites in cerebral cortical neuritic plaques. Also, no association of reactive astrocytes or microglial cells with diffuse cerebellar plaques was observed. Thus, diffuse cerebellar plaques represent multifocal deposits of noncompacted beta P that cause little or no morphologic reaction in their microenvironment.\r"

HL-swine sera stimulated a significant enhancement in the number of proliferating monocytic precursor cells, regardless of whether or not the BMC were from HL- or N-swine.

Staining was evident in most specimens displaying follicular hyperplasia, but was absent from histologically normal tissue.

The distribution of IL-6 immunoreactivity in different human tumors was studied. IL-6 immunoreactivity was detected by the avidin-biotin-complex (ABC) procedure using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against an E coli-derived human IL-6 (rIL-6). Preimmune rabbit serum used as a control did not yield specific staining and preadsorption of the IL-6 antiserum with rIL-6 abolished specific staining. Strong-to-moderate IL-6 immunoreactivity was observed in the neoplastic elements present in primary squamous cell carcinomas, in adenocarcinomas of mammary, colonic, ovarian, and endometrial origin, in various adenocarcinomas metastatic to lymph nodes, and in soft tissue tumors including leiomyosarcoma and neurofibrosarcoma. Weak-to-moderate IL-6 immunostaining was observed in Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This study demonstrates that most human tumors stain positively for IL-6, adding weight to the hypothesis that IL-6 is a key cytokine that participates in the host-tumor interaction.\r"

  ".W": "Killing of rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells by activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), as measured at 4 hours, is catalase sensitive, iron dependent, and unaffected by addition of protease inhibitors. If the time course for exposure of endothelial cells to activated PMNs is extended to 18 hours, progressive injury occurs. Endothelial cell injury resulting at 18 hours is partially inhibited by catalase and partially inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor. Together, these two inhibitors function synergistically to protect the cells from injury. Exposure of endothelial cells to reagent H2O2 and purified proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and cathepsin G) mimics the effects of activated PMNs: H2O2 alone is cytotoxic with maximal killing achieved by 4 hours; proteolytic enzymes produce cytotoxicity only at high concentrations and only after prolonged incubation (longer than 8 hours); and, in combination, H2O2 and proteolytic enzymes act synergistically. These data provide compelling evidence that PMN-mediated injury of endothelial cells involves interaction between oxygen products and proteases.\r"

Ten mAB, which recognize human PR on frozen sections, were tested. Six could detect PR in paraffin sections, with Li 417, LET 456, and LET 126 giving the best results. LET 126 antibody was used for most further studies. The effects of fixation with picric acid-formaldehyde (PAF), buffered-formalin, or with Bouin solution were investigated; all fixation methods allowed PR immunolabeling, although PAF or buffered formalin usually gave the best results. Positive staining was seen in the nucleus of carcinoma cells. Variations in intensity and extent of immunoreactivity were observed in all sections and among different regions of the same specimen. These were probably related to the heterogeneity of the tumor cell population. Results were compared with the PR content in the respective tumor tissues, determined by steroid-binding assay, and with immunocytochemistry on frozen sections. It was shown that there were correlations between the immunocytochemical staining (positive or negative) and the steroid binding assay (80%) and between the immunocytochemical staining on paraffin sections and on frozen sections (78%). Weaker intensity and fewer number of PR-positive cells were found for paraffin-embedded tumors. Estrogen receptors were also detected on adjacent sections from the same paraffin-embedded tissues by use of monoclonal anti-ER antibodies (ERICA-kit[Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL]) and DNase pretreatment. In conclusion, this immunocytochemical method for detection of PR and ER on paraffin sections offers an alternative to frozen tissue. It allows histologic and immunocytochemical studies on the same sample and retrospective studies on stored tissue blocks.\r"

Glomerular MAC was detected in 50% of patients with idiopathic MN, in 75% of patients with lupus MN, and in only 12.5% of the HBsAg carrier with MN. Glomerular adhesions to Bowman's capsule were associated with a high incidence of glomerular MAC deposition only in patients with idiopathic MN. Lupus patients had a high incidence of MAC deposition and patients with HBV-related MN had a low incidence of MAC deposition, in both cases regardless of the presence of glomerular capsular adhesions. It is unlikely that deposition of S-protein could inhibit the glomerular damage in idiopathic or lupus MN because significant glomerular capsular adhesions and MAC deposition were observed despite the concomitant glomerular deposition of S-protein. It was concluded that activation of terminal components of complement may play a role in glomerular injuries in idiopathic and lupus MN. The rare occurrence of glomerular MAC deposition in HBV-related MN could be related to its distinct immunopathogenetic mechanism and its indolent clinical course.\r"

They were transplantable to male, but not to female or castrated male nude mice. A significant number of androgen as well as estrogen binding sites were demonstrated in the nuclei of the transplanted tumor cells by in situ autoradiography. Neither virus particle nor mouse mammary tumor virus-specific antigen expression was detected in the tumor cells by electron microscopic and immunohistochemical studies. Normal females were generally free of pigment and tumor, although the androgen treatment induced marked pigmentation (deposit of nonfluorescent lipofuscin and hemosiderin) and hyperplasia of the female mammary epithelial cells, without a tumor. Possible relationships between pigmentation and tumor development were considered.\r"

To investigate the hypothesis that the strikingly different biological behaviors of low-grade and high-grade astrocytomas might be related to cell lineage, 38 astrocytomas (grades I through IV), were examined for the presence of the A2B5 antigen, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and galactocerebroside (GC), a marker for oligodendrocytes. Twenty-nine of the tumors (76%) were composed of moderate or high densities of GFAP+ and unlabeled cells, and were devoid of A2B5+ and GC+ neoplastic cells. Only four tumors had high densities (75% to 100%) of A2B5+ cells, three of which were grade I tumors; two tumors, also Grade I, contained moderate densities (20% to 25%) of GC+ cells that had cytologic features of astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. The findings suggest that most cerebral astrocytomas lack the A2B5 antigen and thus may represent neoplasia along the type 1 astrocyte lineage. In contrast, A2B5+ lineage among astrocytomas, ie, neoplasia with differentiation toward type 2 astrocytes and GC+ oligodendrocytes, is less common and may be correlated with prognostically favorable histopathologic features.\r"

This hypothesis was investigated by immunostaining histopathologic sections with monoclonal antibodies to GC, A2B5, and GFAP. In 28 tumors, ubiquitous immunolabeling of neoplastic cells with anti-GC and anti-A2B5 was observed. In addition, GFAP+/A2B5+ astrocytes were present in most mixed glial tumors.

The authors provide a historical overview of the concept, review its modern successors, and provide recommendations for its inclusion in DSM-IV as a proposed diagnostic category needing further study.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this project was to answer the question, \"Can shoulder instability be dealt with safely and effectively arthroscopically?\" This study, which began in December 1982 and concluded in February 1985, involved 12 patients, 3 females and 9 males whose ages ranged from 14 to 40 years. Followup ranged from 31 to 63 months, the average being 44.8 months. The arthroscopic procedure was based on the use of a tool designed to capture the capsule, thus allowing placement of either one or two low profile extraarticular staples in the capsule. Two cases were failures. The remaining 10 patients were pleased with their operation. Based on the classification of Rowe et al., functional results were six excellent, two good, two fair, and two poor. The six patients with excellent results had shoulders of normal appearance. They were fully active and had neither pain nor limitation of motion. All six patients had negative apprehension signs. The two patients with good results had similar outcomes, but they had occasional morning stiffness and intermittent mild pain, as well as a 10 degrees limitation of external rotation in both adduction and abduction. One patient who had a fair result had a positive apprehension sign and occasional pain with quick motion. The other patient with a fair result was hampered by more significant pain on an intermittent basis, yet the pain was not a constant issue. None of these patients had radiographic evidence of increased degenerative changes of the shoulder or staple migration. There were two complications and two failures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although there are several different classification systems for the description of articular cartilage damage, each has certain limitations and deficiencies which can lead to confusion. We are proposing a new system which describes articular cartilage abnormalities in simple terms. It is based on four separate and distinct variables: the description of the articular surface, the extent (depth) of involvement, the diameter of the lesion, and the location of the lesion. Although somewhat qualitative and subjective, the system enables the surgeon to record observed articular cartilage changes. We have used this grading as part of our overall knee rating system and have found it helpful in comparing treatment results between our different studies. For research purposes, a point scaling system facilitates computerization and statistical analysis of the data.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review was undertaken of 16 adolescent patients (20 feet) with tarsal coalitions. All patients were active in sports and were seen in the Sports Medicine Clinic. Ages ranged from 9 to 17 years (average, 13 years). Failing conservative therapy, 18 feet had resection of the tarsal bar; 1 patient (2 feet) had bilateral extraarticular subtalar arthrodeses. The patients were seen in followup an average of 5.1 years postoperatively (range, 2 to 10 years). An objective ankle/foot score was developed and all patients improved their score postoperatively, with the average score being improved 25%. Nineteen of 20 feet (95%) had excellent or good postoperative results by the ankle/foot score, while 17 of 20 (85%) had an excellent or good subjective result. Two bars in two feet (10%), both in the same patient, recurred. There were six patients with preoperative talar beaking, and all had an excellent or good followup result. All males returned to their previous level of competition in sports, while three female patients (three feet) gave up sports. Resection of tarsal coalitions, even in the presence of talar beaking without other degenerative changes, yields consistently good follow-up results.\r"

Thirty-two patients were treated with placebo tablets and 36 with 600 mg ibuprofen tablets taken four times a day for 4 to 6 days. All of the patients were immobilized and requested to keep the foot elevated. The results showed that ibuprofen had no effect on the ankle swelling. The need for additional analgesics was not influenced by treatment with ibuprofen, which means that ibuprofen has no effect on pain. The time elapsed from occurrence of the injury to arrival at the casualty ward was negatively correlated to the reduction of ankle joint swelling during the treatment period. Treatment with ice-sprays, icebags, or cold water during the acute stage of injury did not influence the reduction of swelling during the treatment period.\r"

The very premature (less than 33 weeks gestation) were most at risk (four of eight deteriorated). Deterioration or development of lesions occurred only in very ill babies with known risk factors. Anaesthesia did not appear to be implicated in any case.\r"
