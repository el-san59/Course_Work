In the perennially-flowing Pemba River, relatively small numbers of snails were collected; they were found only during the hot dry season (December to March). In a tributary stream, the Kadingo River, whose flow ceased at the end of both the cool and hot dry seasons, snail numbers peaked at the end of the cool dry season (October to November) and at the beginning of the hot dry season (January). Large numbers of infected snails were found in the Kadingo River from November to January (short rainy season and beginning of dry season). Selective mass chemotherapy with metrifonate and provision of piped water were begun in February and March 1984. These control measures achieved a significant reduction in the infection rate of snails (P less than 0.001); the annual infection rate for the 2 years before treatment was 9.3% and 13.1%, and for the 2 years after treatment was 3.5% and 3.4%.\r"

Patients were treated with a single dose of 40 mg/kg body weight of praziquantel. Six months after dosing, 51% and 58% were cured of the infection with 81% and 84% reduction in egg burden in the Symmers' and non-Symmers' patients, respectively.

The cationic fraction correctly identified 100% of 20 patients as infected with S. mansoni; moreover, 50% (10 of 20) seroconverted to negative by 2 years post-treatment and 100% of 15 patients tested were negative 5 years post-treatment. In general, the cationic fraction was superior to the unpurified soluble egg antigen for the detection of infection and for the prediction of chemotherapeutic success. The cationic fraction also exhibited greater immunologic specificity over the unpurified soluble egg antigen in that the latter exhibited higher titers than the former to antibodies against heterologous parasite antigens (Fasciola hepatica, Clonorchis sinensis, Paragonimus westermani adult worms; Trichinella spiralis larvae). Moreover, rabbit antisera raised against egg antigens isolated from the precipitation formed when fresh S. mansoni eggs are incubated with S. mansoni infection of immunization sera (known as circumoval precipitin reactions or COP) reacted strongly with the cationic fraction in ELISA. In addition, antiserum to the cationic fraction as well as antisera against either of the two antigenic components of this fraction, known as antigens alpha 1 and omega 1, all give positive COP reactions when incubated with fresh S. mansoni eggs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The parasites were isolated from mice infected 4 weeks previously and the subfractions were prepared by extraction in buffered saline or in detergent. A variety of immunization protocols were conducted in rats and mice. These included different sites of injection, dose size, and number of booster injections; different adjuvants; and the effects of boosting with live infections. Induction of a partial resistance is observed in rats, but has not been achieved in mice immunized by the same procedures. The alum-precipitated detergent-solubilized fraction was superior at lower doses. Exposure of rats to a low dose cercarial infection 3 weeks prior to challenge did not boost the resistance if the rats were already partially resistant through vaccination with worm subfractions in adjuvant. Serum from vaccinated rats transfers partial protection to a challenge infection of naive rats.\r"

Autoradiography was used to measure the proportion of radiolabeled schistosomula which could be recovered from lung tissue by mincing and incubation. There was no difference between the two sets of mice at each time point, and no substantial diminution in the proportion recovered over the sampling period of 7 to 17 days post-infection. By this in vitro criterion, the emergence of schistosomula from lung fragments was not influenced by inflammation. However, we are unable to rule out the possibility that migration is impeded by inflammation in vivo. The migratory potential and viability of schistosomula recovered after residence in the lungs for increasing lengths of time was assessed by their introduction into the vasculature of naive recipients. The results indicate that significant numbers of schistosomula are capable of maturation, but fail to mature if left in situ in the lungs of both normal and vaccinated mice. No evidence was found that schistosomula suffer cytotoxic injury in the skin, subsequently dying in the lungs, or that they are damaged by the pulmonary inflammatory reactions which develop in vaccinated mice. Schistosomula delivered to the alveoli have a limited capacity to reenter tissues and mature. We suggest that in normal C57BL/6 mice the deflection of parasites into the alveoli during migration is the reason why many fail to mature. In vaccinated C57BL/6 mice a similar but augmented process may account for the elimination of a greater proportion of challenge parasites.\r"

Using serum from C57BL/6J mice acutely infected with S. mansoni, which strongly reacts with these peptides and very weakly with other worm proteins, portions of the 70 kDa peptide were cloned from an expression cDNA library. The value and limitations of using recombinant schistosome antigens in serodiagnostic assays is discussed.\r"

Though simple to perform and highly specific, DD5 is not practical for population studies due to the time lapse between testing and receiving results. This work evaluates the application of an enzyme immunoassay to screen sera for subsequent processing using DD5. The efficiency of an enzyme immunoassay screening/DD5 confirmation scheme vs. DD5 alone was compared within the framework of a control program. A total of 5,839 sera from residents of endemic areas was processed and 47 hydatid patients were detected by both schemes. The proposed enzyme immunoassay identified all sera having antibody activity against arc 5 antigens detectable by DD5 and ruled out 95.3% of sera which tested by DD5 would have produced negative results.\r"

  ".W": "An outbreak of icteric non-A non-B (NANB) hepatitis occurred in a residential community of urban Karachi, Pakistan, from August 1986 through October 1986. Of the 114 cases reported from this community during the 1986 calendar year, a clustering of 85 cases was seen during the above period. Twenty-seven percent of 226 households and 9% of 1,250 individuals were affected. Five persons were hospitalized and 1 death occurred in a young pregnant woman. Cases occurred predominantly in the less than or equal to 29-year-old age group (72%), with a male:female ratio of 1.8:1. Thirty-four cases occurred singly within households, while in 28 households multiple cases were seen. Analysis of the epidemic curve and intervals of onset of multiple cases within households suggested prolonged common source exposure rather than secondary person-to-person transmission. No single water source was implicated but a contaminated municipal supply was presumed. Information collected from several other communities and from a university hepatitis reference laboratory suggested that the outbreak was part of a larger urban epidemic of NANB hepatitis. Based upon this investigation and data from recently published reports, it is concluded that NANB hepatitis is endemic in Pakistan.\r"

One woman had a second scan on a separate admission and was considered two individual patients in the analysis. Twenty-six women had appendicitis, 10 of whom had a perforated appendix at surgery. The TAC-WBC scan was indeterminate (abnormal but nondiagnostic for appendicitis) in 52 women (47%), nine of whom had appendicitis. Fifty-eight scans were read as positive or negative for appendiceal pathology. There were 16 true positives, 5 false positives, 36 true negatives, and 1 false negative. The predictive value of a positive scan was 76%, and the predictive value of a negative scan was 97%. The TAC-WBC scan was positive in 62% of patients with appendicitis and negative in 43% of the patients without appendicitis resulting in an overall accuracy of 47% in the 109 women. The main value of TAC-WBC scan in women with possible appendicitis is its high negative predictive value and the main problem with the TAC-WBC scan is its high indeterminate rate.\r"

Along with incomplete neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis, presynaptic markers of the EAA system are immature in the developing brain; however, postsynaptic EAA system activities, particularly of the N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate receptors, are transiently enhanced early in life. This transient enhancement is presumably beneficial to the immature brain because physiologic activation of the EAA system plays a critical role in plasticity of early learning and morphogenesis. At the same time, this transient hypersensitivity renders the immature brain vulnerable to pathologic excitation of the EAA system (excitotoxicity) as observed during neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.\r"

Round foci of PVH surrounding the frontal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles were observed in 4 infants (PVH pattern I). Continuous PVH was observed in 17 infants (PVH patterns II and III). Fourteen infants with continuous PVH had spastic diplegia or quadriplegia. Developmental delay was demonstrated in 15 infants with continuous PVH. No PVH pattern I infants had cerebral palsy; only 1 such infant had mild developmental delay. Our study suggests that the extent of PVH reflects the severity of brain damage in neonates with cerebral injuries.\r"

Brain death was determined by absence of brainstem function, including loss of all cranial nerve responses and sustained apnea (PCO2 greater than 60 torr) for 48 hours with confirmation of findings by an outside consulting child neurologist. The initial examinations of these 12 infants revealed spontaneous movements and startle myoclonus (12), suck, root, and gag responses (7), increased tone (8), deep tendon reflexes (9), absent pupillary responses (9), absent oculocephalic and corneal responses (6), absent auditory/Moro responses (7), and nonvisualization of the optic nerve (8). Mild depression of neurologic function occurred during the first several days of life; subsequently, the infants' responses were easier to elicit and more sustained. Only 2 infants met the clinical criteria for brain death. Neuropathologic findings indicated that observed complex motor responses were not based upon cortical activity because no infant had a normally-formed cerebrum. Brainstem neuronal activity may have accounted for these motor responses in some patients but even at this level neurons were scanty or absent. Our findings suggest that, although rare, clinical brain death can be determined in liveborn anencephalic infants; ophthalmologic and otologic developmental abnormalities may confound examination of cranial nerve function; and absence of cortical neurons supports the widely held opinion that these infants do not experience sensation.\r"

The relationship between the dose of ACTH and long-term prognosis was investigated in 29 patients. There was no relationship between the daily or total ACTH dosage, provided the dose was greater than 0.015 mg (0.6 IU)/kg/day, and the outcome of seizures and electroencephalographic abnormalities; however, ACTH 0.04-0.06 mg (1.6-2.4 IU)/kg/day and a total ACTH dose of 1.1-1.5 mg (44-60 IU)/kg resulted in better mental development than smaller doses of ACTH. Side effects of ACTH increased with dosage. Too small or too large a dose of ACTH does not lead to better mental development. The proper dose of ACTH should be used with careful attention to potential side effects.\r"

Eight of these patients demonstrated an unusual clinical course characterized by persistent fever (duration: greater than 10 days), cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, profound meningeal enhancement on computed tomography, significant morbidity, and a prolonged hospital course. The mean age of these 8 patients was 6 months, in contrast to a mean age of 14 months for the entire group. Two patients had clinical evidence of relapse. Four of the 8 patients tested for latex particle agglutination in the cerebrospinal fluid remained positive after 10 days. All patients received antimicrobial therapy until they were afebrile for a minimum of 5 days. Subsequent neurologic examination revealed a persistent seizure disorder in 5 patients (62.5%), moderate-to-profound hearing loss in 2 (25%), mild ataxia in 1 (12.5%), and developmental delay with hydrocephalus which required shunting in 1 (12.5%). One patient had no sequelae.\r"

Secretory IgA in nasopharyngeal secretions was found to have antibody activity against the bacteria. Adherence of both bacteria was significantly smaller in the group having secretory IgA antibody activity than in the group having no activity. These results suggest that bacterial adherence to the nasopharynx may play an important role in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion in children, and that secretory IgA in nasopharyngeal secretions may be related to the decrease of adherence.\r"

Although tissue expansion is simplistic in concept, it does require judgment and indepth preoperative planning to ensure optimal results. The complication rate is high for tissue expansion in the head and neck, particularly in the cheek and neck area. Despite the frequency of complications, in the vast majority of cases the intended reconstruction is successful.\r"

During the past several years, a number of experienced surgeons have turned to the use of Mersilene mesh. Mersilene mesh is a non-absorbable Dacron polyester fiber that can be conformed easily into layers to achieve tailored dimensions and shape. At the McCollough Plastic Surgery Clinic PA, Birmingham, Ala, 277 patients over a 10-year period underwent chin augmentation with Mersilene mesh implants. The material provides excellent tensile strength, durability, and surgical adaptability. The overall complication rate was 3.2% (nine patients); infection rate, 2.5% (seven patients); and removal secondary to infection, 1.7% (five patients). Based on this 10-year experience, Mersilene mesh remains our material of choice for chin augmentation.\r"

We present the results of a case-control study of risk factors for these cancers, with risk estimates derived from self-administered comprehensive risk-factor questionnaires distributed to patients at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. Cases were 64 patients with histologically confirmed salivary gland cancer. Control subjects, randomly selected from the same patient population excluding patients with cancer of the head and neck or nonmelanoma skin cancer, were frequency-matched to the cases by age, sex, and ethnicity to achieve a 2:1 control subjects/cases ratio. On multivariate analysis, prior radiotherapy was a significant risk factor for both men (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1) and women (OR = 2.3). Among women, higher educational attainment (OR = 2.4), alcohol use (OR = 2.0), and hairdye use (OR = 2.5) were also significantly associated with risk. There were no significant differences between cases and control subjects with respect to tobacco exposure or specific occupational or leisure-time exposures. There is biological plausibility for associations with hairdye use and alcohol exposure.\r"

A single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg) was combined with three injections of fluorouracil given during a 24-hour period (total dose, 150 or 80 mg/kg) before, during, or after cisplatin administration. The combined effect of cisplatin and fluorouracil on tumor growth and toxic effects was schedule dependent.

The wild-type viral warts suspension was used to induce treatable papilloma warts in the cutaneous tissue of Dutch Belted rabbits. The photosensitizing agents used intravenously were Photofrin II at 10 mg/kg of body weight and Chlorin e6 monoethylene diamine monohydrochloric acid (Chlorin e6 med HCl) at 1 mg/kg of body weight. The lasers used were an argon-dye laser at 628 and 655 nm and a gold vapor laser at 628 nm. The irradiances of 25 to 180 mW/cm2 were applied topically with an end-on lens optical fiber with total radiant doses of 7.5 to 54 J/cm2. Photofrin II and the argon-dye laser at the highest light dosage (54 J/cm2) and Chlorin e6 monoethylene diamine monohydrochloride administered 2 hours before argon-dye laser irradiation at 655 nm at the highest light dosage (54 J/cm2) produced wart regression. Total wart regression without recurrence was achieved with Photofrin II and the gold vapor laser at all light dosages. The difference observed between the argon-dye laser and the gold vapor laser might be explained by the pulsed nature of the gold vapor laser, with its high-peak powers, some 5000 x the average measured light dose. In this model, the smaller, less cornified lesions were more effectively treated with photodynamic therapy.\r"

Several color photographs of representative ears are shown. In the active stage of OME, edema (73.1%) and hyperemia (23.1%) were characteristic features of the middle ear mucosa, and normal mucosa was seen in only one ear (3.1%). The tympanic orifice of the eustachian tube, which could be examined in 12 ears, were stenosed with edema in four ears (33.3%) or plugged with effusion in three ears (25.0%) in this group. In the convalescent stage of OME, dilated vessels were most often seen (69.2%), but the rest of the patients had normal mucosa (30.8%) in the middle ear, and none of them had edema nor hyperemia. The tympanic orifice of the eustachian tube, which could be examined in five ears, was clearly patent in all the patients in this group. One ear that was treated with a ventilation tube for 1 month showed dilated vessels and less severe inflammation than did ears that were in the active stage of OME, and three ears that were treated for more than 3 months showed almost normal middle ear mucosa.\r"

Because CT scanning seems to offer little advantage over palpation in the nonirradiated neck, it should not be regarded as an essential tool in the staging of nodal disease. After radiation therapy, as neck dissection is only performed because of clinical or radiologic suspicion, CT scanning is of utmost importance.\r"

Pedigrees 1 through 6 showed autosomal dominant inheritance; two also had irregular dominant properties (pedigrees 4 and 7), and one (pedigree 7) could not be excluded from the possibility of having an X-linked recessive inheritance. During the investigation, there were latent accessory auricles in which the cartilages were seen to be subcutaneous only or protruding slightly. Genetically, the pathogenesis of an accessory auricle should be related to the accessory auricular gene.\r"

Characteristically, only one ear is involved (87% of patients), and the lesion is usually located within the scaphoid or triangular fossa of the anthelix. Previous trauma to the involved ear is uncommon. The diagnosis may be suggested by the clinical features, and analysis of the aspirated cystic fluid and/or histologic examination of a lesional biopsy specimen will confirm the diagnosis. Therapeutic intervention that maintains the architecture of the patient's external ear should be used in the treatment of this benign condition.\r"

This class of fungal sinus infection has emerged only in the past decade; it occurs primarily in immunocompetent individuals and produces a tenacious, progressive pansinusitis. To our knowledge, this study describes the first case of multiple intracranial mucoceles secondary to E rostratum.

In the present study the clinical applicability of M-mode guided two-dimensional integrated backscatter imaging was defined in evaluation of 55 nonselected patients. The mean amplitude of cyclic variation of integrated backscatter in normal segments (long-axis view) was as follows: basal septum, 4.2 +/- 1.3 dB (mean +/- SD; n = 27), mid-septum, 4.5 +/- 1.0 dB (n = 26), basal posterior, 4.8 +/- 1.0 dB (n = 30), and mid-posterior, 4.8 +/- 1.2 decibels (n = 27). The respective mean delay values (R wave to nadir) were as follows: 0.89 +/- 0.09, 0.84 +/- 0.09, 0.86 +/- 0.09, and 0.85 +/- 0.12. At least one cardiac cycle could be analyzed fully in 62% of patients. Limitations included technically difficult two-dimensional echocardiography, inadequate M-line orientation, technically remediable errors, or poor quality integrated backscatter images. In abnormal segments (n = 13) cyclic variation was reduced and delay was prolonged (1.2 +/- 1.1 dB and 1.21 +/- 1.1, respectively). Intraobserver and interobserver variability for amplitude measurements were modest, with respective correlation coefficients of r = 0.93; r = 0.72. The findings demonstrate that M-mode--assisted integrated backscatter is a practical approach for characterization of regional myocardial properties promptly and at the bedside in a large portion of patients with cardiac disease.\r"

These histograms are then shifted to a position of best correlation. The number of radial bins through which the histograms at end systole are shifted to correlate with those of the frame at end diastole defines the regional motion. The methods are described and preliminary findings are presented.\r"

The following indexes were studied: isovolumic relaxation time, pressure half-time, peak early mitral flow velocity, and peak mitral flow velocity after atrial systole. Intraobserver and interobserver variability were assessed by regression analysis. Individual components of variance (subject, reader, beat, day, and tracing) were estimated in a subset of five patients and five normal subjects, and estimated total variance defined for each group. Temporal (day-to-day) variability for 95% confidence was estimated for these patients and for normal subjects. Temporal variability in the group from which the subsets were drawn was measured from absolute and percent change in values on two occasions. Estimated and observed 95% confidence limits were compared. Intersubject variability was the largest component of variance in both transplant recipients and in normal subjects. For all indexes in transplant recipients (in the absence of rejection) and normal subjects, observed absolute mean differences (+/- 2 standard deviations) between values from recordings taken on two different days were larger than the 95% confidence limits estimated from the components of variance analysis. The observed 95% limits for transplant recipients versus normal subjects were as follows: isovolumic relaxation time, 20 msec versus 6 msec; pressure half-time, 16 msec versus 9 msec; peak early mitral flow velocity, 32 cm per second versus 17 cm per second; and peak mitral flow velocity after atrial systole, 28 cm per second versus 10 cm per second.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Biventricular stroke volumes were measured in 10 normal subjects for validation of methods and differed by 2.8%. Reading errors were 3.7%. Signal quality improved between the first and last observation (p less than 0.05). Velocity signals were corrected for intercept angles, which averaged 12 and 19 degrees for right heart flows and 31 and 32 degrees for the left side of the heart in all subjects. Negative correlations occurred between intercept angles and the chronologic order in which the patients were studied for left (p = 0.02) and right (p = 0.05) flows. Mean flow areas varied 9% in the left ventricle and 20% in the right ventricle. Total variability for measuring flow determined from control values was 11% to 13%. When twice the variability was used as the detectable level of change, only exercise provoked real increases in biventricular flows in the majority of patients. We conclude that serial measurements of flow by Doppler echocardiographic methods had to exceed 20% to 25% to achieve significant change. Measuring intercept angle, resolving flow area, and learning are variables that need greater emphasis.\r"

Continuous apical flow was visualized in 25% of dilated cardiomyopathies and in no normal patients. Apical velocities were significantly increased in cardiomyopathies with significant mitral regurgitation. Outflow velocities were decreased in dilated cardiomyopathy. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and apical dyskinesis, flow directed toward the base was measured in the middle left ventricle during isovolumic relaxation secondary to dyskinetic rebound. Patterns of abnormal flow in dilated cardiomyopathies are readily apparent by color M-mode and two-dimensional color Doppler.\r"

Although significant differences between absolute values for peak velocities and velocity time integrals at these sample volume locations have previously been reported, no information exists that has compared changes in inflow profiles after an intervention to improve left ventricular filling. To address this question, 13 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure, 50 +/- 13 mm Hg) caused by chronic thromboembolic disease were studied with use of Doppler echocardiography immediately before and after surgical reduction of pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 916 +/- 413 to 233 +/- 89 dynes.sec.cm5). This clinical model has been shown to have abnormal mitral inflow velocity profiles that improve markedly after surgery. Doppler measures of early and late peak velocities were significantly lower both before and after surgery when sampling at the mitral anulus compared with the leaflet tips, although late filling parameters and the deceleration of early flow velocity tended to differ little. With surgery, the significant increase in peak early velocity and the ratio of early to late velocity was present regardless of the sample volume location (peak E at leaflet tips, 47.1 +/- 16.0 to 68.9 +/- 15.4 [p less than 0.001], and at anulus, 40.7 +/- 11.3 to 56.2 +/- 14.6 cm/sec [p less than 0.001]; peak E/A at leaflet tips, 0.95 +/- 0.4 to 1.55 +/- 0.9, and at anulus, 0.78 +/- 0.3 to 1.32 +/- 0.7 [both p less than 0.02]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that a major advantage of Doppler color flow mapping is its ability to visualize areas of disturbed (\"turbulent\") flow, for example, in valvular stenosis or regurgitation and in shunts. To investigate how various color flow mapping instruments display disturbed flow information, color image processing was used to evaluate the most common velocity-variance color encoding algorithms of seven commercially available ultrasound machines. In six of seven machines, green was reportedly added by the variance display algorithms to map areas of disturbed flow. The amount of green intensity added to each pixel along the red and blue portions of the velocity reference color bar was calculated for each machine. In this study, velocities displayed on the reference color bar ranged from +/- 46 to +/- 64 cm/sec, depending on the Nyquist limit. Of note, changing the Nyquist limits depicted on the color reference bars did not change the distribution of the intensities of red, blue, or green within the contour of the reference map, but merely assigned different velocities to the pixels. Most color flow mapping algorithms in our study added increasing intensities of green to increasing positive (red) or negative (blue) velocities along their color reference bars. Most of these machines also added increasing green to red and blue color intensities horizontally across their reference bars as a marker of increased variance (spectral broadening). However, at any given velocity, marked variations were noted between different color flow mapping instruments in the amount of green added to their color velocity reference bars.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were grouped according to their M-mode aortic root diameter as measured in the left parasternal position. The measured groups ranged from 2.0 to 4.5 cm, grouped at 0.1 cm intervals. As the aortic root size enlarged, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly (p less than 0.001; correlation coefficient, r = 0.75). At an aortic root size in the \"small normal\" range of 2.0 to 2.4 cm, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation was 0% to 15%. In the \"intermediate\" and \"top normal\" ranges of 2.9 to 3.7 cm, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly from 15% to 47%. With aortic root dilation, the prevalence of aortic root regurgitation was generally more than 50%. The severity of aortic regurgitation was semiquantified. Aortic root size was not a good indicator for the severity of aortic regurgitation. Patients with moderate and severe aortic regurgitation had variable aortic root sizes. Throughout the range of aortic root sizes, mild aortic regurgitation predominated. We conclude that aortic regurgitation is a common finding in patients with aortic roots that are dilated or are in the \"top normal\" size range, that the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increases linearly with aortic root size, and that aortic root size does not correlate with the severity of aortic regurgitation.\r"

M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography could not reliably distinguish patients with severe aortic stenosis from those with milder obstructions. The hemodynamic information offered by Doppler complemented echocardiographic imaging and provided an alternative modality for evaluation of patients with aortic stenosis. By application of the modified Bernoulli equation, the pressure gradient across the stenotic aortic valve could be estimated by Doppler echocardiography. Though helpful and widely used, the information provided by the pressure gradient across the valve about the severity of the obstruction was not complete. The assessment of valvular aortic stenosis therefore includes an estimation of the valve area by application of the continuity equation. This review examines the maturation of the continuity equation by Doppler techniques and discusses the implications of the procedure.\r"

Seventeen patients (15.3%) died during hospital stay. Age, a previous infarct, high Killip class, cardiomegaly, high serum concentrations of cardiac enzymes, a low ejection fraction, and a high wall motion score index correlated significantly with in-hospital mortality; whereas sex, risk factors, and pericardial effusion did not. Multivariate analysis showed that age and the wall motion score index were the best predictors of death in hospital. Wall motion detected by cross sectional echocardiography may reflect the extent of myocardial involvement. Age and wall motion score index predicted in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 76.5%, a specificity of 91.5%, and a predictive accuracy of 89.2%. Age and the wall motion score index can be determined on admission and are useful for identifying patients at high risk of cardiac death who might benefit from early intervention.\r"

After 18 months' treatment with xamoterol, patients were assessed in a randomised double blind crossover comparison of xamoterol (200 mg twice a day) and placebo, each given for one month. Compared with placebo, xamoterol significantly increased exercise duration and work done on a bicycle ergometer and reduced the maximum exercise heart rate. Assessment of symptoms and activities at 12 months by visual analogue and Likert scales showed a trend towards the relief of symptoms of breathlessness and tiredness and an improvement in activity. There was an improvement in the clinical signs of heart failure and no haemodynamic deterioration over a 12 month period as assessed by ejection fraction. The improvement in exercise tolerance, symptoms, and activities was sustained for 18 months without side effects or development of tolerance.\r"

The transoesophageal images allowed measurement of the thickness of the atrioventricular valve leaflets and the superficial wall layers on the cavity side of both atria. The mean thickness of the anterior tricuspid leaflet was significantly greater than that of the mitral valve--a difference not seen in a control group of age-matched patients without carcinoid tumours and with normal cardiac ultrasound findings. In addition, the edges of the tricuspid leaflets were thickened giving them a clubbed appearance. Tricuspid incompetence was detected transoesophageally in 71% of the patients with carcinoid compared with 57% by transthoracic investigation. The inner layer of the right atrial wall in the carcinoid patients was significantly thicker than that of the left atrium and that of both atria in the controls. Furthermore, patients with other signs of severe carcinoid heart disease had significantly thicker mean right atrial luminal wall layer than those with less or no signs of right heart disease. Transoesophageal cardiac ultrasound investigation improved the diagnostic accuracy and seemed to show the structural changes typical of carcinoid heart disease established by histopathological investigations.\r"

Analysis by district showed that of the classic risk factors only cigarette smoking was strongly associated with heart disease mortality among both men and women. Mean diastolic blood pressure was weakly associated with rates among men and high density lipoprotein cholesterol showed a strong negative association among women. Total cholesterol showed a weak negative association with heart disease mortality, but, because the serum concentrations of cholesterol were uniformly high in all districts, a strong association with mortality would not be expected. In both men and women many dietary factors showed moderate or strong associations with mortality from coronary heart disease in a district--of these a low consumption of vitamin C was most notable. Other factors associated with heart disease included alcohol consumption and serum triglycerides among men, and obesity, physical activity, and serum triglycerides among women. Many factors associated with heart disease showed strong intercorrelations. Clustering of risk factors (including smoking, alcohol, and diet among men, and smoking, diet, and obesity among women) was associated with much of the regional variation in heart disease mortality in Scotland.\r"

In 448 (85%) patients diagnostic pictures were obtained with three standard types of 5 French catheters (No 4 Judkins): that is, left coronary, right coronary, and pigtail catheters. In 60 patients (11.4%) various other 5 French catheters were required to complete the study. In nine patients (1.7%), a 7 or 8 French catheter was used. Major complications causing cardiac arrest or requiring urgent operation developed in five patients. Sixty two patients (11.77%) had minor complications that required sublingual nitrates or a single bolus of atropine, or developed a haematoma that did not need intervention or had a mild reaction to the contrast material. Complications of moderate severity developed in 17 patients (3.2%): severe chest pain, arrhythmia requiring a temporary pacemaker, contrast reaction associated with hypotension, haematoma requiring blood transfusion, or a transient ischaemic episode. There were no deaths. 5 French catheters were used for routine coronary angiography and left ventriculography in 98.3% of patients. There were no major complications related to femoral artery puncture. The routine use of 5 French coronary catheters should increase the feasibility of safe coronary angiography in outpatients and should reduce the cost of this investigation.\r"

  ".U": "91001043\r", 
  ".W": "Mitral valve cusp separation on M mode echogram, the mitral valve opening artefact, and the onset of forward transmitral flow recorded by Doppler echocardiography have all been taken to mark the end of isovolumic relaxation, while its onset has been taken either as the aortic closure sound (A2) recorded phonocardiographically or the aortic closure artefact determined by Doppler technique. Possible differences in the measurement of the isovolumic relaxation time were studied when these landmarks were used in 44 healthy people, 14 patients with mitral stenosis, 21 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and 24 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by recording M mode echograms of the mitral valve, and pulsed and continuous wave Doppler spectra of transmitral flow, with simultaneous electrocardiograms and phonocardiograms. A2 was effectively synchronous with the aortic artefact. However, when the onset of Doppler flow was regarded as the end of isovolumic relaxation, the interval was significantly longer than when mitral cusp separation on M mode echograms was used: by 25 (10) ms in healthy individuals, by 25 (15) ms in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and by 50 (35) ms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In patients with mitral stenosis the interval was only 5 (5) ms longer. The mitral valve opening artefact consistently followed the onset of flow and corresponded much more closely to the E point on the M mode echogram. This shows that it occurred during the rapid filling period and well beyond isovolumic relaxation by any definition. Thus isovolumic relaxation time measured from A2 to the onset of transmitral flow or the mitral valve opening artefact differs from that derived from A2 to mitral valve cusp separation. These intervals cannot be used interchangeably to measure \"isovolumic relaxation time\".\r"

No down modulation was seen following the application of a potent topical corticosteroid. Occlusion increased the yield of IL-1 beta immunoreactivity. Immunoblot patterns of epidermal extracts revealed both the mature form of IL-1 (17 kDa) and the precursor (36 kDa) and were identical in amounts whether the specimens were from controls or from RA- or corticosteroid-treated skin. There was a slight modification in the pattern of high molecular weight proteins (52 kDa) probed by the anti-IL-1 alpha and beta sera. It appears that the IL-1 epidermal immunoreactive pools are barely amenable to modulation because they represent a storage form linked to end-stages of keratinocyte differentiation.\r"

Epidemic KS cells demonstrated invasive migration through reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) as well as through interstitial connective tissue (collagen I) in early passages, whereas fibroblasts did not invade either barrier. Epidemic KS cells in late passages did not show any invasive migration.

The auto-MLR in 20 patients with psoriasis was significantly lower than in 16 normal controls. Lower values were found in untreated psoriatic patients than in those in remission following treatment. The values in the latter group were significantly lower than in controls and in six patients with atopic dermatitis in remission. The tendency for an increase in the auto-MLR with a decrease in disease activity was further confirmed in five patients studied before and after treatment. In contrast, the allogeneic lymphocyte reaction (allo-MLR) in psoriatics was similar to that in normal controls.\r"

Fibroblasts from the skin of patients with keloids, scleroderma and morphoea were cultured in vitro in the presence and absence of pentoxifylline (100-1000 micrograms/ml) to determine whether it inhibits fibroblast proliferation and the production of collagen, glycosaminoglycans (GAG), fibronectin and collagenase activity. The exposure of subconfluent fibroblast cultures to pentoxifylline resulted in non-lethal, dose-dependent reductions in serum-driven fibroblast proliferation, with 1000 micrograms/ml pentoxifylline virtually negating the proliferative effect of serum on the cells. The fibroblasts assayed as confluent cultures produced reduced amounts, by up to 95%, of collagen and GAG, dependent on the concentration of pentoxifylline, both in the presence and absence of serum. Pentoxifylline similarly inhibited the fibronectin production by keloid and scleroderma fibroblasts, but had no effect on collagenase activity.\r"

Infection of the hematopoietic progenitor cells has been proposed as a potential explanation. In this study, different bone marrow cell populations, including the CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, were purified by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) and analyzed for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. A group of 14 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) was studied (11 with peripheral blood cytopenias). The CD4+ helper cells in the bone marrow were found positive for HIV-1 DNA in all patients. In contrast, CD34+ progenitor cells were positive in only one patient. Two monocyte samples and two samples of CD4-/CD34- lymphocytes/blasts (mainly B and CD8 lymphocytes) were positive. Proviral DNA could not be detected in granulocytes. FACS analysis showed that the percentage of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells was not altered in the bone marrow of AIDS patients in comparison with the HIV-1 seronegative controls. In contrast, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes was markedly reduced in the bone marrow of AIDS patients. These results show that the hematologic abnormalities in AIDS patients are neither explained by direct infection of the hematopoietic progenitor cells with HIV-1 nor by a depletion of progenitor cells.\r"

Doses ranging from 250 micrograms/m2 to 500 micrograms/m2 were administered as subcutaneous bolus injections daily for 15 days. An increase in platelet counts from 1,000/microL to 31,000/microL was induced by rhIL-3 in one patient, and an increase in reticulocyte counts by more than 10,000/microL in four patients. The blood leukocyte counts temporarily increased in eight patients 1.5- to 3.3-fold (median, 1.8-fold), mainly due to an increase in the number of neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. In two patients, bone marrow cellularity increased from 7% to 33% and from 10% to 80%, respectively, but without resulting in a substantial improvement of peripheral blood counts. Mild side effects (headache and flushing) were observed in some patients, while low-grade fever occurred in all patients. Transient thrombocytopenia necessitating discontinuation of rhIL-3 treatment occurred in one patient. In conclusion, rhIL-3 can stimulate hematopoiesis in patients with aplastic anemia; however, no lasting effects were obtained.\r"

Sixty-nine received CEPP(B) as second-line or subsequent therapy after relapse from previous combination chemotherapy, and 14 patients received CEPP(B) as first-line therapy. Of 75 patients evaluable for response, 30 patients (40%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 24 patients (32%) achieved a partial response (PR), providing an overall response rate of 72%. Complete responses were recorded on 21 of 61 (34%) patients with recurrent disease and 9 of the 14 patients who received CEPP(B) as first line therapy (64%). Myelosuppression was the major side effect of treatment, resulting in eight neutropenic-febrile episodes from a total of 253 courses. A single fatal toxic event occurred on a patient who developed adult respiratory distress syndrome. Overall, CEPP(B) was well-tolerated and proved to be effective palliative therapy for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after relapse. As such, CEPP(B) may be considered for cytoreduction before ablative therapy and bone marrow transplantation. CEPP(B) may also be considered for initial therapy in selected patients who cannot tolerate doxorubicin-containing regimens.\r"

  ".W": "Marrow cells from 36 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (13 refractory anemia [RA], 14 refractory anemia with excess of blasts [RAEB], 9 RAEB in transformation [RAEB-T]) were evaluated for their in vitro proliferative and differentiative responsiveness to recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-monocyte CSF (GM-CSF). GM-CSF exerted a stronger proliferative stimulus than G-CSF for marrow myeloid clonal growth (CFU-GM) in these patients (44 v 12 colonies per 10(5) nonadherent buoyant bone marrow cells [NAB], respectively, P less than .025). GM-CSF stimulated increased CFU-GM growth in the 16 patients with abnormal marrow cytogenetics in comparison with the 20 patients who had normal cytogenetics (52 and 30 colonies per 10(5) NAB, respectively, P less than .05), whereas no such difference could be demonstrated with G-CSF (11 and 16 colonies per 10(5) NAB, respectively). In contrast, granulocytic differentiation of marrow cells was induced in liquid culture by G-CSF in 15 of 32 (47% patients), while GM-CSF did so in only 4 of 18 (22%) patients (P less than .025) including, for RAEB/RAEB-T patients: 9 of 18 versus 0 of 9, respectively (P less than .025). For MDS patients with normal cytogenetics, G-CSF- and GM-CSF-induced marrow cell granulocytic differentiation in 12 of 18 (67%) versus 3 of 11 (27%), respectively (P less than .025), contrasted with granulocytic induction in only 3 of 14 (21%) and 1 of 7 (14%) patients with abnormal cytogenetics, respectively. We conclude that G-CSF has greater granulocytic differentiative and less proliferative activity for MDS marrow cells than GM-CSF in vitro, particularly for RAEB/RAEB-T patients and those with normal cytogenetics.\r"

Alternatively spliced transcripts of the human CSF-1 gene encode at least two different transmembrane precursors that are differentially processed in mammalian expression systems. The larger precursor rapidly undergoes proteolysis to yield the secreted growth factor and does not give rise to forms of CSF-1 detected on the cell surface. By contrast, the smaller human CSF-1 precursor is stably expressed on the plasma membrane where it is inefficiently cleaved to release a soluble molecule. To determine whether the smaller precursor is biologically active on the cell surface, mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing the different forms of human CSF-1 were killed by chemical fixation and tested for their ability to support the proliferation of cells that require this growth factor. Only fixed cells expressing human CSF-1 precursors on their surface stimulated the growth in vitro of a murine macrophage cell line or normal mouse bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. The ability of these nonviable fibroblasts to induce the proliferation of CSF-1-dependent cells was not mediated by release of soluble growth factor, required direct contact with the target cells, and was blocked by neutralizing antiserum to CSF-1. These results demonstrate that the cell surface form of the human CSF-1 precursor is biologically active and indicate that plasma membrane-bound growth factors can functionally interact with receptor-bearing targets by direct cell-cell contact.\r"

Induction of normal bone marrow colony formation by IL-3 was much less sensitive to TGF-beta 1, and there was little or no effect of TGF-beta 1 on colony formation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). In different clones of myeloid leukemic cells, TGF-beta 1 suppressed differentiation induced with IL-6, IL-1 alpha, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but did not suppress differentiation induced with IL-3 or GM-CSF. The effect of TGF-beta 1 on differentiation of the leukemic cells can be dissociated from its effect on cell growth. TGF-beta 1 suppressed the production of IL-6 in normal bone marrow cells cultured with IL-1 alpha and the production of IL-6 and GM-CSF in leukemic cells cultured with IL-1 alpha or LPS. The suppression of IL-6 production can explain the suppression by TGF-beta 1 of the effects of IL-1 alpha and LPS that are mediated by IL-6. TGF-beta 1 also suppressed differentiation in clones of myeloid leukemic cells induced with differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor and tumor necrosis factor. In different leukemic clones TGF-beta 1 suppressed or enhanced induction of differentiation with dexamethasone. The results show that TGF-beta 1 can selectively control the activity of different molecular regulators of normal and leukemic hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "The accurate measurement of biologically active erythropoietin (Ep) in human serum and plasma using present in vivo and in vitro bioassays is difficult because of the presence of both inhibitors and non-Ep stimulators of erythropoiesis. We have developed a simple procedure to quantitatively purify Ep from serum and plasma for subsequent testing in the phenylhydrazine-treated mouse spleen cell assay. The method involves absorption of Ep to an immobilized high-affinity anti-Ep monoclonal antibody and acid elution of the antibody-bound material. After neutralization, the eluted EP is then tested directly in the in vitro bioassay without interference by other serum proteins. By using magnetic beads as a solid support for the antibody, washing and elution steps can be performed rapidly and efficiently. Recoveries of Ep after this procedure show very little sample-to-sample variation and are consistently between 45% and 55%, which is close to the maximum binding expected for the anti-Ep antibody. Coupled with the 7.4-fold concentration that this procedure affords, there is an overall increase in sensitivity of three- to fourfold, which makes this assay suitable for accurately measuring Ep levels in patients with below-average titers. Results with this magnetic bead assay indicate that accurate and reproducible estimates for Ep levels in the serum and plasma from healthy donors as well as from patients with hematologic disorders can be obtained. Titers of biologically active Ep in the sera from a group of patients with either leukemia or lymphoma were found to be elevated, and the values correlated well with titers of immunoreactive Ep measured in the Ep radioimmunoassay. Because of its specificity and high sensitivity, the magnetic bead assay is a valuable alternative to immunoassays for the measurement of elevated, normal, and even subnormal Ep levels in human serum and plasma.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rEp) on murine hematopoietic progenitors were studied using a serum-free culture. A high concentration of rEp stimulated the formation of mixed erythroid-megakaryocyte colonies (EM colonies) and blast cell colonies, as well as erythroid colonies, erythroid bursts, and megakaryocyte colonies from normal mouse bone marrow cells. Direct effects of rEp on EM colony, megakaryocyte colony, and erythroid burst formation were confirmed by depletion of accessory cells such as T cells, B cells, and macrophages from crude bone marrow cells, and inhibition of the colonies by the addition of rabbit anti-rEp antibody to the culture in a dose-dependent fashion. Replating experiments were performed to confirm the differentiating ability of blast cell colonies grown in the presence of rEp. Most of the blast cell colonies yielded not only secondary erythroid colonies but also megakaryocyte colonies in the presence of 2 IU/mL rEp. Some of the blast cell colonies produced secondary EM colonies in the presence of 16 IU/ml rEp of 2 IU/mL rEp plus interleukin-3, although no granulocyte-macrophage colonies were found in the secondary culture. These results suggest that Ep acts not only as a late-acting factor that is specific for erythroid progenitors, but also as a bipotential EM-stimulating factor for murine hematopoietic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Uremic patients have an impaired platelet function that has been related to membrane glycoprotein (GP) abnormalities. Using a perfusion system, we have studied the interaction of normal and uremic platelets with vessel subendothelium (SE) under flow conditions. Reconstituted blood containing washed platelets, purified von Willebrand factor (vWF) (1 U/mL), and normal washed red blood cells was exposed to de-endothelialized rabbit segments for 10 minutes at two different shear rates (800 and 1,600 seconds-1). In some experiments a monoclonal antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex (EDU3) was added to the perfusates. With normal platelets, the percentage of the vessel covered by platelets (%CS) was 23.1% +/- 3.7% at 800 seconds-1 and 30% +/- 4.3% at 1,600 seconds-1. Platelets were observed in contact or forming monolayers on vessel SE. EDU3 inhibited the spreading of normal platelets. The %CS (11.1% +/- 3.3%) was statistically decreased (P less than .01) and most of the platelets were observed in contact with the vessel surface. These data indicate that, under flow conditions, the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa can support the spreading of normal platelets in the absence of exogenous fibrinogen. Under the same experimental conditions, the interaction of uremic platelets with SE was markedly impaired at both shear rates studied (P less than .01 v normal platelets). The presence of EDU3 did not modify the interaction of uremic platelets. These results confirm the impairment of the platelet adhesion observed in uremic patients. Furthermore, they indicate the presence of a functional defect in the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa. The fact that perfusions with normal and uremic platelets in the presence of an antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex did not show any differences gives indirect evidence on a functionally normal interaction vWF/GPIb in uremic patients.\r"

  ".W": "The capacity to generate lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and the susceptibility of the neoplastic cells to both allogeneic and autologous LAK effectors were studied in B and T chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. While in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) the depressed natural killer function could be restored after a 7-day incubation with recombinant interleukin (IL-2), B-CLL mononuclear cells showed a reduced LAK activity compared with normal LAK cells. Furthermore, in all but 1 of the 20 B-CLL samples tested the leukemic cells were totally resistant to autologous LAK effectors. In most cases the leukemic cells were also resistant to normal allogeneic LAK cells. Competition experiments demonstrated that the patients' LAK cells, as well as normal LAK effectors, were capable of recognizing B-CLL cells, pointing, therefore, to a postbinding cytolytic defect. In hairy cell leukemia (HCL) an overall reduced LAK activity against allogeneic targets was documented, but, at variance from B-CLL, hairy cells were often susceptible to the lytic effect of normal LAK cells, and in half of the cases tested the neoplastic population was also sensitive in an autologous system. Similarly to B-CLL, in the great majority of T chronic lymphoproliferative disorders studied, the pathologic cells were resistant to normal and autologous LAK effectors and a defective LAK generation was found. These results demonstrate that in most B and T chronic leukemias the LAK function is defective and, when inducible, does not appear directed against the leukemic population. The possibility of exploiting an immunotherapeutic approach with IL-2/LAK cells in the management of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders does not gain support by these findings.\r"

  ".W": "We show that lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell precursors derived from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and cultured in the presence of recombinant interleukin-2 and normal human serum (NHS), develop into primarily NK cell-like (CD 57+) LAK cells, whereas identically prepared LAK cell precursors from normal subjects develop into mainly T cell-like (CD 3+, CD 8+) LAK cells. B-CLL LAK cells exhibited greater proliferative capacity than did normal LAK cells. When normal LAK cells were grown in B-CLL serum instead of NHS, their proliferation increased; NK cell levels also increased to those found in B-CLL LAK cells, suggesting that B-CLL serum contains a factor that promotes NK cell-like growth, LAK cells derived from normal or B-CLL patients demonstrated similar lytic activity toward K562 and Raji cells. Growth in B-CLL serum did not reduce their lytic potential. Thus, the altered phenotype and growth exhibited by B-CLL LAK cells and normal LAK cells grown in B-CLL serum does not lead to abnormalities in their cytolytic functions. We propose instead that the predominance of NK-like cells in B-CLL LAK cell populations and the presence of an NK cell-like growth factor in B-CLL serum reflect abnormalities related to NK cell-mediated B-cell regulation; ie, either inhibition of normal B-cell growth and/or growth stimulation of the leukemic clone in B-CLL.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a new rat immunoglobulin M monoclonal antibody (CH-F42) that recognizes a subset (1.5% to 8%) of normal peripheral blood T lymphocytes. The phenotype of these cells was determined, using dual-color immunofluorescence, to be CD2+, CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, CD7-, CD8-. They do not express T-cell activation markers, and are positive for UCHL1 (CD45RO), but negative for 2H4 (CD45RA). The antigen was expressed on circulating malignant cells in Sezary syndrome (four of four cases) and adult T-cell lymphoma-leukemia (ATLL) (four of six cases) and negative in a variety of other hematologic malignancies tested. These included chronic and acute lymphoid leukemias of B and T lineage, together with chronic and acute myeloid leukemias. However, normal CH-F42+ cells do not display any of the ultrastructural features associated with Sezary or ATLL cells. The marked similarities between these conditions together with the shared expression of an otherwise very restricted surface antigen (CH-F42) provide strong evidence for the existence of a common normal counterpart. Preliminary characterization studies of the antigen, which is also expressed by K562 and Jurkat cells, suggest the CH-F42 antigen is an O-linked, sialated glycan on a glycoprotein.\r"

The patient's cells and the cell line karyotype were 45,XX,-7,t(3;3)(q21;q26), typical of the syndrome of acute leukemia with high platelets. The cell line expresses CD34, CD7, TdT, and myeloid (CD13, CD14, CD33) and megakaryocyte/platelet (CD36, CD41, CD42b, CDw49b) antigens. In short-term culture, UCSD/AML1 cells proliferate in response to interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-4, IL-6, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), but not IL-1, IL-2, IL-5, or G-CSF. In long-term culture, proliferation can be sustained by GM-CSF, IL-6, or M-CSF. When maintained in GM-CSF, a small percentage of cells form multinucleated megakaryocyte-like giant cells. Culture with GM-CSF combined with IL-6, but not with IL-6 alone, increased giant cell formation fourfold to sevenfold. IL-6 alone or in combination with GM-CSF increased expression of platelet-related antigens. In contrast, culture with phorbol ester induced formation of macrophage-like cells. UCSD/AML1 is the first human acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cell line established from a patient with an acute leukemia syndrome associated with a specific chromosome abnormality.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma membrane receptors for the serum cobalamin-binding protein transcobalamin II (TCII) were identified on human leukemia K562 and HL-60 cells using immunoaffinity-purified human TCII labeled with [57Co]cyanocobalamin. The Bmax values for TCII receptors on proliferating K562 and HL-60 cells were 4,500 and 2,700 per cell, respectively. Corresponding dissociation constants (kd) were 8.0 x 10(-11) mol/L and 9.0 x 10(-11) mol/L. Rabbit TCII also bound to K562 and HL-60 cells but with slightly reduced affinities. Calcium was required for the binding of transcobalamin II to K562 cells. Brief treatment of these cells with trypsin resulted in almost total loss of surface binding activity. After removal of trypsin, surface receptors for TCII slowly reappeared, reaching pretrypsin treatment densities only after 24 hours. Reappearance of receptors was blocked by cycloheximide. TCII receptor densities on K562 and HL-60 cells correlated inversely with the concentration of cobalamin in the culture medium. This suggests that intracellular stores of cobalamin may affect the expression of transcobalamin receptors. Nonproliferating stationary-phase K562 cells had low TCII receptor densities (less than 1,200 receptors/cell). However, the density of TCII receptors increased substantially when cells were subcultured in fresh medium. Up-regulation of receptor expression coincided with increased 3H-thymidine incorporation, which preceded the resumption of cellular proliferation as measured by cell density. In the presence of cytosine arabinoside, which induces erythroid differentiation, K562 cells down-regulated expression of TCII receptors. When HL-60 cells were subcultured in fresh medium containing dimethysulfoxide to induce granulocytic differentiation, the up-regulation of TCII receptors was suppressed. This event occurred well before a diminution of 3H-thymidine incorporation and cessation of proliferation. Thus, changes in the regulation of expression of TCII receptors correlate with both the proliferative and differentiation status of cells.\r"

  ".W": "Centrocytic lymphomas are defined in the Kiel classification as B-cell lymphomas composed exclusively of cells resembling cleaved follicular center cells (FCC). These lymphomas have been shown to be histologically, immunophenotypically, and clinically distinct from other cleaved FCC lymphomas. DNA from 18 centrocytic lymphomas (14 patients) was analyzed using Southern blotting and probes for immunoglobulin heavy (JH) and kappa light chain (JK) joining gene, T-cell receptor beta chain constant gene (CB), bcl-1, bcl-2, and c-myc gene rearrangements. All of the lymphomas had JH and JK rearrangements, confirming their B-cell origin. None of the specimens had detectable CB, bcl-2, or c-myc rearrangements. However, 4 of 14 patients (28.6%) had rearrangement of the chromosome 11 bcl-1 locus. Therefore, centrocytic lymphomas are genotypically distinguishable from the majority of other small cleaved FCC lymphomas by their lack of demonstrable bcl-2 rearrangements. This supports the distinct nature of centrocytic lymphomas and suggests the lack of importance for the putative oncogene bcl-2 in these cases. Furthermore, the frequent rearrangement of bcl-1 suggests a possible role for this locus in the pathogenesis of at least some centrocytic lymphomas.\r"

We examined 32Dc13 cells, a murine neutrophil precursor cell line, by immunoprecipitation. Northern blot analysis, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy for the endogenous production of laminin. Our results demonstrate that 32Dc13 cells endogenously produce a laminin B2 chain protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) without producing any detectable A or B1 chain protein or mRNA. The B2 chain protein was not secreted by the cells; rather it could be detected on the cell surface after treatment of cells with neuraminidase. These findings suggest the possibility of a novel role for the laminin B2 chain in myeloid development and function.\r"

Other investigators have previously reported that TNF has been induced from macrophages by bacteria and, more recently, from natural killer cells by certain tumor cells. Our laboratory has reported that the opportunistic fungi, Candida albicans, can induce TNF, not only from human monocytes, but also from Percoll-fractionated large granular lymphocytes. We now report that incubation of PMN with C albicans for 3 hours was sufficient for detection of TNF release, and peak induction was observed at 8 to 18 hours. This release was inhibitable by actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, as well as by emetine and cycloheximide, which block protein synthesis. The TNF produced by PMN was neutralized by specific monoclonal antibodies against human TNF. These results represent an important finding that TNF production is a normal response of PMN to stimulation by fungi such as C albicans and suggest that the release of TNF may be related to autocrine activation of PMN effector function to control Candida growth.\r"

  ".W": "The generation of ABO hemagglutinins was used as a model to assess the tempo of reconstitution of antibody responses in recipients of elutriated (CCE) and nonelutriated (nonCCE) HLA matched bone marrow allografts. The study included 29 CCE recipients (10 major, 6 minor, and 1 major/minor ABO-mismatched, and 12 ABO-matched) and 40 nonCCE recipients (14 major, 12 minor, 2 major/minor, and 12 matched). Plasma volume in the graft and in blood product transfusions was uncorrelated with changes in hemagglutinin titers and therefore was excluded as a significant source of antibody. Removal of graft lymphocytes by CCE did not result in prolongation of host-derived hemagglutinins in recipients of major ABO-mismatched grafts. However, CCE resulted in a complete abrogation of the adoptive transfer of donor-derived antibody as detected in recipients of minor ABO-mismatched grafts. Despite the absence of adoptively transferred donor immunity in recipients of CCE grafts, they had hemagglutinin levels comparable with those of recipients of nonCCE grafts by 6 months after transplantation. This demonstrates that recipients of elutriated marrow were competent to mount de novo responses at that time. The strong correlation between donor pretransplant hemagglutinin titer and recipient titer 1 year after bone marrow transplantation in recipients of nonCCE grafts suggests that even late after transplant, antibody remains the product of adoptively transferred memory cells in recipients of grafts containing large numbers of mature lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Natural killer (NK) cells are reported to have an important role in the resistance of lethally irradiated recipients to bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Therefore, we investigated the effects of recipient NK depletion on survival, chimerism, and hematopoietic reconstitution after lethal irradiation and the transplantation of limiting amounts of T-cell-deficient bone marrow (BM). When administered before BMT, anti-asialo GM1 (ASGM1) antiserum treatment, effective in depleting in vivo NK activity, was associated with a marked increase in survival in 3 of 3 allogeneic combinations (BALB/c into C3H/HeN, C57B1/6, or C3B6F1). This enhanced survival was independent of the susceptibility of each recipient strain to accept BALB/c BM. Moreover, recipient anti-ASGM1 treatment was also effective in increasing survival in recipients of syngeneic BM, suggesting that NK cells can adversely affect engraftment independent of genetically controlled polymorphic cell surface determinants. Analysis of chimerism in surviving animals 2 months post-BMT showed that recipient NK depletion significantly increased the level of donor engraftment when high doses of BM were transplanted. These studies also demonstrated that anti-ASGM1 pretreatment mainly resulted in an increase in extramedullary hematopoiesis in the second and third week after irradiation. Anti-ASGM1 treatment also dramatically accelerated the rate of appearance of donor-derived cells with a higher level of donor-cell engraftment apparent at a time when the differences in survival between NK-depleted and control BMT recipients became significant. Peripheral cell counts were also affected by NK depletion, with significantly enhanced platelet and red blood cell recovery and a moderate increase in granulocyte recovery. The overall favorable influence of anti-ASGM1 recipient treatment on hematopoietic events post-BMT suggests that, in humans, pretransplant regimens aimed toward NK depletion should be evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "In 1,814 patients with sickle cell disease who had been transfused, the overall rate of alloimmunization to erythrocyte antigens was 18.6%. The rate of alloimmunization in this group appears to be an explicit function of the number of transfusions received because it increases exponentially with increasing numbers of transfusions. Alloimmunization usually occurred with less than 15 transfusions, although the rate of alloimmunization continued to increase when more transfusions were given. The rate of alloimmunization was less in patients with hemoglobin SC disease and sickle-beta+ thalassemia because these patients had received fewer transfusions. Children less than 10 years old had a slightly lower rate of alloimmunization than patients in other age groups even after correction for the number of transfusions given. Women were more frequently alloimmunized than men; this was largely due to the fact that women received more transfusions than men, but in the age group 16 to 20 years the increase may have been due in part to alloimmunization owing to pregnancy. Forty-five percent of those alloimmunized made antibodies of only one specificity; 17% made four or more antibodies reacting with different antigens. Antibodies to the C and E antigens of the Rh group, the Kell antigen, and the Lewis antigens were most commonly made. These findings may be important in formulating a rational transfusion policy in sickle cell disease.\r"

  ".W": "Leukoagglutinins are implicated in transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). In the present study, severe lung vascular leakage was reproduced by application of a leukoagglutinating antibody of anti-5b specificity in an ex vivo lung model. The antibody originated from a multiparous donor-plasma, observed to cause noncardiogenic edema during transfusion therapy. Heated full plasma (anti-5b-titer 1/128) or purified immunoglobulin G fraction was used for the studies. Ex vivo isolated rabbit lungs were perfused with albumin buffer, and human granulocytes (PMN) were admixed to the recirculating perfusate. In presence of anti-5b antibody plus 5b-positive PMN plus rabbit plasma as complement-source, severe lung edema occurred after a latent period of 3 to 6 hours. Pulmonary artery pressure was only transiently and moderately increased, and the leakage reaction could be traced back to a several-fold increase in lung vascular permeability. In contrast, no vascular leakage was noted in lungs perfused in the absence of anti-5b antibody, PMN, or rabbit plasma. Moreover, no permeability increase occurred on use of 5b-negative PMN. This reproduction of TRALI in an ex vivo lung model corroborates the role of leukoagglutinating antibodies in initiating PMN-dependent respiratory distress and suggests a contribution of concomitant complement activation.\r"

  ".U": "91002901\r", 
  ".W": "Virtually all cases of childhood ALL have chromosomal abnormalities and half contain translocations, which are nearly equally divided between random and nonrandom rearrangements. Nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities have been correlated with leukemic cell lineage, the degree of cell differentiation, and the specific gene involved at the molecular level. Many cytogenetic findings have prognostic significance; however, the adverse influence of certain changes, including most chromosomal translocations, may in fact be offset by the greater cytoreductive effects of intensified therapy. Table 4 summarizes the relation of selected karyotypic findings to treatment outcome in patients treated on contemporary protocols. Among all of the chromosomal abnormalities identified in childhood ALL, hyperdiploidy greater than 50 has been associated with the most favorable prognosis. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the treatment outcome for patients with classical Ph+ or hypodiploid ALL is very poor even in programs of intensive chemotherapy; alternative treatment such as bone marrow transplantation should be considered for such patients. Cases with the t(4;11)(q21;q23) also have a very poor clinical outcome, but the adverse prognosis may be limited to the infant or adolescent age groups. The prognostic significance of other nonrandom translocations, such as t(1;19)(q23;p13) and several other abnormalities, needs to be further assessed in larger numbers of patients. Finally, as more is learned about the molecular pathology underlying these rearrangements, it may be possible to develop new therapeutic agents that are specifically targeted to interfere with the aberrant gene products expressed by human leukemic cells.\r"

  ".U": "91002902\r", 
  ".W": "We have reviewed results of therapy in 740 patients with grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic marrow transplantation. At the beginning of therapy, 597 patients (81%) had rash, 369 (50%) had liver dysfunction and 396 (54%) had gut dysfunction. Initial treatment was with glucocorticoids (n = 531), cyclosporine (n = 170), antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (n = 156) or monoclonal antibody (n = 3) either singly (n = 633) or in combination (n = 107). Parameters of GVHD severity in each organ were recorded weekly, and evaluation of response was made using values at the initiation of secondary treatment or, for patients without such treatment, using values on day 29 of primary treatment or the last recorded value before death, whichever occurred first. Minimal criteria for improvement or progression were defined for each organ, but no attempt was made to define liver or gut outcome if another complication such as venocclusive disease or infectious enteritis was present. Improvement rates were 43% for skin disease, 35% for evaluable liver disease and 50% for evaluable gut disease. Overall complete or partial responses were seen in 44% of patients. Multivariate analyses were carried out to identify patient, disease or treatment factors associated with likelihood of overall improvement and likelihood of response in at least one organ. A similar analysis was also carried out to identify covariates associated with time to treatment failure (defined as initiation of secondary therapy or death not due to relapse of malignancy). In all three models, GVHD prophylaxis using cyclosporine combined with methotrexate was associated with favorable GVHD treatment outcome compared to prophylaxis with either agent alone, and treatment with glucocorticoids or cyclosporine was more successful than treatment with ATG. Other factors associated with unfavorable outcome in the model of time to treatment failure and also entered in one of the response models were recipient HLA disparity with the donor, presence of a liver complication other than GVHD, and early onset of GVHD. Results of this analysis indicate that glucocorticoids represent the best initial therapy available for treatment of acute GVHD, although much room for improvement remains.\r"

In mice injected three times a day for 6 days with 12,000 to 120,000 U rGM-CSF, no significant modification of both platelet levels and mean platelet volume was observed, while there was a twofold increase in blood neutrophils.

A significant dose-related increase in the number of splenic megakaryocytes occurred in mice receiving 60,000 to 120,000 U rGM-CSF, while a slight increase in the number of bone marrow megakaryocytes was observed in mice injected with 120,000 U rGM-CSF. The proportion of bone marrow megakaryocytes with a size less than 18 microns and greater than 35 microns resulted significantly higher in mice receiving rGM-CSF in comparison with controls; an increase in the percentage of splenic megakaryocytes greater than 35 microns was also observed. A statistically significant increase in the total spleen content of CFU-Meg was observed after administration of 90,000 and 120,000 U rGM-CSF three times a day for 6 days, while no effect on bone marrow CFU-Meg was recorded, irrespective of the dose delivered. Finally, 24 hours after a single intravenous injection of rGM-CSF, there was a significant increase in the proportion of CFU-Meg in S-phase, with the splenic progenitors being more sensitive than bone marrow-derived CFU-Meg. These data indicate that rGM-CSF has in vivo megakaryocyte stimulatory activity, and are consistent with previous in vitro observations. However, an effective stimulation of megakaryocytopoiesis in vivo, bringing about an increase in the levels of blood platelets, may require interaction of rGM-CSF with other cytokines.\r"

  ".U": "91002904\r", 
  ".W": "Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) blasts have been shown to produce a variety of cytokines in culture such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, granulocyte-, macrophage-, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha). Using two sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IL-1 beta and GM-CSF, we document in the present study that the production of the two cytokines by AML blasts in culture is coordinated. First, we observe a striking correlation between the levels of GM-CSF and IL-1 beta released by the cells. Thus, a high production of IL-1 beta is always concordant with a high production of GM-CSF and, conversely, low production of IL-1 beta is concordant with low levels of GM-CSF. Second, neutralization of intrinsic IL-1 using antibodies that are specific for IL-1 alpha and -1 beta suppresses the release of GM-CSF by the cells. Third, neutralization of the endogenous source of IL-1 also results in an abrogation of GM-CSF mRNA. Fourth, the production of both IL-1 beta and GM-CSF is up-regulated by exposing AML blasts to an exogenous source of IL-1, suggesting a positive regulation of autocrine growth factor production. Taken together, our results indicate that GM-CSF production by AML blasts is mediated by endogenously produced IL-1. Both IL-1 beta and -1 alpha are produced by AML blasts, although IL-1 beta appears to be more abundant. Spontaneous colony formation by AML blasts is abrogated by the addition of neutralizing antibodies against IL-1 beta and GM-CSF, whereas each antibody alone has little effect on blast proliferation. Taken together, our results are consistent with the view that the production of IL-1 beta by AML blasts supports autocrine growth in culture, through induction of CSFs or other cytokines that stimulate blast proliferation.\r"

Moreover zidovudine, an anti-retroviral drug used to treat AIDS patients has myelosuppressive side effects. Therefore treatment with IL-3, a multi-lineage hemopoietic growth factor may be beneficial for zidovudine-treated individuals. In this study we examined the effect of IL-3 on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) expression. The proliferative response to rIL-3 and the effects on the replication of the monocytotropic HIV variant, HTLV-III Ba-L, in the absence or presence of the anti-retroviral drug zidovudine was studied in purified human peripheral blood monocytes. Zidovudine concentrations sufficient for complete inhibition of HIV replication did not affect rIL-3 induced monocyte proliferation. Although rIL-3, like rGM-CSF, was able to augment HIV expression in monocytes, it did not interfere with the anti-retroviral activity of zidovudine. These data indicate that rIL-3 is a potential candidate for use in myelosupportive therapy in AIDS patients treated with anti-retroviral drugs.\r"

Recombinant hIL3 at doses of 60 to 500 micrograms/m2 was administered by subcutaneous bolus injection for 15 days to 13 patients with solid tumors and preserved hematopoietic function and to nine patients with bone marrow failure, including five with myelodysplastic syndromes. Following treatment with rhIL3, the percentage of actively cycling BM erythroid (BFU-E) and multilineage (CFU-GEMM) progenitors in patients with preserved hematopoietic function increased from 16% to 36% (P less than .05) and from 10% to 40% (P less than .01), respectively. The DNA-synthesis rates of early and late granulocyte macrophage progenitor cells increased from 11% to 26% (CFU-GM day 14; P less than .02) and from 13% to 30% (CFU-GM day 7; P less than .05). There was an increase in BM cellularity from 37% to 58%, and of the myeloid to erythroid ratio from 1.4 to 3.2, while the concentration of marrow progenitors on a per cell basis was unchanged or slightly decreased. The frequencies of blast cells in the BM were unchanged. Mean levels of PB CFU-GM day 14 and CFU-GEMM were 100% and 72% above baseline values after 7 days of rhIL3 but only 25% and 28% above initial levels at the end of treatment. Peripheral blood BFU-E were reduced in the majority of patients with normal marrow after both 7 and 15 days of rhIL3. No augmentation of circulating BFU-E and CFU-GEMM was seen in 5 patients with MDS who had few or no PB BFU-E or CFU-GEMM initially. Total leukocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil counts increased significantly (P less than .01) in 21 of 22 patients with a peak response after a median of 13 days of rhIL3. While a small increase in reticulocytes was not accompanied by an elevation of the hemoglobin or hematocrit, platelet counts increased by 50% in patients with preserved marrow function. Thus, rhIL3 induces a multilineage response in vivo, apparently by stimulating proliferation of multipotential and lineage-restricted progenitors. It remains to be determined whether this is due to direct or indirect effects on the progenitor cells.\r"

We have used (1) immunofluorescence procedures and flow cytometry, and (2) immunogold staining and electron microscopy to investigate this phenomenon. Washed platelets were incubated with alpha-thrombin, adenosine diphosphate, or ionophore A23187 for increasing lengths of time. For alpha-thrombin, but not the other agonists, flow cytometry confirmed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the binding of MoAbs specific for GP Ib alpha (AP-1, Bx-1), GP IX (FMC 25), or to the complex itself (SZ 1). Immunoglold staining performed using standard transmission or scanning electron microscopy high-lighted surface areas devoid of bound antibody. However, a quantitatively normal immunofluorescence was restored if paraformaldehyde-fixed, thrombin-stimulated platelets were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO) before MoAb addition, while immunogold staining was now seen to be concentrated within the interior of the platelet. Glutaraldehyde-fixed samples were then embedded in the resin Lowicryl K4M (Taab Laboratories Equipment Ltd, Aldermaston, England) and immunogold staining performed on thin sections using a polyclonal antibody to glycocalicin. An increased presence of GP Ib-IX complexes within surface-connected membrane systems of the thrombin-stimulated platelets was confirmed. Interestingly, GP Ib-IX movement was opposite to the thrombin-induced externalization of internal pools of GP IIb-IIIa complexes and of the alpha-granule membrane GP, GMP-140.\r"

As assessed by an immunologic assay specific for human PAI-1, guanidine HCI activated HT1080 PAI-1 and rPAI-1 entered the total plasma volume following intravenous bolus administration and exhibited a biphasic clearance pattern. The t1/2s of HT1080 PAI-1 for the initial and beta phases equalled 6.0 and 24.8 minutes, respectively. The t1/2s of rPAI-1 for the initial and beta phases equalled 8.8 and 34.0 minutes, respectively. Similar results were obtained by measuring PAI-1 activity in plasma and with trace amounts of 125I-rPAI-1, suggesting that the above pharmacokinetic behavior could also apply to endogenous PAI-1. The liver was the main site of rPAI-1 clearance. Unactivated, latent PAI-1 exhibited a very different pharmacokinetic profile. Over 80% of latent rPAI-1 cleared from the circulation within 10 minutes (t1/2 = 1.7 minutes). The difference in clearance behavior between activated and latent PAI-1 may be related to the ability of activated PAI-1, but not latent PAI-1, to rapidly form high-molecular-weight complexes with plasma binding factors which were observed in vitro and in vivo. Because PAI-1 could potentially tilt the fibrinolytic balance toward a prothrombotic state, its rapid clearance may represent an important control mechanism governing the circulating levels of this key component of the fibrinolytic pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Human antithrombin III (AT-III) cDNA was cloned into the cell-free expression phagemid vector pGEM-3Zf(+) and site-directed mutagenesis was used to remove nucleotides encoding the signal peptide. AT-III messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts derived from this construct were translated in an mRNA-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) system containing (35S)methionine. Immunoprecipitation of the cell-free translation mixture with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to AT-III showed, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a 47-Kd polypeptide which is the non-glycosylated mature form of plasma AT-III. Densitometric scanning showed that this polypeptide constitutes greater than 90% of the radiolabeled polypeptides produced in this system. Heparin-Sepharose chromatography resulted in the elution of cell-free derived AT-III as a broad peak between 0.2 and 0.7 mol/L NaCl. The cell-free derived AT-III also reacted with human alpha-thrombin. In 2 minutes approximately 20% of the AT-III was found associated with a higher molecular weight species, consistent with the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric covalent complex between alpha-thrombin and AT-III. Unfractionated heparin accelerated the rate of formation of such complexes. When Ser394 was mutated to Leu to form the AT-III Denver mutant, the cell-free translation product of this mutation did not show any significant complex formation when reacted with alpha-thrombin. A truncated form of AT-III (Met251-Lys432), containing only the putative thrombin-binding domain, was synthesized independently. This 21-Kd polypeptide did not bind heparin; however, it was cleaved by alpha-thrombin presumably at the reactive center Arg393-Ser394. When Ser394 was mutated to Leu the cell-free translation product of this truncated AT-III mutation did not react with alpha-thrombin at the reactive center. This simple cell-free approach, along with site-directed mutagenesis, should allow for the rapid and accurate mapping of the functional domains of human AT-III.\r"

  ".W": "Factor IX is a multidomain protein essential for hemostasis. We describe a mutation in a patient affecting the first epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of the protein. All exons and the promoter region of the gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction method, and sequenced. Only a single mutation (C----G), that predicts the substitution of Pro55 by Ala in the first EGF domain was found in the patient's gene. This mutation leads to new restriction sites for four enzymes. One new site (Nsi) was tested in the amplified exon IV fragment and was shown to provide a rapid and reliable marker for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis in the affected family. The factor IX protein, termed factor IXHollywood (IXHW), was isolated to homogeneity from the patient's plasma. As compared with normal factor IX (IXN), IXHW contained the same amount of gamma-carboxy glutamic acid but twice the amount of beta-OH aspartic acid. Both IXHW and IXN contained no detectable free -SH groups. Further, IXHW could be readily cleaved to yield a factor IXa-like molecule by factor Xla/Ca2+. However, IXaHW (compared with IXaN) activated factor X approximately twofold slower in the presence of Ca2+ and phospholipid (PL), and 8- to 12-fold slower in the presence of Ca2+, PL, and factor VIIIa. Additionally, IXaHW had only approximately 10% of the activity of IXaN in an aPTT assay. In agreement with the nuclear magnetic resonance-derived structure of EGF, the Chou-Fasman algorithm strongly predicted a beta turn involving residues Asn-Pro55-Cys-Leu in IXN. Replacement of Pro55 by Ala gave a fourfold decrease in the beta turn probability for this peptide, suggesting a change(s) in the secondary structure in the EGF domain of IXHW. Since this domain of IXN is thought to have one high-affinity Ca2+ binding site and may be involved in PL and/or factor VIIIa binding, the localized secondary structural changes in IXHW could lead to distortion of the binding site(s) for the cofactor(s) and, thus, a dysfunctional molecule.\r"

Infusion of thromboplastin into the rabbit caused a rapid increase of radioactivity over the lungs, possibly due to the accumulation of 125I fibrin in the lungs, followed by a rapid decline of radioactivity, suggestive of removal of fibrin from the lungs. Thromboplastin also caused a rapid decrease of systemic fibrinogen that was accompanied by a lengthening of the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. The effect of coinfusion of rLACI with thromboplastin or bolus injection of rLACI before thromboplastin infusion was studied. At a high dose of rLACI (800 micrograms/kg body weight), the thromboplastin-induced radioactivity increase in the lungs and the systemic fibrinogen decrease were completely suppressed. The activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time of the plasma samples lengthened, possibly due to the presence of thromboplastin in circulation. The thromboplastin-induced radioactivity increase over the lungs was not completely suppressed by lower doses of rLACI (135 to 270 micrograms/kg body weight), but these doses of rLACI prevented systemic fibrinogen decrease. At a bolus dose of 23 micrograms/kg body weight, rLACI provided 50% protection of the fibrinogen consumption (fibrinogen decreased to 82% compared with 65% in rabbits treated with thromboplastin alone). These results show that rLACI is effective in the inhibition of thromboplastin-induced coagulation in vivo.\r"

When added together to platelets, these antibodies prevent adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation, despite normal fibrinogen binding (Newman et al, Blood 69:668, 1987). To explore the cellular requirements of aggregation after fibrinogen binding, we used several techniques to study platelets treated with Tab and AP3, then stimulated with ADP. We used scanning and transmission electron microscopy to evaluate platelet morphology, immunolabel-surface replication to determine whether individual GPIIb-IIIa complexes clustered, immunocytochemistry on frozen thin sections to study the subcellular distribution of the integrin GPIIb-IIIa and fibrinogen, and biochemical methods to assess the activation of the platelet cytoskeleton. We found that the treated cells had short, blunted projections instead of normal filopodia. Other morphologic abnormalities, apparent in thin section, were aberrantly placed alpha-granules and microtubules, and a prominent, worm-like, fibrinogen-filled surface-connected canalicular system. Biochemical analysis suggested that such platelets undergo massive actomyosin-controlled membrane flow, which serves to sequester GPIIb-IIIa and makes the platelets refractory to aggregation. We conclude that aggregation requires the formation of long, slender filopodia, probably directed by cytoskeletal rearrangements after activation, and that the transmembrane GPIIb-IIIa complex may play a role in signaling these events.\r"

The effect of rhGM-CSF therapy on the lymphocyte phenotype; on the proliferative responses to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin, Candida albicans, and tetanus toxoid antigens; and on the natural killer (NK) activity of the circulating lymphocytes was studied. Samples were collected before (baseline) and twice during the rhGM-CSF administration. The absolute number of circulating lymphocytes remained relatively constant during the first period, but experienced a significant increase (P less than .001) during the second period. The increase was most prominent in the B cells (P less than .001), but the T cells (P less than .016) also increased. Detailed investigation of lymphocyte subsets showed an increase of the markers CD38 (Leu17), HLA-DR, and the transferrin receptor throughout the treatment course giving evidence of lymphoid cell activation. The NK cell activity was suppressed (P less than .008) throughout the treatment. However, proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, Candida antigen, and tetanus toxoid were unaffected. Although the mechanism is not yet defined, GM-CSF does induce activation and increase in absolute lymphoid cell number, especially B cells, together with a decrease in NK cytotoxicity. The implication of these immune cell changes in relation to host resistance to microorganisms remains to be established.\r"

  ".W": "A new recurring chromosome abnormality was identified in 8 of 621 consecutive successfully karyotyped adults with de novo acute leukemia. These eight patients had trisomy 13 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality. On central morphologic review, five cases were classified as subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia, one as acute mixed lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, one as acute lymphoid leukemia, and one as acute undifferentiated leukemia. Blasts of all eight cases expressed one or more myeloid differentiation antigens. Three also expressed T-lineage-associated antigens; however, none of these had rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta, gamma, or delta genes. Four of six cases tested were TdT positive. All eight patients with trisomy 13 were treated with intensive induction chemotherapy; only three entered a short-lived complete remission. Survival of patients with trisomy 13 ranged from 0.5 to 14.7 months, and was significantly shorter than that of the remaining patients (median 9.5 v 16.2 months, P = .007). We conclude that trisomy 13 is a rare, recurring clonal chromosome abnormality in acute leukemia associated with a poor prognosis. Malignant transformation of an immature hematopoietic precursor cell is suggested by the expression of antigens characteristic of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineage, the high incidence of TdT positivity, and the morphologic heterogeneity in these leukemias.\r"

Many of the relevant antigens and most of the relevant enzyme histochemical activities are destroyed and others are less than optimally preserved in tissues embedded in hot paraffin. Most enzymatic activities and antigens are well preserved in tissues embedded at 4 degrees C in glycol methacrylate (GMA). The measurement of DNA content in neoplastic cells with the most commonly employed techniques depended on the availability of fresh suspensions of cells until the development by Hedley of methods that permit the recovery of nuclei from paraffin blocks for this purpose. In order to facilitate the analysis of antigens, enzymatic markers, and DNA from the same sample of tissue, we have developed a means of recovery of nuclei from GMA-embedded tissues. Twenty-microns-thick sections of GMA-embedded tonsil were either pretreated with an organic solvent (absolute ethanol or 2-ethoxyethanol) followed by rehydration in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or directly rehydrated in PBS. The suspensions were formed mechanically by gentle sonication. The type of fixative and length of PBS rehydration were varied. Tissue fixed in 100% acetone, embedded in GMA, and rehydrated directly in PBS for six days gave the highest average yield of nuclei, 3.7 x 10(7) nuclei per gram tissue. In order to assess DNA binding of fluorescent dyes, 2-microns-thick GMA sections were stained with chromomycin, Hoechst 33342 (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO), and propidium iodide. Hoechst 33342 bound specifically to the nuclei with low background staining.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the biologic significance of the structural rearrangements of the long arm of chromosome 6(6q) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis, we studied 412 consecutive children whose leukemic cell chromosomes had been completely banded and identified 45 (11%) children with this abnormality. The 45 cases were divided into del(6q) only (n = 11), del(6q) and numerical abnormalities (n = 4), del(6q) and structural abnormalities (n = 23), and 6q translocations (n = 7). The breakpoints of del(6q) were subgrouped: del(6)(q15q21) in 11 cases, del(6) (q13q21) in six, del(6)(q21q23) in four, del(6)(q15) in four, del(6)(q15q23) in three, and other deletions in 10 cases. Notably, all these deletions encompassed the 6q21 band, suggesting that this might be the locus of a recessive tumor suppressor gene, the absence of which contributes to malignant transformation or proliferation. Among the seven children with 6q translocations, a previously unidentified nonrandom translocation, t(6;12)(q21;p13) was noted in two cases with an early pre-B immunophenotype. Clinical features and event-free survival were similar among children with or without 6q abnormalities. Overall, children with 6q abnormalities were less likely than those without the abnormality to have a pre-B immunophenotype (P = .03). T-cell immunophenotypes were equally represented in cases with or without 6q abnormalities. However, all four children with del(6q) and a 12p abnormality had early pre-B ALL and all three children with del(6q) and a 9p abnormality had a T-cell immunophenotype. The lack of specificity for a particular immunophenotype may imply that the gene or genes affected by 6q abnormalities are broadly active in the multistep process of lymphoid leukemogenesis. The relatively high frequency of microscopically visible del(6q) indicates the need for molecular studies to identify cases with submicroscopic deletions.\r"

  ".U": "91002924\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated the effects of recombinant C5a (rC5a) on gene expression and synthesis of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Total (cell-associated and secreted) cytokine synthesis was measured. In the strict absence of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), rC5a resulted in a small but statistically insignificant increase in immunoreactive IL-1 beta and TNF, as well as in IL-1 and IL-6 bioactivity. On the other hand, rC5a induced marked transcriptional activation of IL-1 beta and TNF in a dose-dependent fashion with an optimal concentration of 50 ng/mL. The rC5a-induced cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) was not spontaneously translated into protein. At 50 ng/mL, rC5a induced the same levels of mRNA for IL-1 beta and TNF as 1 ng/mL of LPS, whereas LPS induced 12 times more IL-1 beta protein and 70 times more TNF protein than rC5a alone. The C5a-induced mRNA half-life was the same as that induced by LPS. Formyl-Meth-Leu-Phe (fMLP) did not induce cytokine transcription. Pretreatment with rC5a enhanced cytokine synthesis induced by other stimuli. After 2 hours of preincubation with rC5a, PBMC synthesized 3 to 10 times more IL-1 beta and TNF on subsequent stimulation by LPS or IL-1 itself. We conclude that rC5a provides primarily a transcriptional but not translational signal for IL-1 beta and TNF; the half-life of the untranslated mRNA is the same as that of translated message; rC5a-induced transcription upregulates PBMC for enhanced synthesis of these cytokines; and a translational signal can be provided by LPS or IL-1 itself.\r"

  ".U": "91002925\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that many neutrophil (PMN) characteristics are heterogeneous but the origin of PMN heterogeneity is unknown. It is unclear if PMN functional heterogeneity is secondary to maturational differences or due to distinct subpopulations of cells that possess different functional capacities. The PMN 31D8 antigen is a useful probe for evaluation of PMN subpopulations. The majority of PMNs (approximately 85%) exhibit a high intensity fluorescence after 31D8 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) labeling (31D8 enriched or \"bright\" PMNs) as determined by flow cytometric analysis. These cells are more functional than cells with low intensity fluorescence (31D8 diminished or \"dull\" PMNs). Various immunologic, clonogenic and functional techniques were used to study the expression of the 31D8 antigen in HL-60 cells and myeloid cells in order to evaluate antigenic and functional heterogeneity during morphologic maturation. The results of this study indicate that the percentage of 31D8 antigen positive (31D8 antigen enriched and diminished) bone marrow cells increases from 20 +/- 11% in myeloblast cells to 68 +/- 10% in promyelocytes, 93 +/- 2% in myelocytes and 99 +/- 1% in bands and PMNs. 31D8 antigen enriched cells first appear at the myelocyte stage (32 +/- 10%) and increase in bands (52 +/- 13%), marrow PMNs (62 +/- 13%) and peripheral blood PMNs (88 +/- 4%). These data indicate that the heterogeneous expression of 31D8 antigen in PMNs is due, at least in part, to maturational differences within the PMN population and raise the possibility that other heterogeneously expressed PMN characteristics are also maturationally derived. They also suggest that 31D8 antigenic expression may be a more precise indicator of myeloid functional maturation than maturation as identified by cellular morphology.\r"

In the majority of patients, except for those who developed chronic graft-versus-host disease, the number of circulating CD20+ B cell normalized by the fourth posttransplant month. The earliest detectable B cells normally expressed HLA-DR, CD19, surface immunoglobulin (slg), CD21, Leu-8, and lacked expression of CD10 (CALLA). In addition, the circulating B cells expressed CD1c, CD38, CD5, and CD23 for the first year following transplant, antigens that are normally expressed on a small percentage of circulating B cells in normal adults, but highly expressed on cord blood B cells. Similar to cord blood B cells, patient B cells isolated during the first year following transplant, proliferated normally to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SAC), and produced IgM, but minimal or no IgG when stimulated with pokeweed mitogen and SAC, unlike normal adult B cells that produce both. The similar phenotype and function of posttransplant and cord blood B cells, and their similar rate of decline in patients and normal children adds further evidence to support the hypothesis that B-cell differentiation posttransplant is recapitulating normal B-cell ontogeny.\r"

All 10 rabbits transfused with 10 to 0.1 mL and 1 of 2 rabbits transfused with 0.01 mL seroconverted for HTLV-I after 2 to 4 weeks. HTLV-I-producing lymphoid cell lines of recipient origin were established from one seroconverted rabbit of each aliquot group. To determine the ability of passive immunization to protect against HTLV-I infection, two groups of three rabbits were first transfused with 5 mL of blood from the same virus-infected rabbit and then infused after 24 or 48 hours with 10 mL of HTLV-I immune globulin (77 mg/mL of IgG) prepared from seropositive healthy persons. None of the 24-hour immunization group seroconverted for HTLV-I during the observation period of six months; however, all of the 48-hour immunization group became seropositive after 2 to 4 weeks. These results indicate that HTLV-I can be transmitted with as little as 0.01 mL of virus-infected blood, and that passive immunization is effective in preventing cell-to-cell infection of HTLV-I when given within 24 hours of transfusion of virus-infected blood.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess whether the threat of unemployment affects risk factors for cardiovascular disease. DESIGN--Longitudinal study of a cohort of middle aged shipyard workers followed up for a mean of 6.2 (SD 1.9) years and a group of controls observed for the same period. The first investigation took place during a period of relative economic stability for the shipyard and the second during the phase of its closure. SETTING--An age cohort health screening programme in Malmo, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS--715 Male shipyard workers and 261 age matched male controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in 19 variables related to the risk of cardiovascular disease, and psychological variables, alcohol consumption, smoking, and dietary habits as assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS--Serum cholesterol concentrations increased more (mean 0.25 (SD 0.68) mmol/l v 0.08 (0.66) mmol/l) and serum calcium concentrations decreased less (-0.06 (0.10) mmol/l v -0.08 (0.09) mmol/l) in the shipyard workers than in the controls. A correlation was found between scores for sleep disturbance and changes in serum cholesterol concentration. In the whole series there was a greater increase in serum cholesterol concentrations among men threatened with unemployment (437/976; 44.8%) than among those who were not. In stepwise regression analysis the change in serum cholesterol concentration was correlated with changes in haemoglobin concentration, body weight, and serum triglyceride and calcium concentrations. A positive correlation was found between change in cholesterol concentration and change in blood pressure, indicating that the overall risk profile had worsened among men with increased serum cholesterol concentrations. CONCLUSIONS--Risk of unemployment increases the serum cholesterol concentration in middle aged men, the increase being more pronounced in those with sleep disturbance. The increase in serum cholesterol is related to changes in other established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These findings might partly explain the excessive mortality due to cardiovascular disease recorded among the unemployed and people with sleep disturbance.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective intervention study with six weeks' follow up. Patients received one of three drug regimens in order of entry. SETTING--Primary care hospital and secondary girls' school in rural western Kenya. PATIENTS--158 of 988 pregnant women (89 primigravid and 69 multigravid) in the third trimester and 105 of 1488 non-pregnant schoolgirls of reproductive age were parasitaemic (more than 500 asexual forms/microliter. These women were divided into three treatment groups by gravid state. INTERVENTIONS--Women were treated with chloroquine base 25 mg/kg over three days or pyrimethamine 75 mg and sulfadoxine 1500 mg as a single dose or chlorproguanil 1.2 mg/kg and dapsone 2.4 mg/kg as a single dose. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Parasitaemia and haemoglobin concentrations measured at seven day intervals for six weeks. RESULTS--Primigravid women were more likely to be parasitaemic on follow up than multigravidas or nulligravidas, whose response was about the same. Parasites did not clear by day 7 in primigravidas in six (20%) of 30 who received chloroquine, three (8%) of 35 treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine, and none of 23 treated with chlorproguanil and dapsone. At day 28, 83%, 19%, and 67% of primigravidas in these treatment groups were parasitaemic. Haemoglobin concentrations rose in all women, but improvement was sustained only in women who remained free of parasites. CONCLUSIONS--Clearance of parasites was better with either pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine or chlorproguanil and dapsone than with chloroquine. Longest protection was obtained with pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study delays between sending referral letters and the outpatient appointment and to assess the content of referral and reply letters, their educational value, and the extent to which questions asked are answered by reply letters. DESIGN--Retrospective review of referrals to 16 consultant orthopaedic surgeons at five hospitals, comprising 288 referral letters with corresponding replies, by scoring contents of letters. SETTING--Orthopaedic teaching hospitals in Nottingham, Derby, and Mansfield. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Weighted scores of contents of referral and reply letters, assessment of their educational value, and responses to questions in referral letters. RESULTS--Median outpatient delay was 23.4 weeks. There was no significant decrease in waiting time if the referral letter was marked \"urgent\" but a significantly greater delay (p less than 0.01) if referrals were directed to an unnamed consultant. The content score was generally unsatisfactory for both referrals and replies, and there was no correlation for the content scores of the referral letter and its reply (r = 0.13). Items of education were rare in the referral letters (8/288; 3%) and significantly more common in replies (75/288; 26%) (p much less than 0.001). Senior registrars were significantly more likely to attempt education than other writers (p less than 0.02). Education in replies was significantly related to increased length of the letter (p less than 0.05) and was more likely to occur if the referral was addressed to a named consultant (p less than 0.03). 48 (17%) Referral letters asked questions, of which 21 (44%) received a reply. No factor was found to influence the asking of or replying to questions. CONCLUSIONS--The potential for useful communication in the referral letter and in the reply from orthopaedic surgeons is being missed at a number of levels. The content is often poor, the level of mutual education is low, and the use of the referral letter to determine urgency is deficient. Most questions asked by general practitioners are not answered.\r"

DESIGN--Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING--General practices in inner London and Devon. SUBJECTS--859 General practitioners, 609 (71%) of whom returned the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of rectal examinations done each month; the indication score, derived from answers to a question asking whether the respondent would do a rectal examination for various symptoms; and the confidence score, which indicated the respondent's confidence in the diagnosis made on rectal examination. RESULTS--279 General practitioners did five or fewer rectal examinations each month and 96 did more than 10 each month. Factors significantly associated with doing fewer rectal examinations were a small partnership and being a female general practitioner, and the expectation that the examination would be repeated. Lack of time in the surgery, and a waiting time of less than two weeks for an urgent outpatient appointment were also important. General practitioners were deterred from doing rectal examinations by reluctance of the patient (278), the expectation that the examination would be repeated (141), and lack of time (123) or a chaperone (39). Confidence in diagnosis was significantly associated with doing more rectal examinations, the perception of having been well taught to do a rectal examination at medical school, and being a male general practitioner. CONCLUSIONS--Factors other than clinical judgment influence the frequency of rectal examination in general practice. Rectal examination may become commoner with the trend towards larger group practices and if diagnostic confidence is increased and greater emphasis put on rectal examination in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of reproductive history and risk behaviour of women positive for HIV antibody and prediction of detection by screening on the basis of blood group samples, Guthrie tests, and rubella tests. SETTING--City of Dundee, where the prevalence of HIV is high, since the appearance of HIV in 1984, predominantly among heterosexual intravenous drug users. PATIENTS--All (61) women known to be positive for HIV antibody who had had clinically indicated tests, for whom case notes were available for 60. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Risk assessment according to case notes and reported to the laboratory, incidence of infection, geographical location, age, date of positive test result, and reproductive history. RESULTS--With 61 infected women the overall minimum prevalence among women within the city of Dundee was 0.67/1000 and 2.9/1000 among women in their third decade. Of the 60 women whose reproductive history was available, 35 had 57 pregnancies, 36 of which occurred after seroconversion was known to have taken place, representing 8.7% of the total number of affected pregnancies reported for the United Kingdom. If antenatal screening for HIV had been performed between 1984 and 1989 it could not have detected positivity for HIV antibody in 25 (42%) women who had no pregnancies during this time. Among the remaining 35 women, screening samples taken for blood grouping could have identified a maximum of 34 (57%), samples taken to check rubella susceptibility a maximum of 22 (37%), and blood spots on Guthrie cards a maximum of 19 (32%). Retesting would have occurred in 14 women 33 times with samples taken for blood grouping, but three and four women would have been tested twice using samples taken for rubella testing and Guthrie cards respectively. Anonymous screening would have been unable to determine risk category as a history of intravenous drug use was known in 47 (79%) women before testing but this was increased by a further 5 (8%) who admitted to it after the test result was known. CONCLUSION--Interpreting the results of antenatal screening programmes will be complex and will underestimate overall prevalence of HIV antibody among women; this will be exaggerated by strategies based on anonymous testing with Guthrie cards or on samples taken for rubella testing, which do not include women who have had an earlier loss of pregnancy. Only open testing with consent will permit satisfactory attribution to\r"

DESIGN--A double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover trial of 32 weeks' duration. SETTINGS--Cardiology outpatient department, Sassoon General Hospitals, Pune, India. PATIENTS--37 Adults with mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure less than 110 mm Hg). INTERVENTION--Patients received either placebo or potassium 60 mmol/day alone or in combination with magnesium 20 mmol/day in a crossover design. No other drug treatment was allowed. MEASUREMENTS--Blood pressure and heart rate assessed at weekly intervals and biochemical parameters at monthly intervals. RESULTS--Potassium alone or in combination with magnesium produced a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p less than 0.001) and a significant reduction in serum cholesterol concentration (p less than 0.05); other biochemical variables did not change. Magnesium did not have an additional effect. Urinary potassium excretion increased significantly in the groups who received potassium alone or in combination with magnesium. The drug was well tolerated and compliance was satisfactory. CONCLUSION--Potassium 60 mmol/day lowers arterial blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension. Giving magnesium as well has no added advantage.\r"

DESIGN--Audit of physicians by monthly review of two randomly selected sets of patients' notes by 12 reviewers using a detailed questionnaire dedicated to standards of medical records and to clinical management. Data were entered into a database and summary statistics presented quarterly at audit meetings. Assessment by improvement in questionnaire scores and by interviewing physicians. SETTING--1 District general hospital. PARTICIPANTS--About 40 consultant physicians, senior registrars, and junior staff dealing with 140 inpatient records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Median scores (range 1 to 9) for each item in the questionnaire; two sets of notes were discussed monthly at \"general\" audit meetings and clinical management of selected common conditions at separate monthly meetings. RESULTS--A significant overall increase in median scores for questions on record keeping occurred after the start of the audit (p less than 0.01), but interobserver variation was high. The parallel audit meetings on clinical management proved to be more successful than the general audits in auditing medical care and were also considered to be more useful by junior staff. CONCLUSIONS AND ACTION--Medical audit apparently resulted in appreciable improvements in aspects of care such as clerking and record keeping. Analysis of the scores of the general audits has led to the introduction of agreed standards that can be objectively measured and are being used in a further audit, and from the results of the audits of clinical management have been developed explicit guidelines, which are being further developed for criterion based audit.\r"

DESIGN--Telephone survey of hospitals in six health regions in England and Wales. SETTING--70 Randomly selected hospitals, 15 of which were excluded because of non-acceptance of acute medical admissions. PARTICIPANTS--71 Duty doctors (duty house physicians, senior house officers, or registrars responsible for acute medical admissions) in 48 hospitals; seven duty doctors in seven hospitals were excluded (four declined to participate and three required a written explanation of the survey). 67 Doctors gave full information to all questions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Time taken for hospital switchboards and duty doctors to reply to telephone call, diagnoses of patients recently admitted, and on call rotas and hours of sleep of duty doctors. RESULTS--Hospital switchboards responded within 30 seconds in 87 (74%) calls, and in 76 calls (64%) the duty doctor requested was contacted within a further two minutes. Chest pain, possibly due to myocardial infarction, was the most common reason for acute medical admissions. Nearly half (48%) of the duty doctors in larger hospitals reported having 4-5 hours sleep or less on their nights on call. Most (30) were on a one in three rota; two were on a one in two rota. CONCLUSIONS--Despite impressions to the contrary contacting the duty medical team by telephone seemed fairly easy. Although most junior doctors were on a rota of one in three or better, insufficient recognition may be given to their deprivation of sleep during nights on duty.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective study of clinical case notes. SETTING--Renal units of the Northern region, particularly that in Newcastle upon Tyne. PATIENTS--All 65 diabetic patients treated by renal replacement treatment in Newcastle upon Tyne from 1964 to 1987; 42 diabetic patients were matched with 42 non-diabetic patients according to age, sex, year of starting treatment, and type of treatment (dialysis or transplantation). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Sex, age, renal biopsy findings, blood pressure, history of diabetic treatment, and plasma creatinine concentration at the start of renal replacement treatment. History of renal replacement treatments, suitability for transplantation, history of transplantation, cumulative survival, and cause of death during follow up. Survival of technique, cumulative survival of the first peritoneal catheter and history of peritonitis in patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis; source of graft, histocompatibility antigens, duration of associated stay in hospital, and graft survival in patients receiving renal or pancreatic transplant. RESULTS--1259 Patients with chronic renal failure were accepted for renal replacement treatment in Newcastle upon Tyne, of whom 65 (5%) had diabetes. The first was accepted in 1974, and between 1974 and 1980 another 15 were treated (mean age 42 years; 4% of new patients). From 1981 to 1987, 49 diabetic patients (mean age 44; 9% of new patients) were treated. Fifty patients (77%) had insulin dependent diabetes and the remaining 15 (23%) non-insulin dependent diabetes. On average, the patients were aged 25 (range 5-57) when diabetes was first diagnosed and 44 (range 24-70) at the start of renal replacement treatment. The mean age at the start of treatment was 40 for patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes and 58 for patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes. Transplantation was performed in 33 of the diabetic patients, whose mean age was lower than that of those who did not receive a transplant (41 v 48 respectively, p less than 0.05). Comparison between the 42 diabetic patients and matched controls showed that the overall survival at five years was 46% and 77% respectively. The three year survival of the diabetic patients who did not receive a transplant was poor (41% v 79% respectively). Of patients transplanted, survival at five years was 73% in the diabetic patients and 90% in the controls. However, there was no significant difference in the five year graft survival (64% v 46% respectively). CONCLUSIONS--Diabetes adversely affects morbidity and mortality in patients having renal replacement treatment, but renal transplantation seems to be the best option for treating diabetic patients with end stage renal failure.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patient characteristics, history of smoking, prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial ischaemia at start of renal replacement treatment; survival of patients with renal replacement treatment and of patients and allografts with renal transplantation. RESULTS--The overall survival of the diabetic patients during the treatment was 83%, 59%, and 50% at one, three, and five years. Survival was significantly poorer in the diabetic patients than the controls (p less than 0.001). Particularly adverse features for outcome at the start of treatment were increasing age (p less than 0.01) and current cigarette smoking (relative risk (95% confidence interval) 2.28 (0.93 to 4.84), p less than 0.05). Deaths were mainly from cardiac and vascular causes. The incidence of peritonitis in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was the same in diabetic patients and controls (49% in each group remained free of peritonitis after one year), and the survival of renal allografts was not significantly worse in diabetic patients (p less than 0.5). CONCLUSIONS--Renal replacement treatment may give good results in diabetic patients, although the outlook remains less favourable than for non-diabetic patients because of coexistent, progressive vascular disease, which is more severe in older patients.\r"

Mucin enhanced the formation of large characteristic aggregates and also led to the formation of calcium oxalate dihydrate crystals. Particles of mucin in a solution served as a substrate on which several crystals of calcium oxalate dihydrate were formed by heterogeneous nucleation; the subsequent growth of these crystals resulted in the formation of large agglomerates.\r"

The duration of ischaemia ranged from 15 to 365 min but was longer in those who underwent ex vivo surgery (149 to 365 min). Of the 21 patients who underwent partial nephrectomy or enucleation, the serum creatinine level increased (greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl) post-operatively in 16 patients, of whom 9 required temporary haemodialysis. No recurrence has been noted in those who underwent partial nephrectomy, but 1 patient who underwent enucleation of the tumour developed a solitary pancreatic metastasis 2 years 6 months after surgery and was treated by a partial pancreatectomy. Kidney-preserving surgical procedures are considered to improve the quality of life, but careful follow-up is necessary.\r"

It was concluded that following failed ureteroscopic manipulation of calculi, insertion of a double pigtail stent was associated with a higher subsequent success rate for removal of stone by ureteroscopy and a consequent lower rate of ureterolithotomy.\r"

Histochemical staining with PAS-colloidal iron/Van Geison's counterstain offers improved diagnostic ability for the pathologist and correlates well with immunofluorescent findings. Four distinct diseases can be identified through immunofluorescent staining, indicating that each is the result of different responses of the urothelium and endothelium to injury. Loss of bladder capacity associated with these diseases can be expected with age, but immunofluorescent staining for IgM within the capillaries of the interstitium is a more sensitive predictor.\r"

Recent concepts in the diagnosis of this condition mean that it is emerging as a much more common entity, with both early and late forms of the disease being described. Mast cell density in the detrusor muscle has been reported to be useful as a disease marker to substantiate the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis where no classical diagnostic features exist. We assessed mast cell counts in bladder biopsies from 27 women with idiopathic sensory urgency and 10 control patients about to undergo a colposuspension procedure for pure genuine stress incontinence; 30% of the study group had a clear increase in the detrusor muscle mast cell population (detrusor mastocytosis). No control patient showed such an increase. Early interstitial cystitis should be considered as a possible cause of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with apparently idiopathic sensory urgency.\r"

A dilutional method was used to calculate this residual volume in 15 men; 10 had acute retention secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia and 5 had permanent indwelling catheters for neurogenic urinary incontinence. The mean catheterised residual volume was 98.53 ml for patients with acute retention and 14.48 ml for patients with long-term catheters. The explanation for higher post-catheterisation volumes in the acute retention group is probably multifactorial; bladder sacculation and diverticula, detrusor tone and reflux may all play a role.\r"

The monoclonal antibody Ki67 recognises an antigen present in actively dividing cells and Ki67 reactivity has been shown to correlate with conventional prognostic indicators in several tumours. In this study, Ki67 antibody was used to determine the proportions of cells undergoing active division in 26 transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder. The proportion of cells stained in muscle invasive tumours (12.3 +/- 5.4%) was significantly greater than in superficial tumours (4.3 +/- 1.9%) and poorly differentiated tumours showed significantly greater proportions of cells staining compared with well or moderately well differentiated tumours. These results show that Ki67 reactivity correlates with high tumour stage and poor differentiation. Ki67 staining provides an easy method of determining tumour cell turnover that might provide additional prognostic information.\r"

Complete bladder emptying with reduced voiding pressures was achieved, together with a significant reduction in the duration of hyper-reflexic contractions. Epithelialisation of the stent was almost complete within 3 months and intermittent catheterisation or endoscopy (and resection) is possible through the stent. Although this is a preliminary report of this new technique, it is hoped that sphincter stenting will provide a rapid, safe and effective method of treating high pressure hyper-reflexia and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia in quadriplegic patients.\r"

A screening peak urinary flow rate of 12 ml/s or less was associated with urodynamic evidence of obstruction in 95% of cases; 35% of patients with symptoms of outflow obstruction and a flow rate greater than 12 ml/s were also found to be obstructed. One year post-operatively, 84% of patients who were selected for surgery on combined symptomatic and urodynamic criteria were pleased symptomatically with their result. The failure of detrusor instability to resolve following prostatectomy was associated with symptomatic failure of treatment. Residual obstruction was demonstrated in 5 patients who had undergone prostatectomy and were asymptomatic at this time. This study illustrates that objective measures are necessary in the assessment of patients prior to prostatectomy in order to select only patients who are obstructed. The importance of a screening flow rate is emphasised. All patients who underwent surgery had cystometric evidence of obstruction but the symptomatic results of surgery were no better than the results in patients who had been assessed according to non-urodynamic selection criteria. We have thus failed to identify a need for routine cystometry in the pre-operative assessment of these patients. Cystometry does, however, have a role in assessing patients with pre-operative flow rates greater than 12 ml/s and in those who remain symptomatic following prostatectomy.\r"

The aim was to categorise the morphological appearances according to current criteria and to determine the natural history of any pre-malignant lesions within this group. A \"control\" series of patients (n = 40) in whom the primary diagnosis was benign were also reviewed and their course followed (group 2). The heterogeneity of the abnormalities in group 1 was striking. Of the 44 cases, pre-malignant lesions were seen in 8, microinvasive adenocarcinoma in 11 and lesions not now considered pre-malignant in the remaining 25. None of the 8 patients with pre-malignant lesions developed clinical evidence of carcinoma over a follow-up period of 8 to 12 years. In contrast, 3 of the 11 diagnosed on review as having microscopic invasive adenocarcinoma developed clinically evident tumour within 5 years of surgery. Of the 25 patients whose prostatic lesions were considered benign, 2 developed carcinoma 12 and 13 years after surgery. Only 1 of the 40 patients in group 2 had a pre-malignant lesion and he did not develop tumour within 10 years. However, adenocarcinoma was diagnosed incidentally in 1 patient 3 years after surgery. It was concluded that there is a need to standardise interpretation and reporting of pre-malignant lesions and microscopic foci of adenocarcinoma in the prostate. The limited results on the course of pre-malignant lesions diagnosed incidentally in patients over 60 years of age do not indicate that follow-up would have prompted the early diagnosis of invasive disease.\r"

Six tumours were located in the tail of the pancreas, two in the body and three in the head. Most patients complained of abdominal pain or a mass. Ultrasonographic and/or computed tomography findings showed five solid, four mixed (solid and cystic) and two cystic types of tumour. Angiographically, PCNP was either a hypovascular or mild hypervascular mass with a displacement of the surrounding vessels. No vascular encasement was seen. Macroscopically all 11 tumours consisted of a well defined solid mass with degenerative change of various widths, including haemorrhage, necrosis or dystrophic calcification, and were represented by three radiological types of PCNP. The 11 patients with PCNP survived for from 3 to 253 months after curative resection without any signs of local recurrence or remote metastasis. PCNP usually affects the distal portion of the pancreas of young women. Despite its huge size, PCNP should be explored with aggressive surgical intent because of the inherently good prognosis.\r"

A patient was more likely to be treated by partial gastrectomy if a giant ulcer with an internal diameter of greater than or equal to 2 cm was found. The results suggest that while vagotomy and pyloroplasty, combined with a direct attack on the bleeding point or excision of an anterior ulcer is an acceptable standard emergency operation for bleeding duodenal ulcer, gastric resection proved to be a satisfactory alternative procedure and should be considered in the technically difficult case with a very large ulcer. A giant ulcer was present in 37 per cent of cases coming to surgery.\r"

The mean follow-up time was 4.5 years with a range of 2-7 years. One elderly patient died from a myocardial infarction in the TVP group. Acid secretory inhibition in response to insulin and pentagastrin stimuli was equal in both groups, indicating a similar degree of vagal denervation. Recurrent ulcers were more common after AMPT (five) than TVP (two) (P = 0.29, n.s.). Dumping and diarrhoea were significantly commoner (P less than 0.001) after TVP, with 31 instances as opposed to eight with AMPT. The mean operating time was increased by 6 min when AMPT was performed rather than TVP. The results of this study have shown that AMPT is associated with a lower incidence of dumping and diarrhoea and achieves better overall Visick grading. However, continued monitoring is required to assess the long-term incidence of recurrent ulceration after this procedure.\r"

In this study the value of a new serum marker, CA72-4, was compared with the serum activities of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA19-9 in a consecutive series of patients with gastric cancer. The results show that the CA72-4 assay is significantly better at separating stage I and II disease from normal controls (P less than 0.01) than CEA (n.s.) or CA19-9 (n.s.). CA72-4 also gave better differentiation between patients with positive and negative nodes (P less than 0.01) and between those who were serosa positive and negative (P less than 0.01). CEA differentiated between patients with positive and negative nodes (P less than 0.05) but CA19-9 could not. CA19-9 and CEA could not discriminate between patients who were serosa positive and negative. In this study, at a specificity of 95 per cent, the sensitivities of CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 were 0.25, 0.41 and 0.94 respectively. These preliminary findings indicate that CA72-4 is a reliable tumour marker of disease stage and activity in gastric cancer.

Six patients of median age 63 years underwent total gastrectomy for malignancy. At follow-up (median 45 months, range 25-60 months) each patient was clinically tumour-free and underwent dietary assessment, faecal fat and nitrogen measurement and routine haematological testing. Protein and fat stores, measured by neutron activation analysis and the tritiated water dilution technique, were compared with the same measurements made before operation and with predicted values. Mean (s.d.) dietary intake (2224(381) kcal day-1 and 81(15)g protein day-1) met the patients' estimated requirements. Mean(s.d.) serum albumin and faecal nitrogen values were normal but there was notable steatorrhoea (21(17) g day-1). Body composition measurements revealed profound deficiencies of body-weight (P less than 0.02), protein (P less than 0.01) and fat (P less than 0.02) before operation which were not corrected by an apparently curative total gastrectomy (P less than 0.05), although further deterioration was prevented.\r"

Complete regression of tumour was observed endoscopically in 19 patients, and partial regression in four. Fourteen patients had their tumours resected and in six no microscopic tumour was found in the specimen. Nine patients received additional radiotherapy to a total dose of 54-60 Gy instead of surgery. Tumour response was associated with rapid reversal of dysphagia. Only one patient required subsequent intervention for relief of dysphagia due to fibrous stricture. Enhanced survival was associated with a complete endoscopic response to initial chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and a tumour of less than 5 cm in length. The median survival of responding patients was 15 months. Synchronous chemotherapy and radiotherapy was of major palliative benefit in this series and merits further evaluation.\r"

Since intestinal motility of the Roux limb has never been evaluated after this operation, pressure activity was investigated in the Roux limb of ten patients (aged 51-77 years) who had undergone total gastrectomy and Roux-Orr reconstruction. Investigations were carried out during a 6-h fast and 3 h after a 605 kcal mixed meal. During fasting only two patients had activity fronts and these were abnormal. All ten patients displayed non-propagating bursts of contractions and three had discrete clustered contractions and high amplitude jejunal contractions. The fed state was characterized by a severely reduced motor activity pattern and other abnormalities. Total gastrectomy with Roux-Orr anastomoses provokes a relatively severe disturbance in intestinal activity.\r"

  ".W": "An alternative procedure to construction of a pelvic ileal reservoir was assessed which avoids the need for a pouch, while providing an adequate rectal substitute and good continence. Thirty-six female adult beagles were allotted randomly to undergo total colectomy with (a) ileo-anal anastomosis alone, (b) ileo-anal anastomosis with two 15 cm myectomies, (c) ileo-anal anastomosis and myectomy with an ileo-ileal valve, or (d) ileo-anal anastomosis with a duplicated J pouch. The animals were studied before operation and at 4-weekly intervals for 20 weeks after operation. Mortality rates were similar. Ileal compliance was increased significantly by myectomy from 0.64 ml/mmHg (median, interquartile range 0.49-0.78) after ileo-anal anastomosis alone to 1.65 mmHg (1.16-1.93), P less than 0.01, an increase which was maintained. Ileal capacity was also increased both by myectomy and by the J pouch: ileo-anal anastomosis = 85 ml (75-100 ml), ileo-anal anastomosis and myectomy = 139 ml (116-156 ml), ileo-anal anastomosis and myectomy and ileo-ileal valve = 125 ml (range 85-145 ml), ileo-anal anastomosis and J pouch = 130 ml (range 75-165 ml) (P less than 0.01). Bowel function in the other three groups was markedly superior to ileo-anal anastomosis alone. Mean transit time was significantly less after ileo-anal anastomosis, 5.2 h (2.6-8.2 h) than after both ileo-anal anastomosis and myectomy, 10.5 h (9.6-13.9 h), P less than 0.05 and ileo-anal anastomosis and J pouch, 11.0 h (8.4-13.0 h), P less than 0.05, but addition of an ileo-ileal valve did not produce a further increase in transit time, 12.9 h (range 10.5-14.5 h), P = n.s.. Myectomy of single lumen ileum may be a useful alternative to a pelvic ileal reservoir in restorative proctocolectomy.\r"

  ".W": "From 1966 to 1987, 177 consecutive patients were operated on electively for diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon. The indications for surgery were: colovesical fistula (n = 12), suspicion of residual abscess (n = 39), two or more previous attacks of acute inflammation (n = 52), chronic symptoms (n = 72) and suspicion of carcinoma (n = 2). An abscess was found at operation in 76 patients (43 per cent) and this was extracolic with local peritonitis in 52 patients (29 per cent). An unsuspected abscess was found in 25 of the 72 patients operated on for chronic symptoms. Colonic resection with primary anastomosis was performed in 95 per cent of the 177 patients and in 94 per cent of those 52 patients with an extracolic abscess. There were no postoperative deaths and no clinical anastomotic leakages. Long-term results were very good in 85 per cent of the 177 patients and in 82 per cent of the 72 patients operated on for chronic symptoms. The results of this series suggest that a one-stage procedure can be safely performed with some technical precautions in most patients operated on electively for diverticular disease, even if an extracolic abscess is found. The good long-term results in patients operated on for chronic symptoms suggest that such symptoms should be taken into account with respect to surgical indications.\r"

  ".W": "Transposition of the gracilis muscle for faecal incontinence was performed in 13 patients. Six gained satisfactory continence, four were improved, two did not benefit from the operation and one patient died from intercurrent disease before closure of a pre-existing colostomy. Anal manometry compared with a control group showed no alteration in resting and pressure at a median of 35 mmHg (range 5-63 mmHg), whereas maximum squeeze pressure increased from a median of 38 mmHg (range 5-79 mmHg) to 59 mmHg (range 10-143 mmHg) (P = 0.041) which was, however, significantly lower than 130 mmHg (range 81-236 mmHg) in the control group. All patients who benefited from the operation had an increase in maximum squeeze pressure. The ability to retain a viscous fluid in the rectum was measured in seven patients, four of whom had gained satisfactory continence and three of whom had improved continence. They were able to retain a median volume of 200 ml (range 50-225 ml) without leakage compared with 325 ml (range 250-400 ml) in the control group. These patients could retain the maximum amount of viscous fluid for 5-8 min, whereas all control subjects could do so for more than 15 min. It is concluded that, although gracilis transposition never results in normal continence, acceptable continence may be achieved in selected patients provided careful attention is paid to the technical details of the procedure and provided that systematic postoperative exercises are performed.\r"

Almost half had used thrombolysis in the previous 12 months. Low dose intra-arterial streptokinase (89 per cent) was the regimen most frequently used, but 33 per cent had used intravenous streptokinase. Detailed results for 103 patients (limb salvage rate 60 per cent, amputation rate 35 per cent, mortality rate 5 per cent) were similar to those of previously published reports. Complications in most series were infrequent, but in the entire survey there were six bleeding-related deaths and one death from anaphylaxis. A total of 67 per cent of surgeons with working experience indicated that selected patients with acute arterial thromboses were most suitable for thrombolysis, particularly if there was no neurological deficit and no run-off for surgical bypass. Distal or late emboli and graft occlusions were regarded as appropriate by some surgeons. This study demonstrated that many vascular surgeons currently use thrombolysis, although sparingly and in selected cases. Patients with acute limb ischaemia should be managed by experienced vascular surgeons who are aware of the new therapeutic alternatives, an ideal supported by almost three-quarters of respondents to this survey.\r"

Follow-up was from 3 to 12 years. Only the sympathetic ganglia had been removed during the previous surgery by the axillary approach (67 per cent of these patients had had a transient response for between 6 months and 2 years; 33 per cent had had no response at all). A direct subjective improvement was seen after 27 of the 35 reoperations (77 per cent). In 14 patients continuous wave Doppler ultrasound studies were available and showed a significant increase in peak forward frequency after operation (P less than 0.001). From these data it may be concluded that it is possible to obtain a resympathectomy effect, but reoperation should be reserved for special cases for whom survival of digits is essential.\r"

Previous studies have suggested that peroperative venous distension may be a factor associated with venous thromboembolism. In this study we have obtained high resolution ultrasound images of gastrocnemius and posterior tibial veins in 62 patients undergoing a range of general surgical procedures. From these we determined the changes in vein diameter occurring during the operative procedures, in response to induction of anaesthesia, and after completion of surgery. Veins showed no evidence of dilatation in response to the induction of anaesthesia, but by the end of the operative procedure showed distension of 22-28 per cent. Distension was most prominent in the gastrocnemius veins, and lesser distension was observed in the posterior tibial veins. In a series of patients who received an infusion of 1 litre of saline in addition to basal requirements, distension was 57 per cent compared with 22 per cent in the corresponding control group. Intraoperative venous distension is associated with factors that lead to deep vein thrombosis and may be involved in the mechanisms which result in the commencement of deep vein thrombosis.\r"

The importance of the spleen in host defence against malaria and other infections makes splenic preservation desirable whenever possible after rupture of the spleen. Tropical splenomegaly is caused by an abnormal immune response to malaria and is best managed medically. Careful selection of blood donors is essential to prevent transfusion malaria, and routine antimalarial prophylaxis is indicated for blood recipients in many endemic areas. The risk of postoperative malaria may justify chemoprophylaxis in certain patients.\r"

Since that time, over 400 patients have undergone PPPD with approximately 41 per cent having chronic pancreatitis and 54 per cent having pancreatic and other periampullary malignancies. Reported 5-year survivals in this latter group have been comparable to those achieved by the classic Whipple procedure. The postoperative mortality rate in 339 reported patients has been 3.8 per cent. Postoperative morbidity, including delayed gastric emptying, has been similar to that of the classic Whipple operation. However, PPPD has been associated with fewer late problems with dumping, diarrhoea, delayed gastric emptying (8.6 per cent), and marginal ulceration (3.6 per cent). Moreover, most patients undergoing PPPD have been able to return to their preoperative and preillness weight. The additional advantage of decreased operative time makes PPPD an attractive alternative to the classic pancreatoduodenectomy.\r"

Choledochoscopy should now be a mandatory part of common bile duct exploration.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1982 and April 1989, 134 patients with a suspected liver neoplasm were referred to the liver unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. In 105 (78 per cent), a primary hepatic neoplasm was histologically confirmed, and 47 patients (45 per cent) proved to have primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Twenty-nine orthotopic liver transplants were performed in 28 of these patients (27 per cent). Twenty patients (71 per cent) survived 30 days or longer (median 11.5 months; range 2-87 months), of whom nine are currently alive. We retrospectively analysed our data to determine the influence of preoperative evaluation, histological type and staging on outcome. Computed tomography proved to be superior to intraoperative assessment (86 versus 58 per cent) in diagnosing tumour positive nodes. Patients with tumour negative lymphadenopathy had a better prognosis. Postoperative stage I/II had a median survival of 16 months (range 3-87 months) compared with 7.5 months (range 2-20 months) for stage III. Non-cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had the best prognosis; cholangiocellular carcinoma and cirrhotic patients with hepatocelluar carcinoma had the worst outcome with no survivors beyond 1 year. Because of the advanced stage of disease at the time of presentation, the value of liver transplantation in primary liver cancer is limited. For those presenting with advanced disease confined to the liver (stage I/II) in whom conventional hepatic resection is not possible, significant benefit can be achieved in selected cases.\r"

To investigate the effectiveness of mucosal intussusception in preventing ascending cholangitis, 20 mongrel dogs were randomized to undergo Roux-en-Y cholecystjejunostomy and common bile duct ligation with or without mucosal intussusception. Aeromonas hydrophila was instilled into the gastrointestinal tract. Bacterial cultures were grown from samples taken from the gallbladders and lower jejunum, and blood chemistry and barium studies were performed. The barium studies showed satisfactory lack of reflux in all ten dogs with mucosal intussusception. Only two of them had positive cultures for Aeromonas from the gallbladder 3 days after bacterial instillation into the jejunum. All ten dogs in the control group had positive cultures for Aeromonas from the gallbladder. Our results showed that the mucosal intussusception group had a significantly lower rate of recovery of organisms from the gallbladder compared with the control group when the organisms were instilled into distal intestine (P less than 0.05). The method is worthy of clinical trial as a means of preventing or treating ascending cholangitis.\r"

The action of these opioids on the sphincter of Oddi was evaluated by means of intraoperative manometry in 36 patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy. Both opioids were given in intravenous cumulative equipotent doses up to a maximum of 10 micrograms/kg morphine or 100 micrograms/kg pethidine. At these doses, morphine increased the mean(s.d.) frequency of contractions from 2.4(1.0) to 7.9(1.6) (P less than 0.001); this effect was reduced by naloxone (0.04 mg bolus, P less than 0.05). Pethidine inhibited the frequency of contractions from 1.5(0.8) to 0.8(0.5) (P less than 0.05); this response was blocked by atropine (0.6 mg bolus, P less than 0.01). Pretreatment with atropine or naloxone reduced the frequency of contractions significantly (P less than 0.05). The results illustrate different responses to pethidine and morphine of the sphincter of Oddi, and provide a pharmacological explanation for the suitability of pethidine over morphine as the analgesic of choice in patients experiencing biliary pain.\r"

High resolution intraoperative ultrasonography is safe and more accurate than preoperative imaging and surgical exploratory methods. The examination is simple to perform and success appears to be related to careful attention to detail.\r"

Healon was significantly superior to Orcolon in all four areas. Further evaluations were performed on the first day and at 2 weeks postoperatively. Measurements of intraocular pressure (IOP) by Goldmann applanation and evaluations of corneal edema, epithelial keratitis and anterior chamber cellular reaction were recorded. Multivariable statistical analysis revealed only one difference between the two groups: significantly more patients in the Orcolon group (eight cases) than in the Healon group (two cases) had an IOP of 21 mm Hg or greater on the first postoperative day.\r"

Steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used to treat postoperative inflammation, but their effect on the maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis is unknown. Forty-six patients admitted for elective cataract surgery were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups and received 1% prednisolone acetate, 1% indomethacin or artificial tears four times before surgery, in addition to standardized preoperative dilating drops and intraoperative epinephrine. Pupillary diameter was measured and the time interval noted five times during the surgery. During surgery the indomethacin group lost significantly less mydriasis than the control group. The mydriasis losses of the prednisolone acetate group were between those of the indomethacin and control groups, but these differences did not reach significance. We conclude that prednisolone acetate is less effective than indomethacin for maintaining mydriasis during cataract surgery.\r"

The treatment group demonstrated statistically significant maintenance of pupillary area at each stage and in total (p = 0.003).

  ".W": "Physicians' response to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is poorly understood and often attributed to fear of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection through occupational exposure. We surveyed 268 physicians from three geographic regions in North American with different specialties and responsibilities for HIV-positive patients. An important difference was found between the published risk and the physicians' perceived risk of infection after a single occupational exposure. Almost half of the respondents stated that they feared contracting AIDS more than other diseases. The physicians who perceived themselves to be at high physical risk were more likely than the others to report that AIDS had changed the way they interact with their patients (r = 0.26, p less than 0.001). No relation was found between the perception of physical risk and the number of HIV-infected patients (r = -0.07, p = 0.15). However, the perception of social risk showed a small inverse correlation (r = -0.15, p less than 0.02), in which the physicians with more HIV-infected patients reported less concern about negative social consequences. The physicians who perceived themselves to be at high personal risk were more likely than the others to report that surgeons have the right to refuse patients who do not wish to undergo HIV antibody testing (r = -0.16, p less than 0.01 for physical risk; r = -0.29, p less than 0.001 for social risk). Multiple regression analyses indicated that physicians' perception of physical risk was not related to age or sex but was modestly related to income source. The perception of social risk was related to sex and income source. Physicians' perception of personal risk is a crucial, yet often unacknowledged, component of the fight against AIDS. Our findings suggest that lack of attention to this issue is seriously compromising initiatives designed to facilitate physician participation in AIDS care.\r"
