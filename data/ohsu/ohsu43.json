MAP was decreased to 50 per cent of the awake level by infusion of SNP in Group I (n = 8) and with ISO in Group II (n = 8). Fentanyl (10-16 micrograms X kg-1) was administered to both groups. Haemodynamic measurements were repeated in the lateral position before, during and after hypotension. Polygeline and fresh frozen plasma were infused throughout the study period in volumes sufficient to maintain pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the 7-9 mmHg range. The MAP decrease was the same in both groups, as were perioperative blood replacement (mean 500 ml), and postoperative haematocrits. Total perioperative fluid replacement was higher (p less than 0.01) in Group I (mean 2500 ml) than in Group II (mean 1300 ml). Venous tone was more affected by SNP than by ISO. ISO decreased the systemic vascular resistance index and oxygen consumption (VO2) without any change in CI or in Qs/Qt, in contrast to SNP which increased CI, VO2 and Qs/Qt.\r"

The children were mechanically ventilated with halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen. FIO2 was kept constant in each child. After induction of anaesthesia, FRC was 17 +/- 7 ml X kg-1 (mean +/- 1 SD), corresponding to 60 +/- 22 per cent of a predicted awake value. FRC increased to 21 +/- 8 ml X kg-1 (p = 0.0005) when the child was turned to its right side and decreased to 13 +/- 5 ml X kg-1 (p = 0.0003) when the pleura was opened. No significant change in Crs or PaO2 occurred during these manoeuvres. Retraction of the upper lung to visualize the great vessels caused a significant decrease in FRC, Crs, and PaO2. The lowest PaO2 observed during this stage was 70.0 mmHg. After surgery FRC and PaO2 were about the same as before surgery while Crs had decreased from 0.87 +/- 0.18 preoperatively to 0.64 +/- 0.15 ml X cmH2O-1 X kg-1 (p = 0.0069). This study shows that FRC increases when mechanically ventilated children are placed in the lateral position, and that thoracotomy is associated with marked changes in FRC, Crs and PaO2.\r"

Antinociception was determined by measuring motor reaction threshold to the noxious pressure on the tail with the use of an \"Analgesymeter.\" Stress was induced by placement of a clamp on the hind paw. The stress procedure was found to cause an increase in reaction threshold, which was partially suppressed by naloxone 0.5 mg X kg-1. Pentobarbitone in a subanaesthetic dose of 25 mg X kg-1, SC, almost completely abolished the stress-induced increase in the reaction threshold (an increase in reaction threshold from 329 +/- 33 g to 486 +/- 62 g in control group, and from 250 +/- 26 g to 273 +/- 35 g in pentobarbitone group, p less than 0.02 for the difference in the threshold changes). Thiopentone used in a dose of 25 mg X kg-1, IV, caused a loss of the righting reflex for 37 +/- 10 minutes; stress procedure applied ten minutes after regaining the righting reflex did not cause any increase in the reaction threshold (with an increase in the reaction threshold in control group from 355 +/- 50 g to 540 +/- 26 g, p less than 0.001 for the difference between the groups). The results suggest that the barbiturates in subanaesthetic doses inhibit stress-induced analgesia. Thiopentone used in an anaesthetic dose has the potential for inhibition of stress-induced analgesia in the period of recovery from anaesthesia.\r"

Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone, nitrous oxide, and pancuronium; following tracheal intubation, fentanyl (approximately 30 micrograms X kg-1 for infants and children, 20 micrograms X kg-1 for adults) was administered as a 2-min IV infusion. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide, pancuronium, and morphine sulphate as clinically indicated. Plasma samples were obtained for 4 h and fentanyl concentrations determined by radioimmunoassay. Plasma concentrations per microgram X kg-1 fentanyl administered were lowest in infants 4-10 and 60-240 min after the start of the 2-min infusion; values for children were lower than those for adults 4, 180 and 210 min after the start of the 2-min infusion. These findings are consistent with the authors' clinical observation that infants tolerate larger doses of fentanyl than do adults.\r"

Recent reports, however, have indicated that the development of aortic aneurysms at or near the coarctation segment may complicate attempts to treat this lesion by catheter-based intervention. Accordingly, we examined the light microscopic features of coarctation segments excised at surgery (n = 31) or obtained at autopsy (n = 2) in 33 patients with coarctation of the aorta. Cystic medial necrosis, defined as depletion and disarray of elastic tissue, was observed in each of the 33 specimens. In the majority of coarctation specimens (22 of 33 or 67%) the extent of cystic medial necrosis, graded semiquantitatively on a scale of 0 (normal aorta) to 3+, was severe (3+). The finding that cystic medial necrosis represents a consistent histologic feature of coarctation of the aorta provides a pathologic basis for the formation of aneurysms observed after balloon angioplasty of coarctation sites.\r"

The morphologic findings in these 11 patients and in the 26 cases cited in the literature are reviewed. Pathogenic considerations have included viral-induced lesion, cardiomyopathy, neoplasm, and developmental disorder of Purkinje cells. We believe this lesion to be a myocardial hamartoma. Supportive evidence includes prevalence in infants, tumorlike growth pattern without mitotic figures, and association of other developmental abnormalities. Through electrophysiologic mapping, this myocardial hamartoma is potentially accessible to surgical excision and long-term cure.\r"

Therefore, using multisensor catheter manometers, we derived wave reflection indexes from ascending aortic pressure and velocity recordings in 17 subjects with clinical heart failure secondary to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 11 control subjects free of detectable cardiovascular disease. Patients were studied at rest as well as during submaximal supine bicycle exercise. Eight of the subjects with cardiomyopathy were also studied during infusion of nitroprusside at rest and on exercise. Reflection indexes decreased on exercise in normal subjects but did not consistently do so in the subjects with heart failure. In both groups the reflected wave on exercise returned earlier during the ejection period. Infusion of nitroprusside at rest in subjects with heart failure had dramatic, and significant, effects on the magnitude and timing of arterial wave reflections. The effect of nitroprusside on reflection magnitude persisted on exercise, although the timing of the reflected wave was disadvantageous. The systemic arterial response to exercise in heart failure is characterized by a smaller change in wave reflection indexes in spite of a comparable decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Nitroprusside diminishes the potentially adverse impact of wave reflections by decreasing the magnitude of the reflected wave and altering its timing. Additional dose titration studies are necessary to fully assess the benefits of pharmacologic vasodilation during exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in animals with normal coronary arteries have shown that coronary flow reserve can be predicted by angiographic measurements of arterial stenosis. Studies in man, however, suggest that even quantitative analysis of coronary angiograms cannot predict the physiologic significance of individual coronary lesions. These studies, however, were carried out in patients with either widespread, diffuse coronary artery disease or by measurement techniques that tend to underestimate maximal coronary flow reserve. To determine the relationship between coronary arterial stenosis and coronary flow reserve (CFR) in patients with discrete limited coronary atherosclerosis, we studied 50 patients with a single discrete coronary stenosis in only one or two vessels. The minimum coronary arterial cross-sectional area (mCSA), percent area stenosis (%AS), and percent diameter stenosis in the left and right anterior oblique projections were determined by the Brown/Dodge method of quantitative coronary angiography. A No. 3F coronary Doppler catheter was placed immediately proximal to the lesion. Measurements of CFR were obtained by intracoronary administration of papaverine in doses sufficient to provide maximal arteriolar vasodilation. In 25 patients, a translesional pressure gradient was obtained with an angioplasty catheter. CFR measured in patients with coronary artery disease was compared with that in 13 patients with normal coronary vessels. In normal patients, CFR averaged 5.0 +/- 0.6 (peak/resting velocity ratio; mean +/- SEM, range 3.7 to 8.2). In patients with limited coronary artery disease, CFR was closely correlated with %AS (r = .85), mCSA (r = .79), and the translesional pressure gradient (r = .83). Additionally, the most severe percent diameter stenosis in either the left or right anterior oblique view was also highly correlated with CFR (r = .82). Importantly, all arteries with lesions producing less than 70% area stenosis and less than 50% diameter stenosis, or with greater than 2.5 mm2 mCSA had CFR of over 3.5. These results suggest that, in contrast to the poor correlation of percent area and percent diameter stenosis to CFR measured in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, CFR measured at angiography in patients with discrete, limited coronary artery disease correlates closely with luminal stenosis determined precisely with quantitative coronary angiography. Differences in the extent of diffuse arterial narrowing may account for these discrepancies.\r"

The results showed a lack of correlation between the block and the lesional pathology of the specialized conducting system. On the other hand, an evaluation of the atrial prenodal myocardium revealed strong clinicopathologic correlation between the block and the necrotic damage to these fibers. Twenty-nine or 97% of patients with AV block showed acute necrosis of the prenodal atrial myocardium. Considering the conducting prenodal septal atrial myocardium as a suprahisian structure, the necrosis at this level would provide an anatomic basis of the block in posterior-inferior acute myocardial infarction. Analysis of the behavior of the AV block after pharmacologic treatment further established a relationship between the block and acute lesions in the central conduction system.\r"

The present study was performed to prospectively assess the shape and mobility patterns of left ventricular thrombi and their spontaneous changes with time. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained in 109 consecutive patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction within 24 hr of the onset of symptoms, every 24 hr until day 5, every 48 hr until day 15, and then every month for a follow-up of 1 to 29 (mean 14 +/- 8) months in the survivors. None of the patients were treated with anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors during the study period. Left ventricular thrombi, detected in 59 patients (54%), appeared from 1 to 362 (mean 12 +/- 47) days after myocardial infarction. At first detection, the shape was mural in 21 patients and protruding in 38; patterns of mobility were present in eight patients. During follow-up, changes in the shape of the thrombi were noted in 24 patients (41%; from mural to protruding in nine, from protruding to mural in 15). These variations were encountered between 2 and 490 (mean 64 +/- 117) days after the first observation of the thrombus. Patterns of mobility, previously detected in eight patients, disappeared in five of eight within 2 to 28 (mean 14 +/- 11) days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87159923\r", 
  ".W": "Although the measurement of transmural pressure is important, calculation of transmural pressure is complicated by the difficulties in measuring pericardial pressure. Recently, flat balloons have been proposed to measure pericardial pressure. Over a wide range of volumes, right ventricular diastolic pressure and pericardial balloon pressure were similar in diastole, suggesting that the right ventricle is unstressed at physiologic volumes and that right atrial pressure can be used to estimate pericardial pressure. To evaluate these concepts and to assess indirectly the accuracy of measuring pericardial pressure using flat balloons, six canine hearts were examined postmortem. The pericardium was removed and the hearts were submerged in cold cardioplegic solution. Balloons were inserted into the right and left ventricles, and right and left ventricular pressure-volume curves were obtained. Right ventricular transmural pressures of 2.6 +/- 0.5, 3.9 +/- 0.9, 5.9 +/- 1.4, and 8.9 +/- 2.4 mm Hg were required to distend the right ventricle to 10, 20, 30, and 40 ml, respectively. For the left ventricle, transmural pressures of 3.4 +/- 0.7, 5.4 +/- 1.2, 8.6 +/- 2.1, and 14.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg were recorded at volumes of 10, 20, 30, and 40 ml, respectively. Although the right ventricular transmural pressures were less than the left ventricular transmural pressures over the physiologic range, right ventricular transmural pressures were always positive and increased with increments in ventricular volume. Thus the right ventricle is not unstressed over the entire range of physiologic volumes, suggesting that pericardial balloon pressures may overestimate pericardial pressure and that right atrial pressure cannot be used to estimate pericardial pressure.\r"

In two patients (one type I, one type III), flow was seen in one lumen only, with clot demonstrated in the other lumen in one of them. Of 12 patients in whom communication between two aortic dissection channels was shown by angiography/surgery, color Doppler correctly identified them in nine patients (four ascending aorta, two aortic arch, and three descending aorta), either by direct visualization of flow moving from one lumen into the other (six patients) or indirectly by analyzing differences in timing of opacification of the two lumina and flow direction (three patients). Also, color Doppler correctly diagnosed aortic regurgitation as severe (aortic regurgitation jet occupying more than 75% of left ventricular outflow) in three patients and moderate in four patients. Color Doppler provides comprehensive evaluation of flow dynamics in aortic dissection.\r"

  ".U": "87159925\r", 
  ".W": "The geometric or anatomic diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse, as opposed to the pathologic diagnosis of myxomatous valve disease, is based on the relationship of the mitral leaflets to the surrounding anulus. Current echocardiographic criteria for this diagnosis include leaflet displacement above the annular hinge points in any two-dimensional view; implicit in this equivalent use of intersecting views is the assumption that the mitral anulus is a euclidean plane. Prolapse by these criteria is found in a surprisingly large proportion of the general population. In most of these individuals, however, prolapse is present in the apical four-chamber view and absent in roughly orthogonal long-axis views of the left ventricle. This frequently observed discrepancy between leaflet-annular relationships in intersecting views suggests an underlying geometric property of the mitral apparatus that would produce the appearance of prolapse in one view without actual leaflet distortion. To address this possibility, a model of the mitral valve and anulus was constructed. When the model anulus was given a nonplanar, saddle-shaped configuration, the clinical observations were reproduced: the leaflets appeared to lie above the low points of the anulus in one plane, and below its high points in a perpendicular plane. Therefore, the appearance of mitral valve prolapse can occur without actual leaflet displacement above the most superior points of the mitral anulus if the anulus is nonplanar. To determine whether this pattern is reflected in the human mitral anulus, two-dimensional echocardiographic views of the mitral apparatus were obtained by rotation about the cardiac apex in 20 patients without evident annular or rheumatic valvular disease. In all cases the mitral anulus, as reconstructed from these views, had a nonplanar systolic configuration, with high points located anteriorly and posteriorly. This is consistent with the findings of other groups in animals, and would favor the appearance of prolapse in the four-chamber view and its absence in long-axis views that are oriented anteroposteriorly. This model can therefore explain the frequently observed discrepancy between leaflet-annular relationships in roughly orthogonal views. It challenges the assumption that the mitral anulus is planar as well as the diagnosis of prolapse in many otherwise normal individuals based on that assumption.\r"

The valves were sterilized in antibiotic solution and stored in a nutrient medium at 4 degrees C and were nonvital. There were 15 in-hospital deaths (6%) and a mortality of 2.7% in patients undergoing an elective first operation. Actuarial survival with the study valve in situ was 57% at 10 years and 38% at 14 years. Only 8.4% of the patients died late from homograft valve failure, chiefly because of failure to refer patients with endocarditis for reoperation or because reoperation was refused in elderly, frail subjects. Incompetence was the sole cause of valve failure and was due either to valve wear or endocarditis. Significant incompetence required reoperation. On actuarial analysis, freedom from significant incompetence for the entire group was 95% at 5 years, 78% at 10 years, and 42% at 14 years. Factors increasing the risk of significant incompetence due to valve wear on multivariate analysis were increasing donor valve age (greater than or equal to 55 years), recipient age (less than 15 years), and an aortic root diameter over 30 mm. Analysis of the patient group that excluded each of these variables (low-risk group), which comprised 61% of the study population, indicated freedom from significant incompetence due to valve wear of 98% at 5 years, 94% at 9 years, and 56% at 13 years.\r"

After transseptal left heart catheterization, PMV was performed with either a single- (20 patients) or double- (14 patients) balloon dilating catheter. Hemodynamic and left ventriculographic findings were evaluated before and after PMV. There was one death. Mitral regurgitation developed or increased in severity in 15 patients (43%). One patient developed complete heart block requiring a permanent pacemaker. PMV resulted in a significant decrease in mitral gradient from 18 +/- 1 to 7 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than .0001) and a significant increase in both cardiac output from 3.9 +/- 0.2 to 4.6 +/- 0.2 liters/min (p less than .001) and in mitral valve area from 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.2 cm2 (p less than .0001) Effective balloon dilating diameter per square meter of body surface area correlated significantly with the decrease in mitral gradient but did not correlate with the degree of mitral regurgitation. There was no correlation of age, prior mitral commissurotomy or mitral calcification with hemodynamic results. PMV is an effective nonsurgical procedure for patients with mitral stenosis, including those with pliable valves, those with previous commissurotomy, and even those with mitral calcification.\r"

EMs were characterized by a shorter propafenone elimination half-life (5.5 +/- 2.1 vs 17.2 +/- 8.0, p less than .001), lower average plasma concentration (Cp) (1.1 +/- 0.6 vs 2.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml/mg daily dosage, p less than .001), and higher oral clearance (1115 +/- 1238 vs 264 +/- 48 ml/min, p less than .001). The active metabolite 5-hydroxypropafenone, assayed in 12 patients, was identified in nine of 10 EMs but in neither of the PMs. A lower incidence of central nervous system side effects was noted in EMs (14% vs 67%, p less than .01). The magnitude of QRS widening at any given propafenone Cp was greater in EMs than PMs. There was no significant difference between EMs and PMs in effective propafenone dose or frequency of antiarrhythmic response. Inhibition of debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation by propafenone was demonstrated both in vivo and in a human liver microsomal system in vitro. We conclude that propafenone is metabolized via the same cytochrome P-450 responsible for debrisoquine's 4-hydroxylation, and that its pharmacokinetics and concentration-response relationships and the incidence of central nervous system side effects are different in patients of different debrisoquine metabolic phenotype.\r"

Over a 7 year period, five patients (three men and two women, ranging in age from 24 to 52 years) without demonstrable heart disease underwent electrophysiologic studies with pharmacologic drug testing because of single (four patients) or multiple (one patient) documented episodes of ventricular fibrillation. The arrhythmic event was unrelated to myocardial ischemia or infarction, metabolic or electrolyte disturbances, drug toxicity, preexcitation, or prolonged QT syndromes. In all three patients receiving no antiarrhythmic drugs and in two pretreated with amiodarone, a rapid poorly tolerated ventricular tachyarrhythmia requiring cardioversion was induced by programmed ventricular stimulation with up to two extrastimuli. In all instances, addition of either oral quinidine or oral disopyramide prevented the induction of sustained ventricular arrhythmias. All five patients were placed on antiarrhythmic drug regimens found effective during electrophysiologic studies and remained asymptomatic during follow-up periods ranging from 12 to 93 (mean 52) months. We conclude that in the patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation in our study: programmed ventricular stimulation reliably replicated the spontaneous arrhythmia, class I antiarrhythmic agents effectively prevented induction of the arrhythmia in the laboratory, and in contrast to the severity of the presenting arrhythmia, a benign clinical course was observed during long-term therapy with class I antiarrhythmic agents.\r"

A left heart pulse duplicator was used to provide a completely controllable system to study aortic incompetence jet morphologies as a function of hemodynamic extremes. The system was first used to calibrate the limits of resolution of color Doppler imaging. Next, to define which jet features reliably predict the defect size or the regurgitant fraction and which are primarily influenced by instantaneous hemodynamic variables, we measured the jets' maximal length, width, proximal width, and temporal pattern of color variance during independent variations in the heart rate, cardiac output, and pressure gradient across the incompetent valve. The proximal jet width (immediately below the valve plane) was the only reliable independent predictor of both the defect size and the regurgitant fraction. Jet depth accurately predicted peak velocity (quantitated by laser Doppler velocimetry); it reliably predicted the severity of incompetence only at a known pressure gradient across the valve. Large defects (5 mm) produced jets with maximal color variance in early diastole, whereas small defects produced pandiastolic variance.\r"

However, little information is available regarding cardiac changes in this preparation. Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of both short-term (3 weeks) and prolonged (2 months) rapid ventricular pacing on cardiac hemodynamics, mass, and chamber size. The effects of short-term pacing on left ventricular wall thickening, blood flow, and metabolism were also examined. Compared with 16 control dogs, dogs paced for either 3 weeks (n = 8) or 2 months (n = 13) exhibited reduced cardiac outputs (control 130 +/- 20 ml/min/kg, 3 week pacing 112 +/- 19 ml/min/kg, 2 month pacing 116 +/- 14 ml/min/kg) and elevated pulmonary wedge pressures (control 10 +/- 3 mm Hg, 3 week pacing 26 +/- 5 mm Hg, 2 month pacing 26 +/- 8 mm Hg) and right atrial pressures (control 4 +/- 1 mm Hg, 3 week pacing 13 +/- 3 mm Hg, 2 month pacing 9 +/- 3 mm Hg) (all p less than .01 vs control). At the postmortem examination, both groups of paced dogs also exhibited increased left ventricular volumes (control 13 +/- 6 ml, 3 week pacing 27 +/- 6 ml, 2 month pacing 26 +/- 8 ml), right ventricular volumes (control 13 +/- 5 ml, 3 week pacing 27 +/- 9, 2 month pacing 24 +/- 7 ml), and right ventricular mass (control 27 +/- 5 g, 3 week pacing 32 +/- 6 g, 2 month pacing 34 +/- 6 g) (all p less than .03 vs control) but had normal left ventricular mass. Three weeks of pacing also decreased percent left ventricular shortening (34 +/- 6% to 17 +/- 7%) associated with a disproportionate deterioration of posterior wall thickening (58 +/- 16% to 17 +/- 18%) (both p less than .01), as assessed by echocardiography. This left ventricular dysfunction was associated with no change in myocardial lactate extraction (prepacing 40 +/- 10%, 3 week pacing 36 +/- 10%), myocardial arteriovenous O2 difference, or myocardial histology, suggesting that it was not due to myocardial ischemia. These data indicate that rapid ventricular pacing in the dog produces a useful experimental preparation of low-output heart failure characterized by biventricular pump dysfunction, biventricular cardiac dilation, and nonischemic impairment of left ventricular contractility.\r"

Study groups consisted of 14 sham-operated dogs, 16 dogs with phenol painted over a diagonal branch, 13 dogs with latex embolization of a diagonal branch that resulted in transmural myocardial infarction, 14 dogs with a one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch producing nontransmural myocardial infarction, and 12 dogs undergoing both phenol painting and one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch. Four to 22 days after the first operation, PVS was performed in anesthetized, open-chest dogs after neural decentralization of the heart. Dogs with phenol painting on the epicardium and dogs in which latex was injected into a diagonal branch showed supersensitive shortening of ERP to infused norepinephrine at apical sites. PVS resulted in ventricular fibrillation more often during stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (p less than .001) and infusion of norepinephrine (p less than .001) than during the control state in dogs treated with phenol alone. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation was highest in dogs with ligation-induced infarction that received phenol compared with all other groups during control (p less than .001), stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (p less than .002), and the infusion of norepinephrine (p less than .01). Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg or 10 mg iv at maximum) attenuated supersensitive shortening of ERP and decreased the incidence of induction of ventricular fibrillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Experience has reinforced our view that ATD implantation should be performed in what is essentially an operating-room setting, by a qualified team possessing the necessary surgical, electrophysiologic, and technical skills. ATD follow-up is different from that of conventional pacemakers and, particularly in the case of AIDS and AICDs, requires additional specialized instrumentation and more flexibility in scheduling.\r"

Palpation of the tongue base can be difficult without anaesthesia due to retching and vomiting. Computed tomography can, however, accurately depict the deep structures of the base of the tongue without discomfort to the patient. It can also demonstrate the nodal stations of the neck. In 12 patients with primary carcinoma of the base of the tongue the clinical staging results were compared with the CT findings. In 10 of the 12 patients there was good correlation between tumour size and location, while only 2 patients showed a 1.0-1.5 cm discrepancy in the size estimate of the primary tumour. A total of 9 enlarged lymph nodes or nodal groups were only found by CT. The majority of positive nodal stations demonstrated only by CT were in the contralateral neck. Computed tomography is a valuable complement when staging tongue base carcinomas, particularly when evaluating the neck for lymph node metastasis.\r"

Six ears had no membrane perforations and no severe disease of the tympanic mucosa. Twelve ears underwent primary operations for cholesteatoma and 23 ears had revision surgery. Good hearing improvement occurred in well-aerated ears while hearing in ears with extensive tympanic disease did not improve after surgery. No tissue reactions to the ceramic prosthesis were observed and no prosthesis was extruded.

Inlet and outlet pressures of the filter were measured at different blood flows to assess the resistance of the device and the end-to-end pressure drop. Hysolated ultrafiltration was performed to evaluate the spontaneous filtration at increasing blood flows, the ultrafiltration rate at different transmembrane pressures and, finally, the sieving coefficients for solutes. Standard hemodialysis was also performed to study the clearances throughout a 4-h session. During hysolated ultrafiltration the UF rate was increased up to 37 ml/min showing a very high hydraulic permeability of the membrane. The spontaneous filtration rates related to blood flow were quite low. Since the end-to-end pressure drop in the filter was also relatively low at high blood flow we may conclude that the geometry of the device is able to dissociate the influence of blood flow on the hydrostatic pressure inside the filter. This results in a easy modulation of the membrane permeability to water. Sievings were surprisingly high and clearances were stable along the dialysis session (BUN = 196 ml/min, creatinine = 161 ml/min and phosphate = 163 ml/min).\r"

Ten patients on maintenance hemodialysis took part in the study; all hollow fiber modules were equally well tolerated and no adverse reactions were observed. Using MC/RC/CA, mean clearances after 15 min of hemodialysis (HD) amounted to 162/169/150 ml/min for urea, to 143/143/124 ml/min for creatinine, and to 104/107/84 ml/min for phosphate (QB = 200 ml/min, QD = 500 ml/min, UFR = 0). Mean drop of systolic blood pressure was 6/10/8 mmHg and mean decrease of heart rate averaged 3/3/3 beats per minute, respectively, during the first hour of HD as compared to starting conditions. Residual blood volume in the modules after HD was low and heparin consumption identical for all 3 membranes (34 IU/kg X h). Mean peak C3a generation for MC/RC/CA amounted to 1312/3486/3099 ng/ml, respectively; leucocyte and platelet counts dropped to a minimum of 67/24/47% and 81/86/91%, respectively during the first hour of HD as compared to initial values. Elastase release from PMNL and platelet factor 4 from platelets showed no significant differences between the membranes. In conclusion, the new MC membrane showed a significantly better biocompatibility and equally good clinical performance as compared to RC and CA.\r"

  ".W": "Heparin has been used in clinical practice since 1936 as anticoagulant for: the treatment of thromboembolic disorders, the prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and the maintenance of blood fluidity in extracorporal circuits. Its use in these indications has been complicated by an increased risk of hemorrhage such as major bleeding during the treatment of pulmonary embolism and wound hematoma after surgery. Bleeding problems associated with the use of heparin in extracorporal circuits are the following: hemorrhages after cardiopulmonary bypass, serious hemorrhagic complications in patients treated with hemodialysis during acute renal failure and in patients on chronic intermittent hemodialysis and increased occult blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract and from other sites. The precise contribution of the use of heparin to the enhanced bleeding in these conditions has not yet been established. The effects on platelets, coagulation factors and/or fibrinolytic activity by the exposure of blood to foreign surfaces together with uremia present in hemodialysis patients may also contribute to abnormalities in clinical hemostasis. Recently heparin fractions and a heparinoid of low molecular weight (LMW) have been developed because of their potential to diminish the hazard of hemorrhage while retaining their antithrombotic properties. Preliminary reports from pilot studies have confirmed the increased efficacy in preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of some of the new LMW heparin(oid)s; however, improved safety with regard to bleeding still needs to be shown. The use of LMW heparins and of a new LMW heparinoid in acute and chronic hemodialysis has also been shown to be effective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Polymethylmethacrylate membrane caused markedly elevated plasma lactoferrin (712.5 +/- 165.9 ng/ml) and E-alpha 1PI (681.8 +/- 102.6 ng/ml). Lower levels were observed in patients dialyzed with cuprophan or polycarbonate dialyzers, while cellulose hydrate membrane caused a maximal increase of the E-alpha 1PI levels (1,6590 +/- 256.8 ng/ml). Polyacrylonitrile membrane provoked minimal E-alpha 1PI formation (267.6 +/- 79.6 ng/ml) but markedly elevated plasma levels of lactoferrin. However, polysulfone dialyzers displayed only very modest increases of the plasma E-alpha 1PI and lactoferrin levels. Plasma levels of myeloperoxidase were unchanged comparing the effects of the different dialyzers. We conclude that granulocyte activation during hemodialysis does not necessarily need anaphylatoxin formation.\r"

The success of this type of membrane for routine hemodialysis is related to a number of very useful properties with respect to performance, handling and biocompatibility. However, during dialysis Cuprophan membranes induce transient leucopenia which is closely connected with incidentally occurring pulmonary disfunction. These phenomena are thought to be complement mediated and Cuprophan has been recognized as an activator of complement. Synthetic membranes, such as PAN and PMMA show less complement activation than their cellulosic counterparts. Nevertheless these synthetic membranes cannot meet the performance quality of Cuprophan for routine dialysis and therefore dialyzers with synthetic membranes need special precaution to prevent excessive ultrafiltration. Consequently, research has been focussed on the development of a new cellulose-based dialyzer in which excellent performance suitable for routine dialysis is combined with improved biocompatibility. Two different approaches have been followed for the realization of this objective: The application of thinner membranes and The application of modified cellulose.\r"

In 1973, when the system was first introduced, the emphasis was on home hemodialysis. This motivation, combined with the relative portability and \"no need for plumbing\", led to the rapid introduction of the REDY System. Economically, the REDY System has not competed with central systems. However, the REDY System meets a special need for the preparation of individualized dialysate for the chronic and acute renal failure patient. Because of the small volume of the system (6 l), different dialysates can be readily prepared to adjust acid/base balance and normalize electrolyte concentrations. To simplify home hemodialysis, sorbent systems have now become available in which the dialysate side is disposable. This facilitates set-up and eliminates sterilization of the equipment. The Sorbent System can be reduced in size resulting in a continuously wearable hemodialysis system.\r"

The major drawback of hemofiltration as practiced today is the need to replace the large quantities of ultrafiltrate formed with sterile, pyrogen-free replacement solution. We have solved this problem by passing the ultrafiltrate through a sterile REDY Sorbent Cartridge to remove urea, creatinine and \"uremic toxins\" prior to returning it to the patient via a closed system. We have called this system SRUF for Sorbent Recycling of Ultrafiltrate and have carried out an A-B-A, B-A-B cross-over study (15 week periods) comparing SRUF with standard hemodialysis in 8 ESRD patients previously treated with hemodialysis. Clinical and laboratory parameters measured included: hemoglobin, hematocrit, blood transfusion requirement, electrolytes, aluminum levels, liver function tests, enzymes, lipids, glucose, cardiac function studies, weight, blood pressure, urea generation, urea space, incidence of hypotension and muscle cramps, and questionnaires on well being. The results of these studies can be summarized as follows: SRUF can be performed by the hemodialysis staff as a routine, outpatient procedure for ESRD patients utilizing the machinery and tubing developed as part of this protocol. SRUF, when used as a chronic treatment for ESRD patients, has no deleterious effects and is associated with many of the same benefits ascribed to routine hemofiltration, including improvement in well being, decrease in cramping and decrease in symptomatic hypotension during treatment as compared to hemodialysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using normal urine and the substances it contains as a reference, we have developed a wearable device capable of replacing both the renal excretion function and maintaining fluid and electrolyte equilibrium in uremics within acceptable biological limits. Our device includes a hemofilter allowing continuous plasma ultrafiltration and sorbents obtained from a Redy sorbent cartridge to treat 85% of the ultrafiltrate, whereas 15% of this UF is rejected untreated. After calculating the quantity of ultrafiltrate (about 13 l) containing an amount of waste products of metabolism equivalent to 24-h urine elimination, we determined in vitro the amount of sorbent required to eliminate these waste products from the ultrafiltrate (e.g., 20 g of urea/day) and we have evaluated the quantities of other substances which must be replaced using a tailored diet. This extra-corporeal detoxification process was used in a uremic patient who had been on traditional hemodialysis for the past two years. The continuous treatment permitted maintenance of fluid and electrolyte equilibrium at the desired level and allowed rapid improvement of patient clinical status: elimination uf nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and edema, which had previously reappeared during the interdialytic periods, as well as a rapid decrease in heart size as ascites disappeared. In addition, the patient regained sexual drive and the ability to have an erection. In conclusion, traditional hemodialysis and hemofiltration techniques allow intermittent elimination of products retained by the body and reestablish nearly normal fluid and electrolyte balance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This product irreversibly binds urea under mild conditions without formation of side products. Also creatinine is bound. The sorbent proves to be non-toxic, non-pyrogenic, stable, insoluble and resistant against acid and sterilization procedures. In combination with amongst others a sorbent for phosphate and potassium developed earlier, the urea sorbent can be applied in dialysate regeneration. In vitro experiments show that for dialyses of four hours duration less than one kg of urea sorbent can be sufficient. Also other applications, e.g., oral use are mentioned.\r"

Early results in small, uncontrolled studies were promising, but no large-scale controlled trials have yet been reported. The conditions for which well-controlled trials are now available are either diseases affecting a single organ-system, in which clinical abnormalities are readily measurable, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, or conditions in which serological abnormalities correlate closely with clinical disturbances, such as myasthenia gravis. Definitive answers are also available in rheumatoid arthritis, where many years of clinical experience have led to the development of well-validated indices of clinical activity. Many studies of SLE suggest that serological abnormalities, though important, are often not quantitatively linked to the clinical manifestations of the disease. Attempts to develop indices of clinical activity for SLE are handicapped by the range of different organ systems which may be involved. Progress in the development of clinical trials of plasmapheresis in SLE is most likely to result from multicenter cooperative groups, which will have the capacity to study large enough numbers of patients for adequate stratification, and from the development and validation of indices of clinical activity, which will make possible the quantitation of clinical response, and the measurement of the rate of accumulation of permanent organ damage.\r"

This has considerably hampered efforts to develop appropriate treatment. Only in rapidly progressive nephritis (RPGN) has clear progress been made as a result a radical improvement in prognosis obtained. In some forms of RPGN aberrant immunological mechanisms have been identified and their components characterized. The best defined are those in which auto-immune responses are generated and lead directly or indirectly to renal injury. As yet, only humoral auto-immune responses are easy to characterize in man; technical difficulties surround attempts to identify cellular auto-immune reactants. However, both can be investigated in animal experimental models. This presentation will focus on the more recent studies of the auto-immune responses in human RPGN and the possible contribution that these (together with those derived from animal studies) make towards a better understanding of the treatment of glomerulonephritis.\r"

At present ECBT is generally performed by using physical techniques such as dialysis, membrane filtration and centrifugation. These techniques are characterized by a low level of specificity leading to simultaneous removal of useful compounds. Administration of large quantities of substitution fluids (e.g., plasma-exchange, hemofiltration), is therefore often necessary. Higher levels of specificity can be obtained by using specific binders. Recent results obtained with synthetic polymers show the high potential of this technique. The use of biological substances, such as enzymes and antibodies, will enable an almost 100% level of specificity. It is obvious that the natural defence mechanism of the patient to be treated should not be triggered by the compounds used. This can be realized by either immobilizing the biological compounds on a solid phase, or by a physical separation between the compounds and the blood (e.g., by membranes). The former method seems more favorable since the efficiency will be optimal. The problems encountered, however, are numerous.\r"

  ".W": "During clinical hemodialysis, interactions between blood and dialysis membranes lead to the activation of several pathways such as the coagulation, kallikrein and complement pathways. The sum of these interactions defines the biocompatibility of the dialysis membrane; Cuprophane membranes, the most widely used dialysis membranes elicit intense blood-membrane interactions. Complement activation can be measured by determining the concentration of the activated third and fifth component of the complement cascade, namely C3a and C5a. These active products lead to the well known neutropenia seen during the early phase of dialysis. However, the neutropenia is only the most visible manifestation of the effects of complement activation. C5a-induced secretion of granule enzymes from neutrophils and their subsequent desensitization to further chemotaxis and phagocytosis may be an important factor in the incidence of infections in the dialysis patient. Endothelial cell damage by complement stimulated granulocytes mediated via superoxide anion may also play a role in the pulmonary dysfunction seen in dialysis patients, and recent evidence suggests that complement products may lead to cardiac dysfunction manifested by impaired ventricular contractility. Although some of these events may not be mediated directly by activated complement products, recent studies suggest that they play a role in the activation of several other pathways and pathophysiological process.\r"

For all dialysate glucose concentrations ranging from 70 to 198 mmol/l, an inverse linear relationship was found between the percentage of absorbed glucose and the ultrafiltration rate. In each patient a linear correlation was demonstrated between the dialysate glucose concentration and the quantity of body fluid removed by ultrafiltration. Therefore the dialysate glucose concentration without net removal of fluid could be calculated for each patient: DGCUF = 0. This DGCUF = 0 is a parameter of the relationship between the transport of water and glucose over the peritoneal membrane and can thus be considered a marker of the individual ultrafiltration. The calculated DGCUF = 0 was compared with DGCUF = 0 predicted from the glucose absorption using the equation as derived from our data: DGCUF = 0 (mmol/l) = 2.1 X glucose absorption (%) -67 (mmol/l). As marked day to day variations were found, the results of these predicted DGCUF = 0 should be interpreted cautiously when used for long-term follow-up of peritoneal permeability in CAPD patients.\r"

In order to get an insight into the function of the tubules, 45 patients with IgA GN have been examined for proteinuria with special reference to low molecular weight (LMW) proteins, also called tubular proteins using sodium-dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Thirty-seven of the 45 patients had proteinuria (200-1890 mg/day). On the basis of the middle molecular weight/high molecular weight (MMW/HMW) protein ratio, the proteinuria was non-selective in 28. Twenty-nine patients had 40-200 mg LMW protein/day in the urine. There was a statistically significant correlation between the tubulointerstitial changes seen in the renal biopsy samples (characterized by the tubulointerstitial index) and the tubular proteinuria. On the basis of these results it is suggested that in most patients with IgA GN there is, in addition to the glomerular lesion, also morphological and functional tubulointerstitial damage, which is in connection with the progression of the disease.\r"

HLA-type was examined in three patients and all showed B27 antigen but not DR3. No patient developed signs of systemic lupus erythematosus during the follow-up (mean 5.9 years). In two patients MGN persisted as judged from urinary abnormalities, one patient recovered after a relapse period and one developed secondary amyloidosis.\r"

Segmental collapse was seen in four of 179 hips nailed/pinned in situ and in four of 25 hips operated after reduction. This was the only early complication associated with problems at reexamination. Arthrosis was twice as frequent after reduction (53%) than after fixation in situ (24%). The clinical and radiographic results were better than those from the same region after other methods of treatment. Nailing or pinning in situ is the method of choice when possible, regardless of the degree of slipping. Bilateral slipping was found in 67% of the hips; therefore, prophylactic pinning of the contralateral hip is indicated in cases with unilateral slipping.\r"

A 29-year-old, obese man sustained multiple trauma, including a displaced transverse acetabular fracture. Extreme obesity made adequate exposure to the posterior acetabular area difficult, causing placement of a large lag screw in malposition, such that it penetrated the superior pubic ramus at a point adjacent to the superficial femoral artery. Angiography, immediately after operation, revealed extrinsic compression of this vessel. The lag screw was successfully repositioned, with immediate return of vessel patency and no sequelae. The surgical approach and anatomic landmarks for placement of posterior to anterior lag screws are reviewed in an effort to prevent this complication.\r"

Care of the open fasciotomy incisions, observation of the neurovascular status of the limb, and rehabilitation of the extremity were facilitated by internal fixation operations without subsequent external cast immobilization. The anatomic and functional results in this group were better than those treated with fasciotomy and cast immobilization. All fractures were united by 20 weeks. Complications in both groups were similar, although one deep infection, which was resolved with appropriate treatment, occurred in the group treated with internal fixation. Six open tibia fractures were treated with external skeletal fixation after fasciotomy; the results were less satisfactory, but the initial injuries were also more severe in this group. Patients with closed tibial fractures complicated by compartment syndromes should be treated expeditiously with fasciotomy, followed by stable internal fixation.\r"

EX-FI-RE is a unilateral, telescopic, single-frame device, consisting of two functionally separate components, the correction unit and the fixation unit. The correction unit allows reduction of angular, parallel, and longitudinal dislocations. Sustained transverse compression of an oblique fracture is a special feature. After reduction has been achieved, pin retainers and transcutaneous pins can be transferred to the fixation unit without change of position of the fracture fragments. Its mechanical behavior under load is analyzed and compared with that of a Hoffman-Vidal Adrey quadrilateral system. In axial loading, the two systems were similar within the loading range of 0-1000 N. In the anteroposterior plane, the stiffness ratio of the EX-FI-RE was significantly higher. In lateral bending and axial loading, the two systems were comparable. The turning moment required to induce a 5 degree angular deformation of the quadrilateral system was 4.8 +/- 0.6 Nm; the corresponding figure for the unilateral system was 8.8 +/- 0.4 Nm. After more than two years of clinical experience with this new device, closed atraumatic reduction, sustained transverse compression, and early weight-bearing were found to promote union. There were no pin tract infections or mechanical failures in more than 70 cases treated.\r"

Fifteen of 16 patients with normal nutritional parameters healed their amputations uneventfully, whereas 11 of 25 malnourished patients suffered either local or systemic postoperative complications. The difference in the complication rate between the nourished and malnourished groups is statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Malnutrition adversely affects the prognosis for healing lower extremity amputations, but it seems to be less detrimental to wound healing in the more proximal amputations, where blood flow is superior. Based on these findings, it is recommended that patients being admitted for lower extremity amputation should be screened at the time of admission, and those with laboratory parameters indicative of malnutrition should have elective surgery postponed until their malnourished state is corrected. Patients requiring urgent surgical treatment should probably receive supplemental nourishment in the perioperative period.\r"

At least 22% of the accidents occurred while the person was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Therefore, a wide range of residual symptoms (progressive or nonprogressive) could be attributed in part to abuse of drugs and alcohol. A permanent measurable loss of motion occurred following injury to the atlas or axis, irrespective of the modality of treatment. Cervical fusion created the greatest loss of motion and collar immobilization the least. Skull traction and a halo-vest were intermediate in patients with loss of motion, and the degree of loss of range was essentially equal. Residual symptoms, including pain, were found in 20% of those treated with a collar, 40% of those treated with surgical methods, 5% of those treated with traction, and 5% of those treated with a Halo-vest. Residual symptoms did not correlate at all with degree of displacement of the original fracture.\r"

Referred pain syndromes occur nearly twice as often and frequently mimic the clinical presentation of nerve root compression syndromes. Combined lesions occurred in 33.5% of cases. Lateral spinal stenosis and herniated nucleus pulposus coexisted in 17.7%. In 30% of the cases of spondylolisthesis, the radiographic findings were incidental and the source of pain was the sacroiliac joint. Distinguishing radicular from referred pain, recognition of coexisting lesions, and correlation of diagnostic imaging with the overall clinical presentation facilities formulation of a rational plan of therapy. The above-outlined approach to managing low back pain evolved over a 12-year period. Designed to establish a specific diagnosis, it should yield excellent or good results in 84% of patients.\r"

In tissue culture, BMP-HAP or HAP was used as substratum for rat mesenchymal muscle cell explants. The BMP-HAP and HAP controls were also implanted in the muscle pouches of mice. New cartilage and/or new bone formation was observed on the exterior surface of BMP-HAP but not of HAP controls. Implantation of this HAP into bone marrow cavities of rabbit femoral and tibial condyle produced new bone formation. The deposits extended further inside BMP-HAP than HAP pores. The pore diameters of 90-200 microns produced earlier ingrowth than into larger pore sizes. BMP-HAP should be tested for clinical application as osteogenetic biomaterial for augmentation of bone regeneration.\r"

In this study, a test specimen design and test regimen for quasistatic and fatigue testing of implant-porous coating shear properties was developed. Both cobalt-chromium (CoCr) alloy and titanium (Ti) bead-substrate interfaces of various surface designs were studied. Results showed that static bead-substrate interface properties for both titanium and CoCr specimens were superior to published values of bone-bead shear strengths. By comparison, fatigue tests showed that the strength of bead welds on a smooth substrate was inadequate, with a preferential failure site being between beads and substrate rather than between beads and cement or beads and bone. However, implant surface contours or a bead recess were found to protect the bead welds, and specimens with those features successfully withstood ten million dynamic loading cycles.\r"

The pharmacokinetic parameter estimates reveal rapid and extensive distribution (Varea) and a slow apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) (mean Varea = 3.59 L/kg and harmonic mean t1/2 = 23 hours). The harmonic mean blood clearance is 106 ml/min, the harmonic mean renal clearance is 3.9 ml/min, the mean hepatic extraction ratio is 0.089, and plasma protein binding is 86% to 89%. These results suggest that only the free (unbound) fraction of methadone present in blood is extracted by the liver and that methadone can be classified as a low (hepatic)-extraction drug. The data were fit to a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to obtain estimates of the steady-state plasma methadone concentration required to produce 50% of the maximum pain relief. This value varied from 0.04 to 1.13 micrograms/ml (mean = 0.29 micrograms/ml). These results indicate substantial interindividual variation in the relationship between changes in plasma methadone concentration and analgesia in patients with chronic pain receiving opioids. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model may be useful for the individualization of analgesic dosage and therefore the optimization of pain management in patients with chronic pain.\r"

Six normal subjects studied in a clinical research center each received a single oral dose of propranolol, 80 mg, and theophylline, 5 mg/kg, after having been on each of two well-defined diets for a period of 10 days. When the diet was altered from high carbohydrate/low protein to low carbohydrate/high protein, the oral clearance of propranolol increased by 74% +/- 20% (mean +/- SE; range 9% to 156%; P less than 0.01) with no change in plasma half-life or plasma binding. This dietary change resulted in an increase in theophylline clearance of 32% +/- 6% (range 18% to 50%; P less than 0.02) and a corresponding decrease in plasma half-life of 26% +/- 6% (range 6% to 42%; P less than 0.05) with no alteration in the apparent volume of distribution. These observations reemphasize the importance of diet in drug disposition and suggest that the clearance of high-clearance drugs like propranolol is more susceptible than the clearance of low-clearance drugs to dietary manipulations, effects that may have to be considered in drug therapy.\r"

The mean time of peak excretion rate was 1.3 to 3.7 hours for acetaminophen, its glucuronide, sulfate, cysteine, mercapturate, and methoxy metabolites but 13.5 hours for methylthioacetaminophen. The mean half-life of acetaminophen was 3.1 hours and the mean half-life of the metabolites other than methylthioacetaminophen ranged from 4.1 to 5.7 hours. The half-life of methylthiometabolite could not be determined because of its very late peak time. In a second study the effect of dose on the clearance of acetaminophen was determined in nine healthy adult subjects (eight men and one woman) who received doses of 0.5 and 3 gm acetaminophen on separate occasions, separated by 4 to 10 days. The renal clearance of acetaminophen and the formation clearances of the sulfate, glutathione, and catechol metabolites were lower (by 38%, 41%, 35%, and 46%, respectively) at the higher dose. The renal clearance of acetaminophen sulfate and glucuronide conjugates were not different between doses. In a third study (10 men), 10 gm N-acetylcysteine was found to increase the formation clearance of the sulfate conjugate by 27% and that of the glutathione conjugate by 10%. The data suggest that the hepatic supply of reduced glutathione and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate begins to be depleted over the range of 0.5 to 3 gm acetaminophen and that the depletion is overcome by the administration of N-acetylcysteine.\r"

Meptazinol, 140 and 280 mg, decreased body temperature. Valid relative potency estimates of morphine to meptazinol were obtained for self-reported liking, opiate symptoms, and pupillary constriction. Meptazinol did not increase euphoria or sedation scale scores but did increase dysphoria scale scores. In the therapeutic dose range, meptazinol produced miosis, morphine-like identification and symptoms, limited liking, and some dysphoria. Dysphoria predominated at the 280 mg dose of meptazinol. From these data, it is concluded that meptazinol is not a typical morphine-like drug and has limited abuse potential.\r"

  ".W": "Doxazosin is a new quinazoline derivative that, like prazosin, has selectivity for alpha 1-receptors. A three-way crossover, randomized, open study in 18 patients with essential hypertension was conducted to investigate the clinical pharmacokinetics of 2, 4, and 8 mg doxazosin at steady state. The pharmacokinetics of the initial 2 mg dose was also studied. Doxazosin showed linear pharmacokinetics. Increases in doses from 2 to 8 mg (steady state) produced proportional increases in doxazosin serum levels (maximum plasma drug concentration [Cmax] minimum plasma drug concentration [C min], and O-24-hour area under the curve [AUC(p-24)], whereas half-life (t1/2) (19.4, 18.7, and 19.7 hours, respectively), volume of distribution (3.4, 3.4, and 3.6 L/kg, respectively), clearance from serum (2.2, 2.2, and 2.1 ml/min/kg, respectively), and degree of protein binding (1.2%, 1.0%, and 1.0% unbound, respectively) were dose independent. Similar t1/2 and time to reach peak concentration (tmax) were obtained with 2 mg initial dose and 2 mg steady state. alpha 1-Acid glycoprotein levels were unchanged during doxazosin treatment. Doxazosin lowered supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The blood pressure reduction was associated with an increase in heart rate. Peak hypotensive and tachycardic effects occurred 5.7 +/- 0.1 hours after administration, whereas Cmax was achieved at 2.4 +/- 0.7 hours (tmax). Greater decreases in systolic blood pressure and increases in heart rate were seen in standing than in supine position. The reduction in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure with 8 mg was greater than with 2 mg (P less than 0.05); however, the increases in heart rate were not different. Dizziness, headaches, and dry mouth were the most frequent side effects. This study indicates that doxazosin shows linear pharmacokinetics between 2 and 8 mg and that because of its long t1/2, once-a-day administration should be adequate for the treatment of hypertension.\r"

Metformin and phenformin values ranged from 236 to 718 ng/ml and from 28 to 114 ng/ml, respectively. The plasma metformin level was correlated with triglycerides (r = -0.55; P less than 0.05) but not with drug dosage, plasma glucose, HbA1, creatinine, creatinine clearance, lactate, pyruvate, lipid, and clinical parameters. Plasma phenformin concentrations correlated with lactate (r = 0.49; P less than 0.05) and HbA1 (r = 0.50; P less than 0.05) but not with drug dosage, parameters of diabetes control, creatinine, creatinine clearance, pyruvate, and clinical parameters. The clinical usefulness of this HPLC method, the evidence that the increase of lactate is related to the circulating phenformin levels, and the demonstration that the metformin effect on triglyceride metabolism is correlated to plasma drug levels are the positive findings of this work.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a bolus dose of esmolol on heart rate, blood pressure, and PR interval in healthy, exercising male subjects. We gave a single esmolol bolus over 30 seconds to 13 men who exercised to a predetermined target heart rate. Each subject performed the exercise protocol twice, receiving a different dose between 10 and 300 mg each time. An additional eight subjects received two esmolol boluses 5 minutes apart while performing the same exercise protocol. Esmolol doses of 180 mg or greater caused a 13% to 18% decrease in heart rate, an 11% to 18% decrease in blood pressure, and a 13% to 22% prolongation of the PR interval. The median time to peak esmolol effect was 1 minute for heart rate, 2 minutes for blood pressure, and 4 minutes for PR interval. The median time required to recover 50%, 75%, and 90% of the decrement in heart rate was 8, 10, and 13 minutes, respectively. The rapid onset and disappearance of esmolol effects may make it an appealing drug in acute care settings.\r"

After a baseline period, verapamil or tiapamil were given by a primed-constant infusion in six of 16 subjects each, and hemodynamic changes were determined. Thereafter digoxin (1 mg) was concomitantly infused and hemodynamic changes were observed over 105 minutes. Control trials with digoxin alone were performed in seven of 16 subjects. Four of 16 subjects received only placebo. Digoxin provoked an increase in systolic blood pressure and splanchnic vascular resistance. Estimated splanchnic blood flow, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and total electromechanical systole decreased. Verapamil did not change basal hemodynamic parameters. Tiapamil decreased diastolic blood pressure and systemic and splanchnic vascular resistance. Both drugs attenuated the vasoconstricting effect of digoxin on the splanchnic vascular bed. Results indicate that calcium antagonists might be beneficial in treatment of digitalis-induced splanchnic vasospasm.\r"

  ".W": "Nicotine polacrilex gum is widely used as substitution therapy during cigarette smoking cessation. We studied circadian blood nicotine concentrations, daily intake of nicotine, and extraction of nicotine from gum in smokers switched experimentally to 2 or 4 mg nicotine gum, 12 pieces per day. Nicotine levels and intake were much lower while chewing gum than during ad libitum smoking. Extraction of nicotine from gum by the chewer was incomplete, averaging 53% and 72% for 2 and 4 mg gum, and variable (more than twofold) among individuals. The systemic dose of nicotine was less than expected based on analysis of nicotine in the chewed gum. Disproportionately higher metabolite-to-nicotine ratios while chewing gum compared with smoking suggested that some nicotine was swallowed and underwent first-pass metabolism. Nicotine and metabolite data were used to estimate buccal vs. gastrointestinal absorption. Relative buccal absorption vs. swallowing of nicotine appears to be an important determinant of systemic nicotine intake.\r"

To test this hypothesis, the disposition kinetics of intravenous nicotine were studied in 20 healthy smokers while smoking, after abstaining from smoking for 1 week, and (in six subjects) when smoking again. Cardiovascular responses to nicotine were also measured. Unexpectedly, total and nonrenal clearance of nicotine increased by 36% and 39%, respectively, during abstinence. The increase in clearance after brief abstinence suggests that nicotine or its metabolites or another component of cigarette smoke inhibits nicotine metabolism in smokers. Cardiovascular responses to nicotine were greater after 1 week compared with overnight abstinence, consistent with loss of tolerance.\r"

A steady-state perfusion technique in vivo was used to study proximal jejunal assimilation of isotonic sugar-saline solutions isocaloric with 140 mmol/l glucose. Endogenous alpha-amylase was excluded from the test segment by proximal balloon occlusion. The glucose oligomer mixture consisted mainly of maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose and maltoheptaose. Glucose absorption was significantly faster from maltotriose alone and from the glucose oligomer mixture than from 140 mmol/l glucose controls, whereas glucose absorption from 70 mmol/l sucrose was similar to that from 70 mmol/l glucose plus 70 mmol/l fructose. Hydrolysis in vivo of maltotriose, the oligomer mixture and sucrose were similar, indicating that capture of glucose released by brush border sucrose hydrolysis was less efficient than that associated with (1-4)-linked oligomer hydrolysis. This suggests that the stoichiometric relationship of the active hydrolysis sites for sucrose to the glucose transport system is less advantageous than that of active sites for maltose hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of oligomers larger than maltohexaose may be rate limiting for glucose absorption in the absence of luminal amylase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Of the 85 female marathon runners examined in this study, 14 (16%) had serum ferritin levels below 40 ng/ml but only two (2%) had iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin below 12 g/dl); 28 (33%) had serum folate levels below 4.8 ng/ml and of these two (2%) had haemoglobin levels below 12 g/dl and 13 (15%) had mean corpuscular volumes greater than 95 fl. One week after treatment with oral folate (5 mg/day) or iron (50 mg of elemental iron/day), serum ferritin and folate levels were normal but maximum oxygen uptake, maximum treadmill running time, peak blood lactate levels and the running speed at the blood 'lactate turnpoint' were not changed from values measured during an identical test performed 1 week earlier. These parameters were also unchanged in a third exercise test performed after a further 10 weeks of treatment. Serum folate or serum ferritin levels in a control (placebo-treated) group with initially high serum ferritin or folate levels fell with placebo treatment but maximum treadmill running time, maximum oxygen uptake values, peak blood lactate levels and the running speed at the blood 'lactate turnpoint' were unchanged. We conclude that biochemical evidence of iron and folate deficiency is relatively common in female distance runners; that 1 week of treatment corrects the biochemical evidence of folate and iron deficiency but that such treatment does not influence maximal exercise performance nor does it alter blood lactate levels during exercise. In the absence of iron deficiency anaemia, iron therapy for reduced serum ferritin levels, or folate therapy for low serum folate levels, may not improve maximal treadmill performance even in trained runners.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, the role of prostaglandins (PG) in protecting preglomerular vessels from ANG II constriction was examined in dogs with normal or non-filtering kidneys in which ANG II formation was blocked with captopril and renal artery pressure was servo-controlled at 75-80 mmHg. Before PG blockade (n = 6), ANG II infusion (20 ng min-1 kg-1) decreased renal blood flow (RBF) by 54 +/- 4%, but did not change glomerular filtration rate (GFR) significantly. After PG blockade (n = 6), ANG II infusion decreased GFR by 37 +/- 7% and RBF by 56 +/- 6%, while increasing calculated preglomerular resistance much more than before PG blockade. In another group of dogs, secondary changes in renal resistances, due to tubuloglomerular feedback, were prevented by occluding the ureter during mannitol diuresis until glomerular filtration ceased. After inhibition of tubuloglomerular feedback in non-filtering kidneys (n = 7), ANG II decreased RBF by 40 +/- 3% and increased glomerular hydrostatic pressure, estimated from stop-flow ureteral pressure and plasma colloid osmotic pressure, by 8.7 +/- 1.7 mmHg. Postglomerular resistance increased by 91 +/- 12% while preglomerular resistance was unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cardiac output was determined from the O2 uptake and the instantaneous changes in O2 and CO2 in the expired gas during the prolonged expiration. The mean values and the random errors (determined from the differences between pairs of estimates) of cardiac outputs in normal subjects at rest and exercise were 5.42 and +/- 0.60 litres/min (2 SD, 60 pairs) and 14.1 and +/- 1.8 litres/min (40 pairs). Larger random errors were obtained in a group of cardiac patients but, except in hypoxic patients, the mean values obtained by the single breath and the direct (Fick) methods were almost identical. We conclude that our modification of the single breath method is simple to use and sufficiently reliable for use in humans both at rest and during steady states of light exercise.\r"

When TPTX was carried out at 24 h before PH, TK activity at 24 h after PH was not reduced at all, yet TS activity was reduced significantly. Thus the effect of TPTX differed in time dependence between TS and TK. The depression of TK activity in rats which were subjected to TPTX at 72 h before PH, was recovered by Ca2+ supplementation. This result demonstrated that the rise of TK activity in regenerating liver is regulated by plasma Ca2+. Since a high dose of tri-iodothyronine (T3) was required to cause elevation of the activities of these enzymes and DNA content in 24 h-regenerating liver of TPTX rats, the relative contribution of T3 to liver regeneration may be small.\r"

Oil present in rice and particularly rice bran becomes ulcerogenic on storage and in this model results in a significant increase in the median (range) numbers of ulcers from six (one to ten) to nine (six to 15) (P less than 0.05). The ulcerogenic effect of stored rice bran oil was reversed by cysteine which significantly reduced the ulcer incidence from 100% to 60% (P less than 0.005) and the numbers of ulcers from 26 (six to 70) to one (zero to four) (P less than 0.001). Fresh rice bran significantly reduced the numbers of ulcers from six (one to ten) to one (one to four) (P less than 0.05). Similarly, unmilled rice and freshly milled newly harvested rice was also shown to be protective in this model by significantly reducing the ulcer incidence from 87.5% to 50% and 0% respectively (P values less than 0.025) and the numbers of ulcers from three (zero to 17) to one (zero to one) and zero (zero to zero) respectively (P values less than 0.001).

The decrease of ATP induced by the exercise test was significantly lower in the AMPD deficient patients than in the controls, but the decrease of creatine phosphate and the increase of lactate did not differ. There were no significant differences in the exertional performance level between patients and controls and no evidence was obtained of an increased energy expenditure per unit of performance in AMPD deficiency. The AMPD deficient individuals were equally capable of maintaining a high adenylate energy charge (EC) as the control subjects, which indicates a normal regulation of the balance between ATP consumption and ATP regeneration. ATP, ADP and total adenine nucleotide (TAN) but not AMP, were significantly elevated in the AMPD deficient patients as compared with the controls before as well as after the exercise test. This underlines the role of AMPD activity in the adenine nucleotide catabolism of skeletal muscle.\r"

Quadriceps needle biopsies, taken bilaterally at the end of the infusion, were analysed for muscle protein leucine enrichment with 13C.

Although accurate interpretation of cell-type is often possible at the light microscopic level, there are other occasions when electron microscopy may be necessary or useful. Furthermore, a familiarity with the ultrastructure of hematopoietic, lymphoid, and other cells should increase the pathologist's and hematologist's diagnostic acumen and, perhaps, even enhance his or her perspective at the light microscope level.\r"

Candida epiglottitis may be under-diagnosed and should be considered, especially in immunocompromised patients with symptoms of refractory pharyngitis. Treatment of Candida epiglottitis with intravenous amphotericin B is warranted in patients with sustained granulocytopenia. Prompt endotracheal intubation is indicated if the airway patency cannot be maintained.\r"

Five of the seven showed a bulging lesion, and the other two demonstrated an intrabronchial mass. We also examined these seven patients using selective bronchial arteriography. Herein we report our comparative study of the bronchoscopic findings and the bronchial arteriograms of these bronchial arterial lesions. The bulge observed in bronchoscopy corresponded either to an aneurysm or to a hypervascular area in the bronchial arteriogram. The mass lesions corresponded to a hypervascular area or a focal dilatation in the bronchial arteriogram. The intrabronchial lesions observed bronchoscopically either disappeared or were significantly diminished by bronchial arterial embolization for management of the hemorrhage. A histologic examination in two patients who underwent surgery revealed vascular lesions corresponding to the intrabronchial lesions in bronchoscopy. The results of this comparative study have important application in the bronchoscopic examination of bronchial arterial lesions in patients with hemoptysis.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac tachydysrhythmias occurred in 53 (22 percent) of 236 consecutive patients undergoing pneumonectomy. All patients had preoperative electrocardiograms which showed normal sinus rhythm. Patients did not receive digitalis before surgery. Atrial fibrillation was the most common dysrhythmia (64 percent; 34/53), followed by supraventricular tachycardia (23 percent; 12/53) and atrial flutter (13 percent; 7/53). No episodes of ventricular tachycardia were documented. Elevated concentrations of cardiac enzymes were associated with 12 (28 percent) of 43 tachydysrhythmias. Recurrent or persistent dysrhythmias were documented in 29 (55 percent) of 53 patients despite medical management or electrocardioversion (or both). Thirty-one percent (9/29) of these patients subsequently died during their hospitalization. There was no correlation between standard preoperative pulmonary function tests and the incidence of postoperative dysrhythmia. In addition, there was no correlation of dysrhythmia with postoperative diagnoses, surgical staging for lung cancer, postoperative arterial blood gas levels, or the fact that a completion pneumonectomy or chest wall resection was undertaken. An increased incidence of tachydysrhythmia was noted in patients undergoing intrapericardial dissections and those who developed postoperative interstitial or perihilar pulmonary edema. Twenty-five percent (13) of the patients experiencing tachydysrhythmias died within 30 days following their pneumonectomy. We conclude that tachydysrhythmias after pneumonectomy are associated with significant mortality, have poor correlation to preoperative pulmonary function, and occur more frequently following intrapericardial dissection and in patients who develop postoperative interstitial pulmonary edema or perihilar pulmonary edema.\r"

  ".W": "We studied eleven patients during 14 attempts at weaning from mechanical ventilation to determine whether central ventilatory drive, measured as airway occlusion pressure 0.1 s after onset of inspiration (P 0.1), during spontaneous breathing before and during a brief hypercapnic challenge, could accurately predict the success or failure of the attempt. All patients were recovering from acute respiratory failure and could breathe spontaneously for 20 minutes on a T-piece but were judged clinically to be marginal weaning candidates. Minute ventilation (VI) and P 0.1 were measured while breathing spontaneously and were repeated during a hypercapnic challenge that raised end-tidal PCO2 approximately 10 mm Hg. Seven of the 14 weaning attempts were unsuccessful, requiring reinstitution of mechanical ventilation. Although the failure group had lower mean maximum inspiratory force and higher spontaneous respiratory rate, no threshold value separated the failure from the success group. Ventilation increased more during hypercapnic challenge in those patients whose weaning attempt was successful, but overlap of results between the two groups rendered this test inaccurate for predicting weaning success. In contrast, successfully weaned patients had greater augmentation of P 0.1 during hypercapnia, expressed as the ratio of P 0.1 during CO2-stimulated to P 0.1 during baseline values, than did those who failed weaning (p less than 0.005). This ratio succeeded, and was thus both specific and sensitive as a predictor of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation in these patients.\r"

  ".U": "87160985\r", 
  ".W": "From 1976 to 1984, 656 patients underwent aortic, mitral, or double valve replacement with a Hancock or Carpentier-Edwards porcine bioprosthesis (POR; n = 293) or with a St. Jude bileaflet valve (SJ; n = 363). Recipients of the St. Jude valve were of more advanced NYHA class preoperatively, required smaller prosthetic sizes, and more often had associated coronary artery disease necessitating bypass grafting (p less than .05). Despite these differences, POR and SJ recipients demonstrated similar 30-day mortality (7.5 vs 10.2 percent), five-year freedom from embolism (92 +/- 2 percent vs 92 +/- 2 percent), freedom from all valve-related complications (79 +/- 3 percent vs 79 +/- 4 percent), and survival (72 +/- 3 percent vs 71 +/- 3 percent) (p = NS). Structural failures occurred exclusively in POR recipients (3.0-4.5 percent/pt-yr after four years), and endocarditis was more common (1.0 vs 0.5 percent/pt-yr); as a result, the reoperation rate was three times higher in POR than SJ recipients (1.4 vs 0.46 percent/pt-yr, p less than .05). Warfarin-related bleeding (2.5 percent/pt-yr) was the most common complication in SJ recipients, but occurred equally frequently in POR recipients requiring anticoagulation; seven (44 percent) of 16 valve-related late deaths were warfarin-related. In properly anticoagulated patients, the thromboembolic rate was low (2.0 percent and 1.1 percent/pt-yr, POR and SJ); this rate increased significantly in SJ recipients receiving antiplatelet drugs alone (4.2 percent/pt-yr; n = 16) or no anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy (26.4 percent/pt-yr; n = 18) (p less than .05), but increased only slightly in POR recipients (to 1.5 percent/pt-yr, n = 108, and 2.0 percent/pt-yr, n = 63, respectively). Postoperatively, NYHA class 1 was more often achieved in SJ than POR recipients (60 vs 39 percent, p less than .05), perhaps because of the better hemodynamic performance of the SJ valve. Thus, despite differences in patient selection and the nature of complications observed with each prosthetic type, porcine and St. Jude valves provide similar early and late survival, frequency of embolism, total complication rate, and freedom from valve-related morbidity and mortality after five years of follow-up. Limited durability, susceptibility to infection, and inferior hemodynamics remain drawbacks to use of the porcine bioprosthesis. The necessity for warfarin anticoagulation and the frequency of resultant bleeding complications are the major shortcomings of the St. Jude valve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

I studied physician estimates of survival for a patient with acute respiratory failure and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to identify the factors that may influence these estimates. Physicians (n = 205) completed the same patient management problem and estimated the length of survival for the hypothetical patient. Physician estimates of survival were quite variable, ranging from one month to five years. Shorter estimates of survival were associated with acquisition of select case information: subjective information from family members and a professional colleague, and physiologic and functional data previously demonstrated to be predictive of survival. The study suggests that estimates of survival for the same patient may vary among physicians because of different considerations of social and physiologic case information. Physician estimates of patient survival and treatment recommendations may become more uniform with additional education or decision aids regarding the prognostication of survival.\r"

Major serum immunoglobulin isotype levels (IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgG1-4 subclasses) were measured in 31 CF patients and ten control subjects. Immunoglobulin levels were related to airway infection with PA and the resulting IgG antibody response against PA lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Hyperimmunoglobulinemia G was present with elevated IgG1 and IgG2 in 48 percent, IgG3 in 52 percent, and IgG4 in 42 percent of CF patients. The PA infection was associated with striking increases in IgG2. IgG2 levels correlated well with IgG2 antibodies to PA LPS (r = +0.70, p less than 0.001). However, even CF patients who were not infected with PA had an increased prevalence of high IgG3 (p less than 0.05) and IgG4 (p less than 0.01). The PA infection thus appears to be a major, but not the only factor causing hypergammaglobulinemia in CF.\r"

Twenty-nine (34 percent) of the colonized patients died; four were female patients with fulminant bacteremia with P cepacia prior to death. Case-control studies showed that increasing severity of underlying cystic fibrosis, increasing age, having a sibling with cystic fibrosis who was colonized with P cepacia, and previous hospitalizations were associated with increased risk of colonization. In patients with mild cystic fibrosis, no differences in clinical outcome were seen during the period of study; however, patients colonized with P cepacia who had moderate or advanced cystic fibrosis were hospitalized longer and died sooner after colonization, compared with control subjects with similar severity of cystic fibrosis. The excess mortality associated with such colonization varied in magnitude and trend according to the patient's sex and severity of underlying cystic fibrosis, reflecting the combined influence of colonization with P cepacia, sex, and severity of cystic fibrosis on the mortality of the patients. The source and mode of transmission of P cepacia were not determined, but the data suggest a possible nosocomial source. The results of this investigation showed that colonization with P cepacia most often affected patients with moderate or advanced cystic fibrosis and was associated with an adverse clinical outcome in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine the prevalence of reported sleep disturbances in a general adult population and the relationship of these complaints to age, gender and coexistent obstructive airways disease, 2,187 subjects in the Tucson Epidemiologic Study of Obstructive Airways Disease were surveyed in 1985 regarding their sleep symptoms. At least one symptom of disturbed sleep was present in 41.4 percent of all subjects. Women generally reported a significantly higher prevalence of both disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS) and nightmares (NM)(p less than .001). Before age 64 years, the prevalence of complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) among men and women were similar. However, the frequency of EDS was significantly higher in men than women after age 64 years. Prevalence of at least one sleep symptom and DIMS increased with advancing age. The prevalence of nightmares appeared to be age-related only among women, who displayed a declining prevalence with advancing age. EDS increased only after age 64 years. There was a significant relationship between DIMS and EDS with coexistent chronic bronchitis, concomitant asthma and chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, but not asthma as a solitary diagnosis. Nightmares were reported with much greater frequency among subjects with asthma, asthma and chronic bronchitis, and emphysema but not in subjects with chronic bronchitis alone. The presence of coexistent asthma and chronic bronchitis was associated with particularly high prevalence of complaints of DIMS, EDS and nightmares. We conclude that, in the general adult population, sleep disorder symptoms increase with age and usually are greater in women. Furthermore, there is an increased prevalence of sleep symptoms among adults with chronic airways obstructive disease, especially those with coexistent asthma and chronic bronchitis.\r"

Perceptions of breathlessness in eight patients with anxiety disorder were compared with eight normal control subjects, matched for age and sex, by the application of Steven's law to the magnitude of resistive load test. All subjects estimated the magnitudes of resistive loads to inspiration while peak inspiratory mouth pressures were monitored. Anxious patients' perceptions of the added loads were significantly less sensitive than normal, even though the effort, determined by peak inspiratory mouth pressure, in overcoming each load was normal. Correlations between estimates of resistive loads and peak inspiratory mouth pressure were significantly less for the anxious patients than for normal subjects. Thus, perception of breathlessness in anxiety disorders may be affected by factors not normally associated with breathlessness and may help account for the greater than normal variability in resistive load perception in respiratory disease.\r"

Conduit repair would be necessitated by cases in order to expand the indicative criteria vertically as well as horizontally. For conduit material, we used consecutively nonvalved polytetrafluoroethylene that was reinforced by handmade stainless steel wire ring (Gore-Tex, Inc) or by spirally built-in stent (IMPRA, Inc). The latter was eventually useful in obtaining natural curving of the conduit without kinking or compression. Some contrivances in anastomosing a conduit were also proposed to achieve an excellent result. We believe these practical contrivances will serve for expansion of the indicative criteria and promise improved operative outcome.\r"

As a result, indirect calorimetry is frequently used to determine the REE. This technique, however, is neither universally available nor inexpensive. Furthermore, it requires meticulous measurements of gas exchange and technical expertise. Because of this, we have developed a method to determine REE for those patients in intensive care units who have thermodilution pulmonary artery catheters in place. This method requires determining the oxygen consumption from data obtained from such a catheter. The REE is then calculated by multiplying the determined oxygen consumption by the caloric value for oxygen (4.86 kcal/L at a nonprotein respiratory quotient of 0.85). We made 20 simultaneous measurements of REE, comparing our method with indirect calorimetry in 19 patients. There was excellent agreement between both methods (r = 0.90; p less than 0.0001). Therefore, for those patients in intensive care units who require thermodilution pulmonary artery catheters, this method will allow accurate determination of REE and thus caloric requirements, without the need for indirect calorimetry using measurements of gas exchange.\r"

Some of the clinical findings are similar to the sleep apnea syndrome, which could lead to incorrect diagnosis and delay in the administration of appropriate therapy. Transdiaphragmatic pressure studies on the subject's brother, who also has Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, revealed subclinical impairment of diaphragmatic function.

A prospective study was undertaken of 53 consecutive patients (28 men and 25 women, mean age of 21.4 years) with Wilson's disease. Electrocardiographic abnormalities occurred in 18 of 53 patients (34 percent), including left ventricular hypertrophy, biventricular hypertrophy, early repolarization, ST depression and T inversion, premature atrial or ventricular contractions, atrial fibrillation, sino-atrial block, Mobitz type 1 atrioventricular block, and tremor artifact. In contrast, 26 medical students and 14 carriers of Wilson's disease as control subjects (mean age of 22.6 years) all showed normal ECG. Eight out of 43 patients (19 percent) demonstrated asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension. An abnormal response to the Valsalva maneuver occurred in six of 18 patients (33 percent). There were two cardiac deaths; one died of repeated ventricular fibrillation (the copper content in the myocardium was 2.28 micrograms/g, and in the bundle of His 1.21 micrograms/g wet weight in the autopsy specimen); and the other, of dilated cardiomyopathy. It is concluded that four modes of cardiac manifestations in Wilson's disease include arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, cardiac death, and autonomic dysfunction. Such possible cardiac involvement should be added to the clinical picture of Wilson's disease involving the hepatic and central nervous system.\r"

Colostomy closure, whatever the antecedent disease or injury, required an average ten-day hospitalization, had no mortality, a complication rate of 0 to 6 percent, and an average hospital cost of $6,500. The hospital stay and costs for the total treatment were slightly higher for nontraumatic illnesses, although the rate of colostomy closure was significantly less (68 and 77 percent versus 86 percent, P = .05).\r"

Seven patients (17.1 percent) died, none of dehiscence of the colorectal anastomosis, although minor anastomotic leaks occurred in four. The median postoperative hospital stay was 12 days. Two patients developed peritonitis (one fatal) from leakage of ileal contents when the irrigating catheter was introduced through an ileotomy and retained postoperatively, and this aspect of the technique is not recommended. The operation offers a single-stage alternative for patients with unprepared or ill-prepared bowels who require resection of left-colon lesions. The results compare favorably with the authors' previous experience of two- or three-stage resections (in-hospital mortality rate, 42 percent).\r"

One hundred twenty-two patients (88 percent) underwent at least one definitive operation for the disease. Forty-four (32 percent) patients had proctocolectomies and 65 (47 percent) have ileostomies. Associated manifestations of Crohn's disease occurred in a high proportion of patients; perianal disease in 78 (56 percent), intestinal fistulas in 45 (32 percent), extraintestinal disease in 49 (35 percent). Six patients died of causes directly related to the disease. Specific complications tend to occur at definite times in the course of the disease. Crohn's disease is not a benign condition. There is a relentless progression of the disease and a high incidence of complications when patients are followed over a long period.\r"

A retrospective review of all colorectal cancer patients was conducted at the Southern Illinois University Affiliated Hospitals to determine the incidence of metachronous colorectal cancer at the authors' institution. In this study, a metachronous cancer was defined as a second colorectal primary occurring at least three years following discovery of the initial lesion. Between 1978 and 1984, there were 24 patients with metachronous colorectal cancer identified in an operative series of 707 patients for a frequency of 3.4 percent. These metachronous cancers were discovered at intervals ranging from 3 to 35 years. Sixteen (67%) metachronous lesions occurred 11 years of more after the original cancer. Synchronous or interval adenomatous colorectal polyps were noted in 17 (71 percent) of the patients. Thirteen of the metachronous cancers appeared in the right colon, while six were distributed throughout the transverse and descending colon, and five were in the rectosigmoid region. The incidence of late-appearing metachronous colorectal cancers and the propensity to occur in the right colon underscores the need for evaluation of the entire colon as part of lifelong follow-up of the colorectal cancer patient.\r"

Seventy-five (50.3 percent) of the patients developed new polyps. Although 61 of the 75 patients with new polyps were identified in the first two years, new polyps were noted throughout all four years. The presence of multiple polyps on the initial examination was statistically significant in predicting new polyps. The age and sex of the patients, size of the polyps, and the presence of atypia did not identify patients at higher risk for new polyps. The data indicate that new polyps are more likely to develop in patients who had a previous polyp. It would appear that annual examinations should be performed until two successive examinations are negative. Following a second negative examination, reexamination at two- or three-year intervals, unless symptomatic, would appear to be adequate.\r"

Reconstruction was performed four to six months later with Martin's modification of the Duhamel procedure. The postoperative course was uneventful and functional results are excellent three to eight years later.

Surgical therapy for the short-bowel syndrome is still largely experimental and cannot be recommended routinely. Thus, prevention of intestinal resection and conservation of intestinal length, when resection is necessary, should be emphasized. Strategies are presented that can be employed to preserve intestinal length when surgery is required in patients with a shortened bowel. These include strictureplasty, minimal resection, serosal patching, and intestinal tapering. In suitable candidates strictureplasty can relieve obstruction from strictures while avoiding resection. Minimal resection of involved intestine can be performed safely in selected patients with radiation injury or Crohn's disease. Serosal patching is an alternative to resection for the treatment of perforation or strictures of the intestine. Intestinal tapering can improve the function of dilated intestinal segments and eliminate the need for resection in intestinal atresia. The judicious use of these procedures can preserve intestinal length and obviate the need for long-term parenteral nutrition in patients after massive intestinal resection.\r"

Because of potential necrosis of the central bridge of tissue created between two longitudinal stapled lines in an S-pouch, the same techniques of stapling a J-pouch cannot be used in an S-pouch.

Intraperitoneal colostomy closure can usually be performed by mobilizing the colon at the stoma site without resorting to formal laparotomy.\r"

The variables associated with poorer five-year survival rates were advanced Dukes' stage, four or more positive nodes, blood vessel invasion, lymphatic invasion, circumferential involvement, and obstruction at initial presentation. As a group, patients with right colon cancers (cecum and ascending colon) had the best survival rates. When fistula formation or localized perforation had occurred, en bloc resection of locally involved adjacent viscera improved survival rates. These prognostic indicators aid in the selection of patients for wider colonic and mesenteric resections.\r"

Although many physicians have grown confident that their skills of visual diagnosis are adequate, few data exist to support this confidence. In order to examine the accuracy of physicians' judgments regarding colorectal polyp histology, the visual diagnosis of physicians experienced in endoscopy was compared with the histologic report. Eighty-one polyps were discovered by flexible sigmoidoscopy among 718 participants in a colon cancer screening program. Eighty percent of all polyps were detected accurately. The diagnostic sensitivity of detecting adenomas was 69 percent, while specificity (accurate diagnosis of hyperplastic polyps) was 86 percent, and there were an additional eight false negative and eight false positive diagnoses. Further analyses revealed that there are individual patterns of diagnostic mistakes made by physicians and that mistakes frequently are related to polyp size. These findings are particularly important in light of the expanding numbers of relatively inexperienced primary care providers performing flexible sigmoidoscopy whose diagnoses may be strongly dependent on polyp size.\r"

Mature inflammatory polyps were derived from polypoid mucosal tags after regeneration and the adjacent mucosa showed regenerative changes and submucosal scarring. The study confirms that ulceration which undermines the muscularis mucosae is the major precursor of inflammatory polyps.\r"

Two patients were diagnosed as an incidental finding after hemorrhoidectomy and the remainder presented with a symptomatic perianal rash (itching and moisture) that averaged two years in duration. Physical examination in these patients demonstrated characteristic lesions (seven with erythematous or ulcerated, whitish gray lesions and one with a papillary lesion). Three patients presented with invasive carcinomas and, despite aggressive therapy, all developed metastatic disease. Two patients had local excisions with minimal margins and developed associated invasive cancers at four and ten years after diagnosis. The remaining five patients were treated by wide local excision and skin grafts. At present all are free of disease. The characteristic appearance of this lesion and its failure to respond quickly to conventional therapy should lead the clinician to obtain a biopsy which readily establishes the diagnosis. Experience confirms that wide local excision is adequate therapy, but adequate initial evaluation and close follow-up are necessary to identify other malignancies that may develop.\r"

Animals were given intraperitoneal injections of vinblastine and sacrificed three hours later; counts of mitotic and nonmitotic cells were made in tissue sections, and three-hour accumulated mitotic indexes were estimated. The results show that, except at seven days in DMH-treated rats, cell proliferation was unchanged in the colon proximal to the colostomy. Morphologic evidence of hyperplasia was seen in some animals at seven and 14 days. The defunctioned segment showed rapid atrophy of both mucosa and muscularis and a gradual but progressive decrease in cell proliferation. The morphology of the mucosa adjacent to the suture line in both functioning and defunctioned segments in normal and DMH-treated rats was abnormal in many animals. Abnormalities that were seen included collections of dysplastic epithelial cells in the submucosa, focal adenomatous changes, and intramural carcinoma formation. Aggregates of lymphoid tissue often were associated with carcinomas.\r"

Five histologic lesions were quantified: liver cell necrosis, Mallory bodies, neutrophilic infiltrate, fibrosis, and fatty infiltration. The gradient between wedged and free hepatic venous pressures was significantly correlated with the degree of liver cell necrosis and the degree of neutrophilic infiltrate. The stepwise regression analysis showed that only liver cell necrosis has a significant and independent correlation for the degree of portal hypertension. The value for the gradient between wedged and free hepatic venous pressures was significantly higher in patients with (N = 48) than in those without (N = 36) acute alcoholic hepatitis (19.4 +/- 0.8 and 16.5 +/- 0.7 mmHg, respectively). Thus, histologic liver lesions observed in acute alcoholic hepatitis may play a role in the risk of complications of portal hypertension in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.\r"

This rate is lower than the prevalence of gallstones in northern or central European countries, but it is higher than that established in some southern countries of Europe. A comparison of the \"crude\" prevalence of gallstone disease was compared with that calculated for a similar 10-year period 100 years ago (1873-1882), on 1538 necropsies performed in the same town. Prevalence of gallstones rose significantly in a century (from a mean of 1.2% to 11.3%; P less than 0.001), a finding consistent with the concept that gallstone disease is a \"disease of civilization.\"\r"

Plasma zinc correlated directly with albuminemia (P = 0.01) and inversely with CDAI (P = 0.001). Urinary zinc excretion correlated with urinary 3-methylhistidine (P = 0.001) and plasma zinc levels (P = 0.01), and inversely with CDAI (P = 0.05). However, from multiple regression analysis, it was found that zincemia is influenced by CDAI and not by albumin, whereas zincuria is related to urinary 3-methylhistidine and plasma zinc, and not to CDAI. Our conclusion is that, in Crohn's disease, zincuria can be an index of zinc status when used together with measurements of lean body mass and turnover and factors influencing plasma ultrafiltrable zinc fraction.\r"

Eosinophil count was not significantly different in the acute stage between responder (6.36 +/- 5.95) and nonresponders (5.1 +/- 5.84) to medical treatment and was thus of little discriminatory and prognostic value. Mean (+/- SD) EC was reduced from 6.36 +/- 5.95 to 3.91 +/- 3.19 in responders after four weeks of medical treatment. There was little change in the EC with treatment in nonresponders. No correlation was seen between tissue eosinophils and clinical severity of ulcerative colitis. Mast cell count was not significantly different between patients with active ulcerative colitis, inactive disease, and controls and thus had little diagnostic or prognostic value. It can be concluded therefore, that EC in the rectal mucosa indicated activity but not severity of ulcerative colitis. A reduction in EC possibly indicated remission. Rectal EC, however, cannot correctly prognosticate the treatment response and outcome of the disease.\r"

Eleven controls, 16 patients with Crohn's disease, 13 with ulcerative colitis, and 3 with other types of acute bowel inflammation were studied (positive controls). Indium scanning was performed at 1, 4, and 24 hr. Fourteen of 16 patients with active Crohn's disease had positive scans but in only five was localization accurate. One patient had inactive ulcerative colitis, and the scan was negative. Of 12 patients with active ulcerative colitis, 10 had positive scans but disease localization was accurate in only four. Disease extent was correctly defined in 1 of the 3 Positive Controls. There was no significant difference in the accuracy of scanning at 1, 4, or 24 hr. 111In fecal excretion was significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in controls, and there was correlation between 111In fecal excretion and most of the indices of disease activity in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, 111In fecal excretion did not correlate with Truelove's grading but reflected colonoscopic assessment of severity. In conclusion, 111In-labeled leukocyte scanning lacks sensitivity with respect to disease extent, but fecal excretion of 111In correlates well with disease severity as determined by other methods.\r"

In control animals, electrical vagal nerve stimulation doubled the rate of endoluminal secretion of 5-HT and SP. Propranolol pretreatment did not alter luminal secretion of these hormones. Atropine suppressed motor function and induced dose-related inhibition of vagal release of endoluminal 5-HT, but not of SP; the response to hexamethonium pretreatment was similar to that of atropine. In contrast, superior cervical ganglionectomy did not alter stimulated endoluminal 5-HT release but it completely abolished release into the portal vein. The portal 5-HT release was not affected by ganglionic blockade. The data suggest that vagally mediated 5-HT release into the lumen and the portal circulation are mediated by different neural mechanisms, the former cholinergic, the latter presumably adrenergic; and release of feline 5-HT and SP are independent, suggesting two intestinal sources, the EC cell for 5-HT and peptidergic neurons for SP.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate amino acid administration, a stimulus of endogenous glucagon release, on canine hepatic bile flow. The experiments were performed utilizing cholecystectomized dogs with chronic biliary fistulas. The enterohepatic circulation of bile salts was artificially maintained by intravenous bile salt administration. Intravenous L-arginine stimulated endogenous glucagon release and hepatic bile secretion. Intravenous amino acid administration produced significant increases in hepatic bile flow and plasma glucagon and was significantly more potent than intravenous arginine. Intravenous amino acid administration produced small but significant increases in serum insulin but did not significantly change plasma concentrations of cholecystokinin. The results of this study suggest that endogenous glucagon secretion produces a choleresis and supports a role for glucagon in the physiologic control of canine hepatic bile flow.\r"

  ".U": "87161207\r", 
  ".W": "Patients with acute paraplegia from trauma have an increased frequency of developing gastric stress ulceration and subsequent hemorrhage. Current treatment of gastric stress ulcer is by antacids or H2 antagonists, but despite such therapy stress ulceration still occurs, probably because these agents are unable to maintain gastric pH above 4. Omeprazole, which blocks the terminal step of acid secretion--the proton pump, can produce long-lasting achlorhydria. This study examined the efficacy of omeprazole in preventing stress ulcer in rats with acute cervical cord transection. Omeprazole was administered intraduodenally at 1.725, 2.625, 3.5, and 17.5 mg/kg, and the ulcer incidence and gastric acid output were measured. Omeprazole produced a dose-dependent inhibition of gastric acid output in the cervical cord transected rat. At the highest dose, complete achlorhydria was achieved. The quantity of gastric ulceration was inversely proportional to the omeprazole dosage with nearly complete prevention of ulceration at the highest dose. In conclusion, omeprazole is very effective in preventing gastric stress ulcers in the spinal cord transected rat. This appears to be related to its potent long-lasting inhibitory effect on gastric acidity.\r"

Pancreaticojejunostomy was performed to induce decompression of the pancreatic duct. Histology of the pancreas showed advanced chronic pancreatitis. Three nonopaque concretions were obtained at operation. The largest one, which was milky white in appearance and elastic and soft in consistency, proved to be made up of protein. The concretion was rich in acidic amino acids, but poor in basic or aromatic residues. The molar composition of amino acids in the concretion was, in decreasing order, aspartic acid, serine, valine, glycine, and glutamic acid. Powder x-ray diffractometry revealed no crystalline structures.\r"

Complete evaluation led to the diagnosis of fatty cirrhosis associated with obesity and diabetic mellitus. She underwent four months of fasting with a protein-carbohydrate and vitamin-mineral liquid supplement to control her weight and metabolic abnormalities and to evaluate the effect of this diet on her liver disease. She lost 40 pounds to ideal body weight, normalized her serum glucose and lipids, and decreased total liver height by one third. Liver biopsy at the completion of her diet showed inactive cirrhosis and complete resolution of steatosis. Supplemented fasting with only modest weight loss can safely resolve fatty liver in obese diabetics with nonalcoholic steatosis and cirrhosis. Aggressive dietary approaches to achieve long-term weight loss deserve study in this subgroup of diabetics with unexplained chronic liver disease.\r"

Ten outpatients requiring chronic PA therapy for the control of ventricular dysrhythmias were evaluated. The resultant dose-adjusted data showed no significant difference between mean serum PA concentrations at any sample time, area under the serum concentration-time curves, mean peak serum PA concentrations achieved, or peak-trough fluctuations. Relative bioavailability was calculated to be 0.972 +/- 0.59. The Ascot preparation demonstrated a delay of 15 minutes before the onset of absorption; however, it also showed an earlier tmax in comparison to the Squibb formulation. Generic substitution of Ascot PA in place of Squibb PA may be implemented with significant cost savings.\r"

  ".W": "Therapeutic drug monitoring of aminoglycosides currently applies pharmacokinetic principles to maintain peak concentrations between 4 and 10 micrograms/ml and troughs less than 2 micrograms/ml. These predetermined concentrations are based on statistical rates of cure and incidences of adverse effects. At present, recommended serum concentration ranges for aminoglycosides (as with other antibiotics) do not specifically target the susceptibility of the individual organism, but compensate only for altered clearance due to diseases. The design of antibiotic regimens based on both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is called dual individualization. Logically, the pharmacodynamic parameters, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the organism and the postantibiotic effect (PAE), should also play a significant role in design of the dosing regimen. Simulations were performed to examine the consequences of designing aminoglycoside regimens considering both disease effects on excretion and bacterial susceptibility (MIC and PAE). The application of dual individualization concepts to aminoglycosides argues for a wider range of dosage requirements than observed with regimens that maintain desired peaks and troughs. If these concepts are accepted, some patients will clearly require more aminoglycoside than is currently used, and others can be managed with substantially less. The aminoglycoside therapeutic window, as it is now conceived, could be markedly different in the future.\r"

Patients were randomized to receive either placebo, ranitidine HCl 150 mg, or cimetidine HCl 400 mg upon rising on the morning of surgery. At induction, the cimetidine and ranitidine groups had significantly higher (p less than 0.05) gastric pH values than the placebo group. At extubation, the ranitidine group had a significantly higher (p less than 0.05) gastric pH than either the cimetidine or placebo group. Both H2-blocker groups had lower volumes when compared with the placebo group at extubation (p less than 0.05). There were more patients at risk for aspiration pneumonitis (pH less than 2.5 and/or volume greater than 25 ml) in the cimetidine group (46 percent) than in the ranitidine group (15 percent). All placebo-treated patients were at risk for aspiration pneumonitis. We did not find subjective clinical evidence of aspiration pneumonitis in our patients. We conclude that both ranitidine and cimetidine are superior to placebo, but ranitidine may be the preferred agent because of its more consistent effect on gastric pH and volume.\r"

Concerning qualitative analysis, (the ability of the information systems to provide citations in seven subject areas for the five drugs), IDIS was found to have the greatest overall utility and was statistically different from IPA in many subject areas. IPA provided few citations in the seven subject areas for the five drugs. On pairwise analysis, no differences emerged between IDIS and de Haen's.

Patients receiving the printed leaflet alone scored higher than patients receiving the verbal consultation; however, they scored lower than patients receiving both the printed leaflet and verbal consultation together. Patients receiving both verbal and printed information scored significantly higher than those receiving verbal consultation only. The findings suggest that printed materials together with verbal consultation are essential for enabling patients to make appropriate decisions with respect to side effects. There is not enough evidence to support the use of printed materials in place of verbal consultation. Health practitioners should use printed materials as an adjunct to verbal information.\r"

Treatment with 20-200 nM 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) increased the accumulation of cAMP by intact cells without altering growth, gross morphology, or DNA or protein content. The increase in cAMP accumulation could be detected 5 h after the addition of T3 and was abolished by the addition of cycloheximide. The maximum stimulation produced by prostaglandin E1 was increased in T3 cells without a significant alteration of the half-maximal concentration. T4 and D-T3 in concentrations up to 20 microM did not increase cAMP accumulation. Adenylate cyclase activity in response to forskolin, guanine nucleotides, and stimulatory hormones was increased in purified membranes from cells grown in T3, suggesting that increased adenylate cyclase is probably the major mechanism of the observed response to thyroid hormone.\r"

Using complementary DNA (cDNA) probes for rat IGF-I and mouse IGF-II, we have investigated the tissue distribution of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for these growth factors in adult rats. IGF-I cDNA hybridized with three groups of transcripts, 7.0, 1.8 and 0.7-1.1 kilobases, which were detectable in all tissues examined, with liver demonstrating the highest level of expression. IGF-II cDNA also hybridized to a number of mRNAs, the most abundant of which was 4.0 kilobases. Of the tissues examined, IGF-II expression was highest in the brain, barely detectable in the liver, and undetectable under the conditions used, in lung, ovary, testes, and mammary gland. These studies support the notion of paracrine or autocrine function for IGF-I and demonstrate tissue-specific IGF-II expression in the adult rat.\r"

  ".W": "Low levels of estrogen receptor (200-500 per cell) are present in the liver of hormonally naive male Xenopus. However, administration of estradiol results in a rapid 2- to 5-fold increase in cellular estrogen receptor content concurrent with the de novo transcriptional activation of the genes for the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin. Studies on Xenopus embryogenesis suggest that estrogen receptor induction is required for the activation of vitellogenin transcription. The purpose of the present study was to examine the mechanism of estrogen receptor induction in male Xenopus liver. The experimental protocol used 4-hydroxytamoxifen, an antiestrogen with a high affinity for the estrogen receptor, to inhibit the effects of estradiol. Changes in estrogen receptor content were then determined through the use of an exchange assay. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen alone suppressed the level of estrogen receptor from 800 sites per cell in hormonally naive animals to 250 sites per cell. Administration of estradiol 24 h after the antiestrogen resulted in the induction of estrogen receptor to a level equivalent to that found in control animals (800 sites per cell). However, under the same conditions, estradiol was unable to overcome the antiestrogen inhibition of vitellogenin gene transcription. Although 4-hydroxytamoxifen displayed a high affinity for the hepatic estrogen receptor, it did not inhibit the binding of estradiol to a middle affinity cytoplasmic estrogen-binding protein. These results suggest that different mechanisms are involved in the induction of estrogen receptor and vitellogenin gene transcription.\r"

  ".W": "Serum levels of 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone were assayed at 4- to 5-h intervals across the estrous cycle in female Djungarian hamsters, Phodopus campbelli. The pattern of secretion for estradiol is similar to that described for the rat and the Syrian hamster, rising slowly from a baseline of 54 +/- 2 pg/ml during the morning of estrus to a peak of 187 +/- 16 pg/ml in the early afternoon of proestrus, then falling rapidly back to baseline levels. The pattern of progesterone secretion is significantly different from that of any estrous cycle previously described for a 4-day cyclic mammal. There is no evidence for a significant peak in serum progesterone levels associated with ovulation and receptivity. The highest levels of serum progesterone occur during the early afternoon of diestrous day 2 (8046 +/- 1063 pg/ml). The lowest levels of serum progesterone occur in the early morning of proestrus (720 +/- 125 pg/ml). During the period of sexual receptivity only 2504 +/- 654 pg/ml progesterone are found in the serum. Ovariectomized females show behavioral receptivity after 48 h of treatment with 50 micrograms estradiol benzoate/kg BW in sesame oil. Progesterone is not necessary for receptivity and will not facilitate receptivity when administered in conjunction with a subthreshold dose of estrogen. The presence of tubular ova confirms the time of ovulation to be a period of approximately 7 h between 2200 h on proestrus and 0500 h on estrus. Histological examination of ovarian sections from each of the 4 days of the estrous cycle shows follicular development to differ from that in the Syrian hamster in that the total number of follicles in the ovary is variable and low, and the ovulated follicles (new corpora lutea) are blood filled. Djungarian hamster primary follicles averaged 83 +/- 2 microns in diameter, and preovulatory follicles averaged 455 +/- 17 microns in diameter. The total number of intact follicles per ovary rose from 21 +/- 5 on the evening of estrus to 73 +/- 29 on the evening of diestrous day 2, then fell to 32 +/- 26 by the evening of proestrus. Preovulatory follicles increased in number from 1.0 +/- 0.6/ovary early on estrus to a maximum of 4 +/- 1 on the evening of diestrous day 2. However, at ovulation a combined total of only 5.1 +/- 0.8 ova are shed.\r"

The effects of postoperative fasting were assessed by comparison of normal rats (N) with control rats (N6) pair-fed to match the caloric intake of the AU and RL rats. Surgical/anesthetic effects were determined by comparison of N6 rats with sham-operated pair-fed rats (S6). The effects of AU or RL were obtained by comparison with S6 controls. Changes in mean body weight attributable to fasting (N6-N), surgical/anesthetic effects (S6-N6), acute uremia (AU-S6), and regenerating liver (RL-S6) were: -17.3 (P less than 0.001), -4.0 (P = NS), -4.5 (P less than 0.05), and -1.0 g/24 h (P = NS), respectively.

The NP and CB receptor pools of the AU and RL rats were not significantly different from those of age-matched N rats (NP, 25 +/- 5 fmol/mg DNA; CB, 405 +/- 134 fmol/mg DNA).

Complete starvation for 24 h (NO) or 72 h (NOO) generally resulted in marked reductions in receptor concentrations compared to those in age-matched N rats fed ad libitum: NP pool (N, 31 +/- 17 fmol/mg DNA): NO-N, -40% (P = NS); NOO-N, -59% (P less than 0.01); CB pool (N, 303 +/- 105 fmol/mg DNA): NO-N, -19% (P less than 0.05); NOO-N, -41% (P less than 0.001). These studies indicate that severe AU, moderate CU, and LR have relatively little effect on solubilized rat liver nuclear receptor concentrations. In contrast, complete starvation is a potent depressant of both nuclear receptor pools. In the surgical models of AU and LR, postoperative fasting was the primary cause of weight loss.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although the precise role of relaxin has yet to be elucidated, it has been implicated in the regulation of physiological and biochemical processes in the reproductive tract during pregnancy and parturition. In this study, the growth-promoting effects of relaxin and related compositional changes in the uterus, cervix, and vagina of immature ovariectomized estrogen-primed rats were examined. Relaxin increased the wet weight of the uterus, cervix, and vagina in a significant and linear manner over the log of the dose range (1-30 micrograms; 6 h). The increase in uterine weight was due to increases in both dry weight and water content at all doses. A dose of 1 microgram relaxin induced maximal increases in dry weights in the cervix and vagina over control values; higher doses increased wet weight, but these changes were due solely to increases in water content. Thirty micrograms of relaxin were found to increase total soluble protein and glycogen content of the vagina above control values after 6 h. Relaxin did not alter the total collagen levels of the uterus or cervix, and collagen concentrations were significantly reduced in these organs 6 and 24 h after treatment. Total glycosaminoglycan levels were elevated by relaxin in the uterus (6 h) and cervix (24 h). Total vaginal collagen was increased 24 h after relaxin injection, but the collagen concentration was decreased over the time interval studied, and glycosaminoglycan levels in the vagina were unaltered. In summary, relaxin stimulates growth of the uterus, cervix, and vagina by increasing water content and tissue mass. The increases in distensibility that relaxin induces in these organs appear to be related to changes in the fluid matrix and proteoglycan metabolism rather than alterations in collagen concentration, at least 6-24 h after a single injection. These results support the hypothesis that relaxin plays a significant role in the maintenance of pregnancy through its contribution to fetal accommodation and in the facilitation of parturition through expansion of the entire birth canal.\r"

  ".W": "A cDNA library, prepared from mRNA isolated from the uteri of 3-day estradiol-stimulated immature rats, was constructed in pBR322. From this library an estrogen-regulated clone, pERU3, was isolated. This clone contained sequences complementary to uterine mRNA that migrated during gel electrophoresis as a double band of about 5.0 and 5.8 kilobases. Little of this mRNA was seen in several other tissues examined. An increase in the amount of this RNA in uterus was seen 2 h after estradiol treatment, with maximum hybridization occurring, in different experiments, between 18 and 36 h, followed by a decline. Hybridization of the cDNA insert of the pERU3 plasmid with known probes indicated that it coded for alpha 1(I)-procollagen. This conclusion was supported by in vitro translation experiments in which the hybrid-selected mRNA complementary to pERU3 DNA was shown to code for a collagenase-sensitive protein with a size corresponding to that of alpha 1(I)-procollagen. This system, therefore, provides an additional tool for the study of the estrogen regulation of gene expression in the uterus.\r"

The effect of this treatment on increased muscle protein breakdown in the hyperthyroid state is not known. In the present study, experimental hyperthyroidism was induced in rats by daily ip injections of T3 (100 micrograms/100 g BW) during a 10-day period. Control animals received corresponding volumes of solvent. In groups of rats the selective beta-1-blocking agent metoprolol or the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol was infused by miniosmotic pumps implanted sc on the backs of the animals. Protein degradation was measured in incubated intact soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles by determining tyrosine release into the incubation medium. The protein degradation rate in incubated extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles was increased by 50-60% during T3 treatment. Metoprolol or propranolol did not influence muscle protein breakdown in either T3-treated or control animals. The results suggest that T3-induced increased muscle proteolysis is not mediated by beta-receptors, and muscle weakness and wasting in hyperthyroidism might not be affected by beta-blockers.\r"

Testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or 17 beta-estradiol (E2) (10(-9) -10(-9) M) were added to primary culture of epiphyseal articular chondrocytes. They showed an age-dependent stimulatory effect on [35S]sulfate incorporation into newly synthesized proteoglycans. In cultured rabbit fetal cartilage cells, the maximum active concentration of T and DHT was 10(-9) M with a 40% stimulating effect over control values. E2 was even more active with 80% stimulating effect when added at 10(-8) M. Chondrocytes from animals aged up to 5 days responded poorly and those from animals aged 5-30 days not at all. The response of cells from older animals varied with animal age and sex. T and DHT stimulated chondrocytes from males aged 32-55 days and females aged 40-52 days to about the same extent. E2 stimulated cells from animals of the same ages, but the response of female-derived cells was twice that of male-derived cells. The stimulating effect was dose dependent from 10(-11) to 10(-8) M and maximal at 10(-9) M for T and DHT and at 10(-8) M for E2. Puromycin completely abolished the effect.\r"

  ".W": "The conversion of T4 to T3 in the brain and anterior pituitary gland contributes significantly to the T3 content of these tissues and appears to be an important modulator of thyroid hormone action. In the present study, the antimanic agent lithium was demonstrated in cultured neural and pituitary tissue to have a significant inhibitory effect on the activity of low Km (type II) iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (I5'D), the enzyme mediating T3 formation. At medium lithium concentrations of 3.3-5 mM, 15'D activity was decreased 44 +/- 3% (P less than 0.001) in the NB41A3 mouse neuroblastoma cell line and 48 +/- 2% (P less than 0.001) in the GH3 rat pituitary tumor cell line. This inhibitory effect was only observed in intact cells. Significant inhibition of this enzymatic process was also noted in the anterior pituitary gland of thyroidectomized rats injected 3-24 h earlier with either 4 or 10 mmol/kg BW LiCl. This decrease in low Km I5'D activity was accompanied by significant decreases in the serum T3 concentration and the pituitary nuclear T3 content. Renal high Km (type I) I5'D activity was unaffected by lithium administration. These studies demonstrate that lithium, an agent of proven therapeutic benefit in patients with manic-depressive illness, can affect changes in T4 metabolism and cellular T3 content in neural and anterior pituitary tissue. Given the prominent mood changes that occur in patients with disordered thyroid function, this finding suggests that the therapeutic benefits of lithium in affective illness may be derived in part from alterations in thyroid hormone economy in the brain.\r"

  ".U": "87161597\r", 
  ".W": "The hormone-binding components of the rat uterine progesterone receptor were investigated by the methods of [3H]R5020 photoaffinity labeling and sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Two specifically labeled peaks were observed at mol wt of 85,600 +/- 1,200 and 109,600 +/- 1,200 (n = 31), resembling the A and B progesterone receptor components previously described in other systems. However, in contrast to the equimolar ratio reported in other systems, the level of subunit A observed was consistently greater than that of B (A/B ratio = 3.2 +/- 0.3; n = 31). The unusual A/B ratio prompted a complete validation of the photolabeling procedure in this system. Although the levels of specific binding increased, there was no change in the A/B ratio with varying [3H]R5020 concentrations (5-80 nM) or with time of UV exposure (0.5 min to 3 h). Although adsorption to hydroxylapatite indicated that specific [3H]R5020 binding was reduced by 72.0 +/- 6.4% within 5 min of UV exposure, relabeling the irradiated preparations with [3H]R5020 resulted in little change in specific [3H]R5020 binding. TLC analysis of [3H]R5020 (Rf = 0.48 +/- 0.01; n = 4) after irradiation demonstrated rapid photolysis resulting in a 94.3 +/- 2.5% (n = 3) loss of authentic [3H]R5020 within 5 min. After photolysis, at least two new tritiated products were recovered with Rf values of 0.20 +/- 0.03 and 0.72 +/- 0.02. Analysis by adsorption to hydroxylapatite indicated that the photolysis products competed for specific [3H]R5020-binding sites in cytosol with only 10-fold lower relative binding activity than authentic R5020. Thus, these compounds probably account for the increase in specific photolabeling of the A and B peaks achieved when UV exposure is prolonged from 5 to 30 min. Further study indicated that the A/B subunit ratio in this system was not changed under a variety of in vitro conditions, including the absence or presence of molybdate, sulfhydryl protective reagents (dithiothreitol and thioglycerol), protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and leupeptin), glycerol (0%, 10%, and 30%, vol/vol), or 1.5 mM EGTA, or after precipitation with 40% ammonium sulfate. This consistency of the A/B ratio under a wide variety of adverse in vitro conditions suggests that in vitro artefacts may not account for the ratio's deviation from unity. Estrogen withdrawal (48 h) enhanced by progesterone treatment (0.5 mg for 24 h) resulted in only a modest reduction in the A/B ratio to 1.9 +/- 0.1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Structure-activity investigations showed that for the lipolytic action of beta-endorphin the C-terminal part [longer than beta-endorphin-(27-31)] is relatively important. Of special importance seems to be the C-terminal amino acid residue, because none of the sequences lacking the last two amino acid residues was lipolytically active. Furthermore, a different lipolytic response to beta-endorphin was obtained in starved, ad libitum-fed, and starved-refed animals, showing that the regulation of the lipolytic potency is not only mediated by peptide concentrations in the medium.\r"

We measured the ability of these tumors to aromatize testosterone (T) to E2 by two methods. First, tumor minces were incubated with [7-3H]T, and the resultant [3H]E2 and [3H]estrone were purified and measured. In addition, tumor cell cultures were incubated with [1 beta-3H]T, and the resultant [3H]H2O was determined as a measure of aromatization. Tumor minces aromatized more actively than normal rat testicular tissue (3.30 +/- 0.15% of the T added was converted to E2 by the tumor vs. 0.30 +/- 0.25% by normal testis). Most of the aromatizing actitivity was localized to the microsomes. Using cell cultures the maximum velocity was 6.1 pmol/h X 5 X 10(5) cells, and the Km was 98 nM. In neither minces nor cell cultures were we able to show stimulation of aromatization with hCG, (Bu)2cAMP, or phorbol esters, although we could show stimulation by these agents in normal testicular cells. We were unable to inhibit the aromatase activity with human beta-endorphin or stimulate it with naloxone. However, we were able to inhibit the aromatase activity with 4-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,17-dione. We conclude that the LTW(m) rat Leydig cell tumor has an active autonomous aromatase system that is not responsive to compounds affecting the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system. It can be inhibited by 4-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,17-dione, a competitive-suicide inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme(s).\r"

  ".W": "A tonic inhibition of LH release by endogenous opiate systems is apparent after administration of opiate antagonists to ovariectomized estrogen-progesterone-primed rats. In the presence of a serotonin agonist, morphine has been found to stimulate LH release in ovariectomized animals. Thus, in the present study the individual effects as well as interactions of the opiate and serotonin (5HT) systems have been examined using morphine and quipazine, respectively, as agonists and ketanserin (5HT2) and methysergide (5HT1 and 5HT2) as antagonists. Rats ovariectomized 2-4 weeks beforehand were primed with estradiol benzoate (15 micrograms; day 0) and progesterone (5 mg; day 2). Serial blood samples were collected from unrestrained rats via a jugular cannula inserted 3 days before, and plasma LH was measured by RIA. Neither morphine (4 mg sulfate) nor quipazine (2 mg/kg) administered iv at 1200 h significantly elevated plasma LH at 1210, 1220, or 1230 h compared to levels at 1200 h, although plasma LH concentrations at these times were significantly greater than those in animals receiving saline at 1200 h. However, injection of both morphine and quipazine at 1200 h greatly augmented LH release at 1210, 1220, and 1230 h compared to the response to either drug alone. The duration of the significant elevation of plasma LH was limited to 10 min by ketanserin (2.5 mg/kg, ip, at 0900 h) and to 20 min by methysergide (10 mg/kg, ip, at 0900 h), suggesting mediation of this response by 5HT2 receptors. These results suggest the possibility of an important interaction between opiate and serotonergic systems in controlling the release of LH and raise the intriguing question of its role, if any, in controlling events of the estrous cycle.\r"

  ".W": "The activation of protein kinase C and adenylate cyclase in the regulation of human CG (hCG) synthesis by cultured BeWo choriocarcinoma cells was studied. Both cholera toxin (CT), which activates adenylate cyclase, and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a protein kinase C activator, stimulated the secretion of hCG in a dose-dependent manner. During a 72-h culture, stimulation with the maximal effective concentration of CT (1.0 ng/ml) exerted a more pronounced increase (16-fold) in hCG synthesis than TPA (10 ng/ml) (2.8-fold), whereas the inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (100 ng/ml) was ineffective. When added together, TPA potentiated the effect of CT on hCG secretion (from 16- to 27-fold) and cAMP accumulation (from 36- to 54-fold) in the medium. TPA (1.0 ng/ml) also caused a 2.0-fold increase in basal cAMP production after 72 h. Time-course studies indicated that the effect of TPA on CT-induced cAMP and hCG productions became significant at 45 min and 6 h, respectively, from the beginning of stimulation. Proliferation of cells was not responsible for the responses, since the treatments only slightly increased the total protein content and did not alter the rate of incorporation of C3H3-methylated thymidine of the cells. Our results demonstrate that TPA potentiates CT-induced cAMP and hCG production in cultured human choriocarcinoma cells.\r"

  ".W": "The beta-adrenergic and glucagon receptor-binding capacities in rat livers from 6-27 months of age were measured to investigate the mechanism of a previously observed rise in beta-adrenergic stimulated adenylate cyclase with increasing age. There was no concomitant increase in glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase. In the present study neither glucagon-binding capacity nor glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase changed with age. In contrast, the beta-adrenergic receptor capacity, measured in the same membranes by [125I]iodopindolol binding, increased nearly 3-fold from 6.6 +/- 0.6 fmol/mg at 6 months to 19.1 +/- 3.3 fmol/mg at 18-19 months. The increase was directly proportional to the maximum isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in livers of rats up to 19 months of age. By 24-27 months the binding capacity had increased to 24.9 +/- 3.3 fmol/mg, but there was no further increase in adenylate cyclase activity. Thus, there appeared to be a beta-receptor-adenylate cyclase uncoupling in livers from the senescent animals (25-27 months). The defect could not be demonstrated by studies examining isoproterenol competition of [125I]iodopindolol from agonist-induced high affinity sites on the membranes, a procedure that examines receptor-Ns protein coupling. Activation of adenylate cyclase by the nonhormonal stimulators F- and forskolin did not change with age, indicating that the catalytic unit was not a limiting factor. Since the relationship between the glucagon receptor and adenylate cyclase also remained unaltered, the uncoupling apparently lies in an alteration of the interaction between the beta-adrenergic receptor and the guanine nucleotide-sensitive Ns protein.\r"

  ".W": "The interactive effects of androgen exposure during neonatal and adult life on the pattern of GH secretion in adult male rats was investigated. Neonatal rats were orchidectomized or sham-operated on days 1-2 of life and injected immediately postoperatively with testosterone propionate (250 micrograms, sc) or vehicle. At 90-130 days of age the rats were bled every 20 min between 9 and 17 h from an indwelling intraatrial catheter. Some neonatally gonadectomized, testosterone- or vehicle-treated rats were also given depot testosterone (15 mg/kg, im) 5-10 days before blood sampling. Plasma GH concentrations were measured by RIA, and the pulsatile secretory patterns were analyzed by the PULSAR computer program. Neonatal orchidectomy resulted in a marked suppression (50-75%) of both the height and duration of GH secretory episodes, while baseline GH levels were higher in neonatally gonadectomized males than in sham-operated controls. Neonatal testosterone replacement therapy restored high amplitude GH pulses. However, the GH pulses of these animals were of significantly shorter duration and occurred more frequently, and baseline GH levels were markedly higher than those in intact male rats. In contrast, neonatally gonadectomized rats treated with testosterone both neonatally and during adulthood exhibited a GH pattern indistinguishable from that in normal males, with high amplitude and long-lasting (103 +/- 8 min) pulses at regular intervals (178 +/- 9 min). A similar masculine GH pattern was seen in neonatally gonadectomized rats given testosterone only during adult life. The present results indicate that high amplitude GH pulses can be induced by either neonatal or adult androgen exposure. However, while neonatal androgens irreversibly cause stimulation of overall GH secretion, only the continuous presence of androgens during adult life can induce a GH secretory pattern, consisting of large surges at regular 3-h intervals separated by a low baseline that is characteristic of normal male rats.\r"

  ".W": "The rat intermediate pituitary lobe is one of the rare tissues that is not a known glucocorticoid target and is devoid of immunoreactive glucocorticoid receptor. The intermediate lobe is poorly vascularized and receives a dopaminergic and serotonergic innervation from the hypothalamus. In previous studies we demonstrated that removal of this hypothalamic input results in the appearance of immunoreactive glucocorticoid receptor in the intermediate lobe, as demonstrated with the use of in vitro intermediate pituitary cultures and two in vivo experimental situations. We now show that this appearance of the glucocorticoid receptor is presumably due to removal of hypothalamic dopamine from the intermediate lobe cells, since in this study dopamine (or its potent agonist bromocriptine) inhibits expression of the glucocorticoid receptor in intermediate pituitary cells in primary culture, as demonstrated by [3H] dexamethasone binding and immunocytochemistry. The dopamine antagonist haloperidol blocks the inhibitory effects of the dopamine agonist. In contrast to the intermediate pituitary cells, bromocriptine does not affect glucocorticoid receptor expression in anterior pituitary cells in culture. The differential dopaminergic regulation of glucocorticoid receptor expression in the pituitary gland raises questions about possible effects of dopamine on glucocorticoid receptor levels and glucocorticoid response in other dopamine target tissues, especially in the brain.\r"

  ".U": "87161613\r", 
  ".W": "We have analyzed the factors responsible for the circadian variation in rat hepatic mRNA-S14. Regulation of this sequence, which is found in lipogenic tissues and encodes a protein (S14) believed to be associated with fatty acid synthesis, is an excellent model of the interaction of thyroid hormone and dietary factors at the hepatocellular level. The mRNA exhibits a 3-fold diurnal variation (peak, approximately 2000 h; nadir, 0800 h) in ad libitum feeding rats on a 12-h light, 12-h dark photoschedule. We studied the effects of the photoschedule, periodic food intake, hypophysectomy, and induction by thyroid hormone (T3) on the mRNA-S14 rhythm. Adaptation to feeding restricted to either light or dark periods for 15 days did not greatly affect the diurnal rhythm. Photoreversal resulted in a 180 degrees phase shift, whereas the rhythm persisted in the presence of constant light. Oscillation continued around a higher baseline after a receptor-saturating dose of T3 in both normal and hypophysectomized rats. Our results indicate primary entrainment of the mRNA-S14 diurnal rhythm to the photoperiod, rather than to periodic food intake. Moreover, the circadian regulatory signal, which probably originates in the central nervous system, appears capable of antagonizing a maximal T3-inductive stimulus and does not originate in the pituitary gland. Persistence of the oscillation in constant light rules out circulating melatonin as the mediator. Synchronization of the rhythm by the photoschedule suggests that neuroendocrine factors are important determinants of rhythmic changes in hepatic gene expression.\r"

  ".U": "87161615\r", 
  ".W": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been identified in axon terminals innervating neurons of the supraoptic nucleus and has been shown to inhibit the electrical activity of supraoptic neurons when applied iontophoretically. This study examines the effects of GABA and GABA antagonists on vasopressin (VP) release from organ-cultured explants of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS). The GABA antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin stimulated VP release in a concentration-dependent manner. These observations suggest that VP release by HNS explants is tonically inhibited by GABA. Exposure of HNS explants to GABA (10(-8)-10(-3) M) did not consistently alter basal VP release. This was true even when penicillin, which can block GABA-activated chloride channels, was omitted from the medium. Similarly, nipecotic acid, an agent that potentiates GABA activity by inhibiting GABA uptake, did not alter basal VP release; stimulation of VP release by acetylcholine and increases in osmolality was not diminished by the addition of 10(-5) M GABA. The failure of exogenous GABA to modify basal and stimulated VP release suggests that GABAergic inhibition of VP release is maximally activated by endogenously released GABA in cultured HNS explants. This is consistent with evidence for a local source of GABA in the supraoptic nucleus and suggests that one role of GABA in the regulation of VP release is that of a potent local inhibitory neurotransmitter.\r"

  ".W": "The membrane response of isolated rat glomerulosa cells to the application of angiotensin II (A II) has been studied using intracellular voltage measurements. The membrane response is biphasic. The first, brief phase involves an increase in membrane conductance and a hyperpolarization from the resting membrane potential. The second, long-lasting phase is characterized by a large decrease in membrane conductance and a depolarization from the resting membrane potential. The reversal potential for the second phase is -94 +/- 1.2 mV, and a linear relationship between reversal potential and external K+ indicates that the A II-mediated response is predominantly inhibition of K+ permeability. The A II response can be elicited when external Ca2+ is replaced by Sr2+ or Ba2+, but the response is inhibited when Mn2+ is added to the bath or when stimulated in a Ca2+-free solution. A II appears to inhibit at least two conductances, when the cell is stimulated by long current steps. External application of A II inhibited the Ca2+ regenerative response found in glomerulosa cells in a dose-dependent manner. The rate of rise of the regenerative response was greatly attenuated by A II; half-maximal inhibition was produced by about 10(-9) M A II. In addition, rectification, evident at voltages more positive than -60 mV during current stimulation, was also inhibited. In conclusion, A II causes rat glomerulosa cells to depolarize due to the inhibition of resting K+ permeability. Action potential activity is not observed during A II-mediated membrane depolarization; rather, both Ca2+ and K+ conductances appear to be inhibited during A II application.\r"

The aim of this study was to measure in hypothyroid (Tx) rats the content of brain cortex rT3 during a constant 7-day infusion of either [125I]T4 alone, corresponding to 12 pmol T4/day X 100 g body weight (BW), or together with 400 pmol T4/day. [125I]T4, rT3, and T3 were extracted from brain cortex, pituitary, kidney, and liver with a combination of adsorption chromatography on Sephadex G-25, HPLC, and immunoprecipitation. [131I]T4, T3, or rT3 were used as internal standards. [125I]rT3 could be detected in brain cortex, liver, and kidney in Tx rats infused with [125I]T4 (12 pmol T4/day X 100 g BW) and in those infused with 400 pmol T4/day X 100 g BW. The highest rT3 concentrations were found in brain cortex, where it represented 6% to 10.5% of the local T4 concentration. During an infusion of 400 pmol T4/day X 100 g BW, brain cortex T3 concentration was 6 times higher in the brain cortex than in serum, and even exceeded that of T4. In Tx rats receiving [125I]T4 alone the brain cortex to serum T3 ratio was 3:1, but the total serum T3 concentration, measured by RIA, was much higher than that due to conversion [0.50 +/- (SE) 0.1 pmol/ml vs. 0.018 +/- 0.002 pmol T3/ml], indicating thyroidal secretion. The effect of the blood-brain barrier on rT3 was measured by infusing [125I]rT3 over 4 days. After killing, rT3 was isolated as above. Approximately 3% of serum rT3 was retrieved from the brain cortex, whereas during the T4 infusion 40-50% of serum rT3 was found demonstrating that brain cortex rT3 is locally produced.\r"

  ".W": "The object of this study was to determine whether the increase in LH pulse frequency and mean blood LH levels on day 22 of pregnancy in the rat is due to the precipitous fall in plasma progesterone (P) levels that occurs late in gestation. On day 20 of pregnancy two groups of animals with indwelling jugular cannulae were implanted sc with empty or P-containing Silastic capsules. Blood samples were withdrawn 0.5 h before and 5.5 h postimplantation on day 20 (0800 and 1400 h), at 1400 h on day 21, and at the end of the study between 1200-1300 h on day 22 to follow the time course of changes in plasma P levels over this 2-day period in both groups. These groups were bled on day 22 for 3 h between 0900-1200 h for analysis of pulsatile LH release. A third group not implanted with Silastic capsules was bled on day 20 for 3 h; plasma P levels in these rats bled on day 20 did not differ from the preimplantation values observed in either group of capsule-implanted rats. In empty capsule-implanted animals, plasma P values declined slightly from days 20 to 21 and were dramatically reduced between days 21 and 22. In contrast, after implantation of P capsules, plasma P levels were elevated on day 20 and remained elevated on day 21 compared with preimplantation values. Although these increased plasma P values declined between days 21 and 22, reflecting a decrease in endogenous P secretion, they were nonetheless comparable to day 20 values due to the presence of the P-containing capsules. Plasma estradiol values did not differ significantly between any of the experimental groups. In the empty capsule group bled on day 22, mean blood LH levels and LH pulse frequency were significantly higher compared to day 20 values, at a time when plasma P levels had fallen significantly from day 20 values. However, in the P capsule group, mean blood LH levels and LH pulse frequency on day 22 were significantly lower than values in the empty capsule group and were not different from the low values on day 20. Thus, preventing a decline in plasma P values to the low levels normally found on day 22 prevented the increase in LH pulse frequency and mean blood LH levels normally seen at this time of pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Estrogen receptor activation has been examined in murine uteri by characterizing binding to ATP-Sepharose. Determinations were performed under conditions in which specific binding to estrogen receptors was demonstrated by both agonist and antagonist without participation by nonreceptor antiestrogen-binding components. Cell-free activation of estrogen receptors in cytosol was more effectively promoted by [3H]estradiol estradiol than by [3H]4-hydroxytamoxifen or [3H]tamoxifen aziridine. However, when in situ activation was examined after intact uteri were exposed to [3H]estradiol or [3H]4-hydroxytamoxifen, virtually all extracted nuclear receptors demonstrated activated binding to ATP-Sepharose within 20 min of hormone exposure. Profiles of nuclear receptor activation were remarkably similar after exposure to either agonist or antagonist. Estrogen receptors in cytosol prepared after exposing intact uteri to 3H-labeled ligands were characterized by much less ability to bind to ATP-Sepharose than nuclear receptors. After uteri were exposed to [3H]estradiol, the activated receptor fraction in the cytosol progressively increased in contrast to preparations obtained after uteri were exposed to [3H]4-hydroxytamoxifen, which demonstrated a constant level of activation. Thus, even when activation has occurred within the intact uterus, agonists and antagonists may be characterized by different apparent levels of receptor activation in the cytosol fraction. These differences in the cytosol, however, are considerably overshadowed by the extensive activation occurring within the nuclear fraction, which we have observed to be similar with agonist and antagonist. Since estrogen receptors appear to act within chromatin, and cytosol receptors may be produced by receptor redistribution during preparation, we interpret these observations to indicate that in situ receptor activation is very similar after exposure to either agonist or antagonist. Consequently, antagonism does not appear to be associated with antiestrogens that impede receptor activation within intact murine uteri.\r"

However, the effect of ISO injected at night after light-induced reduction of pineal melatonin has not been reported. In this study, light exposure began at 6 1/4 h into one (normally 10-h) dark phase. The hamsters were injected with either ISO (1 mg/kg) or vehicle 15 min later when pineal melatonin content was low. Light exposure continued. Two h after ISO but not vehicle injection, pineal melatonin content rose more than six-fold. In other animals injected at the end of the usual light phase then kept in light for 2 h, pineal melatonin was equally low after ISO or vehicle injection. The Syrian hamster pineal gland can respond in vivo to a beta-adrenergic agonist injected at the physiologically relevant time of the normal nocturnal melatonin surge. This finding, taken together with the previously reported inhibition of the endogenous nocturnal melatonin surge with a beta-blocking drug, suggests that a beta-adrenergic mechanism controls the hamster pineal melatonin rhythm.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if the variations exhibited by pituitary OT and VP during the stages of the estrous cycle in the rat were also present in the spinal cord. The stage of the estrous cycle was determined by vaginal smears in female Long Evans rats. Following decapitation, the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral segments of the spinal cord were isolated and homogenized, and the hormones were extracted from the tissue with the Sep-pak method. OT and VP content were determined by RIA. A cyclic variation in spinal cord OT and VP was present, with maximal levels occurring in diestrus, a time in the estrous cycle when LH and estradiol levels are lowest. Our results suggest that spinal cord OT and VP may be regulated by ovarian hormones. These data represent the first documented changes in spinal cord levels of OT and VP under physiological conditions.\r"

Mean serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration declined during 0.4 (P less than 0.01) and 4.0 micrograms/kg X minute (P less than 0.05) infusion doses of DA. This effect of DA was not consistently (P greater than 0.05) antagonized by MTC. Six women received DA (4.0 micrograms/kg X minute) or glucose for 18 hours. After 17 hours, MTC was given. Blood samples were collected every 10 minutes during the last 8 hours. No significant effect on LH pulse frequency and pulse amplitude was observed (P greater than 0.05). A marked (P less than 0.01) rise in LH occurred after MTC administration. The authors conclude that (1) physiologic doses of DA may inhibit LH secretion with only little, if any, effect on the pulsatile release; and (2) low-affinity DA receptors responsive to DA D-2 antagonists may regulate LH secretion.\r"

Patterns of salivary readings in CC and spontaneous cycles were similar and showed a preovulatory peak 6.2 (mean) days before the luteinizing hormone peak. The trend in vaginal readings for CC cycles differed from that of spontaneous ovulations in that the values were depressed during and shortly after CC therapy. Occurrence of the periovulatory nadir and subsequent rise was common to both groups. The rise in vaginal readings CC cycles occurred within 24 hours of the luteinizing hormone peak in 88% of cases. Retrospective analysis showed that, based on this method, artificial insemination would have been timed appropriately in 25 of 27 cycles or in every cycle, depending on the protocol used.

Of the 11 births, 6 (54.5%) were breech presentations, and 9 (81.8%) were cesarean sections. In five cases the rudimentary horn was removed, with associated salpingooophorectomy in three patients. Cervical cerclage was not performed in any of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-one ectopic pregnancies were manually expressed (i.e., \"milked out\") by the tubal fimbria during a 13-year period. Reproductive histories and operative findings were unremarkable when compared with the general population with ectopic gestation. The subsequent reproductive performance was evaluated in 27 patients who attempted conception. Twenty-five (92%) of the 27 patients subsequently conceived, 23 (85%) had at least one successful term pregnancy, and the remaining 2 (7%) had abortions only. There was no repeat ectopic pregnancy. Average follow-up time was 38.5 months. Previous experience with this technique has been disappointing with low postoperative rates of successful term pregnancies. Favorable outcomes after fimbrial expression have been reported only in small numbers of patients. It is suggested that the procedure is appropriate for distal tubal gestations that are loosely adherent within the tubal lumen; these are usually expressed with minimal efforts. However, if the gestational mass does not yield to gentle milking of the tube or evacuation has been incomplete, the surgeon can always use a linear salpingotomy. More experience is obviously needed to verify these preliminary results, suggesting that fimbrial evacuation is simple, safe, and advantageous in properly selected cases.\r"

Nine pregnancies were reported for an uncorrected use-effectiveness rate of 0.33 per 100 woman-years. Cycle control was excellent, bleeding irregularities were minimal, and the incidence of side effects was very low. No clinically significant variations in blood pressure means or weight means were observed. Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism studies were limited to 6 months and showed minimal alterations. Subject compliance with the preparation was excellent. It is concluded that this triphasic oral contraceptive with its varying ratios of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is an effective, predictable, and well-tolerated combination oral contraceptive.\r"

Incubations were performed in the absence and presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and different concentrations of oxytocin ([OT], 0.1 to 1000 mIU/ml). After incubation, the tissue levels of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and the media concentrations of progesterone (P) were determined. Although hCG stimulated both cAMP and P formation in CL of all ages, OT alone had no effect on the basal production of these parameters. However, under certain experimental conditions, OT counteracted the stimulatory effect of hCG on both cAMP and P formation. Because the maximal antigonadotropic effect was found for concentrations of OT in the magnitude of the physiologic intraluteal concentration, these in vitro data suggest a role for OT in the luteolytic process of humans.\r"

Patients with severe pelvic adhesions due to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometriosis were classed as having a frozen pelvis if less than or equal to 20% of total ovarian surface was visible and if the rest of the ovary was bound down with significant adhesions. IVF offers the only hope of pregnancy for these patients. Fifty-one treatment cycles in 23 such patients were matched against 51 cycles in 48 patients with adhesion-free ovaries. The study group had a significantly higher number of cancelled oocyte retrievals because of poor estradiol (E2) response. They also had a significantly lower rate of E2 rise and a lower peak value of E2 before and after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin. These patients took longer to respond to a hyperstimulation regime, and when a response occurred they formed fewer follicles, as measured with the use of ultrasound. Lower numbers of oocytes were obtained from this group, but the fertilization rate of oocytes was the same for both groups. One pregnancy occurred in the study group and 11 in the control group. It is possible that disruption of ovarian blood supply or mechanical factors due to the pressure of significant adhesions prevent a good follicular response in patients with a frozen pelvis.\r"

This difference was observed also when the routine semen characteristics of density, motility, and morphologic features were considered separately regarding their relationship with the SPA. Motility after preincubation showed the most significant positive correlation with the SPA result. Therefore, the SPA score should be limited to semen samples showing adequate postincubation motility.\r"

There were no significant differences in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) receptors, and testosterone (T) concentrations among the testes. The other experiment was performed with the use of testicular organ culture. Specific binding sites for FSH, hCG, and T production were similar in cultured testes maintained at 33 degrees and 37 degrees C for 7 days.

The combination of smoking and testicular varicoceles is strongly related to the incidence of oligospermia, defined as sperm count less than or equal to 20 X 10(6)/ml, in each sample. Smokers with testicular varicoceles, in each sample, had a disproportionately high incidence of oligospermia. In the combined sample of 254 men, the smokers with testicular varicoceles had an incidence of oligospermia approximately ten times greater than that in nonsmokers with testicular varicoceles and approximately five times greater than that in men who smoked but were without testicular varicoceles. This relationship of cigarette smoking and testicular varicoceles to oligospermia has not been previously reported. The pathophysiologic basis of the interaction between smoking and varicoceles was theorized to be due to an increased secretion of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, induced by cigarette smoking. The elevated catecholamine concentrations in the renal vein would then reach the testes via retrograde flow down the internal spermatic vein in men with testicular varicoceles, resulting in seminiferous tubule damage.\r"

Prior analysis (1976-1981) had indicated, however, that variation existed in evaluating similar students, depending on the clerkship training site, i.e., three sites graded students in a significantly different fashion than the three other sites. Utilizing these data to focus on the evaluation process, a comprehensive and specific six-point plan was developed to improve consistency in evaluations at the different training sites. This plan consisted of a yearly meeting of affiliate faculty, assigning predoctoral training administrative responsibility to one faculty member at each training site, increased telephone communication, affiliate-faculty attendance at the university site evaluation session, faculty rotation to spend time at other training sites, and financial reimbursement to the affiliate training sites. After intervention, analysis (1981-1983) indicated that five of the six clerkship sites now grade students in a consistent fashion, with only one affiliate using different grading standards. The intervention was therefore judged to be successful for five of the six training sites, allowing for better communication and more critical and consistent evaluation of medical students.\r"

Multiple strategies are proposed for accomplishing these goals. The paper concludes with the recommendation that a successful curriculum needs to be promoted by at least one enthusiastic faculty member.

Factor analysis showed that the interests of potential patients centered primarily in the areas of interpersonal relations, continuity of care, access to services, and activities such as preventive care, all of which are highly valued by family medicine.\r"

Women did better than men and some occupational or educational subcategories were above this average, but no subgroup had a high enough response rate to warrant relying on the instructions for important information. In particular, there was no evidence that either those in poorer health or those completing a questionnaire for their young children were any more careful in reading the instructions. Those who design such self-administered questionnaires are advised to make the form completion self-evident, rather than to rely upon introductory instructions to convey this information.\r"

  ".W": "As family physicians increasingly begin to practice in a variety of settings both in the U.S. and abroad, they are faced with the challenge of caring for patients from different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. In particular it has been suggested that delivering effective and acceptable community oriented primary care requires a deeper understanding of the cultural background of patients, their families, and the social contexts in which they live. In this paper, the authors provide an introduction to the field of medical anthropology--the discipline which studies the cultural dimensions of health, illness, and the medical care system. The \"anthropology of family medicine\" (the theoretical focus) is distinguished from the \"anthropology of family practice\" (the applied focus), and contributions from medical anthropological research at the micro (practitioner-patient relationship), intermediate (family), and macro (community) levels of analysis are examined. In particular, three clinical case vignettes are presented which illustrate the ways in which cultural issues can become critical in the care of patients and their families. Finally, the activities of the STFM Task Force on Skills and Curriculum Development in Cross-Cultural Experiences are described, and future directions for research and teaching efforts are proposed.\r"

The therapy model, Bowen Family Systems Theory, asserts that personal changes are best made by altering emotion-based behavior patterns derived from prior generations of the family. Beginning to deal with personal family issues has helped the author teach residents and medical students more effectively and work better with patients and their families.\r"

However, compliance studies have not identified the physician's sometimes unwitting complicity in the noncompliance. Some physician-patient partnerships are marked by an intensifying power struggle which may have more to do with the emotional needs of each party than with the specific content around which the struggle is focused. This article discusses how these power struggles can be activated and what the physician can do to defuse the struggle and work effectively with noncompliant patients.\r"

A model is proposed that enables each profession to work cooperatively with the other by recognizing the particular dysfunction present within the family. This model is explained and clarified in terms of the interaction of biomedical and developmental crises in the course of the normal family life cycle. The purpose of this model is to provide a framework through which the two professions of family medicine and family therapy can cooperate to treat the various kinds of levels of dysfunction that occur within families.\r"

Colleagues at several residency programs agreed to help us to find out if these choices can be quantified and whether personal characteristics of respondents or the acuteness or chronicity of the patient's illness influence these priorities. Two sets of 15 forced-choice item pairs, one set in reference to chronic illness and one set in reference to acute illness, were used in the study. Responses from 346 family physicians and non-physician colleagues ranked six hypothetical elements of patient care for acute and chronic illness: continuity, comprehensiveness, family orientation, community orientation, coordination and prevention. The data were analyzed using the psychometric scaling technique of paired comparisons. The analysis yielded a set of rankings which showed that these choices were quantifiable and made with a high degree of individual consistency and greater intragroup agreement than would result from chance. Patterns of choice differed for acute and chronic illness in a manner consistent with observed clinical practice.\r"

Control group patients were seen only once. At that time, the questionnaire was given without the preceding presentation. The interviewer then discussed incorrect answers with control group patients and distributed the booklet. Both groups were asked to evaluate the booklet by mail approximately one month after administration of the health knowledge questionnaire. The experimental group showed a statistically significant higher mean score on the health knowledge questionnaire. The experimental group answered 96.8% correctly, compared to 71.6% for the control group. In their responses to the mailed evaluation forms, both experimental and control groups thought the booklet was well written and useful in understanding and treating the illnesses described.\r"

The present report studied 25 independent predictors of no-show behavior using both univariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 579 kept appointments and 84 failed appointments were analyzed. Results of univariate analysis indicated the following significant relationships with appointment behavior: age, ethnicity, marital status, mode of payment, chronic illness, telephone in house, type of care, prior visits to center, cost of care, transportation to center, physician ethnicity, and linguistic capability. However, multiple logistic function analysis revealed only six significant associations: type of care, chronic illness, linguistic capability, mode of payment, physician-patient sex differences, and marital status of the patient. Multivariate analysis may yield a more accurate and clinically useful model of no-show behavior. For example, language barrier may be more of a problem than the race of the patient. Prospective studies might benefit from these considerations.\r"

The purposes of primary care practice, research, and education would be well served by techniques that improve the physician's knowledge of the patient population. Epidemiology offers the fundamental principles and methods to support primary care, but these have been neither appropriately modified nor integrated into primary care practice.
