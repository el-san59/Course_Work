  ".W": "Twenty patients with extravasation of anthracyclines were treated on a single-arm pilot study with topical 99% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and observed for 3 months with regular examinations and photographs. DMSO was applied to approximately twice the area affected by the extravasation and allowed to air dry. This was repeated every six hours for 14 days. The initial signs of extravasation included swelling in 17 patients, erythema in 15, and pain in 12. The median area of damage was 8.25 cm2 and a median of 25 minutes elapsed between extravasation and application of DMSO with one patient not treated until seven days postextravasation. Sixteen patients were observed for 3 months, two died of disease earlier after receiving 2 weeks of DMSO and three days of DMSO, respectively, and two were lost to follow-up having received one day and five days of DMSO. In no patient did extravasation progress to ulceration or require surgical intervention, suggesting with 95% confidence a true ulceration rate of between 1% and 17%. At 3 months there was no sign of residual damage in six patients, while a pigmented indurated area remained in ten. Two patients had a recall reaction with increased pain at the extravasation site when further intravenous (IV) doxorubicin was administered. The only toxicities of DMSO included a burning feeling on application subsequently associated with itch, erythema, and mild scaling. Blisters occurred in four patients. Six patients reported a characteristic breath odor associated with DMSO. Topical DMSO appears to be a safe and effective treatment for anthracycline extravasation.\r"

Level of compliance was monitored (biochemically and with self-report) on a monthly basis for oral self administration of allopurinol and prednisone. Appointment-keeping to receive infused chemotherapy was also monitored. Nausea was the most frequent side effect experienced. Nausea, fever, and pain were the most difficult physical effects to tolerate when they occurred. Complex treatment regimens and severe diseases related to reports of more physical effects. Younger patients had a more difficult time dealing with these effects than did older patients. Neither the occurrence, frequency, or difficulty dealing with any of the effects related to noncompliance with either of the two self-administered medications. Difficulty with particular effects did relate to noncompliance with clinic appointments to receive infused chemotherapy.\r"

Published research in this area, however, is marked by contradictory results. Positive relationships between a variety of psychosocial factors and length of survival from cancer are reported, but other studies uncover no such associations. In a previously reported prospective investigation of 359 patients with newly diagnosed malignant diseases, we found no relationship between clinical outcome and any psychosocial factor studied. We have continued to observe these patients, who are now up to 8 years post-diagnosis, and report here additional data on their disease outcomes as they relate to psychosocial factors assessed at diagnosis. Two groups of patients were studied: 204 patients with advanced, prognostically poor malignant disease at diagnosis; and 155 patients with intermediate or high-risk melanoma or breast cancer. Shortly after diagnosis, patients completed a self-report questionnaire that assessed seven psychosocial factors previously reported to predict longevity in the general population. Factors included social ties and marital history, job satisfaction, use of psychotropic drugs, general life satisfaction, subjective view of adult health, hopelessness, and perception of amount of adjustment required to cope with the new diagnosis. Clinical factors--performance status and extent of disease at diagnosis--predicted clinical outcome. No psychosocial factor consistently was associated with length of survival or remission. Results of additional exploratory analyses also are reported.\r"

The automated intervention was designed as a cost-efficient strategy for assessing patients' needs on a periodic basis so that emerging needs could be identified in a timely way. Ninety-seven chemotherapy outpatients were surveyed at least once over the telephone by a computer in a high-quality, digitally stored voice asking 12 questions regarding the patients' \"concrete\" needs. Early results of this larger ongoing study, in which patients are scheduled to be called every 4 to 6 weeks for approximately four months, indicated that computer-automated surveys had broad-based acceptance among our outpatients and that patients were able to comply accurately with the survey's instructions. Furthermore, the speech recognition system was found to be reliable, and patients' response patterns to the automated surveys valid. Nonparticipation in this study (28.0%) was not substantially higher than in our previous research within this patient population and neither nonparticipation nor attrition appeared significantly attributable to the automation itself. This method offers the potential for cost-efficient, universal, and ongoing assessment of patient needs, facilitating timely intervention, and efficient use of professional staff.\r"

  ".W": "Clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas have been thought to synthesize some pituitary hormones as shown by studies involving cell culture, immunocytochemistry, or measurement of hormone levels in tumor homogenates. Nevertheless, they are not associated with hypersecretion of pituitary hormones. To further clarify hormone synthesis in such pituitary adenomas, the presence of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of prolactin (PRL) growth hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the cytoplasm of 16 nonfunctioning adenomas was determined by means of a hybridization technique, and compared to the immunocytochemical findings. In three adenomas (19%) PRL mRNA was detected and in one case (6%) ACTH mRNA was detected. The hybridization technique appears to be more sensitive than immunohistochemistry for detection of specific mRNA's in assigning the hormone synthesis potential to clinically nonfunctioning tumors. The results suggest that PRL and ACTH are synthesized in some cases of clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas and that hybridization techniques are useful to investigate hormone synthesis in pituitary adenomas. The ability to demonstrate PRL mRNA in tumor tissues allowed differentiation between hyperprolactinemia caused by synthesis of PRL in the tumor and that due to hypersecretion from the adjacent normal pituitary.\r"

  ".U": "89036366\r", 
  ".W": "Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP's) and blink reflexes (BR's) were recorded from 40 patients with clinical and radiological evidence of posterior fossa tumors. They were examined in three groups according to the anatomical location of the lesion: Group A included 15 patients with midline tumors; Group B included 14 patients with cerebellar hemispheric tumors; and Group C included 11 patients with cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors. More of the 40 patients had BAEP abnormalities (32) than BR abnormalities (24). All of the 11 patients with CPA tumors had some kind of BAEP and BR abnormalities. The 14 patients with cerebellar tumors showed the next most frequent abnormalities: 12 related to the BAEP's and seven to the BR's. The 15 patients with midline tumors showed the least number of abnormalities: nine related to BAEP's and six to the BR's. In the analysis of BAEP wave latencies and interpeak latencies, a wave III latency delay occurred in all groups; latencies of waves IV and V were more significantly delayed in patients with CPA and cerebellar hemispheric tumors, and the interpeak latencies of waves III-V and I-V were markedly prolonged only in patients with CPA tumors (p less than 0.01). In all tumor groups, early response (R1) of BR's was significantly delayed in comparison to a healthy volunteer control group (p less than 0.01), but R1 was more pronounced in cases of CPA tumors when compared with the other tumor groups. Although significant delays in direct and consensual late reflex components (R2) of BR's were noted in comparison to the control group, this delay could not differentiate one tumor group from another. In can be concluded that, while these tests reflect the functions of different cranial nerves and brain-stem tracts, BAEP monitoring is more sensitive than BR testing for the detection of brain-stem involvement in posterior fossa tumors. Cerebellopontine angle tumors almost always cause severe abnormalities in both tests. Cerebellar hemispheric tumors and midline tumors cause fewer changes in both BAEP's and BR's.\r"

  ".W": "The differentiation of bacterial from aseptic meningitis in postoperative neurosurgical patients has traditionally been based on the clinical setting, a recent history of steroid administration, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, including the total and differential leukocyte counts, Gram stain, glucose, and total protein. Recent reports questioning both the validity of a relative CSF lymphocytosis in excluding bacterial meningitis and the usefulness of standard CSF testing prompted the authors to reevaluate these standard criteria. The type of operation, the presence of a foreign body, use of steroids, postoperative day on which symptoms developed, altered mental status, neck stiffness, headache, and nausea were not helpful in the differential diagnosis. High fever, new neurological deficits, an active CSF leak, and elevated leukocyte counts in the CSF and peripheral blood favored a bacterial etiology. The CSF glucose level and the differential leukocyte count were less helpful. No criterion or combination of criteria was sensitive and specific enough to reliably differentiate aseptic from bacterial meningitis in the majority of patients. The possibility of improving diagnostic accuracy with newer tests, such as CSF lactate, ferritin, total amino acids, C-reactive protein, and amyloid-A, should be assessed.\r"

  ".W": "In a retrospective study of magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in 289 neurosurgical patients, loss of signal intensity (signal-void phenomenon, SVP) of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the mesencephalic aqueduct was observed in 77 patients. This SVP was noted in the MR studies of 12 of 14 patients with communicating hydrocephalus who showed a normal mean intracranial pressure (ICP) and normal pulse pressure, but in only seven of 50 patients with high mean ICP and high pulse pressure (such as those with a supratentorial tumor). The difference in the incidence of SVP between these two disease groups was statistically significant by Fisher's direct probability test. Based on MR images triggered by electrocardiography (EKG) waves, graphs were plotted to show the signal intensity of ventricular CSF versus time after the EKG R-wave. These graphs showed six distinct patterns which changed after the ICP was lowered by the withdrawal of CSF via a lumbar puncture. It is known that CSF in the cranial cavity flows toward the spinal space in a to-and-fro manner in response to the pulsations of the brain. The SVP reflects the capacity of the craniospinal cavity to buffer pressure changes within it. It may be possible to differentiate normal from increased ICP by the MR signal intensity of the CSF in the ventricular system.\r"

After being treated with the glutaraldehyde solution, the biomembrane lost its antigenicity while its collagen underwent an irreversible cross-linking reaction, causing it to become a stable nonviable polymer resistant to absorption by the host. The biomembrane was used experimentally in 43 procedures on 20 dogs and was applied clinically in 614 patients. The results demonstrated that it is an acceptable material for the repair of dural defects, with the following advantages: 1) it is nontoxic to the body and brain tissues, with minimal tissue reaction; 2) its biophysical properties facilitate watertight closure with sutures; 3) its distensibility makes it suitable for decompressive surgical dural repair; and 4) its visceral surface is extremely smooth, causing virtually no adhesions with the brain tissue while the outer surface readily heals with the subcutaneous tissue.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of vasoconstrictors of intracranial arteries on the amplitude and configuration of the intracranial pulse wave (ICPW) was investigated. Continuous pressure recordings from the descending aorta (systemic arterial pressure) and the third cerebral ventricle (intracranial pressure) were obtained from anesthetized cats. Computerized analysis of the configuration, amplitude, and frequency spectrum of ventricular wave (ICPW) and aortic pulse wave (SAPW) was performed. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was injected intracisternally. In 24 control cats, 2 ml artificial CSF was injected into the cisterna magna. This produced a significant increase in amplitude of the ICPW but no change in the SAPW. Ten animals received 14 intracisternal injections of 2 ml autologous blood which caused narrowing of the amplitude of the ICPW as well as of all its components (P1, P2, and P3), with no significant change in the SAPW's. Eight animals were also subjected to cisternal injection of 2 ml of a 10(-4)-M solution of 5-HT, resulting in findings similar to those produced by autologous blood. Frequency spectrum of the intracranial and aortic pulse waves showed a high degree of correlation between wave amplitudes and height of the fundamental wave in the FFT record. These results suggest that the cerebral vasospasm that follows cisternal injections of blood and 5-HT in cats can be diagnosed by analysis of the ICPW. This method may allow early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of cerebral vasospasm in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Lactate dynamics in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and serum were studied in 20 chloralose-anesthetized cats following fluid-percussion trauma. Brain lactate and brain tissue pH were measured by hydrogen-1 and phophorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The CSF, arterial, and cerebrovenous serum lactate levels as well as serum glucose concentration were quantified. In the six sham-operated control animals, brain, CSF, cerebrovenous, and arterial lactate levels as well as brain pH remained at normal values. In the five animals in the mild-trauma group (1.6 atm), brain and CSF lactate levels were moderately elevated, although the brain pH and serum lactate content remained at control values. Severe trauma (3.1 atm) in nine cats produced an 82% increase in the brain lactate index and a reduction in brain tissue pH (7.02 +/- 0.02 to 6.95 +/- 0.02; mean +/- standard error of the mean), indicating brain tissue acidosis caused by excessive lactate accumulation. Brain lactate levels reached a peak 1 1/2 hours after severe trauma, then steadily decreased to normal levels by 8 hours posttrauma. Maximum increases of CSF and arterial lactate levels (from 1.4 +/- 0.2 to 4.1 +/- 0.4 and from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 4.1 to 0.6 mmol/liter, respectively) were observed 15 minutes after trauma, and the values decreased during the next 2 hours. The response was biphasic, with a secondary rise observed in both CSF and serum lactate levels during the remaining 4 hours of the experiment. The difference between the arterial and venous lactate levels (A-Vlact) gradually increased and reached a peak 2 hours postinjury (from -0.05 +/- 0.10 to -0.41 +/- 0.09 mmol/liter). The results of this study show that the production of lactate in brain tissue, CSF, and blood increased in proportion to the severity of the injury. The observation that lactate levels in blood and CSF are maximum immediately following impact while brain lactate and A-Vlact are gradually increasing suggests that the brain-tissue production of lactate fails to account for the rapid appearance of lactate in CSF and blood. It is speculated that the initial elevation of CSF lactate values reflects the systemic response of trauma, and the secondary rise of CSF lactate levels following severe trauma is due to slow seepage of lactate produced by brain tissue into the CSF space. These studies are the first to describe the temporal profile of brain lactate production and eventual clearance by CSF and blood in fluid-percussion injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In this report, the suicide axoplasmic transport of adriamycin is described as a novel approach to sensory ganglionectomy. When injected into a branch of the trigeminal nerve in the cat, adriamycin was swiftly transported by way of retrograde axoplasmic flow to the sensory neurons parental to the injected nerve, where adriamycin-specific autofluorescence was observed. Trigeminal sensory evoked potentials became unobtainable 24 to 48 hours after injection of adriamycin in concentrations of 1% to 10%. The sensory neurons underwent subacute degeneration within a week due to the delayed action of adriamycin, and consequently the primary afferents degenerated in a restricted projection field of the brain-stem trigeminal sensory nuclei. These results indicate that retrograde axoplasmic transport of adriamycin is a unique approach to noninvasive sensory ganglionectomy with strict, albeit simple, safe targeting of sensory neurons and little likelihood of regeneration.\r"

A relationship to damage of the cerebral vasculature by immune complexes is suggested as one possible explanation for this unusual occurrence.

Post-diuretic renal washout was also measured, to evaluate the use of this procedure after bone scintigraphy. Stasis occurring only in the supine position was excluded by obtaining upright images. The findings on bone scintigraphy were compared with the results of renal sonography. Patients showing persistent pelvicaliceal concentration in the upright position after bone scintigraphy were found to have evidence of obstructive uropathy by sonography or other studies. Furosemide administration was followed by washout of the bone tracer from all kidneys with proven partial ureteral obstruction. Persistent renal pelvicaliceal concentration, in upright images after bone scintigraphy, appears to be a reliable indicator of obstructive uropathy. However, measurement of post-diuretic renal washout, after bone scintigraphy, does not reliably detect obstructive uropathy, and may be misleading if interpreted in the same way as the standard diuretic renogram.\r"

The ejection fraction (EF) was lower in Group A than Group I (41.9 +/- 2.5 vs. 57.1 +/- 2.0%, p less than 0.001), as was peak diastolic filling rate normalized to end diastolic volume (PDFR-EDV/sec) (1.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.1 EDV/sec, p less than 0.05). PDFR normalized to stroke volume was similar in both groups. An excellent linear correlation was found between EF and PDFR-EDV/sec in the total study population. Isovolumic relaxation period (IRP) was beyond our upper normal value of 94 msec in 64% of patients and it was shorter in Group A than I (95.8 +/- 12.7 vs. 147.0 +/- 13.6 msec, p less than 0.05). The presence of shorter IRP in Group A than in I is probably a result of an earlier mitral valve opening as a consequence of higher left atrial pressure.\r"

Overall uptake of 131I in lungs was less than 1% of the administered dose in 11 patients. All patients were treated with radioiodine. No lung uptake was found in 20 patients at the last 100 mCi post-therapy scan. Among them, Tg level became undetectable during T4 treatment in eight, lung CT scan showed the disappearance of the micronodules in seven, and lung biopsy did not show evidence of disease in two patients. No patient developed radiation lung fibrosis. In conclusion, favorable responses to radioiodine treatment were observed despite relatively low overall uptake, in relation to the small size of lung metastases. This provides high concentrations of radioiodine and therefore high radiation doses.\r"

Imaging and biodistribution of this radioimmunocomplex were evaluated. MoAb P3 was similarly labeled as a negative control. Of 24 athymic mice bearing s.c. human fibrosarcoma, 12 received 10 microCi of [111In]MoAb 19-24 and 12 received 10 microCi of [111In]MoAb P3. The mice were imaged at 24, 48, 68, or 168 hr, after i.p. injection. Region of interest and biodistribution analysis showed maximum localization of MoAb 19-24 in the tumor at 72 hr with maximum liver localization of 24 hr. Analysis of MoAb P3 showed maximum tumor and liver activity at 24 hr. Tumor specificity studies were also conducted in three nude mice bearing a sarcoma in the left flank and a Burkitt's lymphoma in the right flank. Selective uptake was seen in the sarcoma but not in the lymphoma. The excellent uptake of [111In]SCN-Bz-DTPA-MoAb 19-24 in sarcoma without appreciable liver activity indicates that it may be a useful tumor imaging agent in man.\r"

Therefore, we assessed the accumulation of 111In-labeled leukocytes in tissue samples characterized as either ischemic but viable or necrotic by metabolic, histochemical, and ultrastructural criteria. Six open-chest dogs received left anterior descending coronary occlusion for 2 hr followed by 4 hr reperfusion. Myocardial blood flow was determined by microspheres and autologous 111In-labeled leukocytes were injected intravenously. Fluorine-18-2-deoxyglucose, a tracer of exogenous glucose utilization, was injected 3 hr after reperfusion. The dogs were killed 4 hr after reperfusion. The risk and the necrotic regions were assessed following in vivo dye injection and postmortem tetrazolium staining. Myocardial samples were obtained in the ischemic but viable, necrotic and normal zones, and counted for 111In and 18F activity. Compared to normal, leukocytes were entrapped in necrotic regions (111In activity: 207 +/- 73%) where glucose uptake was decreased (26 +/- 15%). A persistent glucose uptake, marker of viability, was mainly seen in risk region (135 +/- 85%) where leukocytes accumulation was moderate in comparison to normal zone (146 +/- 44%). Thus, the glucose uptake observed in viable tissue is mainly related to myocytes metabolism and not to leukocytes metabolism.\r"

These phantoms all provide a qualitative index of system resolution with the inherent assumption that any change in intrinsic resolution would be apparent in the bar/hole pattern image. However on nine gamma cameras, comparison of intrinsic resolution determined from the line spread function by NEMA standards and from visual estimation of a four-quadrant bar phantom image showed poor correlation. The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a new test pattern which would provide a more accurate estimate of resolution. We developed a line resolution phantom (LRP) which consisted of a 16-cm-diameter lead disk with a series of horizontal and vertical slits. This phantom permits a quantitative estimate of intrinsic resolution (to within 0.5 mm) from a visual examination of the LRP image. Evaluation on nine gamma cameras showed good agreement between results obtained with the LRP and measurement of resolution from the line spread function. The LRP is a simple and inexpensive test phantom which should find applications in quality control and acceptance testing.\r"

Clarity of purpose and desired outcomes; the provision of sufficient time to educate and ensure cooperation; refocusing and reanalysis; support for staff in leadership positions; and high visibility throughout the organization on the part of top level management are mandatory in bringing about a radical change such as our organization has experienced. The Alta Bates-Herrick Hospital has a rich tradition of high quality care in Berkeley and, indeed, throughout Northern California. The founders of both campuses, Alta Bates, RN, and Leroy Herrick, MD, established a heritage of concern, compassion, and caring. Streamlining the structure of the hospital to ensure fiscal viability, efficiency, and the ability to respond quickly to challenges coupled with the ongoing internal efforts to articulate and retain high quality care will continue to serve the people of our community well.\r"

Hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity, plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were assayed on gestation d 20 and postnatal d 8, 14, 22 and 30. Cholestyramine had no effect on maternal or fetal plasma lipid levels but increased fetal hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity by approximately 50%. The increased reductase activity persisted on postnatal d 8 and 14. Control pups suckled by dams fed cholestyramine also had significantly increased HMG-CoA reductase activities on postnatal d 8 and 14. The high fat and cholesterol diet significantly increased maternal plasma cholesterol but had no effect on HMG-CoA reductase activity in the fetus or suckling pups. Neither cholestyramine nor high fat and cholesterol altered the rat milk cholesterol levels. The studies demonstrate that HMG-CoA reductase activity in the developing rat can be altered by factors dependent on maternal diet. They do not support a hypothesis for regulation by maternal dietary or milk cholesterol supply.\r"

Neither of the simple correlations, however, account for CHD in many countries. We examined dietary and alcohol consumption data from 18 countries. The simple correlations with CHD are as follows: saturated fat, r = 0.71; polyunsaturated fat, r = -0.34; total alcohol consumption, r = -0.58. A multiple-regression equation incorporating the dietary and alcohol data, however, yields an r of 0.92.\r"

Lipoproteins were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation and defined by chemical composition. Protein moieties were defined by their changes. The lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in epididymal adipose tissue, heart and diaphragm was measured. Early feeding patterns induced permanent body weight differences in adult mice. Serum phospholipid content was significantly higher in obese than in control mice. Overfeeding led to significantly higher activity of LPL in adipose tissue; inversely, undernutrition induced a lower LPL activity. There was a trend toward variations of lipoprotein concentrations in relation to litter size, with significant differences being observed only between obese and undernourished mice for LDL-HDL1 (low density lipoprotein--high density lipoprotein) and HDL2 concentrations. Compared with normally fed mice the most notable alterations in plasma lipoprotein composition were, in LDL-HDL1, greater cholesteryl ester in obese and less phospholipid in undernourished mice. In contrast, tetramethylurea-soluble apolipoprotein distribution was unaffected by litter size. Although moderate differences were observed in lipoprotein compositions and levels in over- or undernourished mice, further investigations of lipoprotein metabolism and metabolic abnormalities in this animal model are required.\r"

One diet contained about 25 g neutral detergent fiber (NDF) in fruits and vegetables and included 100 g spinach, which is high in oxalic acid, every other day. The second diet was a low fiber diet that contained about 5 g NDF and the same amount of spinach as the first diet. On the basis of mean values for 6 wk, balances for calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc or manganese were not significantly different due to diet. Copper balances were significantly lower when the low fiber diet was consumed than when the diet containing fiber in fruits and vegetables and consequently a higher level of copper was consumed. Mineral balances were significantly different due to week. When results of both diets were considered together, mean mineral balances decreased at some time after wk 1 and returned to the wk 1 level during wk 6. Balances for wk 1 and 6 were not significantly different for any of the six minerals. These results demonstrate the importance of determining weekly balances for several weeks when conducting a human metabolic study.\r"

In the first experiment there were two dietary Ca concentrations (0.25 and 0.50%, wt/wt) at two different Ca:P ratios (0.6 and 1.3). In the second experiment the diets were formulated to contain 0.40% P and either 0.13, 0.25, 0.50 or 0.75% Ca. The diets contained 0.03% magnesium (Mg). The fecal outputs of Ca, P and Mg were lower (P less than 0.01) after feeding low Ca diets than after feeding high Ca diets. Urinary excretion of P decreased with increasing dietary Ca and increased with increasing P intake. In rats fed the 0.25% Ca diets whole-body retentions of Ca and P were lower than in the rats fed 0.50% Ca. Both increases in dietary Ca from 0.13 to 0.50% and P from 0.20 to 0.40% elevated Ca and P content of kidneys as well as the degree of nephrocalcinosis. However, after feeding the highest Ca concentration (0.75%) nephrocalcinosis was essentially absent while kidney concentrations of Ca and P were relatively low. When compared with 0.50% Ca in the diet, 0.75% Ca increased group mean whole-body retention of Ca but lowered that of P. In individual rats the degree of nephrocalcinosis and the concentrations of minerals in kidney were positively correlated.\r"

The present study examined the mechanisms underlying the effects of calcium supplementation by investigating the influence of dietary calcium on bone dynamics in young and aged rats. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was utilized with 0.2% (low) or 1.0% (high) calcium, 2- or 24-m-old female Long-Evans rats that were implanted subcutaneously with demineralized (DB) and mineralized (MB) bone powder. The four groups of rats were fed each of the respective diets for 11 wk and then implanted with one #5 gelatin capsule containing 30 mg of DB and another containing 100 mg of MB powder. The animals were injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 microCi/g body weight with 45Ca 14 h before the end of experiment. The ectopic bone as well as the right femurs were harvested 14 d after the rats were implanted. Marker enzyme activities (alkaline-formation and acid-resorption phosphatase), 45Ca uptake and calcium content were measured in the implants and the distal epiphyses of the right femurs. Bone turnover was higher in the young rats than in the old animals, and high dietary calcium in the young animals increased bone formation, as indicated by alkaline phosphatase activity. Dietary calcium level did not affect ectopic bone formation or resorption in the aged rats. The results indicate that high dietary intake of calcium does not affect bone dynamics in aged female rats but does increase bone formation in young rats.\r"

Body weight and ultrasonically estimated backfat depth were recorded at wk 0 (mating), 4, 8, 12 and 16 of pregnancy, and at d 2-3, 21 and 28 of lactation. Number of pigs born, survival rate to 28 d of age and piglet body weight at 0, 14, 21 and 28 d of age were recorded. Four male and four female progeny from each diet group of each genetic strain were slaughtered at 6 mo of age for carcass and organ weight measurements. OR and LR gilts responded similarly to feed restriction in body weight change, backfat depth and plasma traits. Body weight increased throughout gestation in OC and LC gilts but decreased about 6 kg in OR and LR gilts. Backfat remained relatively constant throughout gestation in OC and LC gilts but declined steadily in LR and OR gilts. There were no genetic group x diet interactions for any trait measured. Litter size and piglet survival were not affected by diet or genetic group, but piglet birth weight and daily gain to d 28 and to wk 25 were lower in both R groups. Backfat accretion and other indices of carcass fatness were reduced in progeny of R dams.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twelve 5- and 7-wk-old male chickens of each line were exposed at two different ambient temperatures, 10 and 25 degrees C. Two birds from the same line were placed in each calorimeter chamber for a 6-d period (2 d fasting and 4 d feeding). Similar food intakes and metabolizabilities of diet corrected for nitrogen balance revealed that FL and LL chickens ingested the same amount of metabolizable energy (ME). Moreover diet-induced thermogenesis did not appear to be defective in FL birds, and the maintenance ME requirement was similar in both lines. However, the partition of retained energy between fat and protein did differ with increased protein deposition and conversely, decreased fat retention in LL chickens, irrespective of age or ambient temperature. FL birds catabolized a greater proportion of dietary amino acids as confirmed by the increase in uric acid excretion. Finally, energy expenditure was significantly and similarly enhanced in both genotypes by cold exposure.\r"

E) modulates NK activity of young and old mice. Mice were fed either a corn oil (CO) or a fish oil (FO) diet supplemented with 30 or 500 mg/kg diet of vit. E for 6 wk. To study the effect of vit. E during active immune response and oxidative stress, groups of old mice fed CO and either 30 or 500 mg/kg diet of vit. E were injected with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) prior to assessment of their NK activity. As reported by others regarding mice fed a nonpurified diet, the old mice in all dietary groups had significantly less NK activity and tended to synthesize more PGE2 than young mice. FO-fed mice synthesized less PGE2 than CO-fed mice; however, their NK activity was not higher than that of CO-fed mice. By contrast young mice fed FO had a moderately lower NK activity than those fed CO. Vit. E supplementation did not change NK activity in nonimmunized mice but was effective in preventing SRBC-induced decrease in NK activity of old mice.\r"

Until recently, MRI had been unable to provide diagnostic dynamic images of the TMJ during opening. A series of 30 TMJ MRI examinations of 17 symptomatic patients and two normal volunteers (15 to 43 years old; 14 men and five women) was performed. Fast low angle shot (FLASH) sequences were used to provide a series of dynamic images of the TMJ in various phases of opening. In 30% of the joint examined, FLASH sequences contributed clinically significant information not available with standard T1-weighted sequences. These results suggest that FLASH images are particularly useful in distinguishing normal disc variants from pathologic conditions in which the disc is displaced anteriorly to a mild extent. The short imaging time of FLASH sequences decreases motion artifact in patients who have difficulty remaining still during the examination.\r"

Using a video image of a patient, esthetic and functional decisions can be made by the surgeon, orthodontist, and patient in a consensus manner. Distortion characteristics of video hardware, software, and the video camera are established, and adoption of imaging techniques is employed to maximize accuracy of the imaging process. Patients' attitudes toward video imaging concerning expectations, value of visual prediction, and degree of realism are also discussed. This study is intended to establish some of the basic goals of video imaging with general information in regard to hardware and software requirements.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes the healing of cutaneous wounds in experimental animals grafted with collagen-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) matrix/Silastic (Dow Corning Corp., Midland, MI) bilayers; assesses the feasibility of using collagen-GAG matrix as a vehicle for delivering culture-selected, autogenous fibroblasts to cutaneous wound sites; and evaluates the use of collagen-GAG/Silastic bilayers as mucosal substitutes. Cutaneous and mucosal wounds in New Zealand white rabbits were grafted with either acellular collagen-GAG/Silastic membrane or collagen-GAG/Silastic membrane previously seeded with cultured autogenous fibroblasts. Over 63 days, wound sites were analyzed at intervals based on wound contraction and histology. Cutaneous wound successfully incorporated grafted collagen-GAG matrix and were significantly inhibited in their rate and extent of wound contraction. Seeding membrane matrices with autogenous, cultured fibroblasts before grafting caused a marked increase in cellularity that persisted throughout the postgraft period. In mucosa, matrices were exteriorized rather than incorporated. This work suggests that collagen-GAG/Silastic bilayer may have value as a dermal substitute and, more significantly, may be appropriate as a vehicle for delivering culture-selected fibroblasts to cutaneous wound sites.\r"

Each TMJ of four Macaca fascicularis adult monkeys was surgically exposed, and a 4- to 6-mm perforation at the posterolateral portion of the avascular disc was produced by electrosurgery. Four monkeys were used as controls. The animals were killed 11 weeks (two experimental and two controls) or 12 weeks (two experimental and two controls) after disc perforation. The perforations were increased in size in five joints, and healed in one joint. In addition, two joints of one animal showed complete loss of the disc, denudation of articular surfaces, and bone-to-bone contact. In contrast to control joints, the experimental joints exhibited the following changes histopathologically: thick, highly cellular and fibrillated fibrous coverings of articular surfaces (five joints); marked hyperplasia of synovial membrane; migration of synovial cells on the surfaces of the disc and margins of perforation; multiple adhesions of disc to articular surfaces; increase in cellularity and vascularity of discs; and chondrocytic clustering in temporal fibrous covering; and osteophytes of condylar and temporal components and focal or complete denudation of articular surfaces (2 joints). Most of these changes were consistent with the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. From this study, one can conclude that disc perforation can lead to osteoarthritis.\r"

All patients underwent a detailed examination to exclude other known organic causes of the pain. The gastroduodenal motor activity during fasting was studied with a semiconductor recording probe. The recordings were analyzed for periodicity, duration, and propagation velocity of the activity front of the migrating motor complex. The amplitude of the antral and duodenal contractions was also determined. The patients with recurrent abdominal pain had more frequent migrating motor complexes, but these were shorter in duration and moved more slowly down the intestine (slower propagation velocities). The patients also had high-pressure duodenal contractions that were associated with abdominal pain during the study period. These studies suggest that altered intestinal motility may be the underlying mechanism of recurrent abdominal pain in some children.\r"

At a mean follow-up age of 28.8 months (range 5 to 59), 18 infants (38%) had been hospitalized a total of 30 times for acute respiratory distress. At the time of admission, 18 infants (60%) were less than 12 months, 8 (27%) between 12 and 24 months, and 4 more than 2 years of age. The RSV was identified in seven hospitalized infants, as determined by fluorescent antibody, immunoassay, or culture. Before admission with RSV infection, one of the seven infants had chronic respiratory signs, none had Brasfield chest x-ray scores below 20, and a previous throat culture was positive for Staphylococcus aureus in one infant. Hospitalizations were prolonged (mean duration 22 days), and were characterized by significant morbidity, with three infants (43%) requiring mechanical ventilation and five infants (71%) requiring home oxygen therapy for persistent hypoxemia at discharge. At a mean follow-up age of 26 months, these infants more frequently have chronic respiratory signs (p less than 0.01) and lower chest radiograph scores (p less than 0.05) than other CF infants. These findings demonstrate that RSV is an important cause of early acute respiratory tract morbidity in young infants with CF, and suggest the need for studying new strategies to implement early and aggressive antiviral therapy in young infants with CF.\r"

Only one infant of the mothers who used cocaine died of SIDS, a risk of 5.6 in 1000, compared with four infants among the 821 nonexposed infants, a risk of 4.9 in 1000. The relative risk for SIDS among infants whose mothers used cocaine during pregnancy compared with those whose mothers did not use cocaine was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.13, 10.43), suggesting that there is no increased risk of SIDS among infants exposed in utero to cocaine.\r"

This questionnaire assessed the relationship between the decisions and the prognostications, and compared their accuracy with that of outcome studies. Each pediatrician completed a questionnaire for two of three possible cases, which were identically described as infants with meningomyelocele and complete paraplegia varying only in the degree of hydrocephalus at birth from none to moderate to severe. Recommendations for treatment and prognostications (the Prognostics Belief Scale of Impressions of adult functional capabilities and likely residential and vocational placements) were compared. Significantly fewer pediatricians would present information to parents in an encouraging light, and significantly fewer would treat their own child, if the case involved severe hydrocephalus in comparison with no hydrocephalus. Pediatricians' prognostications were the least optimistic for the infant with severe hydrocephalus and most optimistic for the infant without hydrocephalus, and they were considerably less optimistic than seems justified on the basis of follow-up studies. Last, physicians' less-than-optimistic prognoses were significantly related to their decisions concerning surgery for the infants with moderate and severe hydrocephalus. The major import of the findings is that pediatricians' prognoses reflect, in part, a misconception of the impact of hydrocephalus on children born with meningomyelocele and that these prognoses then have and impact on the pediatricians' decisions concerning treatment.\r"

He died of liver failure at age 5 months. There were increased levels of very long chain fatty acids and trihydroxycoprostanic acid in serum, and increased excretion of dicarboxylic acids and tyrosine metabolites in the urine. Levels of peroxisomal enzymes, acyl coenzyme A oxidase, bifunctional protein, 3-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase in the liver tissue from the patient were all deficient, findings consistent with Zellweger syndrome. However, immunocytochemical study and electron microscopic examination of the liver at autopsy revealed that hepatic peroxisomes were present at a level similar to that in a control subject. These observations suggest further heterogeneity in Zellweger syndrome and a different pathogenesis in this variant case.\r"

Follow-up at 2 years included neurologic examination and the determination of a Bayley mental score. Clear abnormality (death, cerebral palsy, or developmental delay) was found in four infants in the preeclampsia group and five in the asphyxia group; slight abnormality was found in 12 and 6 infants, respectively; and no abnormality was found in the remainder. Neither arginine vasopressin values nor hypoxanthine values predicted adverse outcome in either study group. A high erythropoietin level was found in infants born after preeclampsia regardless of outcome: normal outcome (geometric mean (GM), 102; 95% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 153 mU/ml), slightly abnormal outcome (GM, 100; 95% CI, 37 to 270 mU/ml) or clearly abnormal outcome (GM, 84; 95% CI, 19 to 378 mU/ml). However, asphyxiated infants with clearly abnormal outcome had higher erythropoietin values (GM, 67; 95% CI, 33 to 137 mU/ml; p less than 0.05) than the normal infants (GM, 37; 95% CI, 23 to 59 mU/ml). We conclude that a high erythropoietin level after normal pregnancy, but not after preeclampsia, indicates an increased risk for cerebral palsy or death.\r"

LBM% decreased exponentially with increasing gestational age in both small for gestational age (SGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants. In preterm SGA and AGA infants LBM was 104% and 103%, respectively, indicating that no fat was detectable. In term SGA infants LBM was 98%, which corresponded to 48 gm fat on average, and in term AGA infants LBM was 87%, which corresponded to 452 gm fat on average. The LBM%, ponderal index, and skinfold thickness were significantly different between AGA and SGA infants. Infants with clinical signs of intrauterine wastage had significantly higher LBM% than did infants without signs of weight loss. Our results on LBM% by dual photon absorptiometry agree with earlier dissection data; the clinically applicable methods of (1) height combined with weight (i.e., ponderal index), (2) skinfold thickness, and (3) scoring by clinical observations are useful for the estimation of lack of fat as an indicator of intrauterine growth retardation.\r"

In neonates, the observed cardiac output was 198 +/- 46 ml/kg.min in the preterm infants and 178 +/- 46 ml/kg.min in the term infants. Extrapolating animal data to the neonates, we found the thoracic segment length recommended (the average of 29% of body length and electrode distance) to be accurate. These data indicate that bioimpedance cardiac output measurement (1) is comparable to measurement by the thermodilution indicator technique in the newborn animal and (2) may be suitable for use in infants and children.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the efficacy of medical therapy, consisting of liquid bismuth subsalicylate prescribed either in combination with oral ampicillin (n = 15) or alone (n = 1), in the clearing of bacterial colonization on the antrum in 16 children with Campylobacter pylori-associated antral gastritis. We also examined the effects of medical treatment on altering the severity of associated antral inflammation. Eight patients had upper gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, two had acute gastric outlet obstruction, and 10 had symptoms of episodic epigastric abdominal pain. Duodenal ulcers were demonstrated in 10 of the 16 patients; in the other six, C. pylori-associated antral gastritis was documented without evidence of acute peptic ulceration. Seven days after a 6-week course of medical therapy, repeat upper endoscopy plus mucosal biopsy specimens showed that C. pylori colonization of the antrum had cleared in 12 of the 16 (75%) patients. Inflammation in the antrum improved in all patients in whom colonization by C. pylori was eradicated. In contrast, in the four with persistent colonization of the antrum, the severity of antral gastritis had not improved (p less than 0.01). Clinical symptoms improved in 9 of 12 patients in whom C. pylori colonization was no longer present, whereas subjective symptoms were unaffected in those with continued bacterial colonization of the antrum (p less than 0.05). We conclude that oral bismuth subsalicylate, in conjunction with ampicillin, can eradicate C. pylori colonization of the antrum, and that clearing of C. pylori is correlated with an improvement in the associated antral gastritis and clinical symptoms. These findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that these gastric organisms could play an etiologic role in primary antral gastritis and peptic ulcer disease.\r"

In the treatment group, two patients died in the early weeks of the disease. Analysis of clinical and laboratory data showed no significant difference between either group of patients as to the evolution of their illness except for a significantly higher incidence of anuria and a significantly faster recovery from hypertension in the treated group. Renal biopsy studies showed no differences between the two groups in terms of incidence and severity of the histologic lesions. The long-term data on blood pressure and creatinine clearance values in the survivors were similar in both groups. This study indicates that treatment with heparin and dipyridamole has no benefit over symptomatic therapy alone in the typical form of childhood hemolytic-uremic syndrome.\r"

Blood chemistry values were in the normal range, but fat body mass and lean body mass were reduced and extracellular water volume was expanded beyond normal values. Resting energy expenditure was reduced to 49% to 91% of values predicted by the Harris-Benedict equations. Substrate use after overnight fast indicated an abnormally high use of carbohydrates. Significant correlations were found between extracellular water volume and triceps skin-fold thickness, mid-arm muscle circumference and lean body mass, and substrate use and weight loss as a percentage of initial weight. We suggest that these simple anthropometric measurements can be used to assess and monitor the refeeding of patients with anorexia nervosa.\r"

Extracellular water was measured as the bromide space after oral bromide administration. A gradual increase was noted in weight, fat body mass, fat-free body mass, and total body potassium during refeeding. Extracellular water was expanded on admission and increased in all patients in the first weeks of treatment; later it fell to normal. Most of the changes in fat-free body mass over the first weeks of refeeding could be accounted for by an expansion in extracellular water. Particular care must therefore be taken with fluid balance during the first few weeks of refeeding.\r"

Hypotheses were tested with the use of a national random sample of sexually active female adolescents (n = 1426), aged 15 to 20 years, from Cycle III of the National Survey of Family Growth. The data were analyzed with Pearson correlation coefficients and multiple regression analysis. Noncompliance with the initial birth control method was the strongest predictor of the adolescents' contraceptive behavior at the time of the interview. Not acquiring birth control at the initial family planning visit and the frequency of family planning visits during the previous 12 months were the second and third best predictors of subjects' contraceptive use. Coital frequency and the length of time between first coitus and the initiation of birth control each explained a small amount of additional variation in the regression model. When combined, these five variables explained 40% of the variation in the contraceptive behavior of this representative sample of sexually active female adolescents. The findings could be useful for clinicians in providing more effective birth control counseling to adolescent patients.\r"

Preincubation with either PHI or PKC activator decreased maximum VIP-stimulated AC activity and decreased the number of cell surface VIP-R. A [125I]VIP binding assay using solubilized VIP-R of the plasma membrane and light vesicle fractions from sucrose density step gradients was developed as a more direct measure of VIP-R internalization. Preincubation with PHI or PMA decreased plasma membrane fraction [125I]VIP binding and increased binding in the light vesicle fraction, thus providing the most direct evidence to date for translocation of VIP-R per se from the plasma membrane to another, presumably intracellular, compartment. Two experimental approaches differentiated between agonist and PKC activator regulation of VIP-R/AC. The protein kinase inhibitors H-7 and staurosporine blocked mezerein-, but not PHI-, induced losses of cell surface VIP-R. Also, down-regulation of PKC did not block PHI-induced loss of cell surface VIP-R. Thus, although both agonist and PKC activators can lead to desensitization and internalization of VIP-R, PKC is apparently not involved in the mechanisms of agonist-induced desensitization.\r"

This work, done at physiological pH, expands previous results obtained at pH 8.3. Phenytoin (PHT) produces an allosteric increase in the binding of [3H]DM, which is more marked than that reported previously: PHT (100 microM,) at pH 7.4, increased the binding affinity of [3H]DM to brain homogenates 4-fold, without changing the concentration of DM sites. Moreover, ropizine (SC-13504) an anticonvulsant benzhydryl piperazine, also produced a marked concentration-dependent increase in the binding of [3H]DM, which is mediated by a decrease in the dissociation rate of [3H]DM. Importantly, the effects of ropizine are fully apparent at 10 microM, 10-fold lower than those of PHT. The effects of PHT and ropizine show that the affinity of the DM sites can be increased by other ligands, suggesting that these sites are located on macromolecules that can exist in at least two conformational states. [3H]DM also binds to peripheral tissues, but the brain displays the highest affinity. Besides, the central and peripheral sites are different as determined by competition studies with caramiphen and carbetapentane, which are DM site ligands with antitussive and anticonvulsant activity. The results reported in this communication are consistent with the hypothesis that the high-affinity DM binding sites mediate antitussive and anticonvulsant activity when occupied by the appropriate ligand.\r"

These antibodies were used for development of a radioimmunoassay that has a linear standard curve (r2 = 0.986) ranging from 0.5 to 10.0 ng/ml of pyridostigmine bromide in a 0.1-ml plasma sample. This assay measures pyridostigmine in plasma with better sensitivity and much greater through-put than do current state-of-the-art high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. In addition, only small volumes (100 microliter) of the plasma samples are required. Plasma levels of pyridostigmine were determined in the rat after intramuscular administration (0.056 mg/kg) of pyridostigmine bromide. Estimates of the various pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the computer program NONLIN84. The results were as follows: apparent volume of distribution = 1.97 l/kg, absorption rate constant = 0.277 min-1, elimination rate constant = 0.0273 min-1, area under the curve = 1010 ng x min/ml, absorption rate half-life = 2.41 min, elimination rate half-life = 24.8 min, maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) = 21.3 ng/ml and time to Cmax = 9.02 min.\r"

Anesthetized open-chest dogs were pretreated with i.v. saline, SQ 29,548 (0.20 mg/kg + 0.20 mg/kg/hr) or diltiazem (0.18 mg/kg) 15 min before the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded. In another group, animals were given saline, SQ 29,548 or diltiazem 1 min before reperfusion. The occlusion was maintained for 15 min and reperfusion instituted for 5 hr. Subendocardial segmental shortening was monitored throughout the experiment using sonomicrometry. Left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion resulted in marked systolic bulging to similar levels in all groups. Upon reperfusion, function returned immediately but, after several min, hypokinesia existed in saline-treated animals. At 5-hr postreperfusion, percentage of shortening returned to only 20% of base-line values in saline-treated animals. Both diltiazem and SQ 29,548 pretreatment resulted in significant (P less than .05) improvements in function such that at 5-hr postreperfusion, shortening returned to 60% of base-line values. When given immediately before reperfusion, SQ 29,548 still resulted in significant protection of function, although this occurred much later compared to pretreated animals. Diltiazem did not improve function when given immediately before reperfusion. SQ 29,548 improves reperfusion function and, thus by inference, thromboxane A2 may play a role in postischemic hypokinesia and some of its protective effects may occur during reperfusion. Diltiazem seems to protect reperfusion function only when present during ischemia per se.\r"

Infusions of terbutaline produced renal vasodilation in all age groups with maximal increases being higher in fetal (47 +/- 7%) than in newborn (30 +/- 8%) or adult sheep (24 +/- 5%). Terbutaline-mediated renal vasodilation was inhibited by the selective beta 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551, whereas infusion of selective beta 1 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 89,406, had no effect. Moreover, terbutaline effects were unchanged after phentolamine infusion to inhibit potential antagonistic effects of neuronal norepinephrine release by presynaptic beta 2 adrenoceptor stimulation. Renal arterial infusion of forskolin produced renal vasodilation of similar magnitude in all age groups, with maximal increases of 46 +/- 5, 38 +/- 3 and 38 +/- 5% in fetal, newborn and adult sheep, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that renal vasodilatory mechanisms stimulated by selective activation of beta 2 adrenoceptors (terbutaline) are greater during fetal life. However, direct activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin produces essentially similar renal vasodilatory responses during development in sheep. Thus, reasons to explain age-dependent differences in renal vasodilation observed previously with endogenous catecholamines may be at the receptor-hormone level.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro effects of a tertiary amine, 4-methyl piperidine analog of hemicholinium-3 (A-4), were investigated on acetylcholine (ACh) metabolism in rat striatal slices. Rat striatal slices were incubated in the presence of 1.0 microM [3H]-choline in the presence or absence of 0.1 mM A-4. High pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection was utilized to separate and measure total and [3H]-labeled ACh and choline. The effects of A-4 on [3H]-choline uptake, ACh and choline content, ACh release, and specific activity of ACh and choline tissue pools were investigated. Results indicated that A-4 inhibited the uptake of [3H]-choline into the striatal slices. Addition of 0.1 mM A-4 also produced a significant reduction in ACh content and ACh release and reduced the specific activity of the tissue choline and ACh pools. The effects of A-4 were more prominent upon immediate incubation than after a 60-min preincubation. These studies demonstrate that the pharmacological effects exhibited by A-4 are consistent with inhibition of choline uptake, with subsequent reduction in ACh synthesis and release.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of histamine's H1-receptor-mediated positive inotropic effect, a response which is not associated with an increase in cyclic AMP levels. We found that the concentration-response curve for the positive inotropic effect of histamine on cavian left atrium was similar to that of the alpha-1 agonist phenylephrine, in terms of slope and maximum response. Additionally, both agents slightly prolonged time-to-peak tension and relaxation times. In contrast, the concentration-response relationship for the beta-agonist isoproterenol, whose positive inotropic effect is mediated by an increase in cyclic AMP, had a steeper slope and a much greater maximum. Furthermore, isoproterenol abbreviated time-to-peak tension and relaxation times. As reported previously for alpha-1 agonists, the development of the contractile response to a submaximal histamine concentration (10 microM) coincided with a rapid increase in left atrial tissue levels of inositol triphosphate. The concentration-response curves for histamine effects on contractility and phosphoinositide (PI) turnover were both unaffected by the H2-antagonist tiotidine, but were shifted markedly to the right by the H1-antagonist pyrilamine. High-performance liquid chromatography techniques were applied to resolve the various inositol mono-, di- and tri-phosphate isomers and to assess the possible production of higher phosphates (IP4, IP5 and IP6) in control and histamine-treated (10 microM) atria. Under both conditions IP products were qualitatively similar, but quantitatively greater after treatment with histamine; these products included inositol(1)phosphate, inositol(4)phosphate,inositol(1,4)diphosphate and inositol(1,4,5)triphosphate. No evidence of higher phosphate production was obtained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Characterization studies revealed [3H]NIT binding to synaptosomes to be specific, rapid and saturable, occurring at a single population of sites. The Bmax was 51 fmol/mg of protein and Kd 0.22 nM with a Hill slope of 0.96. Studies with nifedipine and verapamil demonstrated that the latter binds to a site allosterically linked to the 1,4-dihydropyridine binding sites in spinal cord. The Ca++ channel agonist methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)-pyridine-5 carboxylate acted competitively at the 1,4-dihydropyridine binding site and inhibited specific [3H]NIT binding completely. Organic Ca++ antagonists inhibited binding to various degrees. Treatment with EDTA reduced specific [3H]NIT binding in spinal cord by 83%. This was restored by externally added Ca++. The effect of various mono-, di- and trivalent cations on specific [3H]NIT binding as well as its restoration in EDTA-treated preparations was tested. Na+, K+, Li+, Ca++, Mg++, Mn++ and Ba++ were found to have no significant effect. Other cations inhibited binding of [3H]NIT in the sequence La greater than Cd++ greater than Cu++ greater than Co++. Regional studies in rat spinal cord demonstrated 3-fold higher specific [3H]NIT binding sites in the dorsal cord compared to the ventral cord. Moreover, further variations were also found in cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord. The results demonstrate that binding of the labeled calcium antagonist in spinal cord membranes is of high affinity and completely reversible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists B-HT 920 and B-HT 933 on fluid and electrolyte transport in mammalian small intestine were assessed in vitro and in vivo. In Ussing flux chamber preparations of rabbit ileum, B-HT 920 reduces basal short-circuit current (Isc) in a concentration-dependent manner. This in vitro effect is inhibited by rauwolscine (KB = 9.7 nM) but not by prazosin. Isotope flux and ion replacement studies suggest that this decrease in Isc is due primarily to stimulation of a HCO3-dependent transport process. B-HT 920 promptly attenuates the 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2)-stimulated increase in Isc and completely reverses dmPGE2-stimulated Cl secretion to absorption. Oral administration of B-HT 933 dose-dependently inhibits dmPGE2-induced enteropooling in conscious rats. This effect of B-HT 933 is likewise blocked significantly by rauwolscine but not by prazosin. Similar effects of B-HT 933 are observed on enteropooling in the pithed rat as are the effects of B-HT 920 in the conscious rat. These results indicate that selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists from the azepine class of compounds have significant proabsorptive and antisecretory activities in the rabbit small intestine in vitro and in the rat intestine in vivo. This in vivo effect does not appear to be central nervous system mediated. These studies suggest that these alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists may be useful in converting the hypersecreting mammalian small bowel to its normal absorptive state.\r"

  ".W": "Incubation of striatal synaptosomes with L-dopa and glucose in either the presence or absence of 10 microM reserpine resulted in a rise in the level of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) within the isolated tissue pellet. The rise in GSSG was concentration dependent in the range of 0.04-1.0 mM L-dopa. With 1.0 mM L-dopa in the presence of reserpine, the GSSG level was elevated by 7.0 +/- 0.7 pmol/mg original striatal tissue, which corresponds to an increase of 38.0 +/- 4.5% compared with control. The rise in GSSG reflects an oxidative stress. The oxidation of dopamine by monoamine oxidase generates H2O2, which is normally detoxified by glutathione peroxidase to yield GSSG. In the presence of clorgyline or pargyline (two monoamine oxidase inhibitors), the rise in GSSG was suppressed by 88-92%, as was the formation of DOPAC. NSD-1055 and carbidopa (two inhibitors of dopa-decarboxylase) also significantly suppressed (50-60%) the rise in GSSG. These data show that the synthesis of dopamine from L-dopa, with subsequent catabolism of dopamine, can evoke a significant rise in the level of GSSG, which reflects the oxidant stress associated with monoamine oxidase activity.\r"

In Experiment 1, ethanol, 8.25% w/v was given by gavage (7/day) for 4 days, with doses titrated to maintain moderate intoxication. After termination of ethanol, the rats exhibited mild overt signs of withdrawal and, in discrimination tests with saline as the test substance, they selected the PTZ lever, an effect reversed by ethanol, 2 g/kg, and by diazepam, 5 mg/kg. In Experiment 2, rats drank a nutritionally complete liquid diet containing ethanol, 4.5% w/v, for 1 week. They became tolerant to the intoxicating effect of ethanol, and blood ethanol concentration mounted with continued dosing. On termination of chronic ethanol, rats selected the PTZ lever before the onset of overt physical signs of withdrawal, and both measures returned to base line within 3 days. In Experiment 3 the percentage of rats selecting the PTZ lever after termination of ethanol depended upon the dose (up to 12.5 g/kg) and duration (up to a ceiling effect by 3 days) of ethanol administered chronically. These results indicate that a PTZ-like stimulus produced interoceptively can be demonstrated in the rat as an objective measure of ethanol withdrawal. This paradigm may provide insight into the symptom of anxiety associated with ethanol withdrawal.\r"

  ".W": "The effects is of the optical isomers of pimobendan (UD-CG 115 BS), an inotropic agent, were studied on the electrical and mechanical activity of intact and detergent-skinned preparations of cardiac muscle from guinea pig and dog. Racemic pimobendan has been shown to increase contractile force and to potentiate slow action potentials (AP) induced by stimulation of papillary muscle partially depolarized with 25 mM [K]o. These effects are shown in this study to be mainly due to the l-optical isomer of pimobendan. When slow APs were maximally stimulated by 1 microM isoproterenol, addition of either the d- or l-isomer of pimobendan did not affect the slow AP parameters. However, under these conditions, contractile force was significantly increased to 124% of control by the d-isomer and to 184% of control by the l-isomer. These results suggest that pimobendan may have direct effects on the myofilaments and that these effects are dependent on the optical isomer of the compound. To test this directly, the effects of d- and l-pimobendan were compared on Ca++-activated force developed by detergent-skinned heart muscle fibers. Submaximal force developed at constant Ca++ was increased by both optical isomers, but the l-isomer had a significantly greater Ca++-sensitizing effect. For example at pCa 6.75 force was 270% of control in the presence of the d-isomer and 400% of control in the presence of the l-isomer. At pCa 5, there was no effect of either isomer on force developed by the skinned fiber preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to maintain functional tolerance to several effects of ethanol. The ability of exogenous vasopressin (administered i.c.v.) to maintain tolerance to the hypnotic effect of ethanol was blocked more effectively by antagonists acting at V1 receptors than by a V2-selective antagonist. Similarly, a V1-selective agonist was more potent than AVP in maintaining tolerance, whereas V2-selective agonists were inactive. These results indicate that vasopressin maintains ethanol tolerance via an action at CNS receptors that have the characteristics of V1 vasopressin receptors. Furthermore, a V1-selective antagonist, given alone, enhanced the rate of loss of tolerance, whereas a V2-selective antagonist did not, supporting a role for endogenous AVP, also acting at V1 vasopressin receptors, in the maintenance of ethanol tolerance. Characterization of the CNS receptors that mediate the modulation of ethanol tolerance by vasopressin suggests a mechanism of action of the peptide hormone in the CNS, and may contribute to the eventual development of therapies to modify functional ethanol tolerance.\r"

Horizontal locomotion was increased considerably by these compounds in a dose-related manner. This hyperactivity was accompanied by an initial decrease in investigatory holepokes and rearings followed by a subsequent increase at the highest doses tested. Rats injected with these phenylethylamine derivatives also exhibited thigmotaxis and a tendency to avoid the center of the experimental chamber, a behavioral profile similar to hallucinogen-like drugs. Consequently, a disruption of the spatial patterns of locomotion was also observed. Analyses of these patterns revealed an increasing tendency toward more stereotyped, predictable locomotor paths with increasing dose. Rats circled around the perimeter of the chamber with individual animals demonstrating a predominant though not completely consistent direction of rotation. The methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced increase in locomotion remained significantly elevated up to 4 hr after injection at a 10 mg/kg dose, whereas other aspects of motor activity returned to base-line levels more rapidly. Thus, methylenedioxymethamphetamine and N-ethyl-methylenedioxyamphetamine seem to possess both psychomotor stimulant properties and elements of a hallucinogen-like behavioral profile.\r"

In addition, we investigated the selectivity of the releasing effects of 48/80 for HA compared to other neurotransmitters. Brain slices from W/W mice, a genetic mutant devoid of mast cells, and +/+ mice, its normal counterpart, were used. Hypothalamic slices were labeled with [3H]HA or [3H]histidine. 48/80 elicited similar degrees of release of [3H]HA from both mouse strains, irrespective of the label used. In addition, 48/80 produced marked increases in the efflux of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and modest increases in the efflux of acetylcholine (ACh). These effects were concentration-dependent and the magnitude of release varied with the transmitter examined (DA greater than NE greater than 5-HT much greater than ACh = HA). Transmitter efflux induced by 48/80 was not altered by low calcium concentrations or by tetraethylammonium; whereas, release evoked by electrical stimulation was reduced and increased, respectively, by these treatments. In mouse striatal slices preloaded with [3H]DA, 48/80 induced an initial increase in [3H]DA efflux, followed by a marked increase in the efflux of its metabolite, [3H]-3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Nomifensine failed to inhibit, whereas reserpine pretreatment reduced 48/80-induced efflux of 3H. In summary, these results indicate that the incubation of hypothalamic slices with [3H]HA or [3H]histidine labels HA neurons selectively and that 48/80 (10-100 micrograms/ml) releases HA from nonmast cell compartments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Under this procedure subjects are required to emit a new sequence of responses each session to receive access to food. All three drugs reduced overall key pecking rates although naloxone's rate-reducing effect was limited to the highest dose (30 mg/kg). The dose-effect curves for overall key pecking rate under buprenorphine and methadone were similar though the effective dose range for buprenorphine appeared wider. Methadone increased percentage of total errors at the highest doses, but neither buprenorphine nor naloxone affected total error levels very much. Within-session errors were increased early in the session under high methadone doses. Low buprenorphine doses also showed some tendency to increase errors early in the session. Buprenorphine and methadone reduced the number of chains completed in a dose-dependent manner. Buprenorphine was also administered daily at the most behaviorally disruptive dose (10 mg/kg/day). Under this dosing schedule, the behavior-suppressing effects of buprenorphine returned to base-line levels within 4 days. Error rates were unaffected by daily buprenorphine administration.\r"

M3G was produced in the fetal lamb and accumulated extensively in fetal plasma and amniotic fluid. Seizure activity was observed in two fetal lambs with extremely high plasma concentrations of M3G and MOR. The molar ratio of M3G to MOR in fetal plasma was dependent upon the duration of infusion, reaching a plateau of 60 at about 3 days, but appeared to be independent of the infusion rate over the range studied, 3 to 30 mg hr-1. Maternal plasma MOR and M3G concentrations were substantially less than corresponding fetal plasma concentrations. Using the steady-state plasma concentration of M3G obtained from infusion of MOR and the clearance of M3G derived from single injection of M3G to fetal lambs, the fraction of MOR converted to M3G by the fetus was calculated to be 0.63. Although MOR is conjugated to glucuronic acid in the fetal lamb and excreted into the amniotic fluid it is not readily transferred across the epitheliochorial placenta to the ewe because of restricted permeability.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to study the effect of the beta adrenergic antagonist, carteolol, on the endothelium-dependent responsiveness of isolated arteries. Rings of canine coronary arteries were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording; carteolol inhibited the relaxation to isoproterenol and abolished the difference in responsiveness to the beta adrenergic agonist between rings with and without endothelium. Carteolol did not cause endothelium-dependent relaxations of femoral or coronary arteries. In bioassay experiments, carteolol augmented the basal release of relaxing factors from the endothelium of the femoral artery; this effect was prevented by indomethacin. In rings of femoral arteries, carteolol increased the endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist UK 14,304; this was not affected by indomethacin but prevented by propranolol. Carteolol did not modify the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine, adenosine diphosphate, bradykinin, thrombin and the Ca+-ionophore A23187. Carteolol inhibited the endothelium-dependent hypoxic contraction of the canine coronary artery. It did not affect endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine in the aorta of the spontaneously hypertensive rat. These experiments suggest that carteolol facilitates the abluminal release of endothelium-dependent relaxing factor caused by alpha-2 adrenergic activation, and causes the intraluminal release of vasodilator prostaglandins. The compound prevents the endothelium-dependent contractions which are not mediated by products of cyclooxygenase. These actions may contribute to the vasodilatator properties of carteolol in the intact organism.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of gallamine to modify muscarinic receptor binding properties and to antagonize muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity was investigated in the rat myocardium. Gallamine caused parallel shifts to the right in the dose-response curves for inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by the highly efficacious muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M and the partial agonist Bm 5 [N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-4-pyrrolidino)-2-butynyl acetamide]. The nature of this effect was inconsistent with competitive inhibition, but could be explained by allosteric antagonism. Similar dissociation constants of 0.52 and 0.83 microM were estimated for gallamine on the basis of its ability to antagonize responses to oxotremorine-M and Bm 5, respectively. The maximum shift in the dose-response curve of Bm 5 caused by gallamine was 90-fold, whereas that of oxotremorine-M was only 49-fold. When measured by inhibition of the binding of the specific muscarinic antagonist [3H]N-methylscopolamine, the dissociation constant of gallamine was estimated to be 1.1 microM. The present results illustrate good agreement between the ability of gallamine to modify muscarinic receptor binding properties and to antagonize muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in the rat heart.\r"

  ".W": "In the rat and mouse when morphine is coadministered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) in the brain and intrathecally (i.t.) in the spinal cord, a multiplicative (synergistic) interaction occurs for the antinociceptive response. In the male Swiss Cox mouse, with the development of a high degree of systemic tolerance to morphine, this multiplicative interaction decreases (becomes additive), whereas no change occurs in the ED50 for the i.c.v. or i.t. site itself. The purpose of the present study was to extend these findings in one mouse strain to other strains in order to determine how generally applicable such findings are to the phenomenon of tolerance to morphine. Eight different strains of outbred mice were used in the antinociceptive tail-flick test to quantify the multiplicative interaction of simultaneous administration (i.c.v. and i.t.) in relation to the amount of tolerance developed to morphine administered systemically (s.c.). Even though the control ED50 values for s.c. morphine were similar among strains, the amounts of tolerance developed by 3 days of implantation of a morphine pellet were very different (2-18-fold). A relationship was found between the degree of tolerance developed to s.c. morphine and changes in the multiplicative interaction (as reflected by changes in the i.c.v. plus i.t. morphine ED50 values). In control animals, a multiplicative i.c.v.-i.t. interaction was produced in six of the eight strains, whereas an additive interaction was shown in the remaining two strains. With 3 days of morphine pellet implantation, in three strains which developed a large amount of tolerance to s.c. morphine (7-18-fold), the multiplicative interaction decreased to an additive interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

IBO and EPN increased levels of epinephrine (EPI) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in both brain areas without significantly affecting the concentration of other catecholamines. Inhibition of either dopamine beta-hydroxylase, the neuronal EPI and norepinephrine uptake system, or esterase hydrolysis of IBO prevented the increase of EPI, whereas inhibition of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, enzymatic dealkylation or the neuronal dopamine or serotonin uptake system had no influence on the increase of EPI levels. These results suggest that IBO after hydrolysis to EPN can be converted enzymatically to EPI by dopamine beta-hydroxylase in hypothalamus and brainstem. EPN seems to be accumulated into adrenergic and noradrenergic neurons by the high affinity uptake system. Changes in the EPI content of the central nervous system neurons might be responsible for some of the pharmacologic effects of IBO.\r"

The current study investigates whether increased in vivo stimulation of urinary bladder smooth muscle can alter muscarinic receptor density and response to muscarinic stimulation. A high degree of reflex stimulation of the urinary bladder (rabbits) was initiated by stricture of the external urethra. Intravesical pressure and intra-abdominal pressure were monitored continuously over a 4-hr time period. At the end of the 4-hr period, the rabbits were sacrificed and isolated strips of bladder body were either mounted in isolated smooth muscle baths for contractile studies or frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for muscarinic receptor analysis. These studies demonstrated that over 4 hr of urethral stricture there was a significant reduction in muscarinic receptor density from a Bmax of 34 +/- 3.4 fmol/mg of protein in control bladder strips to 22 +/- 2.4 fmol/mg of protein in the experimental group. In association with the decreased muscarinic receptor density, there was a significant and selective decrease in the contractile response to muscarinic stimulation. Similar to the in vivo studies, repetitive field stimulation of in vitro strips resulted in a significant decrease in muscarinic receptor density and a significant and selective decrease in the contractile response to muscarinic stimulation. The results from these studies indicate that muscarinic receptor density, and response to muscarinic stimulation, can be modulated over a relatively short period of time by alterations in the level of neuronal stimulation.\r"

Symptoms of intoxication were mild in DFP1 animals. DFP2 animals initially exhibited severe symptoms of DFP poisoning. However, by the fifth injection, symptoms were mild and it was concluded that the animals had become tolerant to DFP. Animals were sacrificed 24 hr after injection 1, 2 or 7. Acetylcholinesterase activity was depressed in both groups throughout the period of DFP administration. EPPs and MEPPs were recorded from the hemidiaphragm cut muscle preparation to monitor quantal release, binomial statistical parameters of release and spontaneous transmitter release. No significant changes in MEPP amplitude were observed. MEPP frequency was significantly depressed in both groups of DFP-treated animals. When stimulated at 50 Hz the second EPP of the train was significantly depressed relative to the first EPP in the DFP2-treated animals during the initial period of treatment. Quantal release and statistical release measurements were not affected by DFP treatment. The EPP duration was significantly increased in DFP1- and DFP2-treated animals. In DFP2-treated animals that had become tolerant to DFP, the EPP duration had shortened. It is concluded that tolerance development to chronic treatment with DFP is not associated with changes in presynaptic activity or changes in postsynaptic sensitivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Isomeric forms of each compound were found to be approximately equipotent inhibitors in the following preparations: inhibition of rabbit neuromuscular transmission using the sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle preparation, reductions in acetylcholine content in rat caudate tissue slices and inhibition of choline uptake in neuroblastoma cells, line NB41A3. Because these results show no difference in potency or reversibility for the stereoisomers of A-5 or A-4, these studies indicate that hydroxyl substitutions in these agents do not play a role in their biologic activity. Perhaps only 2-point attachment is required for inhibition of choline transport by hemicholinium-like compounds.\r"

In contrast, SK&F 104078 has been found to have essentially no affinity for prejunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the guinea pig atrium. To characterize further the pharmacology of SK&F 104078 we have examined its effects in several additional alpha-2 adrenoceptor models and on several non alpha adrenoceptor-mediated vascular responses. SK&F 104078 does not block the neuroinhibitory effect of alpha methylnorepinephrine in the guinea pig ileum. In contrast, in the rat vas deferens, high concentrations of SK&F 104078 (3-30 microM) antagonized the neuroinhibitory effect of UK 14,304; however, the antagonism was not competitive. At concentrations up to 1 microM, SK&F 104078 did not potentiate [3H]overflow from guinea pig vas deferens or guinea pig atrium prelabeled with [3H]norepinephrine, indicating no prejunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptor blocking activity in these tissues. SK&F 104078 is a competitive antagonist at alpha-1 adrenoceptors, and at 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors, as demonstrated by blockade of norepinephrine- and serotonin-induced contraction in the rabbit aorta, with KB values of 155 and 20 nM, respectively. At concentrations up to 10 microM, SK&F 104078 does not depress angiotensin II-induced contraction of rabbit aorta. At 1 microM, no depression of the response to Ca++ in depolarized rabbit aorta is observed, although a significant inhibition of this response is seen at 10 microM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The probe selected for this purpose was the prodrug [3H]acetorphan, a lipophilic diesterified derivative of the potent enkephalinase inhibitor thiorphan readily releasing the latter by tissue hydrolysis. In order to validate the in vivo binding assay, [3H]thiorphan binding to membranes was first studied in vitro. [3H]Thiorphan binding to cerebral and peripheral tissues (lung and kidney) was saturable over a low nonspecific binding, occurring with a KD of 0.6 nM consistent with the Ki of the compound as enkephalinase inhibitor. [3H]Thiorphan binding varied largely among various tissues and was highly correlated with the catalytic activity of enkephalinase, thus indicating a selective labeling of the peptidase. After the i.v. administration of [3H]acetorphan a large fraction of the radioactivity remained bound to membranes isolated by a rapid filtration assay. Bound radioactivity mainly corresponded to [3H] thiorphan as identified by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of kidney membranes, whereas unchanged [3H]acetorphan was not detectable. In vivo binding generated by [3H]acetorphan was saturable, with maximum binding sites values which were in rather good agreement with corresponding maximum binding sites values of [3H]thiorphan binding in vitro, particularly in brain. Specific in vivo binding was calculated as the difference between total and a generally low, nonspecific binding evaluated in mice receiving a large dose of nonlabeled acetorphan. Specific in vivo binding varied largely among tissues and generally reflected the abundance of enkephalinase molecules in the latter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The i.v. injection of PGE2 methyl ester (PGE2-Me), a lipophilic derivative of PGE2, resulted in hyperthermia 1.5-fold higher than that by PGE2 injection over the same dose range. The hyperthermia was associated with tachycardia, hypertension, cutaneous vasodilation and a rise in abdominal skin temperature. Using [3H]PGE2 and radioimmunoassay, we showed PGE2 to be transported into the brain immediately (15 sec) after the i.v. injection of the PG; the PGE2 content ranged from 2.3 +/- 0.5 to 102.6 +/- 5.5 ng/g of brain when given at 0.01 to 1.0 mg/kg, which was 0.07 to 0.13% of the administered dose. When [3H]PGE2-Me was used, the radioactivity in the brain at 15 sec after injection was 1.3- to 2.9-fold higher than that after [3H]PGE2 injection. However, 80% or more of PGE2-Me was hydrolyzed rapidly and recovered as PGE2 in the brain within 15 sec post-injection. PGE2-Me disappeared within 5 min. When PGE2 or PGE2-Me administered i.v. was followed in terms of PGE2, it decreased gradually in the brain with a half-life of 9.0 to 9.5 min in both cases, and was almost undetectable (less than 0.7 ng/g of brain) at the time when rectal temperature reached a peak.

Cyclosporin A was added to primary hepatocyte cultures just before taurocholate to study the immediate effects on transport. In prolonged exposure experiments cyclosporin A was dissolved in culture media. Efflux was studied by preloading cultured cells with [14C]taurocholate and then changing to sodium-free buffer containing no taurocholate. Cyclosporin A inhibited the uptake and efflux of taurocholate in a competitive manner when added just before determination of transport. Hepatocyte cultures which were pre-exposed to cyclosporin A (1-25 microM) for 18 hr and then washed, also showed a significantly lower taurocholate uptake. The longer the pre-exposure time the greater was the suppression. However, the inhibition could be reversed gradually by incubation of cultured cells in fresh media, complete reversal being attained within 3 hr. These results indicate that cyclosporin A competitively inhibits the taurocholate transport system. The interaction between cyclosporin A and transport components is rapid and long lasting but reversible.\r"

  ".W": "Although normal-retrograde liver perfusion allows definition of relative distribution patterns of multienzyme systems involved in parallel, competing and sequential metabolic pathways, the technique fails to describe localization patterns for unienzyme systems. A novel method of perfusion, which can describe the relative zonal enrichment of drug metabolizing activity of unienzyme systems in periportal region and in the entire liver, is described. The rat liver was perfused once-through with combined hepatic arterial (2 ml/min/liver-containing drug) and portal or hepatic venous (10 ml/min/liver, without drug) flows [HAPV and HAHV]. Because of known enrichment of phenacetin O-deethylation and acetaminophen sulfation activities in the perihepatic venous and periportal regions, respectively, metabolic data derived with these compounds were used for validation of the method. The overall steady-state hepatic extraction ratio of [3H]phenacetin during HAPV (0.88-0.98) was decreased markedly during HAHV (0.06-0.47), but was reduced to a lesser extent for preformed [3H]acetaminophen (0.57-0.86 for HAPV to 0.23-0.62 for HAHV). Because a comparison of metabolic activities encountered by substrate(s) [estimated from extraction ratios] required normalization to the intracellular water spaces accessed during both HAPV and HAHV, the multiple indicator dilution technique (a bolus injection of noneliminated reference materials: 51Cr-labeled RBC, 125I-labeled albumin, [14C]sucrose and 3H2O) into the hepatic artery during both HAPV and HAHV was used, with outflow profiles from the hepatic vein or portal vein characterized by rapid serial collections. Sinusoidal blood volume, albumin accessible Disse space, sucrose accessible Disse space and the estimated intracellular water space reached during HAHV were 48, 56, 53 and 33% those during HAPV. The ratios of intrinsic clearances per volume of cell water space for HAHV/HAPV, representing periportal activity/whole liver activity were: phenacetin O-deethylation, 0.34 and acetaminophen sulfation, 1.13. These findings validate the use of HAHV and HAPV perfusion for the examination of relative abundances of enzymic activities across the liver acinus for substrates metabolized by unienzyme systems.\r"

  ".W": "The aims of this study were to provide direct evidence that in anesthetized guinea pigs i.v. administration of histamine induces sympathoadrenal activation and to identify the source and mechanism of histamine-induced epinephrine release. Plasma epinephrine measurements were used as the index of sympathoadrenal activity. In intact guinea pigs, histamine infusion caused a 3-fold rise in plasma epinephrine levels. In guinea pigs pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine to obtain chemical sympathectomy, the rise in plasma epinephrine induced by histamine was distinctly smaller than in controls. This rise was completely inhibited in guinea pigs pretreated with the ganglion blocking agent hexamethonium and in pithed guinea pigs. Pretreatment with the H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine or the H1-receptor antagonist mepyramine reduced the rise in plasma epinephrine. These results demonstrate that in guinea pigs, epinephrine is released not only from the adrenal medulla but also from nerve endings and that histamine releases epinephrine by indirect action through central reflex pathways.\r"

  ".W": "This study attempts to analyze the inter-relationship between the slow fading of muscarinic antagonist action observed in isolated tissue preparations upon washout and the dissociation kinetics at the receptor level. Isolated guinea pig left atria stimulated electrically at 3 Hz were equilibrated with N-[3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) and the time course of release of [3H]NMS was studied. In parallel experiments, the fading of the antimuscarinic action of NMS was monitored by repeated determinations of the negative inotropic effect of oxotremorine. In comparison, the dissociation of [3H]NMS from muscarinic receptors was recorded in a membrane suspension of guinea pig right atria. Having been equilibrated at 10(-8) M [3H]NMS, the atria released [3H]NMS extremely slowly, when transferred into a drug-free washout bath: not even half of the initially bound [3H]NMS was lost within 3 hr. With a corresponding time course, 10(-8) M oxotremorine regained its negative inotropic action. In contrast, when 10(-4) M unlabeled NMS was present in the washout bath, it took only 5 min for the [3H]NMS binding to fall by 50%. Similarly, in a membrane-suspension of guinea pig right atria, the half-life time of the [3H]NMS receptor complexes amounted to about 5 min. It is concluded that the dissociation of NMS from its receptor sites proceeds with a half-life time of 5 min in intact atria as well as in the cardiac membrane suspension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In this study, chronic opioid antagonist-induced alterations in sensitivity to selective mu- and kappa-opioid agonists were examined. Administration of naloxone (0.5 mg/kg/hr) via osmotic minipumps eliminated the antinociception elicited by the mu-agonist, morphine, but did not affect that induced by the kappa-agonist, U50, 488H. After 1 week of treatment and after pump removal, dose-response curves for the induction of antinociception by morphine against noxious heat, pressure and electrical stimulation were shifted to the left across the entire time course of action: this supersensitivity subsided over a period of 1 week postremoval. No facilitation of the actions of U50,488H was seen. Three days of infusion also induced a significant supersensitivity to morphine but a single, acute high dose of naloxone (3.0 mg/kg) was ineffective. The effect of naloxone was dose-dependent (0.05-0.50 mg/kg/hr). Chronic treatment at 3.0 mg/kg/hr blocked the antinociception induced by both U50,488H and morphine. After 1 week and after pump removal, the antinociceptive action of U50,488H against pressure, but not heat, was enhanced; the antinociceptive action of morphine against both heat and pressure was facilitated. These data, in conjunction with our autoradiographical findings suggest: 1) it is possible to selectively block and up-regulate mu as compared to kappa receptors; 2) chronic treatment with naloxone can induce a supersensitivity to kappa-agonists; and 3) the pool of kappa-receptors acting antinociceptively against pressure may differ from that acting against heat.\r"

Slices from clonazepam-treated rats exhibited epileptiform activity evidenced by multiple extracellular population spikes after orthodromic stimulation. These slices also demonstrated abnormally steep and variable stimulus intensity-population spike curves. Intracellular recordings showed spontaneous bursts and slow paroxysmal depolarizations. To investigate the neuronal activity before and immediately after drug withdrawal, slices from drug-naive and drug-exposed rats were maintained in solution containing the approximate concentration of clonazepam (20 nM) measured in the cerebrospinal fluid of clonazepam-treated rats. Compared to CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices from drug-naive animals, neurons from clonazepam-administered animals showed an increased tendency to fire in a bursting (i.e., epileptiform) pattern when the cell was depolarized by current injection, or by orthodromic or antidromic stimulation. Upon withdrawal of clonazepam from the perfusate, the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials and spiking activity increased in cells from clonazepam-treated animals and was associated with a shortening of the long-lasting postspike train after hyperpolarization. However, no change in the dendritic gamma-aminobutyric acid response was noted. This study indicates that abnormal epileptiform activity can be detected and studied in brain slices from animals chronically treated with clonazepam.\r"

A similar disease is observed after ingestion of drugs which inhibit hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, or in subjects with various inborn defects in this metabolic pathway. We therefore determined the effects of amineptine on the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids in mice. In vitro, the formation of beta-oxidation products during incubation of palmitic acid with mouse liver mitochondria and the various cofactors necessary for beta-oxidation was inhibited by 27, 33, 46 and 57% respectively, in the presence of 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mM of amineptine. Inhibition was reversible. Tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, assessed by the in vitro formation of [14C]CO2 from [1-14C]acetyl coenzyme A by mouse liver mitochondria, was inhibited by 22, 23, 47, 54, 60 and 62%, respectively, in the presence of 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mM of amineptine.

  ".W": "Exposure of guinea pigs to 1% halothane in air for 4 hr resulted in extensive centrizonal hepatic necrosis in 70% of animals examined 2 to 3 days later. In contrast, confluent hepatic necrotic lesions were not present in animals studied 24 hr after halothane exposure; only microvascular fatty change of hepatocytes with occasional necrotic cells was observed at that time (in 84% of animals). This delayed onset of lesion development afforded the opportunity to study microsomal membrane composition and indices of Ca++ homeostasis before and after the onset of halothane-induced hepatic necrosis. Hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 levels were unaltered 24 hr after halothane exposure, but fell to approximately 50% of control values at 72 hr. This indicates that such changes were most likely the result of hepatocellular necrosis. Microsomal lipid composition, including the relative proportions of individual phospholipids, was unaltered during halothane-induced hepatotoxicity. In contrast, microsomal Ca++ sequestration, as assessed by 45Ca uptake, was reduced 24 hr after halothane exposure compared with controls (2.76 +/- 1.32 nmol/mg of protein per min, vs. 6.63 +/- 2.88 nmol/mg of protein per min, P less than .001). This early change in microsomal Ca++ uptake was associated with a 10-fold increase in total hepatic Ca++ content at 24 hr. Subsequent changes in hepatic Ca++ content were proportionate to the severity of liver necrosis. The observation that abnormalities of hepatic Ca++ homeostasis antedate the presence of liver cell necrosis is consistent with a role for altered Ca++ fluxes in the mechanism of halothane-induced liver injury.\r"

The distribution of binding sites for the A1 selective agonist, N6-[3H]-[(R)-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl]adenosine (R-[3H]PIA), was similar to the distribution of binding sites for [3H]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine [( 3H]NECA), an agonist that binds to A1 and A2 receptors with nearly equal affinities. Binding site densities were highest in the substantia gelatinosa, followed by lamina 10; the remainder of the spinal cord displayed uniformly low levels of binding sites. In each of these three areas, [3H]NECA bound to more sites than R-[3H]PIA. When the A1-selective agonist, N6-(cyclopentyl)adenosine, was used to block [3H]NECA binding to A1 receptors, the autoradiograms demonstrated a band of A2 receptor density which tended to be localized in the ventral portion of the substantia gelatinosa. Unilateral dorsal rhizotomy, hemitransection and complete transection of the spinal cord failed to alter the [3H]NECA or R-[3H]PIA binding in the substantia gelatinosa. In contrast, unilateral microinjections of kainic acid into the dorsal horn decreased [3H]NECA and R-[3H]PIA binding at the level of the injections by 42 and 37%, respectively. In some areas, kainic acid injection eliminated all R-[3H]PIA and [3H]NECA binding in the substantia gelatinosa. It is therefore concluded that spinal cord A1 and A2 adenosine receptors in the substantia gelatinosa are located predominantly on intrinsic neurons.\r"

Administration of the anticholinesterase agent, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) to areas responding to acetylcholine (i.e., rostral and caudal chemosensitive areas of the ventral surface of the medulla) in doses ranging from 12.5 to 50 micrograms bilaterally had minimal effects on cardiorespiratory activity. However, similar doses applied to the intermediate area of the ventral surface of the medulla produced an increase in tidal volume and hypotension. For example, a dose of 12.5 micrograms increased tidal volume by 14 +/- 3 ml (P greater than .05). Similar responses were seen with higher doses of DFP; in addition, respiratory depression (apnea) also occurred. This depression was characterized by a slowing in respiratory rate. The organophosphate compound, soman, in doses of 0.25 and 0.5 micrograms produced effects similar to those seen with DFP with the exception that an increase in respiratory rate was observed before the decrease in respiratory rate occurred. In addition, a greater degree of hypotension was observed with soman as compared to DFP. Findings comparable to those obtained with DFP were produced by the muscarinic receptor agonist, oxotremorine (0.077-10 micrograms). The effects of DFP, soman and oxotremorine were counteracted by locally applied atropine. In addition, measurements of acetylcholinesterase activity taken from the rostral, intermediate and caudal areas indicate a relatively low activity at the rostral area but a relatively high activity at the intermediate area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to determine if AAN pretreatment, which ameliorates hepatotoxicity, would also prevent the immunotoxicity associated with DMN exposure. Female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to either 3 or 6 mg/kg of DMN (in saline) or saline i.p. for 7 consecutive days. The animals were also treated (i.p.) twice daily, 1 hr before and 6 hr after DMN exposure, with either, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg of AAN (in saline) or saline. Mice were sensitized with sheep red blood cells i.v. on day 8. On day 12, body and organ weights were determined, serum chemistry and histopathology were evaluated and day 4 immunoglobulin M antibody response was measured. Hepatotoxicity caused by DMN, as reflected by an increase in body weight attributed to the production of ascites, a 485.7% increase in the serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase levels and histopathology was reversed by doses of AAN as low as 10 mg/kg. Conversely, doses of AAN as high as 100 mg/kg were unable to reverse the suppression of the antibody forming cells response to sheep red blood cells produced by DMN. The results of this investigation indicate that DMN-induced immunosuppression and hepatotoxicity can be separated and that an immunosuppressive metabolite of DMN is produced by an AAN-insensitive pathway.\r"

Bolus i.v. injection of angiotensin II (AII), 0.6 to 6.0 micrograms/kg, evoked a prompt shortlasting suppression of breathing, manifested mainly as a reduction in tidal volume susceptible to the development of tachyphylaxis if injections were spaced more closely than 30 min apart. Ablation of the area postrema failed to eliminate the respiratory effect of All. The response also persisted after midbrain transection, spinal cord transection at C8, dorsal rhizotomy of spinal segments C1 to C8 and interruption of cranial nerves V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII. No influence of All was evident on indirectly evoked tibialis muscle contractions and on pulmonary compliance. A reduction in phrenic nerve impulse traffic coincided with the respiratory response to All. Cranial i.a. injection of All initiated the respiratory effect in its first pass through the brain, before any change occurred in the blood pressure. The degree of All-induced respiratory inhibition was relatively constant at different magnitudes of breathing produced by CO2 inhalation or by electrical stimulation of the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata. It is concluded that All given by bolus intravascular injection causes respiratory inhibition through a direct central action at the final processing step in the CO2-tidal volume controller.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic ethanol consumption results in the induction of a specific hepatic cytochrome P-450 (P450IIE1). However, since compounds other than ethanol (i.e., acetone) can also serve as P450IIE1 inducers, and since ethanol given with a normal fat-containing (35% of energy) diet is associated with acetonemia, hepatic steatosis and decreased body weight gain, the question has been raised whether induction is mediated specifically by ethanol or whether it might represent a nonspecific response to these other factors. This was investigated by varying both the mode of ethanol administration and the composition of the diet. By administering ethanol in the drinking water, or as part of a low-fat (5% of energy) liquid diet, a significant induction of P450IIE1 and of the activities of the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system and p-nitrophenol hydroxylase was demonstrated in the absence of any significant increase in blood acetone with minimal increase in liver total lipids. Induction of P450IIE1 was comparable with the low or normal fat-containing diets, but MEOS activity rose more with the latter, possibly reflecting a potentiating effect of dietary fat on ethanol oxidation by P-450 enzymes other than P450IIE1. When the lack of weight gain of the alcohol fed animals was mimicked in controls by decreasing the amount of diet ingested, no induction was observed. Varying the pattern of liquid diet feeding had no demonstrable differential effect. Thus, the induction of P450IIE1 after chronic ethanol consumption can be attributed to ethanol itself, but dietary fat can potentiate the induction of the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system and of p-nitrophenol hydroxylase.\r"

These enantiomers demonstrate differential serotonin antagonism with the levorotatory (-) enantiomer showing a selective antiserotonin profile. (+)- and (-)-3-MeO-Cyp each were evaluated in 5 dogs, at doses ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/kg i.v. 1 hr after establishing CFRs, which were quantified in terms of frequency (CFR/hour) and severity (average nadir of coronary blood flow). The frequency or severity of CFRs was not affected consistently by 10 or 25 micrograms/kg of (-)-3-MeO-Cyp; however, 50 micrograms/kg practically abolished CFRs. (+)-3-MeO-Cyp was significantly less potent; complete abolition of CFRs required 0.5 mg/kg of this enantiomer in three dogs, and partial abolition occurred in the other two. These differences between (+)- and (-)-3-MeO-Cyp correlated well with a 12-fold difference in potency for inhibition of canine platelet aggregation stimulated by serotonin and ADP. The IC50's of (-)- and (+)-3-MeO-Cyp vs. ADP plus serotonin-induced aggregation of canine platelet-rich plasma were 1.03 +/- 0.39 (mean +/- S.E.) and 12.92 +/- 4.28 microM, respectively. Thus, (-)-3-MeO-Cyp, a 5-HT2 antagonist devoid of anticholinergic activity and less antihistamine activity than either its enantiomer or parent drug, cyproheptadine, exerts dose-dependent antithrombotic effects in this canine model, providing further evidence that serotonin plays an important role in platelet aggregation and thrombosis.\r"

The biosynthesis of the [3H]inositol-trisphosphate was rapid and was detectable at 15-sec poststimulation. The biosynthesis of [3H]inositol-monophosphate was stereo-selective and specific and was inhibited specifically by receptor antagonists. In fura-2 loaded RBL-1 cells, LTD4 and LTE4 induced a transient intracellular Ca++ mobilization. Agonist-induced Ca++ mobilization was specific and stereo-selective and was inhibited by specific receptor antagonists. The most (greater than 85%) LTD4-induced immediate response of Ca++ mobilization was from intracellular sources, whereas a small amount (less than 15%) was derived from the extracellular milieu. Both components were stimulated by receptor agonists and inhibited by the receptor antagonists, suggesting that they were regulated by the LTD4 membrane receptors. In addition, the results also suggested that a guanine nucleotide binding protein, insensitive to islet activating protein from Bordetella pertussis (not Gi or Go), was involved in the signal transduction mechanisms for LTD4 receptors in RBL-1 cells. These results suggested that the plasma membrane enriched LTD4 receptor was coupled via an islet activating protein insensitive G protein to a phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C. Agonist binding to the receptor could activate phospholipase C and resulted in phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate could function as intracellular messengers that trigger or contribute to calcium mobilization in RBL-1 cells.\r"

Considerable deviation from expected (Mendelian) inheritance towards greater sharing of inherited parental haplotypes was observed in the sibships as a whole and when subdivided according to the serological status of the sibship's members. Further, there was no evidence that linkage was stronger in the seropositive concordant than in the other sibships. Linkage was also demonstrated between HLA and seropositivity even in sibships where not all members expressed clinical RA. These results, therefore, do not support the existence of genetic heterogeneity between seropositive and seronegative RA, a possibility previously suggested from population studies of antigen associations.\r"

In the group with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, the numbers of circulating Ig producing cells were within normal limits, and lower than those found in definite Henoch-Schonlein purpura for IgA secreting cells (t = 8.26, p less than 0.001) and IgM secreting cells (t = 2.78, p less than 0.01). The number of circulating IgA secreting cells discriminated between definite Henoch-Schonlein purpura and leukocytoclastic vasculitis with a diagnostic sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 90.9%. Four of the 5 patients with probable Henoch-Schonlein purpura also had an increased number of IgA secreting cells. Therefore, an increased number of circulating IgA secreting cells in a patient with hypersensitivity vasculitis without a collagen vascular disease supports the diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura.\r"

  ".W": "To avoid biases inherent in the study of referral patients seen at a single unit, we investigated a group of 1500 patients (males 71%), members of the UK National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society (NASS). Patients were divided into 15 cohorts by year of onset (mean size 91). The median delay in diagnosis for these cohorts was greater than 6 years until 1974. Thereafter, there was a marked improvement with the most recent cohort waiting a median of 2 years for diagnosis (e.g., 1969/72 cohorts vs 1979/82 cohorts; mean delay 7.4 years vs 2.3 years, p less than 0.0001). Until 1974 the median delay for women was 9 years compared to 6 years for men (e.g., 1956/62 cohorts 11 and 7 years, p less than 0.0015, falling to 3 and 2.5 years, respectively by 1979/82, p = NS). Major differences were seen when the 14 health regions were taken separately; the median delay ranged from 9 years for the 3 \"worst\" regions to 4 years for the 3 \"best\" (p = 0.022). This was reflected in the percentage with delay in diagnosis longer than 2 years (80 and 58%, respectively; chi 2 = 11.31, p less than 0.01). Strikingly, the median age of onset of symptoms steadily increased from 18 years in 1930/40 to 28 years in 1981/82 (e.g., 1956/62 vs 1969/72; mean ages 21.4 vs 23.5 years, p less than 0.004 and 1969/72 vs 1979/82; 23.5 years vs 28.7 years p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most had either bilateral upper and lower extremity or bilateral upper extremity paresthesias. None had concurrent diseases commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy. Thirty-six patients with paresthesias had electromyograms performed before the diagnosis of fibromyalgia and 32 were normal. At a second assessment performed at a mean of 25 months from time of diagnosis, 56 of these 57 patients reported current paresthesias. Paresthesias are common in fibromyalgia and may mimic a neurologic disorder, although objective abnormalities are rare. Judicious use of neurodiagnostic tests are therefore indicated in the clinical setting of fibromyalgia.\r"

The results showed that the students introduced themselves to patients using methods that the authors grouped by levels of forthrightness. Those students who introduced themselves as medical students differed in their views on selected informed consent issues from students who introduced themselves as physicians. In general, all the students were less forthright about their status when given the opportunity to perform invasive procedures. Student gender, type of patient, and type of hospital were statistically associated with the students' behavior, according to bivariate analysis. After multivariate regression analysis, however, only the actions of the students' role models (residents and attending physicians) remained significantly associated with the students' behavior. The authors conclude that because some aspects of student behavior are at odds with the requirements of informed consent, medical educators must scrutinize the ethical dimensions of the policies they establish.\r"

The questionnaire was administered to fourth-year-medical students a short time before residency match day. Both the attitude and social support scales had excellent psychometric characteristics. The usefulness of these scales in discriminating between career choices of family practice and other clinical careers was tested. The social support scale did not discriminate well, whereas the attitude scale discriminated quite well. The students who chose careers in family practice differed from students who chose other careers in 14 of 19 values about characteristics of family practice but differed from them in only two of 19 beliefs about family practice. The implications for advising medical students about careers in family practice are discussed.\r"

To comply with the mandate, the PPCC was reorganized in 1984 as a faculty-operated prepaid group practice independent of the hospital. The new PPCC contracted with an HMO to provide care, with reimbursement based on capitation. The PPCC continues to serve the same patient population as before the reorganization, continues its teaching activities, and no longer has financial deficits. The experience at this clinic shows that converting to a faculty prepaid group practice can be cost-effective, promote efficiency, and improve faculty-hospital relations. Such a group practice is an appropriate organization for maintaining medical education programs while providing care in a capitation payment system.\r"

The most creative step for both groups is the ability to make an association between some external stimulus or situation and concepts stored in memory. Medical education must put more emphasis on teaching that improves students' abilities to make these associations. Two teaching methods that can promote development of the necessary association skills in clinical contexts--\"wait time\" and \"concept mapping\"--are briefly reviewed. Concept mapping consists of connecting words that represent concepts with lines that represent relationships and then labeling the lines. Wait time is waiting three to five seconds between asking a group of students a question and calling on a student to answer or waiting three to five seconds before responding to the student's answer.\r"

The residents recorded a little over half of all medical history information observed on the videotapes. Medical issues were more often documented than psychosocial or health behaviors. The residents in their second postgraduate year had the best documentation practices regardless of their residency track (primary-care or traditional track). Also, no difference was noted between the performances of primary-care internal medicine residents and traditional internal medicine residents. For one-quarter of the patients, less than 40 percent of the information that was present on the videotapes was documented in their charts. The residents documented more-severe illnesses better than less-severe ones and documented the medical histories of older patients better than the histories of younger ones. The residents' records of health behavior and psychosocial concerns were less complete for women patients. To improve chart documentation, members of both the attending and the house staffs should review videotapes and corresponding medical records of clinical encounters to help them investigate factors causing inadequate chart-documentation.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which the murine fibrosarcoma clone PAK 17.15 induces platelet aggregation [tumor cell-induced platelet aggregation (TCIPA)] was studied because platelet activation by this clone is necessary for metastasis to the lungs. PAK 17.15 TCIPA was completely inhibited by ADP-clearing enzymes, such as apyrase, or a mixture of creatine phosphate and creatine phosphokinase. Thrombin and collagen were not involved in PAK 17.15 TCIPA. Further studies showed that ADP is most likely secreted from activated platelets and that membrane protein(s) on PAK 17.15 cells are responsible for platelet activation. Inasmuch as ADP-dependent platelet aggregation requires fibrinogen and can be inhibited by the Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) synthetic peptide, the effect of this peptide on PAK 17.15 TCIPA was studied. PAK 17.15 TCIPA was completely inhibited by the GRGDS peptide (0.4 mM) but not by a control peptide, Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser (0.8 mM). In addition, the GRGDS peptide inhibited adhesion of PAK 17.15 cells to immobilized fibronectin. As expected, the GRGDS peptide almost completely inhibited lung colonization by iv injected PAK 17.15 cells in C57BL/6 mice. Our results indicate that GRGDS may inhibit pulmonary metastases by interfering with TCIPA as well as with tumor cell adhesion to extra-cellular matrix components in the host.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular and nuclear DNA content was measured by flow cytometry and the fraction of binucleated cells by fluorescence microscopy in normal adult human livers, hepatocellular carcinomas, cirrhotic livers surrounding tumors, and in some benign liver conditions. In five normal livers about one-half of the hepatocytes were polyploid; the majority of these were binucleated tetraploids containing two diploid nuclei. Thus, polyploidization in human liver does not progress as far as, for example, in the rat, where 80%-90% of adult hepatocytes are polyploid, mostly with tetraploid or octoploid nuclei. In five human euploid hepatocellular carcinomas and one investigated case of focal nodular hyperplasia, the percentage of polyploid cells was significantly reduced. Four other carcinomas exhibited a prominent aneuploid (hypotetraploid) peak in addition to the diploid peak. An abnormally low fraction of binucleated cells was also indicated in these tumors. Liver tissue surrounding the tumors had a ploidy distribution similar to that of normal liver. The results suggest that, like in several models of experimental hepatocarcinogenesis, human hepatocellular tumor growth is associated with a decreased polyploidization tendency and a corresponding increase in diploid, divisional growth, which may give the tumors a growth advantage relative to the surrounding liver.\r"

We measured the responses elicited after x irradiation of cells from the normal rat cell line REF52 as well as two oncogene-transformed REF52 cell lines with E1a or E1a plus the mutated c-Harvey-ras T24 (HRAS1 T24) allele. The transformed cell lines differed substantially in the patterns of changes in protein synthesis seen immediately after DNA damage. In addition, we identified a specific subset of growth-regulated cellular polypeptides that are correlated with the observed increase in x-ray-induced cell killing in the transformed cell lines. One of these polypeptides was cyclin (proliferating-cell nuclear antigen), a cell-cycle-specific DNA polymerase delta auxiliary factor. Synthesis of this set of coregulated polypeptides was rapidly suppressed by x irradiation in normal REF52 cells only. The inability of x irradiation to induce suppression of protein synthesis in cells from the transformed cell lines correlated with the increased susceptibility to x-ray-induced cell killing. This finding suggests that the cellular processes that underlie regulation of DNA-damage-induced growth arrest at the level of replicative elongation plays a role in determining the survival of x-irradiated cells.\r"

There were 12 open fractures (28%), 66% of the closed fractures underwent BWIIN within the first 24 hours of injury, and 33 fractures (77%) had comminution of Winquist-Hansen Type II or greater, and either static or dynamic locking techniques were used in 38 (88%) of the cases. There were three intraoperative technical problems. The estimated blood loss and operative times were consistent with other reported series for interlocking nailing techniques. The average followup was 65 weeks. Only one fracture went on to nonunion. There were no problems with angulation or rotation. One patient had 1.5 cm of shortening. There were four major (9%) and four minor (9%) complications. Rod removal was successful in 17 of 18 cases. Mechanical failure (deformation and/or fracture) of the proximal end of the rod was found in four (22%) of the extracted nails and caused failure of removal in one. The Brooker-Wills nail is a versatile device which can be used to treat complex fractures of the entire femoral shaft in acutely injured patients.\r"

  ".U": "89037242\r", 
  ".W": "Cerebral and systemic metabolism of oxygen, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and amino acids were studied in 27 comatose patients during the first 7 days after a head injury. Systemic oxygen consumption was elevated initially and gradually returned toward normal over the week of study. In contrast, cerebral oxygen consumption was depressed and decreased further over the week of study. Cardiac output and cerebral blood flow were increased with respect to systemic and cerebral metabolic requirements, and remained elevated for the entire week of study. Systemic hyperglycemia and lactic acidosis were present. The injured brain often made a sizeable contribution to the lactic acidosis. The arterial concentrations of pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were low. The early postinjury arterial amino acid profile was typically an increased level of alanine, taurine, glutamic acid, and a reduced concentration of valine, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, serine, ornithine, and arginine. At 3-4 days postinjury, as the early abnormalities were returning toward normal, glutamine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and methionine became elevated. These late increases in amino acids occurred at the time of the peak in plasma catecholamine concentrations. The net cerebral flux of amino acids followed the same general pattern of evolution over time as did the arterial concentration of amino acids. On days when the availability of the individual amino acid was increased, the net cerebral flux tended to be positive; when the availability was decreased, the net cerebral flux was zero or there was a net efflux of the amino acid. There was a significant linear relationship between the arterial concentration and the net flux of 13 of the 17 amino acids studied. Unlike the fasting state in normal man, in which beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate are important metabolic substrates, cerebral metabolism after head injury is almost totally dependent upon the aerobic and anaerobic metabolism of glucose. This is at least in part due to injury-induced limitations in the variety of substrates that are available for the brain to extract.\r"

One hundred seventy-three patients received either Mezlo or Clind/Gent combined therapy as assigned by computer-generated randomization. Of these, 147 patients were evaluable. Of 73 patients treated with Clind/Gent the mean duration of hospital stay was 8.9 +/- 4.0 days. Infectious complications developed in 18 patients of whom five failed to respond promptly, but only one required change in therapy. Of 74 patients treated with Mezlo, the mean duration of hospital stay was 9.1 +/- 5.0 days. Infectious complications occurred in 17, in whom four patients failed to eliminate their infections, and two needed changes in antibiotic therapy. None of the patients in either antibiotic group failed because of Enterococcus or Pseudomonas infections. There were no deaths. Twelve isolates of Bacteroides were found in peritoneal fluid cultures and all these patients had colon injuries. The overall therapeutic response was excellent to good in 94% on Clind/Gent and 93% on Mezlo. Azotemia developed in one patient on Clind/Genet and one on Mezlo but no other adverse reactions occurred. The differences shown between the two groups were not statistically significant. We conclude that a single drug mezlocillin is as safe and as effective in the treatment of abdominal trauma as combined clindamycin and gentamicin.\r"

The present experiments were undertaken to determine whether exogenously applied electric fields can induce regenerative responses in the damaged mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In these studies, chronically delivered direct current was applied to the optic nerve, orienting the cathode distal to the lesion site. Histologic analyses at 3 weeks revealed that the damaged optic nerve did exhibit a regenerative response following treatment. We believe that this represents the first report of regenerative effects on the mammalian visual system using chronic DC electric fields, and we suggest that such galvanic treatment may be used alone or as an adjunct to promoting regeneration of the injured mammalian central nervous system.\r"

We found that the Wagner apparatus was a simple, easy device for obtaining initial fracture stabilization in contaminated Type III-B and Type III-C open fractures. It does, however, require substantial postoperative care; four cases required secondary intramedullary fixation. We found a high infection rate with secondary reamed intramedullary nailing after initial stabilization with the external fixator.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the utility of a routine pelvic X-ray in resuscitation of blunt trauma patients, 669 patients were studied prospectively over a 2-year period. One hundred twelve patients (16.7%) had positive pelvic X-rays (PPX). When compared with the negative pelvic X-ray group (NPX), the PPX group had a significantly higher mean Injury Severity Score, 24-hour mean requirement for blood and component therapy, and higher incidence of associated injury of chest and abdomen. Despite the higher injury parameters, the mortality between the groups was not significantly different. When compared with five standard resuscitative assessment variables, a pelvic X-ray performed as an additional predictor of injury severity and 24-hour blood requirement. A pelvic X-ray should be performed routinely in victims of blunt trauma as part of the early resuscitation X-ray protocol since a positive finding has immediate prognostic and therapeutic implications.\r"

The data do not support findings from other studies that boys outnumber girls as victims. Previous reports that immersion burns constitute the major burn type are also contradicted by the present study and results are examined in terms of sampling techniques. A disproportionate number of alleged abusers in this study are female, a finding which is discussed relative to the average age of the victim and the events reported as precipitating abuse. This study indicates that burn abuse is most common in families of two or more children, and that the youngest child is at highest risk.\r"

Of the boys 25 per cent presented when they were less than 3 months old and the youngest tended to have the most severe reflux. Presentation was usually with urinary tract infection but 14 per cent had dysfunctional voiding symptoms without urinary tract infection. Based upon their presentation and initial evaluation the patients were allocated to 1 of 3 treatment protocols: observation, chemoprophylaxis or surgery. No renal parenchymal loss was detected in the boys on observation. Surgical therapy was free of serious complications. Over-all, this modified approach to the management of reflux in boys is acceptable although further followup will be required to confirm these initial conclusions.\r"

A total of 42 conjoint ureteral reimplantations was performed but in 8 cases only the lower pole ureter with reflux was reimplanted after it was separated from the nonrefluxing ureter. Ipsilateral ureteroureterostomy was performed in 19 cases of lower pole reflux. Two patients underwent lower pole heminephrectomy. Satisfactory results were obtained by all 3 reconstructive techniques. However, for lower pole reflux we recommend ipsilateral ureteroureterostomy unless a contralateral operation also is necessary. Ureteroureterostomy proved to be a simple and safe operation free of complications, with little morbidity and requiring a shorter hospitalization.\r"

The lowest normal value for maximal concentrating capacity and the highest normal value for fractional excretion of magnesium were set at 800 mOsm. per kg. and 8 per cent, respectively. Concentrating capacity was abnormal in all 22 renal units and the excretion of magnesium was abnormal in 5. Failure of a renal unit to retain magnesium normally was always associated with an inability to concentrate urine. We conclude that in cases of vesicoureteral reflux function of the distal part of the nephron is the first to become abnormal and concentrating capacity is a more sensitive indication of dysfunction than fractional excretion of magnesium.\r"

About three-fourths of the small kidneys remained small from the first examination through followup. Catch-up renal growth was only exceptional. New scars or progression of previous scarring was observed in 7.4 and 30 per cent of the primary and secondary groups, respectively. Factors that promote formation of new scars are high grade vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary tract infections and abnormal bladder function that results in high pressure reflux.

An early antireflux operation should be performed on children with severe reflux or recurrent urinary tract infections.\r"

Only those who underwent an operation for primary vesicoureteral reflux were included. Of the women 30 had been pregnant with 64 total pregnancies. During pregnancy 17 of the 30 women (57 per cent) had 1 or more urinary tract infections and 5 (17 per cent) had 1 or more episodes of pyelonephritis. There were 8 spontaneous abortions and 1 severe ureteral obstruction requiring cutaneous drainage until after delivery. There appears to be an increased risk of urinary infection and fetal loss in pregnant women who have undergone ureteral reimplantation as children. More frequent urinary screening and aggressive therapy during pregnancy are recommended in this high risk group.\r"

All 6 patients are alive without evidence of disease at a mean followup of 75 months (range 12 to 180 months). All 6 patients had deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploid tumors.

To examine this relationship further a rat model was developed. The rat testis normally descends postnatally on or about day 21. In this study newborn male rats underwent surgical excision of all anterior abdominal musculature from the umbilicus to the xiphoid, while a control group had a sham procedure. In both groups steel wire was inserted into both testes as radiological markers to monitor descent. Animals were explored on day 28 to confirm the position of the testes. A total of 36 animals survived all sections of the protocol. Eight animals had adhesions and were dropped from the study. The results of 17 rats in the experimental group and 11 in the control group revealed that the surgically created abdominal wall defect did not result in cryptorchidism. This finding suggests that an intact anterior abdominal wall is not a prerequisite for testicular descent in the rat.\r"

Diagnosis in these 13 patients included cloacal exstrophy (5), myelodysplasia (4), posterior urethral valves (2), radiation cystitis (1) and neurogenic bladder secondary to a rectal pull-through procedure (1). Indications for the use of stomach in bladder reconstruction were decreased renal function and acidosis (6 patients), insufficient large and small bowel (6) and decreased mucus production (1). Postoperative followup averaged 13 months (range 6 to 23 months). All patients have stable upper tracts radiographically and stable or improved renal function. Of 13 patients 10 require intermittent clean catheterization to empty and 11 are completely continent. Nine patients have remained free of infection, while 4 had asymptomatic bacteriuria. Mucus production is reduced relative to other intestinal segments and 10 patients require no bladder irrigations. Postoperative urodynamic evaluation is similar to that of ileocystoplasty or colocystoplasty. Use of stomach has protected these patients from the development of new or worsened hyperchloremic acidosis. Serum chloride values have decreased and serum total carbon dioxide values have increased after bladder reconstruction, particularly in patients with impaired renal function. Stomach should be considered when lower urinary tract reconstruction is necessary in such compromised patients.\r"

In an attempt to establish a guideline to determine when renal function is too poor in infancy to rely on diuretic renography for an accurate diagnosis we analyzed the slope of the diuretic renographic washout curve of the normal, nonaffected kidney in 33 infants with unilateral hydronephrosis. When the T 1/2 time in the normal, nonaffected kidney was greater than 9 minutes, as occurred in 68 per cent of the infants less than 1 month old, it defined a significant renal functional impairment in both kidneys that interfered with diuretic renographic test interpretation. With time renal function improved and after 4 months of age the T 1/2 time in all nonaffected kidneys became normal and the diuretic renographic diagnosis of obstruction became accurate. Our study indicates that nonaffected kidney T 1/2 time provides a qualitative assessment of global renal function in infancy and defines a level of renal functional maturity that must be achieved to ensure diuretic renographic test accuracy.\r"

  ".U": "89037408\r", 
  ".W": "Renal scintigraphy represents the optimal modality for the detection of renal scars. 99mTechnetium-glucoheptonate is rapidly accumulated by the kidney through glomerular filtration and active transport by renal tubular cells. This permits rapid visualization of the renal parenchyma in the early phase (1 to 3-minute images) and subsequent imaging of the collecting system and ureters. About 10 to 15 per cent of the injected activity remains in the kidney, labeling the cells of the proximal convoluted tubules (late phase or 1 to 2-hour images). The late phase has been used more commonly to assess renal parenchymal damage. Early and late phase glucoheptonate scanning was performed in 42 children as part of the evaluation of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections with or without a history of vesicoureteral reflux. Inter-observer reliability to interpret glucoheptonate scans was good (early, 83 per cent agreement and late, 93 per cent agreement). The ability of glucoheptonate scanning to detect renal scarring in children with febrile urinary tract infections was equivalent with the early or late phase of the study. In 6 patients renal scarring was detected on only the early phase scan and in 7 scarring was detected only in the late phase. Although the detection rates are equivalent the over-all detection of scarring is improved by using both phases. Therefore, the early phase of the glucoheptonate scan may be a valuable adjunct to conventional glucoheptonate scan methodology used for the detection of renal scarring in children with recurrent urinary tract infections.\r"

The induction of these proteins by testosterone is blocked by cycloheximide and, thus, requires new protein synthesis. These proteins activate phospholipase A2 stoichiometrically. They are inactivated by boiling, trypsin or alkaline phosphatase but not by deoxyribonuclease or ribonuclease. Lipokinins significantly repair the failure of masculinization in the Tfm mouse with an X-linked deficiency of androgen-receptor. Thus, the post-receptor effects of testosterone on embryonic genitalia may be mediated through stimulation of phospholipase A2 by lipokinins. Moreover, lipokinins may be involved as stimulators of the arachidonic acid cascade, as lipocortins are inhibitors.\r"

Another boy was examined under anesthesia and the operation was canceled because the testis could be brought into the scrotum. Subsequently, on followup evaluation 2 to 8 years later the ipsilateral testis could not be manipulated into the scrotum. Of the boys 6 then were treated with a short course of human chorionic gonadotropin. Four patients had a positive response but in 3 the testis was undescended again at examination 6 months later. Of the boys 6 ultimately underwent orchiopexy. Boys with highly retractile testes require periodic examination until puberty to ensure that those testes do not ascend secondarily.\r"

In 34 of 82 animals proximal transection of the gubernaculum resulted in descent of the testis. In 18 animals the testis remained in the abdomen but in both groups the processus vaginalis developed, suggesting that failure of descent was accidental and not caused by scrotal maldevelopment. Distal transection resulted in failure of descent and prevented growth of the processus vaginalis in all 27 rats. These results suggest that distal transection of the gubernaculum is equivalent to division of the genitofemoral nerve, which supplies the gubernaculum through its distal attachment. Because denervation of the gubernaculum prevents the effect of androgens on gubernacular differentiation, the results suggest that testosterone acts via the nerve. The putative effect of androgens on the gubernaculum may be mediated indirectly by the central nervous system, rather than directly on the gubernaculum itself.\r"

  ".W": "The 12-year experience at our hospital with epispadias and incontinence is reviewed and attention is focused on the approach to patients with a small bladder capacity. Of 29 children 20 had incontinence associated with the epispadias (13 boys and 7 girls). A total of 15 patients underwent definitive management of the incontinence with a Young-Dees bladder neck reconstruction with or without ureteral reimplantation and they are evaluable. Nine patients (6 boys and 3 girls) had a bladder capacity that was believed to be inadequate for satisfactory bladder neck reconstruction (less than 60 ml.). To date, 7 of these children have undergone staged reconstruction with urethroplasty for epispadias as the initial operation. Bladder capacity increased 95 ml. on the average (range 60 to 140 ml.) after the urethroplasty. No child had hydronephrosis before or after bladder neck reconstruction. Review of the results of bladder neck reconstruction in all patients with a mean followup of 2.9 years (range 7 months to 13 years) demonstrates an 87 per cent satisfactory continence rate (9 of 9 boys and 4 of 6 girls). In the patients who underwent staged reconstruction the results were similar, with a 100 per cent continence rate in evaluable patients (5 of 5 boys and 2 of 2 girls). In conclusion, urethroplasty before bladder neck reconstruction in the epispadiac child with a small bladder allows an increase in capacity, thus, obviating for the most part the need for procedures such as bladder augmentation in the majority of these patients.\r"

We used the AS800 device in 16 patients with exstrophy and epispadias, 13 of whom had undergone a prior bladder neck operation.

Renal damage was defined as the development of a renal scar or a persistent elevation in serum creatinine. Of the patients 72 have completed the bladder reconstruction; 51 (71 per cent) are continent and renal damage occurred in 10 (13 per cent) of the reconstructed patients. Median followup was 12.7 years. In a comparable group of 23 exstrophy patients managed by urinary diversion the occurrence of renal damage was notably higher: 82 per cent for ileal conduits, 22 per cent for nonrefluxing colonic conduits and 33 per cent for ureterosigmoidostomy. Based on these results we believe that staged reconstruction of the patient with classical bladder exstrophy offers a low risk for renal injury, an excellent chance for urinary continence and a more acceptable cosmetic appearance.\r"

Immediate colostomy is necessary. However, after colostomy the urinary tract assumes prime importance because of life-threatening obstruction and/or reflux. I treated 72 patients with complex cloacal malformations, 33 as primary and 39 as secondary cases. In 40 patients there was severe reflux with severe upper tract damage in more than half of the cases: 19 had prior urinary diversions (4 ileal loop, 5 loop ureterostomy and 10 vesicostomy). In nearly all secondary cases a definitive rectal operation had been done but the more life-threatening urinary tract had not been repaired. Some patients had other urological and nonurological malformations. Review of these cases emphasizes several points. Each case should be evaluated early endoscopically and radiographically to guide immediate and later treatment. Rectal reconstruction (now done via the posterior sagittal approach) should not be done as the initial procedure, which often was practiced in the past. In some patients the urinary tract should be repaired first when there is obstruction or massive reflux to prevent upper tract deterioration. In most cases it is feasible to repair all aspects of the anomaly in a single operation, that is the urinary tract, genital tract and rectum. With a well planned and coordinated approach to all 3 organ systems a satisfactory outcome is possible in most cases.\r"

In group 1 (50 patients) a traditional closed urinary drainage system was used, while in group 2 (50 patients) an open drainage system into doubled diapers was used. No significant difference in occurrence of urinary tract infections could be identified. Urinary infections occurred equally (24 per cent) in each group regardless of whether antibiotics were used postoperatively.

Manipulative therapy (dilation and direct vision internal urethrotomy) was successful in 55 per cent of the early strictures but in only 16 per cent of the late strictures. An open operation was performed primarily in some cases or after failed manipulation in others and it was successful in 79 per cent. All 4 failures of open procedures were salvaged with manipulative therapy. We conclude that treatment of post-hypospadias repair urethral strictures initially should be manipulative. Open repair usually will be successful but should be reserved for difficult strictures, late strictures or failures of manipulation.\r"

We used bladder mucosa in 13 boys to create 15 neourethras when there was inadequate preputial skin to perform a vascularized pedicle flap or a free preputial graft. In 3 cases a bladder mucosa graft was used for initial repair of the hypospadias. All other boys had undergone prior hypospadias surgery. In 4 boys the initial result was satisfactory. Seven minor complications occurred in 5 boys, while 4 had more major complications. In 2 boys severe problems with stricture necessitated graft replacement and a satisfactory outcome has not been achieved. Our problems with stricture and stenosis seem to be related to the use of a subcutaneous tunnel for the graft bed and coring of the glans to create the meatus. Over-all, in 11 of the 13 boys the bladder mucosal graft provided an excellent resolution of the complex problem with easily managed postoperative complications.\r"

There are many clinical, radiological and urodynamic factors that are widely available and that may aid in predicting which patients are at risk of renal injury. This study aims at achieving an objective statistical analysis of these multiple risk factors. We have applied this statistical analysis in a prospective manner to 215 patients with myelodysplasia and neurogenic bladder impairment. Potential risk factors in the lower urinary tract include bladder capacity, contractility and dyssynergia. Each of these factors was assigned a numerical score of 0 to 3, which was correlated with the presence of vesicoureteral reflux. The upper urinary tracts in these patients were assigned a numerical score according to the degree of radiological changes observed. These results then were tested with a stepwise regression analysis using p equals 0.05 as the significance level. In this analysis significant determinants of vesicoureteral reflux included a change in bladder shape, the presence of uninhibited contractions and the presence of dyssynergia. Renal deterioration was noted, and it was predicted by the presence of vesicoureteral reflux, a high ureteral pressure profile and dyssynergia. We conclude from this clinical study that risk of renal injury is present in these children. We also conclude that the risk can be predicted by urodynamic and radiological criteria and that these data can be correlated and analyzed using statistical methodologies.\r"

In contrast, of 11 older children with abnormal preoperative evaluations 3 (27 per cent) reverted to normal postoperatively.

  ".W": "There is healthy debate over the management and timing of surgical reconstruction in the neonate with hydronephrosis. We have seen 23 neonates (35 renal units) with antenatal or neonatal hydronephrosis secondary to ureteropelvic junction obstruction or megaureter since 1984. All renal units with postnatally confirmed hydronephrosis (78 per cent) were studied initially and serially with diuretic 99mtechnetium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renography and entered into a delayed management protocol. A total of 23 renal units followed for an average of 7 months before any surgical procedures were done demonstrated maturation of renal function. Of these cases 9 obstructed renal units (half-time greater than 20 minutes) underwent delayed reconstruction (6 with ureteropelvic junction obstruction and 3 with megaureter) at an average patient age of 6 months. In this group there was no compromise in renal function nor were any complications encountered. Two units with initially obstructive patterns on renography demonstrated improved drainage and have not required an operation to date. Twelve renal units with indeterminant (half-time 10 to 20 minutes) and nonobstructive (half-time less than 10 minutes) half-times also showed stable, maturing renal function. Delayed reconstruction in the neonate with ureteropelvic junction or megaureter obstruction and normal diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid function is safe. In addition, a period of observation may obviate the need for an operation in some cases when ureteropelvic junction stabilization results in improved drainage. These as well as the added benefits of diminished anesthetic risk, enhanced technical ease, noninterrupted maternal-infant bonding and lower operative complication rate make this approach desirable in properly selected patients.\r"

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was one of the most common histological findings in these obstructed kidneys but it almost always was found in association with intense interstitial and periglomerular inflammation.

A need exists for a simple technique to restore competence to the diseased valves at multiple sites in the venous system. The Venocuff is an implantable device developed to restore venous valve competence by reducing the vein circumference. Two animal models are described that are useful in the study of venous valve incompetence; the device was tested in these two models in the jugular vein of sheep. The first model was of naturally incompetent valves. The device was implanted around 11 completely incompetent and seven partially incompetent valves in 18 veins of 11 sheep. After implantation competence was restored or improved in all valves. The second model made use of an arteriovenous fistula to produce incompetence in the jugular vein in four sheep. The implant increased the pressure difference across the valve from 16 to 68 mm Hg. The Venocuff implant was thus effective at restoring valvular competence in the two animal models studied. There is evidence that valvular incompetence in these models and the results observed may be applicable in some cases of chronic venous disease in humans.\r"

Thirty-seven patients (23 men) had various distal deep femoral revascularizations for limb salvage indications only (rest pain, ischemic ulcers, and/or gangrene). Techniques to expose the distal deep femoral artery directly are described and their uses discussed. We found that the type of bypass performed (e.g., axillofemoral or aortofemoral) determined the patency rate of the reconstruction.

  ".W": "A short-term canine model of lower extremity venous hypertension was created to study the hemodynamics of crossfemoral venous bypass grafts (CFB). Specifically, the hemodynamic effects of bypass conduit diameter and adjunctive arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) were investigated. Unilateral hind limb venous hypertension was produced by iliofemoral venous ligation in six groups of five greyhounds each. Group I had venous ligation alone. CFBs were constructed in the remaining five groups: group II, 3 mm bypass conduit alone; group III, 3 mm bypass plus sequential AVF; group IV, 3 mm bypass plus caudad AVF; group V, 3 mm bypass plus cephalad AVF; group VI, 6 mm bypass conduit alone. Venous hypertension was significantly reduced by CFB (group II, p less than 0.025; group VI, p less than 0.001); increasing the diameter of the bypass conduit from 3 to 6 mm produced significantly greater graft flow (p less than 0.05), while completely relieving venous hypertension. Addition of adjunctive AVFs significantly augmented graft flow (p less than 0.001) but tended to aggravate ipsilateral venous hypertension (group III, p less than 0.01; group IV increase, NSS; group V, p less than 0.001). During the 4 hours of pressure monitoring, venous hypertension diminished significantly (p less than 0.05) with the sequential AVF but not with the other AVF. We conclude that (1) AVFs may be required for adequate graft flow if a small-diameter (3 mm) bypass conduit is used to relieve venous hypertension; (2) adjunctive AVFs aggravate venous hypertension; (3) sequential AVFs seem to be the most hemodynamically efficacious; (4) AVFs may not be necessary if a large, isodiametric (6 mm) conduit is used.\r"

  ".W": "Internal carotid injuries in zone III near the base of the skull are technically the most challenging of the carotid injuries. Diagnostic angiography is important to evaluate the exact site and extent of injury and the presence or absence of prograde flow in the injured segment. Vascular repair in this area is highly dependent on the adequacy of surgical exposure. Previous approaches have emphasized displacement of the mandible either by subluxation or mandibulotomy. Problems related to mandibulotomy, such as intraoral contamination, infection, and nonunion, are potential complications of this approach to the high carotid artery. In addition, it does not give adequate exposure of the internal carotid artery at the critical area, near the base of the skull. Experience gained from the extended radical neck dissection exposing the internal carotid artery up to the skull base has demonstrated that a posterolateral anatomic approach can provide superior exposure of the high carotid artery with lower morbidity and shortened operative time. This surgical approach involves cutting the sternomastoid muscle close to the mastoid and dissecting all the tissues away from the surface of the mastoid. Dividing the posterior belly of the digastric and styloid group of muscles assists in exposure of the internal carotid artery. Rarely, dissection of the facial nerve and removal of the tail of parotid add additional access to this area. This article describes the stepwise anatomic approach to the internal carotid artery near the base of the skull.\r"

Good functional and anatomic outcome has been maintained for 5 and 9 years, respectively. According to the available literature on pathologic data, complete cyst excision without arterial reconstruction is often feasible. Our results, as well as those published by others, suggest that short- and long-term outcome is better after complete cyst removal without than that with arterial reconstruction. As most patients are generally young adults, cystic excision should be preferred to venous bypass whenever feasible and whenever the remaining arterial wall seems to be healthy and solid.\r"

Twenty-two patients (11 in both the placebo and clindamycin treatment groups) completed the trial and were assessable. The two groups did not differ as to age, sex, race, or the number of recurrent abscesses preceding the trial. In pretrial evaluations, no patient had hypogammaglobulinemia or abnormal neutrophil function. Sixty-four percent (7/11) of the placebo-treated patients had a recurrent abscess within three months of enrollment whereas 82% (9/11) of the patients treated with clindamycin were free of any infection during the three-month treatment period. Of the nine patients who responded to clindamycin treatment, six did not have a recurrent infection for at least nine months after discontinuing antibiotic therapy. All patients tolerated the regimen without side effects. We conclude that a three-month course of low-dose oral clindamycin is an effective, convenient, well-tolerated, and often durable approach to prevention of recurrent staphylococcal skin infections.\r"

To determine risk factors for carriage, throat cultures were taken from passengers arriving on four consecutive flights from Saudi Arabia to the United States. Pilgrims were more likely to be group A meningococcal carriers than were nonpilgrims (relative risk, 11.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.7 to 33.1). Smoking, crowding, and meningococcal vaccination were not significantly associated with group A carriage. Pilgrims complaining of recent fever or sore throat, however, were more likely to be group A carriers, consistent with previous reports linking carriage and disease to preceding viral infections. Serogrouping of invasive meningococcal isolates can be used to monitor for indigenous transmission of this unusual strain in the United States, and we recommend routine vaccination of pilgrims to prevent future outbreaks of meningococcal disease.\r"

A medical advisory panel consisting of practicing clinical representatives from nine medical specialty societies helped develop written criteria and standards for specific surgical and medical cases. Abstracted data were compared with computer algorithms created from the medical standards and criteria. Those cases failing the review criteria were reviewed by a physician peer review panel. The sampled medical records represented approximately 7% to 8% of the total hospital discharges. Less than 1% of the overall sampled cases were in noncompliance with stated standards. The highest rate of noncompliance was for cases of diabetic ketoacidosis. The most frequent noncompliance event was hysterectomy. Although comparisons are not available, the quality of care among selected cases, as measured by compliance with civilian physician specialty group-endorsed standards, appeared high.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-five homosexual men with generalized lymphadenopathy for at least three months (lymphadenopathy syndrome [LAS]), subsequently shown to be seropositive for antibody against human immunodeficiency virus, were enrolled in a prospective study in Atlanta in 1982 and 1983. As of Nov 30, 1987, twenty-two (29%) of the 75 were known to have developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) three to 60 months after enrollment and five to 69 months after onset of LAS. The six-year cumulative incidence of AIDS, by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, was 38%. The cumulative incidence in years 4, 5, and 6 (30%) was significantly higher than in years 1, 2, and 3 (11%), suggesting that the risk for AIDS increases after the third year of LAS and that many more study participants will eventually develop AIDS. A precipitous decline in the T-helper cell count frequently heralds the diagnosis of AIDS; this decrease appears to occur at different times after the onset of LAS in different persons. The four-year cumulative incidence of AIDS following observations of T-helper cell counts less than 200/mm3, 200 to 299/mm3, 300 to 399/mm3, and 400/mm3 or greater was 84%, 41%, 25%, and 18%, respectively; these data are important for determining prognosis in the individual patient as well as for determining the suitability of candidates and baseline data for drug trials.\r"

Advanced age, male gender, physical status, major surgery, emergency procedure, procedures performed in 1975 to 1979, intraoperative complications, narcotic techniques, and having one or two anesthetic drugs administered were associated with increased mortality, whereas duration of anesthesia, experience of the anesthesiologist, and inhalation techniques were not. Receiver-operator characteristic curves showed no increment in prediction of operative mortality greater than that for patient plus surgical factors when \"other\" or anesthetic factors were added. Patient and surgical risk factors were much more important in predicting seven-day mortality than the anesthesia factors we studied.\r"

Younger- (n = 891) and older-onset (n = 987) persons participating in baseline and follow-up examinations were included. Glycosylated hemoglobin was measured by microcolumn. Retinopathy was determined from stereoscopic fundus photographs. In the younger-onset group, comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of glycosylated hemoglobin, the relative risk for developing any diabetic retinopathy was 1.9; for proliferative retinopathy, 21.8; and for progression, 4.0. Among older-onset persons taking insulin, the corresponding relative risks were 1.9, 4.0, and 2.1. Among older-onset persons not taking insulin, relative risks were 4.0 for any retinopathy and 6.2 for progression. A positive relationship between incidence and progression of retinopathy and glycosylated hemoglobin remained after controlling for duration of diabetes, age, sex, and baseline retinopathy. These data suggest a strong and consistent relationship between hyperglycemia and incidence and progression of retinopathy.\r"

This article describes a 4-year-old girl congenitally infected with human immunodeficiency virus who developed a continuous cutaneous infection with VZV that persisted over a 14-month period until her death. Initial episodes of varicella and zoster were responsive to acyclovir treatment; however, subsequent recurrences necessitated administration of multiple courses of acyclovir. Lesions became markedly hyperkeratotic, slow healing, and persistent despite acyclovir therapy. Numerous attempts to isolate virus from the lesions yielded only one isolate late in the course of therapy. This virus clearly demonstrated acyclovir resistance in vitro. Bizarre manifestations of VZV infection could present both diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. Prolonged acyclovir treatment of highly immunocompromised patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and severe VZV may lead to the appearance of resistant virus.\r"
