A prospective controlled study using plethysmography was performed. Venous capacitance and outflow were measured at term, and at 1 week, 6 weeks and 3 months following delivery. Results show decreased venous capacitance and venous outflow at term pregnancy, no improvement 1 week after delivery, modest improvement at 6 weeks, and dramatic statistically significant improvement in both parameters by 3 months. The persistence of venous dysfunction for several weeks after delivery indicates that changes in venous function at term pregnancy are largely the result of factors other than pelvic venous compression by the gravid uterus.\r"

For this purpose vein segments 5 cm length, varying in diameter from 4 up to 10 mm by steps of 1 mm, were obtained. Our experience with Varivas is limited to 59 patients. Of 47 infants, 18 received a left, and 25 a right sided aortopulmonary shunt, 9 had bilateral aortopulmonary shunts, 2 right ventricle pulmonary conduits, 1 a pulmonary-pulmonary conduit, 3 interrupted aortic arch reconstructions and 4 a central aortopulmonary shunt, 1 with confluence reconstruction, 3 recidives of coarctation a patch repair. Among 11 adults 6 received coronary bypass and 6 others vascular reconstructions. In contrast to other artificial graft materials, the vein material offers easy manipulation similar to the daily routine of handling fresh vein material offers easy manipulation similar to the daily routine of handling fresh vein grafts in coronary surgery. The appropriate diameter sizes match better the infants anatomy, without the risk of kinking and/or anastomosis displacement. Peroperatively it was possible to confirm patency by electromagnetic flow measurement and the postoperative examinations were done by colour Doppler echocardiography. We had to reoperate upon 4 infants because of early thrombosis; on 1 infant for stenosis of the graft and on another 5 for late thrombosis. In an attempt to extend the indications for \"inoperable\" pulmonary hypoplasia/atresia we were not able to keep the shunt open in 4 infants.\r"

Sixty-three patients who underwent tricuspid annuloplasty were studied. Thirty-four patients received Kay-Boyd annuloplasty and 29 Carpentier-Edwards ring annuloplasty. A new classification of TR based on the direction and area of regurgitation flow on Doppler echocardiogram was applied preoperatively. In the Kay-Boyd group, 10 cases showed massive TR and 24 cases showed localized TR preoperatively. Localized TR was well controlled in all cases, but 8 of 9 cases of massive TR showed grade III residual TR. In the C-E group, 21 cases showed massive TR and 8 cases showed localized TR. All cases were well controlled postoperatively. We conclude that (1) although the Kay-Boyd method is acceptable for localized TR, the C-E method should be employed for massive TR; (2) analyzing the regurgitant pattern of TR by Doppler echocardiogram is useful in selecting an appropriate surgical technique.\r"

  ".W": "A new quantitative method for evaluating regurgitation (TR) is proposed in order to select the most suitable treatment for functional TR associated with acquired valvular heart disease. The regurgitant volume per beat (VTR) is calculated using two-dimensional color Doppler and continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographies. In a study of 48 patients, preoperative VTR showed a significant correlation with tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole, right atrial mean pressure and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to preoperative VTR: Group I, VTR less than 10 cc (no. 18); Group II, VTR = 10-20 cc (no. 18); Group III, VTR greater than or equal to 20 cc (no. 12). This classification correlated well with the intraoperative findings of TR. In all Group I patients, VTR decreased without any tricuspid valve repair. In Group II, 17 of 18 patients underwent tricuspid annuloplasty, and showed a decrease in VTR to below 10 cc after surgery. In Group III, 10 underwent tricuspid annuloplasty and 2 tricuspid valve replacement. Three of the 10 with tricuspid annuloplasty showed a significant degree of postoperative VTR (10-20 cc). These 3 patients as well as the 2 with tricuspid valve replacement showed a preoperative peak-to-peak pressure difference across the tricuspid valve during the ejection phase (RVsp-TAv) of less than or equal to 20 mmHg and tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole of greater than or equal to 50 mm. In conclusion, no tricuspid valve repair was required in Group I (TR I). For group II (TR II) patients, tricuspid annuloplasty was necessary and adequate for TR correction. For Group II (TR III) patients, a more substantial procedure like tricuspid valve replacement should be performed, especially when the preoperative RVsp-RAv is less than or equal to 20 mmHg and tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole is greater than or equal to 50 mm.\r"

No median sternotomy infections were recorded in Group A compared to 5 cases in Group B (0 out of 22 vs 5 out of 21 patients, p less than 0.05). Amongst the patients with wound infection, three developed sternal dehiscence and mediastinitis with one death.

The ratio of the pressure gradient across the arch to the right radial artery was used to evaluate the postoperative level of stenosis. The maximum ratio of the pressure gradient that could be tolerated after surgery was considered to be 0.15 from the operative results. Negative correlations were found between the distal arch outer diameter and postoperative pressure gradient ratio (r = 0.80), and the distal arch index and postoperative pressure gradient ratio (r = 0.80). These correlations proved that in order to obtain a postoperative pressure gradient ratio of 0.15 or less, a distal arch outer diameter of 3.9 mm or more and a distal arch index of 0.63 or more were necessary. Consequently, a distal arch outer diameter of 3.9 mm or a distal arch index of 0.63 is considered to indicate that aortic arch hypoplasia is in need of repair.\r"

Analysis of the fluxbalance required by reticulocytes to conserve volume and composition predicted the existence of previously unsuspected Na(+)-dependent Cl- entry mechanisms. Unlike mature RBCs, reticulocytes did not tend to return to their original state after brief perturbations. The model predicted hysteresis and drift in cell pH, volume, and ion contents after transient alterations in membrane permeability or medium composition; irreversible cell dehydration could thus occur by brief K+ permeabilization, transient medium acidification, or the replacement of external Na+ with an impermeant cation. Both the hysteresis and drift after perturbations were shown to depend on the pHi dependence of the K:Cl cotransport, a major reticulocyte transporter. This behavior suggested a novel mechanism for the generation of irreversibly sickled cells directly from reticulocytes, rather than in a stepwise, progressive manner from discocytes. Experimental tests of the model's predictions and the hypothesis are described in the following paper.\r"

  ".W": "To explore our hypothesis of a direct reticulocyte origin of irreversibly sickled cells (ISCs), we fractionated light, reticulocyte-rich, and discocyte-rich sickle anemia red cells on Stractan gradients, and examined the effects of deoxygenation-induced sickling, external Ca2+, acidification, and replacing external Na+ by impermeant N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMG+). Sickling permeabilized light reticulocyte-rich cells to cations (Na+, K+, and Ca2+) more than discocytes; without external Ca2+, Na+ influx matched K+ efflux, with stable cell volume; with Ca2+, many light, low hemoglobin (Hb) F reticulocytes dehydrated rapidly (preventable by quinine, a Ca2(+)-dependent K+ channel inhibitor). Acidification of oxygenated discocytes (high mean Hb F) and reticulocyte-rich fractions yielded denser, reticulocyte-enriched cells with lower Hb F (as in light reticulocyte or dense ISC-rich fractions). Light cells shrank when NMG+ replaced Na+, supporting predictions of a Na(+)-dependent volume control system. Demonstration of sickling-induced, Ca2(+)-dependent dehydration of Hb F-free reticulocytes, and conservation of acid-stimulated K:Cl cotransport among low Hb F, reticulocyte-enriched cells in discocyte fractions support the hypothesis. Ancillary new findings included heparin stimulation of sickling-induced Na+ and K+ permeabilizations, and Ca2+ inhibition of the Na+ leak.\r"

  ".U": "91086437\r", 
  ".W": "In the hydropenic kidney, volume efflux from descending vasa recta (DVR) occurs despite an intracapillary oncotic pressure that exceeds hydraulic pressure. That finding has been attributed to small solute gradients which may provide an additional osmotic driving force favoring water transport from DVR plasma to the papillary interstitium. To test this hypothesis, axial gradients of NaCl and urea in the papilla were eliminated by administration of furosemide and saline. DVR were then blocked with paraffin and microperfused at 10 nl/min with a buffer containing albumin, fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled dextran (FITC-Dx), 22Na, and NaCl in a concentration of 0 (hypotonic to the interstitium), 161 (isotonic) or 322 mM (hypertonic). Collectate was obtained from the perfused DVR by micropuncture and the collectate-to-perfusate ratios of FITC-Dx and 22Na were measured. A mathematical model was employed to determine DVR permeability (Ps) and reflection coefficient to NaCl (sigma NaCl). The rate of transport of water from the DVR lumen to the papillary interstitium was 2.8 +/- 0.3 (Nv = 22), -0.19 +/- 0.4 (Nv = 15), and -2.3 +/- 0.3 nl/min (Nv = 21) (mean +/- SE) when perfusate NaCl was 0, 161, or 322 mM, respectively (Nv = number of DVR perfused). The collectate-to-perfusate 22Na concentration ratios were 0.34 +/- 0.04, 0.36 +/- 0.04 and 0.37 +/- 0.03 for those groups, respectively. Based on these data, Ps is calculated to be 60.4 x 10(-5) +/- 4.0 x 10(-5) cm/s and sigma NaCl less than 0.05. The results of this study confirm that transcapillary NaCl concentrations gradients induce water movement across the wall of the DVR.\r"

Intraperitoneal doses of 15 micrograms triiodothyronine (T3)/100 g body wt per d caused an increase in caloric intake from 26.5 +/- 1.7 (mean +/- SEM) kcal/100 g per d to 38.1 +/- 1.5 kcal/100 g per d. Food intake, however, rose only after 4-6 d of treatment and was maximal by the 8th day. In contrast, total body basal oxygen consumption rose by 24 h and reached a maximum by 4 d. Since total urinary nitrogen excretion and hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA did not rise, gluconeogenesis from protein sources did not supply the needed substrate for the early increase in calorigenesis. Total body fat stores fell approximately 50% by the 6th day of treatment and could account for the entire increase in caloric expenditure during the initial period of T3 treatment. Total body lipogenesis increased within 1 d and reached a plateau 4-5 d after the start of T3 treatment. 15-19% of the increased caloric intake was channeled through lipogenesis, assuming glucose to be the sole substrate for lipogenesis. The metabolic cost of the increased lipogenesis, however, accounted for only 3-4% of the T3-induced increase in calorigenesis. These results suggest that fatty acids derived from adipose tissue are the primary source of substrate for thyroid hormone-induced calorigenesis and that the early increase in lipogenesis serves simply to maintain fat stores. Since the mRNAs coding for lipogenic enzymes rise many hours before oxygen consumption and lipolysis, these results suggest that T3 acts at least in part by an early coordinate induction of the genes responsible for these processes.\r"

Binding of 125I-ET-1 with its site was specific, saturable, and time dependent (kobs = 0.019 +/- 0.001 min-1), but dissociation of receptor-bound ligand was minimal. A single class of high affinity binding sites for 125I-ET-1 was identified with an apparent Kd of 32.4 +/- 9.8 pM and a Bmax of 1084 +/- 118 fmol/mg protein. ET-3 and big-ET-1 (1-38) (human) inhibited 125I-ET-1 binding with IC50 values of 1.85 +/- 1.03 nM and 43 +/- 6 nM, respectively. Aequorin measurements of cytosolic free Ca2+ in single, isolated rat hepatocytes showed that ET-1 at subnanomolar concentrations induced a series of repetitive, sustained Ca2+ transients. ET-1 had no effect on cAMP production. Finally, ET-1 caused a rapid and sustained stimulation of glycogenolysis in rat hepatocytes. A 1.8-fold maximal increase in glycogen phosphorylase alpha was observed at 1 pM ET-1, with an EC50 of 0.03 pM. Stimulation of the enzyme was specific for ET-1 since the order of potency of related peptides was similar to that in binding experiments (ET-1 greater than ET-3 greater than big ET-1). These data constitute the first demonstration of the presence of ET-1 binding sites in liver which is associated with a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ and a potent glycogenolytic effect. We conclude that ET-1 behaves as a typical Ca2+ mobilizing hormone in liver.\r"

Using piezoelectric crystals implanted midwall in the ischemic zone, end-diastolic length, end-systolic length, and percent segmental shortening were assessed. Expression of HSP 70 was measured by Northern blotting. A single 5-min coronary occlusion doubled the expression of HSP 70 whereas four cycles of 5 min of ischemia/5 min of reperfusion resulted in a threefold increase in HSP 70 mRNA (P less than 0.001). Measurements with the piezoelectric crystals showed mild myocardial dysfunction concomitant with the increase in HSP 70. This increase in HSP 70 mRNA after repetitive brief ischemia was transient, occurring as early as 1 h and returning to baseline by 24 h after ischemia. Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to HSP 70 was used to compare sham and postischemic myocardial HSP 70 levels. Changes in the amount of HSP 70 were evident as early as 2 h and were even more striking at 24 h.\r"

Since bleomycin induces pulmonary fibrosis in humans and animals, the effects of this drug on endothelial cells were examined. Endothelial cell conditioned media were prepared in the presence of various doses of bleomycin, and tested for their ability to stimulate lung fibroblast collagen synthesis. The results show a dose-dependent stimulation of endothelial cell secretion of collagen synthesis stimulatory activity by bleomycin, which peaked at a dose greater than or equal to 100 ng/ml. Stimulation was selective for collagenous protein synthesis. Gel filtration analysis showed most of the activity to reside in fractions with an estimated molecular mass range of 10-27 kD. The activity was inhibited by anti-transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)antibody, but not by nonimmune control IgG. The presence of TGF-beta was confirmed using the mink lung epithelial cell assay. Northern blotting revealed significant increases in TGF-beta mRNA in bleomycin-stimulated endothelial cells. Thus in vitro stimulation of endothelial cells by bleomycin upregulates TGF-beta production, presumably by increased transcription. In view of the chemotactic and matrix synthesis stimulatory properties of this cytokine, such an increase in TGF-beta production may play an important role in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

In lungs pretreated with meclofenamate (3 microM), the endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) and ionophore A23187 (10(-9)-10(-7) M) were examined during conditions of increased tone by U46619 (50 pmol/min). Acetylcholine or A23187 produced dose-dependent vasodilation in control lungs, this response was reduced in group 1W-H (P less than 0.02), abolished in group 3W-H (P less than 0.001), and restored in group 3WH + R. In contrast, the endothelium-independent vasodilator agent sodium nitroprusside remained fully active in group 3W-H. The pressor response to 300 pM endothelin was greater in group 3W-H than in controls (6.8 +/- 0.5 mmHg vs. 1.6 +/- 0.2 mmHg, P less than 0.001) but was not potentiated by the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) antagonists: hydroquinone (10(-4) M); methylene blue (10(-4) M); and pyrogallol (3 x 10(-5) M) as it was in controls. It was similar to controls in group 3W-H + R. Our results demonstrate that hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension is associated with a loss of EDRF activity in pulmonary vessels, with a rapid recovery on return to a normoxic environment.\r"

In this study both rat and human P. carinii proteins were purified by solubilization with zymolyase followed by molecular sieve and ion exchange chromatography. The native proteins had an apparent mol wt of 290,000 or greater, based on molecular sieve studies as well as cross-linking studies. Both proteins were glycoproteins; treatment with endoglycosidase H resulted in a 9% decrease in mol wt. The carbohydrate composition of the rat P. carinii glycoprotein was distinct from the human isolate; glucose, mannose, galactose, and glucosamine occurred in approximately equimolar ratios in the human P. carinii protein, whereas glucose and mannose were the predominant sugars of the rat P. carinii protein. To evaluate humoral immune responses to the human P. carinii protein, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified protein was developed. Some, but not all, patients who subsequently developed P. carinii pneumonia demonstrated a serum antibody response to the surface antigen. Nearly all subjects without a history of P. carinii pneumonia had no detectable antibodies. Purified P. carinii proteins will greatly facilitate the investigation of host-P. carinii interactions.\r"

These clones reacted with lupus patient sera which had anti-52-kD Ro/SSA antibodies, and with affinity-purified anti-52-kD Ro/SSA antibodies. Moreover, affinity-purified antibodies isolated from isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside-induced proteins of these clones reacted only with the 52-kD protein of lymphocytes in Western blots and precipitated Ro/SSA hY RNAs, confirming that the clones encode a 52-kD Ro/SSA antigen. The cDNA contains a single open reading frame of 1,425 nucleotides and encodes a predicted 475-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of 54,108 D. This protein appears unique in that both a zinc finger and leucine zipper motif are present on this protein. Surprisingly, no homology was found between the 52-kD Ro/SSA gene or protein and three published 60-kD Ro/SSA sequences. However, significant similarity of the 52-kD Ro/SSA was detected with human rfp and mouse rpt-1. These three proteins each contain similar zinc finger motifs in approximately their first 145 amino acid residues. The cDNA and the protein expressed therefrom are useful in the analysis of the structural and functional properties of this autoantigen.\r"

Results: Adipose tissue palmitate release was greater from forearm than whole body (5.97 +/- 0.75 vs. 3.84 +/- 0.34 mumol.kg fat-1.min-1, respectively, P less than 0.005, n = 22 subjects). Systemic palmitate release, relative to fat mass, was significantly (P less than 0.01) greater in nonobese than upper-body obese, and upper-body obese than lower-body obese women, and forearm adipose tissue palmitate release followed the same pattern. Hyperinsulinemia suppressed systemic and forearm lipolysis to similar degrees, however, hypoinsulinemia consistently increased systemic palmitate flux without increasing forearm palmitate release. These results confirm the heterogeneity of adipose tissue in an in vivo model and emphasize the need to consider which adipose tissue depots are responsible for the differences in systemic FFA flux in obese and nonobese humans.\r"

In this study, we observed that urate crystals, coated with apo E of monocyte origin, had a diminished ability to stimulate neutrophils. Apo E was also detected on the surface of urate crystals recovered from gout patients. Thus, we analyzed apo E in noninflammatory synovial fluid, and found it to be associated with particles of heterogeneous size and of predominantly alpha and pre-beta electrophoretic mobility. Local articular synthesis of at least a portion of synovial fluid apo E was suggested because (a) the synovial fluid/plasma concentration ratio of apo E was significantly higher than that for both apo B and apo A-I, which are not widely synthesized by extrahepatic tissues, (b) cultured rheumatoid synovial cells in first passage secreted apo E, (c) a portion of synovial fluid apo E was heavily sialylated. We conclude that synovial fluids contain apo E that appears partly of local origin. Apo E binds to urate crystals and could modulate gouty inflammation.\r"

Various phenotypes of MMA have been delineated including complete absence of enzyme activity (mut0) and abnormal enzyme activity with an elevated Km for adenosylcobalamin (mut-). We describe genetic studies on a cell line (WG1130) from a patient with mut0 MMA which exhibited an unusual complementation phenotype, complementing with three of nine mut0 cell lines and four of five mut- cell lines. This suggests that interallelic complementation occurs between mutant alleles in WG1130 and subsets of alleles associated with both mut0 and mut- phenotypes. The methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA was cloned from WG1130 and found to contain a G354----A (Arg93----His) mutation. Gene transfer of this mutant clone into primary fibroblasts from patients with MMA confirms that this mutation expresses a mut0 phenotype when transferred into a mut0 cell line with low levels of mRNA but can contribute to apoenzyme function when transferred into mut cell lines which show correction with WG1130 by somatic cell complementation. These results point to further heterogeneity within both mut0 and mut- and may enable identification of mutations affecting discrete components of apoenzyme function.\r"

Maximum cumulative levels of 8 +/- 0.6 and 9 +/- 1.0 U/ml, respectively, were reached after 8 h. In contrast, cumulative mBPA and sBPA levels in medium prepared from cells treated with metabolic inhibitors were reduced by up to 90%. Both surface exfoliation and mBPA expression by intact plasma membranes were diminished. Whereas pulse-exposure to cytosine arabinoside had no effect, treatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide abolished BPA expression. Exposure to monensin reduced mBPA and sBPA levels to zero in a concentration-and time-dependent fashion. We conclude that production and release of BPA is an energy-dependent process, requiring mRNA synthesis and translation and posttranslational remodeling of the protein but not replicative DNA synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have revealed a role for platelets and the platelet-adhesive proteins, fibronectin and von Willebrand factor (vWF) in platelet-tumor cell interaction in vitro and metastasis in vivo. The present report documents the effect of thrombin treatment of platelets on this interaction in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, thrombin at 100-1,000 mU/ml maximally stimulated the adhesion of six different tumor cell lines from three different species two- to fivefold. As little as 1-10 mU/ml was effective. The effect of thrombin was specific (inhibitable by hirudin, dansyl-arginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5 pentanediyl) amide and unreactive with the inactive thrombin analogue N-P-tosyl-L-phenylchloromethylketone-thrombin and D-phenylalanyl-L-propyl-L-arginine chloromethylketone-thrombin (PPACK-thrombin), and required high-affinity thrombin receptors (competition with PPACK-thrombin but not with N-P-tosyl-L-lysine-chloromethyl-ketone-thrombin). Functionally active thrombin was required on the platelet surface. Binding of tumor cells to thrombin-activated platelets was inhibitable by agents known to interfere with the platelet GPIIb-GPIIIa integrin: monoclonal antibody 10E5, tetrapeptide RGDS and gamma chain fibrinogen decapeptide LGGAKQAGDV, as well as polyclonal antibodies against the platelet adhesive ligands, fibronectin and vWF. In vivo, thrombin at 250-500 mU per animal increased murine pulmonary metastases fourfold with CT26 colon carcinoma cells and 68-413-fold with B16 amelanotic melanoma cells. Thus, thrombin amplifies tumor-platelet adhesion in vitro two- to fivefold via occupancy of high-affinity platelet thrombin receptors, and modulation of GPIIb-GPIIIa adhesion via an RGD-dependent mechanism. In vivo, thrombin enhances tumor metastases 4-413-fold with two different tumor cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "Our aim was to define mechanisms whereby conjugated estrogens (Premarin, exogenous estrogen; Ayerst Laboratories, New York) increase the risk of developing cholesterol gallstones and to determine the role, if any, of dietary cholesterol. We studied gallbladder motor function, biliary lipid composition and secretion, cholesterol absorption, cholesterol synthesis and esterification by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the clearance of chylomicron remnants, and bile acid kinetics in 29 anovulatory women. 13 were studied on both a low (443 +/- 119 mumol/d) and high (2,021 +/- 262 mumol/d) cholesterol diet. Premarin increased the lithogenic index of bile (P less than 0.05), increased biliary cholesterol secretion (P less than 0.005), lowered chenodeoxycholate (CDCA) pool (P less than 0.001) and synthesis (P less than 0.05), altered biliary bile acid composition [( CA + DCA]/CDCA increases, P less than 0.005), stimulated cholesterol esterification (P less than 0.03), and enhanced the clearance of chylomicron remnants (P = 0.07). Increases in dietary cholesterol stimulated the biliary secretion of cholesterol (P = 0.07), bile acid (P less than 0.05), phospholipid (P = 0.07), and as a result, did not alter lithogenic index. The reduction in CDCA pool and synthesis by Premarin was reversed by increasing dietary cholesterol. Off Premarin, only 24% of the increase in cholesterol entering the body in the diet was recovered as biliary cholesterol or newly synthesized bile acid. On Premarin, 68% of this increase in cholesterol was recovered as these biliary lipids. We conclude that Premarin increases biliary cholesterol by enhancing hepatic lipoprotein uptake and inhibiting bile acid synthesis. These actions of Premarin divert dietary cholesterol into bile.\r"

  ".U": "91086455\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the importance of the intact mitral subvalvular apparatus for left ventricular (LV) energetics, data from nine open-chest ejecting canine hearts were analyzed using piezoelectric crystals to measure LV volume. After mitral valve replacement with preservation of all chordae tendineae, baseline LV function was assessed during transient caval occlusion: A quadratic fit of the LV end-systolic pressure-volume data was used to determine the curvilinear end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR). All chordae were then divided with exteriorized snares. Reassessment revealed deterioration of global LV pump function: (a) the coefficient of nonlinearity, decreased (less negative) by 90% (P = 0.06); (b) slope of the curvilinear ESPVR at the volume axis intercept, decreased by 75% (P = 0.01); and V100, end-systolic volume at 100 mmHg end-systolic pressure, increased by 42% (P less than 0.02). Similarly, preload recruitable stroke work fell significantly (-14%) and Vw1,000 (end-diastolic volume [EDV] at stroke work [SW] of 1,000 mmHg.ml) rose by 17% (P less than 0.04). With respect to LV energetics, the total mechanical energy generated by the ventricle decreased, as indicated by a decline in the slope of the pressure volume area (PVA)-EDV relationship (120 +/- 13 [mean +/- SD] vs. 105 +/- 13 mmHg, P less than 0.001). Additionally, comparison of LV SW and PVA from single beats with matched EDV showed that the efficiency of converting mechanical energy to external work (SW/PVA) declined by 14% (0.65 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.08, P less than 0.03) after chordal division. While effective systemic arterial elastance, Ea, also fell significantly (P = 0.03) after the chordae were severed, the Ea/Ees ratio (Ees = slope of the linear ESPVR) increased by 124% (0.91 +/- 0.53 vs. 2.04 +/- 0.87, P = 0.001) due to a proportionally greater decline in Ees. This indicates a mismatch in ventriculo-arterial interaction, deviating from that required for maximal external output (viz., Ea/Ees = 1). These adverse effects of chordal division may be related to the observed changes in LV geometry (i.e., eccentricity). We conclude that the intact mitral subvalvular apparatus is important in optimizing LV energetics and ventriculo-vascular coupling in addition to the enhancement of LV systolic performance.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that a sustained rise in resting levels of cytosolic calcium [Ca2+]i of pancreatic islets is responsible for impaired insulin secretion in chronic renal failure (CRF). Evidence for such an event is lacking and the mechanisms through which it may affect insulin secretion are not known. Studies were conducted in normal, CRF, and normocalcemic, parathyroidectomized (PTX) CRF rats to answer these questions. Resting levels of [Ca2+]i of islets from CRF rats were higher (P less than 0.01) than in control of CRF-PTX rats. [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake and cAMP production by islets were not different in the three groups. Insulin content of, and glucose-induced insulin secretion by islets from CRF rats was lower (P less than 0.01) than in control and CRF-PTX rats. In contrast, glyceraldehyde-induced insulin release by CRF islets was normal. Basal ATP content, both glucose-stimulated ATP content and ATP/ADP ratio, net lactic acid output, Vmax of phosphofructokinase-1, and Ca2+ ATPase of islets from CRF rats were lower (P less than 0.02-less than 0.01) than in normal or CRF-PTX animals. Data show that: (a) Glucose but not glyceraldehyde-induced insulin secretion is impaired in CRF; (b) the impairment in glucose-induced insulin release in CRF is due to a defect in the metabolism of glucose; (c) this latter defect is due to reduced ATP content induced partly by high [Ca2+]i of islets; and (d) the high [Ca2+]i in islets of CRF rats is due to augmented PTH-induced calcium entry into cells and decreased calcium extrusion from the islets secondary to reduced activity of the Ca2+ ATPase.\r"

Understanding the mechanisms that modify the metabolic parameters in traumatized obese patients is essential in their nutritional assessment and further treatment. We have investigated in 7 obese and 10 nonobese multiple trauma patients, on a whole-body level, the energy metabolism, protein kinetics, and lipolysis in the early catabolic \"flow phase\" of severe injury when they were receiving maintenance fluids without calories or nitrogen. Traumatized obese patients mobilized relatively more protein and less fat compared with nonobese subjects. A relative block both in lipolysis and fat oxidation is experienced by injured obese patients that results in a shift to preferential use of proteins and carbohydrates. Reduced endogenous protein synthetic efficiency observed in obese patients implies increased protein recycling. Thus obese patients could not effectively use their most abundant fat fuel sources and have to depend on other fuel sources. The nutritional management of obese trauma victims should therefore be tailored towards provision of enough glucose calories to spare protein.\r"

Amplification with two or more primer sets from the gag, env, LTR occurred in 21 (91%) patients' T cells and 17 (74%) patients' monocytes. However, amplification with the LTR primers in monocytes was uncommon. Among four patients tested, amplified DNA continued to be detected after a greater than one thousand-fold dilution (less than 500 cells) of both T cell and monocyte lysates. Repeat analysis after 7-9 mo in five seropositives yielded similar findings in T cells and monocytes, but some variation in the efficacy of amplification with individual primers occurred. There was no difference in those 10 patients who were taking AZT, compared to those who were untreated. Our results indicate that a fraction (less than 1%) of both T cells and monocytes in blood carry a latent infection in all stages of HIV-1 disease and can serve as reservoirs throughout AZT therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91086459\r", 
  ".W": "The platelet fibrinogen receptor is composed of a complex of glycoproteins (GP) IIb and IIIa on the surface of platelets. Deficient function of this receptor prevents normal platelet aggregation, resulting in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT). In this paper, we describe a black thrombasthenic patient who is either homozygous or hemizygous for a deletion within the GPIIb gene. Initial Western blot analysis of platelet proteins from this patient did not detect any GPIIb, but did detect small amounts of GPIIIa of normal mobility. Quantitation of vitronectin receptor (VNR) demonstrated that this thrombasthenic patient had approximately 1.5-2 times the number of these receptors per platelet compared with controls, a finding that has previously been noted in other thrombasthenic patients with defects in GPIIb. Genomic Southern blot studies demonstrated a deletion in the GPIIb gene of approximately 4.5 kilobasepairs (kb). Analysis of the isolated GPIIb gene demonstrated that the deletion begins between two Alu repeats within intron 1 and ends in intron 9. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies using platelet RNA and oligonucleotides directed to both the 5' and 3' ends of the GPIIb cDNA sequence easily detected GPIIb transcript, suggesting that the genomic deletion of exons 2-9 does not significantly decrease the level of the GPIIb mRNA. Sequence analysis of PCR-generated GPIIb cDNA showed that a cryptic AG splice acceptor sequence was being utilized, resulting in a transcript that contained a portion of introns 1 and 9, as well as having a deletion of exons 2-9. Unlike the GPIIb gene, the GPIIIa gene appears to be intact by Southern blot analysis. PCR studies using platelet RNA and oligonucleotides directed to the GPIIIa cDNA sequence demonstrated the presence of GPIIIa mRNA. In summary, the thrombasthenic state in this patient appears to be due to a GPIIb gene deletion resulting in an abnormal transcript and no detectable platelet GPIIb. Platelet GPIIIa levels were secondarily low presumably due to the known instability of GPIIIa in the absence of GPIIb.\r"

  ".U": "91086460\r", 
  ".W": "Recent experimental work has identified a novel intracellular binding site for the synthetic progestin, Gestodene, that appears to be uniquely expressed in human breast cancer cells. Gestodene is shown here to inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion, but has no effect on endocrine-responsive human endometrial cancer cells. Gestodene induced a 90-fold increase in the secretion of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) by T47D human breast cancer cells. Other synthetic progestins had no effect, indicating that this induction is mediated by the novel Gestodene binding site and not by the conventional progesterone receptor. Furthermore, in four breast cancer cell lines, the extent of induction of TGF-beta correlated with intracellular levels of Gestodene binding site. No induction of TGF-beta was observed with the endometrial cancer line, HECl-B, which lacks the Gestodene binding site, but which expresses high levels of progesterone receptor. The inhibition of growth of T47D cells by Gestodene is partly reversible by a polyclonal antiserum to TGF-beta. These data indicate that the growth-inhibitory action of Gestodene may be mediated in part by an autocrine induction of TGF-beta.\r"

We studied the effects of IL-1 on phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) metabolism and confirmed reports indicating that IL-1 does not stimulate increased PtdIns turnover; however, we observed the accumulation of PtdIns-4-phosphate (PtdInsP) in response to IL-1. Using a fibroblast membrane preparation, we were able to detect stimulated PtdInsP accumulation within 10 s of IL-1 addition. Increased PtdInsP accumulation was due to stimulated PtdIns kinase activity, not the inhibition of PtdInsP hydrolysis by phospholipase(s). PtdIns kinase activity was magnesium dependent, increased as a function of IL-1 concentration, and specifically phosphorylated the D4 position of inositol. Stimulated PtdIns kinase activity could be detected at 10(-12) M IL-1 in fibroblast membranes, a concentration within the physiological range for IL-1 action; half-maximal activity was reached at approximately 10(-10) M IL-1. Heat denaturation of IL-1 or treatment of IL-1 with anti-IL-1 antibody abrogated the IL-1 effect. These findings demonstrate the direct, IL-1-mediated, stimulation of PtdIns kinase. IL-1-stimulated PtdIns kinase activity represents an important physiological regulatory effect by IL-1 as it could control the synthesis and/or maintenance of phosphorylated derivatives of PtdIns which comprise only a very small pool of substrates for the generation of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol.\r"

We report here that twice daily instillation of 30 mM glucose over 10 d in a rat skin chamber granulation tissue model induces approximately a 2.7-fold increase in diacylglycerol (DAG) levels (versus tissues exposed to 5 mM glucose) in association with marked increases in vascular clearance of albumin and blood flow. The glucose-induced increase in DAG levels as well as the vascular functional changes are prevented by addition of 3 mM pyruvate. Pharmacological activation of protein kinase C with the phorbol ester TPA in the presence of 5 mM glucose increases microvascular albumin clearance and blood flow, and similar effects are observed with 1-monoolein (MOG), a pharmacological inhibitor of the catabolism of endogenous DAG. A pharmacological inhibitor of protein kinase C (staurosporine) greatly attenuates the rise in microvascular albumin clearance (but not the rise in blood flow) induced by glucose or by MOG. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that elevated concentrations of glucose increase tissue DAG content via de novo synthesis, resulting in protein kinase C activation, and that these biochemical events are among the factors that generate the increased microvascular albumin clearance.\r"

We determined that (a) purified IgG from anti-PFR antiserum reacted with purified apo- and holo-PFR and specifically immunoprecipitated a single (44-kD) iodinated moiety on cell surfaces of low density mononuclear cells (LDMNC); (b) when retained in culture during in vitro hematopoiesis, anti-PFR IgG (in contrast to PFR-neutralized anti-PFR IgG and nonimmune IgG) consistently led to increased cloning efficiency of colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E), burst forming unit-E (BFU-E), CFU-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM), and CFU-GEM megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM), and objectively defined megaloblastic changes in orthochromatic normoblasts from CFU-E- and BFU-E-derived colonies; (c) when anti-PFR antiserum was removed after initial (less than 1 h) incubation with LDMNC, a cell proliferation response was induced, but megaloblastic changes were not evident. (d) Conversely, delay at 4 degrees C for 24 h before long-term plating with antiserum resulted in megaloblastosis without increased cell proliferation; (e) however, 500-fold molar excess extracellular folate concentrations completely abrogated the expected anti-PFR antiserum-induced megaloblastic changes, without altering cell proliferative responses. Thus, although cell proliferative and megaloblastic changes are induced after short-term and prolonged interaction of antibody with folate receptors on hematopoietic progenitors, respectively, they are independent effects.\r"

Placental trophoblasts were cocultured with decidual cells and trophoblasts or JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells were incubated with medium conditioned by decidual cells (DCM) for 72-96 h. In cocultures decidual cells inhibited choriogonadotropin (hCG) release from trophoblasts by 75% in comparison with controls (P less than 0.001). The DCM contained a factor that markedly inhibited hCG release from trophoblasts and JEG cells in vitro compared with controls. The inhibitory effect of the factor on hCG release was dose dependent, and could be eliminated by boiling the DCM for 30 min or proteolytic enzyme treatment. Ultrafiltration and Sephadex G-50 fractionation of the DCM indicated that the apparent molecular mass was 7,000-10,000 D. DCM also inhibited the stimulatory effect of exogenous cAMP on hCG secretion by JEG-3 cells, suggesting that DCM may interfere with activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinases or transcription of hCG genes. These results suggest that the release of trophoblast hCG is under local paracrine control, regulated in part by a protein released by decidual cells.\r"

Several pathways may be involved in that process. Tracer kinetics were used to estimate the contributions of the various pathways to cellular uptake of HDL CE in rabbits. Tracers of HDL CE, HDL apo A-I, LDL apo B, and VLDL CE were simultaneously injected intravenously. Plasma decays were followed for 24 h in 4 lipoprotein pools: HDL without apo E, HDL with apo E, LDL, and VLDL. Kinetic analysis of the resulting plasma decay curves revealed that the preponderance of plasma CE (greater than 90%) originated in the HDL fraction. About 70% of HDL CE were cleared from plasma after transfer to LDL and VLDL, 20% were cleared directly from the HDL pool without HDL particle uptake (\"selective\" uptake), and 10% were cleared in HDL particles (including particles containing apo E). Since rabbits have about four times the plasma cholesterol ester transfer activity of man, and since the transfer pathway must compete with the selective uptake pathway, these results make it likely that selective uptake plays a substantial role in humans in the clearance of HDL CE.\r"

  ".W": "The renal collecting duct is a site of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) synthesis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is also synthesized within the kidney in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and the distal tubule. EGF has been shown to regulate IGF I expression in nonrenal tissues. To shed light upon a role of EGF in intrarenal regulation of IGF I gene expression, plasma membranes prepared from collecting ducts isolated from rat kidney and collecting ducts themselves were incubated in the presence and absence of recombinant human EGF (hEGF). hEGF enhanced phospholipase C activity in collecting duct plasma membranes establishing the potential for EGF signal transduction at this site. Inclusion of hEGF in suspensions of collecting ducts increased production of immunoreactive IGF I in a concentration-dependent manner. Production was stimulated significantly by addition of 10(-8) or 10(-6) M hEGF to suspensions for 2 h. Levels of IGF I mRNA in collecting ducts were increased 2.8-fold after incubation with 10(-6) M hEGF in vitro. Our findings demonstrate a direct action of hEGF to enhance collecting duct IGF I gene expression in vitro. Such enhancement is likely to reflect an effect of EGF to stimulate IGF I production in the collecting duct of the intact kidney. Since EGF is produced in kidney, our findings are consistent with intrarenal paracrine regulation of IGF I gene expression by EGF.\r"

  ".W": "Two of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase components, p47-phox and p67-phox, translocate to the plasma membrane in normal neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). We have now studied the translocation process in neutrophils of patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an inherited syndrome in which the oxidase system fails to produce superoxide due to lesions affecting any one of its four known components: the gp91-phox and p22-phox subunits of cytochrome b558 (the membrane-bound terminal electron transporter of the oxidase), p47-phox, and p67-phox. In contrast to normal cells, neither p47-phox nor p67-phox translocated to the membrane in PMA-stimulated CGD neutrophils which lack cytochrome b558. In one patient with a rare X-linked form of CGD caused by a Pro----His substitution in gp91-phox, but whose neutrophils have normal levels of this mutant cytochrome b558, translocation was normal. In two patients with p47-phox deficiency, p67-phox failed to translocate, whereas p47-phox was detected in the particulate fraction of PMA-stimulated neutrophils from two patients deficient in p67-phox. Our data suggest that cytochrome b558 or a closely linked factor provides an essential membrane docking site for the cytosolic oxidase components and that it is p47-phox that mediates the assembly of these components on the membrane.\r"

T. Baldwin, R. W. Moskowitz, and D. J. Prockop. 1990. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 87:6565-6568). In the present study we examined whether this predicted protein phenotype was evident in articular cartilage obtained from an affected family member who underwent hip surgery. The cartilage collagen was solubilized by CNBr digestion. Cysteine residues were labeled by reduction and alkylation with 14C-iodoacetate. Collagen CNBr-peptides were fractionated by ion exchange and reverse phase column chromatography. One peptide from the alpha 1(II) chain, alpha 1(II) CB8, was found to be radiolabeled. Tryptic peptides were prepared from it and identified by microsequence analysis. The results show that approximately one-quarter of the alpha 1(II) chains present in the polymeric extracellular collagen of the patient's cartilage contained the Arg519-to-Cys substitution. The protein exhibited other abnormal properties including disulfide-bonded alpha 1(II)-dimers and signs of posttranslational overmodification. The premature cartilage failure and osteoarthritis are presumably a result of the abnormal type II collagen being expressed in the cartilage matrix.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which digestive zymogens become activated during acute pancreatitis remains poorly understood. Given the ability for cholecystokinin (CCK) to induce pancreatitis in vivo, the effects of high dose CCK on preparations of isolated pancreatic acini were examined. Using an immunologic technique for the detection of zymogen activation, CCK was found to stimulate the conversion of procarboxypeptidase A1 to a 35-kD form having the same net charge and electrophoretic mobility as purified recombinant carboxypeptidase A1. This enhanced conversion was proportional to the dose of CCK (maximal at 100 nM), and time dependent. CCK also produced changes in the electrophoretic mobility of procarboxypeptidase B and chymotrypsinogen 2 immunoreactivity, consistent with activation of these zymogens. These events were detectable only within acinar cell pellets and not in the incubation medium, suggesting an intracellular site of conversion. The conversion of procarboxypeptidase A1 to its active form was inhibited by pretreatment with the weak base chloroquine (40 microM) and the protonophore monensin (10 microM). This conversion was also inhibited by pretreatment with the serine protease inhibitor benzamidine (10 mM) but not the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 (100 microM). The results suggest that high dose CCK stimulates the intracellular activation of digestive zymogens within isolated pancreatic acini. This event appears to require an acidic subcellular compartment and serine protease activity.\r"

We have studied two families with, respectively, three and two children with Anderson's disease. Intestinal apo-B and apo-AIV mRNAs from two Anderson's patients were normal in size but their concentration was decreased fivefold compared with controls. After DNA digestion with seven restriction enzymes, restriction fragment length polymorphisms of apo-B gene did not show conclusive information except for Xba1, which revealed a lack of cosegregation between the restriction fragment length polymorphism and the Anderson's phenotype. Linkage analysis was performed using the polymorphism of the apo-B gene 3'minisatellite. Genomic DNA from parents and children was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers flanking the apo-B gene 3'hypervariable locus. In both families each child inherited different apo-B alleles from at least one parent. According to the recessive mode of transmission of the disease, our results are incompatible with the involvement of the apo-B gene. More likely a posttranslational defect or a mutation in another gene encoding a protein essential for lipoprotein assembly or secretion may be involved.\r"

When alpha 2M conformational change was induced with methylamine, 125I-TGF-beta 1 binding significantly increased. Intravenously injected 125I-TGF-beta 1 cleared from the circulation of mice rapidly at first; however, intravascular radioactivity stabilized near 20% of the initial level. At necropsy, radioactivity was recovered predominantly in the liver (65%); however, the density of radioactivity (disintegrations per minute/g organ wt) was highest in the lungs. Markedly different results were obtained with purified 125I-TGF-beta 1-alpha 2M-methylamine complex. Clearance of the complex occurred as a first-order process with a t1/2 of 4 min. Greater than 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in the liver. The clearance and distribution of 125I-TGF-beta 1-alpha 2M-methylamine were equivalent to those observed with 125I-alpha 2M-methylamine and 125I-alpha 2M-trypsin. The latter two radioligands clear via specific alpha 2M receptors in the liver. Large molar excesses of alpha 2M-trypsin or alpha 2M-methylamine competed with 125I-TGF-beta 1-alpha 2M-methylamine for plasma clearance. Native alpha 2M, which does not bind to the alpha 2M receptor, did not compete. The receptor binding domain of alpha 2M-methylamine was blocked by chemical modification or enzyme treatment. The resulting alpha 2M preparations still bound 125I-TGF-beta 1; however, the complexes did not clear when injected intravenously in mice. The studies presented here demonstrate that alpha 2M can mediate the plasma clearance of a growth factor via the alpha 2M receptor system. We propose that alpha 2M, the alpha 2M receptor, and proteinases may function as a concerted system to regulate TGF-beta 1 activity and the activity of related factors in vivo.\r"

Production of the factor may initiate the inflammation associated with alcoholic hepatitis. In previous studies with a cytosol system from liver, production was blocked by iron chelators as well as by catalase and superoxide dismutase, suggesting the involvement of oxyradicals in formation of the chemoattractant. These studies have examined the role of iron in intact hepatocytes using cells from rats fed an iron-deficient diet, a control diet or a diet containing 3% carbonyl iron. The iron content averaged 1.4 nmol/mg protein in iron-deficient cells, 6.3 in controls and 135.3 in iron-loaded cells. Hepatocytes from all groups were established in primary culture and incubated with ethanol (10 mM); the medium was assayed for chemoattractant activity for human neutrophils. Cultures from chow-fed or iron-loaded animals produced chemoattractant as previously reported. By contrast, chemoattractant production was undetectable in the iron-deficient cultures. Addition of ferric citrate (10 microM) restored chemoattractant production while increasing cellular iron in the deficient cells less than 50% (to 2.3 nmol/mg protein). Addition of desferrioxamine mesylate to cultures of iron-loaded cells ablated chemoattractant production. The data provide evidence for the importance of hepatocellular iron in production of this alcohol-related lipid chemoattractant and suggest that a small intracellular pool of \"free\" iron plays a critical role.\r"

  ".W": "Initiation and regulation of localized selective proteolysis is an important effector property of cells of macrophage (Mo) lineage. Among such effector responses is the induced expression of tissue factor (TF) by cells of Mo lineage. In characterizing the regulation of the Mo responses that may influence the magnitude of the effector phase of the cellular immune response, we have identified a role for the cell surface adhesive receptor CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1, CR3) to amplify the induced TF response. Occupancy of CD11b/CD18 by MAb as surrogate ligands does not directly initiate a TF response. In contrast, after either T cell-derived cytokine or LPS as initial signals, engagement of CD11b/CD18 by MAb induces a two- to eight-fold functional enhancement of the TF response in murine and human Mo. This pathway of CD11b/CD18 enhancement of this Mo effector response was also confirmed with recognized ligands for CD11b/CD18 by exposure of Mo to immobilized fibrinogen. A quantitative increase of Mo surface expression of TF was validated by flow cytometry. We suggest that engagement of CD11b/CD18 by complementary ligands including adherence to extracellular matrix, and possibly in antigen-driven TH:Mo collaborative responses, results in the transduction of cellular signals that quantitatively enhance the expression of TF per se and thereby enhance the inflammatory component of Mo mediated response.\r"

  ".U": "91086478\r", 
  ".W": "The isoform of Fc gamma RIII (CD16) expressed on PMN has a GPI membrane anchor, and in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) there is a deficiency in Fc gamma RIII expression on PMN. Contrary to expectation, however, CD16 expression is preserved (albeit at reduced levels) in all affected PNH PMN that completely lack the GPI-anchored proteins DAF (CD55) and CD59. Fc gamma RIII negative PMN are not observed in any of the six PNH patients examined in this study. Analysis of the molecular weight of both glycosylated and deglycosylated Fc gamma RIII from PMN with reduced Fc gamma RIII expression indicates no variations in size relative to normal donor Fc gamma RIIIPMN. Indeed, the Fc gamma RIII expressed at intermediate levels is phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC)-sensitive. Thus, there is no evidence suggestive of expression of a transmembrane isoform and all data indicate that Fc gamma RIIIPMN on affected cells in PNH is a GPI-linked isoform. With Fc gamma RIIIPMN expression preserved at reduced levels on affected cells in PNH, PMN from PNH patients retain the capacity to internalize the Fc gamma RIIIPMN-specific probe E-ConA (at reduced levels) as well as IgG-opsonized erythrocytes. Reduced expression of GPI-anchored molecules on PNH PMN is not restricted to Fc gamma RIIIPMN since intermediate levels of CD59 were observed in the PNH PMN that were decay-accelerating factor (DAF)-negative and Fc gamma RIIIPMN intermediate. In addition, discordant expression of GPI-linked molecules in individual cells is not restricted to PMN since DAF+/CD14- monocytes were observed in one PNH patient. These data suggest that, when analyzed on an individual cell level, the GPI anchor defect in PNH is not absolute and must involve either a hierarchy of access of different protein molecules to available GPI anchors, distinct anchor biochemistries for the different proteins, or differential regulation of protein-anchor assembly.\r"

In this study, we report data showing that immature human erythroblasts express the integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 and that both these molecules act as fibronectin receptors on these cells. We have recently demonstrated that adhesion to Fn of purified human CFU-E and their immediate progeny preproerythroblasts was inhibited by antibodies directed against the human fibronectin receptor (VLA-5). Here we have extended those results and characterized by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies the integrins expressed on surface-labeled normal human immature erythroblasts. A polyclonal antibody recognizing the common VLA beta 1 subunit yielded two polypeptides of 120 and 160 kD. Our data further demonstrate that the polypeptide of 160 kD contains alpha subunits corresponding to both alpha 4 and alpha 5. Thus, erythroblast lysates prepared in 0.3% CHAPS and immunoprecipitated with antibodies which specifically recognize the alpha 4 subunit showed a heterodimer with peptides of 120 (beta 1) and 160 kD (alpha 4) and the additional peptides of 70 and 80 kD which usually coprecipitate with the alpha 4 chain. On the other hand, specific anti-alpha 5 antibodies immunoprecipitated an alpha 5/beta 1 complex with peptides of 120 and 160 kD which under reducing conditions migrated as a single band of 130 kD. Similar experiments performed with an erythroleukemic cell line (KU 812) showed that these cells also coexpress both the VLA-4 and VLA-5 members of the integrin family. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies recognizing the VLA alpha 4 chain blocked the adhesion of immature erythroblasts to Fn-coated surfaces, thus demonstrating that, as VLA-5, VLA-4 is also a functional Fn receptor on these cells.\r"

To define the 52-kD component unambiguously, cDNA clones were isolated from human HepG2 and MOLT-4 cell cDNA libraries. The identity of cDNA was established by (a) the specificity of the antibody affinity purified from the recombinant protein, (b) the reactivity of the purified recombinant protein with prototype SS-A/Ro sera in immunoblot and ELISA, and (c) two-dimensional gel comigration of MOLT-4 cell 52-kD protein and the recombinant protein. A 1.9-kb cDNA encoded the complete 52-kD protein containing 475 amino acids (Mr 54,082). Putative zinc-finger domains and a leucine zipper motif were identified in the amino-terminal half of the 52-kD protein, implicating its possible association with DNA/RNA. Sequence homology detected between the 52-kD protein and human ret transforming protein, and mouse T cell gene expression down-regulatory protein rpt-1, may provide leads to the functional role of the 52-kD protein in addition to the possibility that these proteins might constitute members of a subfamily of finger proteins.\r"

To begin to investigate the source of this variability, we examined (a) immunological cross-reactivity and (b) cDNA cross-hybridization, among several mucin-secreting organs of the human body. Peptide-directed antibodies raised against both nondeglycosylated (LS) and deglycosylated (HFB) intestinal mucin strongly stained mucous cells in the bronchial epithelium and submucosal glands, indicating homology between mucins of the bronchus and intestine at the peptide level. By screening a bronchus cDNA library with an intestinal mucin cDNA, SMUC-41, we isolated a bronchus mucin cDNA, HAM-1. This cDNA is 96% homologous to the first repeat of SMUC-41. HAM-1 hybridized to restriction fragments of human genomic DNA identical to those hybridizing to SMUC-41 on Southern blots. SMUC-41 also hybridized to polydisperse transcripts in the bronchus, cervix, gall bladder, and mammary gland, indicating mucin homology among all these organs at the RNA level.

During the control study plasma FFA fell from 610 +/- 46 to 232 +/- 42 to 154 +/- 27 mumol/liter, respectively. When heparin was infused basal plasma FFA concentration remained constant. During the control study, FFA/lipid oxidation rates decreased in parallel with the fall in the plasma FFA concentration. During the insulin/heparin study, plasma 14C-FFA oxidation remained unchanged while net lipid oxidation decreased. In conclusion, when the plasma FFA concentration is maintained unchanged by heparin infusion, insulin has no direct effect on FFA turnover and disposal. These results thus suggest that plasma FFA oxidation is primarily determined by the plasma FFA concentration, while net lipid oxidation is regulated by both the plasma FFA and the insulin level.\r"

The MFC were isolated under sterile conditions using an enzymatic digestion procedure and discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. The purity of the MFC preparations was verified immunocytochemically with the macrophage specific monoclonal antibody RAM-11. MFC plated in medium containing 0.5% FCS for 24 h contained approximately 600 micrograms cholesterol per mg cell protein, 80% of which was esterified cholesterol. The MFC specifically degraded low density lipoprotein (LDL), acetyl-LDL, copper oxidized LDL, and beta-very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) at rates comparable to mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) in 5-h assays. MFC within sections of the atherosclerotic lesions from the ballooned rabbits as well as the MFC isolated from the same lesions in the presence of antioxidants, exhibited positive immunoreactivity with polyclonal guinea pig antisera and mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against malondialdehyde-LDL, and 4-hydroxynonal-LDL. The MFC also exhibited the capacity to induce the oxidation of LDL at rates comparable to those exhibited by MPM and rabbit aortic endothelial cells. These data provide direct evidence that arterial wall macrophages express modified LDL receptors in vivo, contain epitopes found in oxidized-LDL and are capable of oxidizing LDL even when maximally loaded with cholesterol.\r"

The widespread, but not ubiquitous, distribution of LFA-3 contrasted with the more restricted distribution of ICAM-1. Among epithelial cells, all tissues which were ICAM-1 positive were also LFA-3 positive with the single exception that thymic cortical epithelium, in contrast to previous reports, expressed only ICAM-1. It was striking that LFA-3 molecules were absent in some tissues which are considered to be sites of immunological privilege (such as brain and testis), suggesting an additional mechanism by which these microenvironments maintain immunological autonomy. Furthermore, the unexpected finding that LFA-3 is strongly expressed on intercalated discs of cardiac muscle may possibly be related to a non-immune function, or indicate a structurally similar epitope expressed by an unrelated molecule within this tissue.\r"

In normal colonic mucosa PSTI was found in the goblet cells in the basal parts of the crypts. In adenomas of tubular, villous, and tubulo-villous types PSTI was also found in the upper parts of the polyps, usually occurring in the regeneration zone. There was a more intense staining reaction in polyps with increased atypia. Carcinomas of different types and of various grades of differentiation and of in situ type did not contain PSTI. These findings indicate that PSTI could be a marker for adenomatous rather than carcinomatous epithelium in the colon. Furthermore, the absence of the inhibitor in malignant cells might facilitate tissue invasion by malignant cells because of deficient protease inhibition.\r"

Another seven cases are described which show the presence of laminin and collagens IV and III within the proliferation. Electron microscopy examination of two cases using material retrieved from the wax block showed varying degrees of myoepithelial differentiation of the cells immediately surrounding the spherules and basal lamina material, including mature collagen fibrils in one case. The degree of myoepithelial differentiation of the cells surrounding the spherules seemed to correlate with the differing types and amounts of extracellular matrix in the spherule. Histopathologists should be aware of this rare change as it may be misinterpreted as in situ carcinoma.\r"

Both systems use double-stranded genomic DNA probes for the detection of type specific HPV DNA. The probes used on the dot blots were labelled with 32P and visualised autoradiographically. The Vira Type probes were labelled with biotin and visualised using a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate with NBT-BCIP substrate. Biopsy specimens from the cervix, vagina, and vulva of 46 women were processed by both methods and compared. The histological diagnoses ranged from benign changes, to dysplasia, and invasive carcinoma. Overall, 50% of biopsy specimens were positive for HPV DNA by dot blot hybridisation; only 39% were positive by Vira Type in situ hybridisation. Three of the specimens positive by the Vira Type \"in situ\" kit showed no cross hybridisation and were the same HPV type as the dot blot. A further 13 showed hybridisation, but the showed cross hybridisation, but the to the dot blot results. One biopsy specimen was positive for different HPV types by the two tests and one was positive by Vira Type and negative by dot blot. Six biopsy specimens were negative by Vira Type but positive by dot blot. It is concluded that the Vira Type \"in situ\" kit has a similar specificity but lower sensitivity than the dot blot hybridisation method for the detection of HPV DNA.\r"

In six cases an autoradiographic signal was obtained in the tumour cell nuclei with the HPV type 16 specific probe. No signal was obtained with any of the other probes. Immunohistochemical investigations with mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the L1 protein of HPV type and a rabbit antiserum that detects common protein determinants of HPV gave negative results, thus indicating latent infection. Furthermore, a series of tonsils from controls with comparable age distribution was negative by both in situ hybridisation and immunohistology.

Ten patients with a variety of common upper gastrointestinal disorders underwent continuous gastric aspiration for 16 hours, including a fasting, post-prandial, and nocturnal period, and aliquots of aspirates were analysed every two hours by the HPLC technique for the six most prevalent bile acid conjugates present in human hepatic bile. Intragastric bile acid concentrations were lowest in the post-prandial period and highest in the early hours of the morning. Conjugated bile acid proportions, or profiles, varied considerably from patient to patient, but tended to remain uniform over time in individual patients. It is concluded that HPLC is superior to enzymatic techniques for the analysis of conjugated bile acids in the upper gastrointestinal tract.\r"

The distribution of ALT activities displayed a positive skewness, and so both logarithmic transformation and subsequent calculation of mean and standard deviation as well as non-parametric analysis were used to obtain best estimates of reference ranges for men and women, 5-65 IU/1 and 5-35 IU/1, respectively. ALT activities were found to be higher in plasmapheresis donors than in normal blood donors of both sexes, and it is postulated that this difference may be related to the increased frequency of donation in the former group.\r"

Frozen sections of trephine biopsy specimens from iliac crests were stained for endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity, endogenous acid phosphatase activity, and, using immunocytochemical methods, for endothelial cells (anti-factor-VIII related antigen) and macrophages and related cells (EBM/11). In granulocytic malignancies, whether acute or chronic, alkaline phosphatase positive reticulum cells (AL-RC) and vascular endothelial cells were generally increased. In lymphoid malignancies, the numbers of AL-RC were generally reduced. Numbers of vascular endothelial cells seemed to be normal in ALL but reduced in foci of NHL. Macrophages are numerous in normal marrow, and their numbers seemed to be normal in granulocytic lesions but were more variable and sometimes reduced in ALL and NHL. Lymphoid malignancies, therefore, have a destructive effect on some stromal elements; granulocytic malignancies are associated with normal or increased numbers of stromal cells. A possible consequence of depleted stromal cells might be slower reconstitution of normal haemopoiesis after treatment. The large numbers in granulocytic malignancies raises the possibility of synergistic stimulation between stromal and neoplastic cells.\r"

More than 50% of the United Kingdom patients had high IgG responses in ELISAs for E histolytica and G lamblia. A confirmatory ELISA showed that the British sera reacted specifically to bovine serum proteins rather than to protozoal antigens. Prior incubation of sera with 5% bovine serum prohibited this reaction. Bovine serum is an integral part of the crude soluble antigen used in most ELISAs for E histolytica and G lamblia and needs to be replaced with purified antigen preparations. The British sera also reacted to other commonly used blocking agents such as bovine serum albumin, casein, and normal sheep serum.

Three hundred and ninety nine urine samples containing 541 bacterial isolates were assessed for the presence of ACB; 13% were found to be positive and 87% negative for ACB; 67% of urines contained a single bacterial isolate. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most commonly associated with clinical urinary tract infection, found in 25% of episodes, followed by Proteus mirabilis (17.5%), Klebsiella sp (12.5%), and Proteus morganii (10%). Providencia stuartii, however, was most commonly associated with a positive ACB test (found in 17%). Other bacteria associated with a positive ACB test included Klebsiella sp (14%), Acinetobacter sp (12.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Citrobacter sp (11.5%). A positive ACB test is not to be expected from a patient with spinal injury who has a catheter in place, and the test may provide a useful guide to identify those patients with an invasive infection. It is doubtful that a decision to treat or not treat bacteriuria could rest on the identification of the bacterial species alone.\r"

Twenty three patterns of agglutination (lectin types) were recorded among 376 isolates. Patterns were consistent and reproducible. Only 4.5% of isolates were untypable because of autoagglutination. Some lectin types were found exclusively or predominantly in a species, but others were shared between species. Forty two per cent of C jejuni and 35% of C coli isolates belonged to lectin type 4. There was no apparent correlation between lectin type and serotype; different lectin types were found among strains of single Penner and Lior serotypes. Lectin typing is a simple and economical procedure suitable for use in non-specialist laboratories, either as an adjunct to serogrouping or, after further development, as a sole typing scheme.\r"

Using identical parameters for professional tattoos, there was complete pigment removal in two, nearly complete pigment removal in five, significant pigment removal in 18, minimal pigment removal in 25, and very little pigment removal in 12. Professional tattoos with red, yellow, and green pigments faded, but required multiple retreatments.

These benefits are achieved because all incisions are through chemically fixed (killed) tissue, eliminating the danger of disseminating the highly transplantable melanoma cells and permitting the excision of successive layers for microscopic scanning of their undersurfaces by the systematic use of frozen sections. The process is continued to the termination of each ramification. There is no need to remove a wide margin of normal tissue as is customary with conventional surgery. Clinically invisible satellites are not moved or disturbed and can be removed safely by the same method if they appear. The reliability of the method is manifested by the 62.5% 5-year cure in a series of 10 consecutive patients, all of whom had no local recurrence after micrographic surgery.\r"

Forty 6-mm punch-biopsy wounds were created in the ears of two control rabbits as well as two experimental animals fed isotretinoin, 4 mg/kg per day. Clinical inspection and histologic examination revealed no difference between the control and isotretinoin-treated rabbits in terms of the time required for complete wound healing or the appearance of the final scar. The tissue removed from the wound site at days 0, 7, 14, and 21 after wounding was subjected to analysis of a collagen production and collagen gene expression. Collagen production, determined by the synthesis of [3H]hydroxyproline after incubation of tissue slices with [3H]proline in vitro or by the measurement of the steady-state levels of types I and III procollagen mRNAs, was not significantly different between the two groups. The results indicate that systemic administration of isotretinoin does not affect collagen synthesis in the rabbit ear model of wound healing.\r"

We analyzed histamine, prostaglandin D2, IL-1, and leukocytes accumulating hourly for 12 hours at skin-chamber sites after local ragweed challenge in eight allergic subjects with cutaneous late-phase reactions. Ragweed induced a peak of histamine at 1 hour (p less than 0.02), which diminished, and then steadily increased (p less than 0.02). Prostaglandin D2 levels peaked by the second hour (p less than 0.02) and then decreased, approaching prechallenge levels by 12 hours. Leukocyte infiltration (predominantly neutrophils) was detectable 3 to 4 hours after challenge, although selective enrichment of mononuclear cells, eosinophils, and basophils ws observed at later hours (p less than 0.02). IL-1 bioactivity was detected in fluids 10 to 12 hours after challenge but not at control sites (p less than 0.05). Analysis of IL-1 beta levels by RIA revealed an initial peak at 1 hour of 0.90 ng/ml (p less than 0.02) and a second elevation of up to 0.75 ng/ml during the later hours (p less than 0.04). Ragweed challenge of three nonatopic subjects did not change levels of the above-mentioned mediators or cells. Bioactivity in chamber fluids from antigen-challenged sites of atopic subjects was significantly neutralized by an anti-IL-1 beta antiserum, although treatment with anti-IL-1 alpha and anti-IL-1 beta was needed for complete neutralization, IL-1 released locally during cutaneous allergic reactions may contribute to IgE-dependent cutaneous inflammation.\r"

PAF decreased the basal cAMP level and significantly inhibited the response to isoproterenol stimulation, (4) there was no difference in density and affinity of platelet alpha-receptors or in platelet cAMP responses to stimulation by alpha-agonists among these three groups, and (5) neither cAMP response or beta-receptor density on mononuclear cells were significantly correlated with pulmonary-function tests (FEV/FVC times 100), sensitivity to methacholine, or cold-air inhalation. These results suggest that patients with asthma may have a lower isoproterenol cAMP response and decreased density of beta-adrenergic receptors on mononuclear cells in the absence of beta-agonist therapy. It is speculated that release of PAF and other mediators secondary to allergen exposure, even in the absence of overt attacks of asthma, may inhibit the response to endogenous or exogenous beta-adrenergic agonists.\r"

We evaluated the nasal response by measuring the levels of histamine, TAME-esterase activity, and kinins in the nasal lavage fluid and by grading symptoms. Fifty-one subjects (92.7%) had an ER consisting of a dose-dependent, concommitant increase in both mediators and symptoms. The total amount of TAME-esterase activity and kinins generated during ER correlated significantly with specific serum IgE (ssIgE), intradermal skin test (ST) sensitivity, and basophil histamine release (BHR) to antigen E (p less than 0.01 for each). Twenty-four (47%) subjects developed a late increase in mediators and 23 (45%) subjects in symptoms. None of the four subjects without an ER developed an LPR. The levels of the late-appearing mediators were not predicted by ST, ssIgE, or BHR. There was a significant but weak association between the intensity of ER and LPR, but there was no significant difference in the IgE antibodies, ST, BHR, and intensity or threshold of ER between dual and early only reactors. The number of eosinophils and neutrophils in the LPR lavages increased over the prechallenge baseline, and their numbers correlated (p less than 0.05) with ER kinins (r = 0.46, and 0.37, respectively), ER TAME-esterase activity (r = 0.28 and 0.24, respectively), and in the case of eosinophils, ER histamine (r = 0.29).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Baseline levels were determined in 34 normal control subjects and 29 atopic patients. Increases of urine N-MH values were measured during histamine infusions and in venom-allergic patients receiving bee-sting challenges. N-MH was determined by a newly developed radioimmunoassay. Baseline levels in control subjects and atopic patients demonstrated no significant differences. With regard to challenge tests, fluctuation of N-MH levels during a 6-hour period was measured. Random 6-hour increases in healthy and atopic subjects ranged from 5% to 41%. Before infusion of histamine (0.25 micrograms/kg/min for 30 minutes), baseline values were 137 +/- 11.4 micrograms N-MH per gram of creatinine and 9 +/- 1.1 micrograms N-MH per hour (n = 9). Levels peaked 1 hour after infusion at 275 +/- 45 micrograms/gm of creatinine and 44 +/- 5.6 micrograms/hr and decreased to resting levels after 2 hours. Metabolization by N-MH accounted for 9.5% +/- 4.9% (range, 2.4% to 18.4%) of infused histamine in the urine of the nine subjects. Bee-sting challenges were performed in 12 patients and three control subjects. Only in three patients experiencing generalized urticaria, nausea, dyspnea, and hypotension were significant increases of urine N-MH levels (138%, 144%, and 238%) observed.

A significant clinical reaction and neutrophil accumulation in the tear film occurred at 20 minutes. At 1 hour, a clinical response and tear cytologic reaction were present only at higher antigen concentrations. Six hours after antigen challenge, only the highest allergen concentration (320,000 BU/ml) produced a clinical late-phase reaction (LPR) (p less than 0.01) and tear cytologic change (presence of eosinophils and lymphocytes). Five nonryegrass-sensitive control subjects were unresponsive to a similar challenge. These results indicate that a conjunctival response to allergen challenge is dose dependent, that is, the higher the dose, the more likely an LPR will occur and that an LPR correlates with significant numbers of inflammatory cells in the tear film.\r"

More patients in groups IV C and IV D had positive RASTs for a panel of environmental antigens than patients in the other HIV-seropositive groups and the HIV-seronegative control group.

We found that lymphocytes from atopic patients were less susceptible to inhibition by the three agents that elevate intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations and by the active metabolite of vitamin D (inhibition of 27%, 14%, 12%, and 36% for the atopic patients as compared with 40%, 20%, 22%, and 46% for the normal donors, by the four agents, respectively; p less than 0.02). The inhibitory effect of the cAMP-elevating agents was potentiated by the addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to the lymphocyte cultures. The potentiation was more pronounced on lymphocytes from the atopic donors, increasing their responsiveness to levels comparable to levels of lymphocytes from normal donors. The synthetic corticosteroid, dexamethasone, had a similar potentiating effect on the inhibitory action of prostaglandin E2. In view of the beneficial action of beta-agonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and corticosteroids in the treatment of allergy, the potentiating effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the action of cAMP-elevating agents may be of therapeutic interest.\r"

In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we evaluated the effects of loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, and placebo administered once daily for 3 days on the skin-wheal responses to histamine, the airway responses to inhaled histamine and methacholine, and the skin-wheal and airway responses to allergen in 12 subjects with asthma. There was no evidence of a bronchodilator action 3 hours after a third oral dose. In the airways, the geometric mean of the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 after placebo or loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, was 0.68 mg/ml, 2.71 mg/ml (p, not significant), and 5.96 mg/ml (p less than 0.05), respectively. The concentration ratios (value after active treatment/value after placebo) for loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, were 5.1 (p less than 0.05) and 13.4 (p less than 0.05). Neither dose of loratadine had any significant effect on the methacholine dose-response relationship. In the skin, loratadine also displaced the histamine log-concentration response curves to the right with concentration ratios of 4.7 and 6.7, respectively. Loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, had no protective effect on the early or late-phase bronchoconstrictor responses to inhaled allergen. In the skin, loratadine, 20 mg, significantly inhibited the mean wheal area to allergen. Thus, in the dose regimens studied, although loratadine is a moderately potent and selective H1 antagonist in the skin and airways, it failed to attenuate the early and late airway responses to inhaled allergen.\r"

These groups consisted of 32 newly diagnosed children with asthma, 40 good responders and 18 poor responders to IT (older than 2 years), and 15 healthy subjects. The results demonstrated (1) peripheral blood mononuclear cells of new patients produced a much greater HRF activity, either spontaneously or after stimulation, than did those of normal subjects, (2) the spontaneous HRF activity decreased significantly in good responders, whereas that of poor responders increased, (3) both the allergen (mite)- and mitogen (phytohemagglutinin [PHA])-stimulated HRF activity was decreased, although decrease was not significant, in good responders, but the activity was not changed in poor responders, (4) the granulocytes of new patients responded to HRF much more vigorously than did granulocytes of normal subjects. The responsiveness diminished significantly in both good and poor responders, although the magnitude of decrease was slightly greater in the former, (5) there was a positive correlation between PHA- and mite-stimulated HRF activity, mite-stimulated HRF activity and responsiveness to HRF, and plasma histamine level and responsiveness to HRF in the new patients, and (6) there was an inverse correlation between PHA-stimulated HRF production and responsiveness to HRF in good responders, but the correlation was positive in poor responders. Thus, IT is able to suppress the HRF activity, particularly the type of spontaneous synthesis, and responsiveness to HRF in clinically benefitted children with asthma, and this effect may be used to explain, partly, the efficacy of IT in a proportion of allergic patients.\r"

  ".W": "The novel antiallergy compound, 5-methoxy-3-(1-methylethoxy)-1-phenyl-N-1H-tetrazol-5-yl-1H- indole-2- carboxamide, L-arginine salt (CI-949), inhibited mediator release from human basophilic leukocytes and from human chopped lung mast cells challenged with anti-IgE. In leukocytes, CI-949 was a more potent inhibitor of leukotriene C4/D4 and thromboxane B2 release (concentration of drug that inhibits mediator release by 50% [IC50] 0.5 and 0.1 mumol/L, respectively) than of histamine (IC50, 11.4 mumol/L) when anti-IgE was the challenging stimulus. In human lung, inhibition of release of all three mediators occurred at approximately equal concentrations (IC50s for histamine, 16.6 mumol/L; for leukotriene C4/D4, 7.1 mumol/L; and for thromboxane B2, 6.2 mumol/L). The inhibition of histamine release from basophils by CI-949 was further characterized using a variety of stimuli. Challenge with anti-IgE, histamine-releasing factor derived from lymphocytes, N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine, and concanavalin A revealed potent inhibition (IC50, 10 to 15 mumol/L). CI-949 was less potent versus calcium ionophore A23187, phorbol myristate acetate (12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), and C5a (IC50s, 30, 54, and 60 mumol/L, respectively). These results suggest that diverse pathways of cell activation-excitation coupling exist for different stimuli in basophils. Furthermore, the activity and potency of CI-949 in inhibiting release of histamine, leukotrienes, and thromboxane from both human basophils and mast cells suggest that the compound will be effective clinically for indications in which these mediators are implicated, including asthma and allergic rhinitis.\r"

(N = 14). Airway response to histamine and methacholine was assessed as the provocative concentration (in milligrams per milliliter) necessary to increase the specific airway resistance (SRaw) (in centimeters of H2O times second) by 100% (PC100 SRaw). Airway response to hyperventilation of air and to hyperventilation of 0.75 ppm of sulfur dioxide (SO2) was determined as the provocative ventilation (in liters per minute) necessary to increase SRaw by 75% (PV75 SRaw). Challenges were performed on separate days before and after treatment, and salbutamol inhalation was withheld at least 6 hours before each challenge. Salbutamol and placebo did not change perchallenge baseline SRaw nor did they have any significant effect on the airway response to the stimuli. Salbutamol and BDP decreased the mean prechallenge baseline SRaw (SEM) from 7.7 (0.37) to 5.9 (0.28) (p less than 0.01) and significantly (p less than 0.01) increased geometric mean (SEM) PC100 SRaw for histamine from 0.5 (1.42) to 0.9 (1.53) mg/ml; for methacholine, from 0.2 (1.47) to 0.5 (1.51) mg/ml; and mean (SEM) PV75 SRaw for hyperventilation of air from 51.8 (2.32) to 58.4 (1.86) L/min.

Results demonstrated that challenge with PGF2 alpha increased nasal patency, whereas challenge with all other substances decreased patency. The relationship between substances in eliciting a nasal congestive response was prostaglandin D2 greater than histamine greater than bradykinin greater than methacholine. A similar effect ordering was noted for the postchallenge development of eustachian tube dysfunction. Secretion weights were significantly greater after challenge with histamine compared to all other substances. A decrease in pulmonary function was observed only after challenge with PGF2 alpha, although the effect was not statistically significant. No changes in middle-ear pressure were observed for challenges with any of the substances. Only histamine challenge provoked sneezing, whereas challenge with either of the prostaglandins provoked cough. With the exception of methacholine, all substances caused symptoms of rhinorrhea, congestion, and sore throat. Bradykinin was particularly effective in provoking \"pain/pressure\"-related symptoms. With the exception of secretion weight, the differences between responses of atopic and nonatopic subjects were not statistically significant. These results document mediator specificity in the physiologic and symptomatic responses to intranasal challenge.\r"

A cross-reactive, apparently homologous allergen, from P. americana and B. germanica bound IgE from 100% and 70%, respectively, of the patients. These important allergens were tentatively named Per a I and Bla g I. The allergens were purified by sequential ion exchange, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing. Both allergens had a molecular size of 33 to 37 kd in Sephadex G-75 gel filtration, and 28 kd in high-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a minor band at approximately 25 kd, and most of the protein at 6 kd. The isoelectric point of both allergens was found be to 3.5. In amino acid analysis, the allergens were highly similar. Skin test revealed the allergens to be important in vivo sensitizing agents.

  ".W": "Intranasal budesonide, 400 micrograms two times a day, was evaluated in 36 patients referred for treatment of nasal polyposis. The age range was 20 to 68 years. Polypectomy was done 5.6 (mean) times previously. After a 5-week, treatment-free, baseline period, patients were treated in a double-blind fashion with either budesonide or placebo during 4 weeks. After this treatment period, placebo-treated patients started receiving budesonide in an open trial for an additional 4 weeks. The patients rated their nasal symptoms daily. Nasal examinations and nasal inspiratory flow rate (IFR) measurements were done at clinic visits. After 3 and 4 weeks of treatment, the response to budesonide was significantly greater than response to placebo. The greater reduction in nasal blockage caused by polyps, observed on physical examination, p = 0.005, was mirrored by an increase in nasal IFR (p = 0.0001). Patient rating of the severity and frequency of nasal blockage were reduced more by budesonide than by placebo (p less than or equal to 0.0005). Switching placebo-treated patients to budesonide treatment resulted in a reduction of nasal blockage (p less than 0.001) and an increase in nasal IFR (p less than 0.001). The results demonstrate that topical nasal budesonide, 400 micrograms two times a day, is an effective treatment of nasal polyps.\r"

  ".W": "A 24-year-old white woman reported sexual intercourse-related pruritus, hives, wheezing, and dyspnea within 5 minutes after ejaculation. Systemic reactions (SRs) were prevented by use of condoms. Prick testing confirmed sensitization to five Sephadex G-100-separated fractions of her husband's seminal plasma. The intradermal end point threshold concentrations (ETC) were 10(-4) and 10(-1) micrograms of protein per milliliter to fractions 2 and 3, respectively. Leukocyte histamine release studies exhibited 100% release to fraction 2 and 37% release to fraction 3. A 2-day protocol of rapid immunotherapy (IT) was performed with subcutaneous incremental doses of human seminal plasma (HuSePl) fractions 2 and 3. The patient experienced an SR after receiving a cumulative dose of 38.55 micrograms of fraction 2 on day 1. On day 2, rapid IT with fraction 2 was administered until the patient experienced a mild SR after having received a cumulative dose of 102.8 micrograms. There was a one-log10 increase in the intradermal ETC to both fractions 2 and 3 at the end of day 2. IT was continued three times weekly for 4 months until the patient tolerated 100 micrograms doses of both fractions 2 and 3. At 4 months, coitus was resumed without SRs, and HuSePl IT was stopped. The intradermal ETC to fractions 1, 3, 4, and 5 was increased 6 months after cessation of HuSePl injections, but there was a one-log decrease in the ETC to fraction 2. Our experience demonstrated that systemic tolerance can be achieved by parenteral administration of selected HuSePl fractions. Partial immunologic desensitization of patients with anaphylactic sensitivity can be achieved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The chief clinical problem is the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria. H1-receptor antagonists are the major class of therapeutic agents used in the management of chronic idiopathic urticaria. The H1 antagonists have been divided into subgroups based on their chemical structure. The second-generation H1 antagonists now available are particularly advantageous for individuals who must remain alert while working. Terbutaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, is of occasional benefit as an adjunct therapy in combination with an H1 antagonist. The oral administration of disodium cromoglycate is ineffective in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, although a few individuals with urticaria caused by food allergy may respond to this drug. It is best to avoid repeated injections of epinephrine and the systemic administration of corticosteroids. Urticaria has a capricious course: it may respond to the administration of placebos or it may resolve spontaneously. About 50% of the patients with urticaria are free of lesions within 1 year, but 20% continue to have episodes for more than 20 years.\r"

In an effort to avoid the risks associated with corticosteroid treatment, many first-generation H1-receptor antagonists have been tried and found to induce undesirable levels of sedation when given in amounts sufficient to control urticaria. Cetirizine, a pharmacologically active oxidized metabolite of hydroxyzine, was developed to provide selective H1-receptor inhibition without depression of the central nervous system. In a 4-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy study, cetirizine, in a once-a-day dose (5 to 20 mg), was equivalent in efficacy to hydroxyzine in divided doses (25 to 75 mg/day). The incidence of somnolence in the cetirizine group was not significantly different from that of the placebo group. However, in the hydroxyzine group, the incidence of somnolence was significantly higher than that in the placebo group (p = 0.001). The results of this study demonstrate that cetirizine has a greater safety margin over the older parent drug hydroxyzine.\r"

  ".W": "First-generation H1-antagonist antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine, have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation, which limits their usefulness in the treatment of allergic disorders. Cetirizine, a carboxylated metabolite of hydroxyzine, possesses the parent compound's antihistaminic activity but causes less sedation. We compared the activity of cetirizine at central H1 sites with that of hydroxyzine and terfenadine. We also compared the ability of cetirizine and three antihistamines to cross the blood-brain barrier. In each case we found that the drug's potency at H1 receptors in the central nervous system was similar to its activity in displacing H1 receptors in the lung. However, the selectivity for H1 receptors varied widely from drug to drug. Cetirizine did not bind at any of the receptors investigated, except H1 sites, even at concentrations as high as 10 mumol/L. Hydroxyzine and dexchlorpheniramine and, to a lesser extent, terfenadine crossed the blood-brain barrier in significant amounts. Cetirizine passed into the central nervous system only half as readily as terfenadine. These findings suggest that cetirizine's low incidence of sedative effects is most likely caused by its diminished potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and also may be partly the result of its greater selectivity for H1 receptors, compared with its effect at other receptors that may be involved in sedation.\r"

Subjects slept in the laboratory for 2 consecutive nights to facilitate adaptation. During the second night, the subjects' sleep patterns were recorded by electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram, and chin electromyogram. After the second night, subjects were awakened at 7:30 AM and given a single dose of the assigned treatment. Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (standardized 20-minute opportunities to fall asleep in bed while EEG and eye movements are recorded) were given every 2 hours. Subjects who received cetirizine did not differ from control subjects given placebo in any measure of daytime alertness. Subjects who received hydroxyzine were significantly more sedated than were control subjects given placebo for about 4 hours after treatment. The data from this study provide evidence that cetirizine does not differ from placebo with respect to alertness. The usefulness of the specific and sensitive standardized electroencephalogram, compared with alternative assessments of daytime alertness, is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The newer, second-generation H1-receptor antagonists have been shown to have potent antiallergic effects without inducing sleepiness. However, because traditional antihistamines may cause functional or cognitive impairment, the clinician still must consider warning patients about activities that could be hazardous. Because the effects of drugs on driving an automobile are difficult to measure directly, studies must use surrogate activities in a laboratory setting. Effects of antihistamines on the central nervous system are assessed with psychomotor tests, which are selected on the basis of their relativity to real-world activities, to develop a profile of mental processes that may be affected. This article reviews the psychomotor tests and study design used to characterize the intensity and duration of drug effects after single and multiple doses and in combination with other impairing agents such as ethanol. Several studies have been published that assess the effects of cetirizine, an H1-receptor blocker, on mental performance. In the study discussed here, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and hydroxyzine were used as positive controls to demonstrate that the period during which some traditional antihistamines impair performance is different than the period of reported drowsiness they induce. The results of this series of studies show that cetirizine induced minimal changes in mental performance tests and only following the highest (20 mg) dose studied.\r"

They are effective in reducing histamine-related symptoms, but the use of such agents has been limited by sedation and anticholinergic side effects. These adverse effects are fewer with the recently introduced H1 antihistamines. One of these, cetirizine, a human metabolite of hydroxyzine, is characterized by its high selectivity for the H1 receptor site and its reliable and consistent inhibition of histamine-induced allergic reactions. It also blocks eosinophil infiltration to the site of allergen-induced cutaneous reactions. Cetirizine has proved effective in the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and urticaria. It is excreted primarily by renal mechanisms. It is well tolerated by elderly patients. Cetirizine has a low rate of penetration of the blood-brain barrier, and it has minimal central nervous system impairment. Furthermore, it can be given once a day. Cetirizine's low incidence of sedation and anticholinergic side effects contribute to its high profile of safety. In this article the characteristics, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and mode of action of cetirizine are reviewed.\r"

The mother's perception of family functioning was assessed at the initial prenatal visit using the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES II). All obstetric patients at four family medicine clinics from April 1984 through April 1987 whose initial prenatal visits occurred by the 28th week of gestation were invited to participate; 95% chose to do so. Information was obtained on 833 mother-infant pairs. Listwise deletion on any one variable reduced the sample to 772 with no apparent bias in the dependent or predetermined variables. Twelve percent of the families were considered to be dysfunctional by scoring on the extremes of both the cohesion and adaptability continua of the self-report FACES II questionnaire. Infant birthweight was regressed on length of gestation and other known biomedical, anthropometric, risk-behavior, and sociodemographic determinants, as well as family functioning. Women who perceived their families as dysfunctional were delivered of infants who weighed on the average 126.4 g (95% CI 37.4, 215.4) less than infants born to women from functional families (P = .0055), after adjusting for other known determinants. Family functioning also was found to modify the effects of prepregnancy weight and infant sex on infant birthweight.\r"

More than one patient attended 12% of the consultations, and more than one person, patient or nonpatient, was present at 36%. At 31% of the consultations children alone or children and adults were recorded as patients (child consultations), and at 69% only adult patients were present (adult consultations). Adults were recorded as second or third patients at 19% of the child consultations but at only 5% of the adult consultations. The child consultations alone yielded 86% of all the nonpatients documented. Basic terminology and methodology for investigating such multiple family member visits to family physicians is discussed as well as the composition of the different family units encountered and their possible significance.\r"

Illness severity was controlled in two ways: (1) by the study being focused on one diagnosis--mild to moderate hypertension, and (2) by concurrent chronic illnesses being enumerated and included in the analysis. Medical visits to the physician were examined over a 2-year period for 25 to 30 patients randomly sampled from each of the three payment mechanisms. Statistically significant differences were found for patient behaviors (total number of patient visits) and physician behaviors (number of medications and recommendations for revisits). The highest visit frequency was found for those on public assistance, followed closely by those covered by an HMO, and more distantly by those choosing fee-for-service. In a climate of cost consciousness, further study is needed to explore the impact of reimbursement mechanisms on the use of health care services.\r"

The survey response rate was 72.5% (757 questionnaires were returned out of a sample of 1044). Approximately 47% of respondents have cared for an HIV-infected patients. This percentage varied from a low of 31.4% in the Midwest to as high as 56.1% on the East Coast. Thirty-two percent of family physicians practicing in communities of fewer than 2500 have dealt with this illness, while 60% of those in communities of greater than 100,000 have done so. Seventy-seven percent of respondents are willing to provide care to HIV-infected individuals; 62.9% believe that physicians have a right to refuse to care for a patient because he or she is infected with the AIDS virus. Forty percent believe that they would lose patients if it were known that they were caring for an AIDS patient in their office. Finally, the vast majority of those surveyed favor required partner notification and would inform the sexual partner of an HIV-positive patient if the patient refused to do so.\r"

  ".W": "In the past few years rural hospitals have found obstetric care increasingly difficult to provide. A trend toward family physicians abandoning the practice of obstetrics has been a major obstacle for these hospitals. Malpractice cost and pressures, professional isolation, and inadequate training have all been cited as reasons that family physicians in rural areas have stopped delivering babies. Faced with a large number of women giving birth without prenatal care, a hospital in eastern Kentucky began a regional primary care obstetric unit to assure that obstetric care would be available to all patients who needed it. The hospital chose to staff the maternity center with family physicians so it could offer a family-centered obstetric program and newborn care. Since the opening of the maternity center in 1985, hospital deliveries have increased over 30%, while the percentage of patients who give birth without prenatal care has fallen from 3.0% to 0.7%. This report describes the factors behind the creation of the maternity center, its effect on the hospital, and its effect on the family physicians who serve on its staff.\r"

A study was undertaken to assess the impact of computer-generated reminders to adult patients, their physicians, or both patients and physicians on adherence to five recommended preventive services: cholesterol measurements, fecal occult blood testing, mammography, Papanicolaou smears, and tetanus immunization. During the academic year 1988-1989, all 7397 adult patients and their 49 physicians in a university family medicine clinical practice were randomized by practice group into one of four study groups: control, physician reminders, patient reminders, and both physician and patient reminders. Adherence was defined in community-oriented terms: the percentage of patients within each group who had received the preventive service in the recommended interval. During the study period, adherence to four of the five preventive services increased significantly, with the largest increases in the physician and patient reminder group: cholesterol measurements increased from 19.5% to 38.1%, fecal occult blood testing 9.3% to 27.0%, mammography 11.4% to 27.1%, and tetanus immunization 23.4% to 35.4% (for each increase, P less than .0001, McNemar's chi-square test). In general, increases were greater in blacks and in patients with any form of insurance coverage. Computer-based physician and patient reminder systems have great promise of improving adherence to preventive services in primary care settings.\r"

Vitreous humor (0.5 mL) was diluted 1:1 with water and applied through a filter onto a 3-cm preconcentration column. Following a simple wash step, the analytes were flushed directly onto a reversed-phase analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Absolute recoveries were high (above 90%) and the chromatograms were free from interference. Analysis for the drug and its breakdown product was performed using ultraviolet (UV) visible photodiode array detection, which allowed confirmation of peak identity. Recognizable UV spectra could be measured with as little as 20 ng on column. Comparison of the drug levels in 27 blood and vitreous humor samples showed that, while there was only a low correlation between the blood and vitreous concentrations (R = 0.70), vitreous cocaine and BE determinations were good indicators of antemortem cocaine use. In almost all cases, the vitreous BE concentrations were higher than the cocaine concentrations. The technique was easy to perform and the vitreous samples were especially compatible with this low-labor analytical procedure.\r"

By the enzymatic reaction of ChE, its substrate, benzoylcholine, produces choline, which is oxidized by choline oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide. HPPA is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase to become the fluorogenic dimer whose concentration is measured fluorometrically at an excitation emission wavelength of 320 nm and an elimination emission wavelength of 404 nm. The selectivity and sensitivity of the present method were found to be superior to those of conventional pH and spectrophotometric methods.\r"

Since breath-alcohol (BrAC) analysis is typically employed to determine BAC, there is often challenge to the use of an assumed 2100:1 conversion ratio. This concern may be relevant in light of considerable data that show a low percentage of cases in which BrAC greater than BAC, and this concern increases when the BrAC is used to predict BAC in the context of \"per se\" legislation. Probability theory provides a basis for estimating the likelihood of an individual having a BrAC greater than or equal to g/210 L with a corresponding BAC less than 0.10 g/100 mL. Actual field data from the state of Wisconsin (n = 404) were evaluated to determine the probability of this occurrence. The probability for this occurrence involves the multiplication law for independent events. The computed probability from the data was 0.018. The actual number of occurrences where BrAC greater than or equal to 0.10 g/210 L and BAC less than 0.10 g/100 mL was 5, resulting in a probability of 0.012. The concern of having BrAC greater than BAC at the critical \"per se\" level has a very low probability of occurrence, which thus supports the reasonableness of \"per se\" DWI legislation based upon a blood-alcohol standard determined by breath-alcohol analysis.\r"

Premortem, agonal, and postmortem events were reviewed in an attempt to account for differences in blood ethanol concentrations between sites. The agonal aspiration of vomitus having at least 0.80% w/v ethanol appears to be associated with an increase in aortic ethanol concentrations. We conclude that valid interpretation of postmortem ethanol concentrations must take into consideration the possible entry of ethanol into the pulmonary venous circulation via the respiratory system.\r"

For the phospholipids studied in lung lavages (phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and phosphatidyl glycerol) the proportions differed between the control group and the drowned group, and between the fresh-water and salt-water drowned animals. According to these results, the lipids we have analyzed can be employed as markers in forensic autopsies, where it is necessary to differentiate between death by drowning and postmortem immersion and between fresh-water and salt-water drowning. In lung tissue, only phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl inositol showed significative differences. These results also confirm that LSPs are strongly affected in drowning.\r"

Unfortunately, some people die an unnatural death, in particular, as the result of euthanasia. In contrast to the situation in most countries, in the Netherlands euthanasia is accepted by the courts under strict conditions. It can be very difficult for the legal authorities to establish whether a person has died from natural causes or from suicide, euthanasia, or murder. In addition to the pathologist and the lawyer, the toxicologist also has a number of problems in showing whether euthanasia has been carried out. These can consist of the following analytical problems: (a) interactions--the patients involved have frequently been receiving a large number of toxic and nontoxic drugs simultaneously; (b) identification--not all drugs administered are included in general screening procedures; (c) metabolites--a large number of metabolites may have accumulated toward the end of a long therapeutic regimen; and (d) determination--determination of quaternary muscle relaxants and their various metabolites, as well as other drugs, can be problematic. There are also toxicokinetic problems; because of poor kidney and liver function, low serum albumen, general malaise, and interactions between these factors and other drugs, the kinetics of a given drug can differ from normal. This makes it all the more difficult to determine whether the patient died from an accumulation of medication or from a so-called \"euthanetic\" drug mixture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The two quaternary amines of pancuronium appear to undergo pyrolytic N-demethylation in the injection port to yield an entity amenable to capillary column gas chromatography. The mass spectrum of the compound consists of a base peak of m/z 322, with additional fragments of 292, 323, 338, and 397 m/z, each of which was monitored.

Although variants of this disorder have been described in other cultures (e.g., dysmorphobia), the full spectrum appears to be confined to Japan. TKS can be understood as a pathological amplification of culture-specific concerns about the social presentation of self and the impact of improper conduct on the well-being of others. Both social interaction and constitutional vulnerability may contribute to the cognitive processes that underlie TKS. The salience of cultural differences for psychiatric nosology then depends on whether the clinical focus is on disordered biology, individual psychology and experience, or the social context of behavior. Any attempt to include cultural variation in psychiatric diagnoses must begin by making explicit the intended use of the classification because different social contexts and clinical goals demand alternative diagnostic schemes.\r"

Of 489 male veterans presenting for treatment, 10.7% had significant Vietnam combat-related PTSD symptoms as measured by the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD. Clinically significant PTSD symptoms occurred among 46% of the subsample of combat-exposed Vietnam veterans with substance abuse problems. Degree of combat exposure was the most important military stressor that distinguished Vietnam veterans with PTSD from those without PTSD, but the groups also differed on age of war zone duty, duration of war zone duty, and whether they were wounded. Veterans who served in Vietnam did not differ from veterans who had no war zone duty on various parameters of psychosocial adjustment. However, the subgroup of Vietnam veterans with PTSD symptoms reported significantly greater psychosocial adjustment problems than their counterparts who did not have PTSD. The deleterious effects associated with combat-related PTSD appeared to be confined to adjunctive psychiatric difficulties and unemployment and did not increase risk of arrests for antisocial conduct beyond that found for veterans without PTSD. Methodological and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

The findings support the hypothesis that a specific type of alteration in consciousness that enhances capacity for total attentional involvement (absorption) characterizes marijuana intoxication, and that this enhancement may act as a reinforcer, possibly influencing future use.\r"

The concept of post traumatic stress disorder is used to organize literature on psychiatric casualties resulting from massive psychic trauma, e.g., the Nazi Holocaust, the Vietnam and Israeli wars, and the current world epidemic of torture. Torture is a unique human made stressor resulting in category-specific diagnostic symptoms. Medical assessment can be complemented with photographs, x-rays, electroencephalograms, and sleep studies. Individual psychotherapy and group techniques focus on the issues of denial and trust, loss, survivor guilt, and reparation. Programs of psychological and social rehabilitation and treatment with benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and other compounds are reviewed. Future research needs include the conceptualization of the trauma of torture and its sequelae in broader terms, the application of standardized measurements to facilitate international comparisons, and the testing of various approaches to intervention in an experimental design. An ethical physician must resist the pressures of totalitarian governments to assume neutrality in the presence of human rights violations affecting his/her patients.\r"

Even after lengthy formalin fixation, the methods permit the localization of anterogradely degenerated tracts in a variety of fiber systems in the brains of patients who died between five and 20 months after the onset of neurological symptoms. Particularly the polarizing technique, because of its simplicity, can be added to the usual neuropathological methods for demonstrating the long-distance effects of a brain lesion. As research tools, these methods would also aid in the study of the anatomical substrate of human neurological symptomatology.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to assess whether development of the central nervous system (CNS) is delayed in victims of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We selected the parameter of myelination because it is a continuously changing and readily accessible marker of CNS development in the SIDS age-range. We assessed myelination blindly in 61 SIDS and 89 autopsy controls. In 62 sites the degree of myelination was visually graded in myelin-stained histological sections on an ordinal scale of 0-4 using the inferior cerebellar peduncle as an internal standard of degree 3. Cases were stratified by postconceptional age at death and SIDS and controls were compared with respect to myelin degree at each site. Significantly delayed myelination (p less than 0.05) occurred in the SIDS group in 25 of the 62 sites examined. Hypomyelination affected fiber systems in which myelination is initiated before or after birth and which myelinate with different tempos and preferentially affect pyramidal and cerebellar (somatomotor) and prefrontal-temporal-limbic (visceromotor) systems. Hypomyelination was not associated with individual clinicopathologic variables in the SIDS group. Somatic growth and brain weight were significantly greater in SIDS than controls. Therefore, we suggest that SIDS is associated with a developmental CNS disorder. Although delayed CNS myelination most likely shares a common antecedent with sudden death and is not its cause, the role of somato- and viscero-motor systems in central cardiorespiratory control and arousal warrants further analysis in SIDS.\r"

DNA synthesis was assessed by measuring the fluorescence intensity of FITC-conjugated antibody to bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). The two parameters were correlated to determine the location of BrdUrd-incorporating cells within the cell cycle. Exposure of astrocytes to MTX caused a consistent increase in number of cells in S-phase which correlated with the increase in BrdUrd incorporation. These studies provide supportive evidence that the astrogliosis seen in MTX encephalopathy may be due to a primary involvement of astrocytes.\r"

We found no overall differences among pedigrees in total densities of NFT and SP, but statistical analyses disclosed that an uncommon type of SP was disproportionately present in two pedigrees. This type of SP was usually restricted to CA4, had a marked amyloid core devoid of argyrophilic neurites.

  ".W": "A phase I study with continuous infusion carboplatin for 21 days every 6 weeks using a venous access port and portable pump was performed over a dose range of 12 to 32 mg/m2/d, with increments of 2 mg/m2/d. Forty-four patients received 107 courses (median, two; range, one to nine). World Health Organization (WHO) grade III/IV leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in one of seven patients at 30 mg/m2/d, and in two of six and four of six patients at 32 mg/m2/d. Cumulative platelet depression was found at dose levels of 28 mg/m2/d or more. Median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow, monitored by radioisotope clearances at doses greater than or equal to 20 mg/m2/d, decreased 8.2% (P less than .05) and 10.9% (P less than .01) after two courses. There was a relationship (r = .50, P less than .0002) between the percentage of platelet depression and GFR. No other toxicity was observed. Of the 17 patients who were evaluable, one complete response and four partial responses were observed. In addition, six patients had stable disease. Pharmacokinetic analysis of total and ultrafiltrable platinum (UFPt) was performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Steady-state plasma levels for UFPt were reached after 8 hours. These levels could be detected from the 20 mg/m2/d dose. During steady state, carboplatin dose and UFPt plasma levels were not correlated, but steady-state UFPt and GFR (r = -.27, P less than .05) were. Twenty-four percent of total platinum (Pt) was present as UFPt during steady state (x = 160 +/- 10 micrograms/L). Total body clearance of UFPt exceeded GFR 2.2 times. Mean area under the curve (AUC) for UFPt during continuous infusion was 4,921.8 +/- 301.72 mg.min/L. For total Pt, steady-state plasma levels were not reached; total Pt plasma levels increased between day 7 and day 21 (P less than .0001). There was a significant relation between total Pt serum levels day 7, 14, and 21 and the drug dose administered. Immunohistochemical analysis of DNA-bound Pt in leukocytes showed a linear increase from day 7 to day 14 to day 21 (r = .97) between DNA-bound Pt and duration of infusion in individual patients. The maximum-tolerable dose of carboplatin is 30 mg/m2/d for 21 days (total dose 630 mg/m2) and is recommended for phase II studies.\r"

Although 65.7% of the patients were successfully resuscitated, only 12 (10.5%) were discharged alive from the hospital. Median survival after discharge was 150 days. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the only variable predicting the likelihood of a patient's being discharged alive after a CPA was the performance status of the patient at the time of admission to the hospital. Thus, a patient spending more than 50% of the time in bed at the time of admission had only a 2.3% chance of being discharged alive after CPA. A thorough discussion of these findings between physicians and patients and their families is strongly recommended at the time of admission to spare cancer patients unnecessary invasive resuscitative procedures.\r"

For such clinical trials, the question of when to perform the randomization is often difficult. Conventional statistical wisdom prescribes that randomization should take place as late as possible before treatment is effected. This is not always possible or desirable, however. In this report, we describe the factors that are influenced by the timing of randomization, quantify how timing affects these factors, and attempt to provide a tool to help investigators and statisticians determine the appropriate time to randomize for individual studies and particular circumstances.\r"

  ".U": "91086948\r", 
  ".W": "From April 1984 to December 1987, the French Pediatric Oncology Society (SFOP) organized a randomized trial for advanced-stage B-cell lymphoma without CNS involvement to study the possibility of reducing the length of treatment to 4 months. After receiving the same three intensive six-drug induction courses based on high-dose fractionated cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate (HD MTX), and cytarabine in continuous infusion, patients were evaluated for remission. Those who achieved complete remission (CR) were randomized between a long arm (five additional courses with two additional drugs; 16 weeks of treatment) and a short arm (two additional courses; 5 weeks). For patients in partial remission (PR), intensification of treatment was indicated. Two hundred sixteen patients were registered: 15 stage II nasopharyngeal and extensive facial tumors, 167 stage III, and 34 stage IV, 20 of the latter having more than 25% blast cells in bone marrow. The primary sites of involvement were abdomen in 172, head and neck in 30, thorax in two, and other sites in 12. One hundred sixty-seven patients are alive in first CR with a minimum follow-up of 18 months; four are lost to follow-up. Eight patients died from initial treatment failure, 14 died from toxicity or deaths unrelated to tumor or treatment, and 27 relapsed. The event-free survival (EFS), with a median follow-up of 38 months, is 78% (SE 3) for all the patients, 73% (SE 11) for the stage II patients, 80% (SE 3) for the stage III patients, and 68% (SE 8) for the stage IV and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. One hundred sixty-six patients were randomized: 82 in the short arm and 84 in the long arm. EFS is, respectively, 89% and 87%. Statistical analysis confirms equivalence of both treatment arms with regard to EFS. Moreover, morbidity was lower in the short arm. This study confirms the high survival rate obtained in the previous LMB 0281 study without radiotherapy or debulking surgery and demonstrates the effectiveness of short treatment.\r"

We also wished to test the feasibility of rapidly cycling Cytoxan and high-dose ara-C based on signs of early marrow recovery. Twenty patients including 12 with stage III Burkitt's lymphoma and eight with stage IV Burkitt's lymphoma or B-cell ALL were entered onto this pilot study. The rate of complete remission was 95%. Four patients have relapsed. The 2-year actuarial EFS was 75% (median follow-up, 37 months). Two of the initial five patients developed transverse myelitis, which we believe may have been secondary to the concomitant administration of intrathecal (IT) and high-dose systemic ara-C. We conclude that this short but intensive regimen is highly effective for patients with advanced Burkitt's lymphoma and B-cell ALL. EFS has improved over previous less intensive regimens, and is comparable to regimens of longer duration.\r"

  ".W": "Teniposide (VM-26) can increase intracellular methotrexate (MTX) and its polyglutamate derivatives in vitro and thus has the potential to improve the therapeutic index of regimens containing MTX. In this phase II study, children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second marrow relapse were randomly assigned to receive either simultaneous (n = 11) or sequential (n = 12) continuous infusions of MTX and VM-26 prior to reinduction. Infusions of VM-26 were begun 12 hours after completion of MTX infusion in the sequential group. Dosages were individually adjusted to maintain plasma concentration levels of 10 microns for MTX and 15 microns for VM-26; total infusion times were 24 and 72 hours, respectively. Significant toxicity in the first six patients who received the scheduled 72-hour VM-26 infusion (including one drug-related death) prompted a 50% reduction in infusion duration. The reduced dose was associated with similar but more manageable toxicity. Examination of bone marrow aspirates 10 days after therapy was begun showed one complete and two partial marrow remissions; a fourth patient who had an aplastic marrow on day 10 received no further chemotherapy and had a complete remission (CR) documented on day 31. There was no obvious clinical advantage associated with either infusion schedule, although small sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions. The 17% response rate to the MTX/VM-26 therapeutic window in patients with refractory disease suggests the need for further investigation to evaluate alternative schedules and concomitant therapy for this drug combination.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively compared neuropsychologic functioning and clinical indicators of neurotoxicity in 49 consecutive childhood leukemia patients in long-term continuous complete remission (CR) who had received two different regimens of CNS prophylaxis by random assignment. Twenty-three patients were treated with 1,800 cGy cranial radiation and intrathecal methotrexate (RT group) and 26 with parenteral methotrexate only (MTX group). Over half of the RT group had somnolence syndrome, and four developed cerebral calcifications late in their clinical course. Abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs) were seen in 15 patients in the MTX group, and six had early, transient white-matter hypodensities apparent on computed tomographic (CT) scans. Mean scores on standard tests of intelligence and academic achievement, administered after remission induction and again at a median of 6 years after treatment cessation, did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, statistically significant decreases in overall and verbal intelligence quotients (IQs) and in arithmetic achievement were found within both treatment groups. Sixteen of 26 in the MTX group and 14 of the 23 in the RT group had clinically important decreases (greater than or equal to 15 points) on one or more neuropsychologic measures. These changes did not correlate with findings on CT scans, EEGs, or other clinical signs of neurotoxicity. We conclude that 1,800 cGy cranial radiation and parenteral methotrexate, as used in this study, are associated with comparable decreases in neuropsychologic function.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a pilot protocol at seven Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) institutions to examine the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of using a common regimen of high-dose chemoradiotherapy (HD CT/RT) supported by autologous or allogeneic marrow infusions in children with metastatic neuroblastoma (NBL) in first or second remission. During a 57-month period, we accrued 101 patients. We report here results for the 81 who completed treatment at least 2 years ago. The HD CT/RT regimen consisted of melphalan 60 mg/m2/d for three doses, and total body irradiation (TBI) either 1.5 Gy (n = 27) or 2.0 Gy (n = 54) twice daily for six doses. Twenty-three patients also received irradiation consisting of 1.2 Gy twice daily for 10 doses to persisting disease sites. Seventy-four were given autologous and seven allogeneic marrow, 64 autologous marrows being purged immunomagnetically. Fifty-four children were in first complete (CR) or partial (PR) remission and 27 in second CR or PR. As of October 1, 1990, follow-up was from 32 to 72 months. Forty-seven of these 81 children relapsed, 10 died of complications, one of unknown cause, and 23 continue in remission, including 21 of the 54 treated in first remission, and 16 who completed treatment more than 3 years ago. The 2-year actuarial event-free survival (EFS) probabilities are first CR (CR1) 32% (SE 10%), first PR (PR1) 43% (SE 9%), second CR (CR2) 33% (SE 27%), and second PR (PR2) 5% (SE 5%). Probability of EFS correlated with remission number (first better than second, P less than .001), with interval from diagnosis to HD CT/RT (greater than 9 months better than less than 9 months, P = .055), and with TBI dose (12 Gy better than 9 Gy, P = .031). These encouraging results may partly reflect selection for this treatment of patients with NBL who have a slower disease pace.\r"

  ".U": "91086953\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical and histopathologic features are often inadequate for accurate prediction of relapse or survival of individual patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). We therefore studied the cellular DNA content (ploidy) of RMS cells in relation to histology and response to therapy in 37 patients with unresectable tumors. Using flow cytometric techniques, we found that about one third of patients had diploid tumor stem lines, regardless of the histologic subtype. In the group with abnormal ploidy, a hyperdiploid classification (1.10 to 1.80 times the DNA content of normal diploid cells) was exclusively associated with embryonal histology (P = .001). By contrast, near-tetraploidy (1.80 to 2.60 times the DNA content of normal cells) was strongly associated with alveolar histology (P = .001). Thus, in these histologic subtypes of RMS, abnormal ploidy appears to arise through different mechanisms. Tumor-cell ploidy had a significant impact on survival that was especially apparent in patients with unresectable, nonmetastatic (group III) tumors. In this subgroup, hyperdiploidy conferred the best prognosis and diploidy the worst (P less than .0001). None of the eight patients with diploid tumors survived for more than 18 months. Tumor-cell ploidy was the best predictor of treatment outcome for patients with either embryonal (P less than .001; relative risk, 25.5) or alveolar (P = .073; relative risk 7.1) RMS and contributed significantly after adjustment for disease stage and anatomic site. Patients with unresectable diploid RMS have an unacceptably high risk of treatment failure, justifying new therapeutic approaches for this distinct subgroup.\r"

This retrospective evaluation of 34 patients suggests a clinical course very similar to that of renal Wilms' tumor. While clinical presentation varies according to the extrarenal localization, investigations to determine the size of the primary tumor (T), regional lymph node involvement (N), and the occurrence of distant metastasis (M) are very similar, ie, chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound (US), and computed axial tomographic (CAT) scan of the abdomen and chest. Stage grouping according to the pathologic TNM classification showed stage I in 30%, stage II in 10%, stage IIIa in 34%, stage IIIb in 23%, and stage IVa in 3%; four patients could not be staged. Evaluation of therapy and survival indicate the need for postoperative chemotherapy (CT) to all patients, while the same data suggest that the drugs used for renal Wilms' tumor are equally effective for extrarenal Wilms' tumor. Radiotherapy (RT) probably should be reserved for those patients with unresectable gross residual disease and for metastatic disease. The radiation dose used in the reviewed cases varied from 2,000 to 5,000 cGy. However, recent experience suggests that high doses are not justified in renal Wilms' tumor. The estimated overall 2-year survival of the 34 patients is 82% (95% confidence interval, 63% to 92%).\r"

It is associated with multidrug resistance in laboratory systems and has recently been found in human tumors associated with in vitro and clinical drug resistance. We used an immunohistochemical method employing two monoclonal antibodies, JSB-1 and C-219, to detect expression of P-glycoprotein in lymphoma patients. One of 42 newly diagnosed and untreated lymphoma patients (2%) and seven of 11 previously treated and drug-resistant patients (64%) had detectable levels of P-glycoprotein (P less than .001). Based on prior reports suggesting that verapamil sensitizes drug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy by competitive inhibition of the P-glycoprotein, we tested the efficacy of verapamil as a chemosensitizer in 18 patients with drug-refractory disease. All patients had previously failed or relapsed within 3 months of a doxorubicin-vincristine-containing drug regimen. Patients received day-1 cyclophosphamide, and 4-day continuous infusion doxorubicin and vincristine and oral dexamethasone (CVAD). CVAD was combined with 5-day continuous infusion verapamil given at maximally tolerated dose. Overall, 13 of 18 patients (72%) responded to treatment including five complete remissions (CRs; 28%). The median duration of response was 200 days and median survival was 242 days. The dose-limiting toxicity of the verapamil infusion was temporary cardiac dysfunction including hypotension, congestive heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmia. We conclude that the P-glycoprotein is uncommonly expressed in untreated lymphomas and frequently expressed in clinically drug-resistant disease, and that chemotherapy using CVAD plus maximally tolerated doses of verapamil results in a high response rate in patients carefully selected for clinical drug resistance.\r"

The mechanism of cytotoxic action of the compound appears to involve metabolic conversion to the active triphosphate. Fludarabine phosphate has substantial activity against lymphoid malignancies, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Its single-agent activity in CLL appears at least comparable to those of other conventional combination regimens. Its activity in Hodgkin's disease, mycosis fungoides, and macroglobulinemia, although suggestive, needs to be further defined and clinical trials are warranted in hairy cell leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia, and previously untreated myeloma. The compound does not appear active against most common solid tumors. Early clinical trials indicated significant myelosuppression and the potential for severe neurotoxicity. Toxicity on the currently used low-dose schedules includes transient and reversible myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence/fatigue, and elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum creatinine. Possible pulmonary toxicity has been suggested in several patients. The currently used low-doses of fludarabine phosphate, even with repeated administration, are well tolerated and appear safe with a negligible risk for severe neurotoxicity. Based on its single-agent activity and tolerability, the Food and Drug Administration recently granted group C designation of the drug for the treatment of patients with refractory CLL outside the clinical trials setting. The use of fludarabine phosphate in combination regimens and its impact on the natural history of the lymphoid malignancies is yet to be determined. Fludarabine phosphate may well occupy a pivotal role in the management of CLL and low-grade NHL.\r"

Co-trimoxazole two double-strength tablets orally twice daily throughout the period of treatment was added to the ProMACE-CytaBOM regimen when an increased risk of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was found in the first 35 patients receiving this combination. Median follow-up is 5 years. Among the 99 patients treated with ProMACE-MOPP, 73 achieved a complete remission (CR) (74%), 30 complete responders have relapsed (41%), and 45 patients have died (45%), including two (2%) of treatment-related causes. Among the 94 patients treated with ProMACE-CytaBOM, 81 achieved a CR (86%), 22 complete responders have relapsed (27%), and 31 patients have died (33%). The complete response rate (P2 = .048) and survival (P2 = .046) were significantly higher for patients treated with ProMACE-CytaBOM. The mortality of ProMACE-CytaBOM treatment overall was six of 94 patients (6.4%). There was no treatment-related mortality among patients treated with prophylactic co-trimoxazole (n = 59). ProMACE-CytaBOM combination chemotherapy with co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is a safe and effective treatment for patients with aggressive histology malignant lymphoma and is superior to ProMACE-MOPP.\r"

We report on the effectiveness of continuous infusion CBDCA, 300 mg/m2/d x 5 days, as evaluated in nine patients with secondary acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) (seven previous myelodysplastic syndrome and two treatment-associated ANLL), three ANLL patients in first relapse, six refractory ANLL, and nine patients with blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (BP-CML). All patients were considered assessable. The response rate was 44% (eight complete remissions [CRs], four partial remissions [PRs]). Median duration of postchemotherapy neutropenia was 36 days (range, 18 to 45). Therapy was well tolerated, and toxicity was mainly hematologic and nondose-limiting. Despite prolonged neutropenia, severe infections were rarely seen, and most patients were managed as outpatients. Twelve patients had nausea and vomiting, two had symptomatic hypomagnesemia, and one patient showed reversible ototoxicity. Because of substantial antileukemic activity and unusual extrahematologic toxicity, CBDCA appears to be an effective second-line agent in the treatment of ANLL and should be considered for upgrading to first-line treatment regimens.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the high response rates resulting from chemotherapy, the majority of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients relapse with chemoresistant tumors. To analyze the phenotypic changes that are precursors of chemoresistant status, and to investigate the role of chemotherapy in these changes, tumor samples from 20 patients, taken before chemotherapy (etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) and again at the onset of chemoresistance (after at least three courses of chemotherapy), were compared. The histologic changes were minor in 10 of 20 patients, as shown by an increase in cell size; they were major in 10 of 20 patients, with the appearance of mixed composite tumors in which neuroendocrine (NE), epidermoid, and glandular components were mixed. Major changes correlated with a good response to chemotherapy (P = .001). Ultrastructural studies showed an increase in neurosecretory granules and desmosomes, and a high frequency of multidirectional differentiation (45%) when comparison was made with pretherapy samples (10%) (P less than .01). Immunohistochemical (IH) analysis showed an increase in cytokeratin (CK) expression in treated patients, with a different labeling pattern and the expression of higher molecular weight CK. The expression of NE lineage markers (Leu 19, Sy 38, SL 11-14) remained stable, while that of NE differentiation markers (Leu 7, chromogranin) increased in the treated patients. The neuron-specific enolase (NSE) activity remained stable in treated SCLC. Large cells with a more differentiated phenotype and proliferative capacity (as shown by Ki 67 labeling), appeared to be characteristic of treated and secondary chemoresistant SCLC. The acquisition of a more complex phenotype, which correlates with primary response to therapy, implies a drug-induced differentiation in SCLC.\r"

  ".U": "91086966\r", 
  ".W": "The combination of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (CEB) was evaluated as initial chemotherapy in 76 patients with good-prognosis metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) between 1984 and 1988. The classification of eligible patients included Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) stages IM, IIA, IIB, IIC, IIIA, IIIB, IV0ABCL1, and IV0ABL2. Four courses of combination chemotherapy were administered in a 21-day cycle, and surgical excision of residual mass was performed in 27 cases (23 laparotomies and four thoracotomies). At the time of analysis, median follow-up was 24 months from start of chemotherapy (range, 6 to 54 months). The 2-year cause-specific survival probability was 98.5%, the single cause-related mortality being caused by bleomycin pneumonitis. Five patients failed CEB chemotherapy, but all have been successfully salvaged with a combination of surgery and intensive chemotherapy, follow-up from completion of all treatment being 35 to 44 months. The toxicity of CEB included bone marrow suppression and alopecia in all patients but no significant neurotoxicity or ototoxicity, and minimal renal toxicity. Only four (5%) patients had a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate greater than 15%. In 51% of patients, the hemoglobin fell below 10 g/dL. The WBC count nadir was less than 1,500/microL in 11% of treatment cycles and in 16% the platelet nadir fell below 50,000/microL. Decreases in the WBC and platelet counts were of very brief duration. Only one of 310 CEB cycles was complicated by neutropenic sepsis, and there were no episodes of thrombocytopenic purpura or bleeding. We conclude that the CEB combination represents an effective alternative to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in good-prognosis NSGCT and that the replacement of cisplatin by carboplatin leads to reduced toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to assess the preferred methods of treatment of breast cancer by American oncologists, and the impact of clinical trials on their practice. We mailed 465 questionnaires to surgical, radiation, or medical oncologists. The questionnaire described five hypothetic patients with breast cancer, and respondents were asked to select their preferred treatment for each patient. For primary breast cancer, most physicians would offer the choice of local excision followed by radiation therapy or modified radical mastectomy. About 80% of physicians would prescribe adjuvant chemotherapy for a premenopausal woman with estrogen receptor-negative, axillary node negative breast cancer, and for a postmenopausal woman with estrogen receptor-negative, node-positive disease. This policy was favored by male and female physicians of each specialty. Almost all respondents would treat a young woman with inflammatory breast cancer with initial chemotherapy followed by radiation and/or surgery, and about 60% would recommend chemotherapy to a postmenopausal patient with estrogen receptor-negative disease and minimally symptomatic bone metastases. Clinical trials have compared treatment strategies that could be applied to patients described in our questionnaire. Preferred treatments for primary breast cancer, and for inflammatory breast cancer are supported by the results of clinical trials. Recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy for node-negative breast cancer is not based on a consistent demonstration of improvement in survival, although randomized trials with short follow-up have shown delay to recurrence. Recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy for a postmenopausal woman with node-positive breast cancer is contrary to the results of large randomized controlled trials (and to a meta-analysis), which have shown that this policy does not lead to improved survival. Our report suggests that even large randomized clinical trials may have a minimal impact on practice if their results run counter to belief in the value of the treatment.\r"

  ".W": "This is a Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) prospective randomized trial of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB) versus vinblastine, cisplatin, and etoposide (VP-16) (VPV) in the treatment of advanced germ cell tumors of the testis. The study objective was to determine what effect the replacement of bleomycin with VP-16 has on complete response (CR), survival, and drug toxicity. One hundred sixty-nine patients were registered and randomized. Of these patients, 160 were assessable for response. All had histologically confirmed disseminated germ cell neoplasms of testicular origin. Forty-six had minimal metastatic disease, and 114 had maximal disease. Seventy-seven were randomized to PVB and 83 to VPV chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in pretreatment characteristics between the two arms with regard to tumor burden, histologic type, and overall performance status. Patients received four courses of induction chemotherapy, either PVB (cisplatin 120 mg/m2 day 3, vinblastine 12 mg/m2 day 1, bleomycin 15 U/m2 twice per week) or VPV (vinblastine 8 mg/m2 day 1, cisplatin 120 mg/m2 day 3, VP-16 50 mg/m2 days 2 to 5). Chemotherapy was given every 3 weeks. Cytoreductive surgery was done postinduction if a chemotherapy CR was not achieved. There was no difference in the percentage of patients achieving a disease-free status between PVB (77%) and VPV (73%). The mean leukocyte nadir was similar for both treatments, but the mean platelet nadir was significantly lower (P = .003) in the VPV arm. All bleomycin-related toxicities (pulmonary, mucositis, skin) were avoided in the VPV arm. We conclude that bleomycin can be replaced in first-line therapy for advanced germ cell tumors without sacrificing efficacy and with the advantage of avoiding unnecessary drug toxicity.\r"

  ".U": "91086970\r", 
  ".W": "We designed an ex vivo bone marrow treatment for breast cancer patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support (ABMS), using 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC), an active derivative of cyclophosphamide with known activity against breast cancer. This phase I bone marrow purging trial used ficoll-separated mononuclear cells (MNC) (devoid of granulocytes and RBCs), as opposed to the buffy coat. Twenty-five patients with metastatic breast cancer were studied. Patients received three cycles of the Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), fluorouracil, and methotrexate (Duke AFM) regimen, followed by marrow harvest. An MNC fraction of marrow was prepared and treated with 4-HC in concentrations of 20 micrograms/mL (four patients), 40 micrograms/mL (four patients), 60 micrograms/mL (nine patients), or 80 micrograms/mL (eight patients) and cryopreserved. Patients then received high-dose systemic cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine, followed by infusion of the purged marrow. The study end point was marrow engraftment, defined as WBC count greater than 1,000 cells per microliter. At the first three dose levels (20, 40, and 60 micrograms/mL 4-HC), there was no significant delay in time to engraftment (19, 20, and 23 days, respectively) compared with the unpurged historical controls (17 days). At 80 micrograms/mL, engraftment was significantly delayed compared with the lower concentrations (P = .027), and further escalation of 4-HC was not attempted. A significant correlation was observed between the time of leukocyte engraftment and the 4-HC concentration (P = .017). With a methylcellulose-based tissue culture assay, we demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) content in the purged marrow and the days to engraftment. Ninety-five percent of patients responded clinically to the entire program, 55% of them completely. Longer follow-up is required to assess the ultimate benefit of intensive therapy on long-term survival.\r"

Lv was given by constant intravenous (IV) infusion at 500 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 6, while FUDR was given by IV push, days 2 to 6, at 3:00 PM daily with doses ranging from 294 to 1,214 mg/m2/d. This program was well tolerated with dose-limiting toxicities of diarrhea and stomatitis, while hematologic toxicity was minimal. Eighty-two percent of the assessable patients (46 of 56) had failed at least one chemotherapy regimen. One complete remission lasting 9 months and 10 partial remissions ranging from 5 to 10 months were observed in this heavily pretreated patient population for an overall response rate of 20%. These data suggest that the combination therapy with Lv and FUDR may have clinical use. Because of differing patient sensitivity to this drug combination, the recommended dose of FUDR for the initial therapy cycle is 500 mg/m2/d, days 2 to 6, with subsequent escalation to 900 mg/m2/d in those patients without extreme sensitivity. Phase II studies are now in progress with these doses.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary (n-3) fatty acids would affect mammary tumor growth and metastasis. Weanling female BALB/c mice were fed diets that contained 10% corn oil (CO), linseed oil (LO) or a fish oil-corn oil mix (FO) for 3-8 wk prior to receiving subcutaneous injections of one of two syngeneic mammary tumor cell types (410 and 410.4). Tumor growth was assessed by monitoring mean tumor diameter and tumor weight upon removal. Feeding LO, but not FO, reduced the growth (p less than 0.05) of 410.4 mammary tumors compared with growth in those fed CO. Metastasis data paralleled the tumor growth rate. Feeding LO and FO enhanced (p less than 0.005) incorporation of (n-3) fatty acids into tumors. Tumor prostaglandin E (PGE) production was reduced (p less than 0.005) by LO and FO, compared with CO. FO feeding reduced 410.4 tumor PGE synthesis more (p less than 0.05) than LO feeding, yet tumor growth was only inhibited by LO. These data suggest an inhibitory effect of dietary linolenic acid [i.e., 18:3 (n-3)] on mammary tumor growth and metastasis. However, this effect did not directly correlate with diet-induced changes in PGE synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Because transthyretin (TTR) is a tryptophan-rich molecule and a sensitive nutritional marker, tryptophan deficiency might markedly influence the circulating level of TTR. The effect of severe tryptophan (Trp) deficiency on serum TTR, as well as on albumin and transferrin levels, was studied in growing rats for 8 d. The animals were then refed a control diet for 12 d. The Trp-deficient and control diets contained 0.008 and 0.34% Trp, respectively. A loss of body weight and a dramatic reduction in food intake were observed in the Trp-deficient rats. Although serum total Trp concentration was significantly less in these rats than in pair-fed controls, serum TTR declined to the same extent in both groups compared to control rats fed ad libitum. Albumin concentrations were not altered, but transferrin levels declined slightly in the Trp-deficient rats compared to both the pair-fed group and the controls fed ad libitum. Refeeding the control diet to Trp-deficient rats restored total and free Trp concentrations, as well as TTR and transferrin levels, but body weight and food intake remained lower than in the control group. To examine the effect of moderate Trp restriction, rats were fed for 2 wk a diet whose Trp content was 50% less than that of the control diet. Although total and free Trp concentrations were significantly lower in the rats fed the Trp-deficient diet than in the control group, body weight, food intake and TTR levels were similar in both groups. The results suggest that acute and severe Trp deficiency per se does not modify TTR and albumin levels.\r"

  ".W": "The role of adrenal function in the anorectic response and adaptation of rats to a diet with an isoleucine (Ile) imbalance was investigated. In the first of four experiments, rats were fed a mildly Ile-imbalanced diet after treatment with metyrapone, and inhibitor of glucocorticoid synthesis. In two separate experiments, rats were presented with either a mildly or severely Ile-imbalanced diet (4.93 and 9.86% imbalanced amino acid mixture, respectively) after bilateral adrenalectomy. Finally, the effects of ICS 205-930, a serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, on the intake of mildly Ile-imbalanced diet were tested in adrenalectomized animals. In each experiment a 2 X 2 factorial design was used. Neither metyrapone nor adrenalectomy altered the initial depression in the intake of an imbalanced diet. The adaptation phase in the response of adrenalectomized rats fed a mildly Ile-imbalanced diet was not different from that of controls, but adrenalectomized rats fed severely Ile-imbalanced diets were unable to adapt. Adrenalectomy did not alter the anti-anoretic activity of ICS 205-930 in this model. These results suggest that adrenal hormones are not necessary for the initial anoretic response or adaptation of rats to an Ile-imbalanced diet, nor are they implicated in the anti-anorectic effect of serotonin-3 blockade.\r"

Food supply was restricted to 15 g daily. As compared to casein, plant proteins induced significantly lower concentrations of plasma total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The plasma cholesterol increase associated with aging was not prevented by consumption of casein, soybean or potato protein, but wheat gluten seemed to be effective. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity was not significantly different in rats of the same age fed different plant proteins, whereas the esterification rate was lower in rats fed casein. With aging the LCAT activity generally decreased. As compared to the casein groups, the rats fed plant proteins showed higher excretion of fecal neutral and acidic steroids. Among the groups fed plant proteins, the fecal output of steroids was variable. Significantly negative correlations were found between fecal total sterol excretion and plasma total cholesterol or HDL cholesterol, respectively. Plant proteins showed a faster migration rate in the stomach, whereas their migration and absorption were slower in the first half of the small intestine. A relation between nonabsorbed nitrogen-containing substances and sterol excretion was hypothesized.\r"

Folate concentrations of carcass, liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, kidney, spleen, testes, heart and lung from rats fed the folate-free diet were 0.06 +/- 0.01, 0.73 +/- 0.08, 0.05 +/- 0.01, 0.39 +/- 0.01, 0.05 +/- 0.01, 0.17 +/- 0.01, 0.02 +/- 0.01 and 0.02 +/- 0.01 micrograms/g, respectively. Serum and erythrocyte concentrations and total body stores were 0.88 +/- 0.16 ng/mL, 0.30 +/- 0.01 micrograms/mL and 13.9 +/- 0.7 micrograms, respectively.

Carcass content dropped to 38% whereas liver content increased to 44% in rats fed the highest dietary level. Tissue concentrations were correlated with one another and with dietary folate levels. Under these experimental conditions total body folate could be predicted from serum folate, but the general applicability of this relationship requires further study.\r"

Growth, liver folate and serum folate of depleted rats that were fed test foods incorporated into a folate-free, amino acid-based diet were standardized against similar responses of rats fed known amounts of folic acid incorporated into the same diet. Bioavailability of folate of cooked broccoli, refried beans and orange juice concentrate in experiment 1 was 80-89, 113 and 62%, respectively, based on growth response; in experiment 2, values for cooked and raw broccoli, cooked cabbage and cantaloupe were 95, 103, 74 and 81%, respectively. The results demonstrate that in addition to serum and liver folate concentrations, growth may be a useful response criterion to evaluate the bioavailability of folates in foods. Further research is needed to determine the relevance of these bioavailability estimates to human nutrition.\r"

Treatments were control, 12 g/d of nicotinic acid or 12 g/d of nicotinamide. Periods were 14 d long; d 1 to 4 served as an adaptation period before treatment administration commenced (d 5 to 14). Effects of supplemental niacin on plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations and plasma glucose concentrations were tested following saline injection on d 10. Blood was then sampled for 5.5 h at 15-min intervals. On d 13, cows were treated similarly except that epinephrine replaced saline. The area below d-10 curves was subtracted from the area below d-13 curves to serve as an indicator of niacin's effect on plasma NEFA and glucose concentration responses to epinephrine injection. Niacin treatments did not change the area differences for plasma glucose compared to the control treatment; however, there was a trend for niacin to reduce the area difference compared to the control treatment for plasma NEFA. Niacin treatments did not alter dry matter intake, nutrient digestibility, milk yield or composition. Niacin supplementation increased the number of entodinia protozoa in rumen fluid.\r"

In addition, we have tentatively identified and quantified 13-cis-lutein and 13-cis-zeaxanthin in human plasma. The latter two cis isomers are also apparent in samples of two common food items, spinach and corn meal. We have analyzed the ratios of all of the members of the beta, beta family of carotenoids (zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin and beta-carotene) to their corresponding beta, epsilon structural isomers (lutein, alpha-cryptoxanthin and alpha-carotene) in human plasma. There are marked differences in these ratios, with beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin predominating in the carotene and monohydroxy-xanthophyll classes and lutein predominating in the dihydroxy-xanthophyll class. These differences could be attributable to dietary intake or to specific mechanisms in the way humans absorb and utilize these compounds.\r"

The xanthophylls, lutein, zeaxanthin, alpha-cryptoxanthin, and beta-cryptoxanthin, were the principal carotenoids in both the diet and the plasma. Lutein and zeaxanthin were abundant in the all-trans, the 9-cis, and the 13-cis geometrical isomers in the diet, but the 9-cis form was rarely measurable in plasma. However, the 13-cis isomers of lutein and zeaxanthin were found in higher proportions in plasma than in the diet. For both the monohydroxy-xanthophylls, alpha-cryptoxanthin and beta-cryptoxanthin, and the dihydroxy-xanthophylls, lutein and zeaxanthin, the beta, beta structural isomer (beta-cryptoxanthin or zeaxanthin) is less abundant than the beta, epsilon isomer in plasma than in the diet. These results indicate substantial specificity in the absorption or retention of closely related carotenoid isomers in primates. The proportions of different geometrical isomers of lutein and zeaxanthin in the plasma of both species of monkeys were nearly identical and were similar to human values. The hydrocarbon carotenoids, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene were usually undetectable in monkey plasma. The monkeys appear to be like humans in their utilization of lutein and zeaxanthin but distinctly different in some other aspects of carotenoid utilization.\r"

Incomplete equilibration of tracer occurred with the micellar casein fraction of all milks. The least equilibration with micellar casein was found with premature infant formula, for which the ratio of slopes of the equilibration lines (whey/casein) was 8.5/1. These differences may be due to Ca-casein binding in cow's milk-based formulas. The effects of the lack of tracer equilibration in vivo cannot be determined.

ELC5 myoblasts (a subclone of rat L6 cells) were proliferated in culture (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 degrees C) to confluency and then allowed to differentiate to form myotubes. Myotubes were then further incubated in the presence of 10(-9), 10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6) or 10(-5) mol/L ractopamine. A significant (p less than 0.05) response in cellular protein accretion was observed for the 10(-6) and 10(-5) concentrations when compared to 10(-8) and 10(-9) mol/L ractopamine. Ractopamine at 0 and 10(-6) mol/L was used to examine the effect of the beta agonist on [35S]methionine incorporation (protein synthesis) into total cellular protein, 43-kDa proteins and myosin heavy-chain (200 kDa) protein. Protein synthesis in response to beta agonist treatment was measured at 4, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after ractopamine addition to the ELC5 myotubes in culture. Ractopamine (10(-6) mol/L) increased [35S]methionine incorporation (apparent protein synthesis) at 24 h (p less than 0.01), 48 h (p less than 0.05), 72 h (p less than 0.01) and 96 h (p less than 0.05) in cultured ELC5 muscle cells. Ractopamine also increased apparent protein synthesis rate of the 43-kDa proteins (p less than 0.05) and myosin heavy-chain protein (200 kDa) (p less than 0.05).

Day-old chickens were fed diets containing either 12 or 20% crude protein until 14 d of age and then switched to the opposite diet until 28 d. In experiment 1, chickens were killed at 28 d, and in experiment 2, at intervals following the switch at 14 d. In vitro lipogenesis and lipolysis were determined. The hepatic enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme and fatty acid synthetase were determined during the 14 to 28 d of age growth period. Both in vitro lipogenesis and lipolysis were greater at 28 d when chickens were fed the 12% rather than the 20% protein diet. Neither 0 to 14 d of age dietary treatment influenced 28-d metabolic parameters. In contrast, the 12% protein diet during the first 14-d period depressed body weight (160 g vs. 320 g; p less than 0.05) and weight gain during the 14 to 28 d of age period regardless of dietary crude protein levels (508 g vs. 626 g; p less than 0.05). Lipogenesis and lipolysis were at their highest points 4 d following the dietary switch. Isoproterenol decreased in vitro lipogenesis 70% in all dietary treatment groups. Stimulated lipolysis was not affected by nutritional status and was twice the unstimulated rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cellular copper content and the activity of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase were significantly lower in both resident and thioglycollate-elicited macrophages from -Cu rats than in cells from +Cu controls. Reduced cellular Cu status was associated with impaired respiratory burst as assessed by zymosan-induced chemiluminescent activity and superoxide anion (O2-) generation. Candidacidal activity of macrophages from -Cu rats was also reduced and was highly correlated with chemiluminescent activity and O2- generation. In contrast, phagocytosis of opsonized erythrocytes by peritoneal macrophages from -Cu rats was normal. Elicited peritoneal macrophages from marginally Cu-deficient rats also killed significantly fewer yeast cells than macrophages from +Cu rats. These results demonstrate that macrophage function is impaired by dietary Cu deficiency and that the candidacidal activity of these cells may provide a sensitive indicator of Cu status.\r"

Furthermore, survivability of Candida albicans injected into the peritoneal cavity of Cu-deficient rats was greater than in controls. Phagocytic activity of neutrophils was independent of cellular Cu status. To determine whether the impaired function of neutrophils was also characteristic of marginal Cu deficiency, weaned rats were fed diets containing either 0.6, 1.1, 2.0, 2.7 or 6.7 (control) mg Cu/kg for 5 wk. The activity of Cu,Zn-SOD, phorbol myristate acetate-induced production of O2-, and candidacidal activity were significantly lower in neutrophils from rats fed diets with less than or equal to 2.7 mg Cu/kg compared to control cells. In contrast, decreased tissue Cu and the activity of erythrocyte Cu,Zn-SOD were observed only when dietary Cu was less than or equal to 2.0 mg/kg. Reduced SOD activity, respiratory burst and candidacidal activity of neutrophils were evident as soon as 1 wk after initiating the dietary treatment. Feeding +Cu diet to Cu-deficient rats for 1 wk restored Cu status and function of neutrophils to control levels. These results show that neutrophil function is reversibly impaired by marginal and severe Cu deficiency and suggest that the Cu status and function of these cells may provide a sensitive indicator for assessment of Cu status.\r"

  ".W": "The proliferative response of splenocytes to concanavalin A (Con A) is significantly lower in aged than in young rats. The addition of reduced (GSH) but not oxidized (GSSG) gamma-glutamylcysteinyl-glycine (glutathione) in vitro totally reverses the defective proliferative response of splenocytes from aged rats. The inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, buthionine sulfoximine, abrogates the in vitro proliferation of splenocytes from young rats activated with Con A, and this effect is significantly reversed by addition of GSH. The enhancing effects of GSH on proliferation of Con A-activated splenocytes of both young and old rats are apparent as early as 24 h and are still evident as late as 72 h in culture. Both cysteine and 2-mercaptoethanol are able to mimic the effect of GSH in causing a greater increase in Con A-induced proliferative responses of splenocytes from old rats (eightfold) as compared to young animals (threefold). Although 2-mercaptoethanol increases expression of membrane-bound transferrin receptors on both Con A-activated splenocytes and T lymphocytes, this alone does not account for the greater enhancement of Con A-induced proliferation of splenocytes from old as compared to young rats. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the glutathione peroxidase-dependent detoxification system is defective in T lymphocytes of aged rats.\r"

  ".U": "91087011\r", 
  ".W": "To study the molecular mechanisms by which dietary lipids affect the levels of cytochrome P450 (P450) isozymes, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either fat-free (FF) or 20% corn oil (CO) diet in combination with one of the following three treatments: no inducer, phenobarbital (PB) and acetone. Dietary CO did not affect the constitutive level of P450IIB (PB-inducible), but it affected the induction of P450IIB by PB treatment. The induction of P450IIB by PB in the CO group as determined by 7-pentoxy-resorufin O-dealkylase activity and immunochemically detected protein level was twofold higher than that in the FF group, and this difference was also reflected in the level of mRNA for this enzyme. In contrast, dietary CO increased the constitutive level of P450IIE (ethanol-inducible) twofold as indicated by N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase activity and immunochemically detectable protein, but it had no effect on the induction of P450IIE by acetone. The induced level of P450IIE by acetone in the CO group did not differ from that in the FF group as measured by the enzyme activity and protein level. It was demonstrated that dietary CO affects P450IIB and IIE activities by altering the concentration of the isozymes rather than by modulating their catalytic activities. In addition, dietary CO increased the microsomal testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase activity but not 7 alpha- and 2 alpha-hydroxylase activities, suggesting an increase in P450IIIA and/or IIC13 but not in IIA1 and IIC11, respectively. Dietary CO also affected the constitutive and induced levels of glutathione S-transferase (GST) isozymes in a different manner: it increased the constitutive level of GST-B but not that of GST-A. Nevertheless, it was important for the induction of both GST-A and GST-B by PB treatment. The results suggest that lipid nutrition affects xenobiotic metabolism activities by altering constitutive and inducible levels of certain P450 and GST isozymes.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this research was to determine whether dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids suppress hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA levels by altering FAS gene transcription. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were meal-fed for 10 d a high glucose diet supplemented with 20% digestible energy as menhaden oil or tripalmitin. The transcription rate for FAS was determined by nuclear run-on analysis in hepatic nuclei isolated from rats 2 h postmeal. The values for transcription rates of FAS and S14 (a putative lipogenic protein) in rats fed menhaden oil were only 6 and 21%, respectively, of the rates in rats fed the tripalmitin diet (p less than 0.02). Gene transcription for beta-actin and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase did not differ between treatments. The reduction in hepatic FAS mRNA levels caused by dietary polyunsaturated fats appears to be caused primarily by an inhibition of FAS transcription. The control of transcription by polyunsaturated fats appears not to be mediated by cAMP because the transcription rate for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (whose gene is very sensitive to cAMP stimulation) was unaffected by the source of dietary fat.\r"

  ".U": "91087013\r", 
  ".W": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is characterized by the existence of a unique mitochondrial protein (uncoupling protein or UCP) that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and thus allows heat production. Its role in thermogenesis has been emphasized in recent years in response to cold stress (nonshivering thermogenesis, NST) as well as to hyperphagia (diet-induced thermogenesis, DIT). The present work was a first attempt to determine whether varying nutritional conditions could affect UCP gene expression. Total RNA was isolated from interscapular BAT and hybridized with a cDNA probe for UCP. Changes in UCP mRNA level were studied in rats fasted and refed for various periods at 23 or 28 degrees C. A 2 d fast at 23 degrees C reduced UCP mRNA level, whereas refeeding increased it. A prolonged starvation (53 h) induced an unexpected rise in UCP mRNA, which was associated with a fall in body temperature. Increasing the ambient temperature to thermoneutrality (28 degrees C) suppressed the fall in body temperature as well as the rise in UCP mRNA, which could then be characterized as a cold-induced response. Under the same environmental conditions (28 degrees C), refeeding still triggered a sharp, though transient, increase in UCP mRNA, showing that DIT was dissociated from NST.\r"

Histomorphologically, it is not encapsulated. A spectrum of fibrous connective tissue stroma is present: from myxoid to densely hyalinized and from relatively acellular to cellular. Calcification may or may not be present. It is distinguished by the presence of sparse cords and islands of inactive odontogenic epithelium. Enucleation or surgical curettage is appropriate therapy and recurrence is low.

In all but two patients, blood was found in the superior joint space. Length of time from injury to time of examination correlated with the quantities of blood found. The severity and direction of the blow seemed to influence the findings in the joints. Synovial ecchymosis was a consistent finding. The disc appeared to be grossly intact and within the glenoid fossa in all cases, even when the condyle was grossly displaced. These findings raise questions about the role of direct disc injury as a source of postoperative temporomandibular joint (TMJ) symptoms, as well as about the practice of immobilization of fractures immediately after trauma. Further studies will be necessary to compare the treatment results in patients who have had arthroscopy versus those who have not.\r"

After 90 days, the nerve repairs were removed and the two sides compared by clinical appearance, and histologic and electrophysiologic assessment. The conduits instilled with control solution failed to result in nerve regeneration in any of the animals. The conduits with NGF solution, however, consistently displayed neural connections between the proximal and distal ends with the presence of slowed, but recordable, conduction velocities. The axonal numbers in the NGF repairs were significantly less than those of the normal nerve, but when adjusted for fascicular size, the axonal densities were comparable. In addition, osteoid tissue was observed around many of the NGF-induced nerve regenerates, but not on the control solution side, suggesting a possible influence of this protein on bone formation.\r"

A total of 30 joints (18 patients) were studied. Twenty-seven of these 30 joints were treated with the appliance until the joints were silent to auscultation. The patients were then evaluated with axial corrected tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the centric occlusion position and with their bite appliance (Sved-type) in place. Comparisons were made between condyle position in centric occlusion and with the appliance in place. Magnetic resonance imaging was then used to evaluate disc positional changes. Each imaging procedure was made in the same sagittal plane. Only changes in condyle positioning could be identified. Evidence of disc repositioning with the appliance in place was seen in only three MRI examinations. The remaining 27 joints continued to exhibit disc displacement with various changes in disc morphology. It is concluded that the concept of \"disc capture\" is a clinical term only, and that such perceived clinical success should not lead to the assumption that an actual change in intra-articular anatomic relationships has occurred. Joint noises may decrease because joint space is increased, allowing smoother condylar translation beyond disc surface irregularities and positional abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the interaction between the polyamines spermine and spermidine and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by using (+)-[3H]-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-im ine maleate ([3H]MK801) binding to well washed rat brain membranes. The actions of arcaine, agmatine, diethylenetriamine and 1,8-octanediamine as polyamine antagonists were compared to use as tools in this study. Arcaine was found to be the antagonist of choice due to its greater potency. Several divalent cations, including Ba++, Ca++ and Sr++, but not Zn++, decreased the apparent potency of arcaine. These cations enhance [3H]MK801 binding in a similar fashion to spermidine and spermine suggesting that they may share a common site and mechanism of action. Moreover, arcaine competitively reduced the enhancement of [3H]MK801 binding produced by Sr++ did not alter the inhibition produced by higher concentrations of this cation, a phenomenon that also occurs with spermidine. The distinct arcaine sensitivity of the two separate phases of the concentration-response curves of both spermidine and Sr++ suggests two separate mechanisms underlying the action of spermidine-like drugs on the NMDA receptor. Further investigation of the increase in [3H]MK801 binding produced by spermidine revealed that spermidine increased the equilibrium affinity of this ligand by 2-fold without significantly altering the density of binding sites. In contrast, polyamine induced increases in the dissociation of [3H]MK801 required higher polyamine concentrations than necessary to increase ligand binding and were relatively insensitive to arcaine. These findings suggest that polyamines do not activate or promote the activation of the NMDA receptor, but instead enhance [3H]MK801 binding by allosterically increasing ligand affinity.\r"

  ".W": "Xanthines are effective in the treatment of asthma, but the mechanism of action remains unclear. Pulmonary effects of seven xanthines, exhibiting a range of potencies as cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and as adenosine antagonists, were investigated in anesthetized and ventilated guinea pigs. The bronchodilator effects of xanthines, determined from reversal of bronchoconstriction induced by aerosols of histamine and carbachol, correlated with their relative potencies as cyclic AMP-PDE inhibitors. The hypotensive effects of xanthines at bronchodilator doses were also consistent with PDE inhibition. Prophylactic effects of xanthines against bronchoconstriction induced by an aerosol of ovalbumin in sensitized guinea pigs, or by aerosols of leukotriene D4 and platelet-activating factor (PAF) in normal guinea pigs, occurred by a mechanism unrelated to bronchodilation and could not be readily attributed to PDE inhibition or adenosine A1/A2 receptor antagonism. There was a close association between inhibition of the responses to antigen and leukotriene D4, suggesting a common mechanism of action, but these effects gave a different profile from inhibition of the response to PAF. In addition, PAF-induced hypotension was unaffected in animals in which PAF-induced bronchoconstriction was inhibited, suggesting a mechanism other than PAF receptor antagonism. These results indicate that the bronchodilator, antiallergic and anti-inflammatory effects of xanthines occur through multiple molecular mechanisms of action, including at least one unknown mechanism. Furthermore, 8-phenyltheophylline produces these prophylactic effects at a dose that does not produce the cardiovascular or emetic side effects associated with xanthines, thereby exhibiting unique characteristics of potential therapeutic importance.\r"

In normal rats AVP inhibition with a 35-micrograms/kg bolus of AVP V1 antagonist did not change heart rate, right atrial, left ventricular systolic, left ventricular end-diastolic or aortic pressures. There were also no changes in mean circulatory filling pressure, unstressed vascular volume, blood volume or venous compliance. In rats with infarction and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, AVP inhibition did not change heart rate, right atrial pressure, mean circulatory filling pressure or blood volume, but mean aortic pressure decreased from 103 +/- 3 to 88 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than .001), venous compliance increased (P less than .001) from 2.17 +/- 0.07 to 3.04 +/- 0.11 ml/mm Hg/kg and unstressed vascular volume decreased from 42.3 +/- 3.1 to 34.7 +/- 2.6 ml/kg (P less than .05). We conclude that inhibition of AVP with a specific V1 antagonist had no effect on the venous or arterial circulations in normal rats, but in rats with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure after chronic myocardial infarction, AVP inhibition decreased arterial pressure and caused venodilatation.\r"

  ".U": "91087133\r", 
  ".W": "Octimibate inhibited ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation in human, rabbit and rat platelet-rich plasma. Washed human platelets treated with octimibate had elevated cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. When whole platelets were incubated with radiolabeled phosphate, octimibate produced an increase in the phosphorylation of platelet proteins with relative molecular weights of 22, 26, 50 and 80 kilodaltons. This pattern of protein phosphorylation is identical to that observed when the platelets were treated with forskolin, phosphodiesterase inhibitors or other compounds that elevate platelet cAMP levels. Octimibate also inhibited the rise in intracellular Ca++ caused by thrombin, as measured using Fura-2-loaded platelets, which is consistent with octimibate's ability to elevate platelet cAMP levels. When isolated platelet plasma membranes were treated with octimibate, adenylate cyclase activity was stimulated, reaching maximal activation at 1 microM octimibate. (The maximal activation of adenylate cyclase observed with octimibate is 70-75% of that observed with 10 microM PGE1.) This stimulation of platelet adenylate cyclase activity was enhanced by GTP. Octimibate competed for radiolabeled prostaglandin E1 and lloprost binding to isolated platelet membranes at submicromolar concentrations, but did not compete with radiolabeled prostaglandin D2 binding. These studies suggest that octimibate inhibits platelet aggregation by activating platelet adenylate cyclase through stimulation of platelet prostacyclin receptors.\r"

  ".U": "91087134\r", 
  ".W": "Morphine is the prototypic mu-opioid analgesic; however, in certain situations in vitro, morphine behaves as a partial agonist. To assess the relative intrinsic activity of morphine and three other mu-opioid analgesics in vivo, beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), an irreversible antagonist selective for the mu receptor, was used to reduce the effective receptor reserve. By using a stereotaxic device, 1.25 to 20 micrograms of beta-FNA was infused into the lateral ventricle of rats. Twenty-four hours later, animals were tested in the tail-flick assay with cumulative doses of morphine, levorphanol, methadone or fentanyl. Pretreatment with 2.5 micrograms of beta-FNA induced parallel rightward shifts of both the morphine and levorphanol dose-effect curves and 5.0 micrograms of beta-FNA reduced the maximum analgesic effect of these agonists. Methadone surmounted the antagonism of 5.0 micrograms of beta-FNA; 10 micrograms was required to reduce the maximum analgesic effect of methadone. Fentanyl overcame the blockade induced by both 5.0 and 10 micrograms of beta-FNA. Only with a pretreatment dose of 20 micrograms of beta-FNA was the maximum analgesic effect of fentanyl reduced. Thus, when a certain proportion of mu receptors is inactivated, i.e., with 5.0 micrograms of beta-FNA, fentanyl and methadone have the capacity to surmount the blockade, whereas morphine and levorphanol do not. This suggests that fentanyl and methadone have higher intrinsic efficacies than do morphine and levorphanol. Thus, a strategy used widely in vitro was applied successfully in vivo to assess relative intrinsic activities of a series of mu-opioid agonists.\r"

The initial uptake of tetraethylammonium in the presence or absence of an outward H+ gradient was inhibited by ofloxacin in a dose-dependent manner, although the equilibrium value of tetraethylammonium uptake was not affected. This inhibition occurred in a competitive manner (Ki = 0.11 mM). Ofloxacin also inhibited the initial uptake of cephalexin and cephradine, which can be transported via the H+/organic cation antiport system in renal brush-border membranes. In contrast, ofloxacin had no effect on p-aminohippurate. These data suggest that ofloxacin interacts with the organic cation transport system in renal brush-border membranes, and this system may play an important role in the tubular secretion of ofloxacin.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of bupivacaine on K+ currents in isolated rat ventricular myocytes were examined using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Bupivacaine at concentrations greater than 3 microM produced both a reduction in the peak current amplitude and a marked increase in the rate of inactivation of the transient outward current (Ito). Examination of its time course showed that there was no inhibition before the beginning of a depolarizing pulse. However, upon continuous depolarization (i.e., during channel opening) inhibition of Ito developed in an exponential manner, the rate and magnitude of which were dependent on bupivacaine concentration. The IC50 for inhibition of Ito was 22 microM. Bupivacaine had no effect on the voltage-dependence of steady-state inactivation or the rate of recovery from inactivation. The (+)- and (-)-stereoisomers of bupivacaine were equipotent indicating that there is no stereoselectivity to the inhibition of Ito. Increasing the hydrophobicity of the tertiary amine on bupivacaine greatly enhanced its potency. Thus, octylacaine (1-octyl-2',6'-pipecoloxylidide) (C8-N) was 6 times more potent than bupivacaine (C4-N) and 200 times more potent than mepivacaine (C1-N). In contrast to their effects on Ito, bupivacaine (1 mM) and octylacaine (100 microM) failed to produce any block of the inward rectifier K+ current. However, mepivacaine (3 mM) reduced inward rectifier K+ current reversibly by approximately 50%. These results suggest that inhibition of Ito may contribute to bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "In the pineal gland and retina of chickens, serotonin N-acetyl-transferase (NAT) activity and melatonin content are modulated by different receptors, alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in pineal gland and D2-dopamine receptors in retina. The effect of two D2-dopamine receptor agonists, bromocriptine and quinpirole (LY 171555), on melatonin synthesis in these tissues was investigated. Systemic administrations of bromocriptine and quinpirole decreased nocturnal NAT activity and melatonin content of both pineal gland and retina. Bromocriptine was equipotent in the two tissues, whereas quinpirole was approximately 100-fold more potent in retina than in pineal gland. In pineal gland, the suppressive effects of bromocriptine and quinpirole on NAT activity were blocked by yohimbine, a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist, but not by spiperone, a D2-dopamine receptor antagonist. In contrast, bromocriptine- and quinpirole-induced decreases of the enzyme activity in retina were antagonized by spiperone, and not affected by yohimbine. The nocturnal increase of NAT activity of pineal glands in vitro was inhibited with an order of potency clonidine greater than bromocriptine greater than quinpirole. Additionally, bromocriptine and quinpirole displaced the specific binding of [3H]rauwolscine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist, to membranes from chicken pineal gland, with potencies comparable to those observed for inhibition of NAT activity in vitro. It is suggested that bromocriptine and quinpirole, in addition to their D2-dopaminergic activity, can stimulate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in pineal gland of chicken.\r"

This treatment increased renal NE content and increased the absolute stimulus-induced overflow of NE. The increase in absolute overflow was not simply the result of the increase in renal NE content as fractional overflow was also increased slightly (20%). Alpha adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine eliminated the NE treatment-induced difference in fractional overflow. However, the dose-response curves to phentolamine and the alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist UK 14,304 on stimulus-induced overflow from the kidney were not significantly different after NE treatment. Chronic EPI treatment (same dose) produced an 80% increase in fractional stimulus-induced overflow of neurotransmitter but the dose-response curve to UK 14,304 was shifted only slight to the right (3-fold) of the control curve. No influence of prejunctional beta adrenoceptors on stimulus-induced overflow was observed in either the control of the NE-treated group. In conclusion, the data regarding fractional overflow and the effects of the phentolamine suggest that NE treatment produces minimal change whereas EPI treatment produces marked decreases in the influence in prejunctional alpha adrenoceptors. However, although the data with UK 14,304 after NE treatment support this conclusion, the failure of EPI treatment to alter the dose-response curve to UK 14,304 does not. The apparent contradiction of the results with the alpha adrenoceptor agonist in the EPI-treated group as well as the large differences between the effects of NE vs. EPI treatment on stimulus-induced overflow and prejunctional alpha adrenoceptor function cannot be explained at this time.\r"

Arcaine did not alter kainate- or potassium-induced [3H]NE release suggesting a specific effect on NMDA-mediated responses. Spermidine did not alter NMDA-induced [3H]NE release, nor did it reverse the effect of arcaine when introduced in a normal physiologic superfusion buffer. However, spermidine reversed the effect of arcaine when superfusing with buffer that contained 5% (v/v) of the organic solvent dimethylsulfoxide. This finding suggests that the polyamine site may be located at the intracellular surface of the cell membrane.

  ".W": "The role of the central noradrenergic systems and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in modulating defensive withdrawal behavior was studied in rats. The apparatus consisted of a small chamber set on one side of a one-meter open field, into which the rat was placed to start the test. When rats were unfamiliar with the apparatus, they displayed species typical defensive withdrawal behavior with long latencies to emerge from and a high proportion of time spent in the small chamber. Intraperitoneal administration of clonidine (0.03 mg/kg), l-propranolol (2.5 micrograms/kg), prazosin (0.1 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5 mg/kg) each significantly decreased the latency to emerge from and the mean time spent in the small chamber (MTIC) and increased the number of chamber entries. When rats were familiar with the apparatus, prior restraint for 20 min significantly increased the latency and MTIC, and decreased the number of chamber entries and rears, but did not alter locomotor activity. Prazosin, clonidine, CDP, l-propranolol and the CRF-antagonist, alpha-helical CRF9-41 (25 micrograms i.c.v.), reversed the restraint-induced increase in the latency and MTIC. CRF (10-100 ng i.c.v.) dose-dependently induced defensive withdrawal behavior in rats familiar with the apparatus; the minimum statistically significant dose was 50 ng. dl-Propranolol (5 mg/kg) and CDP blocked the CRF-induced changes in the latency to emerge and the MTIC; whereas clonidine and prazosin significantly reduced the latency, but had no statistically significant effects on the MTIC. Phenylephrine (25-200 ng i.c.v.) dose-dependently induced defensive withdrawal behavior. This effect of phenylephrine (200 ng) was significantly antagonized by prazosin or alpha-helical CRF9-41 (25 or 50 mg i.c.v.), but not by CDP. Our results suggest that the hyperactivity of the central noradrenergic systems caused by exposure to the novel environment may stimulate the release of CRF, which through some unknown mechanism induces defensive withdrawal behavior in rats. Activation of beta adrenergic receptors may also induce defensive withdrawal.\r"

Working memory was assessed by behavior maintained under a spatial alternation schedule of food presentation in which the interval between trials was varied from 2 to 32 sec. Under control conditions the percentage of correct responses decreased as the retention interval was varied from 2 to 32 sec. Administered alone the cholinergic agonists oxotremorine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg), arecoline (3-30 mg/kg), RS86 (0.3-3 mg/kg) and pilocarpine (0.3-3.0 mg/kg), and the cholinesterase inhibitors physostigmine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) and tetrahydroaminoacridine (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) either had no effect on or produced dose-related deficits in working memory and decreases in response rates. The muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (0.1 mg/kg) produced retention interval-dependent decreases in the percentage of correct responding and rates of responding. The cholinergic agonists and tetrahydroaminoacridine failed to reverse the effects of scopolamine. However, physostigmine produced a dose-dependent reversal of the working-memory deficits and response-rate decreasing effects of scopolamine. The present results are consistent with the interpretation that drugs which primarily enhance M2 muscarinic cholinergic transmission are ineffective in enhancing working memory or in reversing scopolamine-induced deficits in working memory.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a new histamine H2-receptor antagonist, IT-066 (3-amino-4-[4-[4-(1-piperidinomethyl)-2-pyridyloxy]-cis-2-++ +butenylamino]- 3-cyclobutene-1,2-dione hydrochloride), were investigated on the secretagogue-induced acid secretion in vivo and in vitro, and on experimental gastric and duodenal lesion in rats. IT-066 (10-60 micrograms/kg) given i.v. inhibited histamine-stimulated acid secretion dose-dependently in gastric lumen-perfused rats, and the inhibitory effect was observed for about 12 hr. Famotidine (FMD) (10-60 micrograms/kg i.v.) also had an antisecretory effect, but the acid secretion recovered to the control level 4 hr after the administration. Cold stress plus indomethacin-induced lesion was significantly inhibited by IT-066 and FMD given i.v. 30 min before the cold stress plus indomethacin treatment. IT-066 given 7 hr before the cold stress plus indomethacin treatment also inhibited lesion formation significantly, but such antilesional effect was not observed with FMD. In the rat isolated gastric mucosal sheet, IT-066 inhibited histamine-stimulated acid secretion dose-dependently and noncompetitively; its action was produced via a unique mechanism. The inhibitory effect of IT-066 remained after washing of the mucosa, and became more potent time-dependently. The inhibitory effects of FMD and cimetidine were not observed after washing the mucosa. These data suggest that IT-066 has a potent and long lasting antisecretory effect in vivo and in vitro, and that these properties are responsible for the long lasting antilesional action.\r"

Methionine enkephalin (10(-12)-10(-6) M) increased pial arteriolar diameter (139 +/- 4, 149 +/- 3, 178 +/- 3 microns, for control, 10(-12), and 10(-6) M, respectively). Leucine enkephalin produced similar pial arteriolar dilation. In contrast, dynorphin elicited dilation during normotension and constriction during hypotension. beta-Endorphin (10(-12)-10(-6) M) decreased pial arteriolar diameter (137 +/- 6, 128 +/- 6, 92 +/- 7 microns, for control, 10(-12) and 10(-6) M, respectively). All four opioids increased cerebrospinal fluid 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG)F1 alpha, PGE2, PGF2 alpha and thromboxane B2. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.) blocked methionine and leucine enkephalin and dynorphin-induced pial arteriolar dilation, but potentiated beta-endorphin-induced constriction and the constriction caused by dynorphin in hypotensive piglets. These data indicate that prostanoids modulate opioid effects on the cerebral vasculature.\r"

  ".U": "91087144\r", 
  ".W": "The extracellular concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DOPEG), one of the major metabolites of brain NA, in the hypothalamus of urethane-anesthetized rats were monitored by in vivo microdialysis followed by a sensitive and simultaneous determination of the two substances using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The effects of various drugs that affect central NA metabolism were also examined. Resting levels of NA and DOPEG were constant during 1 and 6 hr after the start of perfusion, the mean values being 3.8 +/- 0.4 pg/30 min for NA and 107.5 +/- 9.1 pg/30 min for DOPEG (mean +/- S.E.M. of 7 animals). Tetrodotoxin (1 microM), when added to the perfusion medium, reduced the output of NA below the detection limit (0.5 pg) and also decreased the DOPEG output by 60%. Clonidine (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) caused a marked reduction in both the NA and DOPEG outputs, whereas yohimbine (5 mg/kg i.p.) significantly increased both the NA and DOPEG outputs. Desipramine (2 and 5 mg/kg i.p.) produced a dose-dependent increase in the NA output, although it caused a gradual decline of the DOPEG output. The atypical antidepressant mianserin (2 and 5 mg/kg i.p.), which possesses both alpha-2 antagonist and weak NA uptake inhibitory actions, produced a less marked increase in the NA output with no or only a small decrease in the DOPEG output. Therefore, it is suggested that monitoring the extracellular concentrations of both NA and DOPEG enables the discrimination between the action of drugs inhibiting the NA uptake and that of drugs enhancing the NA release, and that this method is useful to obtain detailed information about central NA metabolism in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The stimulus properties of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-like compounds were studied in rats trained to discriminate saline from (+)-N-methyl-1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-butanamine [(+)-MBDB] hydrochloride (7.18 mumol/kg; 1.75 mg/kg), the alpha-ethyl homolog of MDMA. In previous experiments with (+)-MBDB as a test drug, complete substitution was observed for MDMA but not for (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide or (+)-amphetamine. In the study reported here, the (+)-MBDB cue generalized to MDMA and the parent drug, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine. All three drugs exhibited a similar stereoselectivity, the (+)-isomer having potency greater than the (-)-isomer. By contrast, the hallucinogens, (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine and mescaline and the psychostimulants (+)-amphetamine and (+)-methamphetamine did not substitute for (+)-MBDB. Cocaine produced partial substitution. The results support the hypothesis that the primary behavioral activity of MDMA-like compounds is unlike that of hallucinogens and stimulants and may represent the effects of a novel drug class, given the name entactogens. Although the mechanism of action for the discriminative stimulus properties of MDMA-like compounds is not known, there is evidence that presynaptic serotonergic, but not dopaminergic, mechanisms are critical. Finally, 5,6-methylenedioxy-2-aminoindan a non-neurotoxic 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine rigid analog that was previously found to substitute for MDMA but not for (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide was found in the study described here to substitute completely for (+)-MBDB. The N-methyl derivative 5,6-methylenedioxy-2-methylminoindan produced similar results. The demonstration of entactogen-like discriminative stimulus properties, for drugs devoid of neuronal degenerative toxicity potential, serves as evidence of the independent mechanisms for these effects in rats.\r"

  ".W": "The antinociceptive interaction of opiate analgesics with clonidine was examined with the tail-flick and 55 degrees C hot plate tests. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received fixed ratios of clonidine to fentanyl, meperidine or morphine by i.v. and intrathecal injection. Data are expressed as percentage of maximal possible effect and the dose producing 50 percentage of maximal possible effect for each drug or drug combination is used to index potency. The rank order of potency in both tests after i.v. administration is fentanyl much greater than clonidine greater than meperidine greater than or equal to morphine and after intrathecal administration it is morphine greater than fentanyl much greater than clonidine much greater than meperidine. Isobolographic analysis shows that the effect of clonidine combined with an opiate is additive after i.v. administration; the exception is that morphine and clonidine are synergistic in the hot plate test. The intrathecal combinations of clonidine with morphine or meperidine produces a supra-additive antinociceptive effect in the tail-flick test but not in the hot plate test. Fentanyl does so in both tests. These data confirm a positive interaction between clonidine and opiates in producing antinociception. This interaction may be additive or synergistic, depending on route of administration and the nociceptive test used. The timing of injections and pharmacokinetic factors may also influence the results. Moreover, these results suggest that the interaction between the opiate and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors occurs within the spinal cord.\r"

  ".U": "91087147\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of various Ca++ antagonists and local anesthetics on neuronal cell degeneration induced by veratridine was studied in primary rat brain neuronal cultures. Cell death was quantified by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released in the culture medium. The neuronal cell degeneration was Ca+(+)-dependent because, in the absence of extracellular Ca++, 16 hr of exposure to 30 microM veratridine failed to produce release of LDH. Ca++ antagonists, nonselective for slow Ca++ channels (flunarizine, cinnarizine, lidoflazine, prenylamine and bepridil) inhibited veratridine-induced release of LDH with IC50 values between 0.11 and 0.47 microM. Ca++ antagonists selective for slow Ca++ channels were less potent and inhibited veratridine-induced release of LDH at concentrations in the following order of potency: nicardipine greater than gallopamil and verapamil greater than niludipine greater than nitrendipine greater than nifedipine greater than nimodipine greater than diltiazem. Tested local anesthetics were incomplete inhibitors of veratridine-induced release of LDH. A good correlation was found between the potency of the drugs to inhibit released LDH induced by 30 microM veratridine in neuronal cultures and their binding affinity for the batrachotoxin binding site of Na+ channels in rat cortex synaptosomal preparation. It is concluded that protection against veratridine-induced neurotoxicity can be mediated by blocking a veratridine-sensitive Na+ channel. It is a property of certain nonselective Ca++ antagonists. There is apparently no direct relationship with Ca++ antagonistic activity. The effect is unrelated to local anesthetic activity.\r"

Substitution of placebo capsules for caffeine capsules occurred under double-blind conditions while subjects rated various dimensions of their mood and behavior. In the first phase of the study, substitution of placebo for 12 consecutive days resulted in an orderly withdrawal syndrome in 4 subjects which peaked on days 1 or 2 and progressively decreased toward prewithdrawal levels over about 1 week. Data from the remaining three subjects provided no evidence of withdrawal. In the second phase of the study, the generality of the withdrawal effect was examined by repeatedly substituting placebo for 100 mg/day of caffeine for 1-day periods separated by an average of 9 days. Despite differences within and across subjects with respect to the presence, nature and magnitude of symptoms, each of the seven subjects demonstrated a statistically significant withdrawal effect. Although the phenomenon of caffeine withdrawal has been described previously, the present report documents that the incidence of caffeine withdrawal is higher (100% of subjects), the daily dose level at which withdrawal occurs is lower (roughly equivalent to the amount of caffeine in a single cup of strong brewed coffee or 3 cans of caffeinated soft drink) and the range of symptoms experienced is broader (including headache, fatigue and other dysphoric mood changes, muscle pain/stiffness, flu-like feelings, nausea/vomiting and craving for caffeine) than heretofore recognized.\r"

According to a random Latin square design, healthy young male volunteers were given i.m. injections containing single doses of placebo or 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 mg of atropine. The central nervous system tests included wheel tracking, a coordination task, and digit symbol substitution, a memory-psychomotor speed task; the physiological variable was heart rate. The pharmacokinetics of atropine were best described by a two-compartment model with very rapid first order absorption. Changes in plasma atropine levels and heart rate closely overlapped for all four doses throughout most of the time course. In contrast, the differential time course of changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effects of atropine. Alternative explanations are discussed, including differential atropine effects on peripheral M2 receptors mediating a heart rate effect and on CNS M1 receptors mediating the memory-psychomotor effect.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of subtypes of the muscarinic receptor in homogenates of the rat brain was investigated by measuring the competitive inhibition of the binding [3H]N-methylscopolamine by pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 (11[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one). In most brain regions, the competitive binding curves for AF-DX 116 and pirenzepine were consistent with a two-site model. The dissociation constant of pirenzepine for its high-affinity site (M1 receptor) was approximately 10(-8) M, whereas the dissociation constant of AF-DX 116 for its high affinity site (M2 receptor) was approximately 10(-7) M. In many regions, particularly those in the forebrain, the sum of the densities of the M1 and M2 binding sites was substantially less than 100% of the total sites, indicating the existence of a third population of sites lacking high affinity for both pirenzepine and AF-DX 116. We have designated these latter sites as non-M1, non-M2 muscarinic receptors. In general, the densities of the M1 and non-M1, non-M2 binding sites were highest in cerebral cortex, corpus striatum and hippocampus, intermediate in thalamus and hypothalamus, and lowest in midbrain, medulla-pons and cerebellum, whereas the M2 binding site had a relatively low, uniform density throughout the brain. The binding capacity of [3H]N-methylquinuclidinyl benzilate was estimated to be 20 to 30% lower than that of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in various regions of the forebrain, but not in more caudal regions of the brain where the two radioligands had approximately the same binding capacities. Treatment of homogenates of the cerebral cortex with benzilylcholine mustard caused a selective loss of the majority of the [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding sites but spared 25% of the sites labeled by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate The results of pirenzepine/[3H]quinuclinyl benzilate competitive binding experiments on cerebral cortex treated with benzilylcholine mustard showed that the residual binding sites for [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate were enriched in M1 muscarinic receptors.\r"

Pain thresholds were determined using the tail withdrawal procedure, in which monkeys restrained in chairs kept their tails in cool (35 degrees C) water for at least 20 sec, but withdrew them from warm (55 degrees C) water in less than 4 sec. Morphine produced a dose-related increase in tail withdrawal latencies from warm water. Devazepide (injected i.p. or p.o.) had no effect on tail withdrawal latencies when given alone but enhanced the analgesic effects of morphine. The devazepide dose-response curve for morphine enhancement was bell-shaped with doses of 3, 10, 30 and 100 micrograms/kg injected i.p. increasing morphine analgesia whereas higher and lower dose did not. In a separate group of monkeys, morphine produced dose-dependent decreases in respiratory rate and oxygen tension and increases in carbon dioxide tension. In contrast to its effects on morphine analgesia, devazepide had no effect on the various indices of morphine-induced respiratory depression. These data suggest that devazepide may have therapeutic utility as an adjuvant to morphine analgesia allowing lower dose of the opiate to be used to relieve pain and reducing the risk of opiate-induced respiratory depression.\r"

At high concentrations, lincomycin and clindamycin reduced epc amplitude, but analysis of driving functions showed that only with clindamycin was this due solely to changes in epc quantal content. The effect of lincomycin on epc amplitude was exaggerated by rapid channel block during the rising phase of the epc. Clindamycin produced currents with a single exponential decay and single Lorentzian noise spectra. All the other compounds produced currents which decayed as the sum of two exponential components. For lincomycin and epilincomycin, noise spectra consisted of two Lorentzian components. For epiclindamycin and deoxylincomycin, although epcs and miniature end-plate currents decayed with two components, it was not possible to separate two components in the noise spectra. A kinetic analysis of ion channel blocking actions showed only small differences between the two pairs of stereoisomers studied. End-plate ion channel blocking and unblocking rate constants did not vary greatly among the compounds but the end-plate ion channel unblocking rate constant values for the two lincomycin stereoisomers were larger than those for the two clindamycin stereoisomers. Deoxylincomycin exhibited properties similar to those of the clindamycins. It was concluded that lipid solubility, not stereochemical conformation, plays the greater role in determining the ion channel blocking properties within the series, particularly that of the rate of dissociation of the compound from end-plate ion channels.\r"

  ".W": "The organic cation cimetidine undergoes renal tubular secretion in the near-term ovine fetus. We investigated the ontogeny of renal tubular secretion of organic cations in the fetus from 80 days of gestation (term = 145). Sixteen sheep were administered both cimetidine and ranitidine in random order by a combination of bolus and i.v. infusion to achieve steady-state plasma concentrations of 1000 to 2000 ng/ml. A further two sheep received cimetidine only. Steady-state plasma concentrations were reached within 2 to 3 hr. Creatinine was used as a marker of glomerular filtration rate. Maternal renal clearance of cimetidine (0.51 +/- 0.18 l/min) and ranitidine (0.54 +/- 0.14 l/min) were not correlated with the period of gestation. Cimetidine/creatinine and ranitidine/creatinine renal clearance ratios were higher than unity being 5.48 +/- 1.91 and 5.65 +/- 1.18, respectively. Fetal creatinine renal clearance increased exponentially with gestational age (r2 = 0.577, P less than .001). Fetal renal clearance of both cimetidine and ranitidine also increased exponentially with gestational age, this trend being more clear-cut for cimetidine (r2 = 0.582, P less than .001) than for ranitidine (r2 = 0.254, P = .046). The rates of increase for cimetidine and ranitidine were similar to that for creatinine (P greater than .05). At 80 days, cimetidine/creatinine and ranitidine/creatinine renal clearance ratios (3.0 and 4.4, respectively) were higher than unity and did not increase further during the remainder of gestation. Therefore, the ovine fetus possesses an efficient tubular secretory pathway for organic cations by 80 days of gestation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The trichothecene mycotoxin T-2 is a potent inhibitor of intracellular protein synthesis. We have previously shown that a mouse immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody (15H6) specific for T-2 toxin can neutralize the in vitro protein synthesis inhibitory effect of the toxin in human B-lymphoblastoid cultures, and protect rats from lethal toxemia. We now report that these monoclonal antibodies can induce the net efflux of [3H]-T-2 toxin from poisoned human B-lymphoblastoid cells in vitro, and restore protein synthesis. Administration of the monoclonal antibodies (250 mg/kg) 30 min before infusion of a lethal dose (1 mg/kg) of T-2 toxin causes the sequestration of the toxin in the plasma compartment. When administered 35 min after T-2 toxin, a time when the bulk of toxin is in the tissues, the monoclonal antibodies facilitate the migration of toxin back into the plasma compartment. These data demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies can be of therapeutic value against an intracellular toxin.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acute and chronic treatment with ethanol were studied on the number and activity of tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na-channels in cultured rat skeletal muscle. The number of channels was determined by measurements of specific binding of [3H] saxitoxin (STX) in whole cell preparations. Measurements were also made of the frequency and rate of rise of spontaneously occurring action potentials, which are the physiologic expression of Na-channel density. Acute ethanol (37.5-150 mM), while causing depolarization of membrane potential and blockade of electrical activity, was without effect on specific STX binding. Neither methanol, acetaldehyde nor ethylene glycol had significant effects on these properties when given acutely in the same concentrations as ethanol. Chronic ethanol caused dose-related increases in STX binding and action potential properties with maximal levels being attained after 3 days of treatment at a concentration of 150 mM. On removal of ethanol from the culture medium all properties returned to control levels after 48 hr. Both increased external K+ and tetrodotoxin, which up-regulate Na-channels by reducing cytosolic Ca++, potentiated the ethanol-induced increase in Na-channel density. The increase in STX binding was not associated with changes in affinity of the binding sites for the ligand but was completely prevented by treatment with cycloheximide and actinomycin D. The results demonstrate that ethanol interacts with the cell membrane to induce synthesis of STX-binding sites.\r"

Adenosine agonists and antagonists dose dependently accentuated and attenuated, respectively, ethanol-induced motor incoordination, thereby suggesting a central mechanism of adenosine modulation of this effect of ethanol and confirmed our previous reports in which adenosine agonists and antagonists were given i.p. Enprofylline, a weak adenosine antagonist but potent inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, did not alter ethanol's motor incoordination, further supporting involvement of brain adenosine receptor mechanism(s) in ethanol-adenosine interactions. Results from R-PIA and N6-(S-phenylisopropyl)adenosine experiments showed nearly a 40-fold greater potency of R-vs. S-diastereoisomer, suggesting predominance of adenosine A1 subtype. However, 5'-(N-cyclopropyl)-carboxamidoadenosine data indicate complexity of the mechanism(s) and point toward an additional involvement of a yet unknown subtype of adenosine A2. No effect of ethanol on blood or brain levels of [3H]R-PIA was noted and sufficient amount of the latter entered the brain to suggest adenosine receptor activation adequate to produce behavioral interaction with ethanol. There was no escape of i.c.v.-administered [3H]R-PIA from brain to the peripheral circulation ruling out a peripheral and supporting a central mechanism of ethanol-adenosine interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cellular inhibitory activity of UCN-01 against protein kinase C and cytotoxicity of UCN-01 were compared with those of staurosporine. When the mechanism of inhibitory activity was investigated in vitro, UCN-01 as well as staurosporine inhibited the activity of the catalytic domain of protein kinase C. In spite of direct inhibition against the catalytic domain of protein kinase C, cytotoxicity of UCN-01 was much lower than that of staurosporine. In addition, UCN-01 showed more selective inhibitory activity against protein kinase C than did staurosporine because of the sole structural difference at C-7. Therefore, a series of 7-O-alkyl derivatives of UCN-01 was synthesized and investigated. Interestingly, one of the compounds, the beta-methoxy derivative, showed 3-fold greater potency and 17-fold more selective inhibitory activity against protein kinase C than did UCN-01.\r"

At sufficiently high doses, each of these neuroleptics increased error rates (interfered with learning) and reduced rate of responding. When the drugs were compared on the basis of absolute doses administered, haloperidol disrupted behavior at doses considerably lower than the other drugs. If, however, chlorpromazine equivalent doses were examined, haloperidol was the least disruptive of the four drugs. Comparing the degree of behavioral disruption produced by the four drugs with their relative neuroreceptor affinities for dopamine D-2, cholinergic muscarinic, histamine H1, alpha-1 adrenergic and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors suggests that behavioral disruption cannot be attributed in any simple way to dopamine or acetylcholine receptor blockade. The relationship between the behavioral effects of neuroleptics and their simple neuropharmacological actions must be considered as highly tentative.\r"

  ".U": "91087165\r", 
  ".W": "Zolpidem, which is currently marketed in Europe as a hypnotic, is a short-duration imidazopyridine whose actions are mediated at the gamma-aminobutyric acid benzodiazepine receptor complex. However, zolpidem produces a variety of biochemical differences from classic benzodiazepine agonists including showing selectivity for the central BZ1 (omega 1) receptor subtype as well as showing a different pattern of distribution of binding sites. This study compared zolpidem to the benzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam in 15 healthy male volunteers with histories of sedative drug abuse. Placebo, zolpidem (15, 30 and 45 mg) and triazolam (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mg) were administered p.o. in a mixed sequence in a double-blind, cross-over design. The onset time with zolpidem was faster than with triazolam, with peak effects of both drugs occurring at 1 to 2 hr after administration. Both zolpidem and triazolam produced dose-related decrements in performance on various performance tasks including circular lights, reaction time, balance, number recall and the digit symbol substitution test. Both drugs also produced similar dose-related changes on various observer ratings including overall strength of drug effect. Triazolam, but not zolpidem, increased subject- and observer-rated sleepiness and produced greater impairment on a picture memory task. Zolpidem, but not triazolam, produced increases in subject ratings of various somatic symptoms (e.g., dizzy, anxious and queasy) and there were 9 days on which subjects vomited after zolpidem, but none after triazolam. Although the highest dose of both drugs was identified by subjects as being active, the highest dose of triazolam was identified as being barbiturate, benzodiazepine or alcohol, almost twice as often as the highest dose of zolpidem. Overall, this study shows that although zolpidem produces many effects in common with triazolam, it also has a unique profile of effects distinguishable from classic benzodiazepine agonists. The mechanism(s) underlying these differences is unclear, but may be related to the atypical biochemical profile of zolpidem.\r"

  ".U": "91087166\r", 
  ".W": "S-nitrosothiols are potent vasodilators in vivo and in vitro, and have recently been proposed as possible endogenous precursors of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). NO release from S-nitrosothiols has generally been assumed to be spontaneous, but this has not been proven. This hypothesis was examined by altering the NO release profiles of two S-nitrosothiols, those of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and S-nitroso-glutathione (GSNO), and observing their relaxation potency on isolated endothelium-denuded rat aortic rings. Spontaneous degradation of SNAP and GSNO in tissue bathing medium (monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography) and the associated NO release (assessed by chemiluminescence detection of headspace NO) were enhanced in the presence of 100 microM N-acetylpenicillamine and inhibited in the presence of 100 U/ml superoxide dismutase. However, the relaxant effects of SNAP and GSNO were enhanced in the presence of superoxide dismutase, and diminished in the presence of N-acetylpenicillamine. In addition, the relaxation potencies of SNAP, GSNO, S-nitrosocystein, S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine and S-nitroso-coenzyme A were not correlated with spontaneous NO generation. These findings therefore argue against spontaneous liberation of NO as a predominant mechanism of S-nitrosothiol action. The highly polar SNAP, GSNO, S-nitrosocysteine and S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine (octanol, pH 7.4 buffer partition coefficient from less than .025-.052) and the bulky and polar S-nitroso-coenzyme A (MW 797) have similar relaxation potencies, indicating that intracellular penetration of intact S-nitrosothiols may not be required for activity. NO generation from SNAP was examined in subcellular fractions of bovine coronary arterial smooth muscle cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Exposure of these prelabeled minces to phenylephrine and (-)-norepinephrine revealed that accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates was selectively reduced by 20 to 30% in the thalamus and cerebral cortex of the oldest age group. Analysis of concentration-response and competition binding curves indicated that this decrease was due to diminished agonist efficacy rather than diminished receptor affinity. The reduction in responsiveness to phenylephrine and (-)-norepinephrine in the cerebral cortex and the lack of any changes in the hippocampus parallel previously reported changes in the density of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors with aging. These data indicate that the ability of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonists to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis is reduced in some, but not all, brain regions of aged Fischer 344 rats.\r"

  ".W": "Behavioral effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and the competitive NMDA antagonist cis-4-phosphonomethyl-2-piperidine-carboxylic acid (CGS 19755) were studied in pigeons. NMDA decreased responding under a fixed-ratio schedule of food presentation and was 8000 times more potent administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) as compared to intramuscularly (i.m.). CGS 19755 was 870 times more potent in producing catalepsy when administered i.c.v.; however, the duration of catalepsy was similar by the two routes of administration. Administered i.m. CGS 19755 decreased response rates only at doses that also produced catalepsy; administered i.c.v. some doses of CGS 19755 decreased responding without producing other behavioral effects. Rate-decreasing effects of i.m. NMDA were attenuated by i.m. CGS 19755; however, when CGS 19755 was administered i.c.v., there was little or no antagonism of NMDA. Rate-decreasing effects of i.c.v. NMDA were not attenuated by i.m. or i.c.v. CGS 19755 up to doses that produced catalepsy or eliminated responding. The large difference in potency between i.m. and i.c.v. administration for NMDA and for CGS 19755, as well as the slower onset of catalepsy when CGS 19755 was administered i.m., suggests these compounds do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier when administered parenterally. The inability of CGS 19755 to attenuate the rate-decreasing effects of NMDA when CGS 19755 or NMDA was administered i.c.v. suggests NMDA might decrease responding by different mechanisms when administered i.m. or i.c.v. in pigeons. Together these results indicate antagonism of NMDA in this study, and perhaps in other studies, when both NMDA and CGS 19755 were administered parenterally, might result from a peripherally mediated interaction. Moreover, this agonist-antagonist interaction is not a simple, competitive antagonism.\r"

Inhibition studies using [125I] Bolton-Hunter-labeled CCK-8 show that SNF 8702 has over 4,000-fold greater affinity for CCK receptors in guinea pig cortex relative to those in guinea pig pancreas. SNF 8702 was tritium-labeled to a specific activity of 23.7 Ci/mmol and its binding properties characterized for guinea pig brain membrane preparations. [3H]SNF 8702 binds to a single site with high affinity (Kd = 0.69-0.90 nM) in guinea pig cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and pons-medulla. Of these four tissues, the highest receptor density was measured in the cortex (86 fmol/mg of protein) and the lowest in the pons-medulla (22 fmol/mg of protein). In contrast to findings of single-site binding in some brain regions, evidence for CCK-B receptor heterogeneity is observed under other conditions. [3H]SNF 8702 binding to membranes prepared from whole guinea pig brain shows biphasic association kinetics at a concentration of 2.0 nM consistent with the presence of binding site heterogeneity. Binding site heterogeneity is consistently observed for [3H]SNF 8702 binding to guinea pig whole brain membranes in saturation studies where a high-affinity site (Kd = 0.31 nM) is distinguished from a low-affinity site (Kd = 3.3 nM). Binding site heterogeneity is also observed for the midbrain-thalamic region. CCK-B receptor heterogeneity is suggested by the effect of the guanyl nucleotide analogue, guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), on [3H]SNF 8702 binding to CCK-B receptors in the cerebellum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of specific mu and kappa tolerance and withdrawal on the functional secretion of the HPA axis were evaluated in this study. Adult male rats were injected s.c. twice daily with saline, morphine or U50,488 for 5 days. Serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) or corticosterone (CS) were determined by radioimmunoassay as measures of HPA axis function. Tolerance to morphine (10 mg/kg) and U50,488 (1 mg/kg), but no cross-tolerance, was observed suggesting the development of mu- or kappa-specific tolerance, respectively. Tolerance does not occur at the pituitary or adrenal levels after these paradigms because ACTH and CS responses to exogenous corticotropin-releasing factor and ACTH, respectively, were not attenuated. CS secretion in response to novelty stress was not affected by either chronic opiate treatment, but the circadian variation of CS levels was slightly blunted after chronic morphine. In contrast, the elevation of CS secretion by quipazine (0.5 mg/kg) and physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) was attenuated after chronic U50,488, but not morphine administration. Both spontaneous and antagonist-precipitated withdrawal from morphine, but not U50,488, resulted in elevation of CS levels. Low doses of morphine suppressed morphine abstinence-induced CS hypersecretion, whereas, U50,488 and clonidine had no effect. In conclusion, alterations of HPA axis function occur during chronic mu or kappa opiate administration that are receptor-specific and involve multiple neural controls of the HPA axis.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) by muscarinic cholinergic and serotoninergic agonists was measured in rat brain cortical membranes by using exogenously supplied substrates. Serotonin, tryptamine, 5-fluorotryptamine and 5-methyltryptamine stimulated PLC with EC50 values of 1.7, 11.2, 15.0, and 29.4 microM, respectively. Maximal PLC stimulation by serotoninergic agonists, which were all equally efficacious, was about 30% of that attained by carbachol. Ketanserin blocked serotoninergic but not cholinergic activation of PLC, whereas, conversely, atropine blocked the latter but not the former response. The rank order of potency for muscarinic agonists was oxotremorine-M greater than pilocarpine = arecoline greater than carbachol = bethanecol. Unlike the case with tissue slices, all of these muscarinic agonists exhibited full efficacy in this assay of PLC stimulation. Activation of PLC by the neurotransmitters or their analogs was dependent on the addition of guanosine 3'-O-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S). Stimulation of PLC by GTP gamma S alone or in combination with 5-methyltryptamine had an apparent EC50 of about 0.4 microM. However, when carbachol or other muscarinic agonists were used, the EC50 for GTP gamma S was significantly lower. We have previously shown that dopamine working through D1 receptors inhibits the PLC response to carbachol by preventing this shift in the apparent EC50 for GTP gamma S. Dopamine did not have a similar effect on 5-methyltryptamine stimulation of PLC. The results indicate that the postreceptor mechanisms of PLC activation are distinct for muscarinic as opposed to serotoninergic agonists in brain cortex.\r"

  ".W": "This study reports the activity of a structurally novel excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, LY233053 [cis-(+-)-4-[(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)methyl]piperidine-2-carboxylic acid], the first tetrazole-containing competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist. LY233053 potently inhibited NMDA receptor binding to rat brain membranes as shown by the in vitro displacement of [3H] CGS19755 (IC50 = 107 +/- 7 nM). No appreciable affinity in [3H]alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) or [3H]kainate binding assays was observed (IC50 values greater than 10,000 nM). In vitro NMDA receptor antagonist activity was further demonstrated by selective inhibition of NMDA-induced depolarization in cortical wedges (IC50 = 4.2 +/- 0.4 microM vs. 40 microM NMDA). LY233053 was effective after in vivo systemic administration in a number of animal models. In neonatal rats, LY233053 selectively blocked NMDA-induced convulsions (ED50 = 14.5 mg/kg i.p.) with a relatively short duration of action (2-4 hr). In pigeons, LY233053 potently antagonized (ED50 = 1.3 mg/kg i.m.) the behavioral suppressant effects of 10 mg/kg of NMDA. However, a dose of 160 mg/kg, i.m., was required to produce phencyclidine-like catalepsy in pigeons. In mice, LY233053 protected against maximal electroshock-induced seizures at lower doses (ED50 = 19.9 mg/kg i.p.) than those that impaired horizontal screen performance (ED50 = 40.9 mg/kg i.p.). Cholinergic and GABAergic neuronal degenerations after striatal infusion of NMDA were prevented by single or multiple i.p. doses of LY233053. In summary, the antagonist activity of LY233053 after systemic administration demonstrates potential therapeutic value in conditions of neuronal cell loss due to NMDA receptor excitotoxicity. The relatively short duration of action of LY233053 may make this compound particularly advantageous as a neuroprotective agent in the treatment of acute conditions such as cerebral ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of SK&F 95587 (4[2-(benzenesulfonamido)-ethyl] phenoxyacetic acid), a thromboxane (TX) receptor blocking agent, on bronchoconstrictor responses were investigated in paralyzed, anesthetized, mechanically ventilated cats. Intravenous injections of the TXA2 receptor mimics, U-46619 [(15S)-hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta5Z,13E-dienoic acid] and U-44069 (9,11-dideoxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-epoxymethano PGF2 alpha), produced dose-related increases in transpulmonary pressure and lung resistance and decreases in dynamic compliance. After administration of SK&F 95587, 5 mg/kg i.v., bronchoconstrictor responses to U-46619 and U-44069 were reduced markedly, whereas airway responses to prostaglandin (PG)F2 alpha, serotonin, PGD2 or the PGD2 metabolite, 11 beta-PGF2 alpha, were not altered. The duration of action of SK&F 95587 was greater than 3 hr, and the blockade was overcome when 10-fold larger doses of the TXA2 mimics were administered. Bronchoconstrictor responses to platelet-activating factor (PAF) were blocked by SK&F 95587 and by the novel PAF receptor antagonist, BN 50730. BN 50730 also blocked the fall in systemic arterial pressure in response to PAF. However, BN 50730 did not influence airway responses to U-46619, PGF2 alpha, PGD2 or serotonin and had no effect on baseline bronchomotor tone or arterial pressure. The PAF receptor antagonism with BN 50730 was overcome when 10-fold larger doses of PAF were administered and the dose-response curves for changes in lung resistance and dynamic compliance were shifted to the right in a parallel manner. The present data suggest that SK&F 95587 has selective TX receptor blocking activity, and that BN 50730 has selective PAF receptor blocking properties in the airways of the cat. The present data also provide support for the hypothesis that bronchoconstrictor responses to PAF are mediated by specific receptors, which are coupled to a phospholipase and, when activated, result in the release of TXA2 and contraction of airway smooth muscle.\r"

  ".U": "91087178\r", 
  ".W": "N alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester (BAEE) is a vasorelaxant which resembles an arginine-containing peptide; its action may be partially endothelium-dependent. Because L-arginine (ARG) has little potency as a vasorelaxant, it has been proposed that an arginine-containing peptide, rather than free ARG, is the immediate precursor of endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide (EDRF/NO). In the present study we have characterized pharmacologically the vasorelaxant effect of BAEE and assessed the ability of BAEE to serve as a substrate for EDRF/NO synthesis. BAEE elicited a concentration-dependent vasorelaxation of guinea pig pulmonary artery (EC50 of 0.36 +/- 0.05 mM). This vasorelaxation was neither antagonized by -NG-methyl-L-arginine (100 microM), a competitive inhibitor of EDRF/NO synthesis from ARG, nor potentiated by superoxide dismutase (60 U/ml), a superoxide anion scavenger that prolongs EDRF lifetime. Additionally, compound LY 83583 (1 microM) and methylene blue (10 microM), inhibitors of soluble guanylyl cyclase, failed to block BAEE-induced vasorelaxation. Moreover, endothelium removal potentiated the vasorelaxant effect of BAEE 3-fold. Thus, BAEE-induced vasorelaxation is mediated by a direct action on vascular smooth muscle that is unrelated to EDRF/NO synthesis. Furthermore, ARG, but not BAEE, overcame the inhibition by NG-methyl-L-arginine of the acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent cyclic GMP accumulation in guinea pig aortic rings and of A23187-induced nitrite formation by cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (nitrite is a convenient indicator of NO biosynthesis). Thus, BAEE cannot substitute for ARG as a substrate for EDRF/NO biosynthesis. Collectively, our findings support the notion that free ARG, rather than an arginine-containing peptide related to BAEE, is the immediate biosynthetic precursor of EDRF/NO.\r"

  ".W": "The previous demonstration of sigma receptors localized in the mucosa and the submucosal plexus of the duodenum led us to investigate the activity of two specific sigma (sigma H) receptor ligands, di (ortho-tolyl) guanidine (DTG) and (+) N-allyl normetazocine (d-NANM) on the alkaline secretion of the duodenum in anesthetized rats. DTG (0.25-2 mg/kg, i.v.) and d-NANM (0.5-5 mg/kg, i.v.) induced a dose-related increase of bicarbonate output, from a basal level of 7.6 +/- 0.1 microEq/cm/hr to a stimulated plateau of 14.1 +/- 0.2 and 14.2 +/- 0.2 microEq/cm/hr, respectively, for the next 2 hr. In contrast, the venous injection of I-NANM (5 mg/kg) did not significantly stimulate duodenal bicarbonate output. Intravenous administration of naloxone (0.2 mg/kg) failed to modify the response to both DTG and d-NANM, whereas haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) abolished the response to both drugs. The response to DTG was unchanged after indomethacin (0.25 mg/kg), yohimbine (2 mg/kg), atropine (1 mg/kg), sulpiride (1 mg/kg) or SCH 23,390 (0.45 mg/kg), and partly decreased after prazosin (1 mg/kg). Hexamethonium (1 mg/kg), and tetrodotoxin (5 micrograms/kg) reduced the response to DTG, respectively, by 79% (P less than 0.01) and 91% (P less than 0.01), whereas bilateral vagotomy suppressed it. The cholecystokininA receptor antagonist (-)L364,718 decreased the response to DTG by 91% (P less than 0.01). None of the antagonists changed the basal bicarbonate output but vagotomy, which induced a 52% (P less than 0.01) decrease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91087180\r", 
  ".W": "In hamster insulinoma (HIT) cells, maitotoxin (MTX) induces a time-dependent and concentration-dependent release of insulin that requires the presence of extracellular calcium. The response is nearly completely blocked by cinnarizine and cadmium, but is not inhibited by the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine or by manganese. MTX induces 45Ca+ uptake in these cells in a dose-dependent mode, and the uptake is blocked with cinnarizine, nifedipine and cadmium, and is partially inhibited by manganese. MTX induces phosphoinositide breakdown in HIT cells, and the response is partially blocked by cadmium, but is not affected by nifedipine, cinnarizine or manganese. High concentrations of potassium ions also induce insulin release and calcium uptake in HIT cells. Both effects of potassium are blocked partially by nifedipine, cadmium and cinnarizine. High concentrations of potassium do not induce phosphoinositide breakdown in HIT cells. The results suggest that MTX-elicited release of insulin is attained by two mechanisms: 1) a nifedipine-sensitive action, which results from MTX-induced activation of L-type calcium channels, which can be mimicked with high potassium concentrations; and 2) a nifedipine-insensitive action, which may be initiated by the activation of phosphoinositide breakdown by MTX. Such an activation of phospholipase C would result in the formation of 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate, a release of intracellular calcium and then release of insulin to the extracellular space. Cinnarizine is proposed to block both MTX-elicited mechanisms, the first by blockade of calcium channels and the second by blocking 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate-induced release of internal calcium. Either mechanism alone appears capable of eliciting release of insulin.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which cocaine produces sudden cardiac death has not been elucidated, but clinical evidence indicates that it may be due to a direct or indirect action on coronary vessels. The present study was designed to compare the responses of the isolated left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and femoral artery taken from untreated dogs with the response of these vessels taken from dogs administered cocaine (1 mg/kg i.v.) daily for 4 weeks. The actions of norepinephrine, U-46619 (a thromboxane A2 analog) and serotonin (5-HT) were evaluated. The direct vascular action of cocaine was also determined. Morphology of the blood vessels was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Chronic cocaine treatment significantly increased the sensitivity and maximum response of the femoral artery to norepinephrine, U-46619 and 5-HT. The sensitivity of the LAD coronary artery to U-46619 and 5-HT and the maximum response to U-46619 and 5-HT were also enhanced. Vasoconstriction produced by cocaine was not dose dependent and only occurred at high concentrations (10(-5)-10(-4) M). Morphology of the vessels was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Femoral arteries from cocaine-treated dogs exhibited loss of endothelial integrity, areas of excessive endothelial cell sloughing and thrombus formation. LAD coronary arteries exhibited only areas of enhanced endothelial cell sloughing. The results of this study indicate that the femoral artery and the LAD coronary artery are more sensitive to endogenous vasoactive substances after chronic cocaine use, which may result in enhanced peripheral vasoconstriction and cardiac ischemia. Morphological results demonstrate femoral arterial thrombosis associated with cocaine use.\r"

  ".U": "91087183\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of amiodarone on the respiration of isolated mouse liver mitochondria have been determined. Amiodarone (200 microM) had a biphasic effect on state 4 respiration supported by either glutamate plus malate or succinate. Initially, the respiratory rate was increased. This stimulatory effect was not prevented by oligomycin (an inhibitor of ATP synthase). It was associated with marked accumulation of amiodarone in the mitochondria, and with collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This initial uncoupling effect was followed by a progressive decrease in the state 4 respiration rate, leading eventually to marked inhibition. Preincubation for 5 min with amiodarone (200 microM) also decreased markedly ADP-stimulated (state 3) respiration, ATP production and dinitrophenol-stimulated (uncoupled) respiration supported by glutamate plus malate (which donate electrons to complex I), and respiration supported by succinate (which donate electrons to complex II), but did not affect respiration supported by duroquinol (donating electrons to complex III) or by ascorbate plus N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (donating electrons to cytochrome c). Preincubation with amiodarone (150-200 microM) decreased markedly respiration mediated by fatty acids of various chain length and respiration mediated by citrate, a tricarboxylic acid cycle substrate. We conclude that amiodarone has a dual effect on mitochondrial respiration. The initial uncoupling effect is probably due to the entry of protonated amiodarone, releasing a proton in the matrix. Accumulation of amiodarone soon leads to inhibition of the respiratory chain at the levels of complex I and complex II and to decreased ATP formation.\r"

Human hepatic microsomes produced monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and 3-hydroxylidocaine (3-OH-LID) from lidocaine. In a reconstituted system with dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, P-450NF efficiently produced MEGX. P-450PA was not efficient in lidocaine N-deethylation (formation of MEGX) but produced 3-OH-LID. P-450NF and P-450MP did not produce 3-OH-LID. Lidocaine N-deethylation activity of P-450NF was enhanced in a modified reconstituted system with a phospholipid mixture and sodium cholate. P-450NF appears to be an ortholog to rat P450 PB-1 (P450IIIA2). Anti-P450 PB-1 antibody cross-reacted with P-450NF and efficiently inhibited lidocaine N-deethylation in human hepatic microsomes. The correlation of lidocaine N-deethylation activity with the concentration of P-450NF determined immunochemically with anti-P450 PB-1 antibody was good (r = 0.81). In addition, correlation between P-450NF content estimated with anti-P450 PB-1 and anti-P-450NF preparations was good (r = 0.96). These results suggest that rat P450 PB-1 and human P-450NF have closely related properties and P-450NF is the major enzyme involved in lidocaine N-deethylation in human hepatic microsomes.\r"

Strips of dog femoral artery or saphenous vein contracted with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were relaxed by 100 microM concentrations of MDL 27,032, as well as by other known inhibitors of PDEs [3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and papaverine], myosin light chain kinase (W-7) and protein kinase C (H-7 and polymyxin B). In contrast to 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and papaverine, MDL 27,032 was either inactive or weak as an inhibitor of purified PDE types I, II, IVa and IVb. Similarly, it was a weak inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase. However, MDL 27,032 was a significantly more potent inhibitor of protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase in cytosolic extracts of dog vein. Kinetic experiments utilizing purified rat brain protein kinase C revealed that inhibition with MDL 27,032 was competitive with Mg(++)-ATP (Ki 24 microM) and noncompetitive with phospholipid, diacylglycerol, PMA, calcium or substrate proteins. Inhibition of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was also competitive with Mg(++)-ATP (Ki 14.3 microM).

  ".W": "Previous studies involving local microinjection of drugs that interfere with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition have led to the suggestion that endogenous GABA suppresses the activity of a sympatho-excitatory mechanism in the dorsomedial hypothalamus in rats. In this study, microdialysis was used to assess and to alter pharmacologically extracellular-levels of GABA within this region while simultaneously monitoring heart rate and blood pressure. In anesthetized rats, local microdialysis for 15 min with 2.5, 10 and 40 mM nipecotic acid, an inhibitor of GABA uptake, caused concentration-related increases in GABA and taurine in the extracellular space, but no significant change in heart rate or arterial pressure. Similar perfusion with 37.5, 75 and 150 mM KCl caused concentration-related increases in GABA as well as aspartate, glutamate, taurine, glycine and alanine. Only modest, variable increases in heart rate and no effect on arterial pressure were observed during the perfusions with high potassium. In conscious rats, unilateral microdialysis of the dorsomedial hypothalamus with 0.5 mM nipecotic acid for 2 to 2.5 hr before stress coupled with contralateral microinjection of muscimol (88 pmol/250 nl) 5 min before stress significantly reduced air stress-induced tachycardia; this reduction in tachycardia was associated with markedly elevated levels of GABA in dialysates collected from the dorsomedial hypothalamus. Neither treatment alone significantly influenced stress-induced increases in heart rate, although perfusion with nipecotic acid alone evoked similar elevations in extracellular GABA. These results suggest that extracellular levels of endogenous GABA in the dorsomedial hypothalamus may regulate the cardiovascular response to stress.\r"

However, since P-450 inhibition often is followed by P-450 induction, which would enhance acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, the possibility of a biphasic modulation of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity by interferons was investigated. Outbred male CD-1 mice of various ages, and young inbred male C57BL/6 mice were given the interferon inducer, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I-C), 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, followed 1 to 48 days later by a single dose of acetaminophen, 300 to 450 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Hepatotoxicity was assessed by the peak plasma concentration of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurring between 0 and 48 hr after acetaminophen treatment. Poly I-C inhibited the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen given within 8 days, with maximal inhibition between 1 and 4 days. Conversely, a maximal 7-fold enhancement of ALT concentration was observed in CD-1 mice when 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen was given 32 days after Poly I-C (P less than 0.05). In the C57BL/6 strain, Poly I-C inhibited the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen when given within 16 days, whereas a maximal 20-fold enhancement of ALT concentration was observed when 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen was given 24 days after Poly I-C (P less than 0.05). The mechanism of toxicologic enhancement was examined in male C57BL/6 mice using the same treatment regimen. Biochemical assessment of hepatotoxicity was confirmed by detailed histologic evaluation. Plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Acetaminophen bioactivation was quantified by production of the glutathione-derived cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates of acetaminophen. Poly I-C pretreatment produced a 5-fold increase in acetaminophen-induced ALT release (P less than 0.05), which correlated with histologic evidence of centrilobular necrosis. Poly I-C pretreatment produced respective 3-fold and 1.3-fold increases in the production of cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates (P less than 0.05), which correlated with peak ALT concentrations (cysteine, r = 0.92, P less than 0.001; mercapturic acid, r = 0.75, P = 0.006). Thus, the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen can be inhibited when given within days after interferon induction, and conversely enhanced when given after several weeks. The toxicologic enhancement appears to be due to increased P-450-catalyzed bioactivation of acetaminophen.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of two angiotensin receptor antagonists on neuromodulatory and prostaglandin-producing effects of angiotensin II in the rabbit isolated vas deferens because prior studies have established that angiotensins selectively influence the two neural events, one being adrenergic and the other nonadrenergic. Angiotensin II increased adrenergic neurotransmission and prostaglandin E synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner while depressing nonadrenergic neurotransmission. The [1-Sarcosine, 8-Alanine]-angiotensin II preferentially antagonized adrenergic neuromodulatory effects of angiotensin II. In contrast, the nonadrenergic neuromodulatory and prostaglandin E-releasing effects of angiotensin II were suppressed by [1-Sarcosine, 8-Alanine]-angiotensin II to a lesser extent. The nonpeptide angiotensin receptor antagonist, Dupont 753 (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[2(1)-(1-H-tetrazol-5-yl) biphenyl-4-yl)methyl] imidazole, potassium salt, exhibited the opposite selectivity. It eliminated the depression of nonadrenergic neurotransmission without significantly altering the potentiation of adrenergic neurotransmission caused by angiotensin II. The angiotensin-induced stimulation of prostaglandin E synthesis was also eliminated by this antagonist. These data suggest that angiotensin effects in the vas deferens are mediated by at least two types of angiotensin receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Acetaminophen (500 mg/kg i.p.) induced hepatotoxicity in fasted ICR mice in vivo. Acetaminophen also caused a long-lasting 50% reduction of the hepatic ATP content, an irreversible loss of hepatic xanthine dehydrogenase activity and a transient increase of the xanthine oxidase activity. All effects occurred before parenchymal cell damage, i.e., the release of cellular enzymes. The hepatic content of GSH and GSSG was initially depleted by acetaminophen without affecting the GSSG:GSH ratio (1:200), however, during the recovery phase of the hepatic GSH levels the GSSG content increased faster than GSH, resulting in a GSSG:GSH ratio of 1:18 24 h after acetaminophen administration. The mitochondrial GSSG content increased from 2% in controls to greater than 20% in acetaminophen-treated mice. The extremely elevated tissue GSSG levels were accompanied by a 4-fold increase of the plasma GSSG concentrations but not by an enhanced biliary efflux, although hepatic GSSG formation and biliary excretion were not affected by acetaminophen. Allopurinol protected dose-dependently against acetaminophen-induced cell injury, the loss of ATP and the increase of the GSSG content in the total liver and in the mitochondrial compartment without inhibiting reactive metabolite formation. High, protective as well as low, nonprotective doses of allopurinol almost completely inhibited hepatic xanthine oxidase and dehydrogenase activity, but only high doses prevented the increase of the mitochondrial GSSG content. The data indicate a long-lasting, primarily intracellular oxidant stress during the progression phase of acetaminophen-induced cell necrosis. The protective effect of allopurinol is unlikely to involve the inhibition of reactive oxygen formation by xanthine oxidase but could be the result of its antioxidant property.\r"
