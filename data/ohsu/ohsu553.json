Images of polyalanine, an amino acid polymer, show the potential of the AFM for revealing the structure of molecules important in biology and medicine.

Moreover, in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of known chemosensitizers, such as N-acetylated sugars and mucin, these optima shift to 5, 15, 30, and 40 hertz, frequencies that correspond to the movements of swimming prey. Hence, chemoreceptors for these substances tune cnidocyte mechanoreceptors to frequencies that match the movements of the prey.\r"

Inhibitors of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) suppressed both aggregation and the elevation of histamine content, whereas DPPE inhibited aggregation only. In saponin-permeabilized platelets, added histamine reversed the inhibition by DPPE or HDC inhibitors on aggregation induced by PMA or collagen. The results indicate a role for histamine as an intracellular messenger, which in platelets promotes aggregation.\r"

The facilitation undergoes activity-dependent enhancement that is thought to contribute to classical conditioning of the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex. Inhibition of the sensory neurons has now also been shown to undergo activity-dependent enhancement when action potential activity in the sensory neurons is paired with inhibitory transmitter. This effect appears to involve an amplification of the same cellular mechanisms that are involved in normal presynaptic inhibition. These results suggest that activity-dependent enhancement may be a general type of associative cellular mechanism.\r"

In this study, the defensive behaviors of infant rhesus monkeys exposed to humans were characterized. It was observed that the direction of the human's gaze is a potent cue for the infant. Infants separated from their mothers were active and emitted frequent distress vocalizations. When a human entered the room but did not look at the infant, it became silent and froze in one position. If the human stared at the infant, it responded with aggressive barking. Alterations of the opiate system affected the frequency of the infant's distress calls without affecting barking and freezing, whereas benzodiazepine administration selectively reduced barking and freezing. This suggests that opiate and benzodiazepine systems regulate specific defensive behaviors in primates and that these systems work together to mediate behavioral responses important for survival.\r"

Overall operative mortality of 411 hepatic resection was 3.2 per cent. A high operative risk was noted in patients with gross cirrhosis, trauma, abscess, and large malignant tumors. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of patients with primary hepatic malignancy were 68.5 per cent, 45.1 per cent, and 31.9 per cent, respectively. Survival rates of patients with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma were significantly higher than those of patients with nonfibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. Eighteen patients survived more than 5 years after hepatic resection, 14 of whom had been treated by trisegmentectomy. The most extensive partial hepatectomy, such as right and left trisegmentectomy rather than extended lobectomies, should be used to remove massive tumors with adequate tumor-free margins.\r"

  ".U": "89187311\r", 
  ".W": "Overall, hepatic resection appears to be an important means of curing patients with metastatic colorectal cancer isolated to the liver. The only absolute contraindication to surgery was the impossibility of a radical removal of tumor: if residual disease will remain after the hepatic resection, this operation is not indicated. A possible second contraindication to surgery is the presence of tumor in the hepatic or celiac lymph nodes. Such metastases from liver metastases signal a biologic grade of tumor that is almost sure to spread to other sites. However, one patient of the 25 in this group did survive long term when positive lymph node groups were dissected. Further clinical experience with this form of the disease along with trials of regional adjuvant therapies such as intraperitoneal chemotherapy may be needed. The presence of extrahepatic metastases at the time of liver resection should be considered a relative contraindication to this surgery, but if the patient can be made clinically disease free, long-term disease-free survival may result. It seems imperative that all patients with hepatic metastases be evaluated by an experienced hepatic surgeon for a curative resection. If the patient has between one and four metastases, a 25 per cent long-term disease-free survival rate can be expected. Patients who have a radical resection of more than four metastases should be considered to be in an experimental group in whom more data are needed. In our current state of knowledge, making such patients clinically disease free is their only chance for long-term survival. Other factors besides the number of metastases that will affect the prognosis of the patient include the disease-free interval between colorectal resection and liver resection, the pathologic margin of resection on the liver specimen, and the presence or absence of mesenteric lymph node metastases from the primary cancer. These factors should be considered when determining the prognosis in a given patient and should be used as stratification variables in prospective trials. However, from our analysis of available data, these factors should not be considered contraindications to hepatic resection.\r"

Ten patients proved to have previously unsuspected extrahepatic nodal metastases at laparotomy for pump insertion. 5-FUDR was given in 14 day cycles for three months.

Forty-three individuals with benign gynecologic diseases served as controls. There were three groups. Group 1 included 23 untreated patients who had LASA-P values above normal before debulking operations. Group 2 consisted of 12 patients who completed 12 courses of chemotherapy after debulking operations and presented with negative findings at second look operation (SLO). LASA-P levels were measured in these patients prior to SLO. Eight of 12 patients had normal LASA-P values for a specificity rate of 67 per cent. Four patients had elevated values with no clinical evidence of disease. Group 3 had 17 patients who failed to respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy after initial debulking procedures. All patients in this group had persistent or recurrent disease that was documented at re-exploration or at SLO. Elevated LASA-P levels were noted in 14 of 17 patients for a sensitivity rate of 82 per cent. Rising LASA-P values in serial samples were the only signs of disease recurrence in three of five patients who completed 12 courses of chemotherapy and in whom SLO showed surgical evidence of disease. The predictive value for positive and negative results for all patients were 92.2 and 72.7 per cent, respectively. In spite of the relatively low sensitivity and specificity rates in groups 2 and 3, LASA-P can be used successfully as a valuable adjunct to monitor the course of the disease during treatment in patients with advanced carcinoma of the ovaries.\r"

Autotransfusion accounted for 40 per cent of the total transfusion requirements of the patients and proved to be cost effective for the entire study group. Fear of dissemination of tumor has limited the use of intraoperative autotransfusion during surgical procedures for carcinoma. Analysis of our data failed to define any evidence for dissemination of tumor caused by autotransfusion in patients who underwent radical cystectomy.\r"

We reviewed our experience with 41 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus within 24 centimeters of the incisor teeth to address this issue. Thirty-seven patients had squamous cell carcinoma, three had adenocarcinoma and one patient had a mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Seventeen patients underwent surgical therapy, which consisted of a resection in 15, colonic bypass in one patient and extracorporeal bypass in one. Ten patients underwent postoperative radiation therapy. Radiation therapy was the primary treatment in 23 patients and chemotherapy alone in one patient. The three month mortality rate was similar for patients with tumor resection and for those receiving radiation therapy as the primary treatment. Median survival time for patients undergoing resection and adjuvant radiation therapy was 12 months and seven months for those receiving only irradiation. Statistical analyses were not performed because patients with radiation only had more advanced disease, invalidating comparison. In terms of palliation, ten of the patients who had radiation therapy could eat solid food, seven could only swallow liquids and six had persistent, complete obstruction. All 12 of the survivors who had a resection were able to eat solid food. Although the one month mortality rate is higher for those treated surgically than with radiation therapy, the three month mortality rates are similar. Surgical treatment provides better palliation and a reasonable survival time and is preferred for patients with resectable disease who are physiologically fit enough to undergo operation. A benefit of postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy is undefined but probably present.\r"

A cadaver dissection of the sacrospinous ligament was also performed with the same approach used at operation. This was done to understand better the relationships involved, to identify areas of potential complications and to improve the technique used. A dense fascia covers the coccygeus muscle, and care should be taken not to confuse this with the sacrospinous ligament. The possibility of injury to the nearby vessels and nerves can be avoided with the careful placement of suture through the sacrospinous ligament and two fingerbreadths medial to its insertion on the ischial spine. At the conclusion of the suspension, the vaginal apex should be intimately attached to the coccygeus muscle and sacrospinous ligament complex. The use of absorbable suture has been recommended by some, but the success of the procedure may be increased by using permanent suture. If anatomic relationships of the nearby structures are remembered, sacrospinous ligament suspension can be a safe, effective and relatively simple procedure for the correction of severe prolapse of the vaginal vault.\r"

Cause, bacterial infection and clinical manifestations were determined. An ultrasonogram was positive in 27 of 29 patients; computed tomographic scan was diagnostic in 20 of 23 patients, and radionuclide studies were positive in eight of 13 patients. Abscesses were confined to the right lobe in 19 patients, to the left lobe in six and were diffuse in eight. In the group of patients with abscesses developing from a biliary route, one patient was successfully managed by roentgenologically controlled drainage while three others required subsequent surgical drainage. Five of seven patients in the biliary route category who were treated with primary surgical drainage were permanently cured. Twelve patients had an abscess emanating from the portal route. In five of these, drainage under roentgenologic control was successful. Two patients upon whom the procedure failed subsequently underwent drainage at operation. Five had primary surgical drainage, and two of these died. All nine patients with post-traumatic, cryptogenic abscesses or an abscess evolving from an arterial route were successfully drained surgically. Three patients with multiple or diffuse abscesses were successfully treated by primary hepatic resection. Refined roentgenologic techniques established the diagnosis of pyogenic abscess in almost all instances. Roentgenologically controlled drainage may be therapeutic in some patients, but surgical drainage remains the standard. Resection has been used as primary treatment in selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "Sepsis is a common occurrence during long term transhepatic biliary drainage. Most of these episodes are attributed to cholangitis, are relatively minor and can be managed nonoperatively. During a 42 month period, nine patients who had sepsis develop after biliary drainage were found to have acute cholecystitis, a complication not previously noted after this procedure. Seven of the nine patients had an underlying malignant lesion, and three of these patients had undergone percutaneous biliary drainage for palliation of unresectable or metastatic tumor. Eight of the nine patients underwent cholecystectomy whereas percutaneous cholecystostomy was used in one patient with an unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. Operative and pathologic evidence of acute cholecystitis was present in all, but only two patients had gallstones. Seven patients survived the surgical procedure and were discharged at an average of 11.7 days postoperatively. Based on this series, we propose that acute cholecystitis should be considered as a source of sepsis in patients undergoing biliary drainage who do not respond to antibiotics and catheter manipulations. Moreover, cholecystectomy should be performed at the time of laparotomy, if prolonged transhepatic drainage is planned for unresectable malignant conditions.\r"

They are potent mediators of inflammation and may contribute to secondary injury in the central nervous system. All mammalian tissue including cerebral cortex is capable of synthesizing these; however, clear documentation of leukotriene formation in the spinal cord is lacking. We subjected 55 rabbits to weight drops of 200, 300, and 400 gm/cm, respectively, on an exposed spinal cord. The traumatized spinal cord was removed after periods of 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours. Radioimmunoassay for leukotriene B-4 was then performed on the specimens. Significant (p less than 0.05) elevation was noted in the 200 and 300 gm/cm groups with peak levels occurring in the first 4 hours. The 400 gm/cm group showed significant depression of values below control levels from 2 to 24 hours. We conclude that in sublethal central nervous system injury leukotrienes are produced in significant amounts and may contribute to secondary spinal cord injury.\r"

Short-term outcome, morbidity, and mortality are consistently favorable in several large series. The long-term success of this procedure is presumed but has not been established objectively. To examine the late results of this operation, 46 infants and children were carefully evaluated more than 5 years after NFP (mean, 6.7 years). Evaluation included parental interview, physical examination, upper gastrointestinal series, and esophageal pH monitoring. The mean age at the time of operation was 4.13 years. Fifty-seven percent of the patients had significant neurologic impairment, and 80% had at least one serious additional medical problem. Twenty-four percent of the children died during the period of follow-up--all but one death related to serious underlying medical problems. Of the 35 survivors, 26 (74.3%) have no symptoms; five (14.3%) have mild symptoms potentially referable to GER that necessitate little if any treatment; four (11.5%) have had symptomatic recurrence of GER necessitating repeat fundoplication. Three of these patients now have no symptoms. Forty-five percent of the patients had at least one postoperative complication. NFP provides efficacious, long-term treatment of GER in infants and children, with acceptable morbidity. Mortality in this group of children is related primarily to associated diseases rather than to GER.\r"

A prenodal lymphatic vessel was cannulated in group I (n = 7), and baseline (BL) lung lymph flow (QL) and lymph (CL) and plasma (CP) protein concentrations were measured. The animals' lungs were then ventilated with wood smoke for 5 minutes. Left atrial pressure (Pla) was increased above baseline (mean 16.7 +/- 2.2 mm Hg), and the ratio of CL to CP was used to assess endothelial permeability at high lymph flows. There was little change in either QL (BL: 27 +/- 9; SI: 27 +/- 5 microliters/min) or CL/CP (BL: 0.76 +/- 0.03; SI: 0.74 +/- 0.02) after SI at normal Pla. Elevation of Pla caused a significant increase in QL (136 +/- 15 microliters/min), but CL/CP (0.67 +/- 0.02) failed to decrease significantly at high lymph flows. In group II (n = 15) total protein concentration of airway fluid was compared with that of plasma after smoke inhalation, intravenous alloxan, and increased Pla. The ratio of protein concentration in airway fluid to plasma after SI (0.70 +/- 0.07) was greater than that obtained with increased Pla (0.64 +/- 0.07) but less than that after alloxan (0.85 +/- 0.04). These data indicate that SI in the dog results in a moderate increase in pulmonary vascular permeability that is less severe than that induced by alloxan.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine whether incentive spirometry produces a voluntary activation of diaphragmatic movement in patients with postoperative diaphragmatic dysfunction. Inductance plethysmography was used to measure the tidal volumes of the abdomen and chest in eight women before cholecystectomy and on the first and third postoperative days. In resting patients the relative contribution of the abdominal compartment decreased from 0.520 +/- 0.100 preoperatively to 0.274 +/- 0.265 on postoperative day 1 (p less than 0.01), reflecting the effect of surgery on diaphragmatic function. Inspiratory flow (an index of inspiratory drive) was unaltered by surgery during both resting and incentive spirometry breaths, despite changes in tidal volume. Preoperatively, incentive spirometry increased the tidal volume of the abdominal compartment from 141 +/- 26 ml to 285 +/- 188 ml (p less than 0.005) as a result of increased diaphragmatic movement. This effect was not seen postoperatively; instead, postoperative patients responded to incentive spirometry by increasing the tidal excursion of the chest compartment (158 +/- 37 to 630 +/- 253, p less than 0.005), without any increase in abdominal tidal volume. Thus, incentive spirometry failed to increase diaphragmatic movement in postoperative patients.\r"

We found that after ischemia (20 minutes, global, 37 degrees C), ventricular functional loss--as assessed by measurement of developed pressure (DP), +dp/dt, and -dp/dt with a ventricular balloon--occurred at 10 minutes of reperfusion and that myocardial H2O2 production was maximal by this time. Furthermore, H2O2 production did not occur during ischemia, and inhibition of xanthine oxidase by tungsten feeding or infusing a permeable O2 metabolite scavenger during reperfusion (dimethylthiourea) prevented ventricular functional loss. We conclude that (1) reperfusion injury is in part mediated by toxic oxygen metabolites, (2) H2O2 is the central O2 metabolite responsible for reperfusion injury, and (3) the timing of H2O2 production coincides with the timing of ventricular functional loss.\r"

Peripheral fungal thrombophlebitis, however, has only been recognized recently, is thought rare, and is poorly characterized as to clinical presentation and treatment. We report the cases of eight patients with peripheral Candida thrombophlebitis. Patients were elderly and critically ill. All had received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Skin colonization appeared the source of contamination. Sepsis, shock, and organ failure were frequent. Physical findings of fungal phlebitis may be subtle, and diagnosis is often delayed. Multiple sites are frequently involved. Treatment necessitates radical excision of suspected veins and systemic antifungal chemotherapy. Persistent fungemia suggests inadequate phlebectomy or the existence of further affected veins. Peripheral thrombophlebitis is probably a common source of fungal sepsis and should be considered in all patients with fungemia. Without aggressive surgical intervention, survival is unlikely.\r"

  ".W": "With use of the weakly immunogenic MCA 105 tumor of the C57BL/6 mouse, the antitumor reactivity of lymphoid cells derived from the regional draining lymph nodes (RLN) of tumor-immunized and tumor-bearing mice was examined. Mice were immunized with an inoculation of viable tumor admixed with Corynebacterium parvum. Excision of tumor immunization sites within 4 days abrogated the development of systemic immunity to reject a tumor challenge. However, excision of the immunization site on day 6 did not interfere with the development of systemic antitumor immunity. In subsequent experiments, tumor immunization sites were excised on day 6 in all mice and the RLN either left intact or excised on day 6 or day 14. The development of systemic tumor immunity was severely impaired if RLN were excised on day 6, indicating the pivotal role of the RLN. Excision of the RLN on day 14 had no impact on the development of systemic immunity, thus indicating that the requirement for the RLN was time dependent. In mice bearing progressively growing tumors, lymphoid cells derived from RLN were examined for therapeutic efficacy in adoptive immunotherapy experiments. Although fresh RLN cells harvested 6 and 14 days after tumor inoculation did not demonstrate inherent therapeutic efficacy, after in vitro sensitization with irradiated tumor cells and interleukin-2, these RLN cells acquired significant antitumor activity in adoptive immunotherapy experiments. These data indicate that RLN are essential in the development of tumor immunity and may be used as a source of therapeutic effector cells for adoptive immunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Acidification of the gastric cardia has been shown to increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP). The mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs remains unknown. This study was undertaken to examine the effect and mechanism of action of proximal gastric acidification on LESP in the dog model. In long-term studies, acidification resulted in a significant increase in mean LESP (23.2 cm H2O). Pretreatment with either topical lidocaine or subcutaneous atropine blocked the sphincteric response to acidification. Neither truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty, proximal gastric vagotomy, antral vagotomy and pyloroplasty, nor circumferential gastric myotomy significantly altered the sphincteric response to acid. Pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine or somatostatin also failed to alter the increase in LESP in response to acid. In short-term studies, after gastric transection 5 cm distal to the gastroesophageal junction, acidification of a vagally innervated distal gastric pouch produced a slight decrease in LESP, whereas acidification of the proximal (orad) section of gastric mucosa still resulted in a significant increase in LESP. These studies suggest that the increase in LESP observed with acidification of the gastric cardia is a local mechanism mediated by an intrinsic neural pathway dependent on cholinergic neurotransmission. This phenomenon of local reflex excitation may be another contributing mechanism to the barrier against gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

To ensure that maximum flow has been obtained through the vein graft after valvotomy, a simple perioperative technique has been developed. This consists of infusing normal saline solution into the vein and comparing the distal to proximal (antegrade) flow with the proximal to distal (retrograde) flow under the same conditions. Twelve consecutive in situ vein grafts have been assessed. Antegrade and retrograde flow measurements were similar in four of the grafts but different in eight (40% to 80% reduced retrograde flow). Valvotomy was repeated and subsequent measurements of retrograde flow were similar or greater than the antegrade. The technique described is simple, reproducible, inexpensive, and may prove useful for routine intraoperative evaluation of valvotomy of in situ vein grafts.\r"

There was, however, no difference in the carbachol concentration-response curves or maximum responses to carbachol of tracheal smooth muscle from control and budesonide treated rats. Isometric and isotonic recordings agreed in these respects. Glucocorticoid treatment did not increase the sensitivity of tracheal smooth muscle to the relaxant drugs terbutaline and enprofylline; if anything there was a tendency for terbutaline and enprofylline to be less potent after budesonide treatment. The data suggest that in vivo effects of glucocorticoids on airway responsiveness to bronchodilating and bronchoconstricting drugs are unlikely to be due to a direct effect on bronchial smooth muscle.\r"

Receptor characteristics were determined in tracheal smooth muscle preparations obtained at necropsy from 12 patients and in bronchial tissue obtained at thoracototomy from 21 patients with chronic airflow obstruction. Receptor characteristics were compared with those obtained in airway tissue preparations from 65 control subjects without chronic airflow obstruction. The number of beta adrenoceptors, their binding affinity for the radioligand [125I]-(-)-cyanopindolol, and the tissue binding characteristics of isoprenaline were similar in tissue from patients with chronic airflow obstruction and from control subjects. Isoprenaline induced relaxation of tracheal smooth muscle without precontraction by methacholine showed slightly (though not significantly) less sensitivity to isoprenaline in patients with chronic airflow obstruction than in control subjects (mean (SEM) pD2--the negative logarithm of the concentration producing 50% relaxation--6.32 (0.16) v 6.62 (0.15)). The same pattern of pD2 values was found in segmental bronchial strips without precontraction by methacholine (chronic airflow obstruction 6.55 (0.27), control 7.14 (0.12)). Isoprenaline relaxation in segmental bronchial strips when contracted maximally was significantly less in the patients with airflow obstruction than in the control subjects (pD2 value 5.99 (0.18) v 6.45 (0.07)). These results suggest that beta adrenoceptors in airway smooth muscle of patients with chronic airflow obstruction are not abnormal in number or in binding affinity but that there is less effective coupling between components of the relaxant system distal to the beta adrenoceptor. The possibility that the reduced isoprenaline sensitivity is a consequence of previous bronchodilator treatment cannot be excluded.\r"

To assess whether this relation is likely to represent a direct causal association a randomised double blind crossover trial of slow sodium (80 mmol/day) was compared with placebo in 36 subjects having a low sodium diet. The dose of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) was 1.51 doubling doses lower when the men were taking sodium than when they were taking placebo (p less than 0.05). On the basis of PD10 values, the difference in men was 1.66 doubling doses of histamine (p less than 0.05). There was no corresponding effect in women. Regressing PD10 against urinary excretion of electrolytes with data from the two occasions during the trial and the measurements made before the trial showed a significant association with sodium excretion after allowance had been made for any effect associated with potassium or creatinine excretion, the latter being a marker of the completeness of the urine collection. Again there was no corresponding effect among women. These findings are compatible with the differences in regional mortality data for England and Wales, which show a relation between asthma mortality and regional per person purchases of table salt for men but not for women.\r"

  ".W": "The management of carcinoma of the oesophagus poses formidable logistic problems in countries such as Transkei where the condition is common and resources are limited. Most patients present late, often with complications, and are reluctant to undergo major surgery. Two hundred and fifty consecutive patients who presented over nine months in Transkei were studied. The incidence increased with age until 70 years and the disease occurred equally in men and women. The neoplasm was predominantly squamous cell (243 patients, 97%) and was found most often in the middle third of the oesophagus (118, 47%). On admission only eight of the 250 patients could take a semi-solid diet and only 21 a fluid diet. The policy where feasible was to introduce a Proctor Livingstone tube endoscopically through the dilated oesophageal stricture by a pulsion technique under light general anaesthesia. When abdominal perforation of the oesophagus seemed likely, retrograde intubation via a gastrotomy was performed. Sixty patients were not intubated, because the stricture was too proximal (47) or could not be dilated adequately (6), the lesion was suitable for resection (6), or the patient refused (1). Fifty one (27%) patients died in hospital, 29 deaths being due to oesophageal perforation (including six of the 10 who were intubated retrogradely). The mean hospital stay was 4.7 days. On discharge 64% of the intubated patients were able to take semi-solid food and a further 6% a fluid diet. Palliation by intubation was performed rapidly and the tube was well tolerated by patients. The overall mortality was high, but this can be reduced by experience. Intubation is an acceptable, cost effective solution where large numbers of patients present with advanced oesophageal carcinoma in circumstances where resources are severely limited.\r"

Four patients had undergone three or more endobronchial laser treatments before being referred. Under general anaesthesia diathermy was used to resect obstructing tumour before the insertion of the gold grains into the tumour and the compressed endobronchial wall. Four patients died within one month. The remaining 11 patients were symptomatically and objectively improved when assessed at one month. Both collapsed lungs and three out of six collapsed lobes had re-expanded. Fourteen of the 15 patients died within 13 months (median survival 2.5 months); one patient with recurrent symptoms after 10 months underwent a further implantation and is alive after two years.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of a constant increase in functional residual capacity on apnoea characteristics was studied in patients with the sleep apnoea syndrome. Pulmonary inflation was achieved by applying a continuous negative extrathoracic pressure into a Poncho type respirator. Nine patients slept in the Poncho for two consecutive nights, negative extrathoracic pressure being applied during the second night. There was no difference in the total sleep time, its composition within the different sleep stages, the apnoea and apnoea-hypopnoea indices, or the sleep time spent in apnoea between the two nights. The mean (SD) apnoea duration increased with negative extrathoracic pressure from 25.3 (2) to 30.5 (3) seconds (p = 0.003) and time spent in obstructive apnoea (percentage of apnoea time) from 56 (13) to 75 (8) (p = 0.02). The mixed apnoea time (%) decreased from 37 (7) to 21 (7) (p = 0.02). Despite the increase in apnoea duration, less time was spent below each oxygen saturation value during negative extrathoracic pressure. The results were similar for apnoeic episodes during non-REM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep, whereas no significant modifications were seen during REM sleep. It is concluded that the composition of apnoea time and resulting oxygen desaturation are influenced by lung volume.\r"

This study looks at the influence of the type of disease presentation and the time since onset of symptoms on lavage fluid lymphocyte profiles in 99 patients studied at the time of their initial diagnosis. Patients who had an acute inflammatory onset of disease with erythema nodosum (n = 32) or acute uveitis (n = 17) almost invariably had high T lymphocyte helper:suppressor (TH:TS) ratios (mean 10.1, 95% confidence interval 7.7-12.5) and had a higher proportion of T lymphocytes in cells obtained at lavage (40%, 35-46%) than patients with a pulmonary presentation (n = 38) (TH:TS 2.9, 0.2-5.7; T lymphocytes 21%, 15-27%) or those studied after resolution of erythema nodosum (n = 12). The patients with recent erythema nodosum had the highest TH:TS ratios of any group (10.4, 8.1-12.7). Thus lavage T lymphocyte percentage and TH:TS are highest in patients with sarcoidosis studied soon after an acute onset with an inflammatory condition such as erythema nodosum or uveitis. Patients with an acute onset of sarcoidosis have a better prognosis than those with a more insidious presentation. The major influence of type of disease presentation and, in the case of patients with erythema nodosum, of time since onset of symptoms may in part explain why different centres have reported such diverse results regarding the value of bronchoalveolar lavage in predicting outcome in sarcoidosis. Studies where the case mix of patients includes a high proportion of patients with acute onset will not find a high TH:TS ratio or increased numbers or proportions of lavage lymphocytes to be indicators of a poor prognosis.\r"

The patients had normal serum concentrations of hyaluronan and of the procollagen peptide, and albumin concentrations in lavage fluid similar to those of the control subjects. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in lavage fluid were increased on average 10 and two fold respectively in the patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and both correlated with the amount of hyaluronan recovered (p less than 0.05). An inverse correlation was seen between the transfer factor for carbon monoxide and hyaluronan concentrations in lavage fluid in the patients (p less than 0.05). Deterioration in lung function and radiographic progression were seen over six months in 12 of the patients. These patients had higher lavage fluid concentrations of hyaluronan and type III procollagen peptide than the patients whose disease was stable (p less than 0.01). Increased synthesis of hyaluronan and type III procollagen peptide in lung parenchyma may reflect activation or proliferation (or both) of pulmonary fibroblasts in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and seems to be linked to the severity and activity of the lung disease.\r"

In addition, 13 patients with bird fancier's lung (11 of the original group) were tested at least one year after avoiding exposure to the causal antigen. Five antigens (candidine, staphylococcal toxoid, tuberculin purified protein derivative, trichophyton, and streptokinase-streptodornase) were injected intradermally (0.1 ml) and the mean weal diameter was measured at 48 hours. The mean weal size was significantly less in the subjects with bird fancier's lung at the time of diagnosis than in the control group (2.23 v 5.66 mm) but did not differ significantly from that of the subjects with sarcoidosis (2.80 mm) or from that of the bird fanciers with no exposure to the causal antigen for one year (2.75 mm).

The outcome has been reviewed for 46 patients (23 male, 23 female) aged 70 years or more (mean 74 years) undergoing oesophageal resection during a period of seven years; 16 patients were 75 years or over. All resections were performed with the EEA stapler, except for one cervical anastomosis that was stitched by hand. In 42 patients resection was for malignancy. Six patients died within 30 days of operation or during the initial hospital stay, giving an operative mortality of 13%. Only one of the 16 patients aged 75 years or more died. Cardiopulmonary complications accounted for most of the operative deaths. Patients were scored retrospectively by a multifactual risk factor. Patients who left hospital had a mean preoperative score of 3.66, compared with 15.2 for those who died. Use of such a score may help to improve selection for surgery in this age group. It is concluded that oesophagogastrectomy may be performed in selected patients over the age of 70 years with acceptable mortality, morbidity, and length of hospital stay.\r"

Subjects underwent two histamine challenge tests (1 and 2) on the same day, the second one being given 45-60 minutes after the first, once the FEV1 after test 1 had returned spontaneously to within 90% of baseline. A further \"control\" histamine challenge test was carried out on a different day at the same time (+/- 2 hours) as test 1. Bronchial responsiveness was recorded as the cumulative dose (microgram) of histamine provoking a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20), and the ratio PD20 test 2:PD20 test 1 was used to assess refractoriness. The median value of this ratio (2.20) was significantly greater than 1 (p = 0.003), indicating refractoriness at the time of test 2. By contrast the median ratio PD20 control:PD20 test 1 of 1.03 was not significantly different from 1. Refractoriness could not be accounted for by failure to regain the initial baseline FEV1, though such failure may have exaggerated the effect. An increase in PD20 with the second test was observed uniformly in subjects with moderate or high initial PD20 values but not in those with low values. This suggests that there may be a PD20 threshold of the order 25-100 micrograms for refractoriness to occur. Refractoriness could exert an important confounding effect in investigations in which repeated histamine tests are carried out at short intervals.\r"

  ".W": "The value of non-invasive procedures for predicting pulmonary arterial pressure was investigated in 370 patients with chronic obstructive lung diseases and in 73 with fibrosing alveolitis in a combined study at nine centres in six European countries. Measurements included forced expiratory volume in one second, arterial blood gas tensions, standard electrocardiogram, radiographic dimensions of pulmonary artery, right ventricle dimensions by M mode echocardiography, and myocardial scintigraphy with thallium-201; and certain clinical signs were also used. No single variable was correlated closely enough to allow accurate prediction of pulmonary arterial pressure. Four methods were used to incorporate several variables into mathematical functions for predicting pulmonary arterial pressure. In patients with chronic obstructive lung disease multiple stepwise regression explained 49% of the variance in pulmonary arterial pressure but was not useful for prediction. Discriminant analysis allowed patients to be allocated to bands of pulmonary arterial pressure, as did two non-parametric procedures, in which decision trees were established using either the Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff statistic or Fisher's exact test. Patients with a pulmonary arterial pressure of 30 mm Hg or more were identified with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 91%. The non-parametric tests gave better results than discriminant function. A further 54 patients were studied to validate the functions. Of these, 90% with a pulmonary arterial pressure above 20 mm Hg were correctly identified, and 80% of those with a pulmonary arterial pressure above 29 mm Hg. Similar results were obtained in subjects with fibrosing alveolitis. These mathematical functions allow the use of combinations of non-invasive procedures to select from populations at risk of pulmonary hypertension those in whom direct measurement is required. The mathematical functions are capable of further development by incorporation of variables from newer non-invasive procedures.\r"

Interviews and self complete questionnaires were used to assess patients' management of a hypothetical slow onset and rapid onset attack of asthma, attitudes to asthma, family support, psychiatric morbidity, recent asthma morbidity, and knowledge of drug treatment. The patients with the highest morbidity from asthma delayed longest before taking appropriate action in the hypothetical acute attack. One in four patients expressed strong feelings of stigma and pessimism about being asthmatic, but attitudes were only weakly associated with behaviour. Other factors showed no significant relation to self care. The results suggest that there is no single important factor or group of factors governing patients' management of acute asthma. Health education might therefore prove more effective if it paid less attention to the possible cause or causes of poor self care and instead offered pragmatic advice on changing behaviour.\r"

By analysis of variance, no differences were observed in the concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or apoproteins A1 and B. Patients with lacunar infarction, however, had higher concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol than patients with cortical stroke. This HDL-cholesterol difference was due primarily to a strikingly low HDL-cholesterol content in white patients with cortical stroke. These data suggest that previously demonstrated differences in HDL-cholesterol concentrations between patients with ischemic stroke and control subjects without stroke may apply to patients with cortical but not lacunar infarction. Separation of cerebral infarction into subtypes based on mechanism may help clarify lipid-related risk factors in cerebrovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 40 patients with stroke of potential cardioembolic origin by cardiac ultrafast computed tomography and two-dimensional echocardiography. Cardiac ultrafast computed tomography was more sensitive (positive in eight of 14 instances) than two-dimensional echocardiography (positive in two of 14 instances) for the detection of intracardiac thrombus, which was found in 13 patients. Mitral anular calcification was diagnosed more often by two-dimensional echocardiography (four of five instances) than by cardiac ultrafast computed tomography (one of five instances); this implies a high incidence of false-positives for the former. Cardiac ultrafast computed tomography showed that one half of the patients (21 of 40) had coronary artery calcification, indicating a high incidence of coronary atheroma in this patient population. Future studies comparing brain and cardiac pathology with the findings of cardiac ultrafast computed tomography and patient prognosis are needed to define the significance and utility of this technique in patients with stroke.\r"

Activities of both enzymes were similar (p greater than 0.05) in 6- (n = 5) and 12- (n = 5) month-old rats. Mean +/- SEM choline acetyltransferase activities in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum of 6-month-old controls were 75 +/- 5, 123 +/- 9, 415 +/- 9, and 50 +/- 4 nmol acetylcholine/hr/mg protein, respectively, and were 20-30% lower (p less than 0.05) in all brain regions except the cerebellum in 24-month-old controls. Choline acetyltransferase activity was unaffected by ischemia in 6- and 12-month-old rats but was reduced by 30-60% in 24-month-old rats. Mean +/- SEM glutamic acid decarboxylase activities in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum of 6-month-old controls were 98 +/- 8, 86 +/- 7, 144 +/- 13, and 125 +/- 9 nmol gamma-aminobutyric acid/hr/mg protein, respectively, and 25-35% lower in all regions of 24-month-old controls. After 30 minutes of ischemia and 5 days of recovery, glutamic acid decarboxylase activities were reduced (p less than 0.05) in all brain regions and age groups. However, its activity was decreased (p less than 0.05 compared with age-matched controls) by 55% in the cortex and 79% in the hippocampus of 24-month-old rats compared with 30% and 45% in younger rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cortical infarction was produced by ligation of the middle cerebral artery and the ipsilateral common carotid artery combined with temporary occlusion of the contralateral common carotid artery for 1 hour. Water content and sodium, potassium, and calcium concentrations were measured until Day 14 after the ischemic insult. Significant edema formation was observed; it peaked on Day 3 (p less than 0.001) and then declined. The tissue sodium concentration changed in a manner similar to that of water content, but the tissue potassium concentration changed in an opposite fashion. Massive accumulation of calcium was detected as early as Day 1 after ischemia (almost four times the normal level). The increased calcium concentration was sustained even up to Day 14. Motor performance examinations performed on Day 3, including inclined plane, balance beam, and prehensile tests, demonstrated significantly reduced (p less than 0.001) motor ability that did recover even by Day 7. Passive avoidance learning was carried out on Day 2, followed by a memory retention test on Day 3. Significant memory dysfunction was observed in ischemic compared with sham-operated rats (p less than 0.001). A high correlation coefficient (r = 0.91, p less than 0.01, n = 13) was obtained between water content and calcium concentration on Day 3. Both the total motor score and the degree of disturbance of the passive avoidance reaction also correlated well with water content.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperglycemia has been reported to worsen the tolerance of the brain to ischemia, and it has therefore been recommended that patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures not receive glucose-containing solutions. However, whereas most animal studies have used global ischemia models, most neurosurgical procedures are associated with risks of focal rather than global ischemia. We therefore studied the effects of glucose administration in an animal model of focal cerebral ischemia. We anesthetized 20 cats with halothane (0.85% end tidal in oxygen), and a focal cerebral ischemic lesion was produced by clip ligation of the left middle cerebral artery using a transorbital approach. Hyperglycemia (10 cats, mean +/- SEM plasma glucose concentration 561 +/- 36 mg/dl) was established before ligation by infusion of 50% glucose in 0.45% saline; the control group (10 cats, mean +/- SEM plasma glucose concentration 209 +/- 28 mg/dl) received 0.45% saline only. Total fluid administered, mean arterial blood pressure, body temperature, and arterial blood gas values did not differ between the two groups 0, 2, and 6 hours after ligation. The cats were killed 6 hours after ligation, and the area of severe ischemic neuronal damage was determined by microscopic examination of a coronal section at the level of the optic chiasm. The mean +/- SEM area of left cortical severe ischemic neuronal damage was 12 +/- 2% of the left cortex in the hyperglycemic group compared with 28 +/- 5% in the control group (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Leukotriene (LT) C4, LTD4, and LTE4 were purified from incubated basilar artery, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, median eminence, and blood clot from around the basilar artery using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and the amount of each LT was quantified separately by bioassay with guinea pig ileum. The biosynthetic capacity for total LTs was approximately three times higher in the hypothalamus and median eminence than in the basilar artery and medulla oblongata in the eight normal dogs. In the dogs with subarachnoid hemorrhage, the biosynthetic capacity was increased significantly both before and 2 hours after the second injection of blood on Day 2 and was normal on Day 7 in the basilar artery and medulla oblongata, whereas the biosynthetic capacity was decreased significantly 2 hours after the first and second injections of blood and was increased significantly on Day 7 in the hypothalamus and median eminence. In blood clot the biosynthetic capacity was increased continuously after the first injection of blood. Thus, the biosynthetic capacity for total LTs showed a time- and tissue-specific change after subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

In each group, 17 dogs were subjected to 6 hours of internal carotid and middle cerebral artery occlusion, and five dogs received sham operations. Isovolemic hemodilution by phlebotomy and Ringer's lactate infusion was performed 30 minutes after arterial occlusion and resulted in an average hematocrit of 32-33%. Hemodilution significantly reduced viscosity, fibrinogen and total protein concentrations, and plasma oncotic pressure. Systemic arterial blood pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure decreased slightly with hemodilution, but central venous pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure did not change significantly. There was a similar decrease in cardiac index in both hemodiluted and control dogs, which may have been due to the effects of barbiturate anesthesia. Intracranial pressure increased significantly with time in all dogs subjected to arterial occlusion, but this increase was significantly more severe in the hemodiluted dogs. Specific gravity, measured just after the dogs were killed, 6 hours after hemodilution, was significantly lower in the white matter and basal ganglia of the left (ischemic) hemisphere in hemodiluted dogs than in controls. Regional cerebral blood flow decreased significantly in the left hemisphere after arterial occlusion. This decrease was almost completely reversed by hemodilution except in the basal ganglia, where the increase in edema caused by hemodilution was the greatest.\r"

Cerebral ischemia may eliminate the prostanoid vasodilator system from the cerebral circulation. Norepinephrine (10(-4) M) decreased pial arteriolar diameters similarly in all three groups (27%, 28%, and 21%, respectively), but only the sham-operated group exhibited pial arteriolar dilation in response to hypotension (28% at 33 mm Hg). Two-three and 24 hours after cerebral ischemia, hypotension decreased pial arteriolar diameters (21% and 17%, respectively). In sham-operated piglets, norepinephrine and hypotension increased cortical periarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid prostanoid concentrations. However, neither norepinephrine nor hypotension altered cerebral prostanoid production 2-3 or 24 hours after cerebral ischemia. Therefore, we conclude that after cerebral ischemia, autoregulatory pial arteriolar dilation in response to hypotension is absent, while vasoconstriction in response to norepinephrine is intact.\r"

We therefore used urine lysozyme assays to assess renal response to percutaneous nephrostomy and stone removal in 42 patients. Eight patients had striking increases (4.2-21.1 [mean 7.58] micrograms/mg creatinine) immediately after nephrostomy puncture in urine obtained directly from the punctured kidney. Lysozyme declined sharply thereafter and was within normal limits in all cases by postoperative day 3. This increase appeared to result from bleeding into the urine from the tract. Five other patients had lysozymuria on admission, only 1 of whom had a sharp increase after nephrostomy puncture. In the remaining patients, the lysozyme levels remained within normal limits throughout the hospital course. These data are further evidence of the absence of significant deleterious effects of nephrostomy puncture on the kidney.\r"

Angioscopy was successful before angioplasty in nine and after angioplasty in 10 of 11 coronary segments. Before angioplasty, the stenotic segments were composed of yellowish or whitish atheromatous plaques with smooth surfaces or spiral folds in patients with stable angina pectoris. In one patient with unstable angina pectoris, the stenotic segment was scalloped angiographically and showed an irregular and whitish plaque angioscopically. After angioplasty, endothelial exfoliation with scattered thrombi (10 segments), bellows-like folds (two), longitudinal cleft (one), plaque rupture (two), and intimal dissection (two) could be identified angioscopically. These changes, with the exception of dissection, could not be identified angiographically. In one patient who underwent thermal argon laser angioplasty, the dilated segment appeared brownish, which indicated carbonization. In one patient with acute myocardial infarction, the occlusive thrombi were vaporized by thermal laser angioplasty. The results demonstrate the clinical feasibility of percutaneous angioscopy for pathologic documentation of coronary luminal changes before and after angioplasty.\r"

To evaluate the risks and benefits of heparin after coronary angioplasty, 416 patients (469 vessel sites) with successful coronary angioplasty without large dissection were randomized to heparin (titrated to partial thromboplastin time 1.5 to 2.5 times normal) or dextrose administered for 18 to 24 hours. Patients also had received heparin during angioplasty (usually 10,000 to 15,000 units), and they received aspirin for a period of 6 months.

  ".W": "Routine assessment of the severity of a coronary artery lesion with coronary cineangiography is limited by its variability and poor correlation with blood flow and postmortem findings. In this investigation, we compared the usefulness of the final coronary artery translesional pressure gradient and the final angiographic coronary percent stenosis to assess immediate percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) success. To accomplish this, pressure gradients and percent stenoses were compared to stress thallium-201 regional myocardial perfusion before and after 56 uncomplicated PTCAs in 51 patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease. There were 39 men and 12 women; their mean age was 59 +/- 12 years. No patient had evidence of myocardial infarction. A new quantitative method to assess regional myocardial perfusion was used. Patients exercised for 433 +/- 130 seconds before PTCA and for 545 +/- 126 seconds after PTCA (p less than 0.001). Group coronary stenosis and translesional pressure gradient decreased from 77 +/- 11% and 48 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively, before PTCA, to 25 +/- 11% and 9 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively, after PTCA (p less than 0.001). Regional myocardial perfusion in the segment of the diseased (dilated) coronary artery increased after PTCA from 77 +/- 17% to 94 +/- 9% (p less than 0.001). Although a significant relationship was noted between regional myocardial perfusion and percent stenosis and translesional pressure gradient, a large individual scatter was present (r values lower than 0.55). We conclude that the final translesional pressure gradient during PTCA is not a better measure of immediate PTCA success than the angiographic percent stenosis.\r"

Propranolol-pretreated dogs (N = 9) displayed a significantly lower left ventricular peak-positive rise in ventricular pressure (dP/dt), heart rate, and rate-pressure product throughout the experiment compared with the control group (N = 15). Subendocardial percent segment shortening as measured by sonomicrometry recovered to 65.4 +/- 7.2% of the preocclusion level after pretreatment with propranolol, whereas the control group recovered to only 11.1% +/- 10.2% after 3 hours of reperfusion. To ascertain the beneficial role of a lower heart rate on the recovery of regional contractile function, a third group of dogs (N = 6) was pretreated with propranolol, but heart rate was maintained at control levels by atrial pacing. The beneficial effects of pretreatment with propranolol were abolished in this group. There were no differences between groups in myocardial perfusion in the normal region as measured by the radioactive microsphere technique. However, in postischemic, reperfused myocardium, there was a significantly higher blood flow to subepicardium, mid-myocardium, and subendocardium after reperfusion in the propranolol-pretreated, unpaced group. Thus long-term oral pretreatment with propranolol enhances the contractile recovery of postischemic, reperfused myocardium. This protective effect of beta-adrenergic blockade is primarily related to the reduction in heart rate and enhanced perfusion in the postischemic region.\r"

Cats were rendered ischemic by left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation for 1 1/2 hours followed by reperfusion for 4 1/2 hours. BM-13505 or its vehicle (i.e., Na2CO3) was administered intravenously 30 minutes before reperfusion at a rate of 1 mg/kg followed by 1 mg/kg/hr. BM-13505 significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced the area of ischemic tissue as a percent of total left ventricular mass and total area at risk, without altering basic hemodynamics (i.e., arterial blood pressure, heart rate, or their product) and thereby not influencing myocardial oxygen demand.

Nineteen of the patients had had angina before the infarction (group A), whereas the infarction was unheralded in the remaining 17 (group B). Thirty-two vessels (88%) were patent at follow-up angiography performed after 3 to 4 weeks, and the residual stenosis was 87% +/- 14% in group A and 47% +/- 25% in group B (p less than 0.001). Coronary spasm was provoked by ergonovine maleate in four of 12 patients in group A (33%) and in three patients in group B (18%). Coronary revascularization was undertaken in nine patients in group A and three in group B. These results indicate that patients with angina preceding acute myocardial infarction are more likely to have significant stenosis even at the late follow-up stage and to have a more urgent need for subsequent coronary revascularization. It also seems apparent that thromboembolism in most patients and coronary spasm in a few patients without significant coronary narrowing play significant causal roles in the onset of acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".U": "89190346\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported that regional wall motion abnormalities in a canine model of acute myocardial infarction may show substantial improvement in the first 6 weeks after infarction. To determine whether the mechanism of this improvement in function is the result of scar contraction within the infarct, we studied the relationship between changes in regional wall motion defined by cross-sectional echocardiography and the regional concentration of radioactive microspheres injected immediately before coronary occlusion and sampled 6 weeks after occlusion. Eight dogs underwent serial echocardiographic and microsphere blood flow measurements immediately before and 30 minutes, 48 hours, 1 week, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks after ligation of the left anterior descending or the left circumflex coronary artery. Wall motion and blood flow were measured in the short-axis section of the left ventricle at the level of the midpapillary muscle in each 10-degree radial segment around the circumference of the ventricle. Infarct histology was assessed at 6 weeks by means of the same radial coordinate system. Control data were collected in a similar manner from four dogs that underwent sham operations and had no histologic evidence of infarction. In all of the animals with infarcts, but not in the sham animals, the calculated preocclusion endocardial and epicardial blood flow values in the histologic infarct zone (252 +/- 44 and 168 +/- 17 ml/min/100 gm, respectively, mean +/- SEM) were significantly higher than those in the normal opposite wall (endocardial: 106 +/- 3 ml/min/100 gm, p less than 0.01); epicardial: 108 +/- 3 ml/min/100 gm, p less than 0.01. The location and circumferential extent of myocardium showing this elevation of preocclusion blood flow correlated well (r = 0.93, p less than 0.001) with the location and circumferential extent of the histologic infarct. The amount of wall motion abnormality, measured from the \"correlation plot area,\" decreased significantly from its maximum value of 39 +/- 3 degrees at 48 hours after coronary occlusion to 3 +/- 1 degrees (p less than 0.001) at 6 weeks after occlusion. The ratio of the preocclusion transmural blood flow in the infarct zone to that in the noninfarct zone, a measure of the condensation of the microspheres injected before coronary occlusion, and therefore of the degree of scar contraction at 6 weeks, correlated well (r = 0.83, p less than 0.01) with the recovery of wall motion 6 weeks after infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The nature and cause of the striking regional dilatation of the microvasculature of the subendocardial myocardium seen in some patients with ischemic heart disease are unknown. To examine this question, we reviewed nine patients in whom regions of the left ventricular free wall had marked prominence of subendocardial vasculature on postmortem arteriography. All hearts had severe diffuse atherosclerosis of major epicardial coronary arteries. Histologic findings, including serial transmural sections, showed extreme dilatation of arterioles, capillaries, and venules of the subendocardial third of the myocardium. In this same region myocytes showed atrophy, vacuolization (a marker of chronic ischemia), and small foci of necrosis and fibrosis. The generalized small-vessel dilatation with adjacent ischemic myocytes makes it improbable that the vascular changes are caused by collateral flow. Previous anatomic studies have shown artery-vein arrangements in the myocardium providing for countercurrent regulation of regional blood flow. This mechanism, which produces vascular enlargement on the basis of metabolic need, may explain the regional variceal transformation of the subendocardial microvasculature seen with chronic ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibition of the enzyme that synthesizes thromboxanes may protect against the development of ventricular fibrillation (VF) during acute myocardial ischemia. This study was carried out to test this hypothesis with a new thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, and to extend the studies to alternative animal models of myocardial infarction. In a series of acute experiments, 19 cats were pretreated with 10 mg/kg of U-63557A (a dose that produced greater than 75% reduction in thromboxane B2 [TxB2] levels) or saline before abrupt left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Seven of the nine control animals suffered spontaneous VF associated with a 77% fall in VF threshold compared with the treated animals, of which 2 of 10 had spontaneous VF and in which VF threshold fell by only 45% (p less than 0.025). Despite a similar extent of TxB2 inhibition in another set of nine animals, U-63557A failed to protect against a fall in VF threshold during coronary reperfusion. Finally, chronic changes in VF threshold and inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia by programmed stimulation were assessed in a group of eight animals. The lowering of VF threshold and inducibility of ventricular tachycardia seen in the control state were not influenced by treatment with U-63557A. Thus protection against infarct-related VF by TxB2 inhibition is a property shared by more than one pharmacologic agent. Arrhythmias generated by reperfusion or induced in a more chronic setting may not be thromboxane-dependent. These results have important implications for the planning of studies designed to assess the antiarrhythmic potential of drugs that inhibit thromboxane synthesis.\r"

Standard microelectrode techniques were used in canine Purkinje fibers. With Ni++ in segment A, there was a dispersion in APD measured at both 50% (APD50) and 95% (APD95) of repolarization. After selective addition of K+ to segment B, APD50 dispersion remained constant while APD95 dispersion increased, which indicated a change in the slope of repolarization, a factor with possible arrhythmogenic potential. In addition, a characteristic transitional action potential was seen adjacent to the partition. This had a timely and normally sloping early repolarization followed by a much more gradually sloping shelf. Premature action potentials arising during this shelf had diminished upstrokes. Results of these experiments may be useful in evaluating APD dispersion in relation to arrhythmias.\r"

To assess the use of phase analysis in LAFB, left ventricular phase and amplitude maps were evaluated in the 70-degree left anterior oblique projection in eight control patients and 13 patients with LAFB who met the ECG criteria of Warner et al. The left ventricular region was divided into anterior (A) and inferior (I) segments. Contraction patterns were assessed by examination of the sequence of phase angles (phi), relative contraction time of the anterior versus inferior segments was assessed from the difference between segment mean phase angles, delta phi A-I, determined from the phase histogram, and duration of contraction was assessed by histogram width. Relative stroke volume was assessed on the amplitude image. Eight control subjects had normal amplitude, contraction of the anterior before inferior segment, narrow histogram width, and a normal ECG. Among the 13 patients with ECG LAFB, seven were concordant, with phase analysis demonstrating anterior contraction delay. Two of seven patients had narrow histograms and normal amplitude, which were compatible with isolated anterior conduction delay, and five of seven patients had broad histograms and reduced anterior amplitude, compatible with anterior infarction. Phase analysis was discordant with ECG LAFB diagnosis in six patients. All showed contraction of anterior segments before inferior segments as in normal subjects. Four had broad histograms and reduced inferior amplitude, compatible with prior inferior infarction without LAFB, and two had normal phase and amplitude maps. Phase patterns appear characteristic of LAFB with or without associated infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At baseline, isovolumic relaxation time was prolonged compared with that in 18 age-matched normal subjects (95 +/- 13 msec versus 74 +/- 12 msec, p less than 0.001), but decreased to 80 +/- 14 msec (p less than 0.001) after treatment. The ratio between early and atrial-induced transmitral velocities (E/A-ratio) at baseline was lower in patients than in normal subjects (1.1 +/- 0.2 versus 1.4 +/- 0.3, p = 0.01), as was the filling fraction of the first third of diastole (43% +/- 5% versus 50% +/- 4%, p less than 0.001). Verapamil treatment increased the E/A-ratio to 1.3 +/- 0.4 (p less than 0.001) and filling fraction to 45% +/- 4% (p = 0.055) because of increased early filling. No change in systolic performance or heart rate was observed. Thus, coronary artery disease was associated with retarded relaxation and impairment of early filling. However, verapamil treatment enhanced relaxation and induced a filling shift toward early diastole, which indicated improved diastolic performance. The changes probably reflected reduced myocardial ischemia.\r"

Inflammatory criteria were present in 23% of the population studied with 13% having overt myocarditis according to the Dallas criteria. The addition of prednisone to conventional therapy did not improve survival in a homogeneous population with new-onset dilated cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, the diagnosis of myocarditis by endomyocardial biopsy did not influence 2-year survival once dilated cardiomyopathy had developed. Biopsy-documented myocarditis resolved in all patients, according to results of 3-month follow-up endomyocardial biopsies, regardless of treatment group. There was a trend for patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 20% to show reduced survival at 2 years compared to the group with a higher ejection fraction (p = 0.07). Right ventricular dysfunction determined at catheterization was present in 20 of 52 patients and was the most significant predictor of survival. Patients with preserved right ventricular function had a 95% 24-month survival rate compared to 47% for patients with right ventricular diastolic dysfunction (right ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than or equal to 11 mm Hg) (p = 0.005).\r"

We used krypton 81m (81mKr) and technetium 99m (99mTc) to assess lung ventilation and perfusion at rest and during exercise. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained with a balloon floatation thermodilution catheter. At rest, the upper lung zones of patients with CHF received significantly higher proportions of the blood flow compared with previously published data in normal volunteers. During exercise, however, the fractional perfusion to apices did not change, which suggests that apical flow redistribution is already maximized at rest. Measured pulmonary capillary wedge pressure failed to correlate with the upper zone or the ratio of upper-to-lower zone perfusion counts. Our findings suggest that upper zone flow redistribution may be associated with high, normal, or low capillary wedge pressure and therefore does not correlate with the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with chronic CHF.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary reperfusion in myocardial infarction improves infarct zone motion, but its effect on the global ejection fraction has been less consistent. The directional movement of the ejection fraction is determined by the opposing influences of improved infarct zone motion and diminishing hyperkinesia in the noninfarct zone. Noninfarct zone hyperkinesia has been attributed to catecholamine stimulation, the Frank-Starling mechanism or intraventricular interactions that unload noninfarcted segments. To investigate the influence of catecholamine stimulation, 9 men presenting with a first myocardial infarction (mean age 53 +/- 13 years) were studied. Coronary reperfusion was accomplished less than 4 hours after the onset of myocardial infarction. Radionuclide ventriculography was then performed before and immediately after the intravenous administration of 15 mg of metoprolol. End-diastolic volume did not change, but end-systolic volume increased 28% after metoprolol (p = 0.041). The ejection fraction decreased from 55 +/- 13% before metoprolol to 45 +/- 14% after its administration (p = 0.002). There was no effect of intravenous metoprolol on infarct zone motion, whereas motion in the noninfarcted segment decreased (p = 0.002). The patients underwent repeat ventriculography after receiving metoprolol, 100 mg orally twice a day for 9 days. Infarct zone motion improved (p less than 0.002) and the ejection fraction increased to 55 +/- 12% (p less than 0.02). Normal zone motion did not change. Thus, compensatory hyperkinesia is at least in part caused by catecholamine stimulation. Conclusions regarding the effects of reperfusion on global ventricular performance can be influenced by the timing of ejection fraction determinations relative to metoprolol therapy.\r"

Thirty-three patients had new onset of fascicular block considered to be a consequence of AMI. Multivariate analysis using 16 clinical variables revealed that the number of asynergic segments, serum potassium level and pericardial rub were significant factors related to the occurrence of fascicular block. Among the 33 patients with fascicular block, 18 had persistent (group 1) and 15 had transient (group 2) fascicular blocks. When the 2 groups with fascicular block were compared, group 1 had significantly more asynergic segments than group 2 (4.7 +/- 1.2 vs 3.7 +/- 1.6, respectively), whereas pericardial rubs were observed significantly more in group 2 (67%) than in group 1 (28%). Therefore, the inflammatory process of AMI was 1 of the mechanisms related to the occurrence of a transient fascicular block and a more extensive myocardial necrosis was associated with a persistent fascicular block.\r"

  ".W": "A growing body of evidence suggests that survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is considerably worse among blacks than whites. The severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), as measured by the number of diseased vessels and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction, is the major determinant of survival after AMI. To determine whether or not the severity of CAD could explain the poor prognosis in a cohort of blacks followed at this institution, cardiac catheterization was performed in a consecutive series of 51 patients less than 70 years of age. All patients were studied within 2 weeks after AMI. The mean age of the patients was 56 +/- 8 (mean +/- standard deviation) and 71% were men. A greater than or equal to 50 narrowing in 0, 1, 2 or 3 coronary arteries was noted in 5, 24, 40 and 31%, respectively. Left main stenosis was present in 3 patients (6%) and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. In a subgroup of 20 patients echocardiographic estimates of left ventricular mass/height yielded a mean of 196 g/m, and left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiogram was present in 74%. These data indicate that among blacks with AMI in this series CAD was only modestly more severe than expected and suggest that other factors most likely explain the high mortality in blacks after hospital discharge.\r"

Thrombolytic therapy was not attempted during the study. Patients were dichotomized according to their peak CK levels, determined from a cluster analysis of peak CK distribution among the population of patients who died within 3 years after hospital discharge. The 139 patients with low peak CK (less than or equal to 650 IU/liter) (group 1) were compared to the 584 patients with high peak CK (greater than 650 IU/liter) (group 2). Patients in group 1 were older and had a higher incidence of previous AMI, angina pectoris before AMI and non-Q-wave AMI. Despite a lower incidence of in-hospital complications and a nonsignificantly lower hospital mortality rate (4 vs 9%) the group 1 three-year posthospital mortality rate was higher (26 vs 17%; p less than 0.02), especially in the subgroup of patients with a Q-wave infarct (mortality 31% in group 1 vs 16% in group 2; p less than 0.001). Among the 491 patients who had a first Q-wave AMI, 55 had a peak CK less than or equal to 650 IU/liter. Compared to the 436 patients with a higher peak CK, these 55 patients had a higher incidence of early postinfarction angina (31 vs 14%; p less than 0.01), a similar hospital mortality (4 vs 7%) but a higher 3-year posthospital mortality (23 vs 12%; p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The population consisted of 344 consecutive survivors of acute myocardial infarction admitted to the hospital with chest pain and ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram. Three groups constituted the study population: 168 control patients treated conservatively or in whom fibrinolysis was unsuccessful, 73 patients successfully reperfused with intravenous streptokinase and 103 patients with both successful fibrinolysis and successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the artery responsible for the infarct.

Similarly, exercise-induced ST-segment depression on the predischarge exercise treadmill test was less frequent with PTCA (p less than 0.05).

At rest, nisoldipine decreased systemic resistance from 18.9 +/- 1.0 to 15.9 +/- 1.2 dynes.s.cm-5.10(2) (p less than 0.05) and cardiac output increased from 4.8 +/- 0.2 to 5.3 +/- 0.3 liters/min (p less than 0.05) without changing leg blood flow.

Exercise heart rate was higher with nisoldipine (113 +/- 4 vs 106 +/- 4 beats/min, p less than 0.01), but the mean arterial pressure was not significantly changed, giving a higher rate-pressure product. The increase in mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure was attenuated (26 +/- 3 vs 30 +/- 3 mm Hg during control exercise, p less than 0.05), but ST depression was unaltered. Exercise leg flow was reduced by nisoldipine from 4.3 +/- 0.4 to 3.9 +/- 0.3 liters/min (p = 0.07) and the proportion of cardiac output distributed to the legs was reduced from 42 +/- 3 to 33 +/- 3% (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ten normal subjects and 29 patients with stable angina pectoris and single-vessel coronary artery narrowing (greater than or equal to 75% luminal diameter stenosis in only 1-vessel) participated. Of the 29 patients, 5 had left main coronary artery disease (CAD), 14 had left anterior descending CAD, 4 had right CAD and 6 had left circumflex CAD. The exercise-induced ST depression with R-wave amplitude correction was defined as the exercise-induced ST depression divided by the R-wave amplitude. The 20 points of the lead system were divided into 4 areas: the left main, left anterior descending, right and left circumflex coronary arteries. Coronary artery narrowing was supposed to be in an artery corresponding to the area where the maximal value of the exercise-induced ST depression with and without R-wave amplitude correction was situated. By applying R-wave amplitude correction, the diagnostic ability of localization of coronary artery narrowings was improved significantly from 52% to 86% (p less than 0.005). In particular, localization of the left main coronary artery narrowing was correctly diagnosed in 100% (5 of 5) of angina pectoris patients with left main CAD.\r"

To investigate the electrophysiologic determinants of this effect, changes in the cycle length, the effective refractory period and the excitable gap of spontaneous type I atrial flutter were studied in 11 patients given intravenous disopyramide (3 mg/kg in 1 hour). After drug infusion, the cycle length of atrial flutter increased from 238 +/- 26 to 298 +/- 38 ms (+25%; p less than 0.001) and the effective refractory period prolonged from 169 +/- 19 to 192 +/- 25 ms (+14%; p less than 0.01). The excitable gap prolonged from 62 +/- 16 to 96 +/- 27 ms (+55%; p less than 0.001). Atrial flutter was terminated by overdrive pacing (mean cycle 203) in 10 of 11 patients; in 1 patient atrial fibrillation resulted after high rate stimulation. In the setting of an anatomically defined reentry circuit, as in type I atrial flutter, the administration of disopyramide prolongs both cycle length and refractory period. The finding of an increased excitable gap suggests that the drug exerts its prominent effect by depressing conduction velocity. A wider excitable gap allows easier penetration of the stimulus in the reentry circuit and accounts for the beneficial effects of type IA antiarrhythmic drugs on the termination of atrial flutter by overdrive pacing.\r"

Such pacemakers are dependent on a nonatrial sensor of physiologic needs to optimize the rate response. Fifty rate-adaptive right ventricular pacemakers were implanted in 46 patients with a mean age of 60 +/- 4 years (mean +/- standard error of the mean). There were 2 types of activity-sensing pacemakers (Activitrax and Sensolog 702), the QT-sensing pacemakers (TX2 and Quintech), 2 types of respiratory-sensing pacemakers (Biorate [RDP3 and MB1] and Meta) and a rate-adaptive pacemaker that senses right ventricular dP/dt (Deltatrax). The rate responses of a group of 9 volunteers of similar age (62 +/- 2 years) were also included for comparison. Improvement in exercise duration in the rate-adaptive mode compared to the constant-rate ventricular pacing (VVI) mode was achieved during randomized symptom-limited treadmill exercise (from 26 to 49%). Compared with the sinus responses, the activity-sensing pacemakers responded most appropriately in speed. However, their rate responses were not related to workload and had lower correlations with estimated oxygen consumption (r = 0.7 and 0.47 for Activitrax and Sensolog, respectively). Respiratory-sensing pacemakers responded more appropriately in magnitude (r greater than 0.8) although their rate responses were slower. All pacemakers studied either showed no response or a reverse-rate response to the Valsalva maneuver. It is concluded that the currently available rate-adaptive ventricular pacemakers improve exercise performance compared with VVI pacemakers in patients with bradycardias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The decrease in potassium persisted for at least 45 minutes after discontinuing the infusion. Three patients had exacerbation of baseline ventricular arrhythmias that resolved with infusion discontinuation. Changes in plasma norepinephrine could not explain the potassium decrease or arrhythmia production, which also significantly decreased in these patients (771 +/- 123 to 524 +/- 73 pg/ml, p less than 0.01).

The study was randomized and double-blind, with a crossover sequence. Hemodynamics were measured by CO2 rebreathing at rest and at 25, 50, 75 and 100% of VO2 max. After placebo, cardiac output increased from 5.8 +/- 2.1 (rest), to 19.4 +/- 6.4 liters/min (100% VO2 max), mainly due to an increase in heart rate from 84 +/- 6 to 169 +/- 15 beats/min.

The enhancement of RV filling was similar for early and late diastolic filling, since each of the variables generated from their ratios were not significantly changed with inspiration. Inspiration significantly enhances RV venous return, while the LV response to inspiration is a complex interplay among preload, afterload and ventricular interdependence. Assessment of pediatric RV and LV diastolic function should include standardization for phase of respiration.\r"

Sixty-eight patients ages 1 day to 68 years who underwent cardiac catheterization had Doppler studies of the right and left ventricular outflows. Preejection period (PEP), ejection time (ET) and mean acceleration to peak velocity (ACCm) were measured on each waveform. The expression: F = (PEP x ACCm)/ET was calculated for right and left ventricular outflows as an index of the effects that the interaction between ventricular contraction and afterload has on the shape of the Doppler waveforms generated in each outflow. The quotient of (F for the right outflow)/(F for the left outflow), or waveform contour ratio, was used to express the degree of pressure-dependent variability between each subject's right and left ventricular outflow tracings. The waveform contour ratio was strikingly similar to the ratio of systolic pulmonary to systemic pressures and also closely correlated to the ratio of mean pressures. The product of waveform contour ratio and arm systolic pressure gave a consistently accurate estimate of systolic pulmonary pressures. It is concluded that the present method can be used successfully for the noninvasive assessment of pulmonary arterial pressures.\r"

To better assess long-term outcome, 257 consecutive patients with successful PTCA of a total occlusion with late angiographic follow-up from 484 patients (53%) with PTCA success were reviewed. The mean +/- standard deviation patient age was 54 +/- 10 years, 79% were men, the duration of total occlusion was 11 +/- 15 weeks and the post-PTCA diameter stenosis was 24 +/- 12%. Eighty-two, 27 and 63% of patients received long-term aspirin, dipyridamole and warfarin therapy, respectively. Angiography at 8 +/- 8 months demonstrated restenosis (greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis) in 41% of patients restudied within 6 months and in 66% of patients restudied within 12 months by life table analysis. In multivariate regression analysis of 19 variables, 2 were independently correlated with the occurrence of restenosis: post-PTCA diameter stenosis greater than 30% (p = 0.02) and coronary artery dilated (left anterior descending and right coronary arteries greater than the left circumflex coronary artery) (p = 0.05). In log rank analysis that also considered the timing of angiographic detection of restenosis, dilatation of a proximal left anterior descending stenosis was also a significant predictor of restenosis (p = 0.01), and dilatation within 4 weeks of the presumed time of occlusion was only weakly predictive (p = 0.11).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Repeat PTCA was successful in 181 (92%) of these patients. After a successful second PTCA, 47 patients (26%) developed a second restenosis (recurrent restenosis group, group 1) and 134 (single restenosis group, group 2) did not. The 2 patient groups were compared with respect to clinical, angiographic and procedural factors at second PTCA. Univariate correlates of a second restenosis were younger age (54 +/- 10 vs 57 +/- 9 years, p less than 0.05), interval less than 60 days between initial PTCA and recurrence of anginal symptoms (55% of patients in group 1 vs 25% in group 2, p = 0.001), a greater number of inflations (6.3 +/- 4.2 vs 4.4 +/- 2.5, p less than 0.005) and a shorter maximal balloon inflation time (49 +/- 26 vs 69 +/- 36 seconds, p = 0.0006). With multivariate analysis, the 2 factors that emerged as independent predictors of recurrent restenosis were recurrence of symptoms less than 60 days after initial PTCA (p less than 0.004) and a greater number of inflations (p less than 0.04). These data suggest that younger age and rapid recurrence of anginal symptoms after first PTCA predict an increased likelihood that a second restenosis will occur after repeat PTCA and that certain procedural factors, in particular the greater number of balloon inflations and a shorter maximal balloon inflation time, may play an important role in the development of recurrent restenosis.\r"

The frequency of rupture of the left ventricular free wall or ventricular septum among necropsy patients with fatal AMI studied in this laboratory since 1968 was analyzed. Of 648 such patients, 204 (31%) had rupture of the left ventricular free wall or ventricular septum. Rupture occurred in 171 (40%) of 431 patients without healed myocardial infarcts (grossly visible left ventricular scars), and in 29 (13%) of 217 patients with a healed myocardial infarct (p less than 0.01). Thus, the frequency of rupture of the left ventricular free wall or ventricular septum during AMI appears to have increased substantially since the widespread use of coronary care units. Also, the frequency of rupture is nearly 3 times greater in those in whom rupture occurred during the first AMI compared to those with a previous infarct that healed.\r"

In men with mild, moderate or severe breathlessness, the prevalence rates of angina were 16, 29 and 41%, respectively. The association between breathlessness and angina was independent of age or cigarette smoking, with similar relations observed in men who had never smoked. The prevalence of electrocardiograms revealing ischemia increased with the severity of breathlessness, even in men without angina or other evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) at screening. In men with a low forced expiratory volume in 1 second, the prevalence of angina was also increased, but the association was much weaker than that observed between angina and breathlessness. After a 5-year follow-up, 25% of men severely breathless at screening but without any initial evidence of CAD had developed angina, 5% had had a heart attack (half of these were fatal) and 7% were dead from causes other than CAD. The corresponding rates for men not breathless at screening and without evidence of CAD were: 4% angina, 2.5% heart attack and 2% dead from causes other than CAD. Breathlessness appears to be an early indicator of CAD in the absence of either angina or electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia.\r"

The data were compared with those of 50 control subjects free from cardiac disease. Only 12 hyperthyroid patients (32%) had complex ventricular arrhythmias (Lown grade 3 or 4) as compared with 6 normal subjects (12%, p greater than 0.05). Three patients (8%) had repetitive ventricular arrhythmias (Lown grade 4A/B) as compared with 4 normal subjects (8%, p greater than 0.05). Supraventricular premature complexes occurred more often in hyperthyroid patients than in normal subjects before and after therapy (p less than 0.001). The prevalence of supraventricular tachycardia decreased from 8 patients to 1 during therapy (p less than 0.002). The HR decreased from 95 +/- 13 to 79 +/- 9 beats/min after therapy, but was still increased as compared with the normal subjects (72 +/- 8 beats/min, p less than 0.001). A day/night difference in HR greater than 10% was found in 32 patients (86%) and was more pronounced than in the normal group (p less than 0.001). Compared with the normal HR profile, the HR curve of hyperthyroid patients was shifted to a higher level (about 20 beats/min). Serum T3 level correlated best with HR at night in hyperthyroid patients (r = 0.74, p less than 0.001). Thus, hyperthyroid patients show frequent supraventricular arrhythmias that might be reversible during therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Stroke volume index and cardiac index were determined by suprasternal Doppler measurements. Compared with the findings during VVI pacing, the rate-responsive pacing was associated with (1) prolongation of exercise duration (8.0 +/- 4.0 vs 7.3 +/- 3.6 minutes, p less than 0.05); (2) greater exercise-induced positive chronotropic response (mean maximal heart rate 127 +/- 12 vs 78 +/- 15 beats/min, p less than 0.001); (3) smaller increase in stroke volume index (38 +/- 10 vs 50 +/- 11 ml/m2, p less than 0.001), and (4) greater increase in cardiac index (4.7 +/- 1.1 vs 3.9 +/- 1.0 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.001). A significant correlation was observed between age and percent increase in stroke volume index during VVI pacing (p less than 0.05). These findings indicate that VVI pacing increased stroke volume more than did rate-responsive pacing, especially in younger patients, but the increase in cardiac output was less than that seen with rate-responsive pacing due to the absence of chronotropic response. Accordingly, an activity-sensing, rate-responsive pacemaker can effectively increase the heart rate, significantly augment cardiac output and extend the duration of exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The right ventricle was investigated by multiple biopsies and detailed echocardiographic evaluation, including measurement of cavity dimensions at the level of the inflow, body and outflow tract, in 27 patients with right ventricular tachycardia who had no clinical evidence of an underlying morphologic abnormality. Nine (33%) patients had abnormal biopsy results, with a quantifiable increase in interstitial fibrosis. Abnormal echocardiograms, defined as an increase in greater than or equal to 2 dimensions of the right ventricular cavity or wall motion abnormalities or both, were seen in 9 patients. There was a strong association between abnormal myocardial histologies and abnormal right ventricular echocardiograms (p less than 0.001). An abnormal echocardiogram was 94% specific and 80% sensitive for an abnormal biopsy. The findings of echocardiography and biopsy were correlated with the electrocardiographic features of the tachycardia. Evidence of right ventricular disease was seen in all 6 patients with superior frontal plane axis of clinical tachycardia as compared with 4 of 21 with inferior axis (p less than 0.001). Thus, 2-dimensional echocardiography is a sensitive means of diagnosing right ventricular disease in patients with nonischemic tachycardias of left bundle branch block morphology. A superior frontal plane axis of ventricular tachycardia in this group strongly suggests right ventricular disease, whereas an inferior frontal plane axis is frequently not associated with any morphologic or histologic abnormality of the right ventricle.\r"

Peak oxygen uptake increased by 14% (p less than 0.001) and the physical working capacity at a heart rate of 130 beats/min by 25% (p less than 0.001). The heart rate was reduced by 7 beats/min at night (p less than 0.01) and by 6 beats/min during the day (p less than 0.001). Training-induced changes of BP varied according to measuring conditions. A decrease in BP at rest while sitting in the morning in the laboratory was significant for diastolic (-5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) but not for systolic BP. During exercise, systolic BP was significantly lower after training, when measured at the same submaximal workloads. However, when workload was expressed as a percentage of peak oxygen uptake, systolic BP was not different before and after training. When measured during 24 hours, the training-induced change in BP was not significant at night either for systolic or diastolic BP. During the day the decrease in diastolic BP was significant (-5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), but the change in systolic BP was not.\r"

Myocardial lymphocytic infiltration was present in 8 (13%). Three had myocyte degeneration and necrosis (\"definite\" myocarditis), whereas the other 5 had no degeneration or necrosis (\"equivocal\" myocarditis). Compared with the 53 without lymphocytic infiltration, these 8 patients more often had symptoms of a preceding viral illness (88 vs 30%, p = 0.002) and had a shorter duration of cardiac symptoms (18 +/- 18 vs 109 +/- 132 days [mean +/- standard deviation], p less than 0.001). Histologic features of the biopsy did not relate to survival, but right- and left-sided intracardiac pressures were higher (p less than 0.05) in nonsurvivors. Thus, (1) endomyocardial biopsy is most likely to show lymphocytic infiltration in patients with symptoms of a preceding viral illness and a short duration of cardiac symptoms, and (2) right- and left-sided hemodynamic variables at the time of biopsy may offer insight into prognosis.\r"

All valves were thought to be functioning normally by clinical examination. Valve competence was interrogated and peak and mean velocities were measured by standard pulsed wave, continuous wave and color Doppler techniques. Prosthetic valve area was calculated and compared to the known valve area. Mild prosthetic valve regurgitation was present in 8 of 22 mitral and 7 of 10 aortic prostheses. For mitral prostheses, peak velocity was 192 +/- 41 cm/s, mean velocity was 118 +/- 37 cm/s and mean gradient was 7 +/- 4 mm Hg. For aortic prostheses, peak velocity was 287 +/- 88 cm/s, mean velocity was 197 +/- 59 cm/s, peak gradient was 36 +/- 21 mm Hg and mean gradient was 19 +/- 11 mm Hg. Prosthetic mitral valve area, calculated by the pressure half-time and modified Gorlin methods, correlated well with the known valve area (r = 0.89, standard error of the estimate = 0.29 and r = 0.95, standard error of the estimate = 0.21, respectively). Prosthetic aortic valve area, calculated by the modified Gorlin method, correlated well with the known valve area (r = 0.89, standard error of the estimate = 0.18). Residual valvular abnormalities are common after prosthetic valve insertion in children. Doppler estimates of prosthetic valve area correlate well with the known valve area but have a large standard error of the estimate.\r"

Energy intakes may vary from low to high and the main source of energy may be carbohydrate or fat. These findings are in keeping with experimental evidence that a low ratio of protein to energy disrupts the usual hypometabolic response to dietary deficiency and leads to hypoalbuminemia and consequent edema. Protein supplements should be a part of programs aimed at preventing kwashiorkor.\r"

Data were analyzed for day-to-day variability and regression analyses were applied to compare the different methods of measuring BC. Mean values (+/- SEM, kg) for the estimates were 53.9 +/- 3.5 (FFWT), 26.9 +/- 2.9 (MM3MH), 25.3 +/- 2.5 (MMCRE), 53.2 +/- 3.6 (FFWBD), and 52.8 +/- 3.5 (LBMK). Regression analyses revealed that TOBEC estimates of fat-free weight had an adjusted r2 (+/- SEE, kg) of 0.95 +/- 2.2, 0.50 +/- 7.9, 0.95 +/- 1.8, and 0.88 +/- 4.0 for MM3MH, MMCRE, FFWBD, and LBMK, respectively.

Normal physiologic changes in milk composition after parturition (decreases in Na and increases in lactose) and during individual feeding periods (increases in fat and decreases in protein) were observed. Concentrations of milk protein, fat, and sugars were normal when the pulmonary disease of these patients was mild. During exacerbations of pulmonary disease, the concentrations of milk macronutrients were reduced. Milk secreted by women with CF appears to be physiologically normal, safe for the infant, and breast-feeding by mothers with CF should no longer be discouraged.

Serum carnitine concentrations were lower in all infants fed unsupplemented formula. There was no difference in growth or food intake between the two groups of infants. Serum free fatty acid concentrations were significantly higher in the infants not receiving dietary carnitine. Moreover, excretion of all three medium-chain dicarboxylic acids was significantly higher in infants not receiving dietary carnitine.

The findings also revealed that high serum levels of total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol were associated with high cholesterol absorption and that of HDL cholesterol was associated also with low synthesis and fecal elimination of cholesterol. Thus, cholesterol absorption efficiency and absorbed dietary cholesterol significantly regulate cholesterol synthesis and elimination and are important determinants of within-population variation in the serum levels of total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol.\r"

Protein digestibility was not significantly affected by vitamin B-6 intake. Apparent nitrogen balance of subjects consuming AP diets was slightly, though not significantly, higher than that of subjects fed PP diets. N balance was not influenced by vitamin B-6 intake. Data suggest that short-term low vitamin B-6 intake does not affect protein utilization in humans as determined by digestibility and N balance.\r"

The treatment order was reversed for the other half. When breakfast was omitted, both the stunted and previously malnourished groups responded similarly. The malnourished groups had lower scores in fluency and coding whereas the control group had higher scores in arithmetic. The children were divided into wasted and nonwasted groups. Wasted children were adversely affected in the digit span backwards tests, and wasted members of the malnourished groups were adversely affected in efficiency of problem solving and those in the control group in digit span forwards. These results indicate that cognitive functions are more vulnerable to missing breakfast in poorly nourished children.\r"

  ".W": "Hydrogen breath tests were performed in eight children with sickle cell disease (Hgb S-S), four of whom were growth retarded. Average base-line breath H2 values after an overnight fast were elevated (22.4 +/- 10.8 ppm; normal = 7.1 +/- 5.0). Breath H2 concentrations increased significantly above base line within 30-40 min after lactulose ingestion in the four growth-retarded children whereas a negligible rise was observed in the four with normal growth indices. Breath H2 production for each time interval in the first 120 min was greater in all Hgb S-S then in normal children (p less than 0.01 for each time interval measured before 60 min). The results indicate that children with sickle cell disease have intestinal abnormalities favoring excess production of H2 in the fasted state combined with early elevations in postlactulose breath H2 in those with growth retardation. The possible role of disordered gastrointestinal motility and/or anomalously distributed intestinal flora in growth retardation of children with Hgb S-S requires further investigation.\r"

Patients were given glucose alone, fructose alone, glucose + fructose, lactose, and glucose + fat + protein. Fructose given alone increased the blood glucose almost as much as a similar amount of glucose (78% of the glucose-alone area, p less than 0.05). However, the same amount of fructose given with glucose produced no greater glycemic response than did glucose alone (108%). Similarly, galactose contributed only slightly to the glycemic response when given as lactose (122%, p less than 0.01) whereas protein and fat had no additional glycemic effect (101%). To test the above hypothesis in natural foods, patients were fed an amount of bread (high glycemic index) or apple (low glycemic index) that contained 25 g glucose. Both challenges produced glycemic responses very similar to 25 g purified glucose.\r"

Uptake of 0.06 mumol retinol/L bound to BLG (BLG-retinol) was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than that of 0.06 mumol free retinol/L both in the jejunum and the ileum. The enhancing effect of BLG on retinol uptake was specific because equimolar concentrations of bovine serum albumin and lactoferrin had no effect on retinol uptake. However, serum retinol-binding protein (RBP), which shares structural and conformational similarities with BLG, also enhanced retinol uptake. BLG, BLG-retinol, and RBP-retinol all inhibited the uptake of retinol from BLG-[3H]retinol in a concentration-dependent manner. Uptake of retinol from BLG-retinol was saturable (apparent Km = 5.6 mumol/L, Vmax = 22.7 nmol.g-1.5 min-1), not affected by metabolic inhibitors, and partially temperature dependent (Q10 = 2.77). BLG also significantly (p less than 0.01) enhanced retinol uptake in the intestine of adult rats. These results demonstrate that BLG specifically enhances intestinal uptake of retinol and suggest the possibility of a receptor for BLG-like proteins at the brush border membrane of the enterocyte.\r"

Zn concentrations of tumor-bearing mice were also low compared with control mice but tumor Zn concentrations, regardless of the concentrations of Zn in the diets, were higher than those of normal tissues of the host other than the pancreas. Ca concentrations in tumor and tissues of tumor-bearing mice were higher than in control animals but Mg concentrations in tissues of tumor-bearing mice appeared to be similar to those of control mice. Results suggest that tumor-bearing mice have a lower intestinal Zn absorption capacity and a higher Zn uptake rate causing other tissues to become hypozincemic and hypercalcemic.\r"

The proportions of cell nuclei arbitrarily designated \"dark\" were determined for each whole tumor and for their above-mentioned invasive compartments and were compared with the tumor's nuclear grade, mitotic index, gross size, axillary metastatic status, and hormone receptivity. Well-differentiated tumors tended to have more cells with \"dark\" nuclei and more of the tumor mass invading the stroma as \"thin\" strands than poorly differentiated ones. Tumors that had axillary metastases also tended to have high mitotic indices, low proportions of cells with \"dark\" nuclei (and conversely high proportions of cells with vesicular nuclei) in confluent sheets. Tumors that had positive results for one or both hormone receptors had a greater component of trabecular stromal invasion than tumors with negative results for both hormone receptors that grew as confluent cell sheets. It is suggested that tumor cell nuclear staining \"density\" might be a clinically useful prognostic index despite the finding that semiquantitative assessments of nuclear density can be modified by the mode of stromal invasion.\r"

This case was unusual in that foregut communications and associated congenital anomalies are generally believed to be restricted to extralobar pulmonary sequestrations. The second case was that of a 27-year-old woman with an extralobar pulmonary sequestration that communicated with the esophagus. The sequestration was unusual in that it arose in the anterior mediastinum and received the bulk of its blood supply from the pulmonary artery. The occurrence of mixed forms of pulmonary sequestrations supports the hypothesis that extralobar and intralobar sequestrations and sequestrations with foregut communication are related thoracic disorders that are best considered bronchopulmonary foregut malformations.\r"

One patient demonstrated a mixed immunophenotype with HLA-DR, My7, transferrin receptor surface markers, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase positivity. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first ALL-HMV reported with myeloid antigen. The patient died during induction and did not demonstrate the indolent course noted in the female subgroup with this disorder. The second case initially was not an ALL-HMV but presented as a non-T non-B ALL, and the patient had a relapse six years later with numerous hand mirror cells (HMCs). In the authors' experience, this is the first case of ALL that presented as a non-HMC and relapsed as an ALL-HMV. The patient's immunophenotype revealed he was HLA-DR, transferrin receptor, and TdT positive. Both patients' leukemic cells showed a diffuse granular periodic acid-Schiff on a clear background and acid phosphatase-positive pattern. Immunogenetics revealed a clonal rearrangement of one of the two Ig heavy chain loci in the one patient evaluated. Western blot analysis of the bone marrow plasma of both patients with ALL-HMV showed an increase of cross-reactive IgG to the envelope gp70 and IgM against the core p30 proteins of the baboon endogenous virus (BaEV) and simian sarcoma-associated virus (SSAV). Furthermore, their bone marrow plasma demonstrated IgM antibodies to the gp70 that were not present in any of the other non-hand mirror leukemic patients or the normal controls. These findings strengthen the concept that HMCs in ALL are formed in relation to an immunologic response to increased proteins related to BaEV and/or SSAV.\r"

The shortening of the ACT by lysed platelets followed a typical dose-response relationship. Fractionation of lysed platelet preparations revealed that the procoagulant membrane fraction, not the cytosol fraction containing PF4, was responsible for this effect of lysed platelets on the ACT. These findings demonstrate that the ACT can be artifactually low in the presence of heparin, indicating a potential problem in the use of the ACT for monitoring of heparin neutralization.\r"

The authors studied the accuracy and precision of this method for paraprotein determination. Twenty-seven serum samples with paraprotein concentrations ranging from 5 to 73 g/L were aliquotted and assayed on 20 separate occasions, and the mean and standard deviation for the paraprotein concentration in each serum was established. Linear regression analysis showed that the standard deviation of paraprotein concentration (SD) increased as a function of paraprotein concentration (PC). For IgG paraproteins, the regression equation was SD = 0.041 (PC) + 1.06; R = 0.942; standard error = 0.32. For non-IgG paraproteins the equation was SD = 0.101 (PC) - 0.04; R = 0.851; standard error = 0.5. The accuracy of paraprotein determinations by the agarose gel electrophoretic technique was assessed by comparison with values obtained with the use of a previously validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for quantitation of IgG subclasses. Results obtained by the two methods were similar and highly correlated: (concentration by electrophoresis) = 0.921 (concentration by ELISA) + 0.46; R = 0.988; standard error = 0.34. The laser densitometric scanning procedure showed a loss of linearity above 60 g/L, indicating the need to dilute sera with very high paraprotein concentrations in order to obtain accurate results. A table is presented that should help pathologists who interpret such scans to determine whether small changes in paraprotein measurements occurring over time represent true changes in paraprotein concentration or merely reflect the analytic variability inherent in the technique.\r"

In the present report the authors have measured luminol and lucigenin-enhanced CL in whole blood from 63 untreated patients with cancer. In particular, the lucigenin-enhanced CL was increased in patients with cancer (P less than 0.001). No relation to origin or spread of the cancer was obvious. Monocyte number in peripheral blood was also significantly (P less than 0.01) increased as compared with age-matched controls. Further, the lucigenin-enhanced CL of purified monocytes, but not that of purified polymorphonuclear leukocyte(s) (PMNs), correlated significantly (P = 0.002) with the activity of whole blood. The authors conclude therefore that the highly increased lucigenin-enhanced CL observed in whole blood of a patient with cancer may reflect the enhanced production and activity of circulating monocytes that is a consequence of the body's defense reactions toward the developing cancer.\r"

Measures were examined with the use of turnaround time data from 11,070 stat partial thromboplastin times, 16,761 urine cultures, and 28,055 stat electrolyte panels performed by a single laboratory. For laboratories with long turnaround times, the most important quality of a turnaround time measure is high reproducibility, so that improvement in reporting speed can be distinguished from random variation resulting from sampling. The mean was found to be the most reproducible of the four measures, followed by the median. The mean achieved acceptable precision with sample sizes of 100-500 tests. For laboratories with normally rapid turnaround times, the most important quality of a measure is high sensitivity and specificity for detecting whether turnaround time has dropped below standards. The PAT was found to be the best measure of turnaround time in this setting but required sample sizes of at least 500 tests to achieve acceptable accuracy. Laboratory turnaround time may be measured for different reasons. The method of measurement should be chosen with an eye toward its intended application.\r"

DNA probes and anti-EBV antibodies were controlled for activity by assessment of human blood B-lymphocytes after in vitro infection with EBV. None of the tissues investigated manifested the presence of EBV proteins (nuclear antigen, early antigen R, membrane antigen, or viral capsid antigen). The salivary gland biopsies of four patients with primary SS and two with secondary SS showed EBV-DNA in epithelial cells of acini and ducts but not in other components. The authors data contrast with those of Fox and colleagues (J Immunol 1986;137:3162-3168), who reported that about half of the patients with SS have EBV early antigen D in epithelium of the sublabial salivary gland. The authors conclude that an active EBV infection associated with EBV protein synthesis does not occur in the diseased salivary gland of patients with SS, but the presence of EBV-DNA in the glands does not exclude a possible role of EBV in the disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The breakpoint cluster region gene rearrangement associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia is becoming important in the diagnosis and management of the disease. At this time, the ability to demonstrate the gene rearrangement is limited to a few research laboratories. The problem results partially from unfamiliarity of medical laboratory personnel with DNA technology, but more because of the restricted use of radiolabeled phosphorus in hospital laboratories. With the introduction of biotinylated deoxynucleotides, nucleic acid hybridization procedures can now be performed without the use of radioisotopically labeled gene probes. This article describes the use of biotin-labeled gene probes to detect the gene rearrangement of the breakpoint cluster region of chromosome 22 in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The techniques are reproducible, sensitive, and safe. With the procedures described in this article, the assay can become more available to medical laboratories interested in offering this diagnostic and decision-making tool.\r"

  ".W": "Blood salvage techniques and increasingly conservative physician transfusion practice in cardiac surgery have led to reports of homologous blood exposure in as few as 10% of patients having elective cardiac revascularization surgery (Ann Thorac Surg 1985;40:380). To identify current prevailing transfusion practice between centers, the authors prospectively audited 49 and 29 consecutive adult elective open-heart surgery cases (78 total) at two centers. Thirty-six of 49 patients (73%) received 245 homologous blood units (HBs) at institution 1 (m = 5.0). Fifteen of 29 (52%) received 84 HBs at institution 2 (m = 2.9, P less than 0.05). Sex, age, duration of surgery, intraoperative blood salvaged, preoperative hematocrit (Hct), nadir Hct, and nadir platelet counts, and the surgeon were all found to be determinants of transfusion practice at institution 1 but not at the other. The data indicate that (1) determinants of homologous blood exposure are not consistent between institutions and instead reflect \"prevailing practice\" rather than need; (2) a prospective multi-institution audit of prevailing transfusion practice in cardiac revascularization is needed to address this; (3) autologous blood pre-deposit is underused in open-heart surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical significance of Bence Jones (BJ) proteinuria at low concentration (less than 0.2 g/24 hours) was investigated in 33 unselected patients who had no intact monoclonal immunoglobulin in their serum. The great majority (79%) of the patients were recognized as having malignant lymphoproliferative diseases, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (46%), hairy cell leukemia (6%), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (27%), whereas only two patients (6%) had multiple myeloma or systemic amyloidosis. Five patients (15%) had no evidence of definite malignant immunoproliferative disorders at the time of recognition of BJ proteinuria. Three of them, who were excreting steadily low amounts of BJ protein in their urine for 47, 61, and 73 months, respectively, without development of any B-lymphocytic malignancy, were classified as having a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. In the remaining two patients, BJ protein disappeared spontaneously 14 and 18 months, respectively, after its recognition. The study indicates that pure BJ proteinuria, even when occurring at low concentration, is most consistently associated with malignant proliferations of B-lymphocytic origin. However, the possibility should be considered that the clinical spectrum of the monoclonal gammopathy of the light chain type also includes benign and transient forms.\r"

The second tumor became symptomatic eight months after the initial diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease, but a tissue diagnosis was not made until autopsy two months later. The Hodgkin's disease was, at that time, in remission, and the autopsy revealed no persistent or recurrent Hodgkin's disease. Despite radiotherapy, the brain lymphoma had progressed to involve the spinal leptomeninges extensively, but there was no lymphoma outside the central nervous system (CNS) at autopsy. The significance of this unique case is discussed in light of the known risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as a second malignancy after Hodgkin's disease and in view of recent information concerning CNS lymphoma.\r"

Phosphorus NMR spectroscopy in vivo can measure ATP and other phosphometabolites, intracellular pH, and free Mg2+. It has been applied to diagnosing inborn errors of metabolism such as glycogen storage disease, monitoring growth and regression of tumors, and assessing tissue viability. The basics of NMR spectroscopy are reviewed in this article, along with a survey of applications in human pathology.\r"

Components of a telepathology system include the following: (1) a workstation equipped with a high-resolution video camera attached to a remote-controlled light microscope; (2) a pathologist workstation incorporating controls for manipulating the robotic microscope as well as a high-resolution video monitor; and (3) a telecommunications link. Progress has been made in designing and constructing telepathology workstations and fully motorized, computer-controlled light microscopes suitable for telepathology. In addition, components such as video signal digital encoders and decoders that produce remarkably stable, high-color fidelity, and high-resolution images have been incorporated into the workstations. Resolution requirements for the video microscopy component of telepathology have been formally examined in receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Test-of-concept demonstrations have been completed with the use of geostationary satellites as the broadband communication linkages for 750-line resolution video. Potential benefits of telepathology include providing a means of conveniently delivering pathology services in real-time to remote sites or underserviced areas, time-sharing of pathologists' services by multiple institutions, and increasing accessibility to specialty pathologists.\r"

Such systems offer the potential for consistency and setting standards in the diagnostic evaluation of difficult situations. Diagnostic clues as offered by the image represent two-dimensional information. Their description is entered into the knowledge base of an aspect system, however, in the form of a description, which is one-dimensional. Preserving all of the two-dimensional dependence structure in this conversion is a fundamental problem. Use of the description to generate simulated imagery tests whether or not the two-dimensional dependence structure of a given tissue architecture has been adequately represented in the analytic description. This analytic description would then be entered into the knowledge base of an expert system.\r"

Children assigned to treatment showed significantly greater relative weight and weight changes than children in the control group, and the weight changes were significantly related to reductions in fasting serum triglyceride and total serum cholesterol levels and increases in high-density lipoprotein serum cholesterol. Results after 5 years of follow-up available for a small sample of treated children showed that a change in relative weight and fitness from 6 months to 5 years was also associated with changes in the high-density lipoprotein level. These results suggest that weight control in obese preadolescent children may be associated with improvement in lipoprotein profiles.\r"

Thirty-seven patients, aged 2 to 27 years, were instructed to consume a nonrestricted fat diet during an intervention period of 4 years. The results showed that patients increased the mean energy intake significantly to a level of more than 120% of the recommended daily allowance. The enhanced intake resulted in significant weight gain. Pulmonary function (forced expiratory flow 25%-75%) deteriorated during the 2-year preintervention period but stabilized during the 4-year intervention period. Both male and female patients were able to maintain their established height and weight scores during adolescence. The recommendation for a high-energy diet with no restrictions placed on the fat intake and the control of the steatorrhea by administration of an optimal enzyme dosage is supported by our data. Individualized nutritional counseling should be attempted before implementing invasive nutritional intervention programs.\r"

A stepwise regression analysis was used to examine relationships between the dependent variables of reading and mathematics and the independent variables of socioeconomic status, school attendance, medical factors relating to asthma, age, and emotional and behavioral problems of the children. Factors that were associated significantly with low performance scores were low socioeconomic status, older age, history of continuous oral steroid use (prednisone or methyl prednisolone taken at least every other day for the year prior to evaluation), and presence of emotional and behavioral problems. School absenteeism, use of medical resources, oral steroid dosage, other medications used to treat asthma, and pulmonary functions were not associated with academic performance. Investigation of poor classroom performance of a child with chronic asthma should include investigation of the roles of socioeconomic status, oral steroid therapy, and emotional and behavioral problems.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluating the significance of alarms at home in infants monitored for apnea/bradycardia depends on subjective parental observations. Retrospective analysis of 165 event recordings made during alarms in 90 monitored infants indicated that alarms were due to prolonged (greater than 15 s) apnea (6%), bradycardia (14%), shallow breathing (19%), mechanical malfunction (55%), or other causes (6%). Also, 68 infants had pneumograms. Of the 37 infants with an abnormal pneumogram, 14% had an abnormal event recording. Of the 31 infants with a normal pneumogram, 16% had an abnormal event recording. All monitors were discontinued without complication after a negative event recording. It may be concluded that (1) event recordings can document cardiorespiratory patterns during alarms, (2) the majority of alarms occurring at home are not significant, and (3) pneumograms do not appear to indicate which infants are at risk for a future significant alarm.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one pediatricians specializing in allergy, pulmonology, or both were questioned about their use of adrenergic bronchodilators for treating children of different ages at home, in the emergency department, and in the hospital. Most would use inhaled medications in all settings and for all ages. Few expressed strong preference for one drug over another, but only 2 would regularly use nebulized isoproterenol hydrochloride or isoetharine hydrochloride. Dosing frequency of inhaled medication at home was usually limited to every 4 hours, but in the emergency department or hospital, intervals between doses of 20 minutes or less were common. If this treatment failed, 9 physicians would use intravenous isoproterenol, but 4 strongly opposed its use. These results indicate that substantial variation exists in current expert practice, but that inhaled albuterol, metaproterenol, or terbutaline sulfate are most often preferred for treating asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and bronchiolitis in children of all ages, and that doses and dosing intervals are frequently altered to meet patient needs.\r"

Subjects reported minimal use of steroids (1%) and amphetamines (2%), and only a minority would consider their use. As a group, however, male athletes were more likely to believe that steroids were effective (32% vs 13%) and to consider the future use of these agents (14% vs 0) compared with female athletes. The majority of high school athletes believed that supplemental protein or vitamins could improve performance and that their use caused little or no health risk. These data suggest that young athletes may require information regarding the limited benefits and potential risks associated with the use of ergogenic aids.\r"

All patients had fractional inspired oxygen concentration less than 0.6, no spontaneous respirations, hemodynamic stability, and no fever or active infection, and were receiving 5% dextrose. All subjects were hypermetabolic, since the measured resting energy expenditure divided by the predicted basal energy expenditure from the Harris-Benedict equations was 1.48 +/- 0.09 (mean +/- SEM). The energy requirements calculated using \"injury factors\" and \"activity factors\" adapted for adults is 1.62 times basal energy expenditure. The injury factor for the pediatric multiple trauma patients should be 1.25 compared with 1.35 in adults. In these pediatric intensive care patients 33% +/- 8% of the energy is derived from carbohydrates, 53% +/- 8% from fat, and 14% +/- 2% from protein oxidation. In individual critically ill pediatric patients, energy requirements should be estimated by measuring their resting energy expenditure whenever possible and adding 5% for their activity. In the absence of the actual measurement of resting energy expenditure, the recommended energy requirement is 1.5 times basal energy expenditure. In this acute phase of injury, the daily nitrogen requirement is 250 mg per kilogram of body weight.\r"

A total of 116 cases, during the years 1982-1986, were analyzed as to the age, sex, cultural background, cause of death, blood alcohol content at autopsy, and reason for the suicide of the victim. By analyzing the ethnic/cultural backgrounds of the victims, it was noted that the overall rate of suicide among nonwhites in Dade County was 5 per 100,000 population per year. However, the rate varies within the overall group such that black-Hispanics, American Indians, and Haitians have suicide rates of 13.9, 11, and 3.1 per 100,000 population per year, respectively. Some of these rates are higher than the U.S. national nonwhite suicide rate of 7 per 100,000 population. Interestingly, while suicide rates are variable, the reasons listed for the suicide and the high frequency of young adult victims are similar to those for whites. A discussion ensues concerning this similarity and what future work in the field remains to be done.\r"

In examining case material of the Onondaga County Medical Examiner's Office, a characteristic pattern of these ulcerations was seen that was indicative of severe physiologic stress and/or hypothermia. While not pathognomonic of hypothermia, the incidence of the erosions in a specific pattern has been closely associated with deaths in which hypothermia played a significant role. In hypothermia, the erosions, usually shallow and approximately 0.1-0.5 cm in diameter, are set in lines with roughly equidistant spacing, thereby forming a pattern of rectangles with the corners marked by the ulcerations.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine further whether selected tissue metabolites could be used as postmortem markers of antemortem adrenergic stress. Sprague-Dawley albino rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and then injected with 2.0 mg kg-1 i.p. epinephrine hydrochloride to induce experimentally a severe sympathetic response that may be associated with the awareness of mortal danger; 20 min after the injection of epinephrine, when the metabolic response was at its peak, the animals were killed by exsanguination. Samples of the following tissues were removed immediately prior to death (0 h) and 48 h postmortem: soleus, plantaris, kidney medulla, kidney cortex, liver, and heart. These samples were analyzed for glycogen, lactate, ATP, creatine phosphate, pH, and total protein concentration. Significant differences in lactate concentration were observed in all tissues except soleus at 0 h in the epinephrine-injected animals. Specific tissues also had significant reductions in glycogen, ATP, and creatine phosphate concentrations at 0 h. At 48 h postmortem, however, only the liver and soleus lactate concentrations were significantly different from the 48-h control samples. It is unlikely that these small differences found in some tissues at 48 h postmortem would be detected in an uncontrolled accident situation. We concluded from these findings that these selected tissue metabolites are not useful as long-term postmortem indicators of antemortem adrenergically induced hypermetabolism.\r"

In this article, we report a case of sudden death in a 47-year-old white woman due to dissection of the distal segment of her left anterior descending coronary artery. There was marked involvement of the coronary arterial walls with cystic degeneration of the media with accumulation of glycosaminoglycans as demonstrated by Alcian blue staining. There was no eosinophilic infiltrate within the arterial walls. This case is unusual in that this woman's mother and brother both have had aneurysms, which stresses the importance of not only searching carefully for these lesions, but also of obtaining family history in such cases.\r"

  ".W": "Esophageal dilatation by endoscopists is a commonly performed procedure. The introduction of tapered polyvinyl dilators by Savary has made the procedure even more popular. In the United States, esophageal dilatation with guide wires has been traditionally performed with fluoroscopy. By using a marked guide wire and by adhering to specific safety guidelines, the passage of the guide wire can be precise, even without fluoroscopy, and radiographic definition is not always required. This study describes the new guide wire and the technique.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred eighty-nine patients with various chest symptoms were studied by interview for the presence and type of symptoms, and by long-term esophageal pH monitoring for acid reflux. One hundred eighty of the patients also had upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. There was significant correlation between the results of all three methods. pH monitoring was more sensitive (92.9% vs. 81.0%) and specific (41.3% vs. 23.9%), and classified more patients correctly (55.6% vs. 37.2%), than an interview by an experienced gastroenterologist when esophageal erosions were regarded as \"gold standard\" for pathologic reflux. Of all patients, 31.5% had unclear symptoms and therefore could not be diagnosed by interview alone. Forty nine percent of these had pathologic reflux on pH monitoring. Among the patients, 72.3% who had symptoms typical of reflux disease also had a pathologic result at pH monitoring. It is concluded that most patients with unambiguous symptoms of esophageal reflux can correctly be diagnosed by interview, but that esophageal pH monitoring has a role in the management of patients with less characteristic chest symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, has been shown to be useful in the treatment of some patients with chronic diarrhea. Previous animal and human studies have suggested that clonidine alters both small bowel fluid absorption and total gut motility. We measured the effect of clonidine 0.3 mg on oro-cecal transit time, using the lactulose-breath hydrogen test. Intestinal transit time in six normal healthy male volunteers after administration of clonidine was 148 +/- 20 min, and was 90 +/- 7 min with a placebo (p less than 0.05). The average prolongation in transit time was 69.5%. We conclude that clonidine may markedly alter human small intestine transit time which explains, at least in part, the mechanism for this agent's antidiarrheal effect.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between abdominal pain and bowel gas from bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrate was investigated in nine patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), six lactose malabsorbers, and 11 asymptomatic controls. All subjects took breath samples and marked analog scales for abdominal pain, bloating, and psychological stress hourly during all waking hours for 7 days. Breath samples were analyzed for hydrogen concentration within 3 days, and the concentration was corrected for storage time. Symptoms of pain and bloating were significantly more common in IBS patients than in lactose malabsorbers or normal controls, and pain was significantly correlated with bloating in IBS patients. Breath hydrogen concentration was similar in all three groups, and breath hydrogen was not correlated with pain ratings in IBS patients. Thus, abdominal pain may be related to bloating from gastrointestinal gas, but bacterial fermentation cannot be the cause of such gas. The most likely source is swallowed air. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring hydrogen production in the bowel in field studies by having subjects collect hourly breath samples.\r"

Unfortunately, results from the tissue culture cytotoxicity assay are not available for 48 h. We prospectively compared a latex agglutination test with the tissue culture cytotoxicity assay in 83 patients (15 with antibiotic-associated diarrhea, 23 with non-antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and 45 without diarrhea). In the antibiotic-associated diarrhea group, 43% of patients with pseudomembranes and 25% without pseudomembranes tested positive with both tests. In the non-antibiotic groups 92% with diarrhea and 90% without diarrhea were negative with both tests. The number of discordant results illustrates the value of using two tests to identify C. difficile, since additional patients can be identified by using two tests. We found false positives were rare, and C. difficile toxin or antigen could not be detected in more than half the patients with pseudomembranes. The latex agglutination test for C. difficile is reliable, specific, and faster than the tissue culture cytotoxicity assay. The data suggest that other organisms may also be responsible for pseudomembranous colitis, and that negative tests do not obviate the need for visual evaluation of colonic mucosa in suspected cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.\r"

  ".W": "To demonstrate correlation between occurrence of carcinoma and that of gallstone of the gallbladder and biliary tract, we reviewed the protocols of gallbladder and extrahepatic biliary duct carcinoma and cholelithiasis of 4,482 cases (male 2,237, female 2,245, mean age 77.7 yr) autopsied at the Department of Pathology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, during the 27 yr from 1960 to 1986. Gallbladder carcinoma was found in 94 cases, or 2.1%. The incidence was higher in the female than in the male (male 24, female 70, p less than 0.01). Gallstone of the gallbladder was found in 957 cases or 21.4%. In the male, incidences of gallbladder carcinoma and stone increased with age until the lower half of the ninety, whereas in the female, no such tendency was found after the sixties. Incidence of gallbladder carcinoma was significantly higher in the cases with cholecystolithiasis than in those without stone (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, the incidence of gallbladder stones in the cases with relatively early carcinoma was significantly higher than that of those without carcinoma (p less than 0.01). Cholesterol stones were more common than bilirubinate in the carcinoma patients. These results suggest the importance of cholecystolithiasis, especially that of the cholesterol stones, as a background factor of gallbladder carcinoma. Extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas were present in 33 cases or 0.7% (male 19, female 14, no sex preference). The incidence was significantly higher in the cases with stones than in those without stones of the extrahepatic bile ducts (p less than 0.01). However, the fact that small stones were found in the upstream portions of obstruction of biliary tracts and no stone was found at operations in the 11 operated cases suggested that stones may be secondary to the cancerous growth.\r"

Surgical procedures included common bile duct exploration after intraoperative choledochofiberoscopy in 20, with hepatic resection in nine. Overall survival was 8 months, with a range of 3-40 months. The hepatectomy group seemed to have a better prognosis. Accurate preoperative diagnosis of intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma associated with intrahepatic stones is difficult. All 20 patients in this series had surgery for recurrent cholangitis due to intrahepatic stones. From a retrospective review, it became apparent that early diagnosis can be obtained from the following: 1) detection of a hyperechoic mass in the liver parenchyma during abdominal ultrasonography, 2) a scintigraphic defect near the hilum, 3) filling defects or obliteration of intrahepatic ducts in ERCP or PTC, 4) gross appearance of the liver during surgery revealed a nodular tumor mass or an atrophic, fibrotic liver, and 5) intraoperative choledochoscopic findings which showed an intraluminal tumor or infiltrative lesion.\r"

Venous pressures were measured by portal and hepatic vein catheterizations, blood flow by the pulsed Doppler flowmeter, and organ volume by computed tomography. Splenic artery blood flow was 788 +/- 242 ml/min in idiopathic portal hypertension and about four times that in chronic persistent hepatitis (215 +/- 42 ml/min), whereas there was no difference in superior mesenteric artery blood flow between the former and the latter (408 +/- 142 vs. 389 +/- 32 ml/min). Spleen volume in idiopathic portal hypertension was six times that in chronic persistent hepatitis, and splenic artery blood flow showed a significant linear correlation with spleen volume in idiopathic portal hypertension (r = 0.71, p less than 0.02). The sum of splenic artery blood flow and superior mesenteric artery blood flow in idiopathic portal hypertension was 1195 +/- 294 ml/min, twice that in chronic persistent hepatitis (603 +/- 109 ml/min). Portal vascular resistance and intrahepatic portal vascular resistance were three times and four times those in chronic persistent hepatitis, respectively. These results indicate that both increased intrahepatic portal vascular resistance and increased splenic artery blood flow may play roles in the development of portal hypertension in idiopathic portal hypertension.\r"

Portal and splenic venous flows were significantly increased in the group order of the cirrhosis without splenomegaly group, the cirrhosis with splenomegaly group, and idiopathic portal hypertension group. Intrahepatic shunt index was significantly greater in the cirrhosis with splenomegaly group than in the cirrhosis without splenomegaly group, and it was negligible in the idiopathic portal hypertension group. Portal vein pressure was significantly elevated in the cirrhosis with splenomegaly group than in the cirrhosis without splenomegaly and idiopathic portal hypertension groups. Postsinusoidal resistances were significantly greater in the two groups of cirrhosis than in the idiopathic portal hypertension group, whereas presinusoidal resistance was significantly greater in the idiopathic portal hypertension group than in the two groups with cirrhosis. It is concluded that these differences are inconsistent with the view that cirrhosis with splenomegaly comes from idiopathic portal hypertension.\r"
