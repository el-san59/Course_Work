  ".W": "A 50-yr-old man with a history of 19 yr of work in the aluminum smelting industry, including 14 years in the potrooms, was found to have diffuse interstitial fibrosis, slightly more severe in the upper zones. He died of respiratory insufficiency 5 yr after initial presentation. Analysis of lung by electron optical techniques revealed 15,000,000,000 nonfibrous particles and 1,300,000,000 fibrous particles of aluminum oxide/g dry lung, values representing approximately a 1,000-fold increase over background exposure. The nonfibrous particles had a geometric mean diameter of 0.4 mu, and the fibers had a geometric mean length of 1.0 mu, a width of 0.06 mu, and an aspect ratio of 16. X-ray diffraction demonstrated alpha but not gamma aluminum oxide. These studies indicate that previous suggestions relating aluminum-induced fibrosis to the presence of gamma aluminum oxide are not correct. Although pulmonary fibrosis in this case may be a response to a very high total aluminum particle burden, the presence of large numbers of fibers raises the possibility that fibers play a role in aluminum fibrosis.\r"

In that case the cocaine was used intravenously, and death occurred within 3 h after the onset of symptoms. Here we describe a patient who developed acute pulmonary edema after smoking \"freebase\" cocaine. The pulmonary edema resolved spontaneously within 72 h. The cause of the acute reversible pulmonary edema was probably related to both pressure- and permeability-related changes.\r"

  ".W": "The pulmonary vascular effects of dopamine and of dobutamine have been reported variably in the literature. We investigated the effects of dopamine and of dobutamine, at doses of 10 and 20 micrograms/kg/min, on the relationships of overall mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) to cardiac index (Cl) in 14 dogs ventilated alternatively in hyperoxic (FIO2, 0.4) and in hypoxic (FIO2, 0.1) conditions. Five-point Ppa/Cl plots were constructed by opening an arteriovenous femoral fistula or by stepwise inflations of a balloon in the inferior vena cava. These Ppa/Cl plots were rectilinear in all experimental conditions. Hypoxia was associated with an increase in Ppa over the entire range of Cl studied (2 to 5 L/min/m2). A deterioration in arterial oxygenation and an increase in O2 consumption constantly occurred after dopamine as well as after dobutamine administration. At 10 micrograms/kg/min (n = 6 dogs) neither drug affected Ppa over the entire range of Cl at both 0.4 and 0.1 FIO2. At 20 micrograms/kg/min (n = 8 dogs), dopamine and dobutamine increased Ppa at the lowest Cl (2 to 4 and 2 to 3 L/min/m2, respectively) at 0.4 FIO2, and attenuated hypoxia-induced increases in Ppa over the entire range of Cl. Two repetitions of alternated 0.4 and 0.1 FIO2 exposures had no effect on Ppa/Cl plots in 6 additional dogs given no drug. We concluded that at dosages as great as 20 micrograms/kg/min, as generally given in clinical practice, dopamine and dobutamine exerted similar effects upon the pulmonary circulation of intact dogs; either no change or an increase in hyperoxic pulmonary vascular tone and either no change or an attenuation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary function during the early development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants is not well understood. Furthermore, it is not known how early airway reactivity appears in BPD. During a 14-month period we studied 32 infants (mean gestational age, 27.3 wk; mean birth weight, 1.02 kg) with respiratory distress syndrome in whom BPD eventually developed. We obtained maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves by manual inflation of the lung followed by forced deflation with a negative pressure on 64 occasions (mean postnatal age, 43.1 days). At each test MEFV curves were obtained in 3 conditions: baseline; after normal saline aerosolization with manual ventilation as a control; and after bronchodilator. Maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC (Vmax25) was markedly decreased at baseline and remained decreased after saline control. The FVC also was decreased in both baseline and saline control studies. After bronchodilator there was a marked (p less than 0.001) increase in Vmax25 (+214% above saline control) together with a significant (p less than 0.001) increase in FVC (+21%). Of 23 infants studied after 3 wk of postnatal age, 21 exhibited a more than 30% increase in Vmax25 above control (defined as airway reactivity). The remaining 2 infants were already receiving bronchodilator therapy. The most premature infant with demonstrable airway reactivity was 26 wk postconception, and the youngest was 12 days old. In 13 infants who were studied initially before 3 wk of age, there was a highly significant correlation (r = 0.91 p less than 0.001) between the degree of airway reactivity and the severity of respiratory disease as determined by the duration of ventilator dependence. Airway reactivity may play an important role in the development and severity of BPD.\r"

Previous studies suggest that a flow of air or application of cold solutions to the face, nasal mucosa, or pharynx may alter ventilation. We hypothesized that a flow of cold air directed against the cheek would reduce the sensation of breathlessness associated with loaded breathing. Sixteen subjects breathed on a device with an inspiratory resistive load (63 cm H2O/L/s) while PCO2 was maintained at 55 torr for 5 min. All studies were performed 4 times with each subject, twice with cold air directed against the cheek (4 degrees to 10 degrees C, 4 km/h) and twice with no flow on the subject. Subjects were asked to rate their breathlessness using a modified Borg scale. Cold air directed on the face reduced breathlessness induced by an inspiratory resistive load and hypercapnia (6.2 +/- 1.7 Borg scale units with no flow, 5.1 +/- 1.7 with cold air; p less than 0.002) without causing a significant reduction in ventilation. This effect was not observed when cold air was directed to the leg and does not appear to be associated with a reduction in the ventilatory response to hypercapnia or with initiation of the diving reflex. We conclude that cold air directed against the cheek significantly reduces dyspnea associated with the combination of hypercapnia and an inspiratory resistive load.\r"

In 1,905 subjects with complete data on age, sex, area of residence, smoking habits, and respiratory symptom prevalence, airway responsiveness was assessed by a histamine challenge test. Subjects with a decrease in FEV1 of greater than or equal to 10% at a histamine concentration of less than or equal to 16 mg/ml were considered to be responders. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness appeared to be age dependent, with the proportion of responders increasing from 13% in those 14 to 24 yr of age to 40% in those 55 to 64 yr of age (p less than 0.001). Respiratory symptom outcomes included chronic cough, chronic phlegm, dyspnea, bronchitic episodes, persistent wheeze, and asthmatic attacks. Respiratory symptom prevalence rates were significantly higher in responders (p less than 0.001 for all symptoms). Cigarette smoking is known to be related to respiratory symptom prevalence and possibly to bronchial responsiveness. Because of these associations, we examined the relationship of bronchial responsiveness to respiratory symptoms within cigarette smoking categories. For all respiratory symptoms, it was found that, regardless of smoking category, responders were more likely to be symptomatic than were nonresponders. Odds ratios ranged from 1.7 for chronic cough to 4.4 for asthmatic attacks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was an average of 8.8 yr of follow-up, with a maximum of 12. The method used was shown to be robust for span of follow-up from 3 to 12 yr (3 to 7 observations), and the results were verified by standard statistical methods. The standard error of the estimate decreased linearly with follow-up, indicating the need for longitudinal evaluation. Respiratory symptoms and diagnoses had the biggest negative impact on growth of lung function, using FVC, FEV1, Vmax50, and size-compensated flows (Vmax50/FVC). Smoking had the next biggest negative impact. Smoking cessation was shown to have a positive impact on growth of pulmonary function. Using a second linear model to adjust for individual variability and the random variability over surveys, individual growth showed similar trends. Further negative impacts were due to parental smoking, especially as it interacts with active smoking and respiratory disease. Flows at end of follow-up (Vmax50, Vmax50/FVC) were more sensitive than FEV1 to the effects of concurrent disease and smoking, and more persistent effects of these factors in early adulthood.\r"

One mg of subcutaneously administered histamine caused RL to increase by an average of more than 250% and Cdyn to fall on average to 26% of baseline; mean RL remained more than twice baseline, and mean Cdyn remained less than half baseline for 80 min. Intravenously administered nifedipine 3 micrograms/kg and ethanol (diluent) administered 25 min after histamine had no effect on RL but caused a slightly greater fall in Cdyn than in the control animals treated with histamine alone. Nifedipine 30 micrograms/kg, however, exhibited significant bronchodilator activity: 35 min after nifedipine 30 micrograms/kg, RL decreased on average to 41 +/- 17% above baseline (p less than 0.02), and Cdyn increased to 49 +/- 5% below baseline (p less than 0.0001). By comparison, isoproterenol (0.3 to 3.0 micrograms/kg) caused bronchodilation of more rapid onset (within 1 min) and shorter duration of action (approximately 10 min). Thus, we were able to demonstrate bronchodilator activity of nifedipine in vivo, as had been predicted by in vitro studies of guinea pig and human tracheal strips. These results would appear to justify continued exploration of the potential role for calcium channel blockers in the treatment of obstructive lung disease.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the acute physiologic effects of removing oxygen from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are receiving long-term oxygen therapy, we made serial measurements in 20 patients during and after stopping low-flow oxygen therapy. Removing oxygen caused an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, requiring 2 to 3 h to reach a new steady state. Removing oxygen therapy increased pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) by 31% during rest (8.14 +/- 0.61 versus 6.23 +/- 0.51 units, p less than 0.001) and by 29% during exercise (8.11 +/- 0.9 versus 6.31 +/- 0.7, p less than 0.001). The increase in PVRI occurred because of an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure without a change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or cardiac index. At rest the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure caused by stopping oxygen correlated with the decrease in arterial oxygen saturation (r = 0.70, p less than 0.01). Removing oxygen decreased stroke volume index during rest and exercise. Although removing oxygen increased pulmonary vascular resistance, it did not affect systemic arterial pressure or vascular resistance. Stopping oxygen reduced arterial and mixed venous oxygen tension and oxygen delivery during rest and exercise. In patients who had a normal PaCO2 while breathing room air, removing oxygen therapy increased their oxygen consumption; conversely, in those patients who had an elevated PaCO2 while breathing room air, stopping oxygen therapy reduced oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Such sequestration may be a critical initiating event in the generation of microvascular injury, although the mechanisms that lead to this localization are not understood. To investigate these phenomena, the following study employed intravenous pulses of 111Indium-tropolonate-labeled neutrophils (111In-neutrophils), which circulated in the rabbit with normal kinetics and responded in a manner indistinguishable from unlabeled, circulating neutrophils in response to an intravenous injection of purified endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or epinephrine. Pulmonary sequestration of 111In-neutrophils was assessed by quantitative external gamma camera scintigraphy of a lung suprahilar region of interest. Noninvasive assessment of radioactivity by this method accurately reflected total lung radioactivity, which was shown by autoradiography to be confined to the injected 111In-neutrophils. Intravenously administered LPS caused a marked, dose-dependent sequestration of 111In-neutrophils in the pulmonary vasculature, and exhaustive ultrastructural autoradiography showed discretely radiolabeled neutrophils located within pulmonary capillaries. A distinct effect was seen with an intravenous injection of as little as 100 ng per rabbit (i.e., 500 pg/ml blood). A 5-min ex vivo pretreatment of 111In-neutrophils with 10 ng to 10 micrograms/ml LPS in heat-inactivated plasma (which resulted in retention of as little as 500 pg LPS per 10(7) neutrophils) also caused dose-dependent pulmonary sequestration of the pretreated 111In-neutrophils but did not cause generalized neutropenia in recipient rabbits. There was no evidence of complement activation on the surface of pretreated neutrophils.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Before transfusion (Hgb, 10.8 g/dl), the patients had reduced peak oxygen consumption for body weight (by 25%, p less than 0.002) in comparison with 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects (Hgb, 13.8 g/dl). The ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide was significantly reduced at all work rates, and end-tidal PCO2 was abnormally high (46.3 versus 40.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), but ventilatory reserve, as estimated from pulmonary function tests, was normal. Both heart rate and cardiac output (as estimated by the indirect Fick method) were abnormally high during exercise; at an oxygen consumption of 19 ml/min/kg, heart rate was 13% higher (p less than 0.01) and, at 16 ml/min/kg, cardiac output was 28% higher (p less than 0.001) in the patients than in the control subjects. Nine patients were retested 3 to 8 days after transfusion (Hgb, 13.0 g/dl, p50, 26.4 mm Hg). Neither ventilatory nor circulatory abnormalities improved significantly. In patients 12 to 22 yr of age in stable condition with thalassemia major, we conclude: cardiac output, estimated by the CO2 rebreathing method, is high and arteriovenous O2 extraction is low during exercise; the high cardiac output during exercise is associated with hypoventilation; the high cardiac output is independent of short-term changes in hemoglobin concentration associated with transfusion.\r"

  ".W": "During exercise, ATP is converted to ADP and AMP to supply energy for muscular contraction. It is then regenerated via various pathways of intermediary metabolism. However, with high levels of exercise, net ATP degradation in muscle occurs. In exercise and other clinical situations, adenine nucleotide degradation leads to an accumulation of degradative purine products including hypoxanthine. In an effort to monitor events of energy metabolism, we examined plasma hypoxanthine levels at various exercise intensities. Peak plasma hypoxanthine levels after maximal exercise (18.9 +/- 2.6 microM, mean +/- SEM) were significantly greater than resting levels (1.1 +/- 0.1 microM; p less than 0.001). Hypoxanthine levels after steady state exercise at 52, 76, and 97% of ventilatory threshold did not exceed resting levels. However, plasma hypoxanthine rose significantly after exercise at 124% of ventilatory threshold (6.3 +/- 1.0 microM; p less than 0.01) and at 152% of ventilatory threshold (17.0 +/- 3.6 microM; p less than 0.001). Exercise at subventilatory threshold intensity (74% of ventilatory threshold) for a prolonged time period, such that total work equaled that performed at 152% of ventilatory threshold, did not elevate hypoxanthine levels (0.46 +/- 0.1 microM) above resting values. We conclude that elevation of plasma hypoxanthine levels occur during exercise at intensities that exceed the ventilatory threshold and indicate that net adenine nucleotide degradation has occurred.\r"

Five patients had straight ileoanal anastomosis while 18 had the construction of a J-pouch. A two-team approach was used for simultaneous abdominal and perineal procedures to facilitate a shortened operating time. A loop ileostomy was routinely used in the postoperative period and was closed an average of 4.5 months (range: 2-16 months) later without complication. Prolonged preoperative hospitalization was rarely necessary and outpatient steroid enema preparation was routinely used. There were no deaths. Nineteen patients with functioning pull-through procedures have been followed an average of 23 months (range: 3-42 months). Two other patients have not had ileostomy closure because of complications. The two remaining patients had intractable diarrhea and have since undergone conversion to a permanent ileostomy. The 19 patients are continent, having three to nine bowel movements each day. Nearly all wear a perineal sanitary pad because of rare, unpredictable leakage of small amounts of fluid, especially at night. Complications were significant in this group of patients. Intestinal obstruction was a frequent problem, occurring in 52 per cent of the entire series and necessitating reoperation in 22 per cent. Anal stricture was a problem in another five patients. A variety of other minor problems occurred and most were treated nonoperatively. In spite of moderate diarrhea and occasional leakage of stool, all patients with functioning pull-through procedures prefer their current status to life with an ileostomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of sucralfate (SC) in reducing NSAID-induced ulceration in a rat model. Nine groups of 20 rats each were segregated by drug(s) tested. Two NSAIDs, aspirin (ASA) and indomethacin (IND), were tested. Control groups consisted of saline only, ASA only, and IND only. SC was tested against ASA and IND separately, being administered 5 minutes preceding, mixed with, or 5 minutes following each NSAID. Administration of SC before ASA resulted in a reduction of mean ulcers per rat from 10.4 +/- 4.3 to 1.1 +/- 1.3 (P less than or equal to .0001). Administration of SC prior to IND resulted in a reduction of mean ulcer rate from 6.6 +/- 5.4 to 3.0 +/- 3.3 (P less than or equal to .02). When SC was given with IND or following it, no reduction in ulcer rate was observed. When SC was given with ASA or following it, the ulcer rate was reduced to 5.3 +/- 3.0 (P less than or equal to .002). It is concluded that SC is effective in reducing NSAID-induced ulcer production especially when administered before NSAID ingestion.\r"

Less appreciated is the improvement of vocal cord function after resection of a thyroid or parathyroid tumor. Over the last 22 years, 14 patients presented with vocal cord paresis in the presence of thyroid or parathyroid tumors. Of these 14 patients, nine had complete resolution of paresis following resection of the thyroid or parathyroid tumors: three had a thyroid carcinoma impinging upon the nerve, three had large colloid goiters, two had a follicular adenoma and one had a parathyroid adenoma displacing the nerve. In five of the 14 patients the vocal cord paralysis persisted after operation. In three, the pathology accounted for the vocal cord paralysis and was not amenable to operative improvement: one patient had an unresectable anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, one patient had long-standing idiopathic unilateral vocal cord paralysis, and one patient had laryngeal adenoid cystic carcinoma with thyroid invasion. The fourth patient had an extensive thyroid hemangioma. The paralysis persisted after resection. The fifth patient had long-standing idiopathic vocal cord palsy. A preoperative vocal cord paresis in a patient with thyroid or parathyroid disease does not indicate permanent loss of recurrent nerve function, even in the presence of carcinoma. In this series, vocal cord function was restored in 9 of 10 patients with resectable thyroid or parathyroid tumors.\r"

Retrospective analysis of all patients admitted to University Hospitals of Cleveland with malignant biliary obstruction was thus undertaken to identify the incidence, origin, management, and outcome of these metastatic tumors. During a 5-year period, 56 patients with jaundice secondary to biliary, pancreatic, ampullary, or metastatic tumors were identified. Of these, 12 (21%) represented a distant malignant process metastatic to the porta hepatis. Sites of origin were diverse: lymphoma, 2; breast, 3; colon, 2; and 1 each with Hodgkin's, lung, ovary endometrium, and melanoma. Patients ranged in age from 31 to 90 years (mean: 60). Surgical intervention was undertaken in only two patients (cholecystojejunostomy, 1; transhepatic U-tube stenting, 1). The remainder were managed as follows: no procedure, 3 (25%); percutaneous stenting, 5 (42%); and radiation only, 2 (17%). Mortality was as follows: 5 of 12 (42%) died within 30 days and 8 of 12 (67%) within 60 days. The only survivors beyond 60 days were the patients with Hodgkin's (1 of 1), lymphoma (1 of 2), breast (1 of 3) and melanoma (1 of 1). Ten of the patients had obvious extensive metastatic disease, which would explain the poor outcome. Analysis of this data indicates that overall survival is dismal and palliative, nonoperative methods to manage the jaundice should be considered.\r"

The immune response to tetanus toxoid was tested in the postoperative period. Besides the administration of blood, crystalloid solution, and plasma for coagulation factor deficiency, 42 patients also received methyl-prednisolone 1 g during additional resuscitation followed by an average of 15 mg/kg given daily for the next 2 days. The total dose of methylprednisolone averaged 3.9 g. The two groups of patients were similar for resuscitation needs and for insult. The immune response to tetanus toxoid was not significantly different between the two groups of patients. These data show that a short-term bolus of massive steroids does not appear to alter, significantly, the immune mechanism following severe hemorrhagic shock.\r"

Group 2 had a higher incidence of concomitant medical illnesses. Indications for operation were predominantly of an emergent nature in Group 2, with a marked decline in elective surgeries from 75 per cent to 55 per cent. There was a 15 per cent incidence of nonsurgical complications in Group 2, as opposed to 9 per cent in Group 1. This study demonstrates that the use of H2 blockers and changes in patient characteristics have altered the surgical treatment and outcome of patients with PUD.\r"

Most physicians now use \"clinical judgment\" to mitigate the frequency of chest x-ray. To determine the usefulness of \"selective\" preoperative chest x-ray studies, 403 consecutive patients undergoing operation were prospectively studied. Chest x-ray films were analyzed both for abnormality and the frequency with which the changes seen on x-ray films led to cancellation of surgery or resulted in a further evaluation of the pathology discovered. There were 228 male and 175 female patients, (average age: 54 years). A total of 166 (41%) patients had operations performed without a preoperative chest x-ray study. The x-ray studies on 136 of the 237 patients who had preoperative chest x-ray were considered normal. A variety of abnormalities such as effusion, cardiomegaly, atelectasis, or granuloma were found in the remaining 101 patients. Sixty-four of these patients were known from previous studies to have the abnormality that was recorded. Eight of 37 (21%), who had surgery as scheduled, subsequently underwent evaluation for the new pulmonary problem detected on x-ray films. Only two operations were cancelled as a result of the screening x-ray. The majority of abnormalities detected were already known or were considered insufficient for further evaluation. In a metropolitan area of Michigan the cost for a chest x-ray is $70. Projected nationwide, more than $1 billion could be saved on needless \"selective\" preoperative chest x-ray studies each year. These data suggest that preoperative chest x-ray is still widely overused.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighty-three (74%) of the injuries were caused by gunshot wounds, 18 (16%) by stab wounds, and 11 (10%) by blunt trauma. Of 102 patients who had a urinalysis (U/A) in the Emergency Department (ED), 12 had a normal U/A. Five of these 12 patients had severe renal pedicle injuries.

The incidence of shock was 38 per cent in patients with injuries not requiring renal explorations, 69 per cent in patients with renal parenchymal injuries requiring surgery, and 93 per cent in patients with pedicle injuries requiring repair or nephrectomy. Although it is generally believed that traumatic perirenal hematomas should not be explored, there was an increased incidence of complications with this approach in this series. Of 65 stable renal injuries treated conservatively (without exploration of the renal parenchyma), there were nine (14%) complications including three reoperation for missed injuries and three perinephric abscesses. In 46 injuries that were explored (38 for bleeding and eight without bleeding), there were only two complications (5%), including a perinephric abscess.\r"

Operative mortality was 7 per cent and morbidity occurred in 12 per cent of the patients. Symptomatic improvement was measured by relief of pain and sepsis and decrease of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase to normal. Overall improvement was seen in 73 per cent of patients (CCE 50%, CDD 8%, CDJ 65%), 27 per cent of the patients did not improve (CCE 50%, CDD 12%, CDJ 35%), 83 per cent of the poor results were in patients with advanced malignancy. Thirty-one per cent of patients undergoing CCE required conversion to CDD or CDJ. Cholecystoduodenostomy was associated with failure in 50 per cent of patients. CCD and CDJ are safe and reliable means of relieving distal common duct obstruction due to biliary or pancreatic disease. Cholecystojejunostomy may be performed in the terminal patient with advanced carcinoma requiring a short-term biliary bypass.\r"

Of the remaining 359 women, 75.3 per cent had some element of fibrocystic disease. Patients who had breast cancer were evaluated during their initial visit to the BCC by a nurse, general surgeon, radiation therapist, and oncologist. Ninety-five per cent of all patients were given a definitive treatment plan or a second opinion at the conclusion of their one visit to the center. Patient and physician satisfaction with the center concept has been high. The center emphasizes patient education and choice between mastectomy and breast-sparing procedures and radiation therapy for the control of primary cancers. Adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy is given to all nodal-positive patients. Establishment of multidisciplinary centers, such as the BCC, requires the commitment of all physician specialty groups, nursing and hospital administration. High quality patient care can be provided in such centers in a more efficient and coordinated manner than in the non-center setting. The center can serve as a source of increased patient referrals and research opportunities.\r"

Gallstone ileus still carries a mortality rate of five to ten times that of all other nonmalignant mechanical small bowel obstructions. Anticipated improvements related to augmented preoperative diagnostic yields shortened preoperative delays, and selective surgical management have not been substantiated. Improved mortality rates may await refinements in resuscitation, monitoring, and surgical skills.\r"

This disease was frequently an incidental finding during unrelated elective surgery and was often associated with other primary malignancies. Surgical treatment included appendectomy, right hemicolectomy, and interval hemicolectomy after initial appendectomy. Improved survival was noted in patients who had localized and noninvasive disease. Prognosis was most closely related to tumor grade. No patient who had localized, well-differentiated tumor died from the disease or had evidence of tumor recurrence after surgical treatment. All patients with poorly differentiated tumors died from widespread carcinomatosis. Appendectomy appears to be sufficient treatment for well-differentiated, localized, mucus secreting adenocarcinomas of the appendix.\r"

Among 161 patients with the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma, 61 (38%) had coexistent Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In comparison, among 161 sex- and age-matched patients with colloid nodules in the same population, 18 (11%) had Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Furthermore, in the series as a whole, the incidence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 423 patients with colloid nodules was 10 per cent. From the perspective of the Hashimoto's thyroiditis population in the same series of 800 thyroidectomies, among 267 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis 61 (23%) had coexistent carcinoma. In comparison, among 267 age- and sex-matched patients with colloid nodules there were only ten coexistent carcinomas for an incidence of 4 per cent. The high incidence of carcinoma of the thyroid in Hashimoto's thyroiditis lends credence to the hypothesis that Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a predisposing factor in the development of thyroid carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effect of previous arterial reconstruction at the femoral level on the outcome of femorofemoral bypass, 63 male patients who were operated upon from 1977 to 1985 were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty-four patients had no previous surgery (Group A) and 29 had had previous femoral-level surgery (Group B). Both groups were comparable for risk factors and indications for operation. Previous reconstructions included 36 inflow and 24 outflow procedures. Operatively, recipient profundaplasty was required in 79 per cent of Group B versus 32 per cent in Group A. Early results (fewer than 30 days) were comparable for mortality, graft thrombosis, and amputation. Late results showed similar graft thrombosis and cumulative patency rates. The need for reoperation (32 vs 9%) and major amputation (14.8 vs 3%) were increased in Group B but not significantly different. Primary and secondary femorofemoral bypass are both efficacious with the outcome determined by the progression of distal atherosclerosis.\r"

Mortality is frequent, and recurrent abscesses after operative drainage are common. Death often results from ongoing uncontrolled sepsis. The role of percutaneous drainage (PCD) of pancreatic abscesses is controversial. Recent experience with five patients who had pancreatic abscess and in whom a combination of operative drainage and PCD proved instrumental in survival leads the authors to recommend the consideration of both forms of drainage dependent upon the circumstances. Specifically, indications for PCD may include the following: use as a temporizing measure prior to celiotomy in a critically ill patient; use in postoperative patients who have recurrent abscesses and in whom the presence of dense inflammation precludes safe evacuation of pus; and use in the patient who has known portal hypertension and in whom massive bleeding is likely to result from celiotomy and abscess drainage.\r"

The author presents a detailed and fully illustrated description of the technique of PGV-AP performed during the last 14 years on 335 patients. An ulcer recurrence rate of 1.8 per cent was noted. The excellent results are attributed to the preservation of the sympathetic innervation to the stomach. These clinical findings confirm recent experimental studies that have demonstrated an inhibitory function of the sympathetic nervous system against gastric acid secretion.\r"

The absence of prolonged spontaneous or electrically induced atrial fibrillation was also documented in all patients. Three pulse generators were patient activated (nonautomatic) and two were multiprogrammable and automatic. The atrial pacemakers terminated many attacks of paroxysmal atrial flutter safely and reliably in a follow-up period ranging from 24 to 60 months (average, 42). No major complications developed. In four patients, concomitant drug therapy was necessary, although to a lesser degree, to reduce the frequency of attacks and the ventricular rate. Our study documents the long-term efficacy and low risk associated with permanent-burst atrial pacing in the treatment of drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial flutter in selected patients.\r"

Women had a higher resting heart rate, cardiac index, and pulse pressure and lower total peripheral resistance (all p less than 0.01) than men with the same pressure level. Isometric stress caused an increase in arterial pressure that was almost 50% higher in men than in women. The sexual difference in cardiovascular findings was significant before but not after menopause. For any level of arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance (and therefore the risk of hypertensive cardiovascular disease) was lower in women than in men. We conclude that premenopausal women are hemodynamically younger than men of the same chronologic age. Our study identifies a pathophysiologic mechanism for the clinical and epidemiologic finding that essential hypertension is less lethal in women than in men.\r"

Thirty-five patients with adverse drug reaction were identified among more than 300 patients evaluated for cognitive impairment and compared with patients without adverse drug reaction. Sedative hypnotic agents, especially long-acting benzodiazepines, were the commonest drugs associated with cognitive impairment in this population. The number of drugs used, use of sedative hypnotics and antihypertensives, and falling were strongly associated with adverse reactions in logistic regression analyses. The relative odds of an adverse reaction associated with cognitive impairment increased as the number of prescription drugs increased, exceeding 9.0 for patients taking four or more prescription drugs. Adverse drug reactions are an important source of excess morbidity in patients with dementia or suspected dementia. Strategies that could minimize this problem include a high index of suspicion, drug-free trials in suspected cases, and careful monitoring of drug therapy.\r"

Multiple regression analysis identified number of cigarettes smoked daily, use of stoves for heat, and concurrently symptomatic cohabitants as significant predictors of carboxyhemoglobin level (F = 13.939 [3, 85]; p less than 0.01). Obtaining carboxyhemoglobin levels from patients who used stoves for heat or had similarly affected cohabitants identified 4 of 4 patients with levels greater than 10% (sensitivity, 100%) and excluded 47 of 85 patients with lower levels (specificity, 55.3%).

Five patients received low doses immediately after the conventional doses (group 2). Six patients were treated with low doses from the outset (group 3). In group 1, similar responses to either dose were seen in 9 patients, whereas there were better responses to conventional doses in 3 and to the lower dose in 1. All patients in group 2 maintained remissions with low doses. There were two excellent-good responses, one fair, and three poor responses in group 3. Side effects were generally less frequent and severe with the low doses. Low-dose danazol is better tolerated but took longer to obtain remissions, and is useful for maintenance therapy in the management of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\r"

Nevertheless, the omission of this procedure may lead to the inadequate visualization of the fundus for screening. We administered a topical solution of 1% tropicamide to 30 adults to determine the course of pupillary dilation over time and whether adequate dilation could be attained within a routine clinic visit. Pupil diameters were measured every 5 minutes in a 30-minute period. The initial mean pupillary diameter was 2.4 mm and the endpoint was 5.5. Dilation was significantly slower in those older than 50 years of age. However, at 15 minutes 87% of the patients, regardless of age, had achieved dilation to at least 4 mm, which should be sufficient for screening under most circumstances. We conclude that adequate pupillary dilation in adults usually can be achieved within the time frame of a routine office visit and thus should not be a deterrent to routine funduscopic screening by primary care practitioners.\r"

Entered into the registry were 187 patients with a mean age (+/- SD) of 36 +/- 15 years (range, 1 to 81), and a female-to-male ratio of 1.7:1 overall. The mean interval from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 2 years. The most frequent presenting symptoms included dyspnea (60%), fatigue (19%), and syncope (or near syncope) (13%). Raynaud phenomenon was present in 10% (95% of whom were female) and a positive antinuclear antibody test, in 29% (69% female). Pulmonary function studies showed mild restriction (forced vital capacity [FVC], 82% of predicted) with a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and hypoxemia with hypocapnia. The mean (+/- SD) right atrial pressure was 9.7 +/- 6 mm Hg; mean pulmonary artery pressure, 60 +/- 18 mm Hg; cardiac index, 2.3 +/- 0.9 L/min X m2; and pulmonary vascular resistance index, 26 +/- 14 mm Hg/L/min X m2 for the group. Although no deaths or sustained morbid events occurred during the diagnostic evaluation of the patients, the typically long interval from initial symptoms to diagnosis emphasizes the need to develop strategies to make the diagnosis earlier.\r"

Aspects of these current practices, however, may limit their effectiveness. We propose the use of body substance isolation, a simpler alternative system that is used for all patients, not just in response to a specific diagnosis, and that emphasizes the increased use of barrier precautions, especially gloving, when contact with potentially infectious bodily secretions is anticipated. Because of its rationale and simplicity, body substance isolation has been enthusiastically accepted at our hospitals, and we encourage others to consider and evaluate this approach.\r"

Approximately 25 axial scans, parallel to the floor of the anterior cranial fossa, were performed on each subject; four to five coronal CT scans were also added. Further data were supplemented by examinations of 62 patients affected by nonneoplastic disease of the paranasal sinuses. Microsurgery is replacing classic macrosurgery in the treatment of nonneoplastic disease of the paranasal sinuses. This new trend requires a perfect preoperative delineation of the anatomy. For this purpose, the present paper contains a list of 10 questions which can be answered exhaustively by computed tomography on the basis of the data illustrated. The answers cover most requirements of sinus microsurgery.\r"

The results indicated that the more difficult the listening condition, the greater the advantage provided by the ASP instrument. The ASP hearing aid may prove to be beneficial to many hearing-impaired individuals who have difficulty communicating in noisy situations.\r"

Tympanometry was normal in all patients, but acoustic reflex was elevated or absent in seven of 12 patients with hearing loss. Analysis of the data revealed a significant association between sensorineural hearing loss and the homozygous sickle cell disease, and a significant association between hearing loss and early occurrence of vaso-occlusive crisis. This latter finding suggest that the microvasculature of the cochlea in young infants may be more susceptible to occlusion during sickle cell crisis.\r"

Esophageal speech is used by all surgeons in some of their patients. The introduction of tracheoesophageal puncture techniques for prosthetic placement has added a new dimension to speech rehabilitation and is used almost 30% of the time by those who use it (88% of surgeons surveyed). The proportional use of the most common methods of speech support is almost identical between head and neck surgeons of a general surgical background and otolaryngologists. The incidence of total failures to achieve voice rehabilitation is less than 10%.\r"

A steady decrease of recurrent cholesteatoma was found, however, in the second period of our surgical experience (1978 to 1982) when prevention techniques were adopted in all operations, resulting in a 1.07% incidence (four of 373 operated ears). Our present policy for prevention of recurrent cholesteatoma in intact canal wall tympanoplasties with mastoidectomy includes the use of plastic sheeting with thick Silastic, the repair of bony sulcus defects with cartilage shavings, staging of the operation with preplanned reexploration of the middle ear and mastoid, and transtympanic ventilation tube insertion in cases of refractory tubal insufficiency.\r"

A sufficiently broad range of stimulus variables was included to ensure that the auditory system was adequately sampled in order to demonstrate developmental principles. Findings indicate that there are no differences in wave V latency-intensity functions between infants and adults. For waves I, III, and V, absolute and interwave latency-repetition rate functions differ between infants and adults and undergo systematic changes throughout the first 6 months of life. The most dramatic ABR changes (between any two sequential test sessions in infants) occurred between the ages of newborn and 2 weeks, with less pronounced ABR changes beyond 2 weeks of age. The pattern of latency change for wave I was different from that for waves III and V. After 2 weeks of age, wave I latency was the same as the adult value at all repetition rates. In contrast, waves III and V were characterized by decreasing latency throughout the follow-up period. A curvilinear developmental model provided a satisfactory fit to ABR latency data.\r"

With the eyes deviated toward the lowermost ear, the observed nystagmus was rotatory-linear and the fast phases beat toward this ear. When the eyes were deviated to the opposite side, the fast phase of nystagmus was mainly upward linear-oblique. In a small number of patients, however, some unusual findings were observed: the nystagmus was the usual rotatory-linear, but the duration was much longer; or the nystagmus was purely horizontal; or the nystagmus was rotatory-linear, but the fast phases were in opposite direction to that usually observed. These data suggest that: the observed paroxysmal nystagmus seems compatible with excitation of the posterior or horizontal semicircular canal of the lowermost ear, or the superior canal of the uppermost ear; and singular nerve section is an appropriate treatment only if the observed paroxysmal nystagmus is compatible with excitation of a posterior semicircular canal.\r"

Osteochondrosis is an unusual disease process affecting large joints, particularly the knee. Rarely, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) may be affected. The disease process involves the synovial lining of the TMJ and is commonly ascribed to a benign neoplastic process or metaplasia, although trauma and inflammation have also been implicated. This process can result in single or multiple loose cartilage bodies (joint mice) within the joint cavity. Symptoms are usually those of a mass in the preauricular area, or those of TMJ dysfunction (pain, dislocation, click, decreased range of motion). Physical findings are limited to presence of a mass in the pre-auricular parotid area with a paucity of other parotid findings. Treatment involves removal of the loose cartilage bodies from the TMJ and possibly the synovial lining, if it appears to be severely damaged.\r"

One hundred four human temporal bones obtained from 81 individuals with congenital anomalies in the ear and/or other parts of the body, with ages ranging from 24 weeks' gestation to 35 years, were processed histologically, stained with H & E, and examined under the light microscope. The slides were projected under a microprojector, and the mesenchyme remaining in each of 19 portions of the middle ear cleft was measured by compensating polar planimetry and expressed as a percentage of the total potential middle ear space in that histologic section. By comparing the findings in the present study with those of a previous study in which mesenchyme remaining in ears from normal age-matched controls was measured, we found that more mesenchyme remained for a longer time in the middle ear cavities of infants with congenital anomalies than in those of control infants (p less than .01). In addition, the amount of mesenchyme remaining was in direct proportion to the degree to which development of the middle ear was anomalous.\r"

In guinea pigs sensitized with egg albumin, antigen challenge not only evoked bronchospasms, but also induced some pathologic changes in the inner ear, especially in the stria vascularis. These findings lead to the inference that the inner ear may be affected by systemic immune responses in sensitized animals.\r"

In a companion study, multiunit spike counts were obtained from 3-week-old chickens before, during, and after consecutive tympanic membrane puncture, columella removal, and oval window puncture. Tympanic membrane puncture and columella removal (conductive hearing loss) are not associated with either cell area changes in the nucleus magnocellularis or changes in spontaneous neuronal activity.

We treated 5 patients with adrenoleukodystrophy (3 males and 2 symptomatic female carriers) for 6 months with a diet enriched in oleic acid (C18:1) and moderately restricted in C26:0. Elevated plasma and erythrocyte levels of C26:0 decreased in a time-dependent manner during treatment. Total plasma C26:0 concentration was lowered by 50 +/- 9% (p less than 0.01); it became normal in the female carriers. The total erythrocyte level of C26:0 decreased (44 +/- 5%; p less than 0.001) into the normal range in all patients. Significant decreases were noted in the saturated VLFA composition of plasma and erythrocyte sphingomyelin and erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine during dietary treatment. In general, decreases in saturated VLFA levels were accompanied by increases in monounsaturated VLFA levels, while total VLFA values did not change. This novel approach to the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy, in which there is an exchange of monounsaturated VLFA for the more toxic saturated VLFA, may prove clinically beneficial in this disorder.\r"

A number of studies have indicated that neurons from patients with Alzheimer's disease have decreased ribonucleic acid levels and reduced protein synthesis. Recent studies using lymphoblasts from patients with Alzheimer's disease have indicated that these cells are more sensitive to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-alkylating agents. We have used cell survival, unscheduled DNA synthesis, and alkaline elution to assess the capacity for DNA repair in skin fibroblasts from normal control subjects, control subjects with central nervous system disease, and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Our results indicate that the Alzheimer's disease cells, unlike normal cells, fail to repair methylmethane sulfonate-induced DNA damage. Both normal and Alzheimer's disease cells are able to ameliorate the effects of ultraviolet light. These results indicate that a specific pathway for DNA repair is affected in Alzheimer's disease. The repair defect may be related to the cause of the disease or may be the cause of the disease.\r"

It carries the principal cortical input to the hippocampal formation. Destruction of the perforant pathway in experimental animals leads to a partial deafferentation of its target neurons, followed by a robust sprouting of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) terminals in the deafferented perforant pathway zone. In Alzheimer's disease, the cells of origin of the perforant pathway are laden with neurofibrillary tangles. AChE staining in the terminal zone of the perforant pathway in Alzheimer's disease shows several distinct patterns that are not found in control brains. These changes are consistent with the results of experimental studies demonstrating reinnervation in laboratory mammals, including nonhuman primates. The results suggest that in Alzheimer's disease sprouting of AChE-containing systems occurs in the hippocampal formation in response to disease-related cellular damage in the entorhinal cortex.\r"

Visual field defects were the only neurological abnormality in 17 patients; the remainder had additional findings. Three patients had a major brainstem stroke. Stroke in the posterior cerebral artery territory was found in a heterogeneous group of patients, although embolism was the most common stroke mechanism. Several distinct patient groups were identified: cardiac source embolism (10 patients), vertebrobasilar atheroma with local embolism (6), migraine (5), systemic illness with presumed coagulopathy (3), and \"unknown source embolism\" after negative cardiac investigation (11 patients). During follow-up, 26 patients had no further neurological events (the majority on anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment), 3 suffered new strokes, and 6 died.\r"

Gadolinium enhancement of multiple sclerosis plaques correlated with the clinical activity of the disease and corresponded anatomically with the symptoms and signs. We conclude that gadolinium enhancement of magnetic resonance images is a promising tool in the investigation of multiple sclerosis lesions and that it may provide a method for objective follow-up in clinical trails.\r"

Twenty-mu-thick sections from the midfrontal, superior temporal, and inferior parietal areas were examined with an image-analysis apparatus with combined manual and automatic editing capacity. Neuroectodermal cells were counted, measured, and assigned to one of ten categories, which were later summarized in three: large neurons (greater than 90 mu 2), small neurons (41 to 90 mu 2), and glia (5 to 40 mu 2). Determinations were also made of brain weight, cortical thickness, neuronal density, neuron-glia ratio, and percentage of cell area. The results showed statistically significant age-related decrements in the following values: brain weight, cortical thickness in the midfrontal and superior temporal areas, large neurons in all three areas, and the neuron-glia ratio in the midfrontal and inferior parietal areas. The total number of neurons, neuronal density, and percentage of cell area were all unchanged. Increasing with age were the number of small neurons in the midfrontal cortex and glia in the midfrontal and superior temporal areas. The following conclusions were drawn: Aging affects the frontal and temporal lobes more than the parietal; the salient change is shrinkage of large neurons with consequently increasing numbers of small neurons; constant neuronal density coupled with diminished cortical volume (decreased brain weight and cortical thinning) indicate that there is some neuronal loss with age, but it is of much lesser magnitude than previously supposed; and the number of glia increases with age.\r"

Using a model of brain edema induced by cold-induced injury, we have demonstrated an early elevation of superoxide radicals followed by permeability changes in the blood-brain barrier and development of edema in injured brain. Intravenous injection of liposome-entrapped copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase 5 minutes before the injury-enhanced entry of the enzyme into endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier of injured brain reduced the brain level of superoxide radicals and ameliorated blood-brain barrier permeability changes and brain edema. Identical treatment 5 minutes after injury was also effective. These data demonstrate that superoxide radicals play an important role in the delayed development of vasogenic brain edema following brain injury.\r"

The location of the seizure focus was verified by depth electrode recordings in 2 patients and by lesions shown on computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging in the other 2. In each patient, MEG localization estimates were consistent with the location of the seizure focus shown by other methods. When seizures were recorded repeatedly and mapped with a single-channel magnetometer placed at different scalp locations in a single patient, the MEG localization agreed with the electrographic seizure focus localized from depth electrodes. In the maps, the MEG resolved an ambiguity in the scalp EEG and therefore increased the confidence of localization. MEG recordings of seizures may help localize epileptic foci noninvasively.\r"

Since then, certain tastes provoked flushing and sweating localized to the scarred areas, lasting for 10 to 15 minutes after a latency of a few seconds. The response was evoked most readily from the ipsilateral posterior section of the tongue and was virtually abolished by local administration of anesthesia to the tongue. It remained unaltered after blockade of the sphenopalatine and stellate ganglia but was diminished by blockade of the mandibular nerve. Thermoregulatory sweating and flushing were diminished in the scarred areas. Patchy destruction of sympathetic fibers, which are known to accompany peripheral trigeminal nerve branches, and reinnervation of the affected areas by parasympathetic fibers that normally mediate salivation may explain the phenomenon. It is thus analogous to the gustatory flushing and sweating that may follow damage to the auriculotemporal nerve in the region of the parotid gland (Frey's syndrome).\r"

Methods have been developed to detect this variant transthyretin in the serum, and to detect a base change in a mutated transthyretin gene. The biochemical and genetic abnormalities in transthyretin are completely linked to the clinical diagnosis of type I familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. These diagnostic methods may allow early diagnosis and genetic counseling to avoid transmission of this intractable disorder to the next generation.\r"

Clindamycin reduced mortality from 40% in normal mice and 100% in cortisone-treated mice to 0% in both groups. Although we were unable to document appreciable levels of clindamycin in the brains of infected mice, the histological features of cerebral infection were markedly altered. The formation of large numbers of cysts and the intense inflammatory response seen in the brains of normal mice and the unchecked infection and tissue necrosis in the brains of cortisone-treated mice were absent in the brains of clindamycin-treated mice. Enumeration of cysts in the brains of mice 10 weeks after infection revealed a significantly lower number in the clindamycin-treated mice. Spread of infection to other organs was also decreased during clindamycin administration. These observations suggest that clindamycin may have a role in the therapy of toxoplasmic encephalitis.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of a 5-day treatment with coumermycin A1 (hereafter referred to as coumermycin) (at three dosage regimens), with ciprofloxacin, or with coumermycin plus ciprofloxacin was tested in experimental aortic valve endocarditis induced in rats by a strain of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was compared with the efficacy of a 5-day treatment with cloxacillin plus gentamicin. While coumermycin was far less effective than cloxacillin plus gentamicin in reducing the bacterial counts in vegetations (P less than 10(-8), ciprofloxacin was as effective as cloxacillin plus gentamicin. Coumermycin plus ciprofloxacin was less effective than ciprofloxacin alone (P = 0.01). For endocarditis induced by two additional methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains, the high-dosage regimen of coumermycin (12 mg/kg every 12 h) had the same low efficacy. Coumermycin-resistant variants of S. aureus emerged in most of the vegetations during coumermycin treatment. The ciprofloxacin susceptibility of S. aureus was unchanged during ciprofloxacin treatment. The addition of ciprofloxacin to coumermycin in the treatment did not prevent the emergence of coumermycin-resistant variants. Twelve additional S. aureus strains isolated from the blood of patients with endocarditis were tested in vitro against coumermycin with precautions to avoid carry-over of the antibiotic. Coumermycin exhibited a bacteriostatic activity at very low concentrations (MIC, less than 0.004 microgram/ml) but only a weak bactericidal activity (MBC for 90% of strains, 8 micrograms/ml), a finding contrasting with that of others. Furthermore, coumermycin-resistant mutants could be selected in vitro from the 15 S. aureus strains tested. These results indicated no evidence in vivo of a synergistic activity of coumermycin and ciprofloxacin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The parent ribosyl analogs exhibited little antiviral selectivity owing to high cytotoxicity. In contrast, ara-tubercidin, ara-toyocamycin, ara-sangivamycin, and deoxysangivamycin exhibited selectivity between antiviral effect (measured by plaque or titer reduction or both) and cytotoxicity (measured microscopically and by incorporation of radioactive precursors into DNA, RNA, and protein). The selectivity (in vitro therapeutic indexes) for these four compounds ranged from 2 to 40. The two sangivamycin analogs were the most potent and selective. Ara-sangivamycin, for example, inhibited virus replication 10(5)-fold at a concentration (10 microM) which produced only partial inhibition of cell growth and labeled precursor incorporation. The four arabinosyl and deoxyribosyl nucleosides appeared to act by inhibition of viral DNA synthesis as quantitated by DNA-DNA dot blot hybridization. These four analogs also were tested for activity against two strains of type 1 herpes simplex virus by a plaque reduction assay. Unexpectedly, all compounds inhibited herpes simplex virus to a lesser extent than human cytomegalovirus.\r"

[3H]amikacin binding to renal membranes was found to be a rapid, saturable process with a fourfold greater affinity for basolateral membranes than for brush border membranes (Kd basolateral = 607 microM; Kd brush border = 2,535 microM). Renal membranes prepared from immature rats (2 to 3 weeks old) exhibited a significantly lower affinity compared with membranes from adults (Kd basolateral = 2,262 microM; Kd brush border = 6,216 microM). Additionally, the inhibitory behavior of several aminoglycosides versus [3H]amikacin binding to brush border membranes revealed the following rank order of potency: neomycin greater than tobramycin approximately gentamicin approximately netilmicin greater than amikacin approximately neamine greater than streptomycin. The relative insensitivity of immature rats to aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity in vivo and the comparative nephrotoxicity of the various aminoglycosides suggest that renal membrane-binding affinity is closely correlated to the nephrotoxic potential of these antibiotics.\r"

Six healthy subjects received the 3-mg/kg dose both intramuscularly (i.m.) and intravenously (i.v.) (1-h infusion). Uremic patients were given the 3-mg/kg dose as an i.m. injection, except for the hemodialysis patients, who received the dose as a 1-h i.v. infusion. After the i.m. injection, the peak concentrations in serum were higher and the times to peak levels were longer in patients with renal impairment than in healthy subjects. The elimination half-life in serum increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment, from 2 h in normal subjects to 32 h in patients with creatinine clearances of less than 10 ml/min. Renal impairment did not significantly modify the apparent volume of distribution. After the same 3-mg/kg dose as a 1-h i.v. infusion in six hemodialysis patients, the elimination half-life averaged 48 and 5 h off and on a 4- to 5-h hemodialysis session, respectively. The habekacin pharmacokinetic data appeared to be similar to those of the other available aminoglycoside antibiotics.\r"

The patients (mean age, 15.7 years) had previously received 2-week courses of tobramycin therapy, for a mean cumulative total of 279 days each. The cumulative tobramycin dose ranged from 632 to 7,644 mg/kg. The patients were studied before and at the end of a 2-week course of treatment with tobramycin (10 to 20 mg/kg per day) to discriminate between acute and chronic toxicity. In patients studied at the beginning of the present course of treatment, the glomerular filtration rate, measured as 24-h creatinine clearance, did not correlate with the cumulative dose of tobramycin received during previous courses. Eighteen patients (39%) had a reduced glomerular filtration rate compared with normal values (mean, 12.5% reduction) but normal serum creatinine values. Two patients (5%) had a high-frequency hearing deficit (above 8 kHz), but only one deficit was possibly related to tobramycin. No chronic vestibular toxicity was observed. During the course of treatment, no patients developed acute nephrotoxicity. After 2 weeks of treatment 32% had a slightly reduced hearing threshold (15 to 30 dB) in two or more high frequencies, and 28% had a fall in vestibular response greater than 25% of the initial value but remained within normal limits. Thus, the acute and chronic toxicity of repeated high-dose tobramycin treatment in cystic fibrosis patients seems to be very mild.\r"

After each 1.0-mg/kg (body weight) dose, serum was collected for 96 h, and complete 24-h urine collections were obtained for a total of 30 days. Two months of washout were required before crossover. Concentrations in serum and urine were measured by radioimmunoassay, and concentrations in serum and urinary excretion rates were simultaneously fitted to a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Netilmicin exhibited significantly lower total body clearance (48 versus 90 ml/min) and longer terminal elimination half-life (161 versus 96 h) than tobramycin. As a result of these pharmacokinetic differences, the predicted tissue accumulation of netilmicin at steady state was significantly higher than that of tobramycin (P less than 0.05). Relative rates of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity probably depend on both the differential tissue uptake (accumulation) and the concentration of the aminoglycoside which produces intracellular toxicity. Because the steady-state tissue accumulation of netilmicin is nearly 2.5 times greater than that of tobramycin, its potency in the production of intracellular toxicity needs to be that much less for the two agents to produce the same incidence of clinical nephrotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Vancomycin is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic that has concentration-dependent efficacy and toxicity. Recent literature indicates that orally administered activated charcoal can enhance the clearance of intravenously administered drugs. To evaluate the effects of activated charcoal on vancomycin clearance, six healthy male volunteers received vancomycin (1 g) intravenously with and without activated charcoal coadministration. In a randomized crossover sequence, subjects were given 50 g of activated charcoal immediately before the vancomycin infusion was begun and 15 g at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h afterwards, or an equal volume of water. Multiple doses of charcoal did not have a statistically significant effect on any pharmacokinetic parameter for vancomycin. Mean control values +/- standard deviation for vancomycin clearance, elimination half-life, and 24-h urinary recovery were 6.4 +/- 1.0 liters/h, 6.6 +/- 1.5 h, and 856 +/- 116 mg, respectively. Mean values for the same parameters were 6.4 +/- 1.0 liters/h, 6.0 +/- 0.9 h, and 897 +/- 130 mg when activated charcoal was given. We conclude that multiple doses of orally administered activated charcoal do not enhance vancomycin clearance in subjects with normal renal function when serum concentrations are within the therapeutic range. The results of this investigation cannot be extrapolated to patients with toxic vancomycin concentrations or renal dysfunction. The use of activated charcoal in these populations warrants further study.\r"

Four mutant strains, CR-1, CR-2, CR-3, and CR-4, were unable to methylate the oxygen at C5 of the macrolide moiety and produced essentially only the avermectin B components. These four strains lack avermectin B2 O-methyltransferase (B2OMT) activity. Two mutant strains were unable to methylate the oleandrose moiety at the oxygens at C3' and C3'' and produced essentially only demethylavermectin components. One of these mutants, strain CR-5 (derived from wild-type \"S. avermitilis\"), produced demethylavermectin A and B components and possessed normal B2OMT levels. The other mutant, strain CR-6 (derived from strain CR-1, which lacks B2OMT activity), produced only demethylavermectin B components. Reaction of 3\"-O-demethylavermectin B2a and S-adenosylmethionine with either cell extracts or purified B2OMT resulted in the methylation of the oxygen at C5 of the macrolide moiety and yielded only 3''-O-demethylavermectin A2a as the product. These experiments indicate that different enzymes are required for methylation of the macrolide (the oxygen at C5) and the oleandrose (oxygen at C3) and that methylation of the oleandrose occurs before attachment to the macrolide ring.\r"

Administration before virus infection was more effective than administration at the same time as virus infection. Although interferon administration had dramatic effects on the survival of animals, it did not have much effect on virus secretion in the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, the mechanism by which interferon reduces the susceptibility of animals to viral-bacterial synergy was postulated to be via its immunomodulatory effects.\r"

An inhibitory effect of penicillin G and of ampicillin was demonstrated, whereas chloramphenicol gave rise to an enhancement of the chemiluminescence response from polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These effects could be due to interaction between the drugs and the polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but they could also be the result of interference with the generation of light without any effect on the cells. Therefore, the effects of the same antimicrobial agents on the chemiluminescence generated from a cell-free system consisting of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide were investigated in parallel. The results obtained in the cell-free system were almost identical to those obtained in the cell system; i.e., penicillin G and ampicillin caused an inhibition and chloramphenicol caused an enhancement of the light emission. These results indicate that observed effects induced by drugs in a chemiluminescence assay are not necessarily due to interaction between the drug and polymorphonuclear leukocytes but may be caused by interference with other components of the assay. In view of these findings, the conflicting data reported in the literature on the effects of antimicrobial agents on phagocyte function are discussed.\r"

In contrast, a pronounced increase in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in the presence of 4-quinolones was observed in these studies. The uptake of [3H]thymidine into DNA (trichloroacetic acid precipitable) was significantly increased in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes when they were exposed to eight new 4-quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, A-56619, A-56620, amifloxacin, enoxacin, and pefloxacin, at 1.6 to 6.25 micrograms/ml for 5 days. Four less antibacterially active 4-quinolones (nalidixic acid, cinoxacin, flumequine, and pipemidic acid) stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation only at higher concentrations or not at all. Kinetic studies showed that incorporation of [3H]thymidine was not affected or slightly inhibited by ciprofloxacin 2 days after phytohemagglutinin stimulation but was increased on days 3 to 6. The total incorporation of [3H]thymidine from day 1 to day 6 after phytohemagglutinin stimulation was increased by 42 to 45% at 5 to 20 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml. Increased [3H]thymidine incorporation was also seen when human lymphocytes were stimulated with mitogens other than phytohemagglutinin. Ciprofloxacin added at the start of the culture had a more pronounced effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation than when added later. In spite of the apparent increase in DNA synthesis, lymphocyte growth was inhibited by 20 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml, and cell cycle analysis showed that ciprofloxacin inhibited progression through the cell cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several of the new 4-quinolones significantly increase the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA of mitogen-stimulated human lymphocytes. This study suggests that ciprofloxacin inhibits de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, thereby resulting in a compensatory increase in the uptake of pyrimidine precursors through salvage pathways, and that additional effects may affect eucaryotic cell growth. Incorporation of deoxyuridine, uridine, and orotic acid as well as thymidine was increased in the presence of ciprofloxacin, one of the antibacterially most active of the new 4-quinolones. In contrast, the uptake was decreased in very high concentrations of the drug. Culture in HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterine, thymidine) medium, which blocks de novo thymidylate synthesis, abrogated the increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin also failed to increase the uptake of [14C]hypoxanthine or leucine, indicating a selective effect on pyrimidine and not on purine nucleotide biosynthesis. N-(Phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate, an inhibitor of pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, also increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes in a fashion similar to ciprofloxacin. The growth of several cell lines was partially inhibited by ciprofloxacin at 20 micrograms/ml and completely inhibited at 80 to 160 micrograms/ml. Growth inhibition by ciprofloxacin could not be restored by the addition of uridine to the medium. Chromosome breaks, gene amplification, or other genetic alterations could not be detected in human lymphocytes incubated with up to 25 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml.\r"

Serial blood samples were collected from individual animals, and plasma was analyzed for intact cefepime by a high-pressure liquid chromatography-UV method. Assay results were evaluated by compartmental and noncompartmental methods to characterize pharmacokinetics for each species and dosage regimen. For intravenous (i.v.) bolus administration of 28 to 386 mg/kg (body weight) to rats, total body clearance (CL; 11.0 ml/min per kg) was essentially invariant with the dose; however, the terminal half-life (t1/2) and the steady-state distribution volume (Vss) increased with increasing dose level. After administration of 87 to 1,502 mg/kg by i.v. infusion, CL (12.5 ml/min per kg) was again similar for all dose groups. Mean t1/2 values (1.3 to 4.6 h) appeared unusually long for a cephalosporin in rats, and inordinately variable. No consistent differences among dose group mean Vss values were found. The maximal concentration of drug in plasma at the end of infusion was not a linear function of dose. For the cynomolgus monkey, kinetic parameters for 5-min i.v. infusions were linearly related to dose over the range of 10 to 600 mg/kg. Mean parameter values were t1/2 = 1.7 h, CL = 1.6 ml/min per kg, and Vss = 0.21 liters/kg. The pharmacokinetic results indicate substantive differences between the two species with respect to their response to toxicologic doses of cefepime.\r"

Its activity was compared with those of benzylpenicillin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, fusidic acid, and bacitracin. FCE 22101 and imipenem (MIC, less than or equal to 0.5 mg/liter) were the most active agents against the anaerobic strains tested, except against Clostridium difficile strains. On the basis of these results, FCE 22101 appears to be a promising antimicrobial agent for treatment of anaerobic infections, and further clinical investigations are indicated.\r"

Pustules were prone to develop during the summer months in hirsute patients, in patients with hyperhidrosis, and in patients in whom topical treatment of a more occlusive nature was applied. The male-female ratio was 4.8:1. Topical antibiotic treatment of these pustules in psoriatic patients appeared to be unwarranted since the lesions resolved when topical therapy was discontinued.

Follow-up data are presented in 29 patients who completed an initial course of PUVA given two to three times weekly. A complete clinical response was observed in ten patients with plaque-type MF and seven with erythroderma without Sezary syndrome. The PUVA therapy was palliative for patients with advanced disease, in combination with other therapies. The mean observation period was approximately five years. Despite maintenance PUVA, most patients relapsed between ten and twenty months and were treated with another intensive course.

The SCC-RAG titers were significantly high in three patients with invasive SCC in whom primary tumors were either comparatively large or were associated with metastatic lesions, while they remained within the normal limit in patients with smaller-sized, nonmetastatic SCC, Bowen's disease, other non-SCC dermatoses, and in normal control subjects. The SCC-RAG titers, therefore, provided a useful tumor marker for cutaneous SCC, particularly in advanced stages. In such cases, the values were clearly correlated with tumor behaviors in response to or against treatments and with the development of metastasis.\r"

In seven cases, the dysplastic precursor was lentiginous, while a superficial spreading pattern was present in one. Initial surgery was often inadequate because of the difficulty in defining tumor margins and the lack of pigment. In seven of the tumors, S100 protein was demonstrated within the invasive spindle cell component by the immunoperoxidase method. This finding was negative in three cases, two of which showed positive staining of the precursor and nerve filaments, indicating that the absence of S100 protein cannot be used as an exclusion criterion for neurotropic melanoma.\r"

Up to 6 months infants who were given breast feeds, with or without other milks, had less diarrhoea and/or vomiting than those given bottle feeds only. Breast feeding seemed to protect the infant against possible introduced infections even when other milks were given along with the breast milk. After 6 months breast feeding did not reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal infection. In both upper and lower social class families infants given solids before 3 months had less diarrhoea and/or vomiting than those given solids later. Bottle fed infants aged 3-6 months in upper social class families had fewer gastrointestinal problems than those of lower social class families. This study suggests that up to the age of 6 months, in this population, breast feeding protects the infant against diarrhoea and/or vomiting, but other milks and solids can safely be given to supplement the breast milk. Breast feeding conferred no significant protection after 6 months.\r"

No difference in gastric emptying was observed in children aged under 3 years, regardless of the presence or absence of the gastro-oesophageal reflux, the pressure of the lower oesophageal sphincter, or the presence of oesophagitis. In children over 6 years, however, gastric emptying was significantly delayed in those presenting with reflux compared with those without reflux; in children over 3 years there was slower gastric emptying in those with a decreased lower oesophageal sphincter pressure compared with those with higher pressure and in those with overt oesophagitis compared with those without oesophagitis. This study suggests that gastro-oesophageal reflux is more severe in childhood than in infancy, probably due to more complex motor disorders affecting the gastric fundus as well as lower oesophageal sphincter function.\r"

Their measurements were compared with established standards for sitting height and leg length in British children (aged 16-18 years). To examine the effects of spinal irradiation on spinal growth independent of growth hormone deficiency we analysed the leg length (LL) minus sitting height (SH) standard deviation score (SDS) and used the cranial group as controls. There was an overall significant difference between the median craniospinal LL-SH SDS (1.98) and the median cranial LL-SH SDS (0.545). Within the craniospinal group there was a significant correlation with age at treatment, but there was no such correlation for the cranial group. After splitting age at treatment into three groups (0 less than 5, 5 less than 10, and 10-15 years) there was a significant difference between the LL-SH SDS of the craniospinal and cranial groups for each of the age ranges. In conclusion, spinal irradiation has a profound effect on spinal growth and the younger the child is when given irradiation the greater the subsequent skeletal disproportion. Our most conservative figures indicate that the eventual loss in height is 9 cm when irradiation is given at 1 year, 7 cm when given at 5 years, and 5.5 cm when given at 10 years.\r"

Raised IgG alpha gliadin antibody concentrations were found in 19 (95%). Fifty of 57 patients (88%) with a normal jejunal mucosa had normal alpha gliadin antibody concentrations. These results are similar to those previously reported in a prospective study of adult patients with coeliac disease and indicate that measurement of alpha gliadin antibody is a highly sensitive and specific screening test for childhood coeliac disease.\r"

A commonly cited cut off point is 1.0 IU/ml. We analysed 5353 cord blood samples for IgE by means of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Descriptive statistics of the distribution curve of cord blood IgE concentrations showed that most normal values were well below the cut off value of 1.0 IU/ml and that most abnormal values were in the neighbourhood of 1.0 IU/ml. It seems advantageous, therefore, to lower the cut off value for cord blood IgE. When cord blood IgE was analysed according to the child's month of birth a significantly uneven distribution of abnormal cases of cord blood IgE concentrations over the year was found. The occurrence of an abnormal cord blood IgE concentration showed a significant cyclic trend, with a peak near the end of April and a trough in late October.\r"

  ".W": "The causes of 215 infant deaths occurring in a population based cohort of 5914 infants from southern Brazil were determined. Perinatal problems were responsible for 43% of these deaths and infectious diseases for 32%. In the group who died of infectious diseases, respiratory infections and diarrhoea were equally important, each accounting for 12% of all deaths. A total of 87% of the deaths occurred in the first six months of life, and this proportion remained high (77%) even after perinatal causes had been excluded. On the other hand, 53% of the infants who died were of low birth weight, as opposed to 7.9% of the survivors. This suggests that low birthweight infants need to be carefully followed by health workers at primary level, especially during the first six months. It was estimated that if the incidence of low birth weight was reduced from the present 8.8% to 5% the likely reduction in infant mortality would be 20%. This reduction would be 33% for deaths due to perinatal causes, 14% for respiratory infections, and only 5% for diarrhoea. Efforts for the prevention of infant deaths in southern Brazil are more likely to be effective if they concentrate on improving perinatal health care and environmental conditions.\r"

The problems of measurement bias, inadequate comparison populations, small numbers of patients, subgroup analyses, and overreliance on simple significance tests are all possible reasons for the variation in results. To clarify this issue, we studied heights at diagnosis of 3657 children and adolescents aged under 18 years. Their malignancies included acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia, osteosarcoma, retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma. Compared with published standards for the heights of children in control populations, no significant deviation from population norms was found for patients in any of the 10 disease categories after proper adjustment for multiple significance testing.\r"

To determine if pets could serve as sentinels of human health risks associated with this contamination, we asked pet owners in a pilot study of exposed human populations about their pets' illnesses. Of 13 pets with owner-reported illnesses, 8 had potential TCDD exposures and 5 did not (p less than .05 by Mantel-Haenzel chi-square analysis stratified by age). Owner-reported illnesses in 2 of 8 illness categories were associated with TCDD contamination after adjusting for age. Although these findings suggest that pets in TCDD-contaminated areas may have greater health risks, the small sample size, unlikely pathologic groupings, and unconfirmed nature of the data fail to support a relationship between pet illnesses and possible TCDD exposure and thus make extrapolation to human populations inappropriate. The limited validity found for owner-reported pet illnesses should caution against using such data in future environmental health studies.\r"

Opposite reactions of heart rate were observed when blood pressure decreased to 70-80 mm Hg following inhalation. Moreover, both tachycardia from relatively low concentrations and bradycardia from higher concentrations were blocked by pre-administration of adrenergic beta blocker, but were only slightly affected by vagotomy. It is suggested that both tachycardia and bradycardia following 1,1,1-TCE inhalation may be controlled by the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

No particular characteristics were noted in the occupations of secondary PCI patients. Primary PCI, occurring more frequently in females (15/21), affected predominantly the large intestine (20/21), locally involving the sigmoid colon in the majority (14) of the patients. Most patients with primary PCI (16/21) were factory workers, of whom 15 (71.4%) were engaged in degreasing of manufacturing products with trichloroethylene.

The management of 39 patients with colonic volvulus treated over 9 years was reviewed. Five per cent were treated with rectal tube decompression alone, 23% were treated with either sigmoidoscopic or colonoscopic reduction, and 26% were treated exclusively with operation. Endoscopic reduction was attempted in nearly half of the patients in preparation for operation. Recurrent volvulus occurred in 57% of patients initially treated with endoscopic reduction alone. Sigmoidoscopic examination did not confirm the diagnosis in 24% of instances in which it was used, although colonoscopy was always diagnostic. The overall mortality rate was 8%, but increased to 25% in patients with gangrene of the colon. Three patients who later proved to have gangrene of the colon had a normal initial sigmoidoscopic examination. Two of these patients died of intra-abdominal sepsis from a perforated colon. In five patients an accurate endoscopic diagnosis of gangrene prompted immediate exploration. None of these patients died. Endoscopy is a safe and effective diagnostic tool for the initial evaluation of patients with suspected colon volvulus. In addition, endoscopy may result in therapeutic decompression and may provide visual assessment of the viability of the bowel mucosa, thus assisting in the timing of appropriate operative treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Origin of the right pulmonary artery from the aorta is a congenital malformation usually associated with serious symptoms in the first year of life and characterized by a poor prognosis. Sixty-five patients with this disorder have been reviewed in the literature, and 95% presented during the first year with signs of congestive heart failure. All had cardiomegaly by radiographic and electrocardiographic examination. An accurate diagnosis was established by cineangiography, and associated cardiovascular anomalies were present in 85%. Origin of the right pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta is much more common than origin of the left pulmonary artery from this vessel (8 to 1). Twenty-three patients were managed without operation with a 30% 1-year survival rate. Among those patients managed surgically, the survival rate was 84% at 1 year. It is now clear that operation should be done as early as possible to prevent irreversible changes occurring in the pulmonary arterial vasculature since microscopic features of pulmonary hypertension have been seen during the first month of life. One patient was operated on at 5 months with correction of the deformity. The pulmonary arterial pressure decreased to normal after operation. This child is now asymptomatic and his 10-year postoperative follow-up is the longest found in the literature.\r"

  ".W": "Five days after thyroidectomy (Tx) or sham-Tx in young male Sprague-Dawley rats, sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Control animals underwent laparotomy and manipulation of the cecum without ligation or puncture. Sixteen hours after CLP or laparotomy, protein synthesis and degradation were measured in incubated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus (SOL) muscles by determining rate of 14C-phenylalanine incorporation into protein and tyrosine release into incubation medium, respectively. Triiodothyronine (T3) was measured in serum and muscle tissue. Protein synthesis was reduced by 39% and 22% in EDL and SOL, respectively, 16 hours after CLP in sham-Tx rats. The response to sepsis of protein synthesis was abolished in Tx rats. Protein breakdown was increased by 113% and 68% in EDL and SOL, respectively, 16 hours after CLP in sham-Tx animals. The increase in muscle proteolysis during sepsis was blunted in hypothyroid animals and was 42% and 49% in EDL and SOL, respectively. T3 in serum was reduced by sepsis, both in Tx and sham-Tx rats. T3 in muscle, however, was maintained or increased during sepsis. Abolished or blunted response of muscle protein turnover after CLP in hypothyroid animals may reflect a role of thyroid hormones in altered muscle protein metabolism during sepsis. Reduced serum levels of T3, but maintained or increased muscle concentrations of the hormone, suggests that increased T3 uptake by muscle may be one mechanism of low T3 syndrome in sepsis, further supporting the concept of a role for thyroid hormone in metabolic alterations in muscle during sepsis.\r"

There were 22 men and six women. Ages ranged from 17 to 74 years with a mean age of 56.7. All patients with HCC had underlying liver disease: liver cirrhosis in 14 and chronic hepatitis in seven. Extended right lobectomy was done on 10 patients, right lobectomy on 16 patients, and left lobectomy on two patients. The residual liver size was serially estimated with computed tomography (CT) in 15 patients: six with normal liver, five with chronic hepatitis, and four with cirrhosis. A complete restoration of the residual liver size was found within 3 months in 3 and 6 months, respectively, in two patients with normal livers. The liver was enlarged in all patients with the parenchymal diseases but obviously more slowly compared with normal liver. Liver functions were restored normally within 2-3 weeks in patients with normal livers, but hyperbilirubinemia persisted longer in those with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. A continuous rise of bilirubin was an ominous sign of liver failure and subsequent death, which occurred in five patients with cirrhosis. Serum alpha-fetoprotein did not rise in accordance with the regeneration. Histologically, evidence of active regeneration with increased mitotic activity was found at 10 and 35 days in those patients with normal livers. Mitosis was not seen in a specimen taken at 7 days. Enlarged cuboidal hepatocytes and cells with basophilic cytoplasm or two nuclei were observed more or less in all specimens. The livers with cirrhosis or hepatitis also showed histologic evidence of regeneration during the first 2 months but substantially less compared with normal liver, which was well supported by the volumetric study of the liver remnants with CT.\r"

  ".W": "The significance of regional therapy against the intrahepatic recurrence for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was evaluated. During the past 6 years, 101 patients who had radical operations for HCC (liver cirrhosis, 75%; chronic hepatitis, 22%) were followed. Forty-seven patients (47%) had recurrences; the liver was the site of first recurrence in 43 patients and distant site recurrence in four patients. In the patients where the liver was the recurrent site, 33 patients (77%) received regional therapies for an aggregate total of 60 times. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization was chosen as the first preferred therapy against recurrence in the liver in 30 of 33 patients (91%). Postrecurrence survival of the patients treated with regional therapy was significantly better than disease-free survival (p less than 0.001). Disease-free survival after surgery, postrecurrence survival, and postsurgery survival were compared in the patients treated with regional therapy and untreated patients. Fifty per cent survival after recurrence of the treated patients was 27 months, and that of the untreated patients was 3 months. Postrecurrence survival (p less than 0.001) and postsurgery survival (p less than 0.01) of the treated patients were significantly better than those of the untreated patients. To obtain successful long-term survival after surgery for the cirrhotic patients with HCC, it is necessary to repeat active regional therapies against the recurrent liver.\r"

Seven patients received placebo and seven patients received BSHGH, 0.1 mg/kg/24 h, for the first six postoperative days. Mean total nitrogen excretion was significantly lower with BSHGH (31.5 +/- 2.4 g N) (2287 +/- 160 mmol) than with placebo (42.7 +/- 3.1 g N) (3049 +/- 219 mmol) over the 6-day study period. The mean daily measured energy expenditure over days 3-6 was higher with BSHGH (31.3 +/- 1.8 kcal/kg LBM/24 h) (131 +/- 7 kJ/kg LBM/24 h) than with placebo (27.6 +/- 0.8 kcal/kg LBM/24 h) (114 +/- 2 kJ/kg LBM/24 h). Fat oxidation with BSHGH (2.05 +/- 0.26 mg/kg LBM/24 h) was greater than with placebo (1.5 +/- 0.17 mg/kg LBM/24 h) and protein oxidation was less with BSHGH (0.68 +/- 0.07 g/kg LBM/24 h) than with placebo (0.9 +/- 0.09 g/kg LBM/24 h) on days 1-6. Postoperative nitrogen turnover (BSHGH 943 +/- 174 mg N/kg LBM/24 h, placebo 557 +/- 50 mg N/kg LBM/24 h) (BSHGH 67 +/- 13 mmol/kg LBM/24 h, placebo 40 +/- 4 mmol/kg LBM/24 h), protein synthesis (BSHGH 5.31 +/- 1.09 g prot/kg LBM/24 h, placebo 2.54 +/- 0.33 g prot/kg LBM/24 h) and protein breakdown (BSHGH 5.90 +/- 1.09 g prot/kg LBM/24 h, placebo 3.48 +/- 0.31 g prot/kg LBM/24 h) were greater with BSHGH. On the first postoperative day serum insulin and blood glucose levels were higher with BSHGH than with placebo, and on days 4 and 7 serum somatomedin-C levels were significantly elevated. This study shows that BSHGH alters postoperative protein and energy metabolism by reducing protein oxidation and increasing fat oxidation with raised rates of whole body nitrogen turnover.\r"

Detailed clinical and laboratory evaluation, including detailed immunologic survey and hand angiography, allowed establishment of the precise mechanisms responsible for vascular occlusions in each patient. Three mechanisms were identified: arteritis, hyperviscosity, and hypercoagulability. Digital gangrene associated with malignancy is a rare condition, the mechanism for which can be deduced by careful diagnostic evaluation.\r"

Fourteen infants had a totally uncomplicated course and have not required further admissions. Thirteen infants had early postoperative problems including six with delayed gastric emptying, four with anastomotic strictures requiring dilatation, and two with radiologic anastomotic leaks. Four late complications consisted of two adhesion intestinal obstructions, a perforation related to a jejunal feeding tube, and a child in whom malabsorption subsequently developed. An excellent result has been obtained in 24 infants, four doing well with only minor problems with feeding, and two are fair experiencing persisting difficulties. These results compare favorably with a large previous experience in colon interposition.\r"

All but two patients were classified as Child's class A and all but three had a prothrombin time over 60% of normal values. Twenty-two esophagogastrostomies were performed through a separate abdominal and right thoracic approach in 15 patients, a left thoracoabdominal approach in five patients, and without thoracotomy in two patients. One patient had a colon interposition. Six patients died after operation (26%) as a result of anastomotic leakage in two patients, hepatorenal in three patients and portal thrombosis in one patient. The type of procedure did not influence mortality. The most common postoperative complication was the development of ascites (65%), and when associated with hepatorenal syndrome there was a significant mortality (p less than 0.05). Sepsis was present in the terminal stages of all nonsurvivors. A prothrombin time less than or equal to 60% of normal values was the only significant preoperative predictive factor of mortality, with none of the three patients surviving below this level (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that the presence of cirrhosis is not a contraindication to esophagogastrectomy for carcinoma when curative resection can be undertaken. Hepatic reserve is the determinant factor of operative prognosis. Operative risk is acceptable if patients are classified as Child's class A and prothrombin time is over 60% of normal values. Operation should be delayed when acute alcoholic hepatitis is present. Intraoperative discovery of cirrhosis is not a contraindication to resection where the above criteria are met. This strict selection allows one to anticipate a lower mortality rate.\r"

Multivariate analysis showed that appearance of early remissions among all patients was significantly and independently influenced by thymectomy, by milder disease, and by absence of coexisting thymomas. Patients with mild generalized symptoms treated with thymectomy reached remission more frequently, even when compared with those with ocular myasthenia treated without surgery. Short duration of disease before thymectomy in mild cases was another factor associated with earlier remissions. Mortality for all patients was significantly and independently influenced by severity of symptoms, age, associated thymomas, and failure to remove the thymus. Patients without thymectomy and with thymomas had, in addition, earlier onset of extrathymic neoplasms. Morbidity after the transcervical approach was minimal. This study demonstrates that early thymectomy by the transcervical approach, when technically feasible, has significant clinical advantages over the transthoracic approach and should be advocated for all patients with myasthenia gravis, including those with ocular disease.\r"

A 12-unit dose of smoke was fatal within 72 hours and an 18-unit dose was fatal within 24 hours. The best correlation between smoke dose and response was observed in arterial oxygen tension 24 hours after exposure. At 24 hours, most of the cardiopulmonary indices showed significant change only after a 12-unit exposure. Although the exact shape of the dose-response curve could not be defined, sigmoid or curved linear shape was suggested, reflecting the progressive deterioration.\r"

There were 193 cases of partial small bowel obstruction (PSBO) and 149 cases of complete small bowel obstruction (CSBO) as determined by interpretation of the abdominal radiographs done on admission. The purpose of this review was to determine the reliability of the admission plain abdominal radiographs and subsequent upper gastrointestinal (UGI) contrast studies in predicting the need for operative intervention. The use of nasogastric tubes (NGT) versus nasointestinal (long) tubes (NIT) was correlated with the following outcome variables; length of hospital stay (LOS), timing of operative intervention, incidence of postoperative complications, and duration of postoperative ileus. Long tubes (NIT) were used in 64 episodes of PSBO and 81 episodes of CSBO, whereas nasogastric tubes (NGT) were used in 116 cases of PSBO and 68 cases of CSBO. Thirty-eight of 193 (19%) patients with PSBO required operation (20 of 116 with NGT and 18 of 64 with NIT), whereas 125 of 149 (84%) patients with CSBO required operation (60 of 68 with NGT and 65 of 81 with NIT). Need for operation was not correlated with whether or not long tubes passed beyond the pylorus; 50 passed versus 33 not passed in operative groups (p = 0.15). Twelve of 83 patients with NIT had operation within 24 hours versus 52 of 80 patients with NGT (p less than 0.001). In six of 64 patients who had surgery within 24 hours, complications developed versus in 39 of 99 patients operated on more than 24 hours after admission (p less than or equal to 0.001). In 29 of 83 patients treated with NIT, postoperative complications developed versus in 16 of 80 patients with NGT (p less than or equal to 0.04). The mean duration of postoperative ileus in patients with NIT was 7 days versus 4.1 days for NGT patients (p less than 0.001). The mean LOS was 12.2 days for NGT patients versus 21 days for patients with NIT (p less than 0.001). Barium UGI contrast studies were performed in 57 patients to establish the presence of obstruction. In 34 of 57 patients the UGI disclosed mechanical obstruction that required operative intervention. In the remaining 23 patients no obstruction was demonstrated, and all 23 patients recovered without operation. In conclusion, there is no inherent superiority of NIT versus NGT in the treatment of SBO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Laboratory and clinical parameters revealed that choledochoscopy did not cause septicemia, worsen cholangitis, or provoke acute pancreatitis. There was no iatrogenic injury during choledochoscopy, and the choledochoscopic views were minimally affected by cholangitis. Choledochoscopy detected overlooked stones after conventional methods of exploration of common bile ducts in 14.3% of patients and it helped to remove impacted stones in 2.9% of patients. As a result, the incidence of retained stones after choledochoscopy was 1.4%. Time spent in choledochoscopy was short, and the total postoperative septic complication rate was only 10%. There was no operative mortality. It is concluded that choledochoscopy is safe and effective in cholangitis.\r"

  ".W": "This study was conducted to elucidate plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) response after pancreatoduodenectomy and to compare response of CCK and PP in patients who had pancreatoduodenectomy with Billroth I and Billroth II type of reconstruction. Basal levels of plasma CCK were significantly lower in patients who had pancreatoduodenectomy (9.6 +/- 0.8 pmol/L) than in the control (preoperative patients: 14.6 +/- 2.0 pmol/L) probably because of the removal of the entire duodenum due to pancreatoduodenectomy, since vagotomy, which is concomitantly brought about by pancreatoduodenectomy, does not appear to interfere with release of CCK. Significant amounts of CCK (integrated CCK: 497 +/- 111 pmol-120 min/L), although less amounts than in the preoperative patients (integrated CCK: 901 +/- 167 pmol-120 min/L), were still released in response to oral fatty meal after pancreatoduodenectomy. Plasma CCK response to oral fatty meal was significantly greater in patients who had pancreatoduodenectomy with Billroth I type of reconstruction (integrated CCK: 705 +/- 153 pmol-120 min/L) than in patients who had pancreatoduodenectomy with Billroth II type of reconstruction (248 +/- 63 pmol-120 min/L). Simultaneous measurement of plasma levels of PP revealed complete abolishment of PP response by pancreatoduodenectomy. Since PP secretion can be produced by vagal stimulation, it is most likely that the decreased PP secretion is due to vagotomy rather than removal of the duodenum and pancreas. Significant amounts of CCK released after pancreatoduodenectomy, in which the main sources of release of CCK are removed, may suggest the compensatory mechanism of the remnant upper small intestine. This study also suggests the necessity of re-evaluating Billroth I type of anastomosis as a physiologic reconstruction procedure for the remnant alimentary tract after pancreatoduodenectomy.\r"

This study tests whether ischemia-induced eicosanoid synthesis leads to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) accumulation in the lungs. Anesthetized rats (N = 51) were randomized into five groups: nonischemic sham rats (N = 10); the remaining four groups were rats made ischemic for 4 hours with bilateral thigh tourniquets treated just before tourniquet release with saline vehicle (N = 17): the thromboxane (Tx) synthase inhibitor OKY-046 (Ono Pharmaceutica, Osaka, Japan) 2 mg/kg intravenously every 2 hours (N = 8); the lipoxygenase inhibitor diethylcarbamazine (DEC) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) 0.2 mg/kg/min intravenously (N = 8); the platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist SRI (Sandoz Inc., East Hanover, NJ) 63-072 3 mg/kg intravenously every 30 minutes (N = 8). Four hours after ischemia, plasma TxB2 levels in the ischemic placebo-treated group was 3570 +/- 695 pg/mL, compared with 495 +/- 73 pg/mL in sham rats (p less than 0.001). Lung microscopy showed foci of proteinaceous exudate in alveoli and 121 +/- 10 PMN/20 high power fields (HPF) compared with 59 +/- 9 PMN/20 HPF in the sham group (p less than 0.001). One day after ischemia PMN accumulations remained elevated at 119 PMN/20 HPF. Pretreatment with OKY-046 led to reduced TxB2 levels of 149 +/- 17 pg/mL, normal lung histology, and 83 +/- 13 PMN/20 HPF, a value similar to that of the sham group and lower than that of the placebo-treated group (p less than 0.05). Treatment with DEC yielded TxB2 levels of 1419 +/- 492 pg/mL, which was lower than that of the placebo group (p less than 0.05) but higher than that of the sham group (p less than 0.05). Microscopy showed normal lungs with 79 +/- 7 PMN/20 HPF lower than the placebo group (p less than 0.05). SRI 63-072 did not inhibit Tx synthesis or leukosequestration in the lungs. Platelet counts decreased in all groups relative to sham animals (p less than 0.05). The results indicate that Tx synthesis induced by ischemia moderates PMN accumulations in the lungs. Inhibition of lipoxygenase is believed to prevent PMN accumulations both by limiting leukotriene-induced Tx synthesis as well as by limiting production of chemoattractants.\r"

  ".W": "An experience on the surgical treatment of anastomotic false aneurysms during the last 15 years was reviewed. Fifty-nine were femoral anastomoses complicated by false aneurysm appearance requiring surgical excision. They represented 2.9% of all femoral anastomoses performed, whereas they represented 3.3% when considering reconstruction in which the femoral artery was the distal anastomosis. Reconstructions with distal anastomosis performed on the femoral artery were primarily involved (58 of 59), whereas grafts with \"take off\" from the femoral artery were rarely affected (p less than 0.05). A higher incidence of false aneurysm formation was demonstrated in hypertensive patients (p less than 0.05) as well as those who previously had femoral thromboendarterectomy (p less than 0.01). Infection was considered a causative factor even if it developed before (6-14 months) false aneurysm appearance. When a false aneurysm was resected, the best hemodynamic reconstruction, to avoid recurrence, was considered a bypass with distal anastomosis performed end-to-end on the femoral artery (p less than 0.05). The surgical treatment of choice was false aneurysm resection and graft interposition. However, a reanastomosis in the presence of small false aneurysms, when technically possible, has been successfully performed. Both treatments allowed good long-term results.\r"

Five of the 11 patients would have been diagnosed as having a reflux etiology of their stricture if 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring was not performed. Six patients responded to dilatation and five patients required resection or bypass. A prospective study of 18 asymptomatic volunteers showed a high incidence of esophageal lodgment of a radiolabeled medicinal capsule, with subsequent dissolution and release of the isotope. This occurred most frequently in elderly subjects and was reduced by increasing the volume of water chaser. The sites of lodgment correspond to the location of the observed strictures in the patient population. An in vitro study showed that, when the causative drugs were mixed with saliva, dissolution occurred within 60 minutes and was associated with significant changes in pH. These investigations show that drug-induced esophageal strictures are more common than previously appreciated, and can be confused with a reflux etiology. Diagnosis is suggested by a history of drug ingestion, location of the stricture, and a normal esophageal acid exposure on 24-hour pH monitoring. The severity of the esophageal injury is variable and requires dilatation to resection for therapy.\r"

This prompted an investigation by new injection techniques and corrosion on the human esophageal vasculature three-dimensionally. The three main arterial sources were confirmed: the superior thyroid artery, bronchial arteries at the level of the carina, and the left gastric and splenic artery. Two facts became obvious that were not appreciated hitherto. All major vascular trees divide into minute branches at some distance from the esophagus. Those branches go on to form a dense submucosal interconnected network. It appears that such small extraesophageal branches, when torn, will have the benefit of contractile hemostasis. Previous claims made that essential nutritional vessels arise from intercostal phrenic arteries or the aorta directly could not be confirmed. These findings would confirm blunt esophagectomy for tumors within the wall of the organ as a relatively safe procedure in terms of bleeding hazards.\r"

Each patient had dysphagia and weight loss before therapy and could not be operated on because of the extent of the tumor or poor performance status. Patients received a photosensitizer (hematoporphyrin derivative) 72 hours before phototherapy and were then treated by light delivered by an argon pumped dye laser or gold metal vapor laser at powers up to 2.2 W and doses of 337 J/cm2. Fourteen patients received 24 treatments. The results were all patients achieved a tumor response. The depth of response depended on the dose and dose rate of radiation. There were four of 24 local complications (mediastinitis 3, bronchoesophageal fistula 1). These occurred in patients treated with a power of greater than 1.5 W. There were two complete pathologic remissions in patients with locally advanced cancer. In conclusion, phototherapy is an effective alternative to other forms of palliation and potentially may be an alternative to surgery in selected cases of locally advanced esophageal cancer.\r"

Emergency thoracotomies for resuscitation of the patient with blunt chest trauma with absent vital signs proved unsuccessful in 39 of 39 patients. A high index of suspicion for blunt chest injury occurring in blunt trauma, coupled with an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach, remains the cornerstone of treatment to minimize the morbidity and mortality of such injuries.\r"

The most optimistic, published survival statistics demonstrate a 25% 5-year survival advantage for patients who have PRLND with an incidence of occult nodal disease of 14.3%; thus, even the most optimistic data would predict that only a modest number of patients would actually benefit from surgery. It is difficult to justify PRLND for its therapeutic benefit unless a higher yield of positive-node patients is obtained or the surgical indication is for staging or prognostic information.\r"

Changes in these values were compared with alterations in extravascular lung water (EVLW), the serum oncotic pressure-pulmonary artery occluded pressure gradient and the alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen tension [D(A-a)O2] before and immediately after bypass and in the surgical intensive care unit after operation. A significant increase in EVLW was associated with a decrease in serum OP and an increase in D(A-a)O2 immediately after bypass. However, EVLW values had returned to baseline by time of determination in the surgical intensive care unit. Cost savings may be realized by the use of hydroxyethyl starch in this setting if average wholesale price data are representative of costs throughout the country.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, the rates of lipid mobilization and of lipolysis have been quantified in severely burned children. In all 12 patients studied, the basal rates were determined. In seven patients, the lipolytic responsiveness to an infusion of epinephrine (0.015 micrograms/kg/min) was tested, and in the other five patients, the response to beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 1 mg/kg) was tested. The rate of appearance (Ra) of free fatty acids (FFA) was quantified by means of the infusion of 1-13C-palmitate to determine the rate of lipid mobilization, and Ra glycerol was determined using d5-glycerol to assess the rate of lipolysis more directly. In five patients, body composition was determined after recovery by means of H2(18)O dilution. The basal rate of lipolysis was higher than normal in the burned children. In four of the seven patients infused with epinephrine, there was a pronounced increase in Ra glycerol. In all patients given beta-blockade, Ra glycerol decreased greatly. Changes in Ra FFA corresponded with the changes in Ra glycerol in each case. Total body fat was very low (approximately 2% body weight), reflecting the surgical removal of fat in the process of burn wound excision. From these data it is concluded that lipolytic responsiveness to catecholamines in severely burned children is variable, but not absent, despite chronically elevated levels of catecholamines. The total extent of lipolysis may be limited by the available fat mass in children treated with fascial excision. In such patients, the limitation in the ability to mobilize an adequate amount of FFA to fully meet energy requirements provides an important rationale for the clinical practice of providing nutritional support in hourly boluses, as opposed to infrequent meals, since any period of even a few hours in which nutrients are not being absorbed will result in an energy substrate deficiency and consequent increase in amino acid oxidation.\r"

A canine model of pulmonary resection and IORT was investigated by performing a pneumonectomy in 15 adult foxhounds followed by 0 cGy, 2,000 cGy, 3,000 cGy, 4,000 cGy. No clinical complications developed in 4 animals in the 2,000-cGy group. However, 2 of the 8 animals given a high dose died of esophageal hemorrhage or carinal necrosis. Esophagitis occurred in 10 of 12 animals, and none of the animals experienced bronchial stump dehiscence. In a limited Phase I protocol, 4 patients with non-small cell lung cancer were treated with resection and 2,500 cGy of IORT to two separate ports encompassing the superior and inferior mediastinum. Two patients experienced life-threatening bronchopleural fistulas, and 2 patients died as a consequence of esophageal problems. One patients had recurrence with brain metastases, and the 1 long-term survivor is free from disease. As opposed to the animal model of thoracic IORT, the clinical study demonstrated major toxicity with respiratory and esophageal morbidity. The therapeutic usefulness of thoracic IORT in the management of lung cancer must be questioned in view of this small but consistent series of patients. Further carefully designed clinical studies using lower doses of IORT are needed.\r"

The pump was introduced into the thoracic aorta at the level of the eight thoracic vertebra in 11 canine right-heart bypass preparations. Heart rate (110 beats per minute), stroke volume (20 ml), and mean arterial pressure (80 or 100 mm Hg) were precisely controlled. The pump ejection volume was adjusted to equal 1 time or 2 times the stroke volume of the dog. A 20-ml ejection led to an 11% reduction in left atrial pressure, an 11% reduction in peak left ventricular pressure, and a 20% reduction in tension time index (all, p less than .05 at a mean arterial pressure of 80 mm Hg). Systolic shortening (ultrasonic crystals) increased by 5% (p less than .05 at a mean arterial pressure of 80 mm Hg). A 40-ml pump ejection led to an 11% reduction in mean left atrial pressure, a 17% reduction in peak left ventricular pressure, and a 21% reduction in tension time index (all, p less than .05 at a mean arterial pressure of 80 mm Hg). The systolic shortening increased by 15% (p less than .05). To assess the relative risk of cerebral embolism, albumin spheres (40 to 60 micrograms) labeled with technetium-99 were injected into the pump chamber in 5 dogs (40-ml ejection, 2.1 +/- 0.1 times the dog's stroke volume).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In all of these patients, a percutaneous attempt failed or was contraindicated. There were 24 (62%) men and 15 (38%) women. The mean age was 64.9 years. Five patients (13%) sustained complications potentially related to the transthoracic IABP. They included mediastinal infection in 1 patient (2.5%), balloon rupture in 2 patients (5%), and cerebrovascular accidents in 4 patients (10%). The overall survival was 44%. Survival for the group of patients weaned from transthoracic IABP support was 17 (81%) of 21. There were no deaths directly related to the transthoracic IABP. The transthoracic IABP was removed under local anesthesia without sternotomy in 19 (90%) of the patients weaned and with formal sternotomy in the remaining 2 (9%). In a select group of patients requiring intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, the use of the transthoracic IABP is a reasonable second choice for patients in whom other methods of balloon support are not feasible.\r"

Five internal mammary artery pedicle grafts, harvested but not utilized for coronary bypass, underwent histological examination. The histological studies demonstrated that the vasa vasorum were confined to the adventitia and did not penetrate the media of the internal mammary artery. These observations indicate that the media is nourished entirely from the lumen and suggest that harvesting the internal mammary artery as a free graft would not subject the wall of the artery to ischemic injury. Subsequent to these studies, we used the right internal mammary artery as a free graft to revascularize the distal circumflex coronary artery in 12 patients. The free graft was anastomosed to marginal branches of the circumflex and was then brought up to the left internal mammary artery pedicle graft and anastomosed end-to-side. This procedure has not resulted in excessive postoperative bleeding or sternal infections, and has relieved the anginal syndrome in all 12 patients.\r"

The procedure was used in 6 mongrel dogs with preexisting surgically created coarctation. Aortic cross-clamping time ranged between 7.5 and 11 minutes (mean, 8.8 +/- 1.3 minutes). There were no operative deaths or complications. Gross and microscopic examination of the aorta 6 to 12 months (mean, 9 +/- 2.2 months) postoperatively revealed a 290 to 380% (mean, 350 +/- 30%) increase in the diameter of the repaired area and no evidence of thrombosis or pseudoaneurysm formation. The need for minimal dissection and the brief period of aortic cross-clamping make this approach an attractive alternative in the surgical treatment of patients with difficult cases of recoarctation.\r"

Since 1976, 10 of 3,000 patients operated on for congenital heart disease have sustained phrenic nerve injury with subsequent respiratory embarrassment. An additional patient sustained phrenic nerve injury as a result of birth trauma. The diagnosis was confirmed by paradoxical diaphragmatic motion on fluoroscopy. All but 2 patients were less than 5 months old at the time of diaphragmatic plication, and the average weight was 5.4 kg. The indication for diaphragmatic plication was inability to wean from the ventilator in 8 of the 11 patients and persistent postoperative tachypnea, stridor, and CO2 retention in the remaining 3 patients. A more aggressive approach to diagnosis and operative treatment since 1980 has resulted in a substantially shorter duration of endotracheal intubation and a shorter stay in the intensive care unit. Diaphragmatic fluoroscopy 1 to 7 years postoperatively has demonstrated return of normal function in 6 of 6 patients studied.\r"

  ".W": "This study determines the additional protection provided by multidose hypothermic potassium blood cardioplegia over cardiopulmonary bypass alone following one hour of coronary occlusion. In 19 anesthetized dogs having an open-chest procedure, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was occluded for one hour, and this resulted in loss of active shortening in the affected zone (sonomicrometry). Cardiopulmonary bypass was established, and the dogs were divided into two groups based on the mode of reperfusion. In 10 dogs, hearts were arrested for one hour with amino acid-enhanced multi-dose blood cardioplegia; the ligatures were removed prior to the second infusion. In the 9 remaining dogs, the ligatures were removed and reperfusion was initiated with unmodified blood on total vented bypass. Both groups were reperfused for one additional hour. Postischemic levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were comparable in the blood cardioplegia and bypass groups, and subendocardial levels averaged 42.8% and 45.8% of controls, respectively. Levels of creatine phosphate returned to control values. Subendocardial water content was significantly less in the blood cardioplegia hearts than the bypass hearts (79.4 +/- 0.5% vs. 81.5 +/- 0.5%; p less than .05); subendocardial water content in the blood cardioplegia group was not different from controls (78.6 +/- 0.1%). Blood cardioplegia restored significantly more fractional shortening than total vented bypass alone (39.3 +/- 9.8% vs. 6.3 +/- 9.1% of control), despite similarities in postischemic levels of ATP. We conclude that blood cardioplegia allows better myocardial salvage in the setting of evolving infarction. Therefore, attention must be directed to both the conditions (bypass, delivery pressure) and composition (cardioplegia) of reperfusion.\r"

Age at operation ranged from 1.3 to 18.8 years (mean, 6.7 +/- 4.5 years [+/- standard deviation]). Seventeen patients were male, and 13 were female. Two-dimensional echocardiography was used after 1978 in the initial evaluation of 20 patients; however, the diagnosis of DCRV was made with the use of subcostal views only since 1984 in 4 of 5 patients. Surgical correction consisted of closure of the VSD and resection of anomalous muscle bundles through a right ventriculotomy (28 patients), and right atriotomy (2 patients). All patients survived and are asymptomatic 4.2 +/- 3.4 years following operation. Six patients have undergone catheterization postoperatively and 8 patients had intraoperative pressure recordings. The mean preoperative ratio of right ventricular to left ventricular pressures was 0.67 +/- 0.22 compared with 0.34 +/- 0.15 postoperatively (p less than .001). In 2 patients, DCRV was not recognized preoperatively or at VSD closure through a right atriotomy, and reoperation was necessary after DCRV was demonstrated at postoperative catheterization. DCRV may occur in approximately 10% of patients undergoing correction of VSD. Careful evaluation of echocardiographic and catheterization data preoperatively and careful evaluation of the anatomy intraoperatively are necessary so that DCRV not be overlooked, especially because most VSDs are now closed through the right atrium. Successful correction of VSD and DCRV is associated with excellent long-term results.\r"

In the past five years, five instances of disc immobilization (three in the mitral and two in the aortic position) occurred either at the time of weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass or immediately thereafter. When the implanted site of the prosthetic valve was the mitral position, reexploration in 2 patients revealed chordal remnants in the subannular area stuck between the disc occluder and the valve ring, thereby immobilizing the disc. In the third instance, the free movement of the disc was impeded by the left ventricular myocardium. In the aortic position, an unraveled suture impacted between the disc occluder and the valve ring immobilized the disc in 1 patient. In the other patient, the cause of the malfunction could not be determined at the time of reexploration. The 1 death among these 5 patients was directly related to the malfunction of the prosthesis. The mechanism, recognition, treatment, and prevention of this catastrophic malfunction of tilting-disc valves are discussed.\r"

Positive responses from all participants were associated with traditional items of dress such as the dress, shirt and tie, dress shoes, and nylons, and for physician-identifying items such as a white coat and a name tag. Negative responses were associated with casual items such as blue jeans, scrub suits, athletic shoes, clogs, and sport socks. Negative ratings were also associated with overly feminine items such as prominent ruffles and female dangling earrings and such temporarily fashionable items as long hair on men, male earrings, and patterned hose on women. Overall, patients were less discriminating in their attitude toward physician appearance than physicians. Patients rated traditional items less positively and casual items less negatively.

The relative risk of dying associated with an abnormal initial electrocardiogram declined from 17 in the academic center to 2.9 in the community hospital. In contrast, a guideline that uses data available after 24 hours of observation did segregate patients at higher and lower risk in both the community and academic hospitals.

The mean values of all liver function tests in groups 1 (n = 43; CI greater than or equal to 2.0 L/min/m2) and 2 (n = 48; CI greater than 1.5 and less than 2.0 L/min/m2) were essentially normal, except for minimally elevated alkaline phosphatase levels and slightly decreased albumin levels in both groups, and slight increases in levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and total bilirubin in group 2. In contrast, group 3 patients (n = 42; CI less than or equal to 1.5 L/min/m2) had the most severe heart failure, as assessed by the lowest CI and highest cardiac filling pressures, and significantly higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase (65 +/- 82 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (77 +/- 102 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (282 +/- 91 U/L), and total bilirubin (29 +/- 14 mumol/L [1.7 +/- 0.8 mg/dL]). The percentage of patients in group 3 with these abnormalities ranged between 27% and 80%. Although linear regression analysis showed that the elevations in right atrial and pulmonary wedge pressures, and the decreases in CI, were significantly correlated with liver function abnormalities, the correlation coefficients were small. Thus, liver function abnormalities remain common in patients with congestive heart failure but are generally small in magnitude and not associated with clinically apparent hepatic disease. It is likely that reduced forward flow and passive backward congestion are both contributing factors in the pathogenesis of these biochemical abnormalities, although nonhemodynamic factors may also be important.\r"

There was a striking increase in painful crises in male patients between the ages of 15 and 25 years, whereas female patients showed little age-related change. The frequency of painful crises correlated positively with hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte counts in both sexes and negatively with mean corpuscular volume in female patients. There was a striking increase in painful crises in male patients with hemoglobin levels above 8.5 g/dL (greater than 85 g/L). High hemoglobin levels appear to be an important risk factor for painful crises.\r"

We compared polysomnographic findings and/or symptomatology both before and after tonsillectomy in six patients aged 22 to 52 years, who had adenotonsillar hypertrophy and OSA. Tonsillectomy provided lasting relief of OSA in four patients. We review the literature for available polygraphic data from similar patients before and after tonsillectomy. Our combined experience indicates that many adults with OSA can clearly benefit from removal of hypertrophied tonsils. Such success may, for some adults, be transient or may not occur. This should be considered during initial patient counseling and when planning postoperative follow-up.\r"

The groups were as follows: group 1, \"minimal\" stress, eg, inguinal hernia repair (n = 10); group 2, \"moderate\" stress, eg, cholecystectomy (n = 12); and group 3, \"severe\" stress, eg, subtotal colectomy (n = 9). Patients in group 1 showed no significant surgery-induced changes in hormonal values. The stress-induced changes in patients in groups 2 and 3 were seen at one and occasionally 24 hours; however, by five days postoperatively, circulating hormone values had returned to preoperative levels. Increases in plasma cortisol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, and decreases in serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels characterized the surgery-induced hormonal changes. Conclusions are as follows: hormonal responses do reflect the degree of surgical stress; the hormonal changes are transient, lasting no longer than 24 hours in patients after uncomplicated surgery; hormonal responses to minimal surgical stress are negligible.\r"

Eighteen internists were presented with three hypothetical cases of patients with coronary artery disease and were asked to explain their treatment decisions. Based on process tracing, we characterized their method of therapeutic decision making. We found that physicians use a three-stage process that we call focal composite analysis: (1) selection of a few facts (focal points) and evaluation of each fact individually with respect to treatment options; (2) reassessment of the value of the focal points with respect to each other and unification of the case; and (3) summation of the values of the focal points to make the final decision. Using this model, we predicted physicians' actual treatment decisions in 96% of the hypothetical cases. Further analysis revealed a wide variety of focal points chosen overall, with most physicians choosing different focal points in each case. Of a total of 32 focal points chosen in three cases, only two focal points were predictors of the physicians' actual treatment choices. We conclude that in the complex problem considered here physicians use a staged process of choosing and evaluating information to make therapeutic choices.\r"

Underlying causes of hypertension were found in 297 patients (7.9%). Eighty-seven patients (2.3%) were considered to have a potentially reversible cause for their hypertension, including the oral contraceptive pill (38 patients), renovascular disease (27 patients), and primary hyperaldosteronism (ten patients), but of these only 33 patients (0.9% of total clinic population) were cured by specific intervention. Two hundred ten patients (5.6%) had irreversible renal parenchymal disease and significantly higher mortality than men and women with other causes of hypertension. Excess deaths in the renal group were attributed to renal failure (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] 580 to 589) and vascular causes (ICD 390 to 458) but not to cancer (ICD 140 to 208; 235 to 239) or other nonvascular disease. These results suggest that investigation of hypertension for an underlying cause will reveal a small number of patients with treatable disorders, of whom only a few will be cured by specific intervention, and a moderate number with irreversible disease who are at high risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.\r"

Patients received two infusions, one of methylphenidate and one of placebo, in randomized order one week apart while receiving neuroleptic treatment and again three weeks after drug withdrawal. Behavioral, cardiovascular, and neurologic responses were evaluated before and after infusion under double-blind conditions. Patients were then followed up without medication for 52 weeks or until symptom recurrence. The results indicate that specific measures, including behavioral response to methylphenidate, presence of tardive dyskinesia, and, under specific pharmacologic conditions, tardive dyskinesia, blink-rate, and pulse-rate responses to methylphenidate, are associated with time and propensity to relapse following neuroleptic withdrawal. These measures may be potentially useful in the identification of candidates for neuroleptic withdrawal and/or dosage-reduction treatment strategies.\r"

These patients were relatively resistant to treatment, as they were unable to live independently outside institutional settings despite conventional neuroleptic therapy. In contrast, sum norepinephrine (Sum NE), measured by summing the molar excretion of NE and its metabolites, was not reduced. These results are highlighted by expressing the data in terms of the ratio of Sum DA/Sum NE. Patients with schizophrenia had a significantly lower ratio. Treatment with haloperidol normalized the low ratio. Urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was normal in the schizophrenic patients. These results suggest that chronic schizophrenia is more likely to be associated with a low rather than a high state of DA activity.\r"

Verification of the inferences made from the computer-generated data has been obtained by direct microscopic visualization and measurement of neuronal aggregates of layer II in Nissl-stained cingulate specimens from the control and schizophrenic groups. Statistical correction of the data, using multivariate statistics, for effects of age, hypoxia, postmortem interval, fixation, and neuroleptic exposure does not eliminate the differences in size and separation of neuronal aggregates in layer II of schizophrenic patients.

The dependent measures were indexes of gray-matter rCBF and average rCBF (gray and white matter) as well as the percentage of gray-matter tissue. Advanced age was associated with reduced flow, particularly pronounced in anterior regions. However, the extent and pattern of rCBF changes during cognition was unaffected by age. For the percentage of gray matter, there was a specific reduction in anterior regions of the left hemisphere.

Overall, the left hemisphere was less dense than the right in the schizophrenics, while the reverse was found for the co-twins and controls.

DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia were found to be highly reliable and valid, and to have a broad heritability of 0.85, which is comparable with the Research Diagnostic Criteria and Feighner criteria from which they were derived. When the full range of DSM-III diagnoses were considered, both affective disorder and schizophrenia were found in genetically identical individuals. The effect of DSM-III nosology on the twin series was also explored by adding other diagnoses to that of schizophrenia and observing the effect on the MZ/DZ concordance ratio. The addition of affective disorder with mood-incongruent delusions to the schizophrenia spectrum produced the largest increase in the ratio and, by implication, a \"more genetic\" combination than schizophrenia alone. The maximum MZ/DZ concordance ratio (7.68) was produced by schizophrenia, plus affective disorder with mood-incongruent delusions, plus schizotypal personality disorder, plus atypical psychosis. The effect of adding paranoid disorder (paranoia) and all other affective categories was a reduction in the ratio.\r"

The patients with BPD were found to differ from patients with nonborderline personality disorders, having a longer P3 latency and smaller P3 amplitude. Long-latency event-related potentials were similar in the BPD and schizophrenic groups and did not differentiate patients with BPD with a concurrent diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder from those without schizotypal personality disorder. The P3 latency and amplitude changes distinguished the BPD and schizophrenic groups from normal controls, those with major depressive disorder, and those with nonborderline personality disorders. These findings suggest that though some patients with BPD may have depressive symptomatology, they share with schizophrenics a dysfunction of auditory neurointegration.\r"

Almost 40% (16/41) of the schizophrenic patients exhibited persistent thought disorder symptoms after the acute phase and an additional 37% (15/41) showed an episodic thought disorder course. Across diagnoses, patients who were thought disordered at both follow-ups demonstrated higher rates of unemployment and rehospitalization than did patients in non-thought-disordered and episodic thought disorder groups. To date, 25% (16/65) of psychotic nonschizophrenic patients showed persistent thought disorder courses similar to schizophrenia, while another 40% (24/65) showed remitting thought disorder symptoms more common to nonpsychotic patients.\r"

  ".U": "87270073\r", 
  ".W": "Recent research on schizophrenia has demonstrated that in this disorder the brain is not, strictly speaking, normal. The findings suggest that nonspecific histopathology exists in the limbic system, diencephalon, and prefrontal cortex, that the pathology occurs early in development, and that the causative process is inactive long before the diagnosis is made. If these findings are valid and not epiphenomena, then the pathogenesis of schizophrenia does not appear to fit either traditional metabolic, posttraumatic, or neurodegenerative models of adult mental illness. The data are more consistent with a neurodevelopmental model in which a fixed \"lesion\" from early in life interacts with normal brain maturational events that occur much later. Based on neuro-ontological principles and insights from animal research about normal brain development, it is proposed that the appearance of diagnostic symptoms is linked to the normal maturation of brain areas affected by the early developmental pathology, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The course of the illness and the importance of stress may be related to normal maturational aspects of dopaminergic neural systems, particularly those innervating prefrontal cortex. Some implications for future research and treatment are considered.\r"

New technologies permit analysis of small quantities of cells (as in fine-needle aspirates), multiple simultaneous markers, oncogene products, and paraffin-embedded tissue. The technique has become the standard for cells normally in suspension (blood, other fluids). For cells readily obtained in suspension (fine-needle aspirates, nuclei), flow cytometry offers a practical alternative to computer-assisted microscopy.\r"

A biosensor is a microelectronic device that utilizes a biological molecule (eg, antibody, enzyme, or receptor) as the sensing or signal-transducing element. Biosensors can be configured into simple, rapid, and cost-effective laboratory devices that will allow the clinical pathologist to become even more responsive to the primary care physician. In those instances where measurements on discrete samples do not provide the required information, continuous monitoring with implantable biosensors could provide real-time data on levels of critical endogenous or exogenous substances. By hybridizing recent advances in transdermal substance collection with the analytical capabilities of biosensors, devices for continuous noninvasive monitoring at the bedside can be envisioned. The clinical pathologist can and should play a key role in the clinical evaluation and implementation of such technological advances.\r"

Although systems have been developed to capture charge-related data in support of cost reimbursement, there has been a conspicuous lack of attention paid to information tools to directly enhance the delivery of patient care. The termination of cost reimbursement, together with an increasing recognition of the problems inherent in current manual record-keeping systems, is creating a significant new focus on medical information. This change in focus requires a shift in systems orientation away from financial and departmentally centered systems and toward patient-centered approaches. There is thus increasing recognition of the need for a physician-level medical information specialist to serve as an institution's chief information officer, assuming responsibility for the collection, manipulation, and availability of all patient care-related data. By virtue of training, typical experience, hospital presence, and a noncompetitive position with the hospital's medical staff, the pathologist is uniquely suited for this position. To effectively perform this role, a variety of new specialized data management tools are becoming available. Integrated information systems, patient care management by exception, decision support tools, and, in the future, \"artificial intelligence\" assists can all be expected to become staples of pathology practice, especially impacting those pathologists who choose to be responsive to the new practice milieu of medical information science.\r"

An immediate challenge is to establish the specifications for a telepathology system. Breast tissue has served as a model. Receiver operator characteristic curve studies show that the pathologist's ability to discriminate benign from malignant breast tumors is similar using either a conventional light microscope or a video monitor with approximately 1000 lines of resolution. The percentage of cases for which pathologists render an \"equivocal\" diagnosis is the same for the two modalities. Telepathology may be an effective way to provide on-line consultations in difficult cases and to provide hospitals in remote areas with immediate access to anatomic pathology services.\r"

Significantly impaired learning was found in animals with lesions to globus pallidus, substantia nigra, median raphe, or pontine reticular formation. These results combined with earlier findings suggest that the foregoing subcortical structures along with the regions of the ventrolateral and parafascicular nuclei of the thalamus constitute a nonspecific mechanism involved not only in motor learning but in discrimination and maze learning as well. This mechanism is contrasted with the more fashionable specific mechanisms which are involved in particular classes of learning; the sensorimotor cortex, for example, would be a component of the specific mechanism underlying motor learning. A subcortical nonspecific learning mechanism may also inhabit the human brain, as suggested by the clinical condition of \"subcortical dementia.\"\r"

Comparisons of the machine's auscultatory and oscillometric modes were made to simultaneously auscultated blood pressures obtained by a physician. Mean differences and standard deviations were calculated. The comparison between automatic auscultatory and manual pressures yielded a mean difference and standard deviation of 1.8 mmHg and 4.2 mmHg for systolic, and -0.8 mmHg and 4.9 mmHg for diastolic pressures. The comparison between automatic oscillometric and manual pressures yielded a mean difference and standard deviation of 2.2 mmHg and 7.1 mmHg for systolic, and -12.7 mmHg and 7.5 mmHg for diastolic. All automatically obtained values except oscillometric diastolic pressure indicate machine accuracy suitable for clinical testing when compared to standards set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation for ideal test conditions. Uncontrolled patient or tubing movement, room noise, and the small subject population may have contributed to the less favorable values. This study suggests that the automatic sphygmomanometer tested is capable of clinically acceptable accuracy in a very dynamic setting.\r"

Data on the number of tender or swollen joints, grip strength, walk time, activities of daily living, psychologic adjustment to illness, and daily activity log, were measured before and three months after intervention. Eleven percent of those who received standard therapy and 50% of those who received the workbook increased their amount of physically active time (p = .10). Twenty-two percent of the control group and 50% of those in the workbook group achieved a better balance of rest and physical activity (p = .07). We conclude that the adoption of energy conservation behaviors is different in the two groups. This initial study suggests that interrupting physical activity with rest periods may result in increased physical activity in patients with RA.\r"

Pearson correlation coefficients for inter- and intraexaminer testing was good for upper extremity test values from 0.85 to 0.99. The variation coefficient of the methodology error (CV) in all upper extremity muscle tests was between 5.1% and 8.3%. These results seemed reliable for clinical muscle strength testing. However, correlation coefficients for lower extremity testing were poor, with values ranging from -0.20 to 0.96. The CV in these tests was much greater than in the upper extremities and ranged from 11.3% to 17.8%. Both break tests also had high CV, with each being greater than 17%. Our results demonstrate that although the dynamometer is reliable for testing upper extremity muscle groups, it is unreliable for testing lower extremity muscle groups. Further work is needed to evaluate muscle strength quantitatively in the clinical setting in an accurate, valid, and reliable manner.\r"

  ".W": "Presented are the description and advantages of a unique compression device in the form of a legging for the treatment of venous and lymphatic insufficiency. It consists of a number of pliable, unyielding, adjustable compression bands, from the knee to the instep. The bands are easily closed, tightened, and opened, which is particularly useful for the physically handicapped patient for whom the commonly prescribed elastic stocking is inappropriate because of the difficulty in putting it on and removing it. The effectiveness of the legging is enhanced by its nonelasticity, as has been long proven by the Unna boot, and its ability to maintain an unreduced compression level throughout its lifetime, regardless of edema changes.\r"
