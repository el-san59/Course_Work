  ".U": "90062433\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic administration of exogenous GH to GH-deficient children is associated with a redistribution of adipose tissue from an abdominal (android) to a more peripheral (gynoid) distribution. We studied abdominal and gluteal sc adipose tissue from seven GH-deficient children 1) before beginning and 2) after 3 months of therapy with exogenous GH (0.1 mg/kg, sc, three times per week). In abdominal and gluteal adipocytes, we measured lipid content and rates of in vitro lipolysis and lipogenesis in response to insulin and various adrenoreceptor agonists. These results were correlated with measures of statural growth and adipose tissue distribution in each subject. We found that GH therapy was associated with a significant reduction in abdominal adipocyte size (0.68 +/- 0.09 micrograms lipid/cell before therapy vs. 0.49 +/- 0.07 after therapy; P less than 0.05), a significant reduction in overall basal rates of lipogenesis (0.43 +/- 0.06 mumol [14C]acylglyceride synthesized/10(6) cells.2 h before therapy vs. 0.27 +/- 0.09 after therapy), and with variable desensitization of abdominal sc adipose tissue to the antilipolytic effect of insulin. The extent of this decrease in insulin action was significantly correlated with changes in abdominal adipocyte lipid content (r = 0.77; P less than 0.05), and with the changes in the anatomical distribution of fat during the study period (r = 0.97; P less than 0.001), as measured by the relative lipid content per adipocyte at each site. We conclude that the site-specific changes in adipose distribution during GH administration are due in part to anatomical site-specific GH-mediated changes in insulin responsiveness of adipose tissue and that exogenous GH therapy is associated with a decrease in de novo triglyceride synthesis in GH-deficient children.\r"

In both sets of stainings the results agreed in 25 of 26 cases (oestrogen receptor: 19 positive, six negative; progesterone receptor: 14 positive, 11 negative). The histoscores of imprint preparations and cryostat sections showed a significant correlation in linear regression analysis (oestrogen receptor: r = 0.755, p less than 0.001; progesterone receptor: r = 0.740, p less than 0.001). Imprint cytology is simple, does not require expensive instruments, and no separate specimen has to be sequestered.

In all, 154 lesions were studied, using antibodies to laminin and type IV collagen and an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. The staining patterns seen with the two antibodies were virtually identical, although that of laminin was generally fainter. Breaks in and thinning of the normally continuous line of type IV collagen and laminin at the dermo-epidermal junction were seen in association with the junctional activity of benign naevi, and in malignant melanomas in association with invasive tumour cells. Both benign and malignant cells of the melanocyte series showed relatively light pericellular staining around individual cells and clusters of cells in the papillary dermis. This staining pattern was much stronger in the deeper reticular dermis. It is concluded that the pattern of staining of these two antibodies and in particular the presence of breaks in type IV collagen and laminin at the dermo-epidermal junction are not specific for either benign or malignant melanocytic lesions and cannot be used as a diagnostic marker of invasive malignancy.\r"

On the basis of cytology alone, of a total of 2362 pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial effusions, 525 cases were diagnosed as positive and 1485 as negative for neoplastic cells, while in 352 (15%) specimens from 307 patients the diagnosis was doubtful. Sections of the embedded sediment of doubtful cases were tested with HMFG2 antibody and proved positive in 215 cases, negative in 108, and inconclusive in 29. The results were checked by following the clinical outcome of the cases. The method was specific in identifying cancer cells in cases at best diagnosed as suspicious on the basis of cytology alone; this represents a clear diagnostic gain. Sensitivity of the test, however, was relatively low (41%). Combined cytological and immunocytochemical characteristics (CEA negative and only some of the neoplastic cells positive with HMFG2 and B72.3 monoclonal antibodies) permitted diagnosis on the effusions of most cases of mesothelioma. The impact of the diagnosis on the progress of the disease was not appreciable as no difference in outcome was noted, irrespective of whether cancer cells had been recognised. The occurrence of an effusion remains an ominous sign in most patients treated for cancer.\r"

Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that this antibody preparation recognised the CD3 antigen on human T lymphoblasts. The antibody stained normal T cells strongly in tissue sections which had been fixed in formalin or Bouin's solution and embedded in paraffin wax. Its reactivity with T cell lymphoma, when evaluated on a series of 96 previously phenotyped cases, closely agreed with the results obtained on cryostat sections. These results indicate that the specific detection of T cells in routinely processed tissue biopsy specimens is now technically feasible on a wide scale in diagnostic laboratories using CD3 peptide antibodies, and they also suggest that in future the use of anti-peptide antibodies may detect other lineage specific antigenic markers in paraffin wax sections.\r"

The APAAP method showed clear distinct labelling of antigen positive cells without loss of antigens due to decalcification. Both normal or reactive single cells present in the sample and neoplastic cell populations could be identified morphologically and their antigenic phenotype and cellular origin, whether lymphoid or myeloid, established. The application of the APAAP method to routinely prepared paraffin wax embedded trephines has many advantages over the assessment of specially prepared cryostat sections of bone marrow.\r"

Along with necropsy specimens, tissue samples of normal looking kidney from 14 nephrectomies were also studied. Two of these specimens turned out to be positive in the immediate immunofluorescence study. To rule out possible false positive staining after death immunofluorescence findings in all nephrectomy specimens were followed up for up to 19 days. The presence of immunoglobulins and complement could be shown for between 12 and 15 days after death; no changes in immunofluorescence findings occurred during this period.

The overall sensitivity of IgA-EMA for the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis was 79% and the specificity was 96%. When the three patients with dermatitis herpetiformis who were faithfully following gluten-free diets were excluded, the sensitivity was 90% and the specificity was 96%. No patient in the bullous disease control group (including patients with linear IgA bullous dermatosis) had circulating IgA-EMA. One patient, who did not have direct immunofluorescence evidence for dermatitis herpetiformis but had IgA nephropathy, had a positive IgA-EMA result, an interesting association in light of the rare reports of dermatitis herpetiformis in patients with IgA nephropathy and IgA antigliadin antibodies associated with IgA nephropathy. Although direct immunofluorescence testing of skin biopsy specimens remains the most definitive diagnostic test for dermatitis herpetiformis, indirect immunofluorescence assay of serum for IgA-EMA is a minimally invasive study with a high sensitivity and specificity for dermatitis herpetiformis.\r"

In this article I review the incidence, bacteriology, clinical spectrum, complications, and treatment of animal and human bite wounds. The spectrum of pathogenic bacteria that cause bite infections is broader than is generally appreciated and includes both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Pasteurella multocida is found in only 20% to 25% of dog bite wounds. In choosing empiric antimicrobial therapy, clinicians must consider the diverse causative bacteria and their characteristic susceptibility patterns. Liberal irrigation and elevation of the injured part are also cornerstones of therapy. Early, aggressive medical and surgical management can minimize, if not prevent, complications.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension is a major public health problem amendable to treatment. Numerous large scale clinical trials have demonstrated that effective, sustained control of elevated arterial pressure to a level below 140/90 mm Hg results in reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Over the past 4 decades antihypertensive drug therapy has evolved from a stepwise, but physiologically rational, selection of agents to specific programs tailored to individualized therapy for specific clinical situations. This evolution has taken place because of a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertensive diseases, the development of new classes of antihypertensive agents that attack specific pressor mechanisms, and the ability to wed these concepts into a rational and specific therapeutic program. Thus, with the currently available spectrum of antihypertensive therapy, we are now able to select treatment for special patient populations utilizing a single agent and, therefore, we can protect the heart, brain and kidneys and maintain organ function without exacerbating associated diseases. These benefits are clear-cut and have resulted in many millions of patients becoming the beneficiaries of this transfer of careful, painstaking and purposeful investigative experiences into clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that prolonged cardiac asystole mimicking an episode of sudden cardiac death may occur as a manifestation of neurally mediated hypotension-bradycardia syndrome. To assess this possibility, electrocardiographic and hemodynamic findings during upright tilt testing were evaluated in six survivors of suspected asystolic sudden cardiac arrest with normal conventional electrophysiologic evaluation (Group I). These observations were compared with findings in two control groups: six patients with syncope but without evident asystole and with normal conventional electrophysiologic evaluation but demonstrable neurally mediated hypotension-bradycardia (Group II), and six patients with syncope in whom conventional electrophysiologic evaluation provided a presumptive diagnosis (Group III). Patients in all three groups ranged in age from 16 to 59 years. During head-up tilt testing (either alone or with isoproterenol infusion), patients in both Groups I and II developed syncope in less than or equal to 5 min, whereas patients in Group III remained asymptomatic. Patients in Groups I and II exhibited a similar tilt-induced decrease in mean arterial pressure (-46 +/- 9 and -40 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively, p = NS) and heart rate (-44 +/- 28 and -49 +/- 12 beats/min, respectively, p = NS). In contrast, patients in Group III manifested only a moderate decrease in mean arterial pressure (-14 +/- 5 mm Hg) and had an increase in heart rate (+14 +/- 8 beats/min). Both mean arterial pressure and heart rate changes in Group I and Group II patients differed significantly (p less than 0.001) from values in Group III patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty subjects without cardiovascular disease (aged 22 to 71 years, mean 41) were studied with use of a new M-mode format integrated backscatter imaging system to characterize the range of cyclic variation of integrated backscatter in normal subjects. Cyclic variation in integrated backscatter was noted in both the septum and the posterior wall in all subjects. The magnitude of the cyclic variation of integrated backscatter and the interval from the onset of the QRS wave of the electrocardiogram to the minimal integrated backscatter value were measured using an area of interest of variable size for integrated backscatter sampling and a software resident in the ultrasound scanner. The magnitude of cyclic variation was larger for the posterior wall than for the septum (6.3 +/- 0.8 versus 4.9 +/- 1.3 dB, p less than 0.01). The interval to the minimal integrated backscatter value was 328 +/- 58 ms for the septum and 348 +/- 42 ms for the posterior wall (p = NS). There was a weak correlation between the magnitude of cyclic variation of integrated backscatter and subject age for the posterior wall (r = -0.47, p less than 0.01), but this was not significant for the septum (r = -0.21) (partially because of inability to exclude specular septal echoes) and septal endocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-two neonates and infants with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect were initially investigated with cross-sectional and spectral Doppler echocardiography and Doppler color flow mapping. All 32 had subsequent correlative angiography. This demonstrated that 24 infants had adequate-sized right and left pulmonary arteries (19 confluent, 5 nonconfluent). Of the five infants with nonconfluent pulmonary arteries, four had bilateral ductus arteriosus and one had a single left-sided ductus with anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta. Nineteen infants had confluent pulmonary arteries, all of which were supplied by a single ductus. Eight infants had complete absence of or inadequate pulmonary arteries; all had multiple aortopulmonary collateral vessels arising from the descending aorta. The presence of adequate-sized right and left pulmonary arteries was correctly predicted in 21 of 24 infants by cross-sectional echocardiography alone and in all 24 by Doppler color flow mapping. Confluence of the right and left pulmonary arteries was predicted by cross-sectional imaging in 14 of the 19 infants in whom it occurred, and by Doppler color flow mapping in all 19 infants. The precise definition of the pulmonary blood supply was correctly predicted by Doppler color flow mapping in 16 of the 19 infants with confluent pulmonary arteries and a single ductus. However, in three infants in this group, Doppler color flow mapping made a false diagnosis of multiple aortopulmonary collateral vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Left ventricular ejection fraction, treadmill exercise tolerance and 48 h electrocardiographic monitoring were assessed before and repeatedly after beginning amiodarone or placebo therapy over 6 months, and side effects were monitored. In patients receiving amiodarone, the ejection fraction increased significantly from 19 +/- 7 to 29 +/- 15% at 6 months (p less than 0.01 from baseline), but not significantly in 14 placebo-treated patients (18 +/- 5 to 22 +/- 9%). Exercise tolerance increased significantly in amiodarone-treated patients (median 433 s to 907 s, p less than 0.05), but not significantly in placebo-treated patients (757 to 918 s). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was present in 88% of amiodarone-treated patients before, but in only 21% of patients after 6 months of treatment (p = 0.06); it was seen in 43% of placebo-treated patients at baseline and in 50% after 6 months. Fifty percent of amiodarone-treated patients had side effects (principally nausea) and the drug was withdrawn in 28% of cases; no life-threatening effects were seen. Low dose amiodarone appears to have a multifaceted potential to produce benefits in arrhythmia control, exercise tolerance and ventricular function in patients with a history of severe congestive heart failure, but better control of side effects (principally nausea) appears essential. Effects on mortality could not be determined from this study; such assessment requires a larger cohort of patients.\r"

The concept that sudden death in human beings is due to ventricular fibrillation was first proposed by MacWilliam exactly 100 years ago, well before the electrocardiogram was invented. To conduct his experimental work, MacWilliam devised methods that laid the foundations for modern cardiac research and that provided the first comprehensive approach to successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He recognized the role of the autonomic nervous system in modulating both the mechanical and the electrical properties of the heart, and was the first to suggest that this effect had a role in the genesis of sudden death. On the centennial of his theory of sudden death, MacWilliam's concepts are reviewed in the context of the effect of Darwinian influence on British physiology. It is suggested that his theorem was based on both sound experimental data and comparative physiology, drawing on the new evolutionary principle of similar structure and function in the hearts of various species. MacWilliam's basic physiologic concepts have survived intact for a century, greatly influencing more than three generations of research and practice in clinical cardiology.\r"

Athymic T-cell deficient nu/nu mice inoculated with intestinal and lymph node tissue filtrates from patients with CD sometimes develop lymphomas and/or lymph node plasma cell hyperplasia. Patients with CD often have an antibody that reacts with an antigen contained in these murine lymphomas and hyperplastic lymph nodes. This antibody is found in the sera of about one-third to one-half of CD patients, but it is rarely found in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and almost never in other controls. This issue of the Journal of Clinical Gastro-enterology contains Das's most recent clinical study on the subject, indicating that this serum antibody was present in 11 of 29 CD patients (38%), in only 4 of 25 UC patients (16%), and in almost no disease controls or normal subjects. Das's immunofluorescent assay is not yet sufficiently sensitive, specific, or convenient to be widely applicable as a routine serodiagnostic tool in clinical practice, but it could be enormously important if it proved in fact to be a marker for a CD-specific antigen. Other laboratories, however, have sharply questioned the specificity of this antigen, whose pathogenetic significance therefore remains controversial.\r"

The immunoreactivity of 86 coded sera from ambulatory patients treated at the Mount Sinai Medical Center were examined-29 from patients with CD, 25 from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 21 from disease controls, and 11 from normal controls. Each serum was tested at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine against lymph nodes from at least two of six nude mice inoculated with CD tissue filtrates or CD filtrate-induced lymphoma.

  ".W": "Current models suggest that Ag undergoes proteolytic cleavage in APC and that resultant peptide fragments associate with class II histocompatibility glycoproteins before recognition by helper T cells. Little direct information is available concerning the physical structure and membrane association of Ag processed under physiologic conditions. A model system, employing a series of biotinylated insulin derivatives, was used to examine the domains of Ag that are presented by APC. We reasoned that avidin should block the response of T cells to a given derivative only if biotin is retained on the functionally relevant form of Ag after processing. By utilizing derivatives modified at selected sites one should be able to determine whether specific sites remain after processing. By using F1 APC pulsed with biotinyl-insulin derivatives modified through the free amino groups of the A1, B1, or B29 amino acids, and T cell hybridomas restricted to I-Ad or I-Ab, we found that avidin inhibited the I-Ad-restricted response to A1, but not B1 or B29 derivatives. By contrast, specific inhibition of the I-Ab-restricted response was observed by using all three derivatives. These results suggest that the processed form of insulin recognized in association with I-Ab is largely intact and includes residues from both chains (A1, B1, and B29). The differential inhibition observed by using T cells restricted to different class II alleles demonstrates that processed Ag associated with I-Ab differs in conformation or structure from that associated with I-Ad. This experimental approach should prove valuable in characterizing the actual structure of processed Ag recognized by T cells.\r"

Each of these cDNA encode a biologically active M-CSF. M-CSF transcripts are expressed in normal fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells, and also in some hematopoietic cells such as monocytes. Normal human cells examined to date express only the 4.0-kb transcript. In contrast, a 3.5-kb M-CSF transcript was continuously expressed in two multiple myeloma cell lines (RPMI 8226 and U266/AF10) and in a bone marrow specimen of a patient with multiple myeloma. The myeloma cell lines secreted biologically active M-CSF.

Similar concentrations of MAggF translocate monocytes and neutrophils through artificial extracellular matrices by a non-chemotactic adhesive process not dependent on intracellular metabolism (matrix-driven translocation). As is the case with matrix-driven translocation mediated by other FN, MAggF-mediated translocation depends on interaction of the lymphokine amino-terminal heparin-binding domain with cell surface heparin-like molecules. In contrast, lymphokine-mediated agglutination involves interactions between the MAggF cell-binding domain and integrin FN receptors recognizing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence. MAggF-mediated translocation and agglutination are also dependent on the lymphokine gelatin-binding domain. The extremely high activity of MAggF in translocating and agglutinating monocytes may result from cooperative interactions between multiple lymphokine domains and multiple classes of cell surface receptor molecules. We suggest that MAggF-mediated matrix-driven translocation could act independently of or in addition to chemotaxis in recruiting monocytes and neutrophils to a tissue site of T cell-mediated inflammation. Subsequent interaction of MAggF and monocyte FN receptor could then detain monocytes there.\r"

The rationale for using this SP complementary peptide (termed SP CP) as an immunogen resulted from the observation that 3H-SP bound to microtiter wells coated with SP CP in a dose dependent and saturable fashion. Furthermore, binding was blocked with excess unlabeled SP or SP antagonist, D-Pro2-D-Phe7-D-Trp9-SP. Inasmuch as the peptide, SP CP, specifically bound 3H-SP, we hypothesized that antibodies against this peptide might recognize a SP receptor binding site. Using the SP receptor positive lymphoblast cell line, IM-9, affinity-purified antibodies against SP CP but not antibodies against keyhole limpet hemocyanin recognized a molecule on the surface of IM-9 cells. Anti-SP CP binding to IM-9 cells was blocked with excess SP antagonist, suggesting that the antibody and the SP antagonist were competing for the same binding site. In support of this possibility, anti-SP CP antibodies blocked 3H-SP binding to IM-9 cells. An immunoaffinity column coupled with antibodies against SP CP bound protein from solubilized IM-9 cells. This isolated protein bound 125I-Tyr8-SP and binding was specifically blocked with SP as well as by SP antagonist, neurokinin A, and eledoisin. Passthrough material did not bind SP suggesting that a SP receptor had been purified. Western blot analysis of solubilized IM-9 cell proteins using anti-SP CP antibodies but not preimmune IgG recognized a single protein of 58,000 D. Taken together, these results demonstrate that antibodies against SP CP recognize a SP receptor present on the lymphocyte cell line, IM-9.\r"

Rodent cells established with the highly oncogenic human adenovirus type 12 exhibit greatly reduced levels of class I Ag compared with cells derived with the nononcogenic adenovirus type 5. By using seven independently derived adenovirus-transformed cell lines, we have investigated the mechanism responsible for down-regulation of class I RNA expression. In all adenovirus 12-transformed cells examined, class I RNA suppression was the result of a block in transcription initiation. Highly oncogenic cell lines derived from a spontaneous melanoma and a chemically induced sarcoma also showed greatly reduced transcription of class I genes. We conclude that suppression of MHC class I RNA in a variety of highly oncogenic cells results largely from a substantial decrease in transcription initiation.\r"

In each subject there were fewer polymorphonuclear leukocytes and less endothelial cell prominence and vessel wall necrosis in the UVA tanned skin than in the untanned UVA-irradiated skin. In the tanned control and tanned UVA-irradiated skin there was a prominent mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate that was much greater than in untanned skin. In immunoperoxidase stained tissue sections, the mononuclear cells were predominantly T cells, and in all of the specimens the number of phenotypic helper/inducer cells exceeded the phenotypic cytotoxic/suppressor cells. This demonstrates that a UVA tan provides photoprotection against acute UVA exposure. In addition, tanning, with or without further UVA-irradiation, was associated with a mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate.\r"

Thus, we examined cross-reactivities of 20 murine monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies with normal human and mouse skin tissues. Hybridomas producing these monoclonal antibodies were established from non-immunized spleen cells from autoimmune MRL-lpr/lpr mice, a strain characterized by spontaneous development of SLE-like disorders including skin changes. They were selected based on their reactivity to DNA in a typical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in which nine monoclonal antibodies were reactive with both double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA, whereas nine monoclonals were reactive only with single-stranded DNA. Even though only seven of them were observed to stain nuclei, most of the monoclonal antibodies revealed strong and distinct cross-reactivities to various components of the skin tissues including the epidermal basement membrane, keratinocytes at different locations of the epidermis, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, Thy-1+ dendritic cells in the case of murine skin, and mast cells. Our results suggest a possible role of so-called anti-DNA antibodies with high or low affinities to DNA in the pathogenesis of cutaneous lesions of lupus erythematosus.\r"

  ".U": "90063117\r", 
  ".W": "Various T-cell surface molecules are involved in T-cell adhesion, which is an essential requirement for epidermotropic migration of T cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that certain T-cell clones can migrate into the epidermis upon their intradermal inoculation into the footpads of recipient mice with relevant antigens, while other T-cell clones, despite their identical antigen specificities and functions, are non-epidermotropic. We therefore tested whether the differences in epidermotropism of these T cells could reside in the different levels of expression of T-cell surface molecules such as CD3, CD4, CD2, and lymphocyte function associated antigen 1 (LFA 1). The results of flow cytometric analysis showed that LFA-1 was preferentially expressed on the surface of epidermotropic T-cell clones, while non-epidermotropic T-cell clones were negative or very weakly positive for LFA-1 with one exception. After exposure to phorbol ester, epidermotropic clones with high levels of LFA-1 did not show any further up-regulation of LFA-1. In contrast, under identical conditions, significant up-regulation of LFA-1 was observed on non-epidermotropic T cells with low levels of LFA-1. However, even after exposure to phorbol ester, these T cells remained non-epidermotropic. These results suggest that the presence of high levels of LFA-1 on T cells is absolutely necessary for their epidermotropic migration, but its up-regulation is neither necessary nor sufficient to trigger the epidermotropic migration. High levels of LFA-1, regardless of cell activation, may be required to mediate stable cell adhesions leading to epidermotropic migration.\r"

To evaluate the amount and character of the filaria-specific antibodies in the lungs in this disorder, bronchoalveolar lavage was carried out in individuals with acute TPE, in normal subjects, and in patients with elephantiasis or asthma. Striking elevations of total IgE were found in the lower respiratory tract epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of patients with TPE along with high levels of filarial-specific IgG, IgM, and IgE. When patients with acute TPE were treated with diethylcarbamazine and evaluated again 6-14 d later, there was marked reduction in ELF parasite-specific IgG and IgE, which paralleled a rapid clinical response. Immunoblot comparison of the antigen recognition patterns of ELF and serum antibodies demonstrated a general similarity in parasite antigens recognized, but the lung IgE and IgG antibodies appeared to recognize only a certain subset of the parasite antigens recognized by serum antibodies. Thus, a profound antibody response to filarial infection is found in the lungs of patients with TPE, suggesting that these filaria-specific antibodies play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\r"

The index patient, a diabetic woman with recurrent Escherichia coli bacteriuria on prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) therapy, was hospitalized with concurrent E. coli urinary tract infection and shigellosis. Both E. coli isolated from her urine and S. flexneri isolated from her stool were resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and TMP/SMZ. Both isolates contained a 35-MDa plasmid transferrable to recipient E. coli, and transconjugates acquiring the plasmid from either donor strain also acquired resistance to the same agents. The number and size of fragments generated by plasmid digestion with DNA restriction endonuclease ClaI were similar. A review of clinical microbiology records showed that an E. coli strain isolated from the patient 3 w before the onset of shigellosis had identical antimicrobial resistance to the E. coli and Shigella isolated during the outbreak. These studies indicate that the index patient receiving prophylactic TMP/SMZ was the likely source of the R-plasmid for the outbreak strain of Shigella.\r"

Clinically uninfected seropositive infants with declining HIV antibody titers and infants who became seronegative lacked an enzymatically amplified HIV gene product.

Thirteen plasmid patterns were observed among the 88 tested isolates; four patterns accounted for 82% of the isolates. Genetic probing for Shiga-like toxins (SLT) I and II demonstrated the presence of both genes in 67 (76%), SLT I alone in three (3%), and SLT II alone in 18 (20%). The hemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura developed in seven (39%) of 18 patients infected with isolates having only the SLT II gene, while these complications occurred in only four (6%) of 70 patients infected with isolates having the other two genotypes (relative risk, 6.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.9, 26.4). This study shows that E. coli O157:H7 isolates systematically collected from a single geographic region over a defined time period exhibit considerable diversity in plasmid content and toxin genotype and that the toxin genotype of the infecting strain may influence the risk of developing microangiopathic sequelae.\r"

Some problems are unavoidable. The potential risks of surgery and its complications should be carefully weighed against the natural history of the pathological process and a realistic expectation of the surgical outcome compared with alternative treatments. Other problems may result from genuine mistakes, but a number of complications are caused through actions or omissions which are avoidable and which in certain circumstances may be construed as professional negligence. Some of the more common pitfalls and complications in head and neck surgery are discussed with particular reference to their causation and possible avoidance.\r"

They are the primary source for the generation and maintenance of cellular diversity and tissue homeostasis. In general, neoplasms manifest differentiation pathways similar to those found in the development and renewal of the normal tissues from which they arise. This feature serves as a basis for classification schemes of neoplasms and, as in the normal tissues, there is usually an inverse correlation between proliferative capacity and differentiation within the neoplasms. In our postulate of the histogenesis of salivary gland neoplasia, we evoke the stem cell model to account for the considerable phenotypic heterogeneity seen with these neoplasms. We further consider the neoplasms and, in particular, their myoepithelial constituencies to be manifestations of escape from normal regulatory mechanisms that determine differentiation pathways which a stem cell and its progeny can take. Clinical and basic scientific evidence are presented to support the postulate and also to point to the mitigating role that myoepithelial differentiation has in the biological course of salivary gland neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "The Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias (POSCH) is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center, secondary, atherosclerosis intervention trial. POSCH addresses the therapeutic arm of the lipid-atherosclerosis theory, i.e. whether lowering of plasma cholesterol is directly related to a reduction in atherosclerosis risk. In this trial, lipid modification is accomplished by the partial ileal bypass operation. Between 1975 and 1983, 838 patients were randomized into this study. All patients were between 30 and 64 years of age, had survived one and only one electrocardiogram and enzyme-documented myocardial infarction, and had a total plasma cholesterol of at least 220 mg/dl or a low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol of at least 140 mg/dl if the total plasma cholesterol was between 200 and 219 mg/dl after a minimum of 6 weeks of dietary fat and cholesterol restriction. The primary response variable in POSCH is overall mortality. Secondary endpoints include fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions, serial electrocardiographic changes, and, most importantly, sequential coronary arteriography changes. The minimum follow-up is currently planned to be 7 years. Study analyses will be made primarily on the \"intention to treat\" basis. This paper is the first detailed presentation of POSCH design and methodology. Included are descriptions of study design, implementation, and data collection, including data processing, quality assurance/quality surveillance, and patient safety monitoring. POSCH seeks to demonstrate a significant reduction in overall mortality by lipid modification and to validate the use of coronary arteriographic change as a surrogate endpoint for change in coronary heart disease risk.\r"

Clinical impressions suggest that caring for an older person suffering from a dementing disorder may lead to physical and mental health problems for the caregiver. A critical review of the research literature on this topic was carried out. The review revealed that a multitude of physical and mental health outcomes as well as numerous correlates of health problems have been studied in relation to caregiving. Furthermore, several methodological problems were identified in the studies reviewed: inadequate sample size, unrepresentative study samples, uncontrolled confounding factors, inappropriate study design, multidimensional outcome measures, and absence of comparison groups. The diversity of outcomes studied and the numerous methodological problems make it difficult to make statements about the causal effect of caregiving on health, or to assess the public health impact of caring for a demented elderly person. Nevertheless, the work done to date suggests interesting directions for future research.\r"

Eighteen relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's disease patients who received cyclophosphamide at 1.5 g/m2/day (days -6 to -3), carmustine (BCNU) at 300 mg/m2 (day -6), and etoposide (VP-16) at 125 mg/m2 every 12 hours (days -6 to -4), followed by ABMT (day 0) were treated with rhG-CSF at 60 micrograms/kg/day for a maximum of 28 days beginning on day 1. rhG-CSF dosage was gradually diminished and stopped once an adequate granulocyte count was maintained. rhG-CSF significantly accelerated absolute granulocyte count (AGC) compared with historical controls recovery to the 100/microL level (median, 9 days v 13 days; P = .103 x 10(-4), 500/microL level (median, 13 days v 22 days; P = 0.189 x 10(-2), and 1000/microL level (median, 16 days v 30 days levels; P = .125 x 10(-5). Platelet recovery to 50,000/microL was not significantly altered (P = .370). rhG-CSF was well tolerated, bone pain and myalgia being the only side effects noted. rhG-CSF hastens granulocyte recovery after high-dose chemotherapy with ABMT in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's disease without significant toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCSG) CCG-160 protocol series was designed to evaluate prognostic factors in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients were assigned to one of three prognostic groups based upon initial WBC count and age. To determine the optimal duration of therapy, CCG-160 patients completing 2 years of treatment in continuous remission were randomized (\"late randomization\") to discontinue therapy or receive another year of maintenance therapy. The prognostic significance of early response to induction therapy, as measured by the percentage of lymphoblasts in the day-14 bone marrow (d14 BM) aspirate, was evaluated in 2,516 children. For 1,490 patients with complete data, the status of the d 14 BM was a highly significant predictor of disease-free survival (DFS) by univariate and multivariate analysis (P less than .0001). The observed/expected (O/E) failure rate in patients with d14 M1 (less than 5% blasts), M2 (4% to 25% blasts), or M3 (greater than 25% blasts) BM rating who were subsequently M1 on day 28 or day 42, was .87, 1.59, and 2.30, respectively (P less than .0001). Patients with M2 or M3 d14 BM were more likely to have L2 ALL (modified French-American-British [FAB] morphologic classification), P less than .001. The significance of the d14 BM rating persisted after correction was made for WBC count and clinical prognostic groups using current CCSG criteria, except in infants less than 12 months of age. The d14 BM was also the most significant predictor of DFS in 975 patients after late randomization at 2 years following diagnosis. The O/E failure rate in patients with d14 M1, M2, or M3 BM was .88, 1.78, and 2.02, respectively (P = .0002, trend). Other significant predictors of late relapse were prognostic groups (P = .0003, trend) and initial WBC count (P = .004, trend). Predictive for both early and late relapse of ALL, early response should be monitored closely and alternative treatment regimens should be considered for slow responders.\r"

Histopathologic peer review of all the specimens was performed by an expert pathology committee. The most common soft tissue sarcoma after review was malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) (40%), followed by synovial sarcoma (15%), leiomyosarcoma (9%), liposarcoma (8%), and malignant Schwannoma (6%). In 25% of the cases the histologic type of sarcoma was reclassified, and in 40% of the cases the malignancy grade was changed. By survival analyses, the reclassification of malignancy grade seemed to be valid. Also, grading highly malignant soft tissue sarcoma in two grades (III and IV) increased the prognostic information. Of 164 tumors from the centers with the most reported cases (five centers with 25 to 51 tumors each), eight tumors were found to be ineligible for the adjuvant study (5%); of 76 tumors from 13 centers with few tumors (one to 16 tumors per center), 12 tumors were ineligible (16%). We conclude that histologic peer review is important in studies of soft tissue sarcoma.\r"

Patients received alpha-IFN at a dose of 3 x 10(6) U/m2 in conjunction with IL-2 at doses of either 1 x 10(6) U/m2 (six patients), 3 x 10(6) U/m2 (32 patients), or 4.5 x 10(6) U/m2 (26 patients). Thirty patients received alpha-IFN at 6 x 10(6) U/m2 plus IL-2 at 4.5 x 10(6) U/m2. Patients each received cytokine as an intravenous bolus infusion every 8 hours for up to 5 consecutive days and after a 10-day rest received a second cycle of combination cytokines. Of the 91 patients evaluable for response, seven patients had a complete regression of cancer, and 18 had a partial regression. At the four increasing dose levels used in patients with renal cell cancer (35 patients) or melanoma (39 patients), objective responses were seen in 17% (of six patients), 24% (of 25 patients), 38% (of 16 patients), and 41% (of 27 patients), respectively. Of the 25 total responding patients, 16 are still responding 5 to 14 months after treatment. The toxicities associated with the combined administration of IL-2 and alpha-IFN were similar to those expected from each agent alone. There was one treatment-related death in the 94 patients treated in this study. Thus, using increasing doses of the combination of IL-2 and alpha-IFN, it appears that response rates may be related to the doses of the cytokines used, and that at the highest doses of these combination cytokines, response rates may be higher than those for either cytokine alone. A prospective randomized trial comparing the cytokine combinations with each cytokine administered alone is necessary as is the extension of this combination cytokine treatment to patients with other types of solid cancer.\r"

We used this equation to dose patients receiving carboplatin (day 1) and etoposide (80 mg/m2 days 1 to 3). An initial cohort of 14 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated with 75% of the calculated dose of carboplatin (29 evaluable courses) as a precaution against added myelosuppression from combination chemotherapy. The observed reduction in platelets was essentially equal to the reduction in platelets predicted if patients had received carboplatin alone. Subsequently, a second cohort of 20 evaluable patients with NSCLC received the full calculated dose of carboplatin and etoposide (51 evaluable courses). There was a linear relationship between observed (o) and predicted (p) reductions in platelets. With full-dose carboplatin in combination with etoposide, there was a significantly greater carboplatin dosage administered, greater reduction in platelets, and lower platelet nadir. Among 34 evaluable patients (80 courses) there was one complete response (CR) and four partial responses (PRs) for an overall response rate of 15% (90% confidence +/- 9%). The median duration of survival for responders was 336+ days and for nonresponders was 204+ days. Therapy was well tolerated. This study, in addition, supports our concept of individualized dosing of carboplatin and the underlying pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships and represents an interesting pharmacodynamic and quantitative approach to studying potential drug-drug interactions and defining appropriate dosages for combination chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Immunotoxins are a new class of antitumor agents consisting of tumor-selective ligands (generally monoclonal antibodies [MoAbs]) linked to highly toxic protein molecules that have been modified to remove their normal tissue-binding domains. These immuno-conjugates combine the potency of the parent toxin with the specificity of the attached ligand. Toxins used in the construction of immunotoxins belong to a group of peptides that catalytically inhibit the elongation step of protein synthesis, and include ricin, abrin, pokeweed antiviral protein, gelonin, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, diptheria toxin, and alpha-sarcin. To synthesize immunotoxins, the normal cell-binding function must be removed by chemical cleavage or modification, or in the case of toxins that have been cloned, genetic engineering used to delete amino acids critical to cell binding. Covalent linkage of toxin to ligand generally involves a disulfide or thioether bond, though recently, recombinant toxin molecules with ligands that are genetically engineered into the protein have been made. The most successful clinical application of immunotoxins has been in the depletion of T cells from allogeneic bone marrow grafts to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Clinical trials have been conducted using immunotoxins for the systemic treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), GVHD, and selected solid tumors. With the possible exception of GVHD, responses have been limited. Obstacles have included rapid systemic clearance, poor delivery to extravascular tumor deposits, and humoral immune responses to the immunotoxin. Research to overcome these problems is in progress and should lead to a better definition of the role of immunotoxins in the therapy of malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy of quantitative gamma camera renography in predicting outcome of treatment was assessed in 31 patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Glomerular filtration rate, renal perfusion, relative renal function, and mean parenchymal transit time were calculated before and after treatment (renal artery angioplasty or vascular surgery). Patients were also assessed during the follow-up period of up to 6 years. On the pre-treatment study, nine patients did not have prolongation of parenchymal transit time in the kidney on the side of the renal artery stenosis. Despite technically successful angioplasties, none of these patients showed a significant reduction in blood pressure or improvement in renal function. Twenty-two patients had prolongation of parenchymal transit time in the affected kidney. Three suffered complications of treatment, and the remaining 19 showed improvement in blood pressure control, reduction in parenchymal transit time, and improvement in relative renal function. Quantitative renography accurately predicted those patients who improved following intervention for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. On progress evaluation, patients with recurrent stenoses were easily identified.\r"

In this patient, the routine [99mTc]diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal scintigraphy without Captopril was normal and the subsequent study with Captopril showed a marked decrease in glomerular filtration rate of the right kidney alone. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the functionally affected right kidney immediately evoked new renin-dependent hypertension caused by the untreated left RAS. This patient illustrates two major points: (a) as a diagnostic tool, the sensitivity of Captopril renal scintigraphy may be compromised by an inability to detect bilateral RAS, but (b) after angioplasty, it can be useful for evaluating the treated kidney and in revealing contralateral disease that may benefit from angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "The levels and fatty acid composition of lipids were determined in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL, d less than 1.006), yolk and abdominal adipose tissue of normal (Dw) and sex-linked dwarf (dw) White Leghorn laying hens. Effects of adding 4% tallow to the diet were also examined. In 40-wk-old hens, neither plasma lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids and cholesterol), VLDL levels, nor the chemical composition of VLDL was altered by the dw gene or dietary fat. Dwarfism reduced egg and yolk weights. Though the yolk lipid content was similar in normal and dwarf hens, yolk from dwarfs had slightly more phospholipids and less triglycerides than yolk from normal hens. Higher linoleic acid [18:2(n-6)] and lower oleic acid [18:1(n-9)] levels were observed in triglycerides of VLDL, yolk and adipose tissue from dwarf hens. In addition, the dietary fatty acid pattern had a greater influence on the fatty acid composition of the yolk lipid major precursors (VLDL triglycerides) in dwarf laying hens than in normal hens. These results suggest that the dwarfing gene might reduce the hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis and/or dwarf hens might incorporate more dietary lipids into yolk than do normal hens.\r"

  ".W": "The storage capacity for plasma triglyceride in abdominal adipose tissue has been investigated in two lines of chickens selected for either high or low adiposity (fat line and lean line, respectively). Adipose tissue cellularity and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity were estimated in 2- and 5-wk-old birds. In 2-wk-old birds, cellularity and LPL and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity were evaluated in the stromavascular fraction. At both ages studied, the fat line exhibited a twofold increase in mature fat cell number and a marked hypertrophy. LPL activity per cell did not differ with genotype, regardless of the nutritional state; however, LPL activity per whole fat pad was higher in fat birds. In 2-wk-old fat chickens, the stromavascular fraction was characterized by an increase in cell number and a decrease in LPL activity, while GPDH was unchanged. Finally, adipocyte hyperplasia in the fat line appeared to reflect an excessive proliferation of precursor cells. The higher LPL activity in fat birds resulted mainly from cell hyperplasia, rather than from a greater intrinsic activity of adipocytes. Consequently, enhanced fatty acid uptake by adipose tissue represents a major factor in determination of adiposity in the chicken.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to examine the effect of dietary fat composition on the structure of colon mucosal plasma membranes and fecal lipids. Rats were fed a purified diet containing 14% of either highly saturated fat (beef fat or butterfat) or highly polyunsaturated oil (safflower) in addition to 2% corn oil for 4 wk. Colon mucosal membranes were prepared and examined for lipid composition and protein pattern. Saturated fatty acid feeding resulted in the loss of some protein bands from plasma membranes compared to feeding polyunsaturated fatty acids. Within the saturated fatty acid--rich fats, feeding beef fat caused a greater loss than did feeding butterfat. Dietary fat composition had no effect on membrane content of phospholipid and cholesterol. Saturated fatty acid feeding resulted in an increase in the percentage of 18:1 in plasma membrane lipids compared to feeding safflower oil. The observed changes in the structure of colon mucosal membrane of animals fed the saturated fats were associated with an increase in fecal free fatty acids. There was a 4-fold and 2-fold increase in fecal free fatty acids with feeding the beef fat and butterfat diets, respectively, compared to the safflower oil diet. Alterations in fecal bile acid and free fatty acid composition were also noticed with feeding saturated fatty acids. The results obtained suggest that feeding saturated fatty acids as the main source of fat in the diet could influence the structure of colon mucosa, and this could be mediated through fecal free fatty acids.\r"

Plasma PLP, tryptophan-load test results, food intake, and tissue and body weights were not different at wk 6. Red blood cell endogenous alanine aminotransferase activity and PLP concentration were elevated (P less than 0.01) in rats fed 1400 mg PN.HCl/kg diet. In contrast, PLP concentration in muscle was significantly lower (P = 0.01) in rats fed excess vitamin B-6 (9.7 +/- 0.8 nmol/g, mean +/- SEM) than in controls (14.9 +/- 1.4). PLP concentration in other tissues, including plasma, was not affected. In rats fed excess vitamin B-6, pyridoxal was increased in all tissues examined (P less than 0.05), and total vitamin B-6 was increased in plasma, red blood cells and kidneys (P less than 0.05). Total glycogen phosphorylase (a + b) activity in the gastrocnemius was not affected, but phosphorylase a activity was increased in rats fed excess vitamin B-6 (P = 0.025). Concentrations of dopamine and metabolites in the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia were not affected. A transient, but significant, elevation in acoustic startle response, a central nervous system reflex, was observed in rats fed excess vitamin B-6. The depletion in muscle PLP could not hae been predicted by either plasma or red blood cell PLP concentration, although the latter did reflect vitamin B-6 intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Experiment 1 involved adding iron to meat slurries followed by in vitro digestion using pepsin and then pancreatin. Pepsin and pancreatin were excluded from incubation mixtures used as the nondigested treatment. Ferric iron in aqueous solution was used as an iron-only control. Dialyzable iron for each treatment was determined by measuring iron able to cross a dialysis membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of 6,000-8,000. Soluble iron was determined as that iron remaining in solution after centrifugation at 2,500 x g for 15 min. No differences (P greater than 0.05) in dialyzable iron were observed between treatments. However, soluble iron in the digested meat treatments was greater than soluble iron in the nondigested treatments (P = 0.05) or iron-only controls (P = 0.01). There was no difference (P greater than 0.05) between nondigested and iron-only treatments. In experiment 2, meat components were first separated by dialysis from digested or nondigested meat. The pH of the isolated components was adjusted to 2.0, iron added, and the pH adjusted to 7.0. Dialyzable and soluble iron were then determined. As in experiment 1, no differences (P greater than 0.05) in dialyzable iron among treatments were observed. Dialyzable components from digested or nondigested meat increased soluble iron as compared to the iron-only control (P = 0.01), with soluble iron values for the nondigested treatment being greater (P = 0.01) than for the digested treatment. Thus, meat contains a factor(s) that solubilizes iron independent of proteolytic digestion.\r"

The diets fed provided ratios of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (P/S ratios) representative of those consumed by the human population and ranging from 0.14 to 1.80. The dietary P/S ratio fed altered the essential and nonessential fatty acid composition of plasma membrane phospholipids. Diet-induced alterations in membrane phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine composition were found to be related in a dose-dependent manner to insulin binding at both physiological and supraphysiological insulin concentrations. This observation further supports in vivo a dietary mechanism for modulating insulin action. The present study establishes that the effect of diet on the relationship between membrane composition and insulin binding reaches a plateau within the physiological range of dietary P/S ratios.\r"

Three groups of 28 rats each were fed a basal diet providing either 3 mg Zn/kg for the zinc-deficient group (-Zn) or 40 mg Zn/kg for ad libitum-fed and pair-fed controls. After 6 wk each group was divided into two equal subgroups and infected with either 1000 or 4000 infective Nb larvae/rat. The -Zn rats showed significant reductions (P less than 0.001) in food intake, weight gain and food conversion efficiency when compared to the rats fed ad libitum but not when compared to the pair-fed controls. Plasma zinc concentration in the -Zn rats (0.50 microgram/ml) was significantly lower than in both ad libitum-fed (1.33 micrograms/ml) and pair-fed (1.45 micrograms/ml) controls (P less than 0.001). The recovery of worms from the rats 3, 7 and 12 d postinfection was similar for the corresponding day and dose of infection in all groups. Expulsion was almost complete in all groups by 12 d post-infection. There were no significant differences in size and fecundity of worms recovered from the different groups of rats on 7 d postinfection. However, over the whole period of infection, the -Zn rats excreted significantly more parasite eggs than did controls (P less than 0.001). These results indicate that although zinc deficiency affected growth performance of the rats, it did not affect the establishment or expulsion of Nb. Impairment of the immune response of the zinc-deficient rat was manifested only by a significant increase in the number of parasite eggs excreted in feces.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that physicians in private practice who receive a continuing education program (entitled \"Quit for Life\") about how to counsel smokers to quit would counsel smokers more effectively and have higher rates of long-term smoking cessation among their patients. DESIGN: Randomized trial with blinded assessment of principal outcomes. SETTING: Private practices of internal medicine and family practice. SUBJECTS: Forty-four physicians randomly assigned to receive training (24) or serve as controls (20) and consecutive samples of smokers visiting each physician (19.6 patients per experimental and 22.3 per control physician). INTERVENTIONS: Physicians received three hours of training about how to help smokers quit. Physicians and their office staffs were also given self-help booklets to distribute to smokers and were urged to use a system of stickers on charts as reminders to counsel smokers about quitting. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Based on telephone interviews with patients, physicians in the experimental group were more likely to discuss smoking with patients who smoked (64% vs. 44%), spent more time counseling smokers about quitting (7.5 vs. 5.2 minutes), helped more smokers set dates to quit smoking (29% vs. 5% of smokers), gave out more self-help booklets (37% vs. 9%), and were more likely to make a follow-up appointment about quitting smoking (19% vs. 11% of those counseled) than physicians in the control group. One year later, the rates of biochemically confirmed, long-term (greater than or equal to 9 months) abstinence from smoking were similar among patients in the experimental (3.2%) and control (2.5%) groups (95% confidence interval for the 0.7% difference: -1.7 to +3.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that this continuing education program substantially changed the way physicians counseled smokers, but had little or no impact on rates of long-term smoking cessation among their patients. There is a need for more effective strategies to help physicians help their patients to quit smoking.\r"

The study was balted at the midpoint because of inadequate patient recruitment, primarily a consequence of medical illnesses that prevented more than 80% of eligible patients from participating in or completing the clinical trial. Major or minor medical contraindications to the use of antidepressants were present in over 90% of depressed patients. Short-term follow-up was conducted on untreated depressed patients, those receiving antidepressants at the time of assessment, and those in whom antidepressant treatment was initiated after assessment. Non-randomized exposure to antidepressants did not predict remission of depression at follow-up due to spontaneous remission in the untreated group. Given the prevalence of medical contraindications to antidepressant use among depressed elderly patients and the problems with side effects in treated patients, there were few depressed, elderly hospitalized patients who were candidates for antidepressant therapy.\r"

One side of each anatomic site received a dense block of hydroxylapatite (HA) implant, and the contralateral side received an equivalent-sized block of porous HA implant. Monkeys were killed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and the implants were manually tested for mobility. The implants were then retrieved in block specimens. Half of each specimen was decalcified, embedded in paraffin, and stained. The other half was embedded in plastic, and sections were stained or carbon coated for scanning electron microscope histometry. The dense HA implants showed complete fibrous encapsulation and they popped out when cut in half. The porous HA implants were attached to the underlying cortex by bone ingrowth. The porous implant volume sampled within 2.5 mm of underlying cortex contained 33.0% HA matrix and 35.7% bone. The surface area of the porous HA matrix (4.8 mm2/mm3) was 54.3% covered by bone ingrowth. It is hypothesized that micromotion may have accounted for the lack of osseointegration of the dense HA specimens. In contrast, the early ingrowth of fibrous tissue into the porous HA block might be responsible for reducing micromotion to levels acceptable for ingrowth of bone. The contrasting biologic response of implant sites to two variants of the same implant material supports the value of comparative studies to permit informed surgical selection decisions.\r"

  ".W": "The development of renal scarring was analyzed prospectively in 241 boys with their first known episode of symptomatic urinary tract infection (140 acute pyelonephritis, 61 acute cystitis, and 40 nonspecific). Of 197 boys undergoing urography, 22 (11%) had scars; 20 were in the pyelonephritis group. Vesicoureteral reflux occurred in 81% of those with scarring, compared with 20% of those without scarring. The bacteria causing the first episode of urinary tract infection in each patient were saved, and Escherichia coli organisms were characterized for the expression of both galactose-alpha (1----4)galactose-beta (Gal-Gal)-specific adhesins and pap homologous DNA. Scarring occurred in 41% and other renal abnormalities in 11% of boys infected with bacteria that did not bind Gal-Gal (Gal-Gal negative), compared with 5% and 1%, respectively, in those infected with Gal-Gal-binding strains (Gal-Gal-positive) (relative risk 8.3; 95% confidence limits 3.3 to 20.4; p less than 0.001). That boys infected with Gal-Gal-negative strains more often had reflux did not explain the increased risk for renal scarring in this group. The possibility that the phenotypically negative strains could be induced to express Gal-Gal adhesions in vivo was excluded by dot blot analysis, which showed the absence of pap homologous DNA in all but one of the Gal-Gal-negative strains. The results suggest that the absence of Gal-Gal-specific adhesins in E. coli can be used as an indicator of risk for renal scarring and the need for radiologic examination.\r"

  ".U": "90064006\r", 
  ".W": "To determine whether dexamethasone therapy altered the outcome of chronic lung disease in neonates, we conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-one 30-day-old oxygen- and ventilator-dependent infants were enrolled. The mean (+/- SD) birth weight was 808.1 +/- 141 gm and the mean gestational age was 26.0 +/- 1.5 weeks. There were 17 black and 12 male infants. Twelve received placebo and nine received dexamethasone. Neither severity of early illness, birth weight, gestational age, age when treated, gender and race distribution, nor frequency of diuretic therapy differed significantly between groups. The age at extubation, 57.2 days (placebo) versus 39.4 days (steroid), was significantly different. The average oxygen requirements of the steroid-treated patients was significantly lower than for placebo-treated patients during the first 10 days of treatment. There were no differences for placebo-versus steroid-treated patients in age when weaned to room air (95.5 days vs 74.9 days), age at discharge (119 days vs 111 days), or number of deaths (2 (17%) vs 1 (11%]. Dexamethasone therapy was associated with a significantly increased incidence of hyperglycemia (89% vs 8%) but did not influence the incidence of hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, infection, or retinopathy of prematurity. The steroid-treated patients had a significant delay in weight gain during the first 3 weeks of treatment but recovered by discharge. Our results suggest that dexamethasone produces acute improvement in infants with lung disease but no long-term effect on mortality rate, duration of oxygen requirement or age at discharge.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effect of salbutamol and placebo in a double-blind study of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, using a randomized, crossover design with several replicates per subject. Sixty-two tests were performed on 20 ventilator-dependent infants weighing less than 1500 gm. Patients were entered as early as the first week of life and studied for at least 4 weeks or until extubation. Each subject was his own control subject and was randomly assigned to a placebo-salbutamol or salbutamol-placebo sequence administered on 2 consecutive days of each week. Static compliance, expiratory resistance of the respiratory system, and changes in transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide tension were measured. Static compliance improved by 0.240 ml/cm H2O/kg (35.3%) after salbutamol and by 0.010 ml/cm H2O/kg (2.8%) after placebo (p less than 0.0001). The presence of a predetermined decrease in carbon dioxide tension correlated with large changes in static compliance per kilogram and with the need for a high level of fractional inspired oxygen. The magnitude of the clinical and physiologic improvement observed, and the early response suggest that long-term bronchodilator therapy starting as early as the second week of life may be beneficial for very low birth weight infants with early bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\r"

These treatments have implications for emotional processing; some factors can increase the likelihood of impaired coping. Specific ways of dealing with the psychologic needs of infertile couples at all stages of their treatment can be helpful.\r"

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been found consistently to be more useful than a placebo or acetaminophen. As compared with aspirin, the newer NSAIDs had a more delayed onset of action but required fewer doses. Mild analgesics were usually all that was necessary, and a combination with codeine was usually unnecessary. Side effects and breast milk concentrations of the drugs were negligible for this short-term therapy. Although no drug was found to be preferable to the others, aspirin and ibuprofen were the least expensive.\r"

The risk of uterine rupture due to overstimulation is higher when amnioinfusion with prostaglandin or hypertonic saline is combined with the use of other oxytocic drugs. Grand multiparas undergoing amnioinfusion should not be given oxytocin; in the rare cases in which oxytocin is needed, it should be administered cautiously and monitored continuously. When a supplemental agent, such as an oxytocic, is needed, it should not be started until several hours after the amnioinfusion.\r"

Sera of patients with JRA with iridocyclitis were compared to sera from patients with JRA with and without antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and healthy children. An increased frequency of antibody to the human iris was seen with sera of patients with JRA with iridocyclitis compared to healthy children's sera. A higher frequency of antibody was also noted to human retina in sera of patients with JRA with iridocyclitis compared to patients without ANA and healthy children. No increased frequency of antibody was detected to ciliary body. Sera of 7 patients with JRA with iridocyclitis were also compared during a time of inactive eye disease to a time of active disease. No difference in binding to eye tissue was detected at times of inactive disease compared to controls.

The increasing availability of recombinant DNA probes that detect various proto-oncogenes, growth factor genes, and growth factor receptor genes, as well as restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the human population, have made possible a molecular approach for the identification of frequently occurring mutations in primary human breast tumor DNA. The aim of studies using this molecular approach has been to investigate whether specific mutations are highly associated with various clinical parameters, including disease prognosis. Eight mutations have been identified, including amplification of c-myc, c-erbB2, and int-2, as well as loss of heterozygosity on five chromosomes (1q, 3p, 11p, 13q, and 17p). Loss of heterozygosity is thought to unmask recessive mutations of tumor-suppressor genes. In some studies, amplification of either c-myc, c-erbB2, or int-2 has been found to have a significant association with high risk of relapse or poor survival. The current status of these mutations as potentially useful prognostic indicators for the management of the disease is controversial and points to the need for further research in this area.\r"

  ".W": "The loss of heterozygosity of genes on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p) in human breast carcinomas occurs in a region involved in other malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, lung cancers, and von Hippel-Lindau disease. This finding suggests the presence of a gene(s) that plays a crucial role in multiple cancers. In our study of 84 informative (heterozygous) primary breast tumors, 30% showed losses of heterozygosity on chromosome 3. The shortest region of homozygosity in primary human breast tumor is located between the DNF15S2 and RAF1 loci in the 3p21-p25 region on the short arm of chromosome 3. This region includes at least two members of the c-erbA steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family (c-erbA beta and c-erbA2) that may be of special relevance to breast cancer. Furthermore, tumors with a loss of heterozygosity of genes on chromosome 3 were previously reported to have frequent allelic deletions on chromosome 11p and amplification of the c-myc proto-oncogene. These results highlight the occurrence of multiple genetic alterations in breast tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Since genetic factors may influence outcome after trauma or during infection, the current experiments were performed to examine the resistance of three genetically different mouse strains to burn-induced bacterial translocation. Outbred ICR, inbred Balb/c, and inbred C57/B1 mice, with a normal or disrupted (monoassociated with Escherichia coli C25) GI tract microflora, were subjected to sham or actual 25% body burns. In Balb/c, but not ICR mice, replacing the normal intestinal microflora with E. coli C25 converted the thermal injury from a nonlethal (0% mortality) to a lethal (68% mortality) injury. The increased mortality of the burned Balb/c mice monoassociated with E. coli C25 was associated with a higher incidence (p less than 0.05) and magnitude (p less than 0.05) of E. coli C25 translocation from the GI tract. The C57/B1 mice were intermediate between the Balb/c and ICR strains, in that C57/B1 mice monoassociated with E. coli C25 had a higher mortality and greater E. coli C25 translocation than mice with a normal microflora after thermal injury. Thus the composition of the intestinal microflora as well as the genetic background of the host influence the susceptibility of the host to burn-induced bacterial translocation and survival.\r"

A (possibly or definitely) preventable cause of death was identified in 25% of the fatalities. There was a significantly higher preventable cause of death rate in small general hospitals than in both other hospital categories. Of all fatalities, 21% were classified as preventable deaths. A significantly higher preventable death rate occurred in small general hospitals (48%), than in large general (14%) and university hospitals (19%).

The equipment is described briefly. The same machine currently is being used to destroy renal and biliary stones. The results are encouraging and highly comparable to the initial experience with the earlier machines. Fragmentation rates are approximately 86%, with destruction rates of 63.4% over-all. Ultrasound localization and monitoring proved surprisingly easy to learn and were increasingly less of a problem as experience was gained. No serious complications were observed, and there were no renal losses and no deaths. Only 3 cases of steinstrasse were noted among 461 with 633 stones targeted during 595 treatments.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was done to compare the relative efficacy of an abdominal radiograph and renal ultrasound to excretory urography for the evaluation of asymptomatic patients 1 month after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. We evaluated 101 renal units in 84 asymptomatic patients who had undergone extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy 1 month previously with abdominal radiography, excretory urography and ultrasonography to evaluate the presence of retained stone fragments, dilatation of the collecting system and intrarenal or perirenal fluid collections or masses. The combination of abdominal radiography and ultrasonography identified retained fragments in 62 renal units, while excretory urography identified them in 54. Ultrasonography was less specific in identifying dilatation of part or all of the collecting system; proving falsely positive in 7 renal units and falsely negative in 14 compared to excretory urography. However, the case of obstruction was diagnosed correctly by both modalities. Finally, ultrasound appeared to be more specific and more sensitive in the evaluation of the presence of intrarenal or perirenal abnormalities. We conclude that a combination of abdominal radiography and ultrasonography is as good or better than excretory urography in identifying residual stone fragments and intrarenal or perirenal abnormalities. However, the finding of dilatation of all or part of the collecting system by ultrasonography is nonspecific and probably is better evaluated by excretory urography. We suggest that the routine radiological evaluation of asymptomatic patients 1 month after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy could be limited routinely to abdominal radiography and ultrasonography. However, when abnormalities of the collecting system are visualized on these studies excretory urography should be performed.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of indomethacin suppositories in the relief of acute colic and prevention of recurrent colic, we instituted a prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. Patients were randomized to receive either 50 mg. indomethacin or placebo suppositories every 8 hours and all patients received prescriptions for supplemental narcotics to be used on an as needed basis. Relief of colic was assessed by counting the total number of supplemental narcotics used by each patient per 24 hours during the study period, which was defined as until passage of the calculus or 5 days. There were 41 patients entered into the study protocol and complete followup was available for 26. Mean calculus size was 3.4 mm. in the indomethacin group versus 3.1 mm. in the placebo group. All 13 patients in the control group had recurrent episodes of colic and 8 of these 13 had more than 1 recurrent episode. Five patients in the placebo group required admission to the hospital for control of pain. In contrast, only 4 of the 13 patients in the treatment group had colic and only 1 had more than 1 episode of colic. No patient in the active drug group required admission to the hospital for control of pain. Over-all the ratio of supplemental narcotic used by the placebo group versus the indomethacin group was 7.6:1 (p less than 0.005). The mean interval time to passage of the calculus was slightly lower in the indomethacin group (89 versus 82 hours) but this difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.10). Our data strongly support the use of indomethacin suppositories in the prevention of recurrent colic secondary to ureteral calculi.\r"

The stoma is easy to construct, has a low risk of evagination because the inner tube is stabilized with sutures and is easy to catheterize. It does not require staples, which reduces the chance of stone or fistula formation. The terminal ileum in continuity with the cecum or an isolated ileal segment can be used.\r"

Because most of the patients had undergone papaverine injection with or without duplex ultrasonography, we compared these results with the electron microscopic findings. In patients with a good arterial response and full erection after papaverine injection the ultrastructural findings were similar to those reported in normal men. In patients with moderate arterial disease a distinct increase in mitochondria with aggregation and cytoplasmic vacuolization in smooth muscle cells was noted. These findings could be interpreted as an active cellular attempt to respond to the altered environmental and nutritive situation. In patients with severe arterial insufficiency the cellular structure was markedly altered, the number of intracavernous smooth muscle cells was reduced and the density of the connective tissue separating individual cells was increased. These changes in the smooth muscle cells consisted of contour irregularity with fragmentation and loss of the basal lamina. The cytoplasm was largely devoid of contractile elements. The nuclei tended to be pleomorphic with unevenly distributed chromatin. The endothelium was also altered significantly in this group. A careful clinical evaluation of penile arterial function should be performed in all patients undergoing penile arterial or venous corrective surgery. If doubt remains, a penile biopsy may be indicated.\r"

Of these patients 8 were potent men who were evaluated for reasons other than erectile failure. These potent men were used as controls to obtain normal values. The remaining 132 patients had erectile impotence of various etiologies. Real-time imaging with high resolution, high frequency probes allowed for visualization of the cavernous arteries along the entire length in addition to accurate measurement of the diameter. Simultaneous selectively focused Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure the blood velocity and other vascular parameters in the cavernous and dorsal arteries. Comparison of measurements before and after papaverine injection allowed for objective interpretation of the injection results. The results were analyzed and compared to other data available on the same patients, such as history and physical examination, nocturnal penile tumescence, penile blood pressures, selective arteriography and dynamic cavernosography. In addition to the 8 potent men, there were 35 patients (27% of the impotent patients) whose vascular findings were normal. A total of 78 patients (59% of the impotent patients) had arterial insufficiency; a subgroup of 13 patients had the pelvic arterial steal syndrome. Dynamic cavernosography confirmed venous leak in all 19 patients (14% of the impotent patients) whose penile duplex ultrasonography suggested the possibility of a venous leak. Ten patients (7%) had prolonged erection after papaverine injection and they were managed without consequences. One patient had a small hematoma that resolved uneventfully. Penile duplex ultrasonography was a helpful and objective method to evaluate vasculogenic impotence.\r"

Seven patients were treated with 150 mg. captopril daily after determination of baseline 24-hour urine cystine excretion. All patients had a history of multiple cystine stones, and were on chronic fluid and alkalization therapy. Five patients had previously been on D-penicillamine. Cystine excretion studies were repeated 1 to 5 months after institution of captopril. Baseline 24-hour urinary cystine excretion ranged from 580 to 970 mg. per gm. creatinine (mean 744). After institution of captopril these levels decreased to a range of 113 to 581 mg. per gm. creatinine (mean 371). These values on treatment represented a statistically significant decrease to between 18 and 89% of baseline levels (p equals 0.0045). We conclude that captopril can significantly, and at times profoundly, decrease urinary cystine excretion in patients with homozygous cystinuria. Further studies are required to elucidate fully the mechanism of urinary cystine reduction and to help define a possible role for this drug in routine maintenance or dissolution therapy.\r"

Each patient had markedly dilated or shortened ureters that prevented conventional Leadbetter ureteral reimplantation into a colon conduit. Ascending colon was brought out as a cutaneous stoma, the ureters were anastomosed to ileum, and an antireflux mechanism was created from plicated terminal ileum and the native ileocecal valve. Significant reflux was prevented in all 3 patients. This technique provides a means to prevent urinary reflux into short or dilated ureters, and increases the versatility of the ileocecal segment for use in diversion and urinary tract reconstruction.\r"

A patient with pure seminoma was given inappropriate chemotherapy on the basis of an elevated human chorionic gonadotropin level, later shown to be due to a nonspecific serum interfering substance. A discordant human chorionic gonadotropin result should be suspected when the human chorionic gonadotropin is only modestly elevated, there is no serial increase in the human chorionic gonadotropin level and no other evidence of tumor can be found.\r"

Agarose-embedded urothelial cells from 24 biopsy-proven cancer patients and 10 controls were stained for surface immunofluorescence with four monoclonal antibodies reactive with human bladder cancer and three monoclonals reactive with blood group A. Reactivity was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. One antibody, BLCA-8 appeared to have particular diagnostic utility. Thus, 24.3 +/- 5.8 percent of outer layer and 27.0 +/- 4.6 percent of inner layer urothelial cells reacted with BLCA-8 in patient samples, compared to 2.9 +/- 1.0 and 0.8 +/- 0.5 percent of similar cells from control urines. BLCA-8 antigen expression was found to be relatively stable even after prolonged exposure to urine. In a comparison with conventional cytology, samples from 4/8 patients were considered positive by standard methods, whereas, 8/8 were BLCA-8 positive. This new technique may thus be a useful adjunct to conventional methods.\r"

Kidneys from animals sacrificed at the age of six weeks or one year were also examined histologically. The obstructed renal pelvis was enlarged by about 35 times and there was a delayed excretion of 99mTc-DTPA during forced diuresis, indicating significant, chronic obstruction. The renal DMSA-uptake ratio (left kidney/(left and right kidney] was reduced to about 40% from the first week of obstruction. The parenchymal weight ratio (expressed as above) was reduced to about 45% after both six weeks and one year. The glomerular filtration rate, examined during forced diuresis and calculated on the basis of uptake capacity, was lowered to 42% after six weeks but was not significantly reduced after one year of obstruction. The incidence figures for medullary hemorrhage or accumulation of iron pigment, and chronic inflammatory changes in the cortex were somewhat higher after one year of obstruction than after 6 weeks, but the lesions were patchy in both groups. We conclude that partial unilateral ureteric obstruction, created in the neonatal period, leads to a slight but permanent functional disturbance and parenchymal weight reduction without prominent structural parenchymal damage.\r"

Forty-six patients (47 legs) with symptomatic varicose veins have been studied while they were in the erect position. Nineteen legs had skin changes whereas the rest (28 legs) had only varicose veins with no skin changes. In 45 limbs, reflux was confined to one vein only: long saphenous vein in 28, short saphenous vein in nine, and femoropopliteal vein in eight. In one limb, reflux was found in the long saphenous, short saphenous, and femoropopliteal veins, and in another it was found in the long and short saphenous veins. In the latter two limbs the amount of reflux found in each vein was added to obtain the total reflux in the limb. In the limbs with skin changes, reflux (median +/- 90% tolerance levels) was 30 (10 to 53) ml/sec; whereas in limbs with no skin changes it was 10 (3 to 44) ml/sec. Reflux greater than 10 ml/sec was associated with a high incidence of skin changes (66%) irrespective of whether this was in the superficial or deep veins; reflux less than 10 ml/sec was not associated with skin changes.\r"

The database of the Brain Resuscitation Clinical Trial I, a multi-institutional study designed to evaluate the effect of thiopental sodium therapy on neurological outcome following brain ischemia, was used for a retrospective review of the effects of glucocorticoid treatment on neurological outcome after global brain ischemia. This study included 262 initially comatose cardiac arrest survivors who made no purposeful response to pain after restoration of spontaneous circulation. The standard treatment protocol left glucocorticoid therapy to the discretion of the hospital investigators. This resulted in four patient groups that received either no, low, medium, or high doses of glucocorticoids in the first 8 hours after arrest. Neurological outcome was scored using a modification of the Glasgow Cerebral Performance Category Scale. None of the steroid regimens statistically improved mean group survival rate or neurological recovery rate over that observed in the group that did not receive steroids. The routine clinical practice of administrating glucocorticoids after global brain ischemia may be associated with serious complications and is not justified.\r"

The measurement of agreement employed, the kappa statistic, ranged from .45 to .53 among the four laboratories and from .50 to .54 within the commercial laboratory. These values represent low levels of agreement. The data suggest that Lyme disease serological testing procedures should be standardized so that Lyme disease test results are more comparable between laboratories.\r"

Subjects in the L-tryptophan/placebo condition received the active substance for 4 days followed by the placebo with a 4-day washout period in between. A second group of subjects received the same regimen of reverse order and a third received placebos on both occasions. There were two additional control groups that received no substances. All subjects in the study reported decreased levels of depression due to nonspecific treatment effects. The subjects who took L-tryptophan in either sequence reported even lower levels of depression. Sleep disturbance was not affected by L-tryptophan since it was barely present when the study began. A phenomenon referred to as the interval effect is discussed and an alternative explanation for this effect is offered.\r"

Particular attention is paid to the methods used to estimate productivity loss which comprises over half of total abuse costs. This study concludes that these estimates are inaccurate and that they continually overstate actual costs. The main reasons for this overstatement are the attribution of causality to alcohol abuse where none has been shown to exist and improper methodology with regard to productivity impairment measures. In addition to being inaccurate at any point in time, the estimates are not a valid measure of the costs over time due to changing definitions of what constitutes alcohol abuse and lack of correction for inflation. Also, the method used implies cost comparisons with a society with no alcohol abuse. As a result of these considerations the estimates lack policy relevance.\r"

  ".W": "Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is characterized by muscle weakness, hyporeflexia, and autonomic dysfunction, which result from impaired release of acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve terminals. It is frequently associated with cancer, it is autoimmune-mediated, and treatment has been unsatisfactory. 3,4-Diaminopyridine enhances the release of acetylcholine. In this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 12 patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (7 of whom had cancer), 3,4-diaminopyridine in doses up to 100 mg per day was effective in treating both the motor and the autonomic deficits of the syndrome. Muscle strength increased from an average of 70 percent of normal to 81 percent of normal in the upper extremities, and from 45 to 65 percent of normal in the lower extremities. The amplitudes of compound-muscle-action potentials nearly doubled, increasing from an average of 2.9 mV to 5.0 mV in the arm and from 1.6 mV to 3.1 mV in the leg. Autonomic symptoms were relieved. One patient had a seizure after 10 months of treatment, but other side effects from the drug were minimal and dose-related. We conclude that 3,4-diaminopyridine, either alone or in conjunction with other therapies, may be useful in the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.\r"

When the patients received the cod-liver-oil supplement, the mean (+/- SEM) transcapillary escape rate of albumin (as compared with the base-line rate) decreased from 8.7 +/- 0.5 to 6.9 +/- 0.6 percent per hour (P less than 0.01), and the blood pressure decreased from 146 +/- 4/90 +/- 2 mm Hg to 139 +/- 4/85 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). There was no correlation, however, between cod-liver oil's effect on the transcapillary escape rate of albumin and its effect on blood pressure. There was no change from base line after the patients received the olive-oil supplement. During dietary supplementation with cod-liver oil, the plasma concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased and the concentrations of very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides decreased (P less than 0.05 for all comparisons), but the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change. In contrast, during supplementation with olive oil, the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and the levels of very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride increased (P less than 0.05 for all comparisons), but there was no change in the level of high-density lipoprotein. No changes were observed in the glomerular filtration rate, degree of albuminuria, insulin requirement, glycosylated hemoglobin level, or blood glucose level during supplementation with either oil. We conclude that dietary supplementation with cod-liver oil lowers the elevated transcapillary escape rate of albumin characteristic of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and albuminuria, independently of its effect on blood pressure--perhaps by decreasing vascular permeability. We did not find any effect of cod-liver oil on urinary albumin excretion.\r"

  ".U": "90066674\r", 
  ".W": "Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are integral membrane proteins present on virtually all vertebrate cells and consist of a heterodimer between the highly polymorphic alpha-chain and the beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) protein of relative molecular mass 12,000 (ref. 1). These cell-surface molecules play a pivotal part in the recognition of antigens, the cytotoxic response of T cells, and the induction of self tolerance. It is possible, however, that the function of MHC class I molecules is not restricted to the immune system, but extends to a wide variety of biological reactions including cell-cell interactions. For example, MHC class I molecules seem to be associated with various cell-surface proteins, including the receptors for insulin, epidermal growth factor, luteinizing hormone and the beta-adrenergic receptor. In mice, class I molecules are secreted in the urine and act as highly specific olfactory cues which influence mating preference. The beta 2-m protein has also been identified as the smaller component of the Fc receptor in neonatal intestinal cells, and it has been suggested that the protein induces collagenase in fibroblasts. Cells lacking beta 2-m are deficient in the expression of MHC class I molecules, indicating that the association with beta 2-m is crucial for the transport of MHC class I molecules to the cell surface. The most direct means of unravelling the many biological functions of beta 2-m is to create a mutant mouse with a defective beta 2-m gene. We have now used the technique of homologous recombination to disrupt the beta 2-m gene. We report here that introduction of a targeting vector into embryonic stem cells resulted in beta 2-m gene disruption with high frequency. Chimaeric mice derived from blastocysts injected with mutant embryonic stem cell clones transmit the mutant allele to their offspring.\r"

The partial purification and characterization of HGF have been reported. We have demonstrated that pure HGF from rat platelets is a new growth factor effective at concentrations as low as 1 ng ml-1. The effects of HGF and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are additive. The activity of HGF is not species-specific, although it does not stimulate growth in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. HGF has a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 82,000 and is a heterodimer composed of a large alpha-subunit of Mr 69,000 and a small beta-subunit of Mr 34,000. Here we report the amino-acid sequence of human HGF determined by complementary DNA cloning and the expression of biologically active human HGF from COS-1 cells transfected with cloned cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of the human HGF cDNA reveals that both alpha- and beta-chains are contained in a single open reading frame coding for a pre-pro precursor protein of 728 amino acids.\r"

  ".W": "The way in which proteins attain and maintain their final form is of fundamental importance. Recent work has focused on the role of a set of ubiquitous proteins, termed chaperonins, in the assembly of phage and multisubunit proteins. The range of chaperonin action is unknown; they could interact with most cellular polypeptides or have a limited subset of protein partners. Included in the chaperonin family is the essential heat-shock regulated Escherichia coli groEL gene product. Over-expression of the groE operon in E. coli causes enhanced assembly of heterologously expressed ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase subunits and suppresses the heat-sensitive mutant phenotype of several dnaA alleles. It has been inferred that suppression of heat-sensitive mutations is confined to dnaA alleles and that this confinement could reflect an interaction between the groE operon products and a dnaA protein aggregate at the replication origin. We now report that multiple copies of the groE operon suppress mutations in genes encoding several diverse proteins. Our data indicate a general role for the groE operon products, the GroEL and GroES proteins, in the folding-assembly pathways of many proteins.\r"

Here I give the first example in which the island dwarf is well dated, the full-sized ancestor is found in demonstrably older deposits on the island, and a good estimate can be made for the duration of the isolation leading to dwarfing.

  ".W": "Glia-derived nexin (GDN), also known as protease nexin I, is a serine protease inhibitor of deduced relative molecular mass 41,700, identified in conditioned media of glioma cells by its neurite-promoting activity. GDN can promote neurite outgrowth in vitro from neuroblastoma cells, sympathetic neurons and hippocampal neurons (L. Farmer et al., manuscript in preparation). In vivo, GDN is constitutively expressed in all parts of the olfactory system, where axonal regeneration and neurogenesis occur continuously throughout life. This observation indicates that GDN could be important for axonal regeneration in vivo. To investigate this possibility, we have taken advantage of the fact that damage to nerves in the peripheral nervous system leads to their regeneration, whereas in the central nervous system no such regeneration can occur. Here we report that after lesion of the rat sciatic nerve there is a large transient increase in the amount of GDN messenger RNA and of released GDN. The cells showing GDN immunoreactivity are mainly localized distal to the lesion site. These results further support the suggestion that GDN is important for axonal regeneration in vivo, and indicate that protease inhibitors could have a role in Wallerian degeneration and peripheral nerve regeneration.\r"

It is believed that this increment results mainly from Ca2+ influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels because insulin secretion is abolished by dihydropyridine antagonists and is potentiated by dihydropyridine agonists. Glucose may influence Ca2+ influx through these channels in two ways: either by regulating the beta-cell membrane potential or by biochemical modulation of the channel itself. The former mechanism is well established. Glucose metabolism, by closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels, depolarizes the beta-cell membrane and initiates Ca2+-dependent electrical activity, with higher glucose concentrations further increasing Ca2+ influx by raising the frequency of action potentials. We show here that glucose metabolism also increases calcium influx directly, by modulating the activity of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels.\r"

  ".W": "Two main types of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have been identified in neuronal cells. The fibrous MAPs, including MAP2 and tau, serve to organize and regulate the assembly of microtubules. A second distinct class of force-producing MAPs, including kinesin, dynein and dynamin, are involved in microtubule-based movement. These proteins are mechanochemical ATPases which seem to be responsible for the bidirectional transport of organelles and perhaps also the movement of chromosomes. Here we report that MAP2 inhibits microtubule gliding on dynein-coated coverslips, as well as the microtubule-activated ATPase of dynein, indicating that MAP2 and other fibrous MAPs could be important modulators of microtubule-based motility in vivo. By proteolytic modification of tubulin, we found that dynein interacts with microtubules at the C termini of alpha- and beta-tubulin, the regions previously reported to be the sites for the interaction of MAP2. The use of site-directed antibodies implicates a small region of alpha- and beta-tubulin, containing the sequence Glu-Gly-Glu-Glu, as the site of the interaction of dynein and MAP2 with the microtubule.\r"

Several protein growth factors as well as their cellular receptors have been identified as products of proto-oncogenes. Furthermore, these growth factors have been identified as glial mitogens in normal glial cell cultures as well as in tumors. The analysis of growth factor biology gains additional weight by the demonstration of autocrine growth factor secretion by tumor cells. The role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor system in glial cell proliferation and differentiation is presented, with the speculation that the EGF receptor system may integrate the biological actions of many different factors, of which EGF itself may be least important. The literature on platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factors is reviewed, and the biology of fibroblast growth factor is presented in perspective with such phenomena as neovascularization and cell-matrix interactions.\r"

Stable Doppler signals were obtained for prolonged periods of time, and they correlated with intraoperative events. Monitoring during spontaneous blood pressure and CO2 variations allowed assessment of autoregulatory capacity. In particular, 5 of the 7 patients receiving craniotomy for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage had impaired autoregulation. A 30 to 50% decrease in Doppler velocities was seen in 7 patients after etomidate administration. Early experience suggests that transcranial Doppler monitoring during craniotomy is feasible and can indicate the effects of operative events on blood flow as well as provide an assessment of cerebral autoregulation.\r"

In situations in which the ventricles are small or displaced, insertion of a ventricular catheter may be difficult. Multiple passes to cannulate the ventricle may damage the brain and manipulation of the catheter and reservoir may cause migration of the catheter, possibly compromising its function. A stereotactic method for insertion of ventricular access reservoirs using a device that attaches to the Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic system has been developed. With this device the catheter and reservoir are guided into place as a single unit, utilizing a guide attached to the Brown-Roberts-Wells frame. This technique has been useful in inserting ventricular access reservoirs into patients with small ventricles or in whom there is some abnormality of the brain or skull that renders classical landmarks for ventricular cannulation useless.\r"

The study was completed by 156 mildly to moderately ill Parkinson's patients (primarily Hoehn and Yahr stage II to III) at 10 sites. Patients had their treatment optimized on standard Sinemet prior to beginning Sinemet CR treatment. Following titration, there was a median reduction in dosing frequency of 25% (from 4.1 to 3.2 doses/day) relative to the standard Sinemet baseline. Total daily levodopa dosage increased from 623 to 808 mg/day (+33%), a factor consistent with the lower bioavailability of the controlled-release formulation. Mean efficacy scores on the New York University Parkinson's Disease Scale decreased from 7.4 at the end of baseline to 5.8 at 12 weeks, a decline of 20%. The scores remained at this level throughout 52 weeks of treatment. At the end of 1 year of treatment, 60% of patients rated themselves as improved, while physicians rated 64% of the patients as improved. Adverse experiences were similar to those reported by patients taking standard levodopa preparations. Two thirds of the reported adverse experiences occurred within the 1st 3 months of Sinemet CR therapy, indicating that increased length of exposure to Sinemet CR was not associated with an increasing incidence of adverse experiences.\r"

Striatal denervation following degeneration of the substantia nigra dopaminergic projections is probably the major pathophysiologic mechanism underlying motor fluctuations. In addition, pathologic modification of striatal receptors, partially related to the nonphysiologic delivery of levodopa in a discontinuous pulsatile mode, may be responsible for the various types of dyskinesias and sudden \"off\" episodes. Drugs capable of providing a stable dopaminergic stimulation should be particularly useful for preventing the development of motor complications in patients not yet treated. At the other end of the clinical spectrum, patients with complex fluctuations are the least likely to improve with slow-release levodopa preparations.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of Sinemet CR, a controlled-release formulation containing carbidopa and levodopa, were investigated in healthy young and elderly volunteers and in patients with Parkinson's disease. Sinemet CR produced more sustained plasma levels of levodopa, carbidopa, and 3-O methyldopa than did conventional Sinemet. In elderly subjects, the corresponding steady-state plasma levels fluctuated in narrower ranges with Sinemet CR than those following the administration of Sinemet. Results indicate a levodopa bioavailability of 71% for Sinemet CR, in contrast to a bioavailability of 99% for Sinemet for these subjects. The carbidopa bioavailability of Sinemet CR was 58% relative to that of Sinemet. Systemic decarboxylase inhibition was comparable between the 2 regimens as indicated by the renal clearance of levodopa. The absorption of levodopa was slower and more protracted with Sinemet CR than with Sinemet. Food increased the levodopa bioavailability of Sinemet CR. This increase was attributed to an increased gastric retention time. No dose-dumping occurred with Sinemet CR in either the nonfasting or the fasting state. Levodopa bioavailability was lower in young volunteers than in elderly volunteers. This was attributed to an age-related decrease in gastric emptying and in 1st-pass metabolic decarboxylation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In parkinsonian patients, as in healthy subjects, the Sinemet CR formulation produced more sustained levodopa plasma levels. These patients required a higher total daily dosage of Sinemet CR than of Sinemet for control of parkinsonian symptoms, but less frequent dosing was required during chronic therapy. Peak plasma levodopa levels increased proportionately with increasing Sinemet CR dosage. These observations were consistent with the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the formulation.\r"

The most effective is Sinemet CR (Sinemet CR4), with an erodible polymer matrix that retards release of levodopa. In 19 parkinsonians with prominent dose-by-dose fluctuations, double-blind crossover trials comparing 8-week regimens of standard carbidopa/levodopa (25/100) to Sinemet CR (50/200) showed comparable clinical outcomes, with mean daily dosing for optimal control reduced from 10.2 to 5.4 (although mean daily levodopa dosage increased from 1,340 to 1,781 mg/day). Most patients improved on the Sinemet CR regimen in hours \"on\" and in ratings of clinical state and disability. With pharmacokinetic studies correlated to clinical ratings, plasma levodopa was less variable during Sinemet CR treatment, and clinical responses showed greater uniformity. Compared to standard Sinemet 25/100, time to peak levodopa concentration (2.3 versus 1.1 hrs), onset of maximal clinical improvement (2.2 versus 1.1 hrs), and other indices were significantly delayed with Sinemet CR. Levodopa bioavailability and clearance were similar between formulations. Although onset of clinical response is slower, the Sinemet CR formulation lessens peak-dose and \"wearing-off\" responses occurring with conventional carbidopa/levodopa and offers substantial improvement for some parkinsonians.\r"

Treatment with Sinemet CR significantly reduced daily \"off\" time. According to both physician and patient global ratings, patients showed significant improvements with Sinemet CR compared to treatment with standard Sinemet. Patients preferred Sinemet CR treatment by a ratio of approximately 2 to 1. Daily dosing frequency was 33% less with Sinemet CR, while daily intake of levodopa required was increased by 25%. The safety profiles of the 2 formulations were similar.

Over time, however, an increasing number of parkinsonian patients evidence motor response complications, notably abnormal involuntary movements and motor fluctuations. Clinical pharmacologic studies suggest that these phenomena may arise as a consequence of factors reflecting both natural disease progression and levodopa toxicity. Simple wearing-off responses appear primarily related to advancing degenerative changes afflicting the dopamine system. The appearance of peak-dose dyskinesias and complex, random motor fluctuations of the on-off type, on the other hand, may signal secondary postjunctional changes arising as a consequence of chronic intermittent excitation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors that are normally tonically stimulated. Therapeutically, prompt correction of wearing-off fluctuations can ordinarily be achieved by measures that deliver dopaminomimetics continuously to the central nervous system. In contrast, fluctuations of the on-off type initially persist despite stable circulating levodopa levels. With continuous levodopa treatment, however, the threshold for dyskinesias begins to rise and the dose-response relation shifts to the right; clinically, the severity of both dyskinesias and on-off fluctuations tends to diminish. It is thus tempting to speculate that the early and continuing treatment of Parkinson's disease with compounds providing a relatively constant level of central dopamine stimulation will preclude wearing-off phenomena and mitigate on-off fluctuations and severe dyskinesias.\r"

Although dosages of CR required for an optimal therapeutic response were not significantly higher compared with conventional levodopa, bioavailability significantly increased.

This report discusses the results of a 14-week double-blind crossover study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of standard Sinemet with controlled-release Sinemet CR. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between Sinemet CR and standard Sinemet on any of the major efficacy measures, suggesting a clinical equivalence in terms of treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The study also supports the tolerability of Sinemet CR.

CSF obtained from 1 of these patients postmortem did not contain detectable levels of anticerebellar antibody, but histopathologic examination of her cerebellum revealed patchy loss of Purkinje cells. In the 3rd patient, antibody titers fell with removal of the primary tumor and chemotherapy but did not rise with tumor recurrence. Indirect immunofluorescence did not reveal anticerebellar antibodies in the serum or CSF of other patients with neoplasms, patients with other cerebellar disease, or normal controls. The present study demonstrates that patients with ovarian malignancies may occasionally develop antibodies that react with cerebellar neuronal antigens and can maintain this antibody response for protracted periods of time without clinically evident cerebellar injury. Tumor recurrence may not be accompanied by rise in titers of anticerebellar antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Blindness due to opacification of the lens, or cataract, afflicts 50 million persons worldwide. In the United States over 541,000 cataract extractions are done annually at a cost of over $3.8 billion. Conservative estimates indicate that the prevalences of cataracts in Americans aged 65-75 and 75-85 years are 18% and 46%, respectively. Cataracts are even more prevalent in some other populations. It is estimated that the need for cataract extractions would be diminished by half if onset of cataract could be delayed by only ten years. Hypotheses regarding the etiology of cataract include oxidative perturbations of protein metabolism, diverse pathologic conditions, and perhaps glycation of lens proteins. Epidemiologic data indicate that elevated plasma levels of specific nutrients (i.e., carotenoids, ascorbate, tocopherol, and taurine) are associated with diminished incidence of certain types of cataract. Biochemical evidence suggests that each of these compounds can delay photooxidative damage to lens proteins. Roles in lens metabolism for selenium and tryptophan have been suggested. Elucidation of mechanisms by which caloric restriction delays cataract development is a promising area of current research.\r"

Fifty pregnant women with intact membranes who recently had genital tract cultures for group B streptococci were evaluated. The study group consisted of 25 women who had positive cultures, and the control group comprised 25 women who had negative cultures. All patients underwent examination with a sterile nonlubricated speculum within 7 days of the previously obtained cultures. Secretions from the endocervix and from the posterior vaginal wall near the introitus were collected with a sterile cotton-tipped applicator and inoculated directly onto a selective blood agar culture plate. The sterile speculum was removed and a digital examination performed using bacteriostatic lubricant. A second sterile speculum was then inserted into the vagina and another group B streptococcal culture was obtained. There was 100% correlation between the cultures obtained before and after the vaginal examination. We conclude that use of bacteriostatic lubricant does not alter the recovery of group B streptococci from the genital tract of pregnant women with intact membranes.\r"

There were no significant differences with respect to the maternal characteristics, cervical dilatation and effacement, induction-to-labor interval, induction-to-delivery interval, cesarean section rate, analgesia for labor, or low Apgar scores. No hyperstimulation was noted in either group. In each group, 20% of the patients had dysfunctional labor patterns, with coupling and tripling of the uterine contractions. The mean +/- SEM oxytocin administered in the pulsed-infusion group was significantly lower than that in the continuous-infusion group (2.1 +/- 0.4 versus 4.1 +/- 0.4 mU/minute; P less than .001). The mean +/- SEM total amount of oxytocin administered was 1300 +/- 332 mU for the pulsed group and 1803 +/- 302 mU for the continuous group, indicating that lower amounts of oxytocin were required for pulsed administration. Our study demonstrates that pulsatile administration of oxytocin is similar in efficacy to our standard continuous oxytocin infusion and requires a lower total amount and rate of oxytocin administered, which may afford a greater margin of safety.\r"

Over a 3.5-year period, the risk for preterm labor was determined in 943 indigent black inner-city women using the Papiernik-Creasy scoring system. High-risk women were allocated randomly to a Preterm Labor Detection Clinic or to serve as high-risk controls. Women with lower risk scores served as low-risk controls. Women from both control groups were not informed of their risk status, and both groups received prenatal care in standard obstetric clinics. Women accepting the Preterm Labor Detection Clinic Program received comprehensive patient education and were seen weekly starting at 22 weeks' gestation. Despite this extensive outpatient program, there were no significant differences between the high-risk groups with respect to mean gestational age at delivery, mean birth weight, or percentage delivering before term as a result of preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes (PROM). Evaluations of inpatient charges revealed no significant differences due to participation in this program, although outpatient clinic utilization and charges were increased significantly for Preterm Labor Detection Clinic patients. Failure of this program to reduce preterm birth may relate to the relatively low overall rate of women presenting in preterm labor with advanced cervical dilation. In contrast, high rates of PROM and fetal death occurred in all three study groups.\r"

Germ cell neoplasms were the most common group of benign ovarian neoplasms; epithelial neoplasms were the most common malignant neoplasm. Stromal neoplasms and neoplasms of low malignant potential were uncommon at all ages. The risk that an ovarian neoplasm was malignant increased 12-fold from ages 20-29 to 60-69. The overall risk that an ovarian neoplasm was malignant was 13% in premenopausal women and 45% in postmenopausal women.\r"

These changes can obscure both syphilitic histologic findings and special stains for spirochetes in tissue specimens used to confirm the diagnosis of congenital syphilis. Five gravidas with untreated syphilis and fetal deaths underwent sonographic examination and amniocentesis. In all five cases, dark-field microscopic examination of the amniotic fluid showed spirochetes with morphology and motility characteristic of Treponema pallidum. Organisms were infrequent, but easily identified at 400x magnification and confirmed using an oil-immersion objective yielding a 900x magnification. After delivery, fetal-placental examination and autopsy showed clinical findings typical of congenital syphilis in all five cases. Histologic changes compatible with syphilis were found in all four autopsied fetuses. Silver impregnation stains were positive in two of five tissue specimens, and anti-treponemal monoclonal antibody immunofluorescence assays were positive in one of three amniotic fluid specimens examined retrospectively, further strengthening the specificity of the dark-field microscopic identification of spirochetes. This technique, which can make the diagnosis of congenital syphilis, is recommended for women with syphilis and a fetal death, especially if sonographic hydrops and/or edema is present or if an autopsy will not be performed.\r"

The patients were followed for an average of 56 and 51 months, respectively. Criteria for failure were a confirmed IOP of greater than 32 mmHg, stereophotographically documented optic nerve progression, or development of glaucomatous visual field loss by Goldmann or Octopus perimetry. Nine patients failed in the TT group and 17 in the NT group (P = 0.07). Of the nine TT group failures, six had discontinued timolol before failure (4 for greater than 6 months). In a Cox proportional hazards analysis controlling for confounding variables, timolol was found to be significantly protective with an adjusted risk ratio of 0.38 (95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.89, P = 0.03). When only field and disc failure criteria were considered, timolol treatment was found to be significantly protective in an analysis considering patients who stopped timolol as being lost to follow-up (P = 0.05). A higher tonographic facility of outflow was protective in all analyses. A trend toward a substantial loss of effectiveness of timolol on IOP was not observed. Seasonal fluctuations in IOP were observed (P = 0.0007), with higher IOP occurring in the winter. The results demonstrate a favorable influence of timolol therapy on the clinical course of patients with mildly elevated IOP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For posttreatment color fundus photographs, these methods are used to assess the extent and intensity of treatment. Although these methods were developed to judge eligibility and treatment of patients enrolled in the MPS, they provide an excellent way for all treating ophthalmologists to evaluate their patients' angiograms and to assess immediately the intensity and extent of laser photocoagulation. The technique requires a microfilm reader or slide projection device to determine the completeness of treatment. The authors superimpose independent drawings made from pre- and posttreatment photographs. The techniques described can be applied readily in clinical practice. Since persistent neovascularization is highly correlated with incomplete and/or inadequate photocoagulation treatment, clinicians may adopt these Reading Center techniques to minimize the frequency of persistent neovascularization and, possibly, to reduce the frequency of visual loss in treated eyes.\r"

Rates of change in tumor height were computed for each patient using follow-up ultrasonographic measures during the first 2 years after treatment. Risk of metastasis was evaluated separately in the first 2 years after treatment when tumor decline was assessed (concurrent metastasis), and 2 years or later after treatment (subsequent metastasis). Using Cox proportional hazards models to adjust for other known risk factors, tumors regressing rapidly were significantly more likely to metastasize concurrently with their regression (P less than 0.05). The opposite was found for subsequent metastasis: tumors with a slow annual decline were more likely to metastasize after 2 years after treatment (P less than 0.05). Substantial changes also were noted in the ability of previously described prognostic factors (largest tumor diameter, tumor height, ciliary body involvement, and patient's age) to predict early and late metastasis. Characteristics placing individuals at high risk of metastasis may change markedly with time after treatment.\r"

  ".W": "In summary, infants and children who have acute otitis media should receive antimicrobial therapy. Amoxicillin is the standard of therapy for infants and children with acute otitis media, because it is safe and effective for most of the causative bacterial pathogens. Amoxicillin has also been shown to be effective for treatment of selected children with otitis media with effusion (\"secretory\" otitis media) and is the recommended prophylactic antimicrobial agent for prevention of frequently recurrent acute otitis media. During the past decade, however, an increasing rate of bacteria that are resistant to amoxicillin has occurred, primarily beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis. Because of the emergence of these bacteria, other antimicrobial agents, both old and new, have been advocated for treatment and prevention of otitis media; amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime axetil, and cefixime are the newer agents. These agents are indicated for selected infants and children; however, for most patients, amoxicillin remains a safe and relatively inexpensive effective drug. The common surgical procedures, such as myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion, and adenoidectomy with myringotomy with or without tympanostomy tube insertion, have now been shown to be effective for patients who have recurrent acute otitis media and chronic otitis media with effusion. The decision for or against these procedures should not only include consultation with an otolaryngologist but should also involve the parents and the child, if old enough. The risks, costs, and benefits of nonsurgical and surgical management should be discussed with all parties concerned.\r"

Although endoscopy provides information about the status of the upper airway, the length of time elapsed from extubation may affect the predictive value of observations made at endoscopy. The otolaryngologist should avoid recommending surgical intervention for relief of upper-airway compromise when the major cause of respiratory insufficiency is in the lower airway. Conversely, appropriate surgical intervention at the appropriate time may obviate the need for a tracheotomy. Lastly, if the prognosis is such that continued intubation is necessary and may lead to laryngeal or subglottic damage, a tracheotomy should be performed.\r"

The results indicate that adolescents from families with incomes below the poverty level were three times as likely to be reported in only fair or poor health status and were 47% more likely to suffer from disabling chronic illnesses than adolescents from families with incomes above the poverty level. Use of inpatient hospital services was similar for adolescents from poor and nonpoor families when health status was controlled. However, adolescents from poor families were 35% more likely than those from nonpoor families to have waited 2 or more years between physician contacts. In addition, poor adolescents made 13% fewer physician contacts on an annual basis when compared with nonpoor adolescents. Substantial differences in utilization rates were found when poor adolescents were disaggregated according to whether they were covered by Medicaid. Those with Medicaid coverage used physician services at rates similar to nonpoor adolescents, whereas those without Medicaid coverage lagged substantially behind. Based on the conclusion that Medicaid is effective in reducing barriers to needed services, strategies for expanding Medicaid eligibility to additional low-income adolescents are discussed.\r"

At the health station of each school, the students were screened quickly by a physician with portable real-time ultrasound equipment. When a renal abnormality was detected or suspected, the examinee was referred to Taipei Municipal Women and Children's Hospital for further investigation. Radiologic and urologic procedures were then selectively performed to establish the correct diagnosis. Renal abnormalities were detected in 645 students (approximately 0.5% of total population screened). There were 256 cases of hydronephrosis, 103 cases of unilateral renal agenesis, 128 cases of unilateral small kidney, 90 cases of renal cystic disorders, 30 cases of ectopic kidney, and 38 cases of other abnormalities. Surgically correctable lesions were demonstrated in 50 of these students. Rapid renal ultrasonography was found to effectively detect some renal abnormalities initially, and prevalence could then be established after further investigations.\r"

The central values of respect for individual patients, patient-centered beneficence, full beneficence, and justice must be woven together into an ethical framework that assists nurses in allocating their skills. Professional organizations, such as the AACN, are actively trying to order this ethical disorder by proposing guidelines that, on the one hand, acknowledge societal interests in cost-effective utilization of health care resources, and on the other hand, safeguard the interests and well-being of individual patients. In addition to the guidance from professional organizations, health care institutions should address the inequities in health care by developing policies that guide the health care team through an ethical decision-making process. Nurses, as members of the multidisciplinary health care team and as members of an essential and scarce resource, should participate in formulating these directives. Not only is bedside and institutional involvement important, but participation at the local, state, and national levels will empower nurses to influence decisions of resource allocation at the micro and macro levels.\r"

Nurses caring for families in such a scenario must be aware not only of the rights and interests of both fetus and mother, but of the responsibilities of all of those interested--the family, the caregivers, and society. Full ethical analysis must include consideration of the effects of any decision on the overall health of the involved clients. While individual nurses will evaluate singular situations using different ethical guidelines, the primary ethical principle to be considered is how the autonomy of the individual pregnant woman is weighted vis a vis the interests of her fetus.

By understanding the functions and elements of informed consent, nurses can assist their patients to ask for and to comprehend the information they need to be truly and fully informed about treatment choices. Likewise, assessing the risks and benefits of an experimental treatment option, such as an experimental drug for the treatment of primary hypertension, may be important to the long-term health of patients. Nurses assist patient decision making and the assessment of relevant risks and benefits by being fully informed about the planned research and by applying knowledge of ethical principles to patient care.

The essence of much of our concern about caring for older women is that we have views about their care that reflect our understanding of what it means to be professionals who have a social contract with our clients. We have discussed nursing ethics as a process that occurs within a social context that emphasizes working to maximize self-determination and informed choices for older women. We have emphasized autonomy and a perspective that places the nurse in an advocacy position with the patient in a relationship of partners. Arriving at reasoned positions on the ethical issues in the care of older women leads to agreement with Gloria Steinem that women may be the one group that grows more radical with age.\r"

  ".U": "90068106\r", 
  ".W": "The laws pertaining to organ donation and transplantation are new, innovative, and rapidly evolving. Over the past 9 years, the field has become increasingly legislated and regulated, more formalized, and more organized. Heart transplant centers must be certified in order to receive Medicare funding. OPOs must comply with UNOS policies and procedures in order to receive reimbursement. Cyclosporine is available to many more patients as a result of government funding. Donated organs must be shared according to specific criteria designed to ration these valuable national resources equitably and efficiently. The field of transplantation faces many challenges in the future. Perhaps one of the most ominous is the threat of increased litigation. Transplantation is no longer considered experimental, and patients are increasingly aware of their rights. The sheer increase in numbers of procedures will afford opportunities for lawsuits. Living related donors have a right to safe, reasonable, and effective treatment, irrespective of their donor status. Recipients have the right to receive viable, functioning organs free of infections and diseases. The law has defined a duty to question and test potential donors to reduce the possibility of transmission of disease and infection. Recipients and live donors have the right to provide informed consent. The physician has the duty to inform the patient of all inherent risks. Recipients also have the right to expect that their transplant will be performed at a level of competency in keeping with the national standard. Despite all the legal, medical, technical, and ethical activity devoted to the field of transplantation, one perplexing problem persists--the shortage of donated organs. Many more patients are availing themselves of the therapeutic effects of transplantation. Unfortunately, organ donation has not experienced a corresponding increase. The Uniform Anatomical Gifts Act of 1968 failed at its mission to increase, substantially, the numbers of donated organs. Required request legislation has increased the numbers of donor families who are afforded the opportunity to donate. However, many patients die in hospitals under circumstances permitting organ donation, and their families are never approached. Perhaps the 1987 amendments to the UAGA, once accepted by more states, will afford greater flexibility and a corresponding increase in donorship. If the spirit of cooperation fails, transplant programs and OPOs may be forced to request meaningful sanctions for noncompliance.\r"

Improvement in the effectiveness of transplantation is dependent upon these two areas. The cadaver donor pool needs to be increased not only to allow every person waiting for transplant of a kidney, but to ensure a well-matched kidney. Better immunosuppression that will increase graft survival and decrease side effects is an important area of research at this time. We have come a long way in the 27 years that immunosuppression has been used and in the 35 years that kidney transplants have been performed in this nation. We can hope that the next 35 years bring improvements in the science of kidney transplantation.\r"

Perhaps this is the case because it bears some resemblance to the nursing process, which is taught in a similar fashion. Thus, a deductivist method of ethical decision making fits within the same general schema of the hypotheticodeductive method of decision making that is taught for nursing diagnosis. Ethics requires that nurses respect persons, inform patients and secure their consent, not inflict harm, preserve the patient's quality of life, prevent harm and remove harmful conditions, do good for patients, and minimize risk to themselves. These are among the norms of obligation that guide ethical analysis and judgment in nursing practice and are the substance of the analytical model of ethical decision making. Nursing's ethics has established high ideals and strong demands for nurses. These are demands which nurses have met and ideals which have often been realized. Whatever the strength of our science, nursing is an inherently moral endeavor and is only as strong as its commitment to its ethical obligations and values. Between the grinding edges of the forces that affect it, nursing must establish its priorities among the aspects of its environment that it attempts to control. Ethics must be chief among those priorities.\r"

  ".U": "90068117\r", 
  ".W": "This discussion of nurse advocacy and infant suffering in neonatal intensive care was based on content analysis of interviews of 20 neonatal nurses in three NICUs over a period of 6 years. Throughout that span of time, nurses experienced significant emotional distress when they believed that therapies resulted in infant suffering without proportional benefit. In all of the nurses interviewed, infant suffering triggered a variety of acts of advocacy, ranging from changes in nursing care to decrease infant distress to formal requests that the medical plan of care be reviewed. Characteristics of infants, nurses, and the NICU organization were described as possibly influential to nurse advocacy. Finally, some thoughts about an ethic of the good were presented. Gajardo-Velasquez noted, \"Nothing really great and important can be obtained without a certain amount of sacrifice; therefore, suffering is present in every human action that tends to transform and create new conditions for life.\" Our technology in the NICU has saved many lives and prevented much suffering and avoidable disability. It has also, for some, been a source of profound suffering. It is hoped that nurses in neonatal intensive care will use the ideas presented here as a starting point for their individual and collective examination of what constitutes an ethic of the good. Perhaps such an ethic can minimize the cost in suffering of the powerful technology of neonatal intensive care.\r"

Awareness of commonly experienced dilemmas and understanding of a model available to analyze and resolve these dilemmas can benefit patients and perioperative nurses. Patients will benefit from nurse advocates who recognize and act to resolve actual and potential ethical dilemmas. Nurses will benefit when they are empowered with the knowledge and ethical skills to enhance patient autonomy, to protect dignity and confidentiality, and human rights. Perioperative nurses should reflect on previous dilemmas and use them to assist with resolution of similar dilemmas. They should be knowledgeable of personal, departmental, institutional, and professional resources available when faced with ethical dilemmas. The ANA code for Nurses and the AORN Statements of Competency in Perioperative Nursing are two resources available to perioperative nurses. In the increasingly complex, technologically laden surgical environment, patients who are sicker and living longer will require services of highly skilled and educated professionals. They are vulnerable in the surgical setting and need surgical teams to act on their behalf. Perioperative nurses with ethical skill are an asset to patients and other members of the surgical team when they seek to resolve ethical dilemmas in knowledgeable and systematic ways.\r"

We recommend the use of commercially available rather than homemade solutions. Antibiotic and antidiarrheal agents are usually not indicated. Early reintroduction of milk, formula, or solid food is important, as is instruction of parents in measures to minimize transmission of infectious agents.\r"

Alterations in anatomy can be identified at the level of the secondary pulmonary lobule, and although often nonspecific, in certain situations high-resolution CT findings can be diagnostic. High-resolution CT scanning is also helpful in identifying patients who have significant lung disease despite a normal chest radiograph, and in planning biopsy procedures.\r"

  ".W": "CT remains the modality of choice for evaluating patients with a thoracic malignancy. In specific cases MR imaging can provide useful information that cannot be obtained with CT, and thus is useful as a problem solving tool. Advantages of MR imaging include superb demonstration of vessels and vessel/mass relationships, direct multiplanar imaging capability, and the potential for tissue characterization. MR imaging is useful in staging the patient with lung cancer when vascular or mediastinal invasion is in question. Its specific applications in surgical planning include the question of chest wall invasion, brachial plexus involvement, and transgression of the diaphragm, pericardium, or lung apex. Multiplanar imaging is useful in radiation therapy planning, displaying lesion extent in a coronal or sagittal format rather than on multiple axial images. Multiplanar capability also resolves problem areas for CT such as the aortopulmonic window, subcarinal region, and lesions at the cervicothoracic or thoracoabdominal junction. Structures such as the trachea and superior vena cava can be evaluated in their plane of anatomic orientation. Routine spin-echo and fast (GRASS) imaging of mediastinal vessels is useful in the evaluation of venous thrombosis as a result of catheters or tumors. The diagnosis and follow-up are obtained without the use of intravenous contrast material or radiation. When CT cannot evaluate vessels adequately because of surgical clip artifacts or postoperative distortion of anatomy, MR imaging is useful in the determination of vessel patency as well as identification of tumor recurrence. Cardiac masses are very well demonstrated by MR imaging. A unique feature of MR imaging is its potential for tissue characterization and ability to assess disease activity. Lymphoma evaluation is an active area of research. MR imaging can evaluate the radiated patient for tumor response and recurrence. Fibrous tissue remains of low signal intensity on T2-weighted images, whereas tumor has increased signal intensity. MR imaging may detect tumor recurrence before an increase in the size of a residual lymphoma mass and before clinical recurrence is evident. The area of increased signal can also serve as a guide to the appropriate site for biopsy to confirm recurrence. In addition, MR imaging can help characterize some adrenal and liver masses, potentially helping to avoid more invasive diagnostic procedures. At the current time MR spectroscopy does not have a clinical role in thoracic malignancies, but it may be a powerful tool in the future for diagnosis and management.\r"

In the evaluation of the pulmonary arteries of patients with pulmonary artery or right ventricular outflow tract obstructive lesions, MR imaging has become a frequently used noninvasive imaging technique for determining pulmonary artery configuration and for monitoring pulmonary artery growth. The large field of view and high-quality images afforded by MR imaging make it a useful diagnostic tool that can supplement, confirm, and in some instances supplant the use of other conventional imaging techniques.\r"

The major limitation at present is its inability to screen for coronary artery disease and evaluate ventricular function under stress. The future promises routine quantification of aortic, pulmonic, and other vascular flow rates, ultrafast (seconds) to real-time imaging, and paramagnetic or magnetic susceptibility perfusion markers. With the combination of real-time imaging and magnetic perfusion agents, imaging to detect coronary artery disease should also be possible. The use of pharmacologic stress or possibly physical stress with real-time imaging may also make this a reality in the not-too-distant future. MR coronary angiography remains a theoretical possibility but requires significant technologic advances, and is thus more remote. Existing and developing technology, however, seems to indicate that in the near-to-intermediate term, dynamic MR imaging will be an effective tool for evaluating almost all major types of cardiovascular disease.\r"

Identification of even small effusions is important because these commonly occur and may have clinical significance. The development of improved antibiotics and a wider range of interventional techniques has increased the reliance on the radiologic imaging of pleural disease in order to plan appropriate therapy. The newer imaging modalities of CT and sonography have proved to be particularly valuable in detecting small effusions and demonstrating single or multiple loculations. Additional features, such as the degree to which a pleural process has become organized and whether there is adjacent lung parenchymal disease, are well assessed on CT. Experience with MR has been limited, but preliminary data suggest that it may be a valuable addition and/or alternative to CT.\r"
