  ".W": "The study aimed to determine the predominant defense style in parents who abuse their children, at least as determined by a new defense style questionnaire. The scores of 32 parents who had physically abused their young children and had been assessed after court proceedings were compared with a normal population sample and with patients with anxiety disorders who were equally symptomatic. Parents who had abused their children identified themselves as being particularly likely to use projection, displacement, passive-aggressiveness denial, and splitting to a degree greater than normal persons or patients with anxiety disorders. We would caution that, although the differences remained after statistical control of age and sex differences, a firm conclusion that such defenses are germane to child abuse will have to await replication of these findings with a study using a control group of young parents who do not abuse their children matched for social class and family structure.\r"

The ring is rotated concentrically to the detector for three-dimensional reconstruction over a 21.4 cm (diameter) by 10.7 cm (length) field of view. We evaluated the system clinically by imaging a Hoffman brain phantom and seven subjects, of whom two were normal controls, three had previous cerebral infarction and two had dementia. The ASPECT system produced tomographic images of high spatial resolution. In normal subjects, the separation of striata from thalami by the posterior limbs of the internal capsules was much clearer on ASPECT images than on rotating gamma camera images. The high spatial resolution obtained with the ASPECT system translates into superior anatomical representation of the brain compared to the standard rotating gamma camera.\r"

  ".W": "Sphincter of Oddi (SO) dysfunction presents with vague abdominal pain and/or abnormal liver function tests, and is presumably due to SO stenosis or spasm. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging methods of diagnosis have been less than ideal. Initially, we determined normal quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy (QHBS) parameters both pre- and post-sincalide administration. Thirty-one \"normals\" were analyzed, and post-sincalide common bile duct (CBD) dynamics could be satisfactorily determined in 29 (94%) subjects. Normal values at sincalide-augmented QHBS are reported. Next, 10 patients suspected of having SO dysfunction were studied prospectively using SO manometry and QHBS. The two tests were in agreement in seven cases (4: normal CBD dynamics, 3: abnormal). In one case of advanced SO stenosis, QHBS was abnormal, but SO manometry could not be performed. In the two remaining cases, SO manometry and QHBS gave discordant results. Of greatest importance, no significant correlation existed between the quantitative parameters of these two tests. Sincalide-augmented QHBS is possible and may, in the future, be of value in the diagnosis of SO dysfunction and/or partial CBD obstruction.\r"

FSA was measured on scintiscans obtained at 3 and 24 hr postinjection of indium-111-labeled granulocytes. One hundred and twenty-two scans were acquired in 96 patients who were divided into six groups: Gr. I = normal volunteers (n = 10); Gr. II = inflammatory rheumatism (n = 10); Gr. III = abscesses (n = 17); Gr. IV = ulcerative colitis (UC: n = 23); Gr. V = colonic Crohn's disease (CCD: n = 22); and Gr. VI = ileal Crohn's disease (ICD: n = 14). FSA for Groups I and II was constantly below 10%, but it was increased in the other four groups (abscesses: 39% +/- 12%; UC: 35% +/- 13.5%; CCD: 23.7% +/- 14.7%; ICD: 21.5% +/- 11.7%). There was a significant correlation between fecal excretion of 111In (FEI) and FSA in patients with IBD (UC: r = 0.71, p less than 0.001; CCD: r = 0.74, p less than 0.001; ICD: r = 0.43, p less than 0.001). FSA was followed in 16 patients with IBD after medical treatment and there was a significant correlation between variations in FSA and in FEI (r = 0.879, p less than 0.001). FSA is a very sensitive although nonspecific index of disease activity in IBD and may replace FEI in the assessment of IBD activity.\r"

Two patients exhibited only modest thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, the most sensitive indices of radiation toxicity, after receiving 261 and 407 mCi, and 83 and 104 rad of whole-body radiation. One patient died of progressive neuroblastoma; the other two patients have stable disease over 30 mo after treatment. Per millicurie given, [125I]MIBG imparts about one-fourth the radiation dose of [131I]MIBG to the whole body. Iodine-125-MIBG can be given in doses that impart over 100 rad of whole-body radiation and that exceed 400 mCi before toxicity becomes limiting, even in small children.\r"

In this study, we have evaluated the effect of erythromycin on patients with delayed gastric emptying and healthy subjects using the dual radionuclide technique. Twelve patients with gastroparesis diabeticorum and ten healthy age- and sex-matched controls were studied. Gastric emptying of solids and liquids was determined using 99mTc-SC scrambled egg and 111In-DTPA in water. Following a baseline study and on a separate day, each patient and control received a 15-min i.v. perfusion of erythromycin starting at meal ingestion. Eleven out of the 12 patients were restudied after a 3-wk oral administration. In patients and controls, i.v. erythromycin dramatically accelerated gastric emptying of both solids and liquids which were emptied at the same rate. After chronic oral administration, solid and liquid emptying remained significantly accelerated. Erythromycin appears to be a very powerful gastrokinetic drug. Derived compounds with the gastrokinetic effect and without the antibiotic activity could be useful in dyspeptic patients with delayed gastric emptying.\r"

In this study, we have investigated the possible in vivo application of this radioligand in the detection of somatostatin receptor-bearing tumors by scintigraphy. The specific somatostatin-like biologic activity of radioiodinated Tyr-3-octreotide was confirmed in vitro: (a) radioiodinated Tyr-3-octreotide competes in the nanomolar range with specific receptor binding of somatostatin to suspended human meningioma membranes and (b) the secretion of growth hormone by cultured rat pituitary cells was similarly inhibited by iodinated Tyr-3-octreotide and somatostatin. In rats, intravenously injected 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide is rapidly cleared from the circulation mainly by the liver. Although this rapid clearance limits the amount of tracer available for somatostatin receptor-bearing tumors, the advantage of this rapid clearance is that the background level is rapidly reduced in favor of scintigraphic imaging of these tumors. Pancreatic tumors in rats were localized by scintigraphy after intravenous injection of 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide.\r"

Liver, kidney, and tumor were extracted and the supernatants, plasma and urine samples were analyzed by HPLC, ITLC, HPIEC and SDS-PAGE. By HPLC, the activity in normal tissue and tumor was associated principally with two major components. The first was native MAb and the second was a low molecular weight component (LMWF). On Day 1, the native-sized IgG was the predominant form (greater than 65%), but progressively decreased to less than 20% by Day 4. For the F(ab')2, even by Day 1 approximately 90% of the activity was associated with the LMWF. This LMWF was resolved further by HPIEC and SDS-PAGE into several metabolites that appear to be 111In-SCN-Bz-DTPA and 111In-SCN-Bz-DTPA bound to peptide fragments.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha emitter-labeled antibodies (Abs) are of considerable interest in cancer therapy. Alpha particles are densely ionizing and therefore have a high radiobiologic effectiveness, and the cell killing produced is influenced very little by dose rate or hypoxic conditions. LS174T human colon adenocarcinoma spheroids were used in this study to evaluate the efficacy of alpha emitter-labeled Abs in a three-dimensional model. NRLU-10, an IgG2b Ab to a pancarcinoma antigen, and its Fab fragment were used. Initial kinetic studies using 125I-NRLU-10 revealed that a large number of binding sites/cell and high Ab affinity led to slow Ab penetration. This effect could be overcome by increasing the Ab concentration ten-fold for Fab but not for intact Ab. Bismuth-212-NRLU-10 therapy was very effective in killing single cells (over 3 log reduction in surviving fraction) but was ineffective in spheroids (less than 1 log reduction). This was likely due to inadequate penetration into the spheroids before the 212Bi decayed. The use of higher Ab concentrations, tumors with fewer antigenic sites/cell for the Ab being used, lower affinity Abs, alpha emitters with longer half-lives, and pretargeting with bifunctional Ab are all potential ways of increasing the efficacy of alpha emitter-labeled Abs for cancer therapy.\r"

The highest concentrations in the estrogen target tissues and the highest target tissue-to-blood ratios were found with E-17 alpha-[Br]bromovinyl-11 beta-methoxyestradiol, but it also had rather high nonspecific uptake in all tissues. The triphenylethylene estrogen showed comparable specific uptake in estrogen target tissues to 17 alpha [77Br]bromovinylestradiol at 2 hr but better apparent retention, indicated by higher specific target tissue levels at the later time points. Thus, [77Br]bromovinyl-11 beta- methoxyestradiol and 1,1-bis[4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-[77Br]bromo-2-phenylethylene appear most favorable for these applications.\r"

A reconstructed emission image is used as an estimate of the source distribution in order to calculate the scatter contribution in the projection data. The scatter contribution is then subtracted from the original projection prior to attenuation correction. The attenuation correction method uses density maps for the attenuation correction of projection data. Simulation studies have been done with a clinically realistic source distribution in cylindrical, homogeneous water phantoms of different sizes and with photon energies corresponding to 201T1, 99mTc, and 111In. The results show excellent quantitative results with an accuracy within +/- 10% for most of the source positions and phantom sizes. It has also been shown that the variation in the event distribution within the source region in the images has been significantly decreased and that an enhancement in the contrast has been achieved.\r"

Twenty-four patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate treated with allogeneic bone grafts were examined by a surgeon, orthodontist, and prosthodontist 20 to 47 months after surgery. Radiographic and clinical examination of the periodontal status of the teeth adjacent to the cleft and their antimeres were compared for differences with Student's t test and the Wilcoxon test. Radiographs indicated complete bone bridging in 21 patients. Two of the remaining three patients had a 1-mm radiolucent gap in the cleft site. The third patient had a 6-mm-wide radiolucency and recurrence of an oronasal fistula which was regrafted with autogenous bone. No statistically significant differences between the cleft and noncleft tooth antimeres were found for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding, sulcus depth, or level of attachment. A statistically significant difference in the amount of attached gingiva was found between the cleft and noncleft tooth antimeres. Nine patients with missing lateral incisor teeth avoided prosthetic replacement by orthodontic movement of the canine tooth into the grafted edentulous space. In those cases where the maxillary canine was unerupted at the time of the surgery, eruption into the graft occurred. Stability of the maxillary segments was sufficient to allow prosthodontic restoration with a fixed partial denture in those cases where it was indicated.\r"

Pharmacologic strategies for minimizing the clinical manifestations of surgical trauma are often directed toward blocking the formation or inhibiting the effects of the biochemical mediators of acute inflammation. This study compared two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), flurbiprofen and ibuprofen, with a prototype glucocorticoid, methylprednisolone, in two replicate placebo-controlled studies for suppression of inflammation due to the surgical removal of impacted third molars. The results indicate that NSAIDs produce greater initial analgesia than do steroids, whereas steroids result in greater suppression of swelling and less loss of function. Examination of the pooled data from the two studies indicates that NSAID pretreatment results in a modest suppression of swelling in comparison with placebo. These data suggest that the acute analgesic effects of NSAIDs in the oral surgery model are due to suppression of a nociceptive process, presumably prostaglandin formation, rather than a generalized anti-inflammatory effect.\r"

The pathway of the nerve branches in the vicinity of the joint was reconstructed from serial sagittal or frontal histologic sections. The relationship between the joint components and the different nerves running in the vicinity of the joint was studied. The results revealed the existence of topographical prerequisites for mechanical influence upon the nerve branches passing in the TMJ region. In two joints, both with a displaced disc, the auriculotemporal nerve trunk was almost in contact with the medial aspect of the condyle instead of having its normal sheltered course at the level of the condylar neck, thus exposing the nerve to the risk of mechanical irritation during condylar movements in an anteromedial direction. Two joints with normal disc position had an extension of the medial fossa wall in a caudal direction. In these joints the auriculotemporal nerve had its course between the condyle and the elongated fossa wall, exposing it to the risk of mechanical irritation during medial disc displacement. Compression of the masseteric nerve anterior to the TMJ was found in one joint with excessive condylar translation. The deep posterior temporal nerves may pass close to the anterior insertion of the joint capsule on the temporal bone, exposing them to the risk of mechanical irritation when there is condylar hypermobility. It was also found that the inferior alveolar and the lingual nerves may pass close to the medial part of the condyle. In joints with this nerve topography, a medially displaced disc could interfere mechanically with these nerves. These findings could offer an explanation for the sharp, shooting pain felt locally in the joint with jaw movements and the pain and other sensations projecting to the terminal area of distribution of the nerve branches in the vicinity of the TMJ such as the ear, temple, cheek, tongue, and teeth.\r"

Eleven of 45 cases were found in an intraosseous location. Four of 45 reviewed neuromas were associated with extractions. All 4 cases were painful and 2 of them were in an intraosseous location. Only 3 of the 15 painful cases and 2 of the remaining asymptomatic 30 cases had a tentative clinical diagnosis of traumatic neuroma before removal.\r"

The median survival for patients diagnosed with KS alone was 17.0 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 8.7%. Poorer prognosis was found for patients with older age at diagnosis and with later year of diagnosis. Proportional hazards analysis indicated that age (p less than 0.001) and year of diagnosis (p less than 0.05) were significant independent predictors of survival, while race or ethnicity and risk group were not.\r"

To examine factors associated with the development of KS as compared to OI, we compared antecedent risk factors in 25 KS cases and 48 OI \"controls.\" In univariate analyses, several classical HIV risk factors including numbers of sexual partners and receptive anal intercourse were higher in the KS than the OI group. The strongest associations were found with an elevated number of sex partners in high-risk areas (San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York) in the 5 years prior to enrollment and with elevated use of nitrite inhalants. Logistic regression revealed the latter two variables and an elevated number of partners contacted in washrooms/parks to be significant, independent risk factors for KS relative to OI. Any or all of these variables could be related with early HIV infection. However, the association with early sexual contact in high-risk areas raises the more intriguing possibility that this variable is an indicator of an increased exposure either to a particular strain of HIV that is more pathogenic for KS, or, more likely, to a sexually transmitted KS cofactor that may have been more highly concentrated in these areas at this early point in the epidemic. The present study supports an independent association with use of nitrite inhalants, which could be hypothesized either to have an independent biologic effect on KS or to enhance the efficiency of transmission of the cofactor virus.\r"

In the first 4 years of the study, 84 seropositive men were observed to develop KS and 307 presented with an AIDS diagnosis other than KS. A systematic trend in the incidence of KS over time was not apparent in this population. The number of anal-receptive intercourse partners prior to diagnosis declined in a similar fashion for both AIDS groups. Although the number of partners with whom the men performed rimming decreased prior to diagnosis for both AIDS groups, a greater proportion of the KS AIDS group had performed this activity with multiple partners than had the non-KS AIDS group. Furthermore, history of oral gonorrhea was significantly (p = 0.027) more prevalent in the KS group. In addition, the KS AIDS group had lower cytomegalovirus antibody levels prior to diagnosis and higher levels of total immunoglobulin G. The groups did not differ with respect to baseline hematological measures, temporal trends in helper and suppressor T cells, or hepatitis B surface antigen or antibody. Given this profile of factors associated with the occurrence of KS, an infectious agent, in addition to HIV-1, is plausible as a proposed cofactor in the development of KS.\r"

For 250 men whose date of HIV seroconversion could be well characterized, persons presenting with KS had a shorter interval from HIV seroconversion to AIDS diagnosis than other AIDS patients without KS (mean = 77 vs. 86 months). Among 182 men who were interviewed prior to a diagnosis of AIDS, men with and without KS did not significantly differ with respect to number of sex partners, a history of certain sexually transmitted or enteric diseases, use of certain recreational drugs (including nitrite inhalants), or participation in certain specific sexual practices. The decline in KS may at least partly be due to a shorter latency period from infection to disease. Although cofactors for the development of KS may exist, many previously hypothesized agents were not supported by this analysis.\r"

The risk of KS was higher in HIV-1-infected homosexual men from New York City as compared with Washington, D.C. and was very low in the hemophilia subjects. While KS accounted for a decreasing proportion of AIDS cases in homosexual men, the absolute risk per year did not diminish. Survival was similar after diagnosis of KS vs. opportunistic infection including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Percent CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and beta 2-microglobulin levels were less abnormal in subjects who later developed KS than in those who developed opportunistic infections; conversely, serum neopterin abnormalities were greater in those who developed KS. The additional risk of KS in homosexual men may explain their apparently higher incidence of AIDS. Further investigation of the differences in intermediate markers of KS and opportunistic infections may shed light on the pathogenesis of these particular manifestations of AIDS.\r"

Of the 7,119 patients reported, 2,346 (33%) had been diagnosed as having KS: 1,716 (73%) as their presenting clinical manifestation of AIDS and 648 (27%) as a later manifestation. Of these 2,364 KS patients, 2,075 (88%) were homosexual or bisexual men without histories of intravenous drug use, and 273 (12%) were homosexual or bisexual intravenous drug users. From 1981 to August 1989, the proportion of AIDS patients presenting with KS declined from 55 to 19% (p less than 0.001). However, the number of patients being diagnosed with KS has increased along with the overall number of AIDS patients, but this increase was less than the increase in number of patients with other opportunistic infections and malignancies. KS patients were less likely than patients without KS to be reported through an active surveillance system and less likely to be found through retrospective reviews of medical records, death certificates, and obituaries. We conclude that the proportion of AIDS patients with KS is continuing to decline in San Francisco and that this decline is not an artifact of the AIDS surveillance system.\r"

HLA-DR5, reported by others to be increased in frequency in classical KS as well as HIV-1-related KS, was not found to be increased in the KS cohort. Antigen frequencies in the patients with KS differed from the frequencies in patients with OI by an increase in HLA-A23, -C4, -DR14, and -DR53.

Cells cultured in normal media expressed predominantly transient (T) currents whereas cells cultured in media with dimethylsulfoxide for 1 month expressed predominantly long-lasting (L) currents. Furthermore, by selecting cells with one or two short neurites it was possible to obtain cells which expressed only L channels. The dihydropyridine agonist, Bay K-8644 (5 microM), increased the amplitude of L channel currents by a factor of nearly two, whereas T channel currents were unaffected. Nifedipine (0.1 mM) significantly inhibited L channel currents, whereas T channel currents were insensitive to this treatment. Flunarizine, a diphenylpiperazine, had no effect on L channel currents but selectively inhibited T channel currents in a dose-dependent manner, with a significant effect at a concentration of 1 microM. However, flunarizine did not change the I-V relationships of T channel currents. Furthermore, the voltage dependence of T channel inactivation was shifted toward more negative potential by flunarizine. The present study provides direct evidence of the selective inhibition of T channel currents by flunarizine in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells.\r"

Downward slope of the contraction-response curve of 5-HT (greater than or equal to 10(-5) 5 M) was shifted to right in the presence of 8-OH-DPAT. 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT had no effect on the tension of unstimulated organs. Contractions elicited by ATP were potentiated by 5-HT, which was antagonized by ketanserin. 8-OH-DAPT did not affect ATP-elicited contractions. These results suggest the presence of presynaptic 5-HT1, maybe 5-HT1A and 5-HT3 receptors mediating inhibition and potentiation, respectively, of neurotransmitter release and of postsynaptic responsible for enhancing neurogenic contractions in mouse vas deferens.\r"

In electrically driven (1 Hz) guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes R-PIA concentration-dependently (0.0001-100 microM) reduced the stimulatory effects of isoprenaline (0.01 microM) on contractile response and on cAMP content. The A1-adenosine receptor antagonist DPCPX (0.3 microM) antagonized the effects of R-PIA on contractile reponse and on cAMP content, whereas the A2-adenosine receptor antagonist CGS 15943A (0.01 microM) was ineffective. NECA (0.0001-100 microM) reduced the effects of isoprenaline (0.01 microM) on contractile response to about the same extent as R-PIA. However, NECA did not change cAMP content. DPCPX (0.3 microM) antagonized the effects of NECA on contractile response and evoked a cAMP-increasing effect of NECA, which was 38% of the isoprenaline value at most. In contrast, CGS 15943A did not affect the reduction of contractile response induced by NECA, whereas CGS 15943A revealed a cAMP-decreasing effect of NECA (0.1-10 microM).

  ".W": "Ethanol has been shown to suppress calcium uptake into depolarized synaptosomes, to reduce the durations of calcium spikes in cultured cells and to reduce calcium conductances in invertebrate neurons. Voltage-activated calcium channels therefore appear to be an important target of ethanol action. However, the interactions of ethanol with specific types of calcium channels have yet to be defined. This study examined the effects of ethanol on two different populations of calcium channels in N1E-115 neuroblastoma and in NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells. Transient (type I) and long-lasting (type II) calcium channel currents were recorded with the whole-cell voltage clamp technique. At concentrations above 30 mM, ethanol reversibly suppressed both types of calcium channel currents, without changing the voltage dependence of activation. Concentration-response curves were essentially the same for type I and type II channels. Ethanol at concentrations of 100 and 300 mM blocked currents by approximately 15 and 40%, respectively. The voltage dependence of type I channel inactivation was not altered by ethanol concentrations as high as 300 mM, nor was there evidence of a use-dependent blocking action. The effects of ethanol on calcium channels were similar in NG108-15 cells; both channel types were blocked by ethanol at about the same concentrations as were effective in N1E-115 cells. Because ethanol interacts with opiate receptors in some systems, and leucine-enkephalin is known to block type II currents in NG108-15 cells, we examined whether the ethanol block of type II currents could be altered by naloxone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of S 9795 in vitro and determine whether S 9795 affects the autonomic nerves, the epithelium or the smooth muscle of the bronchial wall. S 9795 had an inhibitory effect on the contractile responses evoked by acetylcholine and by electrical stimulation of the cholinergic nerves. S 9795 appeared more potent against contractions evoked by nerve stimulation. In addition, S 9795 caused the release of [3H]norepinephrine from the adrenergic nerve endings but did not affect neuronal uptake of the catecholamine. At low concentrations, S 9795 acted as a competitive serotonergic antagonist; at higher concentrations, the compound inhibited noncompetitively the contractions evoked by histamine and acetylcholine. In both second and fourth order bronchi, S 9795 (and theophylline) produced concentration-dependent relaxations that were significantly greater in rings with, compared with rings without, epithelium. The compound also facilitated the epithelium-dependent component of the relaxation response to beta-adrenergic activation. These results suggest that S 9795: 1) causes prejunctional inhibition of the release of acetylcholine, 2) evokes the displacement of stored norepinephrine, 3) exerts a differential inhibitory effect on airway contractions induced by various bronchoconstrictors and 4) augments the release or facilitates the effect of the epithelium-derived relaxing factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study investigated ethanol reinforced behavior in mice selectively bred for high, Long Sleep/Institute for Behavioral Genetics (LS), and low, Short Sleep/Institute for Behavioral Genetics (SS), sensitivity to ethanol. Results show that both lines will drink large amounts of ethanol postprandially. However, in the absence of food presentation, LS and SS mice differed significantly in ethanol reinforced behavior. Ethanol maintained higher rates of responding, greater intake and higher blood ethanol levels in LS relative to SS mice across increasing fixed-ratio values. Ethanol did not maintain fixed-ratio lever pressing above rates maintained by vehicle in SS mice. Responding for and consumption of 8% ethanol significantly exceeded that of vehicle only in LS mice. Response rates of LS mice showed a typical inverted U-shaped relationship to ethanol concentration. Postsession blood ethanol levels and body temperatures indicated pharmacologically significant ethanol intake only in LS mice. Thus, ethanol served as an effective reinforcer in LS mice across a range of environmental conditions. Conversely, ethanol was not established as a positive reinforcer in SS mice under any of the broad range of conditions studied. These results are not consistent with the frequently reported negative correlation between ethanol intake and sensitivity to ethanol and rule out a causal basis for correlations seen between these traits.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of Ile,Ser-bradykinin (TK) on electrolyte secretion across mucosa of rat distal colon were determined and compared to those of bradykinin (BK). A segment of colon stripped of muscularis was mounted in an Ussing chamber for monitoring short-circuit current (Isc). Serosal application of TK and BK produced a concentration-dependent and transient increase in Isc with EC50(nM) values of 2.0 +/- 0.6 and 1.7 +/- 0.7, respectively. At a concentration of 1.0 microM, TK produced a maximal response of 130 +/- 18 compared to 75 +/- 13 microA/cm2 for BK. Increases in Isc induced by BK and TK were significantly (P less than .001) inhibited (90 +/- 4% for BK and 87 +/- 5% for TK) by serosal addition of bumetanide (10 microM). The lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase inhibitor, eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraynoic acid (0.1 mM), inhibited (P less than .01) the response to BK by 67 +/- 9% and to TK by 51 +/- 8%. Moreover, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (5.0 microM) significantly (P less than .05) inhibited the Isc response to 1.0 nM BK and 1.0 nM TK. Atropine (1.0 microM) did not block the effects of either kinin. Finally, the BK antagonist D-Arg0[Hyp3,Thi5,8,DPhe7]-bradykinin (2.0 microM) competitively antagonized the effect of BK and TK, shifting the concentration curve competitively to the right by 6-fold and 16-fold respectively. Another BK antagonist, [D-Phe7]-bradykinin (20 microM), also exhibited similar blockade effects. In this model, although some differences exist, BK and TK appear to act by the same mechanism, which may involve arachidonic acid metabolites.\r"

The decreased release can be due to stimulation of alpha-2 adrenoceptors or other receptors in the brain or due to stimulation of presynaptic inhibitory alpha-2 adrenoceptors on sympathetic nerve endings. To compare central and peripheral contributions to the depressor action of CLO, renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and renal spillover of NE (RNEs) were measured at baseline and during reflexive increases in RSNA evoked by nitroprusside-induced hypotension (27, 50 and 105 micrograms/kg/min) before and after CLO treatment in adrenal-demedullated, anesthetized rats. Administration of CLO decreased RSNA by 52 +/- 8% and RNEs by 32 +/- 13% (means +/- S.E.M.). At levels of RSNA less than 50% above control, there were no significant changes in RNEs; above this level of activity RNEs increased, regardless of CLO treatment. CLO treatment did not alter significantly the relationship between increases in RSNA and in RNEs during nitroprusside-induced hypotension. The results suggest that in neurologically intact, anesthetized animals, CLO decreases renal NE release mainly by inhibiting sympathetic outflow, with little if any peripheral presynaptic action.\r"

Tetrodotoxin significantly reduced mucosal responses whereas atropine and the H1 antagonists mepyramine and diphenhydramine had only marginal effects. None of these agents affected the responses of the epithelium to SP. Indomethacin significantly reduced responses in both preparations. Removal of Na+ or Cl- or the use of C- channel blockers (9-anthracene carboxylic acid and N-phenylanthranilic acid) produced a significant reduction of SP responses across the epithelium. Thus, SP has both direct and indirect affects on the colon; activation of the cyclooxygenase pathway could be significant.\r"

Immunohistologic analysis revealed graft structures that stained positively for a number of neuronal, transmitter-related, glial and vascular markers. Superfusion of ethanol (EtOH) elicited a reversible and dose-dependent depression of action potential discharge. At least two populations of neurons could be identified--a more sensitive group with an EC50 of 3.0 mM and a less sensitive group with an EC50 of 22.4 mM. These EtOH levels are within the range eliciting behavioral signs of intoxication in humans. EtOH-induced depressions could be antagonized by administration of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro 15-4513. This study represents the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of the electrophysiologic actions of EtOH on single neurons from human brain, and provides dose-response data collected with known concentrations of EtOH as well as evidence for the blockade of these EtOH effects by the Roche compound.\r"

To investigate the possible involvement of oxygen-derived metabolites in amiodarone-induced injury, 51Cr-labeled human pulmonary artery endothelial (HPAE) cells were incubated with amiodarone for 18 hr in the presence of various antioxidants and in hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions with cell injury quantified by 51Cr release, expressed as cytotoxic index. Amiodarone (10-50 microM) directly injured HPAE cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but the injury was not modulated by altering ambient oxygen concentrations. Furthermore, amiodarone-induced injury (30 microM) was not reduced by the following antioxidants: catalase, superoxide dismutase, ascorbic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide and ethanol. In contrast, toxicity from 30 microM amiodarone was significantly reduced by alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TOC) at 10, 20 and 40 microM from a cytotoxic index of 41.6 +/- 3.5 to 25.5 +/- 7.9, 10.61 +/- 5.4 and 3.1 +/- 2.8, respectively. As revealed by phase microscopy, alpha-TOC (40 microM) prevented any evidence of toxicity to the amiodarone-treated cells. Amiodarone concentrations in the HPAE cells incubated in the presence and absence of alpha-TOC were not significantly different, indicating that alpha-TOC did not interfere with the uptake of the drug by the cells. Similarly, amiodarone did not interfere with the uptake of alpha-TOC by the HPAE cells. Although the specific mechanism of action remains unclear, alpha-TOC affords nearly complete protection in vitro from the cellular injury induced by amiodarone.\r"

  ".W": "Thymopoietin is a 48 to 49 amino acid polypeptide hormone of the thymus, which regulates immune function. The present experiments show that the polypeptide can cause a complete block of transmission of the phrenic nerve diaphragm junction of the rat in vitro; contractile responses evoked by phrenic nerve stimulation were blocked by concentrations of thymopoietin as low as 10(-8) M. The thymopoietin-induced inhibition of indirectly evoked muscle contractions was dose- and time-dependent, with the polypeptide being only slightly less potent than alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT). Twitch responses to direct electrical stimulation of the muscle were not affected by thymopoietin, indicating that it did not inhibit muscle tension by an action on the muscle contractile mechanism per se. Furthermore, thymopoietin did not alter resting or stimulated release of acetylcholine from the phrenic nerve, suggesting that it did not interact at a presynaptic level. On the other hand, thymopoietin inhibited the binding of [125I]alpha-BGT to the nicotinic receptor of rat hemidiaphragm. In intact muscle tissue, the IC50 value for inhibition of [125I]alpha-BGT binding by thymopoietin was 2.1 x 10(-7) M, a value similar to the concentration of polypeptide required to inhibit phrenic nerve-induced muscle contraction (IC50 value, 0.75-1.6 x 10(-7) M). In a muscle membrane preparation, the potency of thymopoietin to affect [125I]alpha-BGT binding was increased (IC50 value, 0.35 nM); thus thymopoietin has the potential to interact at the nicotinic receptor in the nM range. To conclude, the present results show that thymopoietin inhibits neuromuscular activity by an effect that appears to be a specific interaction at the nicotinic receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This decrease did not appear to be due to the in vivo formation of the inactive cytochrome P-450 p Fe(II)-metabolite complex, since disruption of this complex with potassium ferricyanide did not increase estrogen hydroxylase activities. Troleandomycin administration, however, essentially suppressed cytochrome P-450 UT-A (one of the P-450 forms involved in the hydroxylation of estrogens) and resulted in the appearance of cytochrome P-450 forms whose estradiol hydroxylase activity was inhibitable by troleandomycin in vitro. Similarly, troleandomycin (2 mM) inhibited by 60% estradiol and ethinylestradiol 2/4-hydroxylase activities in microsomes from dexamethasone-treated rats, although it had no inhibitory effect in microsomes from control rats. In contrast, erythromycin and roxithromycin (2 mM) exerted no inhibitory effect, even in microsomes from dexamethasone-treated rats. In vivo, these macrolides (0.5 mmol.kg-1 p.o. daily for 5 days) decreased moderately cytochrome P-450 UT-A levels and estradiol 2/4-hydroxylase activity, and did not modify ethinylestradiol 2/4-hydroxylase activity. We conclude that the administration of troleandomycin, but not that of erythromycin or roxithromycin, decreases ethinylestradiol 2/4-hydroxylase activity in male rat liver microsomes, as a possible consequence of decreased cytochrome P-450 UT-A levels and of the induction of glucocorticoid-responsive P-450 forms whose ethinylestradiol hydroxylase activity is inhibitable by troleandomycin.\r"

  ".W": "Rat platelets and adipocytes were used as models to investigate alterations of the A2- and of the A1-adenosine receptor-adenylate cyclase system of peripheral cells caused by chronic caffeine administration. The maximum effects of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in suspensions of platelet membranes and to inhibit aggregation were significantly greater with platelets from caffeine-treated rats than from control rats. The effects of 1 to 100 nM prostaglandin E1 to inhibit platelet aggregation and to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in platelet membranes were also significantly greater with caffeine-treated than with control rats. These data suggest that the increased ability of NECA to inhibit platelet aggregation after chronic caffeine ingestion was a result of increased cyclic AMP accumulation induced by this agonist. The increased stimulatory effect of NECA on adenylate cyclase in platelet membranes could be due to an increased A2-adenosine receptor number and/or an increased functional coupling between A2-adenosine receptor and stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding proteins. In contrast, although A1-receptor number was 37% higher in fat cell membranes from caffeine-treated rats than in those from control rats, increased A1-adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition of lipolysis and of adenylate cyclase was not detected. Thus, chronic caffeine consumption causes alterations in the response of some but not all peripheral cell types to agonists of adenosine receptors.\r"

The densities of beta-1 but not beta-2 adrenoreceptors were increased in hypothalamus (anterior and lateral nuclei), thalamus (ventral posterior nucleus) and amygdala (basolateral nucleus) of the STZ diabetic rats. In contrast, a decrease in the rate of metabolism of NE (estimated by the concentration of the NE metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol) was observed in these STZ-treated animals. Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone and testosterone were lower in the STZ diabetic rats. Pretreatment of rats with nicotinamide prevented the induction of hyperglycemia, upregulation of brain beta-1 adrenoreceptors, decreases in NE metabolism and reduction in serum levels of luteinizing hormone and testosterone seen in STZ-treated rats. These data suggest that derangements in the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis seen in uncontrolled diabetes may be secondary to decreases in NE metabolism and compensatory upregulation of beta-1 adrenoreceptors in brain.\r"

The respiratory effects of caffeine, theophylline, 8-phenyltheophylline (8-PT), 8-cyclopentyltheophylline (8-CPT), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and enprofylline, as well as the nonxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor, rolipram, and the adenosine analogs, N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA), were studied in unanesthetized rhesus monkeys. Ventilation was measured continuously by enclosing the monkey's head in a fitted Lexan helmet while a pressure transducer measured differences in pressure produced by inspirations and expirations against a constant flow of air. Drugs were administered (i.m.) using cumulative-dosing procedures while the subjects breathed air or 5% CO2 mixed in air. All xanthines except 8-PT produced dose-related increases in respiratory frequency and less pronounced changes in tidal volume, both in air and in 5% CO2 mixed in air. 8-PT, an adenosine antagonist with little activity as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, did not have respiratory effects over the range of doses studied. Enprofylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with little activity as an adenosine antagonist, had effects that were comparable to those of caffeine. Rolipram also had effects on respiration that were similar to those of caffeine, and it was approximately 100 times more potent than caffeine. The adenosine A1/A2 agonist, NECA, produced dose-related increases in respiratory frequency, and both CPA (an A1-selective agonist) and NECA produced dose-related decreases in tidal volume; NECA was 30 to 100 times more potent than CPA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

[D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) inhibited the contraction and the release of ACh evoked by 0.2 and 1 Hz of electrical stimulation (ES), whereas the response to 5 Hz was enhanced by low concentrations of DAMGO (10(-9) to 10(-8) M) and inhibited by high concentrations (10(-7) to 10(-5) M); naloxone antagonized these effects. In preparations treated with yohimbine, DAMGO inhibited the ES (5 Hz)-evoked contraction and ACh release, but failed to enhance either effect. Dynorphin-A inhibited the contraction and ACh release evoked by 0.2, 1 and 5 Hz of ES, and the effect of dynorphin-A was mimicked by U-69593 [5 alpha,7 alpha,8 beta-(-)-N-methyl-N-[7- (pyrrolinyl)-1-ozaspiro(4,5)dec-8-yl]-benzene] and antagonized by MR 2266 [(-)-alpha-5,9-diethyl-2-(3-furylmethyl)-2'-hydroxy-6,7-benzomorphan]. The release of norepinephrine evoked by 5 Hz of ES was inhibited by DAMGO (10(-10) to 10(-6) M), but not by U-69593, and the effect of DAMGO was antagonized by naloxone. Thus, it would appear that mu-opioid receptors are present on both cholinergic and adrenergic neurons, whereas kappa-opioid receptors are present on cholinergic neurons. The affinity of DAMGO was 30 times higher for the mu-opioid receptors on the adrenergic than on the cholinergic neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension is a serious side-effect of the clinical use of Cyclosporin A (CsA). One notion is that alterations of vascular reactivity contribute to this hypertension. In this study we used the isolated rat mesenteric vascular bed to test the specific hypothesis that CsA modifies vascular calcium regulation to potentiate vascular contractility. Mesenteric vessels from CsA-treated rats (10 mg/kg/day i.m. for 7 days) exhibited significantly greater vasoconstrictor responses to exogenous norepinephrine (NE) and potassium-induced depolarization than those of vehicle-treated animals. Similarly, in vitro CsA (8.3 X 10(-8) to 8.3 X 10(-6) M) augmented in a concentration-dependent manner both the sensitivity and the maximum response to NE and potassium. This effect of CsA on vasoconstriction was critically dependent on the presence of external calcium [( Ca++]o). The degree of vasoconstriction potentiation correlated significantly with the [Ca++]o which was used during exposure of the mesenteric bed to CsA. Reapplication of external calcium in the presence of CsA to \"calcium-depleted\" preparations increased significantly the amplitude of subsequent NE responses in a calcium-free medium. Thus, CsA-potentiated NE responses, once established, were not reversed by removing external calcium; however, attenuation occurred with the intracellular calcium antagonist dantrolene. Verapamil and nifedipine blocked potassium-elicited responses, but failed to prevent the CsA effect on NE-induced vasoconstriction. We conclude that CsA potentiation of vasoconstriction depends on extracellular calcium, and results from an enhanced transmembrane calcium transport. We speculate that CsA also increases the filling of intracellular stores of releasable calcium. These effects lead to greater calcium influx and greater intracellular calcium release upon stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of several i.c.v.-administered FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2)-like peptides (FaRPs) on mouse colonic propulsive motility was examined. Dose-related inhibition of propulsive motility (measured as an increase in the time of colonic bead expulsion) was produced by analogs with either the sequence (-)F[X]RFamide or with the FMRFamide sequence containing D-amino acid substitutions. The C-terminal dipeptide sequence Arg-Phe-NH2 was sufficient to produce this effect. D-amino acid substitution in the second position, i.e., [D-Met2]-FMRFamide (DMFa), conferred significantly enhanced activity (nearly maximal obtainable response under the test conditions) in this preparation (ED25 = 2.3 micrograms = 3.8 nmol). DMFa did not block the action of morphine but, like morphine, was blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone and was attenuated by 24-hr pretreatment with the selective mu-1 opioid antagonist naloxonazine (35 mg/kg s.c.). It is concluded that a variety of FaRPs, particularly those with a nonpolar residue in the first position and with Arg in the third position, behave as opioid-like agonists, not antagonists, on mouse colonic propulsive motility. DMFa is identified as the most active FaRP studied to date on this endpoint.\r"

  ".W": "Nonadrenergic, noncholinergic contractile responses of guinea pig hilar bronchi to transmural electrical stimulation (TES) have been suggested to be due to release of endogenous tachykinins from capsaicin-sensitive neurons (C-fibers). Thiorphan and phosphoramidon, inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (NEP, the major enzyme responsible for degrading tachykinins), were found to potentiate contractile responses of this isolated airway segment to TES and exogenously applied capsaicin, substance P and neurokinin A. However, the magnitude of potentiation by either inhibitor was smaller for TES and capsaicin (less than 10-fold leftward shift) than for the substrate agonists (about 100-fold leftward shift). This quantitative difference in potentiation by NEP inhibitors does not appear to be due to an influence of vasoactive intestinal peptide or calcitonin gene-related peptide, two endogenous peptides that might be released concomitantly by TES. Neither peptide caused marked effects on contractile responses to TES or tachykinins when applied to the isolated tissues. Addition of inhibitors of serine proteases, aminopeptidases, acetylcholinesterase and angiotensin-converting enzyme failed to further potentiate responses to TES in the presence of thiorphan. Therefore, the contractile response does not appear to be further modified by the activity of these peptidases. Neuropeptide gamma, but not neuropeptide K, was potentiated by thiorphan. The data suggest that peptides that are not substrates for NEP (for example, neuropeptide K) may also be released by TES from capsaicin-sensitive neurons to cause contraction. This may, at least in part, explain the quantitative difference in potentiation by NEP inhibitors of contractile responses to TES and to exogenously applied NEP-sensitive tachykinins in the guinea pig hilar bronchus.\r"

At very young ages, up to about 35 days of age, the mice differ in sleep time response to ethanol, but this difference is due to the development of acute tolerance. At older ages the differences in sleep times are due to a combination of acute tolerance and differences in initial sensitivity. In contrast to adult mice, that show no difference in brain sensitivity to pentobarbital, short-sleep mouse pups ranging in age from days 9 to 12 are more sensitive to pentobarbital than are long-sleep mice. The difference in sensitivity at young ages is again due to differences in development of acute tolerance and not to initial sensitivity differences. It is postulated that the development of acute tolerance to ethanol is rapid, within minutes, following injection of ethanol and that the system responsible might be the gamma-amino-butyric acid-mediated chloride flux which has also been shown to develop tolerance within 5 min after ethanol injection.\r"

In this study we investigated the modulation of opioid tolerance by NLX in acutely tolerant mice (a single dose of 100 mg/kg of MS s.c.). When acutely tolerant mice were injected 3 hr later with 32 mg/kg of NLX, tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of MS could be observed for at least 12 days after MS injection. The same dose of NLX given 3 days after MS injection also led to the prolongation of MS tolerance whereas 4 mg/kg of NLX had no effect. By using the latter protocol, if the ineffective 4-mg/kg dose of NLX was preceded 2 hr before with 10 mg/kg of MS, tolerance to MS could be detected for at least 6 days. When this protracted tolerance (100 mg/kg of MS followed 3 hr later by 32 mg/kg of NLX) was studied at spinal and supraspinal sites, tolerance to MS at supraspinal sites was greater and more prolonged than at spinal sites. [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin did not show cross-tolerance at either site. U50,488H [trans-(+/-)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1- pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide) showed a slowly developing cross-tolerance only at the supraspinal sites. In acutely tolerant animals, the tolerance that developed at supraspinal and spinal sites was of equal magnitude and contributed additively to the total tolerance observed in the animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two hours later various doses of NLX were injected s.c. to precipitate jumping behavior, a sign of withdrawal and ED50 values of NLX were determined. Twenty-four and 72 hr after the MS pretreatment, NLX ED50 values were 18 and 21 mg/kg, respectively, which were significantly lower than those of the control groups which did not receive the 100 mg/kg of MS pretreatment. If the withdrawn mice were reprimed with a 10 mg/kg s.c. dose of MS 24 and 72 hr after the first priming dose, they displayed even more sensitivity to NLX with the NLX ED50 values lowered to 3 and 4 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, mice pretreated with 100 mg/kg of MS and treated with 32 mg/kg of NLX either 1 or 3 days later required smaller amounts of NLX to precipitate withdrawal after the priming dose of MS. NLX ED50 values in the former group were 5 and 4 mg/kg 24 and 72 hr after MS injection, respectively. In the latter group NLX ED50 values were 2, 19 and 25 mg/kg after 4, 6 and 9 days after MS injection, respectively. All these values were significantly lower than those of control groups which did not receive NLX at 3 or 72 hr after 100 mg/kg of MS. These results suggest that administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone in morphine-pretreated mice can lead to the maintenance of the dependent state.\r"

Propranolol and acebutolol, which possess a membrane-stabilizing action, and atenolol and metoprolol, which lack this action, were used in the isolated, perfused rabbit heart. The membrane-stabilizing effects of these agents were assessed on the basis of the effects on the maximal driving frequency of the left atria. Reoxygenation of hearts for 45 min following 20-min hypoxia resulted in little recovery of cardiac contractile force, sustained rise in resting tension, insufficient recovery of myocardial high-energy phosphates, accumulation of the tissue calcium and sodium and marked release of creatine kinase and ATP metabolites from the hearts. Treatment of hypoxic hearts with either 100 microM propranolol, 200 microM acebutolol, 200 microM atenolol or 100 microM metoprolol was commenced when the contractile force declined to 30% of the initial level and terminated at 20-min hypoxia. Treatment with either propranolol or acebutolol produced a significant posthypoxic recovery of cardiac contractile force, resting tension and myocardial high-energy phosphates, and a profound suppression of the tissue calcium and sodium accumulation and the loss of ATP metabolites from perfused hearts. In contrast, neither atenolol nor metoprolol affected these changes induced by the hypoxic insult and the following reoxygenation. The results suggest that membrane-stabilizing action of beta blocking agents plays an important role in the protection against posthypoxic cardiac contractile dysfunction and metabolic disturbances.\r"

  ".W": "Rats given morphine (8 mg/kg i.v.) followed after 2 hr by infusions of morphine (4 mg/kg i.v.) every 2 hr for 24 hr (total infusion time of 2 min for each infusion) became dependent on morphine. Injection of the opiate antagonist naloxone (5 mg/kg) precipitated a withdrawal response including an increase in mean arterial blood pressure (BP), biphasic heart rate response and an increase in plasma norepinephrine (NE) and Epinephrine (Epi). Plasma Epi was also higher after abrupt withdrawal from morphine. After removal of adrenal glands from morphine-dependent rats, naloxone injection produced no change in the BP or plasma Epi. However, naloxone injection to morphine-dependent rats treated with phentolamine to block the alpha receptor-mediated effects of circulating catecholamines led to a significant decrease in BP even though plasma Epi increased 8-fold. In morphine-dependent rats in which NE levels in sympathetic nerves have been reduced by prior exposure to 6-hydroxydopamine, naloxone produced a biphasic BP response, an initial decrease followed by an increase along with a 3-fold increase in plasma Epi. These results suggest that Epi released from the adrenal medulla of morphine-dependent rats mediates, in large part, the autonomic withdrawal responses elicited by naloxone. Naloxone injection to control and morphine-dependent rats produced similar increases in plasma NE (2-fold) indicating that the increase in plasma NE is not responsible for the withdrawal response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Topical application (100 microliters) of acetylcholine (0.01 microgram) or nitric oxide (0.06-6 micrograms) caused vasodilator responses that were inhibited (P less than .05, n = 6-8) 64% and 30 to 100%, respectively, by suffusion of the preparation with 5 microM methylene blue. Agents that are thought to produce activation of guanylate cyclase via cellular metabolism to nitric oxide, nitroglycerin (0.5 ng-0.5 microgram) or nitroprusside (0.5 ng-0.5 microgram), also produced vasodilation.

The inhibition of vasodilation to acetylcholine or nitric oxide by methylene blue was completely prevented by suffusion of superoxide dismutase, but not affected by suffusion of catalase. Based on the current conceptualization of the mechanism of action of these vasodilator agents in isolated larger blood vessels, methylene blue appears to inhibit responses in this skeletal muscle microcirculatory preparation through the extracellular generation of superoxide anion and not via a direct interaction with guanylate cyclase.\r"

All the parameters of [3H]RX821002 binding were consistent with the labeling of an alpha-2 adrenoceptor. The use of this probe was moreover extremely convenient, because contrarily to [3H]yohimbine and [3H]rauwolscine, [3H]RX821002 displayed in this tissue a very high affinity (Kd = 0.54 +/- 0.12 nM) and a low level of nonspecific binding (5% at 1 nM [3H]RX821002). Competition studies with various antagonists and agonists showed that the labeled sites were alpha-2-selective and stereospecific. Oxymetazoline was much more potent than chlorpromazine or prazosin suggesting that the receptor is of the alpha-2-subtype. Yohimbine and rauwolscine were equipotent, which is also in agreement with the pharmacological definition of this subtype. These two compounds displayed, however, a rather weak affinity (Ki approximately 40 nM), which is somewhat different with what one should expect for a true alpha-2A adrenoceptor. Altogether the competition data indicated that the alpha-2 adrenoceptor from rat jejunal epithelium is neither an alpha-2A, nor an alpha-2B, nor an alpha-2c adrenoceptor and may belong to a fourth subtype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study we investigated the time course of the effects of carbachol on force of contraction and phosphoinositide products in electrically driven left auricles from guinea pig hearts after pretreatment with pertussis toxin (180 micrograms/kg i.v.; 24 hr). Inositol phosphates and phosphatidylinositols were labeled with [3H]inositol and separated with high-performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography, respectively. All experiments were performed in the presence of LiCl (10 mmol/l). The positive inotropic effect of carbachol (10 mumol/l) began within 2 min and was maximal within 15 min. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate rose within 1 min followed by an increase in inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and inositol 1-phosphate beginning within 2 min. It is concluded that the carbachol-induced positive inotropic effect is associated with an increase in the presumed second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. Since the increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate precedes the increase in force of contraction, it may initiate the positive inotropic effect. The increase in inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate may be involved in maintaining the positive inotropic effect of carbachol.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of alpha,beta-methylene ATP, an agent known to stimulate and then to desensitize P2-purinoceptors, on the release of endogenous norepinephrine from the electrically stimulated rat caudal artery were determined. Norepinephrine was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection techniques. alpha,beta-Methylene ATP over the concentration range of 1 to 100 microM did not affect the release of norepinephrine evoked by stimulation for 3 min at 1 Hz. In contrast, 2-chloroadenosine, a P1 receptor agonist, and beta,gamma-methylene ATP, a P2 receptor agonist, produced a concentration-related inhibition of the release of norepinephrine presumably by activating prejunctional purinoceptors. The failure of alpha,beta-methylene ATP to inhibit transmitter release was apparently not related to the length of pretreatment with this agent because pretreatments of 0.5 to 15 min yielded similar results. These findings indicate that the ability of alpha,beta-methylene ATP to decrease excitatory junction potentials and vasoconstriction of the caudal artery, as reported by others, is not due to a decrease in the release of transmitter. In spite of not possessing agonistic properties, alpha,beta-methylene ATP does interact with prejunctional purinoceptors as judged by the finding that the inhibitory effects of 2-chloroadenosine and beta,gamma-methylene ATP, but not those of the alpha-2 agonist clonidine, were antagonized by alpha,beta-methylene ATP. alpha,beta-Methylene ATP thus appears to be an antagonist at prejunctional purinoceptors (classified by us previously as P3-purinoceptors). alpha,beta-Methylene ATP also appears to act as an antagonist against endogenously released adenine nucleosides and nucleotides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The actions of nicorandil on ionic currents recorded from smooth muscle cells of the rat portal vein were investigated using patch-clamp technique. In the whole-cell voltage clamp experiments, nicorandil (greater than 30 microM) produced an outward current in a concentration-dependent manner. The reversal potential was -80 mV. The nicorandil-induced outward current was suppressed in the nominally Ca-free (2.5 mM Mn-containing) solution. Tetraethylammonium (greater than 1 mM) and 4-aminopyridine (greater than 1 mM) inhibited the nicorandil-induced outward current. Recordings of single K-channels showed that there were two types of K currents with different conductance (132 pS and 10 pS) in the smooth muscle cell membrane. Both channels were sensitive to intracellular Ca concentration. The 10-pS K-channel but not the 132-pS K-channel was activated by lowering the ATP concentration inside of the membrane. Low concentrations of tetraethylammonium (less than 1 mM) completely inhibited the 132-pS K-channel, but had no effect on the 10-pS K-channel. On the other hand, 4-aminopyridine (10 mM) inhibited the 10-pS K-channel but not 132-pS K-channel. Nicorandil (500 microM) applied to outside of the membrane increased the mean open-time and number of appearances but reduced slow component of the mean closed time of the 10-pS K-channel current, without affecting their amplitudes. Nicorandil (less than 500 microM) did not modify the 132-pS K-channel. From above results we concluded that nicorandil activates the Ca-dependent and ATP-sensitive K-channel in smooth muscle cells of the rat portal vein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90369544\r", 
  ".W": "Previous rat liver perfusion studies had shown a preferential derecruitment of downstream (phenacetin O-de-ethylation) in relation to upstream (acetaminophen sulfation) hepatocyte activities with reductions in prograde (normal) flow, with substrates entering from the portal vein and exiting the hepatic vein. The reduction in metabolic activities was found associated with a reduction in accessible intracellular water space (Pang et al., J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 16: 595, 1988). In the present studies, we investigated the changes in metabolic activities of the liver and its accessible spaces during retrograde flow (substrates entering from the hepatic vein and exiting the portal vein), an approach used to probe zonal heterogeneity in the liver. The multiple indicator dilution technique was used to gain information concerning the accessible sinusoidal blood volume, Disse space, and the intracellular water space; once-through perfusion with tracer [3H]acetaminophen and [14C]phenacetin was performed simultaneously within the same liver, to estimate metabolic activities at the periportal and perihepatic venous regions of the liver, respectively, at the designated flows. The estimated sinusoidal blood volume, total albumin and sucrose distribution spaces, the Disse space and the accessible albumin and sucrose Disse spaces showed weak but positive correlations with retrograde perfusate flow rate. The values were substantially greater than those for rat livers perfused with normal (prograde) flows, suggesting an increase in the vascular space and accessible Disse space of the liver during retrograde flow. The total water and accessible intracellular water spaces also showed weak but positive correlations with retrograde perfusate flow, and the average intracellular water space (which is also accessed by the substrates) at both retrograde flows of 8 and 12 ml/min was 0.52 +/- 0.08 and 0.55 +/- 0.08 ml/g liver, respectively, values that were not statistically different. When the intracellular water space was plotted vs. water flow rate (ml water/g liver), a weakly positive correlation was again found, suggesting that over the flow range, the accessible intracellular water space decreased in a very gradual and linear fashion with a reduction in water flow rate. When the estimated intracellular water space for retrograde flow was compared with values obtained for the same flow rate in a prograde fashion, slightly lower values were obtained. After consideration of the effect of the distended vascular and interstitial spaces on the weights of the liver, the values obtained for retrograde and prograde flow rates were closely similar. In both cases, it appeared that with reduction in flow, the accessible intracellular water spaces were reduced, regardless of the flow direction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Cocaine (0.05 or 0.10 mg/kg/injection) and food (1-g banana pellets) self-administration were maintained on a fixed-ratio 4 (variable ratio 16:S) schedule of reinforcement. Buprenorphine, naltrexone or an equal volume saline control solution were infused slowly over 1 hr through one lumen of a double lumen i.v. catheter at the same time each day. Saline and each dose of buprenorphine (0.237, 0.40 and 0.70 mg/kg/day) or naltrexone (0.32 and 3.20 mg/kg/day) were studied for 60 sessions over 15 consecutive days. Buprenorphine significantly suppressed cocaine self-administration (P less than .001-.0001) in comparison to saline in all monkeys. Cocaine self-administration decreased by 49 to 95% in five of six monkeys on the 1st day of buprenorphine administration (0.237 and 0.40 mg/kg/day) and remained suppressed by an average of 72 to 93% during buprenorphine treatment. After abrupt termination of buprenorphine treatment (0.237 and 0.70 mg/kg/day), cocaine self-administration remained suppressed for an average of 16 +/- 4.4 and 28 +/- 6.6 days, respectively. Buprenorphine (0.237 and 0.40 mg/kg/day) initially suppressed food self-administration in some monkeys (P less than .01), but tolerance developed to buprenorphine's effects on food-maintained responding whereas cocaine self-administration remained significantly suppressed. During treatment with 0.70 mg/kg/day of buprenorphine, food self-administration returned to or significantly exceeded (P less than .01) base-line levels in three animals. Daily patterns of food self-administration were not disrupted by buprenorphine treatment. Naltrexone (0.32 mg/kg/day) initially suppressed cocaine self-administration by an average of 28% over 15 days (P less than .0009). During high-dose naltrexone treatment (3.20 mg/kg/day), cocaine-maintained responding was suppressed by 25% over 15 days (P less than .01). Cocaine-maintained responding was not significantly changed by naltrexone in one of the five subjects. Food self-administration decreased by 24% (P less than .05) after 5 days of 0.32 mg/kg of naltrexone administration, then exceeded baseline levels during 3.20 mg/kg of naltrexone administration. These data suggest that buprenorphine decreases cocaine's reinforcing properties more effectively than naltrexone across the dose-range studied. Buprenorphine may be an effective pharmacotherapy for treatment of cocaine abuse as well as dual abuse of cocaine plus heroin.\r"

EM-523 and motilin induced contractions in the rabbit intestinal preparations but not in the rat or guinea pig preparations. In contrast, PGF2 alpha induced contractions in all three intestinal preparations. The rabbit duodenum and jejunum were more sensitive than the ileum to EM-523 and motilin, but no selectivity was observed with PGF2 alpha. The contractile responses induced by EM-523 and by motilin were not influenced by pretreatment with tetrodotoxin, atropine, naloxone or mepyramine but were greatly suppressed by pretreatment with verapamil or removal of calcium ions from the medium, suggesting that both agents induce intestinal contractions by acting directly on smooth muscle and that their actions depend largely on extracellular calcium. The contractile response to EM-523 or motilin was reduced markedly after treatment of the preparation with a high concentration of either agent, and cross-tachyphylaxis between EM-523 and motilin was also observed. These findings indicate that the contractile activity of EM-523 is very similar to that of motilin and that EM-523 and motilin may share the same site of action.\r"

Rats were prepared surgically with arterial and venous catheters and bladder cannulas. Clearance experiments and measurements of blood pressure and heart rate were carried out at least 4 days after surgery in unanesthetized animals. Intravenous administration of morphine (4 mg/kg b.wt.) caused a decrease in fractional sodium excretion, (at 90 min after injection, vehicle, 2.49 +/- 0.30% vs. morphine, 1.12 +/- 0.17%, P less than .05), in the absence of significant changes in systemic hemodynamics or glomerular filtration rate. This effect was prevented by pretreatment with naloxone. Enhanced proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium was considered as a possible explanation for the decrease in sodium excretion which followed morphine administration. Proximal tubular fluid reabsorption was estimated utilizing the lithium clearance method. Results indicated a reduction in fractional excretion of lithium by morphine administration (at 90 min, vehicle, 34.2 +/- 3.3% vs. morphine, 18.8 +/- 2.3%, P less than .05), which was also prevented by naloxone pretreatment. It is concluded that, under the present experimental conditions, morphine enhances tubular reabsorption of sodium by an opiate receptor-dependent mechanism and that this effect is, at least in part, localized in the proximal tubule.\r"

Compensatory renal growth occurred in all uninephrectomized (NPX) rats 12 days after surgery. The weights of, and the amounts of total protein in, the remnant left kidneys from the NPX rats were significantly greater than those of the corresponding left kidneys from sham-operated (SHAM) rats. The concentration of GSH in samples of whole kidney, cortex and outer stripe of the outer medulla increased after uninephrectomy, with the most striking changes occurring in the outer stripe of the outer medulla. The concentration of GSH in all samples from the SHAM and NPX rats was greater after the administration of a low, nontoxic dose of HgCl2 (0.5-mumol/kg). As with uninephrectomy alone, the increases due to inorganic Hg in both SHAM and NPX rats were greatest in the outer stripe of the outer medulla. The concentration of GSH increased further with a higher, toxic dose of HgCl2 (2.0-mumol/kg). Increasing the dose of HgCl2 to 3.0-mumol/kg resulted in more severe damage to the kidneys of all rats and in decreased concentration of renal GSH. The concentration of Hg under the same conditions as above was also measured, and closely paralleled that of GSH, with the greatest differences occurring in the outer stripe of the outer medulla. To explain these results, we hypothesize that both during compensatory renal growth and after administration of low, nontoxic to mildly toxic doses of Hg, GSH synthesis is induced. At higher, more toxic doses of Hg, GSH depletion becomes more prominent.\r"

Pretreatment with BN 50739 (3 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited PAF (500 pmol/kg i.v.)-induced thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and plasma thromboxane B2 elevation in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect lasted 3.5 to 4.5 hr. BN 50739 (10 mg/kg) prevented the early phase of LPS (50 micrograms/kg i.v.)-induced thrombocytopenia and thromboxane B2 elevation, and reduced the 24-hr mortality rate from 75 to 22% (P less than .05). Post-treatment with BN 50739 increased the 10-hr survival rate from 33 to 87% (P less than .05); however, it had no effect on the 24-hr mortality. BN 50739 did not affect LPS-induced leukopenia or the elevation in plasma tumor necrosis factor. Our data support possible therapeutic efficacy of PAF antagonists in septic shock despite their inability to prevent the generation of tumor necrosis factor.\r"

In rat aortic rings, SZL-49 (0.1-10 nM) shifted the dose-response curves for norepinephrine and phenylephrine to the right. The curves were biphasic, consisting of high and low affinity components. At greater than 10 nM, the curves became monophasic. After SZL-49 treatment, the response to norepinephrine was partially antagonized by diltiazem. Chlorethylclonidine (1-100 microM) also produced biphasic dose-response curves. Phenylephrine bound to high and low affinity sites labeled by [3H]prazosin, and the high affinity site was eliminated by SZL-49. SZL-49 (i.p.) shifted the pressor dose-response curve for phenylephrine to the right but did not decrease the maximal response. Chlorethylclonidine was much less potent than SZL-49 at shifting the pressor dose-response curve. Pertussis toxin, 50 micrograms/kg i.v., shifted the phenylephrine pressor dose-response curve in control and SZL-49-treated animals. SZL-49 inhibited norepinephrine-induced inositol phosphate formation, whereas chlorethylclonidine had no effect on inositol phosphate formation. These data show: 1) both in vitro and in vivo, alpha-1 receptor subtypes sensitive and resistant to alkylation by SZL-49 can mediate the full response of agonists; 2) these subtypes exhibit high and low affinity for agonists; 3) responses mediated by either subtype are partially dependent on calcium channel activity and a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein; 4) the SZL-49 sensitive site is able to enhance the formation of inositol phosphates.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of route of administration, state of hydration and transport inhibitor probenecid on the renal responses of a loop diuretic, piretanide, were investigated in 14 healthy volunteers. Maximally achieved plasma concentrations after i.v. and oral piretanide were higher in the nonhydrated state [+54% (i.v.); + 68% (oral)], accompanied by significant decreases in mean residence time, renal clearance and fraction of unchanged drug excreted with nonsignificant decreases in t1/2, steady-state volume of distribution and total clearance when compared with the hydrated state. Relative differences between the two hydrated states in maximal plasma concentrations of piretanide remained after probenecid [+26% (i.v.); +55% (oral)] but changes in kinetic parameters did not. Pretreatment with probenecid produced significant increases in absolute peak and plasma diuretic concentrations, t1/2 and mean residence time while decreasing steady-state volume of distribution, total clearance, renal clearance and fraction of unchanged drug excreted without affecting the bioavailability of piretanide. Urinary drug recovery was greater after i.v. than after oral piretanide, the recovery being consistently lower in nonhydrated state [iv: 2.78 (nonhydrated) versus 3.41 mg/24 h (hydrated); oral: 1.93 (nonhydrated) versus 2.76 mg/24 h (hydrated)]. Probenecid pretreatment reduced the overall urinary recovery of piretanide without altering the i.v./oral differences. Excretion of sodium paralleled piretanide excretion throughout the study except after i.v. dosing in the nonhydrated state where changes in drug excretion after probenecid (2.55 versus 1.63 mg/6 h) failed to influence sodium output (167 versus 152 mmol/6 h). These results demonstrate the importance of route of administration and state of hydration in determining the pharmacocological response of loop diuretics within the kidney.\r"

To obtain a national perspective on the role of depression in the dynamics of smoking, we analyzed data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. We used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale to assess symptoms of depression and used the standard cutoff (score, greater than or equal to 16) for defining persons as depressed. The cross-sectional analysis of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that the prevalence of current smokers increased as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score increased, whereas the quit ratio (former smokers/ever smokers) decreased as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score increased. Among the cohort of smokers in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, the estimated incidence of quitting after 9 years of follow-up was 9.9% for depressed smokers and 17.7% for nondepressed smokers. When we adjusted for amount smoked, sex, age, and educational attainment by means of a Cox proportional hazards model, we found that depressed smokers were 40% less likely to have quit compared with nondepressed smokers (relative risk, 0.6). These findings suggest that depression plays an important role in the dynamics of cigarette smoking in the United States.\r"

We conducted a test of this association, employing population-based data (n = 3213) collected between 1980 and 1983 in the St Louis Epidemiologic Catchment Area Survey of the National Institute of Mental Health. A history of regular smoking was observed more frequently among individuals who had experienced major depressive disorder at some time in their lives than among individuals who had never experienced major depression or among individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. Smokers with major depression were also less successful at their attempts to quit than were either of the comparison groups. Gender differences in rates of smoking and of smoking cessation observed in the larger population were not evident among the depressed group. Furthermore, the association between cigarette smoking and major depression was not ubiquitous across all psychiatric diagnoses. Other data are cited indicating that when individuals with a history of depression stop smoking, depressive symptoms and, in some cases, serious major depression may ensue.\r"

  ".U": "90369661\r", 
  ".W": "Cigarette smoking initiation greatly influences smoking prevalence in the United States. To understand better the initiation of cigarette smoking, we estimated the age-specific incidence of cigarette smoking initiation in relation to race/ethnicity, sex, and educational attainment, using the reported age at smoking onset for 18- to 35-year-old respondents in the 1987 National Health Interview Survey (N = 14764) and the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 3123) conducted during 1982 to 1984. Among white, black, and Hispanic respondents the incidence of smoking initiation increased rapidly after 11 years of age, reaching a peak in groups 17 to 19 years of age, rapidly declining in groups through age 25 years, and gradually declining thereafter. Age-specific smoking initiation rates were generally lower among black than white respondents, similar between white and Hispanic respondents, and appreciably higher among black and Hispanic men than women. Compared with persons who graduated from high school, persons with less than high school education were consistently more likely to start smoking cigarettes during childhood and adolescence. These data indicate that age and educational attainment are the factors most consistently associated with cigarette smoking initiation among all race/ethnic groups in the United States. These data also emphasize the need for smoking-prevention education beginning at an early age, particularly among persons of low socioeconomic status.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships among cigarette smoking, hemoglobin concentration, and carboxyhemoglobin concentration were examined using data from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Among women, smokers had a mean (+/- SE) hemoglobin level of 137 +/- 0.4 g/L, significantly higher than the mean hemoglobin level of 133 +/- 0.5 g/L for never-smokers. Among men, the mean hemoglobin levels for smokers and never-smokers were 156 +/- 0.4 and 152 +/- 0.5 g/L, respectively. No significant difference in mean hemoglobin was noted between ex-smokers and never-smokers. Mean hemoglobin levels and carboxyhemoglobin levels increased progressively with the number of cigarettes consumed per day. Cigarette smoking seems to cause a generalized upward shift of the hemoglobin distribution curve, which reduces the utility of hemoglobin level to detect anemia. Among women of comparable socioeconomic status, the prevalence of anemia was 4.8% +/- 0.6% among smokers, compared with 8.5% +/- 1.2% among never-smokers. This study suggests that minimum hemoglobin cutoff values should be adjusted for smokers to compensate for the masking effect of smoking on the detection of anemia.\r"

We found that intermittent mouth rinsing with coffee or cola, but not distilled water, substantially reduced salivary pH and nicotine absorption. Because many commonly consumed substances were also found to be highly acidic, we recommend that patients do not ingest any substance during or immediately before nicotine polacrilex use.\r"

A 25% decrease in employee smoking prevalence was found (21.7% vs 16.2% before vs after policy implementation, respectively). The daily number of cigarettes reportedly smoked by employees who continued smoking and the total number smoked at work decreased across all occupational categories by an average of 25%. Significant reductions were noted in the level of public smoking and the amount of cigarette remnants. Nicotine vapor concentrations decreased significantly in all areas except restrooms. These findings suggest that visible smoking and environmental tobacco smoke exposure can be markedly decreased by instituting a policy eliminating smoking in a large medical center.\r"

Although substantial progress has been made over the past 25 years, there is growing recognition of the need for large-scale efforts to reduce tobacco use. Given their central roles in implementing public health programs and their ability to reach many of the groups most at risk of tobacco use uptake and tobacco-related disease, state health agencies have an important challenge before them. This article describes the development and operation of a statewide, publicly funded anti-tobacco use campaign currently undertaken by the California Department of Health Services under the auspices of the state's Tobacco Tax and Health Promotion Act of 1988 (Proposition 99), which increased excise taxes on cigarettes by 25 cents per pack sold in the state. A discussion of problems in implementation and operation being incurred may be relevant to the planning of similar campaigns elsewhere.\r"

  ".W": "Half of the global increase in tobacco use from 1976 to 1986 occurred in the People's Republic of China. In 1984, the first national smoking survey was conducted in China, involving over a half-million subjects. Sixty-one percent of Chinese males over age 15 smoke, with higher rates in all occupational groups than for corresponding groups in the United States. Current smoking patterns in China are similar to those in the United States during the 1950s, and these patterns forecast a steadily increasing epidemic of smoking-related deaths. It is estimated that by 2025, two million Chinese men will die annually from smoking. Foreign tobacco companies are mounting massive production and advertising campaigns in China. Government health education programs lack funds to counter these influences with sustained and comprehensive educational and interventional campaigns. To avert an impending national health catastrophe, China must launch a comprehensive smoking-control initiative aimed at public education, cessation, and legislation and policy.\r"

To evaluate the long-term results of this method of laterofixation, 11 consecutive patients were examined at least 5 years postoperatively regarding breathing capacity, voice function, and swallowing ability. Breathing capacity was assessed by determination of orolaryngeal (upper) airway resistance and spirometry. Voice function was judged by two listening panels. Swallowing ability was studied by barium contrast radiography. Postoperative improvement of breathing capacity was, in most cases, found to be long lasting. Furthermore, there was no deterioration of voice function, nor were there aspiration problems during the postoperative follow-up period. We suggest this method of laterofixation as the treatment of choice in patients suffering from breathing difficulties due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis.\r"

Regenerated potentials were recorded from both the involved thyroarytenoid and posterior cricoarytenoid muscles for an average of 5 to 6 weeks postoperatively. 2. Average onset of recovery of spontaneous adduction was 10 weeks following surgery, and four dogs regained complete recovery of adduction in 13 to 14 weeks. Average onset of recovery of spontaneous abduction was 11.8 weeks postoperatively, and none of the four dogs displayed complete recovery. 3. The time delay between the onset of regenerated potentials and onset of recovery of cord mobility averaged 4.2 weeks for adduction and 6.4 weeks for abduction. 4. Incomplete recovery of movements of the reinnervated vocal cord might be due to an inadequate number of effective motor units. 5. End-to-end anastomosis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve can be performed as one method of reinnervating the denervated intrinsic laryngeal muscles, and further histological studies should be carried out to determine if the regenerated nerve fibers actually have decreased.\r"

  ".W": "The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic has introduced an increasing population of immune-compromised patients susceptible to infections by unusual pathogens. To evaluate the role of traditional antibiotic therapy for deep neck infections in high-risk patients, we reviewed the records of 73 patients with deep neck infections. Forty-six had or were at risk for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and nine were diabetics. Staphylococcal infections were more common in the at-risk group, and 24% of staphylococcal isolates in intravenous drug abusers were methicillin-sodium resistant. In addition, Klebsiella was isolated in two of nine diabetic patients. No other clinical differences were noted, and no unusual organisms were isolated from any other patients. Although traditional antibiotic therapy is appropriate for deep neck infections in patients at risk for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, vancomycin hydrochloride should be considered when staphylococcal infections are suspected in intravenous drug abusers. Since diabetics appear to be susceptible to infections by gram-negative rods, broader antibiotic coverage must be considered in this population.\r"

A dramatic increase has been seen in confirmed cases of NTM lymphadenitis in San Diego in the past few years. This report encompasses a span of 2 years 9 months, during which 22 children had confirmed NTM infection and another 14 had necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis in whom the specific diagnosis of NTM could not be made. This apparent increase in the prevalence of NTM as compared to previous reports in the literature suggests a possible endemic risk for NTM in the San Diego area. These cases are reviewed and our diagnostic and surgical approach to possible NTM infection is described. We also discuss possible explanations for the increasing occurrence of NTM in the San Diego area.\r"

The etiology is related to the rupture of terminal alveoli and dissection of air along the pulmonary vasculature. Exercise may contribute to the process by increases in intrathoracic pressure. Six cases of spontaneous cervical emphysema, all related to SCUBA diving training at a Naval facility, were recently seen at our institution. Proper management entails having a high index of suspicion for diagnosis, and then being able to identify potentially life-threatening complications.\r"

Eight guinea pigs and four mice underwent immunizations with a preparation of chick or guinea pig cochlear tissue and Freund's adjuvant. Hearing thresholds were monitored by auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing over a 5-week period after immunization. The serum and temporal bones of test and control animals were then examined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunocytochemical, and histological techniques. Hearing loss of 20 dB or greater occurred in eight animals. ELISA demonstrated antibodies to cochlear antigens in the sera of all test animals. Immunocytochemistry revealed immunostaining of hair cell stereocilia in the organ of Corti and saccule. Endolymphatic hydrops, and organ of Corti degeneration was observed in the temporal bones of three animals. This study provides evidence to suggest that cross-species immunization with cochlear antigens might produce a humoral response that can be associated with inner ear pathologic change and sensorineural hearing loss.\r"

A middle fossa decompression of the internal auditory canal (IAC) was performed in 8 patients (5 with NF-2 tumors and 3 with neuromas in an only-hearing ear). In 5 of the 8, the speech discrimination scores at the 6-month follow-up were better than preoperative scores. After 6 months, however, hearing regressed at variable rates. Although not a definitive therapeutic treatment, decompression of the IAC appears to improve and perhaps prolong useful hearing, which gains valuable time for rehabilitation. Rigid follow-up by computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging is essential.\r"

We question whether wound healing and subsequent quality of voice would be better if the surgeon used the \"cold technique\" with microlaryngeal instruments. Since the advent, in 1987, of a small-spot (0.3 mm) CO2 laser micromanipulator and more precise microlaryngeal instruments, we have redefined our use of the CO2 laser for benign laryngeal lesions. Over the past 4 years, in a series of 68 consecutive patients with vocal cord nodules, polyps, polypoid changes, or granulomas, the CO2 laser was useful for mucosal micro-flap dissection techniques and for vascular lesions. Smaller pedunculated lesions, such as vocal cord nodules, were more efficiently removed with the new microlaryngeal instrumentation. The combined selective use of a microspot CO2 laser at low-power settings (1 to 3 W), with 0.1-second pulses, and with precise microlaryngeal instruments will give the best results.\r"

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the early complications of airway management which occur in head-injured patients and to determine if these are different from what has been reported in patients with chronic illnesses (i.e., diabetes, atherosclerosis, or immunosuppression). Chart review of 52 head-injured patients reveals an early complication rate of 61% for endotracheal intubation and 20% for tracheotomy. Discriminant analysis shows that increasing duration of intubation is the most significant factor in predicting airway management complications (P less than 0.008). The incidence of complications seen in head-injured patients is similar to that of the chronically ill. Complications of endotracheal intubation are judged to be more severe than those of tracheotomy. Data from this study supports the early tracheotomy of severely head-injured patients who are likely to require prolonged airway management.\r"

Since our initial report of this entity in 1981, several cases have been photo-documented. Study of whole organ sections of an involved larynx have demonstrated the histopathology. Diabetic renal transplant patients appear to be particularly susceptible to the condition, due to prolonged gastroparesis and requirement for nasogastric tube drainage.

The 10-year actuarial value for local control was 48%; for regional control, it was 66%. Distant failure occurred in 20 patients. The 10-year actuarially corrected survival rate was 40% (stage I, 57%; stage II, 51%; stage III, 43%; stage VI, 21%). Locoregional tumor control was significantly influenced by irradiation parameters (total dose and treatment time), tumor volume, sex, and hemoglobin value. It is concluded that local control of the tumor while still in the T position is the parameter most crucial to success. This end point is currently being aimed at evaluating primary surgery and testing a radiation technique with larger total doses and shrinking fields and a new radiosensitizer, while at the same time investigating the influence of hemoglobin concentration.\r"

  ".U": "90370053\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Hirsutism in women is a clinical manifestation of excessive production of androgens. The source of the excess androgen may be either the ovaries or the adrenal glands, and distinguishing between these sources may be difficult. METHODS. To determine whether measurements of plasma dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate and ACTH stimulation tests, both widely used in the evaluation of hirsutism in women, provide useful information, we performed both tests in 22 normal women and 31 female patients with hirsutism. The hormones measured in plasma during the ACTH stimulation tests were progesterone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, DHEA, androstenedione, 11-deoxycortisol, and cortisol. RESULTS. The women with hirsutism were divided into four groups based on their individual responses to ACTH stimulation: patients with a possible 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency, those with a possible 21-hydroxylase deficiency, those with a possible 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency, and those with no apparent defect in steroidogenesis. The results in 19 patients (61 percent) suggested subtle defects in adrenal steroidogenesis. There was no significant correlation between the basal plasma DHEA sulfate levels and the hormonal response to ACTH, nor were the basal levels of hormones predictive of the levels after ACTH stimulation. Eleven patients had significantly elevated basal levels of plasma DHEA sulfate; only 5 of these 11 had responses to ACTH suggestive of compromised steroidogenesis. Thirteen patients who had responses suggestive of defective steroidogenesis had DHEA sulfate levels within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS. A substantial proportion of women with hirsutism have mild defects in adrenal steroidogenesis, revealed by an ACTH stimulation test, that are indicative of late-onset (nonclassic) congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Measurements of basal steroid levels are not helpful in differentiating among the causes of increased androgen production in such patients and may be misleading.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Late-onset (non-classic) congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a cause of hirsutism, menstrual disorders, and infertility, but its frequency and the patterns of abnormalities in adrenal hormone secretion are not well understood. We investigated the frequency and ethnic distribution of nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to deficiencies of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, or 11 beta-hydroxylase among 170 Israeli Jewish women with these clinical problems. All enzyme defects were identified by comparing the patients' hormonal responses to a 0.25-mg intravenous bolus dose of alpha 1-24-ACTH with those of 26 age-matched normal women. RESULTS. Twenty women (12 percent) had 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency, 18 (10 percent) 21-hydroxylase deficiency (14 homozygous), and 14 (8 percent) 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency. All the homozygous women with 21-hydroxylase deficiency also had evidence of a partial deficiency in 11 beta-hydroxylase activity. Similarly, most of the women with 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency also had evidence of a deficiency in 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase. Among the 118 women with no adrenal biosynthetic defect, 38 had high plasma androgen concentrations, and 80 had normal concentrations. CONCLUSIONS. About one third of Israeli Jewish women with hirsutism, menstrual disorders, or unexplained infertility had nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Secondary adrenal biosynthetic defects were frequent in these women and were probably caused by intra-adrenal androgen excess rather than by dual inherited enzymatic deficiencies.\r"

The two structures are very similar. The actin molecule consists of two domains which can be further subdivided into two subdomains. ADP or ATP is located in the cleft between the domains with a calcium ion bound to the beta- or beta- and gamma-phosphates, respectively. The motif of a five-stranded beta sheet consisting of a beta meander and a right handed beta alpha beta unit appears in each domain suggesting that gene duplication might have occurred. These sheets have the same topology as that found in hexokinase.\r"

  ".W": "The diverse physiological actions of dopamine are mediated by its interaction with two basic types of G protein-coupled receptor, D1 and D2, which stimulate and inhibit, respectively, the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Alterations in the number or activity of these receptors may be a contributory factor in diseases such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of the gene encoding a human D1 dopamine receptor. The coding region of this gene is intronless, unlike the gene encoding the D2 dopamine receptor. The D1 receptor gene encodes a protein of 446 amino acids having a predicted relative molecular mass of 49,300 and a transmembrane topology similar to that of other G protein-coupled receptors. Transient or stable expression of the cloned gene in host cells established specific ligand binding and functional activity characteristic of a D1 dopamine receptor coupled to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization revealed that the messenger RNA for this receptor is most abundant in caudate, nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle, with little or no mRNA detectable in substantia nigra, liver, kidney, or heart. Several observations from this work in conjunction with results from other studies are consistent with the idea that other D1 dopamine receptor subtypes may exist.\r"

On the basis of their biochemical and pharmacological characteristics, dopamine receptors are classified into D1 and D2 subtypes. As the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, D1 receptors seem to mediate some behavioural responses, modulate activity of D2 dopamine receptors, and regulate neuron growth and differentiation. The D dopamine receptor has been cloned by low-stringency screening. We report here the cloning of human and rat D1 dopamine receptors by applying an approach based on the polymerase chain reaction. The cloned human D1 dopamine receptor has been characterized on the basis of four criteria: the deduced amino-acid sequence, which reveals that it is a G protein-coupled receptor; the tissue distribution of its messenger RNA, which is compatible with that of the D1 dopamine receptor; its pharmacological profile when transfected into COS-7 cells; and its ability to stimulate the accumulation of cyclic AMP in human 293 cells.\r"

  ".U": "90370096\r", 
  ".W": "Numerous inherited retinal degenerations exist in animals and humans, in which photoreceptors inexplicably degenerate and disappear. In RCS rats with inherited retinal dystrophy, the mutant gene is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell, and leads to the loss of photoreceptor cells. Photoreceptors can be rescued from degeneration if they are juxtaposed to wild-type RPE cells in experimental chimaeras or by the transplantation of RPE cells from normal rats. In both cases, the rescue effect extends beyond the immediate boundaries of the normal RPE cells, suggesting trophic action of a diffusible factor(s) from the normal RPE cells. We considered that the fibroblast growth factors, aFGF and bFGF, might have such a trophic role as they are found in the retina and RPE cells; bFGF acts as a neurotrophic agent after axonal injury in several regions of the central nervous system, and bFGF induces retinal regeneration from developing RPE cells. Here we report that subretinal injection of bFGF results in extensive rescue of photoreceptors in RCS rats for at least two months after the injection, and that intravitreal injection of bFGF results in even more widespread rescue, across almost the entire retina. The findings demonstrate for the first time that bFGF can act as a survival-promoting neurotrophic factor in a hereditary neuronal degeneration of the central nervous system.\r"

It may, therefore, be of therapeutic value to target an antiviral agent to CD4+ cells to prevent infection and to inhibit HIV-1 production in patients' CD4+ cells which contain proviral DNA. We report here that HIV-1 replication in normal primary CD4+ T cells can be inhibited by pokeweed antiviral protein, a plant protein of relative molecular mass 30,000, which inhibits replication of certain plant RNA viruses, and of herpes simplex virus, poliovirus and influenza virus. Targeting pokeweed antiviral protein to CD4+ T cells by conjugating it to monoclonal antibodies reactive with CD5, CD7 or CD4 expressed on CD4+ cells, increased its anti-HIV potency up to 1,000-fold. HIV-1 replication is inhibited at picomolar concentrations of conjugates of pokeweed antiviral protein and monoclonal antibodies, which do not inhibit proliferation of normal CD4+ T cells or CD4-dependent responses. These conjugates inhibit HIV-1 protein synthesis and also strongly inhibit HIV-1 production in activated CD4+ T cells from infected patients.\r"

The bound adenine nucleotide stabilizes the protein against denaturation and the ATPase activity, although not required for actin polymerization, affects the kinetics of this assembly Here we provide evidence for another effect of adenine nucleotides. We find that actin filaments made from ATP-containing monomers, the ATPase activity of which hydrolyses ATP to ADP following polymerization, are stiff rods, whereas filaments prepared from ADP-monomers are flexible. ATP exchanges with ADP in such filaments and stiffens them. Because both kinds of actin filaments contain mainly ADP, we suggest the alignment of actin monomers in filaments that have bound and hydrolysed ATP traps them conformationally and stores elastic energy. This energy would be available for release by actin-binding proteins that transduce force or sever actin filaments. These data support earlier proposals that actin is not merely a passive cable, but has an active mechanochemical role in cell function.\r"

Sequence alignment based on the crystal structure. On the cleaved form of the archetypal serpin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, indicates that the serpins share a common highly ordered structure. On cleavage of the reactive centre peptide bond, they characteristically undergo a remarkable conformational change, the newly generated C terminus moving some 70 A to the opposite pole of the molecule. The structure of this post-cleavage form is known, but the conformation of the intact serpins and in particular that of their reactive centre is not. Wright et al.'s structure of plakalbumin (ovalbumin cleaved by subtilisin) has provided evidence for the conformational change that results from cleavage. We have now determined the structure of native ovalbumin to 1.95 A resolution and have found that the intact peptide loop forming the analogue to the reactive centre of the inhibitory serpins takes the unexpected form of a protruding, isolated helix. This model of the intact structures of the serpins suggests how they may interact with their target proteases.\r"

  ".W": "The neurons of layer 4 in the adult cerebral cortex receive their major ascending inputs from the thalamus. In development, however, thalamic axons arrive at the appropriate cortical area long before their target layer 4 neurons have migrated into the cortical plate. The axons accumulate and wait in the zone below the cortical plate, the subplate, for several weeks before invading the cortical plate. The subplate is a transient zone that contains the first postmitotic neurons of the telencephalon. These neurons mature well before other cortical neurons, and disappear by cell death after the thalamic axons have grown into the overlying cortical plate. The close proximity of growing thalamocortical axons and subplate neurons suggests that they might be involved in interactions important for normal thalamocortical development. Here we show that early in development the deletion of subplate neurons located beneath visual cortex prevents axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus from recognizing and innervating visual cortex, their normal target. In the absence of subplate neurons, lateral geniculate nucleus axons continue to grow in the white matter past visual cortex despite the presence of their target layer 4 neurons. Thus the transient subplate neurons are necessary for appropriate cortical target selection by thalamocortical axons.\r"

Considerable biochemical evidence now indicates that this process could be mediated by a G protein-coupled cascade using cyclic AMP as an intracellular second messenger. A stimulatory G protein alpha subunit is expressed at high levels in olfactory neurons and is specifically enriched in the cilia, as is a novel form of adenylyl cyclase. This implies that the olfactory transduction cascade might involve unique molecular components. Electrophysiological studies have identified a cyclic nucleotide-activated ion channel in olfactory cilia. These observations provide evidence for a model in which odorants increase intracellular cAMP concentration, which in turn activates this channel and depolarizes the sensory neuron. An analogous cascade regulating a cGMP-gated channel mediates visual transduction in photoreceptor cells. The formal similarities between olfactory and visual transduction suggest that the two systems might use homologous channels. Here we report the molecular cloning, functional expression and characterization of a channel that is likely to mediate olfactory transduction.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term reconstitution of the lymphohaematopoietic cells of a mouse after lethal irradiation requires the transplantation of at least (5-10) x 10(3) bone marrow cells. Several cell-separation techniques based on cell-surface characteristics have been used in attempts to identify the pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells (PHSC), and have allowed the long-term engraftment of lethally irradiated mice with an enriched fraction of fewer than 200 marrow cells. But these techniques enrich not only for PHSC but also for haematopoietic progenitors, especially day-12 spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S). Although day-12 CFU-S have been postulated to be primitive multipotential haematopoietic progenitors, with day-8 CFU-S representing later, more committed progenitors, recent evidence suggests that neither of these CFU-S represents mouse PHSC. Here we report that counterflow centrifugal elutriation, which sorts cells on the basis of size and density, can separate PHSC from these less primitive progenitors. The fraction containing the largest cells was enriched for the granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), but gave only transient, early engraftment and was therefore depleted of PHSC. The intermediate fraction was enriched for CFU-S, but depleted of CFU-GM. Despite being devoid of CFU-GM and CFU-S, the fraction consisting of only morphological lymphocytes gave sustained, albeit delayed, reconstitution of all lymphohaematopoietic cells, and was therefore enriched for PHSC. We conclude that there are two vital classes of engrafting cells: committed progenitors, which provide initial, unsustained engraftment, and PHSC, which produce delayed, but durable, engraftment. Therefore for late haematological reconstitution, PHSC must be transplanted with a distinguishable source of early engrafting cells, thereby allowing the lethally irradiated host to survive initial aplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Alzheimer's disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder of unknown aetiology, is usually considered to be a single disorder because of the general uniformity of the disease phenotype. Two recent genetic linkage studies revealed co-segregation of familial Alzheimer disease with the D21S1/S11 and D21S16 loci on chromosome 21. But two other studies, one of predominantly multiplex kindreds with a late age-of-onset, the other of a cadre of kindreds with a unique Volga German ethnic origin, found absence of linkage at least to D21S1/S11. So far it has not been possible to discern whether these conflicting reports reflect aetiological heterogeneity, differences in methods of pedigree selection, effects of confounding variables in the analysis (for example, diagnostic errors, assortative matings), or true non-replication. To resolve this issue, we have now examined the inheritance of five polymorphic DNA markers from the proximal long arm of chromosome 21 in a large unselected series of pedigrees with familial Alzheimer's disease. Our data suggest that Alzheimer's disease is not a single entity, but rather results from genetic defects on chromosome 21 and from other genetic or nongenetic factors.\r"

  ".W": "The sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, MyoD, can activate muscle-specific gene expression in some cells in culture. Xenopus MyoD (XMyoD) transcription is activated as a consequence of mesoderm induction in the early myotomes, from which the axial musculature develops. XMyoD RNA accumulates about two hours before muscle-specific actin transcripts first appear, and so is expressed at the right time and in the right place to play a part in activating muscle-specific gene expression in normal development. To test this idea, we have expressed XMyoD ectopically in early Xenopus embryos. We find that injection of XMyoD RNA can strongly activate muscle genes in embryo cells normally destined to form ectoderm. Nevertheless, these cells fail to differentiate as muscle, suggesting that additional factors are required for complete and stable myogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The determination of receptor-ligand dissociation constants from displacement data has been restricted until recently to the condition of receptor saturation, in which the concentration of receptor is negligible as compared to the displaced ligand and the displacing ligand used. This restriction has lately been removed since an accurate method has been developed for the determination of the dissociation constants for all experimental conditions for a system that includes a single type of binding site. In many cases, however, there are two types of receptor binding sites that exhibit different affinities toward the ligand. The present study provides an analytic solution for the problem of determination of the two dissociation constants as well as the proportion of the two receptor types. The formal derivation of the equations is described, along with analysis of a displacement simulation. The sensitivity of the method to the ratio between the two dissociation constants is also investigated. The application of the method is demonstrated for the analysis of the binding of beta-adrenergic receptors to the agonist isoproterenol as monitored by the displacement of the beta-antagonist 125I-labeled cyanopindolol.\r"

In this study, we demonstrate that interleukin 1 (IL-1) is an inhibitor of endothelial growth in vitro and in vivo. IL-1 arrested growing, cultured endothelial cells in G1 phase; inhibition of proliferation was dose dependent and occurred in parallel with occupancy of endothelial surface IL-1 receptors. In an angiogenesis model, IL-1 could inhibit fibroblast growth factor-induced vessel formation. The autocrine nature of the IL-1 effect on endothelial proliferation was demonstrated by the observation that occupancy of cell-surface receptors by endogenous IL-1 depressed cell growth. The potential significance of this finding was emphasized by the detection of IL-1 in the native endothelium of human umbilical veins. A mechanism by which IL-1 may exert its inhibitory effect on endothelial cell growth was suggested by studies showing that IL-1 decreased the expression of high-affinity fibroblast growth factor binding sites on endothelium. These results point to a potentially important role of IL-1 in regulating blood vessel growth and suggest that autocrine production of inhibitory factors may be a mechanism controlling proliferation of normal cells.\r"

  ".W": "The extracellular glycoprotein cytotactin is expressed in a characteristic and complex spatiotemporal sequence during development of the chicken embryo. To identify the various control elements underlying its expression, the promoter region of the cytotactin gene has been isolated and characterized. Clones were isolated from genomic libraries by using a fragment near the 5' end of the cDNA sequence. The sequence of this cDNA fragment was found to be distributed over two exons separated by a large first intron. The site of transcription initiation was determined by S1 nuclease and primer-extension mapping. Sequencing of a 4.3-kilobase (kb) genomic DNA clone that contains 3986 base pairs (bp) upstream of the RNA start site, the first exon, and part of the first intron revealed a number of sequence motifs implicated in the regulation and expression of eukaryotic genes. These included CCAAT boxes, phorbol ester-responsive elements, enhancer elements, and a consensus TATA sequence located 24 bp upstream of the major RNA cap site. The flanking sequence also contained a number of regions of dyad symmetry and direct repeats unique to cytotactin, as well as an array of A + T-rich sequences that resemble engrailed elements. Constructs containing fragments of the upstream region of the cytotactin gene fused to a promoterless gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase were transiently transfected into chicken embryo fibroblasts to define functional promoter sequences. Although sequences from -721 to +121 exhibited minimal promoter activity, the entire region between -3986 to +374 was required to yield maximal expression in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Transfection of the -3986/+374 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid into the human U251MG astrocytoma cells but not HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells resulted in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression, consistent with the observed synthesis of cytotactin protein only by the U251MG cell line. These data indicate that the chicken cytotactin promoter can control expression in a cell type-specific fashion within cells of another species. These studies provide a basis for the dissection of cis elements and trans factors that govern the developmental expression of the cytotactin gene.\r"

We used epifluorescence microscopy to examine the binding, internalization, and intracellular destination of [1-(2-mercapto)propionic acid,8-lysine-N6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine] vasopressin (R-MLVP) and [1-(2-mercapto)propionic acid,8-lysine-N6-carboxyfluorescein]vasopressin (F-MLVP) in these cells. The rhodamine-labeled fluorescent vasopressin analog, R-MLVP, initially bound in a diffuse manner at the cell surface of both A10 and LLC-PK1 cells and could be displaced by excess unlabeled [8-arginine]vasopressin. After incubation at 37 degrees C, bound ligand rapidly aggregated into small clusters or patches, which were internalized in a manner consistent with receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequent processing of internalized ligand-receptor complexes appeared to differ between A10 and LLC-PK1 cells. In the case of LLC-PK1 cells, ligand was delivered to a tightly focused lysosome compartment in the perinuclear region of the cell, and receptor molecules were replenished at the cell surface. The lysosomal location of ligand was supported by the quenching of fluorescence in the internalized vesicles when F-MLVP was used as a fluorescent tracer. In the case of A10 cells, ligand became localized to a vesicular compartment and reappearance of receptor at the cell surface was limited. Our data are consistent with the occurrence of receptor-mediated endocytosis of vasopressin in cells with V1 and V2 receptors.\r"

Color vision defects are caused by deletions and fusions involving these genes. However, we found the frequency of molecular abnormalities among Caucasians to be twice as high as that of phenotypic color vision defects. Among Japanese the frequency of phenotypic and molecular color vision defects was similar (approximately 5%). Among Afro-Americans, molecular defects (largely green-red fusion genes) were at least five times more frequent (21%) than phenotypic color vision defects (approximately 4%). In addition, 35% of Afro-Americans, 2% of Japanese, and less than 1% of Caucasians had a shortened red pigment gene not associated with phenotypic color vision defects. This gene lacked 1.9 kilobases in its first intron and had the identical size as the green pigment gene from which it presumably originated by gene conversion in an ancestral African population. This gene and the closely linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase A+ variant were in linkage equilibrium. A model for the evolutionary origin of the color vision pigment genes in higher primates is portrayed.\r"

In cultures of pelleted rabbit growth-plate chondrocytes, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) increased the contents of DNA and macromolecules containing uronic acid (proteoglycans). It also decreased ALPase activity with an ED50 of less than 1 nM. Other vitamin D3 metabolites, such as 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, had little effect on these biochemical parameters. In rachitic growth plates, the uronic acid content was half that in normal growth plates, whereas ALPase activity was 2.5 times that in normal growth plates. Administration of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol at a low dose (0.1 micrograms per kg of body weight) to rachitic rats increased the uronic acid content 1.4-fold and decreased ALPase activity by 40%. This compound, like 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (10 micrograms per kg of body weight), increased the calcium level of the blood. However, administration of 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol had little effect on the uronic acid and ALPase contents in growth plates. These observations suggest that 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is a bioactive form of vitamin D that plays an important role in the control of chondrocyte terminal differentiation.\r"

Human leukocyte interferon (interferon-alpha) rapidly increases the binding of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate to intact HeLa cells (ED50 = 100 units/ml), a measure of protein kinase C activation, and induces the selective translocation of the beta isoform of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the particulate fraction of HeLa cells. The subcellular distribution of the alpha and epsilon isoforms is unaffected by interferon-alpha treatment. Activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters mimics the inhibitory action of interferon-alpha on HeLa cell proliferation and down-regulation of protein kinase C blocks the induction of antiviral activity by interferon-alpha in HeLa cells. Increased phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis and phosphorylcholine production is accompanied by diacylglycerol production in response to interferon. However, inositol phospholipid turnover and free intracellular calcium concentration are unaffected. These results suggest that the transient increase in diacylglycerol, resulting from phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, may selectively activate the beta isoform of protein kinase C. Moreover, the activation of protein kinase C is a necessary element in interferon action on cells.\r"

During this reaction, much of its DNA re-acquires sensitivity to hydrolysis by DNase I in a way characteristic of the normal fibroblast. Exposed DNA forms a rim about the nucleus in both the normal and reverse-transformed cell but not in the malignant CHO-K1. Reacquisition of the nuclear rim requires an organized cytoskeleton. Sequestered DNA forms families of different degrees of sequestration. In accordance with previous theoretical developments it is proposed that (i) genes specific to a given differentiation state are stored in the nuclear rim, whereas genes specific to other states are sequestered within the nucleus; (ii) only exposed genes are active, and their activity is modulated by regulatory molecules in the fluid medium; (iii) exposure and sequestration are regulated by cytoskeletal and nuclear protein structures; (iv) in at least several types of cancer the regulatory defect lies in the genome exposure process so that the specific DNA sequences and their associated growth regulatory loci have been transferred from the exposed to the sequestered condition with consequent loss of the nuclear rim of exposed DNA. The methodology described should be generally applicable to examining the accessibility state of subsets of DNA during various physiological modulations of cell function.\r"

A number of truncated recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) molecules have been produced and shown to easily neutralize infection of laboratory strains of HIV-1 in vitro, and clinical trials using these sCD4 preparations have begun in patients with AIDS. Infectious HIV-1 titers in the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of five patients receiving sCD4 at 30 mg/day were sequentially monitored. No significant decrease in viral titers was found during therapy. Furthermore, plasma samples from eight patients with AIDS were titrated for HIV-1 with and without the addition of sCD4 ex vivo. Despite the addition of sCD4 at up to 1 mg/ml, there was little change in plasma viral titers. Subsequently, 10 primary HIV-1 isolates were tested for their susceptibility to neutralization in vitro by one preparation of sCD4. Neutralization of these clinical isolates required 200-2700 times more sCD4 than was needed to inhibit laboratory strains of HIV-1. Similar results were observed using one other monomeric sCD4 preparation and two multimeric CD4-immunoglobulin hybrid molecules. We conclude that unlike laboratory strains, primary HIV-1 isolates require high concentrations of sCD4 for neutralization. This phenomenon may pose a formidable problem for sCD4-based therapeutics in the treatment of HIV-1 infection.\r"

When the cDNA was expressed in a human oligodendroglioma cell line, ONS-21, the IL-2R beta bound IL-2 with an affinity similar to that in lymphoid cells (Kd, approximately 2 nM). Furthermore, cell proliferation ([3H]thymidine incorporation) was stimulated by IL-2. These results demonstrate that the same cytokine receptor is functional in cells of the immune system and CNS and point to a molecular mechanism that is similar for growth-signal transduction between lymphoid and neural cells but that may be different in other cells, such as fibroblasts.\r"

Three of these proteins were also found in yolk sac cells, which also express the transgene. A limited transgenic construct is not active in the choroid plexus and a TTR-producing choroid plexus tumor lacks three of the liver-enriched DNA-binding proteins.

When the pattern of gene expression is altered after injection of either 20-hydroxyecdysone or actinomycin D, the muscles persist. cDNA clones have been isolated for four genes that become abundantly expressed coincident with the commitment to degenerate. The data presented here indicate that programmed cell death is not due to the cessation of macromolecular synthesis in condemned cells but rather is due to the activation of a differentiative pathway.\r"

HBeAg-expressing transgenic mice were tolerant to both HBeAg and the nonsecreted nucleocapsid (hepatitis B cor antigen/HBcAg) at the T-cell level. Transgenic mice did not produce antibody to HBeAg but did produce anti-HBc antibody in vivo and in vitro. The coexistence of tolerance to HBc/HBe T-cell determinants and anti-HBc antibody production in vivo parallels the immunologic status of neonates born to carrier mothers. It was also demonstrated that the maintenance of T-cell tolerance to HBcAg/HBeAg required the continued presence of the tolerogen and in its absence persisted for less than 16 weeks. The reversibility of T-cell tolerance to HBcAg/HBeAg may explain the inverse correlation between age of infection and rates of viral persistence. These observations suggest that a function of the HBeAg may be to induce immunologic tolerance in utero. Expression of HBeAg may represent a viral strategy to guarantee persistence after perinatal infection.\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that C3H/HeJ transgenic (TG) mice that express a laboratory-engineered class I molecule, Q10/L, exclusively on liver parenchymal cells show no evidence of hepatic disease even after deliberate immunization. Nevertheless, these animals demonstrate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity specific for Q10/L, although it is less than that obtained from non-TG littermates. We now show that this decrease in CTL activity is not a reflection of a decrease in precursors, since both TG and normal animals have similar numbers. When non-TG C3H mice are primed with H-2Ld and H-2Kbm1 antigens, which extensively crossreact with Q10/L, their specific in vitro CTL activity directed against H-2Ld, H-2Kbm1, and Q10/L is increased 10- to 20-fold, as expected. Although primed TG mice show similar increases in in vitro CTL activity directed against H-2Ld and H-2Kbm1, they display no increase in anti-Q10/L activity. Whereas anti-H-2Ld spleen cells from non-TG mice readily generate CTL lines and clones specific for H-2Ld and Q10/L, TG cells give rise to anti-H-2Ld lines or clones only. These data indicate that the tolerance in TG mice is accounted for by the inactivation or deletion of an important CTL subpopulation having the capability of recognizing the peripheral antigen in situ. To determine whether tolerance would persist in the absence of Q10/L, TG cells were transferred into non-TG recipients. Three weeks later Q10/L-specific lytic activity generated in in vitro bulk cultures remained reduced compared to non-TG cells, indicating that the tolerant phenotype was stable during this interval.\r"

Human thrombospondin inhibited neovascularization in vivo and endothelial cell migration in vitro, as does the hamster protein, gp140. gp140 sensitized smooth muscle cells to stimulation by epidermal growth factor, as does human thrombospondin. The thrombospondin gene has been localized on human chromosome 15. These results demonstrate a function for the ubiquitous adhesive glycoprotein thrombospondin that is likely to be important in the normal physiological down-regulation of neovascularization. In addition, they raise the possibility that thrombospondin may be one of a number of target molecules through which a tumor suppressor gene could act to restrain tumor growth.\r"

The latter probes were obtained by amplification through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers directed to human specific subsequences of the interspersed repetitive sequences Alu and L1. Previously unidentified chromosomal material within hybrid lines was characterized with speed and precision. It is demonstrated that the complete human complement of hybrid lines can be rapidly assessed by comparing the data obtained with the Alu-PCR products with the results from the L1-PCR products or from the genomic hybrid DNA. This approach using interspersed repetitive sequence-PCR products is simple and fast and also provides an alternative way of generating complex DNA probe sets for the specific delineation of entire chromosomes or subchromosomal regions by in situ hybridization.\r"

  ".U": "90370844\r", 
  ".W": "To develop a general approach to designing cofactor-binding sites for catalytic antibodies, we characterized structural patterns in the binding sites of antibodies and zinc enzymes. Superposition of eight sets of antibody light- and heavy-chain variable domains identified structurally conserved sites within the sequence-variable complementarity determining regions. The pattern for catalytic zinc sites included two ligands close in sequence, a sequence-distant ligand, and a main-chain hydrogen bond joining two ligands. In both the light- and heavy-chain variable domains, the stereochemistry of five structurally conserved sites general to all known antibody structures matched that of the zinc ligands of carbonic anhydrase: three residues on two hydrogen-bonded antiparallel beta-strands. For one such general site, an antibody model replacing residue 34 on the first complementarity determining region of the light chain (L1) and residues 89 and 91 on the third complementarity determining region of the light chain (L3) with histidine ligands formed a zinc-binding site with an open coordination position at the bottom of the antibody binding pocket. For the anti-fluorescein antibody 4-4-20, this L1-L3 site placed the zinc ion about 4 A from the bound fluorescein, an indicator for metal binding. This predicted zinc-binding mutant was created in the single-chain variable domain construct, expressed, and found by fluorescence quenching to bind metal ion with an affinity constant of 10(6) M-1. Thus, our template-based multisite design proved successful for remodeling an antibody to contain a cofactor-binding site, without requiring further mutagenesis and screening. Combination of a specific light or heavy chain containing a catalytic metal site with a library of complementary chains raised to potential substrates or transition state analogs should greatly improve the production of catalytic antibodies with desired activities and specificities.\r"

Likewise, the small subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon appears to be distinct from the large subunit of the same polymerase and from the smaller subunits of DNA polymerase alpha. HeLa DNA polymerase delta is processive only when HeLa proliferating cell nuclear antigen is present, whereas DNA polymerase epsilon is quite processive in its absence. Inhibitor and activator spectra of DNA polymerases alpha, delta, and epsilon also distinguish the three enzymes. These results and immunologic comparisons published elsewhere support the premise that HeLa DNA polymerases alpha, delta, and epsilon are distinct enzymes that have common properties with yeast DNA polymerases I, III, and II, respectively.\r"

  ".U": "90370847\r", 
  ".W": "We have characterized cDNA and genomic clones coding for a sponge collagen. The partial cDNA has an open reading frame encoding 547 amino acid residues. The conceptual translation product contains a probably incomplete triple-helical domain (307 amino acids) with one Gly-Xaa-Yaa-Zaa imperfection in the otherwise perfect Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats and a carboxyl propeptide (240 amino acids) that includes 7 cysteine residues. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicate that this sponge collagen is homologous to vertebrate and sea urchin fibrillar collagens. Partial characterization of the corresponding gene reveals an intron-exon organization clearly related to the fibrillar collagen gene family. The exons coding for the triple-helical domain are 54 base pairs (bp) or multiples thereof, except for a 57-bp exon containing the Gly-Xaa-Yaa-Zaa coding sequence and for two unusual exons of 126 and 18 bp, respectively. This latter 18-bp exon marks the end of the triple-helical domain, contrary to the other known fibrillar collagen genes that contain exons coding for the junction between the triple-helical domain and the carboxyl propeptide. Compared to other fibrillar collagen genes, the introns are remarkably small. Hybridization to blotted RNAs established that the gene transcript is 4.9 kilobases. Together with previous results that showed the existence of a nonfibrillar collagen in the same species, these data demonstrate that at least two collagen gene families are represented in the most primitive metazoa.\r"

While most SCLC cell lines are anchorage independent for growth, laminin induced the attachment of five of six SCLC cell lines tested (NCI-N417, NCI-H345, NCI-H146, NCI-H187, NCI-H510, and NCI-H209). NCI-N417 SCLC cells adopted a flattened morphology on laminin, and a classic SCLC cell line (NCI-H345) demonstrated a neuron-like appearance while the other SCLC cell lines except NCI-H187 cells, attached but did not spread. Adhesion to laminin was associated with increased resistance to several cytotoxic drugs. Matrigel, an extract of basement membrane proteins, greatly accelerated tumor growth when coinjected with SCLC cells in athymic mice. A synthetic peptide from the B1 chain of laminin, cyclic-YIGSR (Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg), inhibited laminin-induced SCLC cell adhesion and migration in vitro and reduced the size of the tumors they formed when coinjected with matrigel and YIGSR. These results suggest that the interaction of SCLC cells with laminin and possibly with other basement membrane proteins can enhance their tumorigenicity and drug resistance.\r"

Further, there is strong evidence against the Glires concept, which unites Lagomorpha and Rodentia. The radiation among Lagomorpha, Primates, and Artiodactyla--Carnivora is very bush-like, but there is some evidence that Lagomorpha has branched off first. Thus, the branching sequence for these five orders of mammals seems to be Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Primates, Artiodactyla, and Carnivora. The branching date for Rodentia could be as early as 100 million years ago. The rate of nucleotide substitution in the rodent lineage is shown to be at least 1.5 times higher than those in the other four mammalian lineages.\r"

  ".W": "In order to clone the D1 dopamine receptor linked to adenylyl cyclase activation, the polymerase chain reaction was used with highly degenerate primers to selectively amplify a cDNA sequence from NS20Y neuroblastoma cell mRNA. This amplification produced a cDNA fragment exhibiting considerable sequence homology to guanine nucleotide-binding (G)-protein-coupled receptors that have been cloned previously. To characterize this cDNA further, a full-length clone was isolated from a rat striatal library by using the cDNA fragment as a probe. Sequence analysis of this cDNA clone indicated that it is indeed a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family and exhibits greatest homology with the previously cloned catecholamine receptors. Northern blot analysis of various neural tissues revealed a transcript of approximately 4 kb that was predominantly located in the striatum with lesser amounts in the cortex and retina. In contrast, no mRNA was detected in the cerebellum, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, mesencephalon, or pituitary. In situ hybridization analysis also revealed a high abundance of mRNA in the striatum as well as in the olfactory tubercle. To establish the identity of this cDNA, we performed transient expression experiments in COS-7 cells. [3H]SCH-23390, a D1-selective radioligand, exhibited specific, saturable binding only in cells that were transfected with this cDNA. Competition binding analysis with a variety of dopaminergic ligands demonstrated a D1 dopaminergic pharmacology. In addition, dopamine as well as other D1-selective agonists stimulated cAMP accumulation in transfected COS-7 cells. We conclude that we have cloned a cDNA encoding the D1 dopamine receptor linked to the activation of adenylyl cyclase activity.\r"

We have shown that associated with suppression of mammary tumorigenesis there is a reduction or inhibition of circulating prolactin, MMTV particles expressed, and MMTV mRNA transcription in mammary glands (and in most organs tested). To understand the concerted action of prolactin, energy-consumption level, and MMTV on inducing mammary tumors, experiments were designed to control prolactin and energy levels in order to evaluate their effects on MMTV mRNA expression. Mice on restricted diets were grafted with adenohypophyses, and mice fed ad libitum were treated with the dopaminomimetic agent octahydrobenzo [g]quinoline. Adenohypophyseal grafting significantly increased prolactin in dietary (energy)-restricted mice, and this effect was associated with an increase in MMTV mRNA expression within the mammary gland; a linear correlation between prolactin levels and MMTV mRNA expression in the mammary gland was found. Conversely, elimination of the nocturnal peak of circulating prolactin by i.p. injection of dopaminomimetic octahydrobenzo [g]quinoline to mice fed ad libitum delayed (by 8 weeks) and reduced (even as long as 25 weeks) mammary gland MMTV mRNA expression. These findings associate prolactin influences with MMTV mRNA production in mice and help explain the link between chronic energy-intake restriction and reduced MMTV gene expression.\r"

Under noninducing conditions, only the promoter P2 is active and this is responsible for the production of low amounts of regulatory proteins. Upon induction, the other four promoters become active and, by a mechanism that may involve transcriptional and translational regulation, cause a 50-fold increase of the transcriptional activator BvgA.

Cell culture supernatants were collected and tested for TNF-alpha, and total RNA was isolated from cells at various times after stimulation and assessed for TNF-alpha mRNA by Northern blot techniques. The results showed that message for TNF-alpha was produced after 60 min of in vitro stimulation with LPS and was maximal at about 4 hr. TNF-alpha was secreted into the supernatant of unstimulated PMNs from two different donors during 24 hr of culture (35-50 pg/ml), but significantly more (160-190 pg/ml) was secreted by PMNs when stimulated with LPS. PMNs from six other normal volunteers showed significant LPS-stimulated secretion of TNF at 60-180 min of culture. The secreted product also had biological activity against the TNF-sensitive L-M cell line, confirming that PMNs can make and secrete immunologically and biologically active TNF. Since it is also possible for monocytes to synthesize and secrete TNF, the amount of TNF secreted by a monocyte population equal to 20% of the PMNs cultured was measured. The results showed that monocytes at a concentration 20 times that potentially contaminating the PMN populations cultured could not produce as much TNF (unstimulated, 26-65 pg/ml; stimulated, 32-87 pg/ml). The PMN must now be considered a cell capable of altering the acute inflammatory response and modulating the immune response through the synthesis and release of cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "Analogs of somatostatin are being investigated clinically for the treatment of various malignancies, including brain tumors. We studied the ability of three therapeutically promising radioactively labeled somatostatin octapeptide analogs, RC-160, RC-121, and RC-161, to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after peripheral or central injection. After i.v. injection, intact RC-160 was recovered from the blood and the brain. The entry rates were different from each compound but were generally low. By contrast, entry across the intact BBB increased 220 times when RC-160 was given in a serum-free perfusate. This suggests that some serum-related factor, probably the previously described protein binding or an aggregation-promoting factor, is the main determinant in limiting the blood-to-brain passage of somatostatin analogs. Entry into the brain was not inhibited by the addition of unlabeled analog to the perfusate, showing that passage was probably by diffusion across the membranes that comprise the BBB rather than by saturable transport. By contrast, a saturable system was found to transport peptide out of the central nervous system (CNS). The clearance from the CNS of RC-160 and RC-121, but not RC-161, was faster than could be accounted for by reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid. Transport of radioactively labeled RC-160 out of the CNS was inhibited by unlabeled RC-160 or somatostatin but was not affected by some other peptide known to cross the BBB by their own transport systems. More than 80% of the radioactivity recovered from the blood after intracerebroventricular injection of RC-160 was eluted by HPLC at the position of the labeled analog, showing that the peptide had crossed the BBB in intact form. Our results indicate the presence of a saturable transport system in one direction across the BBB for some superactive analogs of somatostatin.\r"

Removal of the carbohydrate from purified hog H+/K(+)ATPase vesicles reveals a 35-kDa peptide that, when fragmented with protease V8, gives sequences homologous to both beta 1 and beta 2 subunits of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase. cDNA clones for a beta subunit of the gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase were isolated from a rabbit stomach cDNA library by using degenerate 17-mer oligonucleotide probes made to the protease V8-treated peptides. An open reading frame (54-926) encodes a predicted 291-amino acid peptide with Mr = 33,320, which exhibits 31% and 44% homologies to the Na+/K+)-ATPase beta 1 and Na+/K(+)-ATPase beta 2 proteins, respectively. A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot predicts a single N-terminal transmembrane domain with a small hydrophobic region near the C terminus. The presumed extracytosolic domain contains seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites and six out of nine cysteines. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of stomach RNA with the rabbit H+/K(+)-ATPase beta probe identifies a single mRNA of 1.3-1.5 kilobases, similar in concentration to the alpha subunit mRNA. The presence of a defined gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase beta subunit extends the homology between H+/K(+)-ATPase and the Na+/K(+)-ATPase subclass of phosphoenzyme transport ATPases and distinguishes them from the monomeric Ca2+ and proton pump subclasses.\r"

The starting material for the purification of the precursor was a peptide fraction purified from pig intestinal extracts, containing peptides with a molecular weight higher than that of secretin. The purification could be followed by measurement of secretin bioactivity (alkali secreted in the pancreatic juice of anesthetized cat). Sequence analysis of the isolated secretin precursor revealed a 71-amino acid residue polypeptide that contained the sequence of secretin N terminally, followed by a Gly-Lys-Arg sequence and a C-terminal extension of 41-amino acid residues. With the exception of an arginine residue, which occurs directly after the Gly-Lys-Arg sequence, the remainder of the C-terminal residues in this precursor are identical to the 40 C-terminal residues predicted by the recently described cDNA sequence for porcine preprosecretin. Compared to the deduced preprosecretin sequence, a stretch of 32 amino acid residues directly following the Gly-Lys-Arg sequence is missing in the now purified secretin precursor. This implies that differential splicing may occur when the secretin gene transcript is processed to mRNA.\r"

To clarify the pathogenetic significance of allele loss on chromosome 16, we performed restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 70 surgically resected tumors by using 15 polymorphic DNA markers for chromosome 16. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 16 was detected in 36 (52%) of 69 informative cases, and the common region of allele loss in these 36 tumors was located between the HP locus (16q22.1) and the CTRB locus (16q22.3-q23.2). These losses occurred more frequently in HCCs of poor differentiation, of larger size, and with metastasis, whereas they were not detected in HCC at the earliest stage. In addition, these losses were not associated with presence or absence of hepatitis B virus DNA integration or hepatitis C virus infection. These results show that loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 16 is a late event occurring after hepatocarcinogenesis and strongly suggest that this phenomenon is involved in enhancement of tumor aggressiveness during progression of HCC.\r"

Subsequently, we observed that two or three irradiations, and to a lesser extent even a single irradiation, were sufficient to induce an impressive increase in the incidence of tumors, particularly in females. A significant reduction of the incidence of radiation-induced tumors resulted when the rats were placed on calorically restricted diet. In experiments reported here, we increased slightly the amount of food given to animals on restricted diet. In the new study, among 102 irradiated females on full diet, 91 (89%) developed tumors, as compared with 29 out of 128 female rats (23%) also irradiated but maintained on restricted diet and 43 out of 89 (48%) untreated control females. None of 77 nonirradiated females on restricted diet developed tumors. Among 65 irradiated male rats, 29 (45%) developed tumors, as compared with 5 out of 74 (7%) rats also irradiated but maintained on restricted diet. Of the 49 males in the nonirradiated groups, 2 (4%) developed tumors. There was a significant weight reduction in both females and males maintained on restricted diet; animals on restricted diet lived longer than those on full diet.\r"

To clone the gene defective in XP complementation group A (XP-A), cDNA clones were isolated by a competition hybridization strategy in which the corresponding mRNAs were more abundant in cells of the obligately heterozygous parents relative to cells of the homozygous proband affected with the disease. In this report, a human genomic DNA clone that contains this cDNA was transformed into two independent homozygous XP-A cell lines, and these transformants displayed partial restoration of resistance to the killing effects of UV irradiation. The abundance of mRNA corresponding to this cDNA appears to correlate well with the observed UV cell survival. The results of unscheduled DNA synthesis after UV exposure indicate that the transformed cells are repair proficient relative to that of the control XP-A cells. However, using this same genomic DNA, transformation of an XP-F cell line did not confer any enhancement of UV survival or promote unscheduled DNA synthesis after UV exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Photoactivation of rhodopsin initiates both excitation and adaptation in vertebrate rod photoreceptors. Bleaching of rhodopsin to free opsin and all-trans-retinal in isolated rods produces a stable desensitization (bleaching adaptation) that is much larger than expected from pigment depletion alone. In our experiments, a 93% bleach produced a 500-fold increase in the light intensity required for saturation of the light response. This component of adaptation was 32-fold larger than the 16-fold increase expected from pigment depletion alone. 11-cis-Retinal, when delivered to isolated rods from liposomes, combines with free opsin to form a bleachable photopigment that fully restores sensitivity. 11-cis-Locked analogues of retinal combine with opsin to form unbleachable pigments in isolated bleached rods from the tiger salamander. They restore sensitivity to a substantial (16- to 25-fold) but incomplete extent. The analogues apparently relieve a stable component of adaptation when they interact with opsin. Because these analogues do not detectably excite rods, the structural requirements of both retinal and opsin for the relief of adaptation are different from those of excitation. The biochemical basis of light adaptation resulting from pigment bleaching and the minimum structural requirements of retinal for its relief remain to be determined.\r"

We now have direct evidence that the purified protein contains components of the cotransporter. Antiserum raised against the bumetanide-binding proteins strongly inhibits Na-K-C1 cotransport measured by two independent methods. Cotransport was induced by hypertonic challenge and was measured as the bumetanide-sensitive portion of unidirectional C1 influx and as regulatory cell volume increase. In both assays, cotransport was strongly inhibited by the antiserum. Fab fragments of the antibodies inhibited cotransport to a similar extent.\r"

Using polyclonal antibodies directed against mouse glycophorin (alpha gp), we have identified a glycoprotein antigenically related to glycophorin on the surface of bovine and rat cultured endothelial cells. Immunoblotting with alpha gp identified a single 60-kDa polypeptide on transfers of SDS/polyacrylamide gels of solubilized confluent endothelial monolayers. In addition, a 60-kDa polypeptide was immunoprecipitated by alpha gp from lysates of 125I-labeled intact endothelial cells. Controls with preimmune serum were negative. This antibody interaction was inhibited by murine erythrocyte ghosts and purified glycophorins. Our past work identified several endothelial surface sialoglycoproteins including a 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) that (i) interacts with albumin, (ii) binds Limax flavus, Ricinus communis, and Triticum vulgare agglutinins but not other lectins, (iii) is sequentially precipitated from 125I-labeled cell lysates by using R. communis agglutinin followed by T. vulgare agglutinin, and (iv) is sensitive to sialidase digestion. Immunoblotting of such precipitates with alpha gp demonstrates that lectins recognize the same glycoprotein, namely gp60. These results indicate that gp60, a major endothelial surface sialoglycoprotein, shares antigenic epitope(s) with glycophorin.\r"

A 671-base pair (bp) stretch of the 5' promoter region was used to direct the expression of the CAT gene in this construct. Of the tissues tested for CAT activity in these transgenic animals only skin with growing hair, isolated hair follicles, and microdissected vibrissae showed substantial levels of activity. These are the same tissues where the endogenous ultra-high-sulfur keratin gene is expressed as shown by in situ hybridization. Furthermore, analysis of the CAT activity during the developmental stages of the hair growth cycle shows that the chimeric gene is expressed during the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle; this is the expected time during development for its expression. From these results we conclude that 671 bp of the promoter sequence from the ultra-high-sulfur keratin gene is sufficient to direct the correct development-specific and tissue-specific expression of the reporter gene construct in transgenic mice. The appropriate expression of the KER-CAT construct in transgenic mice is an important step in understanding the regulation of this gene during hair organogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The accumulation of Cat3 catalase mRNA in the green leaves of maize (Zea mays) exhibits an unusual circadian rhythm. The steady-state level of the Cat3 transcript varies dramatically over the day in seedlings grown on a 12-hr photoperiod. Low or undetectable levels of the Cat3 mRNA are found late in the dark and early in the light period, while the transcript accumulates to high levels late in the light and early in the dark period. This dramatic diurnal variation in mRNA level does not occur with the maize Cat1 or Cat2 catalase transcripts. The diurnal fluctuation in Cat3 mRNA persists when the seedlings are transferred to continuous light or darkness, which indicates the influence of a circadian rhythm. The lack of influence of red and/or far-red light on this diurnal variation in transcript level indicates that the circadian rhythm is not regulated by phytochrome. Run-on transcription assays show that changes in the rate of Cat3 gene transcription closely parallel the observed changes in steady-state mRNA levels. This circadian rhythm in Cat3 gene expression and the resulting high levels of mRNA which accumulate late in the light period suggest that the catalase 3 (CAT-3) isozyme is being synthesized for accumulation in the dark period. This, together with the high level of Cat3 mRNA and CAT-3 protein accumulation in dark-grown maize shoots, suggests that the activity of the CAT-3 isozyme might be associated with a metabolic process important in shoot cells in the dark.\r"

This is the most primitive class of lower vertebrates in which the capacity for acute allograft rejections can be demonstrated, thus suggesting the presence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and, therefore, T cells. Here, we report the identification of two putative MHC-antigen-encoding sequences in the carp Cyprinus carpio. One, identified as TLAI alpha-1, had reasonable homology to MHC class I heavy chains of mammalian and avian species, while the other, identified as TLAII beta-1, was homologous to MHC class II beta chain of the aforementioned higher vertebrates. For these isolations of fish MHC genes, we have identified two highly conserved amino acid sequence blocks surrounding two cysteine residues in the second domain of MHC class II beta chains as well as the third domain of class I heavy chains of humans, mice, and chickens. Two kinds of mixed oligonucleotide probes corresponding to these two regions were synthesized. The carp genomic DNA was subjected to amplification by polymerase chain reaction using the above two synthetic DNA fragments as primers. Subsequently, two different DNA sequences sandwiched by these primers were isolated from the amplified products. Their use as secondary probes led to the identification of TLAI alpha-1 and TLAII beta-1. We also discuss the applicability of the above approach for isolation from lower vertebrates of other genes belonging to the immunoglobulin super-family as well as the evolutionary origin of vertebrate MHC antigens.\r"

  ".U": "90370885\r", 
  ".W": "The C4B isotype of the fourth component of human complement (C4) displays 3- to 4-fold greater hemolytic activity than does its other isotype C4A. This correlates with differences in their covalent binding efficiencies to erythrocytes coated with antibody and complement C1. C4A binds to a greater extent when C1 is on IgG immune aggregates. The differences in covalent binding properties correlate only with amino acid changes between residues 1101 and 1106 (pro-C4 numbering)--namely, Pro-1101, Cys-1102, Leu-1105, and Asp-1106 in C4A and Leu-1101, Ser-1102, Ile-1105, and His-1106 in C4B, which are located in the C4d region of the alpha chain. To more precisely identify the residues that are important for the functional differences, C4A-C4B hybrid proteins were constructed by using recombinant DNA techniques. Comparison of these by hemolytic assay and binding to IgG aggregates showed that the single substitution of aspartic acid for histidine at position 1106 largely accounted for the change in functional activity and nature of the chemical bond formed (ester vs. amide). Surprisingly, substitution of a neutral residue, alanine, for histidine at position 1106 resulted in an increase in binding to immune aggregates without subsequent reduction in the hemolytic activity. This result strongly suggests that position 1106 is not \"catalytic\" as previously proposed but interacts sterically/electrostatically with potential acceptor sites and serves to \"select\" binding sites on potential acceptor molecules.\r"

  ".U": "90370887\r", 
  ".W": "The three-dimensional structure of bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1) complexed with bestatin, a slow-binding inhibitor, has been solved to 3.0-A resolution by the multiple isomorphous replacement method with phase combination and density modification. In addition, the structure of the isomorphous native enzyme has been refined at 2.7-A resolution, and the current crystallographic R factor is 0.169 for a model that includes the two zinc ions and all 487 amino acid residues comprising the asymmetric unit. The enzyme is physiologically active as a hexamer, which has 32 symmetry and is triangular in shape with a triangle edge length of 115 A and maximal thickness of 90 A. The monomers are crystallographically equivalent and each is folded into two unequal alpha/beta domains connected by an alpha-helix to give a comma-like shape with approximate maximal dimensions of 90 x 55 x 55 A3. The secondary structural composition is 40% alpha-helix and 19% beta-strand. The N-terminal domain (160 amino acids) mediates trimer-trimer interactions and does not appear to participate directly in catalysis. The C-terminal domain (327 amino acids) is responsible for catalysis and binds the two zinc ions, which are 2.88 A apart. The pair of metal ions is located near the edge of an eight-stranded, saddle-shaped beta-sheet. One zinc ion is coordinated by carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp-255, Asp-332, and Glu-334 and the carbonyl oxygen of Asp-332. The other zinc ion is coordinated by the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp-255, Asp-273, and Glu-334. The active site also contains two positively charged residues, Lys-250 and Arg-336. The six active sites are themselves located in the interior of the hexamer, where they line a disk-shaped cavity of radius 15 A and thickness 10 A. Access to this cavity is provided by solvent channels that run along the twofold symmetry axes.\r"

Here we show that the \"pure\" antiestrogen ICI 164,384 inhibits mouse estrogen receptor-DNA binding in vitro. The effects of this steroid on DNA binding can be overcome by addition of anti-receptor antibody whose epitope lies N-terminal to the receptor DNA-binding domain. Since this antibody is also capable of restoring DNA-binding activity to receptor mutants that either lack the dimerization domain or bear deleterious mutations within it, we propose that ICI 164,384 reduces DNA binding by interfering with receptor dimerization. In contrast, when complexed with the antagonist/partial agonist tamoxifen, the estrogen receptor is capable of binding to DNA in vitro, but tamoxifen does not promote the agonist-induced conformational change obtained with estradiol. The implications of these data are discussed in relation to the in vivo properties of these drugs.\r"

Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitations of cell lysates prepared from stratified cultures of human epidermal cells showed that the major integrins expressed by keratinocytes are alpha E beta 4 (also called alpha 6 beta 4) and alpha 2 beta 1. The alpha E beta 4 integrin is localized at the surface of basal cells in contact with the basement membrane, whereas alpha 2 beta 1/alpha 3 beta 1 integrins are absent from the basal surface and are localized only on the lateral surface of basal and spinous keratinocytes. Anti-beta 4 antibodies potently inhibited keratinocyte adhesion to matrigel or purified laminin, whereas anti-beta 1 antibodies were ineffective. Only anti-beta 4 antibodies were able to detach established keratinocyte colonies. These data suggest that alpha E beta 4 mediates keratinocyte adhesion to basal lamina, whereas the beta 1 subfamily is involved in cell-cell adhesion of keratinocytes.\r"

  ".U": "90370890\r", 
  ".W": "Mammalian sperm plasma membranes, in contrast to those of mammalian somatic cells, exhibit a significant fraction of lipid that does not diffuse laterally in the plane of the membrane. This nondiffusing fraction results from lipid-lipid interactions. Similar nondiffusing fractions are found in mixed-lipid model systems that contain coexistent gel and fluid domains. These results suggest that the sperm plasma membrane may also exhibit lateral phase segregations of lipids and may contain significant amounts of gel-phase lipid. In this paper we use differential scanning calorimetry to show that, in contrast to the plasma membranes of mammalian somatic cells, the plasma membrane from the anterior region of the head of ram sperm exhibits at least two major endothermic transitions, one centered at approximately 26 degrees C and one centered at approximately 60 degrees C. The heats of these transitions are consistent with gel-to-fluid transitions in model membranes. These transitions are observed both in plasma membrane vesicles and in rehydrated lipid extracts made from these vesicles. These results demonstrate that at physiological temperatures the lipids of the ram sperm plasma membrane are segregated into coexistent fluid and gel domains. Since sperm encounter a wide range of temperatures during their development, these phase transitions may be important in establishing dynamic domains of lipid requisite for epididymal storage and fertilization.\r"

Indeed, the presence of a six-residue-repeated motif that is specific for rodent alpha-caseins strongly supports the identification of this cDNA as mouse alpha-casein. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of many hematopoietic cell types revealed that this gene is restricted to CTL, being expressed in four of six CTL lines examined. Furthermore, CTL that express this gene were also found to express other members of the casein gene family, such as beta- and kappa-casein. These results suggest that caseins may be important in CTL function, and their potential role in CTL-mediated lysis is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "MCF-7 breast tumor cells form multicellular foci in vitro when supplemented with 17 beta-estradiol (E2). In the presence of E2 and the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), MCF-7 cells grow to confluence but do not form foci. To investigate the role of E2 metabolism in this antiestrogenic effect of TCDD, analyses were performed by capillary GC/MS. The results revealed that pretreatment of MCF-7 cultures with TCDD (10 nM) rapidly depletes E2. In untreated cultures supplemented with 10 nM E2, the concentration of free E2 decreased to 4 nM in the first 12 hr, followed by a slower rate of decline. After 3 days most E2 in the medium was in conjugated form(s); 1.7 nM was present as free E2, and 2.9 nM was released by treatment with glucuronidase/sulfatase. In TCDD-treated cultures, E2 declined to 290 pM in 12 hr and after 2 days was not detected (less than 100 pM) either as free steroid or after treatment with glucuronidase/sulfatase. Intracellular E2 and estrone were likewise depleted by pretreatment with TCDD. Microsomes from TCDD-treated cells showed highly elevated aryl hydrocarbon-hydroxylase activity and catalyzed hydroxylations of E2 at C-2, C-4, C-15 alpha, and C-6 alpha with a combined rate of 0.85 nmol/min per nmol of cytochrome P-450 at saturating E2. These results suggest that depletion of E2 by enhanced metabolism accounts for the antiestrogenic activity of TCDD in MCF-7 cells.\r"

In addition, a model of the disparity detector was developed that includes a plausible hierarchical arrangement of cortical cells. Data from the cells compare well with the requirements for the archetypal disparity detector and are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the model.

In addition, during passive presentation of words, but not pseudowords, activation occurred in a left frontal area that is related to semantic processing. These findings support distinctions made in cognitive psychology and computational modeling between high-level visual and semantic computations on single words and describe the anatomy that may underlie these distinctions.\r"

By exploiting the signal inherent in local shear stress on the vessel walls, animals have repeatedly evolved a complex branching hierarchy of vessels approximating a globally optimal system that minimizes the costs of the construction and maintenance of the fluid transport system.\r"

  ".W": "Olfactory transduction is thought to be mediated by a G protein-coupled increase in intracellular adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) that triggers the opening of cAMP-gated cation channels and results in depolarization of the plasma membrane of olfactory neurons. In olfactory neurons isolated from the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, stimulation with olfactory stimuli (amino acids) elicits an influx of calcium that leads to a rapid increase in intracellular calcium. In addition, in a reconstitution assay a plasma membrane calcium channel has been identified that is gated by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which could mediate this calcium influx. Together with previous studies indicating that stimulation with olfactory stimuli leads to stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover in olfactory cilia, these data suggest that an influx of calcium triggered by odor stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover may be an alternate or additional mechanism of olfactory transduction.\r"

Each patient had a large asymptomatic abdominal mass. The tumors ranged in size from 7 to 20 cm (average size, 13 cm) and were evenly distributed throughout the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. One patient had a metastatic tumor to her liver, which was unresectable. All other patients underwent resection, which included two distal pancreatectomies, two total pancreatectomies, one pancreaticoduodenectomy, and one local excision. Four of the seven patients had evidence of local invasions alone, and one had a liver metastasis and local invasion. All patients had the characteristic histologic pattern of a solid and papillary epithelial pancreatic neoplasm. All patients are alive with a mean follow-up of 10 years (range, 4 to 20 years). This is an unusual malignant neoplasm of the pancreas occurring predominantly in young women. Even though they are locally invasive, long-term survival is the rule. Surgical therapy should be aggressive, since liver metastasis may occur.\r"

Histologic sections were reviewed; islet cell tumors and cystadenocarcinomas were carefully excluded. Twenty-six patients were identified. Their mean age was 34 years, with only one patient less than 25 years old. Symptoms included primarily abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice. One third of patients had a recent or past history of pancreatic disease including pancreatitis, pseudocysts, benign cystadenoma, and choledochal cyst. The tumor was located in the head of the gland in 62% of patients. \"Curative\" resections were possible in only three patients (12%); the remaining patients underwent palliative bypass (38%), biopsy alone (42%), or a palliative resection (8%). The hospital mortality rate was 12%, with actual 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates of 19%, 8%, and 4%, respectively, with a median survival of 4 months. The only long-term survivor underwent biliary bypass at age 15 years for a large neoplasm in the head of the gland; despite biopsy-proved liver metastases at that time, she continues to do well 5 years later. Histologic review indicated this tumor to be a \"solid and papillary neoplasm of the pancreas.\" Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in young patients is an aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis behaving much like ductal adenocarcinoma in older patients (greater than 40 years). In rare instances a more favorable outcome can be expected when a solid and papillary neoplasm is found.\r"

There were no significant differences with respect to age, sex, initial tumor stage, interval since operation, and premorbid weight/height2 (body mass index). The lowest postoperative body mass index (BMI) was 72% +/- 3% of the preillness BMI in patients with Roux-en-Y reconstruction and 79% +/- 2% in patients with jejunal interposition (p less than 0.05). At the time of the study the relative BMI was 88% +/- 2% of the preillness BMI in patients with jejunal interposition but only 81% +/- 3% in patients with the Roux-en-Y reconstruction (p less than 0.01). Muscle mass and lean body mass estimated from anthropometric and bioelectric impedance measurements were correlated with sex (p = 0.0001) and with the mode of reconstruction (p = 0.02) independently, which was confirmed by multiple linear regression. The postprandial symptoms were not significantly associated with changes in body composition except for an inverse relationship between Sigstad's dumping score and the extracellular mass/body cell mass ratio (r = 0.553; p = 0.0002). Of the patients under 60 years of age, 10 of 15 patients with jejunal interposition and two of eight patients with Roux-en-Y reconstruction were back at work (p = 0.057). The persons who had resumed their work had a significantly higher relative BMI (90% +/- 2% vs 82% +/- 3%), lean body mass (53 +/- 3 kg vs 46 +/- 3 kg), and muscle mass (25 +/- 2 kg vs 21 +/- 1 kg) than persons in early retirement. We concluded that preserving the duodenal transit should be a main objective of gastric replacement after total gastrectomy.\r"

Therefore extensive resection of the bile ducts combined with hepatic resection is the procedure of choice.

One patient died of staphylococcal sepsis on the postoperative day 42 after right trisegmentectomy and resection of the bile ducts, a hospital death rate of 4%. Twenty-four patients were discharged from the hospital. The 5-year actuarial survival rate calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 19%. Four patients lived longer than 5 years after surgery; the longest survival was 9 years after right trisegmentectomy and resection of the bile ducts. These four patients had clear margins at the resected bile ducts. This article was designed to clarify the point at issue by presenting our results in terms of indications, operative morbidity and mortality, and long-term survival.\r"

We have tested this hypothesis in a rat model, in which liver and peritoneal micrometastases were induced by the injection of cultured colonic cancer spheroids into both the portal vein and peritoneal cavity, respectively. Sixty-seven tumor-bearing animals were randomized to receive either no treatment, superior mesenteric vein 5-FU, or intraperitoneal 5-FU. Infusions were begun 2 days after tumor inoculation at a dose of 45 mg/kg/day and continued for 5 days. All untreated animals had advanced liver and peritoneal metastases 1 month after tumor implantation. Intraperitoneal 5-FU totally prevented the development of macroscopic tumor on peritoneal surfaces in 57% of animals. Paradoxically, rats treated with portal vein 5-FU had significantly more tumor or peritoneal surfaces than did the untreated group (p = 0.038). Both intraperitoneal and portal vein chemotherapy resulted in approximately a 50% reduction in total liver metastases compared with untreated animals (p = 0.78). Comparison of hepatic tumor growth within different lobes or segments demonstrated that although intraperitoneal 5-FU produced a homogeneous reduction in liver metastases, the effect of portal vein chemotherapy was unevenly distributed. We conclude that intraperitoneal chemotherapy was not only effective in eradicating peritoneal micrometastases but also received the same overall reduction in liver metastases as did portal vein chemotherapy. Moreover, regional differences in hepatic tumor responses as a result of drug streaming during portal vein 5-FU infusion were not observed after intraperitoneal chemotherapy.\r"

Twenty-three patients with 27 skin ulcers who had been receiving conventional wound care with no evidence of healing for an average period of 25 weeks (range, 12 to 156 weeks) were studied. The patients were first subjected to controlled wound care for 3 months, with saline solution and silver sulfadiazine dressings used in all cases. At the end of this period, persistent nonhealing ulcers were treated by topical use of HPDWHF and silver sulfadiazine. Ulcer parameters were recorded on the first day and every week during therapy until complete epithelization was achieved in either group. Each ulcer acted as its own control. In the controlled wound care group, only three ulcers in three patients achieved complete healing; the remaining 24 ulcers in 20 patients failed to achieve even 50% healing in the stipulated 3-month period. However, when subjected to HPDWHF applications, these ulcers healed completely, 100% healing occurring in 9.67 +/- 4.9 weeks (range, 3 to 19 weeks), which is highly significant (p less than 0.01). The healing response to HPDWHF applications was of uniform progression over the weeks. Only the basic cause of the ulcer determined the healing rates in this group. The shortest and the longest time to achieve 100% healing occurred in patients with diabetes (6.88 +/- 2.97 weeks) and in the venous stasis group (14.00 +/- 7.07 weeks). Age, sex, location of ulcer, ulcer duration, and ulcer measurements had no influence on the HPDWHF-stimulated healing rates. This is the earliest report of HPDWHF-stimulated repair in chronic nonhealing skin ulcers.\r"

The site of narrowing was the sigmoid colon in 12 patients and the rectum in two patients. The strictures occurred after anastomosis in seven patients, with carcinoma in four patients, and with inflammatory disease, external compression, and idiopathy in one patient each. Although combinations of endoscopic techniques were occasionally used, the predominant method responsible for successful management of the narrowing was bouginage in four patients, endoscopy with a prototype dilating endoscope in four patients, balloon dilatation in three patients, and electrocautery and laser surgery in one patient each. There were no perforations or bleeding complications. Repeated treatments were usually needed. As less invasive methods evolve to treat colonic narrowing, appropriate matching of available techniques with the underlying disease becomes easier. We have found that dilation with a bougie, balloon, or a prototype dilating endoscope can provide especially beneficial results when used on patients with strictures resulting from inflammatory disease or external compression. Cutting and ablating tools such as the electrocautery and laser tools are more suited for management of strictures that result from carcinoma and anastomotic webs. Appropriate matching of endoscopic technique to underlying colonic pathology will allow increasingly successful and safer management of colonic narrowing without operation.\r"

In addition, we monitored oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation (LP), using malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes. Sixteen adult sheep with lung and soft tissue lymph fistulas were given 20 breaths of smoke while under anesthesia. Eight sheep were given a tidal volume of 5 ml/kg smoke, confining the inflammatory injury to airways only. Eight sheep were given 10 ml/kg smoke after which focal alveolar collapse and a carboxyhemoglobin level of 28% +/- 5% were noted in addition to airways injury. No significant lung or systemic physiologic changes were noted in the 5 ml/kg smoke exposure. However, plasma levels of malondialdehyde increased significantly, indicating that LP had occurred. With the 10 ml/kg smoke exposure, a 50% early decrease in oxygen consumption was noted. At 12 hours, oxygen consumption was then significantly increased by 30% over baseline. Fluid requirements to maintain filling pressures were also significantly increased, comparable to that seen after a 20% total body surface burn. A change in soft tissue permeability was noted with a twofold increase in systemic lymph, which could in part explain the fluid requirements. Lung lymph flow increased by only twofold, and lung water was not increased, whereas arterial partial oxygen pressure decreased from a baseline of 95 +/- 4 mm Hg to 60 +/- 5 mm Hg. Systemic LP was evident when both plasma malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes increased significantly. Liver tissue malondialdehyde at postmortem examination was double the normal level. However, lung parenchymal malondialdehyde was not increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Exogenously administered cholecystokinin is a potent stimulant of pancreatic exocrine secretion and pancreatic polypeptide release. Release of cholecystokinin by amino acids and fats is strongly correlated with both pancreatic exocrine secretion and pancreatic polypeptide release. Despite this correlation, direct evidence that cholecystokinin is a physiologic mediator of these actions is not available. We have studied this problem in fasted dogs with chronic pancreatic fistulas by means of a specific cholecystokinin antagonist, proglumide, to inhibit the effect of cholecystokinin. Secretion, neurotensin (with secretin stimulation infusion), or cholecystokinin-octapeptide was infused intravenously, either with saline solution or with proglumide (300 mg/kg/hr). For endogenous release of cholecystokinin, intraduodenal infusions of phenylalanine and tryptophan or of sodium oleate were given with either intravenous saline solution or intravenous proglumide. Pancreatic secretion and release of cholecystokinin and pancreatic polypeptide were measured in plasma. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide stimulated pancreatic secretion of water and protein; both of these were significantly inhibited by proglumide. Intraduodenal amino acids and sodium oleate both caused significant release of cholecystokinin, which was not altered by proglumide; however, proglumide inhibited pancreatic secretion stimulated by intraduodenal amino acids and sodium oleate. Release of pancreatic polypeptide stimulated by amino acid and sodium oleate was also significantly inhibited by proglumide. Since proglumide appears to block actions of cholecystokinin, our results show that cholecystokinin is physiologically important for pancreatic secretion and for release of pancreatic polypeptide.\r"

The marked biochemical alterations associated with shock and MOF include clinically important changes in gene expression, such as altered rates of albumin and procoagulant synthesis. To characterize the MOF-associated changes at the cellular level, sequential liver biopsies were obtained from a swine model of cardiogenic shock associated with MOF. Preshock and postresuscitation biopsies were used not only to create a complementary DNA (cDNA) library but also to screen, to confirm, and, in nine out of 12 cases, to specifically identify genes whose expression is enhanced at least fivefold after resuscitation. The twelve genes thus characterized can be separated according to function into distinct groups, including the acute-phase genes and the heat-shock genes. Expression of acute-phase genes is liver specific and is essential for systemic homeostasis; heat-shock gene expression is generic to all cells and important for intracellular homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "After an acute episode of pancreatitis, a 63-year-old man was found to have a pancreatic glucagonoma. The tumor was resected without evidence of metastases. Three years later he had symptoms of uncontrolled diabetes, no skin lesions, and diarrhea and was found to have a pancreatic pseudocyst and multiple hepatic metastases. Glucagon concentrations were raised but were suppressible by glucose and somatostatin and responded to arginine stimulation. He was treated for 6 months with octreotide (Sandostatin), which reduced his symptoms; the pseudocyst resolved, but liver metastases continued to grow. Although spontaneous resolution of the pseudocyst is possible, this case appears to illustrate differences in sensitivity of endocrine and exocrine tissues to suppression by Sandostatin.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of lung resection on exercise capacity and perception of symptoms were studied in 47 patients aged 39-73 (mean 58.3) years. Twenty had a pneumonectomy and 27 a lobectomy, all for lung cancer. Forced expiratory volume, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, and progressive maximal one minute incremental cycle ergometer exercise performance were measured before and after surgery. Breathlessness and leg discomfort were assessed with a modified Borg scale (0-10). Mean FEV1 decreased from 79% (SD 22%) to 53% (11%) of the predicted value after pneumonectomy and from 89% (22%) to 74% (18%) after lobectomy. Exercise capacity, measured as the highest work load completed, Wmax, decreased from 78% (25%) to 58% (28%) predicted in the pneumonectomy group and from 77% (21%) to 67% (20%) in the lobectomy group. There was only a weak relation between changes in FEV1 and changes in Wmax (r = 0.54, r2 = 0.30). The slope of the relation between the intensity of dyspnoea and work load or the intensity of dyspnoea and ventilation increased significantly after pneumonectomy, but not after lobectomy. Leg discomfort increased more rapidly when related to work load after both pneumonectomy and lobectomy. After resection dyspnoea was rarely the only limiting factor at maximal exercise. It is concluded that (1) change in FEV1 is a poor predictor of change in exercise capacity after lung resection; (2) pneumonectomy results in a 25% decrease in Wmax and in an appreciable increase in dyspnoea during exercise; (3) lobectomy has little or no effect on Wmax or the intensity of postoperative dyspnoea; (4) after both pneumonectomy and lobectomy leg discomfort makes an important contribution to exercise limitation.\r"

  ".U": "90371512\r", 
  ".W": "In an attempt to improve selection of patients and the efficacy of endoscopic laser treatment, a bronchographic technique has been developed for patients with tumours causing complete endobronchial obstruction. This technique has shown patent distal airways in 16 out of 17 patients with a collapsed lung or lobe. These airways were abnormally dilated in each case, suggesting bronchiectasis. In one patient the appearances of bronchiectasis were sufficiently severe to decide against attempting treatment. Treatment was not attempted in another patient as a large cavity was seen within the collapsed lung and this was thought to carry a risk of postoperative infection and haemorrhage. Treatment with a neodymium YAG laser under general anaesthesia successfully recanalised the airway in 12 of the 15 remaining patients and was associated with a substantial reduction in breathlessness. The procedure was abandoned prematurely in one patient because of life threatening haemorrhage. In the remaining two patients in whom treatment was unsuccessful bronchography had suggested very extensive endobronchial obstruction. Spirometry and radionuclide lung scans were performed before and after treatment in eight patients treated successfully and showed significant improvements. Four patients were investigated within two weeks of lung re-expansion by repeat bronchography (three patients) or computed tomography (one patient); in each case the calibre of the airways had returned almost to normal. Thus the radiological demonstration of bronchial dilation in a collapsed lung does not necessarily imply a diagnosis of irreversible bronchiectasis and should not be regarded as a contraindication to treatment. It is concluded that preoperative bronchography provides reliable data on the extent of tumour, the patency of the distal airways, and presence of extensive cavitation. This information should facilitate successful laser treatment.\r"

Symptoms, lung function, and chest radiographic and bronchoscopic findings were recorded serially before and after 81 cryotherapy sessions in 33 consecutive patients. Most patients improved in terms of overall symptoms, stridor, and haemoptysis and they had an overall improvement in dyspnoea. Objective improvement in lung function was seen in 58% of patients and the changes in lung function correlated with symptoms. Bronchoscopic evidence of relief of bronchial obstruction was seen in 77% of patients and 24% showed improvement in degree of collapse on the radiograph. There were no important complications. These results compare favourably with the results in published series of patients having laser therapy. It is concluded that bronchoscopic cryotherapy is valuable for the palliation of inoperable bronchial carcinoma.\r"

Subjects were subdivided according to whether the FEV1/FVC ratio was under 65%, 65-75%, or over 75%. The influence of smoking on TLCO was accounted for by expressing TLCO as a percentage of the expected value-that is, of the value expected from the reported cigarette consumption. The 63 subjects who gave a history of physician confirmed asthma in reply to a questionnaire tended to have high values for TLCO, even when FEV1/FVC was reduced. In the absence of a given diagnosis of asthma, however, TLCO and TLCO/VA were reduced when the FEV1/FVC ratio was reduced, whether or not a clinical diagnosis of emphysema had been reported. This suggests that these subjects may have undiagnosed emphysema. This cross sectional analysis of our survey data suggests that subjects in our sample with spirometric evidence of chronic airflow obstruction have different forms of disease, characterised by different physiological features, in addition to the different risk factors and clinical courses reported earlier.\r"

  ".W": "Baseline airway geometry is thought to be an important determinant of the airway response to challenge; this geometry is altered by changing posture. The effect of changes in posture on airway calibre, midtidal lung volume, and the airway response to inhaled histamine was studied in eight healthy subjects (four female; mean (SD) age 29.8 (5.1) years, FEV1 3.54 (0.65) 1). Each subject was studied in both sitting and supine postures on two days; airway calibre was assessed by measuring total respiratory resistance (Rrs) at 6 Hz with a forced oscillation technique applied over 16 seconds of tidal breathing. Appropriate doses of histamine were selected by preliminary experiments and were always inhaled with the subject in the supine posture. Midtidal lung volume was larger in the sitting (2.9 (0.8) 1) than in the supine posture (2.4 (0.5) 1). Baseline Rrs was lower in the sitting than in the supine posture (2.03 (0.44) and 3.12 (0.76) cm H2O.1(-1).s*). The mean absolute increase in Rrs after the same dose of histamine was 1.22 cm H2O.1(-1).s in the sitting position (65.8% increase over baseline) and 1.39 cm H2O.1(-1).s (48.8% increase over baseline) in the supine position. The geometric mean provocation concentration of histamine causing a given percentage increase in Rrs was similar in the sitting (8.26 mg/ml) and supine (8.65 mg/ml) positions. Thus there was no significant increase in responsiveness after the reduction of airway dimensions and extra-airway distending forces that occurs in the supine posture.\r"

Twenty four patients had radiologically proved bronchiectasis and 14 had mucus hypersecretion without radiological evidence of bronchiectasis. None was having an acute exacerbation at the time of the scan. The median 24 hour volume of sputum expectorated was 17 (range 2-175) ml. The 24 hour volume of purulent sputum was 5 (0-142) ml; six patients expectorated mucoid sputum only. Twenty one of the 38 patients had a positive granulocyte lung scan. All nine patients expectorating more than 20 ml purulent sputum in 24 hours had positive lung scans and all had lost more than 19% of the indium-111 from the body after five to seven days. Of the six patients with mucoid sputum, only one had a positive scan and these subjects lost only 6-11% of the indium-111 in five to seven days. The percentage loss of indium-111 from the body correlated with 24 hour purulent sputum volume (r = 0.41, n = 38, p less than 0.001) and total elastolytic activity in 24 hour sputum (r = 0.54, n = 14, p less than 0.01). The loss of indium-111 was not related to the extent of bronchiectasis when purulent sputum volume was allowed for. Indium-111 labelled granulocyte scanning provides a sensitive and objective method for detecting inflammation in the lungs and should help to improve understanding of chronic bronchial sepsis and possibly treatment in selected cases.\r"

  ".W": "Growth hormone is a secretory product of some primary bronchial neoplasms and has been associated with the development of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy and acromegaly in occasional patients with such tumours; it has not, however, generally been considered important in the pathogenesis of digital clubbing. Plasma levels of growth hormone at the time of diagnostic bronchoscopy were measured in 60 patients with histologically proved bronchial carcinoma, divided according to whether clubbing was present (n = 21) or absent (n = 39), and in 13 control subjects undergoing the same procedure but with no neoplasm. The median plasma level of growth hormone ( and interquartile range) was 0.74 (0.5-1.0) mU/l in five control subjects with no pulmonary disease, 0.83 (0.4-1.3) mU/l in eight subjects with non-neoplastic pulmonary disease, 1.1 (0.6-3.3) mU/l in patients with carcinoma but without clubbing, and 3.1 (0.8-9.0) mU/l in 21 patients with carcinoma and clubbing. The highest growth hormone level was seen in a patient with a small cell carcinoma and pronounced clubbing; levels had fallen to normal by the time chemotherapy was completed and clubbing completely resolved. Thus growth hormone or a similar substance might have a role in the pathogenesis of clubbing in patients with bronchial neoplasms.\r"

The date or month of onset was determined in 308 cases, of which 51 were classified as intracerebral hemorrhage, 223 as cerebral infarction, and 27 as subarachnoid hemorrhage. We observed a significant seasonality in the incidence of all stroke (p less than 0.01), of intracerebral hemorrhage (p less than 0.05), and of cerebral infarction (p less than 0.01), whereas subarachnoid hemorrhage had no significant seasonal pattern. Subjects less than 64 years of age showed a significant seasonal variation in the incidence of both intracerebral hemorrhage (p less than 0.05) and cerebral infarction (p less than 0.01). A significant seasonal pattern for the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage was also noted among persons with hypertension (p less than 0.05) or a high serum cholesterol level (p less than 0.05), whereas such a pattern for cerebral infarction was documented among normotensive persons (p less than 0.05) and those with a low serum cholesterol level (p less than 0.01). In addition, the incidences of intracerebral hemorrhage and cerebral infarction were negatively correlated with mean ambient temperature (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively), and all stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage in men were significantly related to intradiurnal temperature change (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively). The significance of the seasonal occurrence of stroke is discussed in relation to relevant risk factors.\r"

Beginning in 1979, however the annual rate of decline in stroke mortality began to slow considerably. Comparing the period 1979-1986 with the previous decade, a 57% slowing in the absolute rate of decline (as estimated by the slope of the linear portion of the mortality curve) was observed for white men; the corresponding slowdowns in the rate of decline were 58% for white women, 44% for black men, and 62% for black women. If the decline during the 1980s had continued at the rate observed for the period 1968/73-1978, there would have been 131,000 fewer stroke deaths during the period 1979-1986, 28,000 fewer in 1986 alone. This slowdown in the rate of decline in stroke mortality is occurring while mortality rates for both coronary heart disease and all causes are leveling off. The reasons for this change in the mortality trend remain unknown, and corresponding trends in the treatment and control of hypertension do not provide an entirely satisfactory explanation.\r"

  ".W": "Although the development and use of severity-of-illness measures has gained widespread enthusiasm, uncertainty remains as to the optimal measure for stroke patients. The Health Care Financing Administration recently derived a severity-of-illness measure based on the APACHE II system to explain differences in Medicare mortality rates among hospitals treating stroke patients. We hypothesized that the Glasgow Coma Scale score provides prognostic information of accuracy comparable to that of the APACHE II score for stroke patients, yet is simpler and cheaper to abstract from the medical record. We therefore studied 246 patients hospitalized with stroke, including 49 oversampled mortalities. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was as accurate as the APACHE II score in predicting stroke mortality both before (r = -0.50 and r = 0.50, respectively) and after (r = -0.40 and r = 0.38, respectively) the oversampled mortalities were excluded. The APACHE II score required abstraction of 16 variables from the medical record compared with three for the Glasgow Coma Scale score and required more than three times the time to abstract from the medical record. Therefore, in the interest of parsimonious data collection, the Glasgow Coma Scale may be a preferable severity-of-illness measure for patients with stroke.\r"

Nimodipine was given to 21 patients, intravenously for 7-10 days and then orally until 21 days after the subarachnoid hemorrhage. The other 20 patients received placebo in a similar manner. Nimodipine did not significantly influence platelet aggregability. For the first 1-5 days after the subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine treatment did not have any notable effect on adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet thromboxane B2 release, but a significant (p less than 0.05) inhibitory effect was observed thereafter. During intravenous administration, nimodipine prevented the increase in thromboxane release otherwise observed after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Concomitant with the decrease in thromboxane release, nimodipine increased the platelet count both before and after surgery so that the capacity for thromboxane formation per liter of blood decreased less than expected on the basis of thromboxane release per 10(7) platelets. Our study suggests that nimodipine might diminish the chance of cerebral ischemia by inhibiting platelet thromboxane release.\r"

Patients received a loading bolus of the drug followed by a maintenance intravenous infusion for 7 days. The plasma level of ORG 10172 was monitored by the degree of inhibition of coagulation factor Xa. In general, the drug was well tolerated and few hemorrhagic complications occurred. Two patients with large cardioembolic hemispheric strokes had intracranial hemorrhagic complications. Most patients improved during treatment. By 3 months after the stroke, 37 patients (65%) had a favorable outcome (minimal or no residual disability). This study suggests that high-dose intravenous infusions of ORG 10172 can be safely given to patients with acute ischemic stroke.\r"

Global cortical blood flow was very highly significantly increased above baseline measures in all subjects by 50% N2O (mean increase 37% above 100% O2 condition). A smaller but still significant increase was observed with 25% N2O. Analysis of regional cortical blood flow revealed heterogeneity in the pattern of changes; that is, the baseline pattern was altered by the inhalation of N2O, most often resulting in an accentuation of relative frontal blood flow. The anterior-posterior gradient in N2O-induced blood flow changes differs from that observed with simple vasodilatory agents, such as CO2, with which the increase is purely systemic and the baseline pattern is preserved. This indicates that N2O has differential effects on cerebral metabolism that may well reflect the typical alterations in experiential state reported by subjects.\r"

For 50 infarcts, we found an arterial occlusion. The intracranial part of the vertebral artery was involved in 38 infarcts (76%), the basilar artery in 20 infarcts (40%), and a cerebellar artery in 12 infarcts (24%). Eight infarcts were due to bilateral distal vertebral artery occlusions. For the 50 infarcts, the cause of the occlusion was atherosclerosis in 28 (56%) and a cardiac embolism in 12 (24%). For the remaining 38 infarcts, we found no arterial occlusions on postmortem examination. Of these 38 infarcts, 26 (68%) were associated with a cardiac source of emboli. For the entire group of 88 infarcts, atherosclerosis was the cause in 31 (35%), while a cardiac embolism was proven or presumed in 38 (43%). Dissecting aneurysms, atherosclerotic artery-to-artery embolism, or hemodynamic mechanisms could have been responsible for a few infarcts. We conclude that cerebellar infarcts often arise from cardiogenic embolism.\r"

The bolus intravenous administration of 25,000 units of liposome-entrapped CuZn-superoxide dismutase elevated superoxide dismutase activities in the blood and brain 1, 2, 8, and 24 hours later as well as in the ischemic hemisphere and contralateral cortex. Determined 24 hours after right middle cerebral and bilateral common carotid artery occlusion by the lack of staining for mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, infarct sizes were reduced by 33%, 25%, and 18% in the anterior, middle, and posterior brain slices, respectively, by treatment with liposome-entrapped CuZn-superoxide dismutase. Our data demonstrate that superoxide radicals are important determinants of infarct size following focal cerebral ischemia and that liposome-entrapped CuZn-superoxide dismutase may have pharmacologic value for the treatment of focal cerebral ischemic injury.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the neuropathological consequences of global forebrain ischemia under normothermia versus mild hyperthermia. Twenty-one rats underwent 20 minutes of four-vessel occlusion during which brain temperature was maintained at either 37 degrees C (normothermia, n = 9) or 39 degrees C (hyperthermia, n = 12). Quantitative neuropathological assessment was conducted 1 or 3 days later. At 1 day following the ischemic insult, normothermic rats demonstrated neuronal injury mainly confined to the most dorsolateral striatum. By 3 days, ischemic cells were present throughout the striatum and CA1 hippocampus in normothermic animals. Compared with normothermic rats, intraischemic hyperthermia significantly increased the extent and severity of brain damage at 1 day after the ischemic insult. Areas of severe neuronal necrosis and frank infarction included the cerebral cortex, CA1 hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. Morphologic damage was also detected in the cerebellum and pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. An overall mortality rate of 83% was demonstrated at 3 days in the hyperthermic ischemic group. We conclude that intraischemic hyperthermia 1) markedly augments ischemic brain damage and mortality compared with normothermia, 2) transforms ischemic cell injury into frank infarction, and 3) accelerates the morphological appearance of ischemic brain injury in regions usually demonstrating delayed neuronal necrosis. These observations on mild hyperthermia may have important implications for patients undergoing cardiac or cerebrovascular surgery as well as patients following cardiac arrest or those with stroke-in-evolution.\r"

Phenytoin (10 mg/kg i.v.) was administered 30 minutes before the onset of ischemia induced in 30 male Wistar rats by occluding the basilar and both common carotid arteries. The rats' brains were frozen in situ after 0, 5, or 30 minutes of ischemia or 10, 30, or 60 minutes of recirculation following 30 minutes of ischemia (n = 5 at each time). Nucleoside triphosphate levels were higher in the phenytoin-treated rats than in corresponding untreated rats at each time during and after ischemia. Phenytoin significantly attenuated the accumulation of lactate and free fatty acids (arachidonic acid and stearic acid) during ischemia and accelerated their recovery during recirculation. These results suggest that phenytoin has favorable protective effects on ischemic brain and that phenytoin may inhibit calcium-mediated phenomena, especially the inositol cycle, in cerebral ischemia.\r"

We divided the rats into four groups. In the control group (n = 8) neither hematocrit nor blood pressure was manipulated during occlusion, in the hemodilution group (n = 8) 5% albumin was administered to maintain a hematocrit of 30% during occlusion, in the hypertension group (n = 8) mean arterial blood pressure was increased to 30 mm Hg above baseline during occlusion with phenylephrine, and in the hemodilution/hypertension group (n = 8) albumin and phenylephrine were employed simultaneously during occlusion. We assessed the amount of cerebral hemorrhage (as concentration of extravasated hemoglobin) spectrophotometrically and the extent of ischemic injury (as percentage of the hemisphere with deficient staining) histochemically using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Mean +/- SD hemoglobin concentration in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occlusion in the hemodilution/hypertension group (71 +/- 14 micrograms/g brain tissue) was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than that in the hemodilution and hypertension groups (25 +/- 5 and 29 +/- 7 micrograms/g, respectively), hemoglobin concentrations in these two groups were in turn significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than that in the control group (2 +/- 3 micrograms/g). Mean +/- SD percentage of the ipsilateral hemisphere with deficient staining was significantly (p less than 0.05) less in the hypertension and hemodilution hypertension groups (8 +/- 3% and 11 +/- 6%, respectively) than in the control and hemodilution groups (26 +/- 8% and 26 +/- 7%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
