  ".W": "A number of mechanisms participate in the hepatic injury that occurs during and following liver transplantation. A normal allograft regenerative response is probably essential for a successful transplant outcome. In this study, the effect of cyclosporine, a potent immunosuppressant used routinely after liver transplantation, on the regenerative response of the liver after partial hepatectomy was investigated. Male Wistar rats were pretreated for one week with either cyclosporine or the olive oil vehicle and were subjected to either a two-thirds partial hepatectomy or a sham operation. Animals were sacrificed at various times postoperatively and the remnant livers were weighed to determine the liver weight to body weight ratio, two biochemical measures of a regenerative response (cytosolic ornithine decarboxylase activity and thymidine kinase activity), and the hepatic content of estrogen and androgen receptors, as the content of these receptors has been shown to modulate, at least in part, the subsequent hepatic regenerative response. The preoperative hepatic cytosol content of ornithine decarboxylase, thymidine kinase, and estrogen receptor was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in rats pretreated with cyclosporine than in those treated with the vehicle alone. A significant increase in ornithine decarboxylase and thymidine kinase activities occurred after partial hepatectomy in both the cyclosporine-pretreated and vehicle-pretreated animals. The absolute levels for each parameter were also greater in the cyclosporine-treated animals than in the vehicle-treated controls at 24 hr after partial hepatectomy (P less than 0.05). The pattern of change in the hepatic cytosolic content of estrogen and androgen receptors in both groups of animals was comparable with those described previously for regenerating liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have compared a Clark-type flow-dependent oxygen electrode having a 3-mm-diameter cathode applied to the surface of rabbit liver to an electromagnetic flowmeter (EMF) on the portal vein. Reduction in portal flow (ranging from 4 to 100% and maintained over 2 min), correlated with reduction in electrode output (r = 0.944, P less than 0.001). Electrode output was independent of systemic arterial PO2 (ranging from 85 to 340 mm Hg) (P greater than 0.99) and thus of oxygen in inspired gases. These results indicate that this electrode gives a continuous indication of portal venous inflow when hepatic central inflow is undisturbed and may thus prove to be a useful tool in the clinical assessment of liver perfusion.\r"

They consist mainly of high-amplitude retrograde contractions and inhibition of motility before and after these contractions. The recordings of 94 episodes of emesis occurring spontaneously, during manometric studies of intestinal motility by means of infused catheters in dogs with gastric and duodenal cannulae, showed that 95.7% of all episodes developed during phase II of the migratory motor complex. In order to establish whether different phases of the fasting cyclic activity are associated with a different sensitivity to emetic stimulus, two agents, apomorphine, a centrally acting drug and copper sulfate, a peripherally acting agent, were administered at the beginning of phases I and II of the migratory motor complex. Coincident with spontaneously occurring vomiting, a statistically significative greater number of responses to both emetic agents was observed during phase II as compared to phase I. This finding suggests that cyclic changes of the small bowel motility are related to changes in the threshold of the vomiting center.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were undertaken to characterize the physiological fate of the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-type I receptor complex in MG-63, an IGF-responsive human osteosarcoma cell line. To investigate this, a photoreactive iodinated derivative of IGF-I [5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyl-125I-IGF-I (ANBz-125I-IGF-I)] was synthesized. This derivative retained biological activity and photolabeled a cell surface component on MG-63 cells with the size and binding specificity characteristic of the type I IGF receptor. To assess the stability of the photoaffinity-labeled IGF-I receptor complex, quiescent monolayers of MG-63 cells were incubated with ANBz-125I-IGF-I at 2 C, photolyzed, and then warmed to 37 C. At various times the monolayers were solubilized and the receptor complex was identified by quantitative autoradiography after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under these conditions the photoaffinity-labeled IGF-I receptor complex was relatively stable, with a half-life of 11 +/- 2 h in five experiments. To determine if the complex undergoes internalization, its susceptibility to hydrolysis by trypsin at 2 C was measured. When cells that were labeled at 2 C were warmed to 37 C, a trypsin-insensitive band appeared within 20 min, reached a maximum by 1 h, and declined thereafter; however, an average of only 7% (5-8% in four experiments) of the total labeled receptor pool was present intracellularly at 1 h, and this declined to less than 1% by 4 h. A similar distribution of receptors was observed in cells photolabeled after incubation with ANBz-125I-IGF-I at 37 C, indicating that this distribution was not the result of altered metabolism of the photolabeled receptor complex. Lysosomotropic agents inhibited degradation of the complex, but did not alter its distribution between the cell surface and interior. These results indicated that the IGF-I-type I receptor complex is relatively stable and does not undergo rapid ligand-induced down-regulation and degradation. These observations suggest a model in which the IGF-receptor complex functions while present at or near the cell surface.\r"

  ".W": "The mouse prostate is an attractive model for studying the relationship between epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and the mechanism of androgen action because of the volume of information on tissue interactions in the development of the prostate of this species and the existence of a mutant mouse lacking functional androgen receptors (Tfm mouse). In this paper the major proteins of the mouse dorsolateral prostate (DLP) have been described, and antibodies to these proteins have been characterized. The two most abundant secreted proteins were of 110,000-115,000 (Mj1) and 55,000-62,000 (Mj2) mol wt. They were glycosylated, androgen dependent, and appeared to exist in an oligomeric complex. Antibodies raised against mouse DLP secretion reacted mainly with Mj1, Mj2, and a minor protein of 140,000 mol wt (Mn1). The antibodies were of a high titer and recognized these three mouse DLP proteins by Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemical techniques. Mj1 and Mj2 were antigenically similar to proteins in the mouse coagulating gland and in the rat DLP, but were not found in other organs. Immunocytochemical staining of the DLP from intact mice revealed many ducts that were lined by a tall columnar epithelium whose cells stained intensely. However, ducts that were distended with luminal secretion had a low columnar epithelium that rarely showed intracellular staining. These marker proteins and the antibodies to them will be useful for detecting androgen-dependent functional activity in tissue recombinant studies with a variety of experimental tissues.\r"

In the present study we have examined whether cGMP mediates the inhibitory effect of corticosterone in perifused isolated rat anterior pituitary cells. A brief 22.5-min exposure to corticosterone strongly inhibited ACTH secretion evoked by arginine vasopressin (AVP), 48 mM KC1, and two types of combined stimuli, i.e. 41-residue CRF and AVP (0.05 and 0.5 nM, respectively; CRF/AVP), or ionomycin and phorbol-dibutyrate (200 and 10 nM, respectively; PdBu/IM). The time course of inhibition by corticosterone was similar in all cases; a rapid approximately 30% reduction in ACTH was evident within 25 min, which increased to 60% by 50-70 min and will be referred to as the delayed effect. The corticosteroid inhibition of PdBu/IM-induced ACTH release was fully antagonized by the glucocorticoid/progestin antagonist RU 38486, indicating that it is exerted through type II glucocorticoid receptors. In contrast to corticosterone, the cGMP derivative 8-bromo-cGMP failed to suppress ACTH release evoked by PdBu/IM, whereas it effectively inhibited the action of CRF/AVP. Furthermore, ionomycin reversed the reduction of CRF/AVP-stimulated ACTH release by 8-bromo-cGMP, but had no effect on the delayed inhibition caused by corticosterone. These data indicate that there are two distinct cellular pathways of inhibiting stimulus-evoked ACTH secretion in vitro. One of these is activated by corticosterone, whereas the other involves cGMP as a cellular messenger.\r"

Two groups of six ewes were fed a diet of either 1000 g/day (normal feeding) or 400-600 g/day (restricted feeding) hay for 20 weeks. Restricted feeding increased mean plasma GH concentrations and the amplitude of GH pulses, but did not affect GH pulse frequency. In contrast, mean plasma LH and FSH concentrations and LH pulse frequency were decreased by restricted feeding. Mean plasma PRL concentrations were unaffected by treatment. The levels of mRNA for GH in pituitary cytosol were increased by restricted feeding, but no changes were seen in mRNA levels of alpha-subunit, LH beta, FSH beta, or PRL. The pituitary contents of hormones measured did not change with the level of feeding. In conclusion, these data show that long term restricted feeding affects anterior pituitary function in adult ewes, presumably reflecting alterations in the secretion of hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting factors.\r"

To evaluate further the actions of PG synthesis inhibitors in primate luteal function, we examined the in vitro effects of Mec and another inhibitor, flurbiprofen (Flur), on PG, cAMP, and progesterone (P) production by macaque luteal tissue obtained at midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle. First, collagenase dispersed luteal cells were incubated with 0-100 microM Mec or Flur, either alone or in the presence of 10 microM arachidonic acid (AA) to assess PGF2 alpha and PGE2 synthesis. Levels of both PGF2 alpha and PGE2 were stimulated (P less than 0.05) by AA (3.3- and 5.8-fold, respectively). Maximal suppression (P less than 0.01) of basal and AA-stimulated PGF2 alpha and PGE2 synthesis was elicited by 1 microM Mec and Flur. Second, adenylate cyclase activity, measured by the conversion of alpha 32P-ATP to alpha 32P-cAMP, was monitored in luteal homogenates exposed to increasing doses of Mec and Flur either alone or with maximal stimulatory doses of hCG, PGE2, or PGI2. Mec elicited a dose-dependent reduction (P less than 0.01) in control activity (incubated with 50 microM GTP), as well as inhibiting hCG- and PG-stimulated activity. The presence of 100 microM Mec suppressed (P less than 0.01) hCG-, PGE2- and PGI2-stimulated activity to control levels, but had no effect on activity stimulated by GMP-P(NH)P or forskolin. In contrast, Flur at any dose did not alter control activity or that stimulated by hormonal or nonhormonal activators. Third, P production by dispersed luteal cells was quantified during exposure to 0, 1, and 100 microM Mec or Flur alone or with maximal stimulatory doses of hCG, PGE2, PGD2, 6 beta PGI1, PGA2, or dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP). All hormones and dbcAMP stimulated (P less than 0.01) P synthesis 2-3 fold over basal levels, except PGA2, which had no effect. The presence of 100 microM Mec reduced (P less than 0.01) basal P production by 62% and abolished (P less than 0.05) hCG-, PG-, and dbcAMP-induced stimulation. Conversely, neither 1 microM Mec nor either dose of Flur affected P synthesis in the absence or presence of hormones or dbcAMP. These data indicate that: 1) Mec and Flur are potent inhibitors of PG synthesis in primate luteal cells in vitro and 2) higher doses of Mec suppress PG- and gonadotropin-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity and P production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Protein kinase-C (PKC) has been suggested as a possible mediator of the antigonadotropic action of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) in luteal cells. To examine this possibility, we evaluated the effects of phorbol ester [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)] in relation to those of PGF2 alpha on cAMP accumulation and ATP levels as well as on the subcellular distribution of PKC activity in rat luteal cell cultures. Treatment of luteal cells for 1 h with TPA or PGF2 alpha produced a dose-dependent inhibition of LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Maximal inhibition produced by PGF2 alpha was about 35% greater than that produced by TPA. Moreover, PGF2 alpha produced a further inhibition of LH action when the cells were maximally inhibited by TPA. Staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, reversed inhibition of LH-dependent cAMP accumulation produced by TPA, but had no effect on the response to PGF2 alpha. Furthermore, cells in which PKC was persistently activated by prolonged TPA treatment lost their responsiveness to additional TPA, but continued to show inhibition of cAMP accumulation by PGF2 alpha. TPA also produced a dose-dependent decrease in cell levels of ATP in contrast to PGF2 alpha. Finally, TPA produced a rapid redistribution of PKC activity from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction, whereas PGF2 alpha produced only a slight redistribution. We conclude that the acute antigonadotropic action of PGF2 alpha in rat luteal cells occurs via mechanisms other than phorbol ester-sensitive PKC activation.\r"

  ".W": "The 9S nonactivated oligomeric estrogen receptor from fetal guinea pig uterus interacts with the H222 monoclonal antibody (whose epitope is located in the hormone-binding domain) to yield an 11S complex and with the H226 monoclonal antibody (whose epitope is located in the A/B region, just N-terminal to the DNA-binding domain) to yield a 9.4S complex. No reaction was detected with the D547 monoclonal antibody (whose epitope is located between the hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains). In high salt gradients, the 11S oligomeric receptor-H222 complex dissociates to a 8S monomer-H222 complex and the 9.4S oligomeric receptor-H226 complex to a 7S monomer-H226 complex plus the 4.5S monomer receptor not bound to the antibody. These observations suggest that the nonactivated oligomeric receptor contains more than one estradiol-binding subunit with a structure such that the H222 epitopes are fully accessible, the H226 epitopes are partially accessible, and the D547 epitopes are masked. The temperature-activated receptor reacts with the H226 antibody to yield two complexes that sediment at 7S and 9S in high salt gradients. The 9S complex corresponds to a receptor form complexed with more than one antibody molecule; therefore, this suggests the formation of a receptor homodimer where the two H226 epitopes are exposed. However, a single 8S peak is observed when the H222 antibody reacts with the activated receptor, suggesting that only one H222 epitope is accessible in the dimeric receptor. In addition, binding to the H222 antibody before activation prevents dimerization. Thus, the H222 appears to be close to the dimerization domain. The activated receptor reacts with the D547 antibody to yield a 8S complex that apparently contains only one antibody molecule. On the other hand, the receptor extracted from nuclei was found to be a single 5.5S form with the same immunological characteristics as the receptor activated in cytosol. In conclusion, interaction of these monoclonal antibodies with the different forms of the estrogen receptor reveals a structural transformation during activation, with a concomitant change in the exposure of the receptor functional domains.\r"

We synthesized these steroids by bioreduction of aldosterone with intestinal bacteria. Mineralocorticoid agonist activity of 21-deoxy-Aldo, 21-deoxy-THAldo and THAldo, determined by bioassay using adrenalectomized rats, was 1-5%, less than 0.01%, and 0.1-0.5% that of aldosterone, respectively. 21-Deoxy-Aldo showed no antagonist activity. The relative affinity in competing with [3H]aldosterone for binding to mineralocorticoid receptors in adrenalectomized rat kidney cytosols was 94%, less than 0.01%, and less than 0.01% that of aldosterone. The relative binding affinity for rat renal glucocorticoid receptors was 23%, less than 0.01%, and less than 0.01% that of dexamethasone, and for corticosteroid-binding globulin 17%, less than 0.01%, and less than 0.01% that of cortisol. These results show that the naturally occurring steroid, 21-deoxy-Aldo, possesses mineralocorticoid agonist activity which is equivalent to that of 11-deoxycorticosterone, and has substantial affinity for rat renal mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. The results also implicate the pathophysiological role of 21-deoxy-Aldo as a potential mineralocorticoid in 21-hydroxylase deficiency, where urinary excretion of this steroid is invariably elevated.\r"

  ".U": "90168761\r", 
  ".W": "We have studied regulation of the glucose transporter by thyroid hormone in ARL 15 cells, a thyroid hormone-responsive cell line derived from rat liver, T3 treatment (5 x 10(-8) M for 48 h) of confluent cell monolayers grown in thyroid hormone-deficient medium increased the rate of uptake of [3H] 2-deoxyglucose by 2.3 +/- 0.2-fold; this effect was half-maximal at a T3 concentration of 5 nM. The uptake of the nonmetabolizable hexose [3H]3-O-methylglucose was comparably increased, confirming a stimulation of glucose transport by thyroid hormone in these cells. In addition to enhancing glucose transporter activity, T3 increased the utilization of medium glucose to a similar degree. To elucidate the mechanism of the stimulation of glucose transport by T3, the number of glucose transporter units in crude membrane preparations was quantitated by measuring the glucose-inhibitable binding of [3H]cytochalasin-B. The Kd for specific (glucose-inhibitable) binding of [3H]cytochalasin-B was 50-60 nM, a value typical for nonhepatic glucose transporters. T3 treatment caused an increase in the glucose-inhibitable binding of this ligand that was similar in magnitude to the stimulation of [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake (2.5 +/- 0.6-fold). Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA using a cDNA probe for the rat brain glucose transporter showed a strong 2.9-kilobase hybridization signal after stringent washing, indicating that ARL 15 cells express the specific mRNA for this type of glucose transporter. T3 treatment increased the abundance of this mRNA by 2.3 +/- 0.2-fold. It is concluded that thyroid hormone stimulates glucose transport in ARL 15 cells, which express the brain type of glucose transporter. This effect is attributable at least in part, if not entirely, to an increase in the level of glucose transporter mRNA and an accompanying increase in the number of glucose transporter units. These findings suggest that thyroid hormone may be an important regulator of glucose transporter gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "The involvement of hypothalamic histaminergic neurons in the stress-induced release of peripheral catecholamines was studied in conscious, freely moving male rats. Blood samples were obtained via a catheter in a femoral artery. Intracerebroventricular infusion of histamine (HA; 30 micrograms) increased the plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) 3- and 9-fold, respectively. The plasma level of dopamine was not affected. The effect of HA was prevented by prior intracerebroventricular infusion of the H1-receptor antagonist mepyramine (100 micrograms) or the H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine (100 micrograms). Restraint stress applied for 5 min caused an immediate but transient increase in the plasma concentrations of NE and E which were increased 5- and 11-fold, respectively. The plasma level of dopamine was not altered significantly by restraint stress. The effect of stress on NE and E was almost prevented by prior icv infusion of mepyramine or cimetidine. The HA receptor antagonists had no effect on the basal plasma catecholamine level. We conclude that neuronal HA is an important mediator of the restraint stress-induced release of peripheral catecholamines by an action on H1- and H2-receptors within the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that complement component C3 is regulated by estradiol in the rat uterus. The antiestrogens tamoxifen, LY117018, and LY156758 exert both agonist and antagonist effects on the immature rat uterus. In this study, these three antiestrogens also stimulated an increase in the synthesis and secretion of C3. The combination of LY117018 and estradiol did not increase C3 to a greater extent than LY117018 alone, which suggests a similar mechanism of regulation. The regulation may be transcriptional since both estradiol and tamoxifen increase the concentration of C3 mRNA. Results of in situ hybridization revealed that the increase in C3 mRNA occurred in the luminal epithelial cells. Although the induction by estradiol and the antiestrogens was similar in most aspects, the time course for tamoxifen-stimulated synthesis differed from estradiol in that the time required to achieve maximal concentrations of C3 was delayed by 12 h with tamoxifen. This pattern did not appear to be related to the time it took to convert tamoxifen to 4-hydroxytamoxifen since the C3 response for these antiestrogens were identical. The antiestrogen-stimulated increase in C3 synthesis and mRNA concentration was prevented by the co-administration of progesterone lending support to the hypothesis that the antiestrogens regulate C3 synthesis via a mechanism similar to estrogen.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of steroidal and nonsteroidal \"anti-androgens\" on the proliferative capacity of androgen-sensitive LNCaP-FGC human prostate tumor cells in culture was studied using charcoal-dextran stripped human serum-supplemented media. Cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone acetates, flutamide, hydroxyflutamide, and anandron (R23908) were administered alone at concentrations between 3 X 10(-12) and 3 X 10(-6) M. Results indicated that although medroxyprogesterone induced maximal proliferation at 3 X 10(-9) M, the other \"anti-androgens\" (with the exception of flutamide that was ineffective) were effective at 3 X 10(-8) M and higher concentrations; the amplitude of the proliferative response by these compounds was comparable to that elicited by estradiol-17 beta (3 to 5-fold over control). None of the anti-androgens tested triggered the shutoff effect characteristic of androgen action. When 3 X 10(-10) M DHT and the above mentioned anti-androgens were administered simultaneously, a synergistic pattern was seen; on the contrary, 3 X 10(-8) M DHT cancelled the proliferative effect of each of the anti-androgens when administered simultaneously. The relative binding affinity of these anti-androgens to androgen receptors present in LNCaP-FGC cells did not correlate well with their proliferative efficiency. The data collected were interpreted within the premises of the negative control hypotheses for the regulation of cell proliferation in metazoans. Within those premises, results became compatible with the notion that first, \"anti-androgens\" elicited the proliferation of androgen-sensitive cells by neutralizing the effect of a serum-borne inhibitor (androcolyone-I); this event seems not to be mediated by androgens receptors. Second, anti-androgens did not trigger a proliferative shutoff response like androgens do, i.e. the proliferative pattern induced by anti-androgens was comparable to that elicited by estrogens and progestins. Third, when administered simultaneously with 3 X 10(-10) M DHT, anti-androgens behaved synergistically. Fourth, the DHT-induced shutoff effect consistently overrode the proliferative effect generated by anti-androgens and estrogens when added alone. Finally, taken together these results raise important questions regarding the therapeutic role of anti-androgens in prostate cancer.\r"

[3H]Leucine pulse-chase experiments were performed to study the rate of Tg secretion in the presence and absence of dMM (1 mM) or Cs (1.6 mM). After a 15-h chase period, dMM and Cs did not modify the relative proportions of released Tg (65% in the follicular content, 16% in the medium) and cellular Tg (19%). In contrast, Cs led to a lower rate of secretion in both secretory pathways (t1/2 increased from 42 min to 105 min in the apical pathway and from 108 min to 138 min in the basal pathway). After a long-term labeling (16 h) with [3H]leucine or [3H]mannose, drugs did not notably affect the relative proportions of labeled Tg in the different compartments (follicular content, medium, and cell). The structures of N-glycans borne by Tg, with and without drugs, were checked. After Tg immunoprecipitation, pronase-glycopeptides were fractionated on concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B. The glycopeptides tightly bound to the lectin were treated by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and oligosaccharides separated by HPLC. With dMM, complex-type glycans of Tg were totally replaced by high mannose-type glycans, Man8-9GlcNAc; Cs induced the accumulation of glucosylated high mannose-type structures, Glc3Man7-9GlcNAc and Glc2Man8-9GlcNAc, but the action of this inhibitor was not total. In conclusion the correct secretion of Tg does not require the presence of the sialyllactosaminyl structure; the presence of glucose residues on high mannose-type structures lowers the rate of exocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) may be a major cause of the humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The circulating form of PTHrP is unknown, but mRNA analysis of tumor tissue suggests that multiple forms of PTHrP may exist. Therefore, we examined the ability of the full 141-amino acid protein as well as 2 amino-terminal fragments, PTHrP-(1-34) and PTHrP-(1-74), to increase cytosolic calcium ion concentrations ([Ca2+]i; assessed by aequorin luminescence) and stimulate cAMP accumulation in osteoblast-like rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8). PTH and all PTH-related peptides examined increased [Ca2+]i and cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner. The [Ca2+]i response to PTHrP-(1-34) closely resembled that to rat PTH-(1-34); both peptides produced biphasic responses. However, the responses to the longer PTHrP fragments generally were not biphasic. There were no significant differences among the three PTHrP forms in increasing [Ca2+]i or stimulating cAMP accumulation, although PTHrP-(1-74) was consistently weaker than the other two PTHrP peptides. PTHrP-(1-34) was more potent than rPTH-(1-34), which, in turn, was more potent than human PTH-(1-34) in increasing [Ca2+]i. However, PTHrP-(1-34) was not consistently more potent than either human PTH-(1-34) or rat PTH-(1-34) in stimulating cAMP accumulation. The inhibitory PTH analog bovine PTH-(3-34) attenuated both cAMP and [Ca2+]i responses to PTHrP-(1-34), but bovine PTH-(7-34) only reduced the [Ca2+]i response. Our data are generally consistent with PTHrP's acting through the PTH receptor, but differences in the effects of inhibitory PTH analogs on PTH and PTHrP action suggest as yet unexplained complexities, such as the existence of a PTH/PTHrP receptor family.\r"

  ".U": "90168769\r", 
  ".W": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP) acts on at least two receptor types, classified on the basis of their second messengers. The V1 receptor acts via mobilization of intracellular calcium through phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and influences blood pressure and hepatic glycogenolysis. The V2 receptor acts via cAMP through activation of adenylate cyclase and causes antidiuresis. Previous studies of the different AVP receptors have been hampered by the use of nonselective radioligands, such as [3H]AVP (which binds to all types of V1 and V2 receptors, certain oxytocin receptors, and neurophysins) as well as the difficulty of measurement of second messengers. This paper describes the use of selective V1 and V2 radioligands with in vitro autoradiography to study V1 and V2 binding sites in rat tissues. [125I][1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid), 7-sarcosine] arginine vasopressin ([125I][d(CH2)5,Sarcosine7]AVP), a selective V1 antagonist radioligand, bound to regions of the brain, testis, superior cervical ganglion, liver, blood vessels, and renal medulla. Pharmacological characterization of [125I][d(CH2)5,Sarcosine7]AVP binding was consistent with that expected for binding to V1 receptors. There was no specific binding demonstrable to pituitary, renal glomeruli, gut, heart, spinal cord, ovary, adrenal medulla, or adrenal cortex. [3H]1-deamino [8-D-arginine] vasopressin [( 3H]DDAVP), a potent V2 receptor agonist radioligand, was used to study V2 receptors. Specific binding was only identified in the kidney consistent with the known distribution of antidiuretic V2 receptors on renal collecting tubules. No binding was demonstrated on endothelium or liver where DDAVP might influence clotting factor release, nor in the brain, spinal cord, sympathetic ganglia, heart or vascular smooth muscle, regions where DDAVP might cause vasodilatation. These studies demonstrate the use of these radioligands to study V1 and V2 receptors in a variety of tissues. Also, since these ligands are selective they are of particular use to study the different receptor subtypes in tissues where V1 and V2 receptors coexist, such as in the kidney.\r"

We continuously cultured FRTL cells in the absence of TSH and found that another type of cell appeared in the culture. The new cells were large, flattened and epithelial-like, and none of them exhibited thyroglobulin immunoreactivity. Since they grew independently of TSH, we further cloned these mutated cells by the limited dilution method in the absence of TSH. cAMP production in the cloned cells (FRTL-Tc) was stimulated dose-dependently by TSH. The TSH concentration that produced a maximal level of cAMP in FRTL-Tc cells was 1 order of magnitude higher than in FRTL cells. A [125I]TSH binding study confirmed that the FRTL-Tc cells had TSH receptors with the same binding capacity but a higher Kd than those of FRTL cells. A [125I]cyanopindolol binding study revealed that the FRTL-Tc cells had acquired beta 2-adrenergic receptors and that isoproterenol or epinephrine could stimulate cAMP production in the cells. TSH or beta-adrenergic agonists inhibited the growth of these cells, as did (Bu)2cAMP. When FRTL-Tc cells were transplanted into the sc tissue in Fisher rats, they grew as a tumor in all of the animals (n = 10). Metastasis of the tumors to the lung and liver occurred. These results indicate that FRTL-Tc cells are malignantly transformed cells with TSH receptors derived from thyroid epithelial cells and also suggest that the role of cAMP in the proliferation of the transformed cells might be different from that in normal cells.\r"

  ".W": "Adipsin gene expression is greatly diminished in certain forms of genetic and acquired obesity. In the present study we evaluate the time course for the development of adipsin deficiency in obesity and its regulation by the sympathomimetic-thermogenic drug mixture ephedrine and caffeine. Previously, it was unknown whether adipsin deficiency occurred before or after the development of massive obesity. In the first series of experiments in which mice were treated with monosodium glutamate (MSG) for the first week of life, we demonstrate that adipsin deficiency occurs early in the development of MSG-induced obesity as evidenced by decreased circulating adipsin concentrations by 1 week of age and deficient adipsin mRNA levels in white adipose tissue (WAT) by 2 weeks. In db/db mice, diminished circulating adipsin was noted at 2 weeks of age. In both models, decreased adipsin gene expression precedes the development of marked obesity. Little is known about the factors which regulate adipsin gene expression in obesity. Common to the ob/ob, db/db and MSG models is diminished thermogenesis and sympathetic nervous system activity. In a second series of experiments we sought to determine whether adipsin deficiency in obesity could be corrected by treatment with ephedrine and caffeine (E+C), a sympathomimetic-thermogenic mixture previously shown to increase thermogenesis and reverse obesity in some models. In the present study, E+C treatment of MSG obese mice reversed obesity and markedly increased serum adipsin and adipsin mRNA levels in WAT and brown adipose tissue (BAT). In ob/ob mice, however, E+C treatment produced a negligible increase in adipsin mRNA levels in WAT and BAT as well as serum adipsin concentrations and this correlated with only a very small decrease in obesity. Thus, the ability of E+C to increase adipsin gene expression correlated with its ability to reverse obesity in these two models. Finally, the effect of E+C on adipsin gene expression may not be exerted directly on the fat cell since treatment of cultured 3T3-F442A adipocytes and isolated rat adipocytes in primary culture produced no effect on adipsin mRNA or secreted protein despite a lipolytic effect as measured by increased glycerol release. In summary, decreased adipsin gene expression occurs early in the development of MSG and db/db obesity and is markedly increased in the MSG model by the sympathomimetic-thermogenic drug mixture, E+C, which also reverses obesity. Elucidation of the factors responsible for these effects may enhance our understanding of fat cell gene regulation and obesity.\r"

The hypothalamic type I enzyme is relatively resistant to activation by the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or diacylglycerol (DG). Both type II and type III enzymes of hypothalamus and pituitary were responsive to TPA or DG stimulation, with the hypothalamic subspecies being less responsive. Binding of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate revealed different binding properties among the various subspecies, with the pituitary enzymes displaying higher affinities than the respective hypothalamic counterparts. The results demonstrate heterogeneity in protein kinase-subspecies expression and responsiveness to TPA and DG and suggest specific roles for the subspecies in the hypothalamo-pituitary axis.\r"

  ".W": "This study has determined the route of secretion of inhibin-alpha into blood by the rat testis during sexual maturation, and in adult animals in which Leydig cell steroidogenesis was stimulated with human CG (hCG) or suppressed with aminoglutethimide. In each rat, inhibin-alpha levels were measured in samples of testicular (TV), spermatic (SV), and peripheral (PV) venous blood plasma, and in testicular interstitial fluid (IF). The IF and TV plasma reflect inhibin-alpha secretion via the base of the Sertoli cell while that secreted via the apex of the Sertoli cell (which is resorbed from the rete testis) was determined from the difference between SV and TV levels of inhibin-alpha. During sexual maturation, inhibin-alpha levels in IF and all plasma samples declined from maximal values at 28 days of age to minimal values at 100 days of age, in contrast to testosterone levels which showed the reverse pattern. There was a major change with age in the route of secretion of inhibin-alpha from the testis into blood. In immature (28-35 days) rats, most inhibin-alpha (58-65%) leaving the testis in blood was derived from that secreted via the base of the Sertoli cell with a relatively small contribution (35-42%) from apically-secreted inhibin-alpha. However, the latter made a progressively increasing contribution between 45 and 100 days of age (adults) and in adult rats the vast majority of inhibin-alpha (95%) leaving the testis in blood was derived from apically-secreted inhibin-alpha. This change was due primarily to a progressive reduction with age in the secretion of inhibin-alpha via the base of the Sertoli cell, a change which was confirmed by inhibin bioassay. Stimulation of steroidogenesis in the adult testis with hCG significantly increased inhibin-alpha and testosterone levels in IF and all plasma samples. The concomitant administration of hCG and aminoglutethimide (to block steroidogenesis) prevented the hCG-induced increase in testosterone levels, but still led to significant increases in inhibin-alpha secretion which were comparable to those seen with the use of hCG alone. The administration of aminoglutethimide (AMG) on its own did not alter the inhibin-alpha secretion profile from that seen in controls, but it did significantly reduce the levels of testosterone in all fluids. In rats treated with hCG +/- AMG there was a small change in the route of secretion of inhibin-alpha into blood, with an increased contribution (24-37%) from inhibin-alpha secreted via the base of the Sertoli cell, when compared with controls (7-16%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These inhibitory effects of cortisol are the converse of the observed anabolic influences of the endogenously produced insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I); therefore, cortisol was examined for its effect on the production of IGF-I in osteoblast (Ob)- and fibroblast/preosteoblast-enriched cell cultures prepared from fetal rat parietal bone. Synthesis of IGF-I was monitored by Northern blot analysis to determine steady state IGF-I mRNA levels and by an IGF-I-specific RIA to quantitate polypeptide levels in acidified and fractionated culture medium. Cortisol at 100 nM decreased IGF-I transcript levels by 60% or more in Ob cultures within 6 h of treatment, and the concentration of immunoreactive IGF-I by 50% after 24 h; these effects were observed in the absence of a change in cellular DNA content. In Ob cultures, PTH at 10 nM increased IGF-I transcripts at 6 h and polypeptide levels at 24 h by 2.5- and 4.1-fold, respectively, and cortisol opposed this effect. The inhibitory effect of cortisol was not specific for the Ob cell population, since at 100 nM it also decreased IGF-I transcript and immunoreactive IGF-I levels in fibroblast/preosteoblast cultures and opposed the stimulation of IGF-I synthesis after treatment with 100 ng/ml GH. In conclusion, high levels of cortisol decrease skeletal IGF-I synthesis by reducing IGF-I transcript levels, and this effect probably contributes to the inhibitory influence of cortisol on bone formation.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the ability of cortisol to modulate the stimulatory effects of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) on collagen synthesis, procollagen messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and DNA synthesis in 21-day fetal rat calvariae maintained in serum-free organ culture for 24-96 h. Collagen synthesis was quantitated by measuring the incorporation of [3H]proline into collagenase-digestible protein (CDP) and alpha-1(I) procollagen mRNA transcripts were assessed by Northern blot analysis. Cell replication was quantitated by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into bone. As described previously, 100 nM cortisol had a biphasic effect on CDP labeling, increasing CDP after 24 h and decreasing CDP after 48, 72, and 96 h of culture. IGF-I alone increased CDP labeling by 1.6-fold after 24 h and by 2-fold after 48 or 72 h of culture, and cortisol potentiated this anabolic effect. In the presence of 100 nM cortisol, IGF-I increased CDP labeling by 2.6-fold after 24 h, by 5-fold after 48 h, and by 8-fold after 72 h of culture. A higher concentration of cortisol (1000 nM) also potentiated the IGF-I response on CDP labeling after 96 h of culture. In the presence of 100 nM cortisol, concentrations of IGF-I lower than 10 nM consistently increased CDP labeling and the percent collagen synthesized whereas these concentrations were not always effective without cortisol. PTH, which like cortisol decreased basal CDP labeling, did not enhance the stimulatory effects of IGF-I. Cortisol also enhance the stimulatory effects of IGF-I on alpha-1(I) procollagen mRNA levels indicating that the potentiation of CDP labeling occurs via a pretranslational mechanism. IGF-I had little effect on the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into bone except in the presence of cortisol. Nevertheless, the ability of cortisol to potentiate the stimulatory effect of IGF-I on CDP labeling was independent of cell replication since the enhancement persisted in the presence of aphidicolin, a DNA synthesis inhibitor. Our findings show that physiological concentrations of cortisol can modulate the responsiveness of cells within cultured fetal rat calvariae to the anabolic effects of exogenous IGF-I.\r"

  ".W": "Neuromedin-N (NN) and neurotensin (NT) were shown recently to be encoded in the same precursor molecule. Colocalization and corelease of ileal NT and NN have not yet been demonstrated and were investigated in the rat using antisera that separately recognized intact NT and NN in ileal extracts. Immunofluorescence labeling of full thickness ileal wall revealed that NN-positive fluorescence was only found in the N-cells. However, only 50% of the N-cells also contained NN-like immunoreactivity (NN-LI). This was associated with a level of extractable NN that was 5-fold lower than that of NT. Corelease of NN- and NT-LI was investigated with the isolated, vascularly perfused jejunoileum model by using various substances that were described as potent stimulants of NT release in vivo. Luminal infusion of mixed nutrients, oleic acid (100 mM), glucose (5%), and taurocholic acid (1%) induced a well sustained release of NT, with plateau secretion of about 200%, 120%, 300%, and 700% above basal, respectively. Vascular bombesin (10(-7) M) and carbachol (10(-5) M) provoked a biphasic release of NT, consisting of a transient rise (approximately 600% above basal) followed by a less pronounced but sustained response. HPLC analysis of portal effluent revealed that 70-80% of NT-LI was intact NT. NN-LI was not coreleased with NT even upon vascular coinfusion of phenanthroline, which markedly protected exogenously infused NN. The coexistence but lack of corelease to any significant degree of NN with NT suggests different fates of these two precursor-related peptides within the ileal mucosa.\r"

  ".U": "90168786\r", 
  ".W": "Chondrocytes, derived from a tissue that remains as permanent hyaline cartilage in vivo (embryonic chicken caudal sterna) were treated with 10(-8) to 10(-8) M 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. These nonadherent rounded chondrocytes acquired an adherent, polygonal morphology in a dose-dependent fashion with 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. During the first 4 days of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment cell flattening was associated with a 10-fold increase in beta-actin and fibronectin and their corresponding messenger RNAs (mRNAs). After adherence over the 12 days of continuous hormone treatment, a 2- to 4-fold increase in DNA synthesis and DNA accumulation were observed for the highest hormone dose (10(-8) M). Over the same time course total collagen synthesis decreased 35-50% primarily due to decreased type II collagen synthesis, which accompanied comparable decreases in its mRNA. In contrast, both alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) showed a continuous 5- to 10-fold increase; however, type I collagen protein synthesis remained undetectable, indicating translational control of the type I collagen synthesis. alpha 1(X) mRNAs showed a 2- 3-fold increase after 12 days of hormone treatment, and its polypeptide was clearly detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel analysis. Type IX collagen synthesis showed a 2-fold increase in synthesis and its mRNA levels during the first 4 days of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment but thereafter had levels comparable to control cultures. Analysis of proteoglycan synthesis and core protein mRNA levels showed there was a 2-fold increase in core protein mRNAs while proteoglycan synthesis, as assessed by 35S incorporation, showed only a 10-20% increase. Direct hormone effects vs. those secondary to altered cellular morphology were determined by blocking cell adherence by growth of the 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cultures on bacteriological petri dishes. All of the observed effects on cytoskeletal and collagen mRNAs were blocked except the elevations observed in proteoglycan core protein and alpha 1(IX) mRNAs. DNA contents in hormone-treated cultures also remained elevated. These results suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 both activates and suppresses specific genes, promoting chondrocyte maturation toward a more hypertrophic phenotype. However, prevention of the initial morphological alterations that are induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 blocks many of the subsequent changes in connective tissue expression.\r"

Sertoli cells, isolated from the testes of 20-day-old rats, exhibited decreased transferrin production in response to EDS at a dose of 0.3 mM. The suppression of transferrin synthesis by EDS reached a maximum (15% of control) with a dose of 1.1 mM, without significant cell mortality. An EDS dose of 2.7 mM proved lethal to Sertoli cells, reducing the number of viable cells per well by 85%. Sertoli cells preincubated with a sublethal dose of EDS (0.3-0.5 mM) appeared to recover upon removal of EDS from the culture medium, as evidenced by an increase in transferrin mRNA levels. Sertoli cells given 2.7 mM EDS did not recover. These data demonstrate a direct cytotoxic effect of EDS on Sertoli cell function at relatively low doses and a lethal effect of the alkylating agent at high doses. These results also indicate that EDS may affect Sertoli cells in vivo and, consequently, directly affect the function of the seminiferous epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "We reported that TSH, which stimulates cAMP accumulation and proliferation of FRTL-5 thyroid cells, chronically increases the 1,2-diacylglycerol (1,2-DG) content of FRTL-5 cells. Because activation of inositol lipid hydrolysis by a phospholipase-C enzyme would generate 1,2-DG, we compared the effects of TSH on inositol lipid metabolism to TSH-induced increases in 1,2-DG content and stimulation of cAMP accumulation and cell growth. Acute stimulation of inositol lipid hydrolysis did not occur with doses of 1000 microU/ml or lower, but did occur with TSH doses of 3000 microU/ml and higher, with rates between 1-4%/h. More importantly, in cells chronically exposed to TSH, the rate of inositol lipid hydrolysis was increased only at TSH doses of 10,000 microU/ml or greater, and the maximum rate was 4-5%/h. When cells were growth arrested by TSH deprivation, there was no change in the content of inositol phosphates or polyphosphoinositides. In contrast to the high doses of TSH required to stimulate inositol lipid hydrolysis, TSH-induced elevation of 1,2-DG content and stimulation of cAMP accumulation and growth occurred at physiological TSH concentrations, with minimal effective doses in the range of 1-10 microU TSH/ml, and half-maximally effective doses between 50-200 microU TSH/ml. These data suggest that inositol lipid hydrolysis does not mediate the proliferative response to TSH in FRTL-5 cells and is not the mechanism by which increases in 1,2-DG content occur at physiological TSH concentrations.\r"

The present study examines this issue using the technique of Western blotting, which permitted visualization of 11 GH variants with apparent mol wt ranging from 14-88K. Electroelution of the higher mol wt variants from gels followed by their chemical reduction with beta-mercaptoethanol increased GH immunoassayability by about 5-fold. With the blot procedure we found 1) that GH aggregates greater than 44K were associated with a 40,000 x g sedimentable fraction; 2) that GH aggregates were not present in glands from thyroidectomized rats, but were in glands from the thyroidectomized rats injected with T4; 3) that GH aggregates were uniquely associated with a heavily granulated somatotroph subpopulation isolated by density gradient centrifugation; and 4) that high mol wt GH forms were released from the dense somatotrophs in culture, since treatment of the culture medium with beta-mercaptoethanol increased GH immunoassayability by about 5-fold. Taken together, the results show that high mol wt GH aggregates are contained in secretory granules of certain somatotrophs and are also released in aggregate form from these cells in vitro.\r"

In search of the earliest detectable stage of thyroid heterogeneity we have observed doubling times, TSH dependency, and thyroglobulin production in colonies formed from individual FRTL-5 cells growing as monolayers in slide flasks. Single cells and the colonies derived thereof were followed on photographs taken daily until confluence. We observed that each cell had its individual stable multiplication rate throughout the observation period. This was true for all TSH doses tested (0.625-10 mU/ml). A wide range of doubling times (20 h to almost infinite) in the individual cells was observed. The mean growth velocity of subcloned cell lines was highly reproducible in consecutive passages, although a minority of cells escaped this rule. Cells with either high or low thyroglobulin content occurred in clusters, indicating again that specific traits tend to remain stable in the offspring. We conclude that a highly individual growth program, unrelated to mutation, appears to be switched on at the very moment a cell is generated and that this program is passed on to the majority of the offspring, with a minority of cells acquiring qualities differing from those of their sister cell. Therefore, goiter heterogeneity may be the in vivo amplification of a natural phenomenon occurring in all growing cells. Monoclonal adenomas in vivo and nontransformed immortal cell lines in vitro may represent the far end of the large spectrum of individual growth potency among normal thyrocytes.\r"

In the presence of 15 mM glucose and 2.5 mM Ca2+, galanin (50 nM) and epinephrine (100 nM) hyperpolarized the B-cell membrane and suppressed electrical activity only transiently. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in 86Rb+ efflux from islet cells and nearly complete inhibition of insulin release. Both agents also decreased 86Rb+ efflux in the absence of Ca2+. Low concentrations (10-15 microM) of diazoxide, an activator of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, mimicked some effects of galanin and epinephrine. However, insulin release was more markedly inhibited by galanin or epinephrine than by diazoxide when electrical activity was similarly decreased, and diazoxide had no effect on 86Rb+ efflux in the absence of Ca2+. When the permeability to K+ was increased by 100 microM diazoxide and the hyperpolarization reversed by high extracellular K+, galanin and epinephrine still inhibited insulin release, but did not affect the membrane potential or 86Rb+ efflux. Galanin and epinephrine decreased glucose utilization and oxidation in islet cells by about 10%, whereas diazoxide had no effect. Blockade of alpha 2-adrenoceptors by yohimbine suppressed the effects of epinephrine, but not those of galanin. It is concluded that activation of galanin and alpha2-adrenergic receptors inhibits insulin release by the same mechanisms. These may involve an increase in K+ permeability of the B-cell membrane by opening ATP-sensitive K+ channels and an additional effect independent of the membrane potential.\r"

  ".U": "90168794\r", 
  ".W": "5'-Deiodination of T4 or rT3 in the presence of flavonoids was studied in freshly isolated suspended rat hepatocytes. Flavonoids, a novel group of synthetic deiodinase inhibitors, were designed to act as T4 antagonists. 5'-Deiodination of the prohormone T4 to the thyromimetically active T3 is an essential first step in controlling thyroid hormone action. Hepatocytes were incubated with either 2 microM T4 or 2 microM [125I]rT3 as 5'-deiodinase substrates in the absence and presence of inhibitors (0.1-100.0 microM). T3 production from T4 was determined by T3 RIA, and [125I]iodide release from [125I]rT3 was alternatively used as a technically more simple and rapid but sensitive deiodinase assay. Aurones and flavones inhibited both T4 5'-deiodination and rT3 5'-deiodination, with half-maximal inhibitor concentrations from 3-45 microM. Aurones were equally potent in both assays. 3-Methyl-flavones, designed as rT3 analogs, were more active by a factor of 3-5 with T4 5'-deiodination than with rT3 5'-deiodination, with the exception of one relatively cell-toxic compound. Hepatocyte viability was controlled by trypan blue dye exclusion as well as by measuring gluconeogenesis from exogenously added 10 mM lactate. Some of the flavonoids inhibited gluconeogenesis at concentrations that had no effect on trypan blue dye exclusion. Flavonoid inhibitors reduce 5'-deiodinase activity in intact hepatocytes in concentrations equimolar to those of substrates. Therefore, synthetic flavonoids may be suitable substances for further study of iodothyronine physiology or, after modification, could be useful as a new class of antiiodothyronine drugs.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a method of culturing intact porcine thyroid follicles for physiological de novo thyroid hormone formation; the roles of cAMP and protein kinase-C in thyroid hormone formation were also studied. Thyroid follicles were obtained by digesting minced porcine thyroid tissue with 0.04% collagenase and cultured in Coon's Modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.5% calf serum, 0.5 mU/ml TSH, other standard hormones, and 3 antibiotics (6H medium). On the fourth day of culture, 6000-8000 follicles/well were plated in 12-well culture dishes. On the sixth day, thyroid hormone formation was carried out by incubating thyroid follicles with 0.5 microM KI in the presence of 6H medium for 2 days in a 5% CO2-95% air incubator at 37 C. To examine the effects of cAMP and protein kinase-C on de novo thyroid hormone formation, follicles were incubated with KI in the presence of 1-2.5 mM (Bu)2cAMP, 10 microM forskolin, 2 microM prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), or 0.5-1 microM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in TSH-free medium for 2 days. The amount of newly formed thyroid hormone was measured by RIA of T3 content in the Pronase digest of thyroid follicular cells. Thyroid follicles cultured in 6H medium had normal polarity of the membrane, determined by electron microscope, and thyroid cAMP was responsive to the alteration of TSH. In this culture system cAMP alone was sufficient to form thyroid hormone. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a protein kinase-C stimulator, disrupted thyroid follicles and inhibited cAMP-mediated thyroid hormone formation. The integrity of follicular structure was also required for thyroid hormone formation in this culture system. This study introduces perhaps the most physiological culture system for de novo thyroid hormone formation. Our data provide direct evidence that thyroid hormone formation is linked to cAMP and that the protein kinase-C system acts as an inhibitor of thyroid hormone formation.\r"

  ".W": "The accumulation of iron or aluminum can cause metabolic bone disease, but the mechanisms by which these agents affect bone metabolism remain uncertain. Since transferrin (Tf) can bind several different metals in plasma, equilibrium radioligand binding studies were performed to identify and characterize the Tf receptor in UMR-106-01 osteoblast-like cells; the role of Tf as a modifier of metal-induced changes in cell proliferation was also examined. Osteoblast-like cells grown in serum-free medium have approximately 40,000 Tf receptors on the cell membrane. Tf receptor expression increases during iron depletion and decreases with iron supplementation; the number of Tf receptors was also inversely related to both cell density and the rate of cell proliferation in vitro. Physiological levels of unsaturated Tf (5 microM) enhanced DNA synthesis in osteoblast-like cells maintained in serum-free medium, as measured by the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA. Although neither 10 microM iron (Fe) nor 10 microM gallium (Ga), a known antiproliferative agent, altered DNA synthesis in UMR-106-01 cells during 48-h incubations in serum-free medium, both agents reduced the rate of DNA synthesis when added to serum-free medium containing 5 microM apo-Tf. Decreases in the incorporation of [3H] thymidine into DNA were also noted in osteoblast-like cells incubated for 48 h with 3 microM partially saturated iron Tf or gallium Tf. The results indicate that osteoblast-like cells have a single class of membrane receptors for Tf and that the regulation of Tf receptor expression in UMR-106-01 cells is similar to that in other cell types. The uptake of iron and gallium via the Tf-receptor complex can affect osteoblast proliferation, and such a mechanism may contribute to the bone cell toxicity of various metals.\r"

It was recently confirmed that immunoreactive VIP is present in the anterior pituitary, and in a thyroid-deficient state, VIP could be detected by light microscopic immunohistochemistry. It has also been suggested that VIP plays a stimulatory role in PRL secretion. To gain more detailed information on the localization of VIP and the conditions that alter the synthesis of VIP, we examined VIP immunoreactivity using immunohistochemistry in pituitaries of normal male and cycling female rats and in those states in which PRL secretion was enhanced (pregnancy, lactation, long term estrogen treatment, and pituitary implanted under kidney capsule of normal or estrogen-treated female rats). In situ, implanted and cultured pituitary cells were stained for VIP immunoreactivity using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. VIP immunoreactivity was observed in about 45% of the male rats, in all estrogen-treated female rats, in the implanted pituitaries under the kidney capsule (three of five from estrogen-treated and one of five from intact females, respectively), and in the pituitary cell cultures derived from estrogen-treated rats. Using a double labeling procedure we have also observed PRL immunoreactivity in a small population of the VIP-positive cells. These results suggest a positive regulatory role of estrogen in expression of the VIP gene. The physiological and pathophysiological significance of VIP in PRL secretion, however, remains to be clarified.\r"

The direct effects of an antiserum to bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and of recombinant bFGF on growth and tissue differentiation in the transplants were evaluated by infusing them into the right renal artery via a catheter attached to an osmotic minipump. Infusion of the antiserum into the right kidney of intact hosts for 6 or 10 days did not affect either growth of the paws or bone differentiation in them. By contrast, the anti-FGF serum significantly inhibited the growth of intestinal transplants and caused slight retardation of villus differentiation. We presume that this inhibition resulted from neutralization of the bFGF produced within the transplants, as infusion of nonimmune rabbit serum had no such effects on the intestinal segments. In hypophysectomized hosts growth of both types of transplants was greatly reduced, and tissue differentiation was retarded, presumably reflecting low serum insulin-like growth factor-I levels. Infusion of the recombinant bFGF (5 micrograms/rat.day) into the hypophysectomized hosts stimulated growth of the paws and promoted ossification of the phalanges, but not the carpals. Intestinal growth was not affected by bFGF, and villus development was not restored. These results indicate that fetal rat structures are differentially dependent on and responsive to bFGF for growth and differentiation. These findings, when considered in relation to our previous results with transplanted 10-day-old rat embryos, indicate that growth and tissue differentiation during the embryonic period of rat development are more dependent on bFGF than are these processes in the fetal period.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-RP) stimulates bone resorption is not known. Like certain other resorbing agents it may act to release bone-resorbing cytokines from the osteoblast. To examine this hypothesis, we used serum-free conditioned media (CM) from SAOS II cells incubated with 10(-8) M h(1-74) PTH-RP for 48 h. Treated CM contained substantially more bone-resorbing activity (BRA) in the fetal-rat long-bone assay than CM from untreated cells (2.17 +/- 0.21 vs 1.38 +/- 0.16 fold stimulation over basal [f]; p less than 0.05]. After centrifugation and dialysis, 1 liter of treated CM contained a total BRA of 7102 ngeq b(1-34) PTH with a specific activity (SA) of 447 ngeq b(1-34) PTH/mg protein. Treated CM did not stimulate the ROS assay and the cytokines PGE2, TGF-alpha, EGF, GM-CSF and IL-1 were present in low concentrations. The BRA was heat sensitive. Ultrafiltration revealed that 97% of the BRA was in a 3-30 kD fraction. Further purification was achieved by sequential reverse phase HPLC and size exclusion-HPLC (SE-HPLC). A single fraction containing BRA from SE-HPLC was purified 277-fold to a SA of 123,810 ngeq b(1-34) PTH/mg protein and had an apparent MW of 9 kD. SDS-PAGE revealed 4 bands in this SE-HPLC fraction with 1 band at 9 kD unique to that fraction. PTH-RP may cause bone resorption in part by stimulating the release of a 9 kD protein from osteoblasts which is responsible for activating osteoclasts.\r"

In this paper we present 77 consecutive patients with deep colorectal endometriosis treated with a full-thickness resection. Gynecologic procedures included conservative laparotomies for preserving fertility (39 patients); hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (29 patients); bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (2 patients); left salpingo-oophorectomy (1 patient) and resection of pelvic endometriosis in patients with previous ablative surgery (6 patients). A low anterior bowel resection was performed in 68 patients (88.3%); a disc excision of the anterior rectal wall in 5 (6.5%); sigmoid resection in 3 (3.9%), and partial cecal resection in 1 (1.3%). The postoperative febrile morbidity was 10.4%, with no apparent anastomotic leaks. Of 33 patients who attempted to conceive postoperatively, 13 achieved a term pregnancy (39.4%). Complete relief of pelvic symptoms was obtained in 38 patients (49.4%); improvement in 30 (39%); no improvement in 8 (10.4%); and worsening of symptoms in 1 (1.2%). There has been no recurrence of symptomatic bowel endometriosis during 1 to 9 years of follow-up. Full-thickness resection of the colon for the treatment of deep bowel endometriosis is a safe procedure with low morbidity, good postoperative relief of symptoms, and favorable pregnancy rates.\r"

Accordingly, we reviewed the preoperative HSGs performed on 54 women and the surgical findings of these and 27 additional patients who underwent laparoscopy and/or laparotomy for tubal anastomosis. The observation of interstitial, isthmic, and ampullary obstruction by HSG correctly correlated with surgical findings in 12%, 94%, and 69% of cases, respectively. The decision to perform an anastomosis was made in 14 of 17 (82.4%) tubes with interstitial obstruction, 45 of 51 (88.2%) tubes with isthmic occlusion, and 26 of 36 (72.2%) tubes with ampullary occlusion. When distal tubal occlusion was demonstrated by HSG (36/104 tubes, 34.6%), 10 had no repairable ampullary segments. The site of tubal occlusion on HSG was not predictive of a repairable tube. We conclude that the routine HSG is not warranted in the preoperative evaluation of candidates for tubal anastomosis.\r"

However, addition of RU486 or human relaxin had no effect on control, hCG-, or PGE2-stimulated P production. Thus, the receptor data are consistent with an autocrine action of P in luteinizing GCs, but initial experiments in cell culture did not define a role for P or relaxin in modulating luteal steroidogenesis.\r"

A control group (group I) consisted of 28 women (28 cycles) who received our standard ovulation induction regimen (no luteal phase support). The treatment group (group II) consisted of 40 women (42 cycles) who were prospectively studied after receiving luteal phase support with 10,000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 5 days after the initial hCG dose. The groups were matched for age and cause of infertility. Estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) were measured on the day of embryo transfer and every 3 to 4 days thereafter. Luteal phase hCG support significantly augmented (1) E2 and P levels in the conception cycles of group II compared with group I and (2) P levels in the nonconception cycles of group II compared with group I. The midluteal decline in E2 and P that was observed in group I was minimized or prevented in group II. An ongoing pregnancy rate of 19% was achieved in group II. This was not statistically different from the 13% ongoing pregnancy rate noted in a separate group of 163 tubal factor couples undergoing IVF after our standard ovulation induction regimen during the period of the study. In summary, the luteal phase hormone profiles of IVF cycles were improved by supplementation with hCG. It is concluded that this type of intervention may serve to rescue potentially failing corpora lutea and thereby optimize the peri-implantation hormonal milieu.\r"

Moreover short preincubation of washed sperm with FF improves sperm performance in the hamster egg penetration assay. In the current study, FF was used to capacitate sperm and as a transfer medium in 131 gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) procedures. Ham's F-10 medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) with 50% maternal serum was used in another 29 GIFT procedures. In the Ham's F-10 group, 29 GIFT procedures were performed in 25 patients with a pregnancy rate of 21% per laparoscopy and 24% per patient. In the FF group, 131 GIFT procedures were performed in 100 patients with a pregnancy rate of 50% per laparoscopy and 66% per patient, with a 59% ongoing pregnancy rate per patient. The most significant improvement was in the male factor group with a pregnancy rate of 0% in the Ham's F-10 group and 44% per procedure in the FF group. We conclude that the use of FF for sperm capacitation and as a gamete transfer medium significantly improves GIFT pregnancy rates and outcome.\r"

A total of 154 patients were randomized into alternating treatment cycles and underwent 238 cycles of IUI and 229 cycles of ICI. The pregnancy rate per treatment cycle was 9.7% following IUI and 3.9% following ICI. Treatment outcome was influenced by patient age, ovulatory status, and endometriosis. Pregnancy success correlated well with the post-thaw survival of sperm and the number of motile cells inseminated. In spite of having normal semen parameters, some donors were found to have markedly reduced sperm fecundity. We conclude that IUI with cryopreserved sperm can be an effective treatment for couples with infertility, genetic indications, or other reasons.\r"

Comparison of the protein patterns evidenced that CF-seminal plasma (CF-SP) mainly consisted of prostatic components. Although lactoferrin was undetectable in all samples, trace amounts of low molecular weight proteins were observed in two patients. This latter finding could imply that CF-SP may contain proteolytic fragments of prostatic and/or vesicular proteins or de novo synthesized components.\r"

In 26 patients with negative results, results became positive in 20 with human FF and the acrosome reaction increased fourfold. In 19 different men, we compared the results of the conventional and modified assays with outcome of in vitro fertilization.

The gel (1.5 mg E2) mixed with 7.5 x 10(5) cpm tritiated E2 (3H-E2) was applied to abdominal skin. Serial skin biopsies were taken from the application area and at 1 and 3 cm beyond, as well as from perineum and dorsal skin; and radioactivity measured to estimate tissue levels of E2 derived from percutaneous delivery. Simultaneous femoral serum samples were taken for RIA of E2. Skin 3H-E2 reached a peak at approximately 60 minutes, which was sustained for about 10 hours. Lateral diffusion of the radiolabeled E2 was limited to about 1 cm. Serum E2 levels reached a peak at 60 minutes and remained elevated for 20 hours after a single application. A strong correlation existed between skin and serum E2 levels: r = 0.828. DES did not modify the E2 skin absorption kinetics, but in 2 of 3 monkeys DES reduced the E2 serum levels, suggesting an effect after skin absorption. We conclude that percutaneously delivered E2 manifests a sustained entry into serum. The steady state of continuous release of E2 into circulation derives from a postabsorption skin reservoir of estrogen product.\r"

  ".W": "In situ perfusion of the fetal side of the anesthetized rat placenta was used to monitor glucose fluxes in nondiabetic, streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D), acutely hyperglycemic nondiabetic, and acutely normoglycemic STZ-D rats. STZ-D resulted in increased accumulation of glucose in the perfusate during a single passage through the fetal vasculature compared with nondiabetic rats, and this increase was maintained in normoglycemic STZ-D rats, indicating glucose release from placental stores. The fractional clearance of 3-O-[14C]methylglucose, a nonmetabolizable glucose analogue, across the placenta was decreased in both STZ-D groups compared with nondiabetic rats but unchanged in hyperglycemic nondiabetic rats, implying a reduction in glucose transporters in diabetic placentas. The difference between the transfer of D-[3H]glucose and 3-O-[14C]methylglucose indicated that 17% of the glucose was retained while traversing the placenta of nondiabetic rats, whereas a smaller percentage (8%) but a larger absolute amount (9 vs. 6 mumol/h) of glucose was retained by the placentas of the severely STZ-D rats. This retention was markedly enhanced in hyperglycemic nondiabetic rats and STZ-D rats when rendered normoglycemic. The net accumulation of perfusate glucose was less than that predicted from radiolabeled transfer data, indicating that glucose is also back transferred from the perfusate to the mother's placenta. We conclude that maternal diabetes markedly affects placental glucose flux.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the potential of myo-inositol-supplemented diets to prevent diabetes-induced vascular functional changes, we examined the effects of diets supplemented with 0.5, 1, or 2% myo-inositol on blood flow and vascular filtration function in nondiabetic control rats and rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes (STZ-D). After 1 mo of diabetes and dietary myo-inositol supplementation, 1) 131I-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) permeation of vessels was assessed in multiple tissues, 2) glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated as renal plasma clearance of 57Co-labeled EDTA, 3) regional blood flows were measured with 15-microns 85Sr-labeled microspheres, and 4) endogenous albumin and IgG urinary excretion rates were quantified by radial immunodiffusion assay. In STZ-D rats, 131I-BSA tissue clearance increased significantly (2- to 4-fold) in the anterior uvea, choroid-sclera, retina, sciatic nerve, aorta, new granulation tissue, diaphragm, and kidney but was unchanged in skin, forelimb muscle, and heart. myo-Inositol-supplemented diets reduced diabetes-induced increases in 131I-BSA clearance (in a dose-dependent manner) in all tissues; however, only in new granulation tissue and diaphragm did the 2% myo-inositol diet completely normalize vascular albumin permeation. Diabetes-induced increases in GFR and in urinary albumin and IgG excretion were also substantially reduced or normalized by dietary myo-inositol supplements. Increased blood flow in anterior uvea, choroid-sclera, kidney, new granulation tissue, and skeletal muscle in STZ-D rats also was substantially reduced or normalized by the 2% myo-inositol diet. myo-Inositol had minimal if any effects on the above parameters in control rats. These observations indicate that diabetes-induced increases in regional blood flow, 131I-BSA permeation, GFR, and urinary protein excretion can be markedly reduced or normalized by consumption of myo-inositol-supplemented diets that raise plasma myo-inositol levels approximately fivefold. The failure of the 2% myo-inositol diet to normalize GFR and blood flow and albumin permeation in several tissues despite markedly elevated plasma myo-inositol levels and normal or elevated tissue myo-inositol levels indicates that if vascular functional changes in these tissues are linked to altered myo-inositol levels, they are resistant to normalization by elevation of plasma myo-inositol levels. These results suggest that other factors independent of changes in relative or absolute tissue myo-inositol levels may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes-induced vascular functional changes in these tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

When zero-order kinetics were used to analyze the data, the percentage of double-stranded DNA (%dsDNA) unwinding in brain, liver, and intestinal epithelium of diabetic rats maintained for 4 wk was significantly reduced compared with vehicle-injected control rats (%dsDNA 0.37 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.73 +/- 0.02 for brain, 0.59 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.02 for liver, and 0.58 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.90 +/- 0.13 for intestinal epithelium). Insulin treatment of diabetic rats normalized the rate of DNA unwinding in liver (0.82 +/- 0.09 %dsDNA/min) and intestinal epithelium (1.05 +/- 0.09 %dsDNA/min), but the increase in the unwinding rate of brain DNA (0.51 +/- 0.06 %dsDNA/min) did not achieve control values. Similarly, alkali-induced DNA unwinding was significantly slower in brain and liver of db/db mice compared with homozygote controls. When first-order kinetics were used to analyze the data, fractional rate constants of DNA unwinding in brain and liver of diabetic rats or mice were significantly smaller than observed in nondiabetic control animals. The fractional rate constant of DNA unwinding in intestinal epithelium was not altered with diabetes. We conclude that chronic uncontrolled hyperglycemia can alter chromatin structure in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Microvascular disease is a hallmark of diabetes. Although the etiology of diabetic microangiopathy remains to be elucidated, numerous studies in experimental animals and human diabetic patients have suggested that a change in vascular reactivity to vasoactive agents is a component of the pathophysiology. Most previous studies have utilized indirect methods to study the microcirculation or have conducted studies of responses in large vessels. This study was designed to directly study in an intact microvascular preparation the effects of streptozocin-induced diabetes (STZ-D) on microvascular reactivity. The responses of arterioles in the cremaster muscle of pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized rats to topically applied norepinephrine were measured in STZ-D rats of 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 wk duration and in age-matched nondiabetic rats. Resting arteriolar diameters and mean arterial pressure were not affected by diabetes. In the STZ-D rats, larger (1A) arterioles were normally responsive after 2, 4, 8, and 16 wk of diabetes compared with nondiabetic rats. In contrast, the smaller 2A and 3A arterioles exhibited hypersensitivity to norepinephrine initially, but responses returned to normal sensitivity as the duration of diabetes progressed to the chronic stage. These results suggest that there are important functional changes in the responses of the microcirculation to norepinephrine that are associated with the development of diabetes and that these changes are anatomically specific and temporally dependent.\r"

Because omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (omega 3FA) intake has a potential protective effect on cardiovascular disease, we studied the influence of omega 3FA supplementation (5.4 g eicosapentaenoic acid and 2.3 g docosahexaenoic acid daily) for 4 wk in 13 well-controlled type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects on a vascular risk profile. Each subject served as his/her own control in a pre- and post-omega 3FA-intake phase. In plasma and platelets, phospholipids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid increased at the expense of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid. There was no significant change in blood pressure and glycosylated proteins. Only small changes were noted in blood glucose levels and insulin dose. Side effects were not noted. Triglycerides decreased significantly in the first 14 days, and total cholesterol increased slightly, probably because of an elevation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol remained unchanged. Platelet aggregation induced by low doses of ADP and collagen, which was higher in diabetic than nondiabetic subjects, decreased during omega 3FA intake to levels of healthy control subjects. Thromboxane production after ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation decreased significantly. Thromboxane liberation during clotting of whole blood and urinary excretion of thromboxane were markedly lowered during omega 3FA supplementation. The results show that even short-term intake of omega 3FAs leads to beneficial changes of vascular risk factors without significant changes in glucose homeostasis.\r"

We measured substrate oxidation and energy metabolism in 10 nonobese untreated NIDDM patients with fasting glucose levels of 7-8 mM with indirect calorimetry in the basal state and during an isoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (approximately 100 mU/L) clamp without (control) and with a concomitant infusion (approximately 0.35 mmol/min) of Intralipid, a triglyceride emulsion. In the control study, fasting rates of total glucose turnover [( 3-3H]glucose) and glucose and lipid oxidation (9.4 +/- 1.4, 7.3 +/- 1.3, and 3.0 +/- 0.4 mumol.kg-1.min-1, respectively) were comparable with those of nondiabetic individuals. After insulin administration, lipid oxidation was normally suppressed (to 1.3 +/- 0.3 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01), as were the circulating levels of FFA, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate, whereas glucose oxidation doubled (14.1 +/- 1.8 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01). Because glycemia was clamped at 7.5 mM, endogenous glucose production (EGP) was completely suppressed, and total glucose disposal was stimulated (to 25.7 +/- 5.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01 vs. baseline), but glucose clearance (3.6 +/- 0.8 ml.kg-1.min-1) was 30% reduced compared with normal. With concomitant lipid infusion, FFA, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate all rose during the clamp; correspondingly, lipid oxidation was maintained at fasting rates (3.6 +/- 0.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01 vs. control).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The prevalence of both impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) was investigated in 5080 Muslim and Hindu Indian, Creole (mixed African, European, and Indian origin), and Chinese Mauritian adults aged 25-74 yr who were selected by random cluster sampling. Based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and World Health Organization criteria, the age-standardized prevalence of IGT was significantly greater in women (19.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 18.1-21.2) than in men (11.7%, CI 10.5-12.8). By contrast, the prevalence of NIDDM was similar in men (12.1%, CI 10.9-13.4) and women (11.7%, CI 10.5-12.8) for all ethnic groups combined. The sex difference in IGT prevalence was seen in all ethnic groups, but for NIDDM, the sex difference was not consistent across ethnic groups. However, age- and sex-standardized prevalence of IGT and NIDDM was remarkably similar across ethnic groups (16.2 and 12.4% in Hindu Indians, 15.3 and 13.3% in Muslim Indians, 17.5 and 10.4% in Creoles, and 16.6 and 11.9% in Chinese, respectively). Three new cases of diabetes were diagnosed for every two known cases. The high prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance in Indian subjects is consistent with studies of other migrant Indian communities, but the findings in Creole and, in particular, Chinese subjects are unexpected. Potent environmental factors shared between ethnic groups in Mauritius may be responsible for the epidemic of glucose intolerance.\r"

There is also concern that alcohol-induced injury in other organs will preclude a good result. From July 1, 1982, to April 30, 1988, 73 patients received orthotopic liver transplants at the University of Pittsburgh for end-stage alcoholic liver disease. Fifty-two (71%) of these were alive at 25 +/- 9 mo (mean +/- S.D.) after transplantation, when a phone survey of these patients, their wives/husbands, and their physicians was performed to evaluate their subsequent use of alcohol, current medical condition and employment. Data obtained were compared with those for nonalcoholic patients selected as transplant controls. The recidivism rate has been 11.5%, with most patients drinking only socially. Fifty-four percent of the survivors are employed, 21% classify themselves as homemakers and only 11 (21%) are unable to work. Twenty-one patients died after transplantation; the most frequent cause of death was sepsis (43%), and intraoperative death was the next most common cause (28.6%). These data demonstrate that alcoholic patients can be transplanted successfully and achieve good health not significantly different from that of individuals transplanted for other causes. Thus orthotopic liver transplantation is a therapeutic option that should be considered for individuals with end-stage alcoholic liver disease who desire such therapy.\r"

The depletion was corrected with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (0.4 mg/kcal) administration (102.1 +/- 15.4 nmol/gm after S-adenosyl-L-methionine-ethanol, with 121.4 +/- 11.9 nmol/gm in controls). Ethanol also induced a depletion of glutathione (2.63 +/- 0.13 mumol/gm after ethanol vs. 4.87 +/- 0.36 mumol/gm in controls) that was attenuated by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (3.89 +/- 0.51 mumol/gm in S-adenosyl-L-methionine-methanol vs. 5.22 +/- 0.53 mumol/gm in S-adenosyl-L-methionine controls). There was a significant correlation between hepatic S-adenosyl-L-methionine and glutathione level (r = 0.497; p less than 0.01).

This attenuation by S-adenosyl-L-methionine of the ethanol-induced increase in plasma glutamic dehydrogenase (p less than 0.005) was associated with a decrease in the number of giant mitochondria (assessed in percutaneous liver biopsy specimens), with a corresponding change in the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial marker enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A high-fat diet has previously been shown to be a key factor for induction of alcoholic liver fibrosis in a rat model of intragastric ethanol infusion. To explore a possible mechanism by which the high-fat diet facilitated such an effect, the present study examined how the high-fat diet with or without ethanol affected proliferation and collagen formation of hepatic lipocytes, perisinusoidal cells that have been suggested to be involved in liver fibrogenesis. We also evaluated effects of the high-fat diet on the sensitivity of lipocytes to stimulatory effects of Kupffer cell-derived factors. Intragastric infusion of ethanol and the high-fat diet for 9 to 10 wk resulted in induction of a varying degree of perivenular fibrosis in 75% of animals. Lipocytes isolated from these animals (A) had significantly higher basal rates of proliferation (three to four times) and collagen formation (1.5 times) than those isolated from control animals, which were isocalorically infused with the high-fat diet (H) or the low-fat diet (L), or those that were fed chow ad libitum (C). Lipocytes from the H group exhibited significantly higher relative production of collagen than those from the L group, but their net collagen production was not enhanced. The dialyzed Kupffer cell-conditioned medium from the A group markedly stimulated proliferation and collagen formation of lipocytes from the groups given the high-fat diet (A and H) but had minimal effects on those from the L and C groups, establishing the order of decreasing lipocyte sensitivity from the A, H, L to C group. Similarly, lipocytes from the H and A groups exhibited a more profound responsiveness to the stimulatory effect of transforming growth factor beta 1 on collagen formation. These results demonstrate (a) that lipocytes isolated from the rats given the high-fat diet and ethanol are markedly proliferative and produce more collagen; and (b) that the Kupffer cells derived from these animals release factors that stimulate proliferation and collagen formation of lipocytes and (c) that the high-fat diet sensitizes lipocytes for stimulatory effects of the Kupffer cell-derived factors and transforming growth factor beta 1.\r"

  ".W": "Although administration of 100 mg galactosamine caused severe hepatic injury in C3H/HeN mice, splenectomy reduced the grade of this hepatotoxicity. However, this hepatic injury was scarcely detected in the endotoxin-resistant C3H/HeJ mice. In addition, in contrast to high lethality in C3H/HeN mice with a combined administration of galactosamine and endotoxin, splenectomy rendered C3H/HeN mice slightly resistant to this treatment. Further resistance was demonstrated in C3H/HeJ mice. In an attempt to clarify the role of endotoxin-responsive spleen cells in the pathogenesis of hepatic injury, we investigated galactosamine-induced hepatic injury by transfer of lipopolysaccharide-treated C3H/HeN or C3H/HeJ spleen cells. Both oxygen-derived free radical production and the proportion of macrophages in spleen cells were markedly enhanced in C3H/HeN mice after an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide. Further increase in oxidative free radical production was found in the dish-adherent cells (macrophages). These enhancements were not demonstrated in lipopolysaccharide-treated C3H/HeJ spleen cells. Although hepatic injury was not demonstrated in both C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice treated with 35 mg galactosamine alone, severe hepatotoxicity was found in these galactosamine-treated mice when they received lipopolysaccharide-activated C3H/HeN spleen cells, especially macrophages. Simultaneous administration of superoxide dismutase with the activated spleen cells reduced the grade of hepatic injury. On the other hand, hepatic injury was not demonstrated in the galactosamine-treated C3H/HeN or C3H/HeJ mice when they received lipopolysaccharide-treated C3H/HeJ spleen cells, although 3H-galactosamine incorporation into hepatocytes was nearly identical in both C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice. These results suggest that oxidative free radicals of lipopolysaccharide-responsive macrophages could contribute to the pathogenesis of galactosamine-induced hepatic injury.\r"

Kupffer cells and endothelial cells had similar high levels of deacetylase activity that were more than twice the level observed in fibroblasts. In contrast, hepatocytes had extremely low activity (several hundredfold less than Kupffer cells and endothelial cells). A major implication of deacetylase deficiency in hepatocytes is that N-acetylglucosamine generated as a result of the catabolism of complex carbohydrates in these cells cannot enter glycolysis and must be largely reused for the synthesis of plasma glycoproteins and other N-acetylglucosamine-containing macromolecules.\r"

In three of the eight cirrhotic patients, two were in the late stage of the disease (stage III) and concanavalin A-induced suppressor cell function was markedly decreased; it returned to normal levels after 1 mo of treatment consisting of 5 mg per week of orally administered colchicine. The relative percentage of T cell subsets (CD3, CD4 and CD8) and the mean percentage of the helper and the suppressor phenotype were similar in cirrhotic patients and in controls. Basal production of interleukin-1 activity by a monocyte-enriched fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of cirrhotic patients was three-fold above control values: after stimulation with endotoxin, interleukin-1 values increased tenfold above basal levels in monocyte-enriched fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of both normal and cirrhotic patients. Colchicine normalized the basal production of interleukin-1 and inhibited its stimulation by endotoxin by 50%. Culture supernatants of endotoxin-stimulated monocyte-enriched fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased the proliferation of cultured human skin fibroblasts by 50%. In contrast, supernatants from stimulated monocyte-enriched fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from colchicine-treated patients significantly inhibited fibroblast proliferation. These findings suggest that stimulated chronic inflammatory cells may play an important role in liver fibrosis. Some of the actions of colchicine could be related to its effects on lymphocyte and monocyte function.\r"

  ".W": "Recent work has shown that colchicine may benefit patients with primary biliary or alcoholic cirrhosis. However, very little is known about its pharmacokinetics in the presence of impaired liver function. To study this we examined the effects of three models of experimental liver dysfunction and one of cytochrome P-450 inhibition on colchicine elimination in the rat. The models of experimental liver dysfunction included bile duct ligation (with sham-operated controls), alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate-induced intrahepatic cholestasis and galactosamine-induced diffuse hepatocellular necrosis. The control group had a colchicine clearance of 77.33 ml/min.kg +/- 8.27 ml/min.kg, a half-life of 16.68 min +/- 0.97 min and a volume of distribution of 1.84 L/kg +/- 0.15 L/kg. Cimetidine administration, 120 mg/kg intraperitoneally 15 min before colchicine administration, caused clearance to decrease by 32% (p less than 0.05) and half-life to increase by 38% (p less than 0.05). Volume of distribution did not change. At 48 hr after bile duct ligation, colchicine clearance decreased by 84% (p less than 0.05), terminal half-life increased to 513.7 min +/- 106.6 min (p less than 0.05) and volume of distribution increased by 175% (p less than 0.05). Colchicine pharmacokinetics in sham-operated rats were not statistically different from the above mentioned controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Catalytically active human and rat liver S-adenosylmethionine synthetase exists mainly in tetramer and dimer form. In liver biopsy samples from cirrhotic patients a marked reduction in total S-adenosylmethionine synthetase activity and a specific loss of the tetrameric form of the enzyme exist. We have investigated the possible role of sulfhydryl groups in maintaining the structure and activity of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase. Both forms of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase are rapidly inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide, and the loss of enzyme activity correlates with the incorporation of approximately 2 moles N-ethylmaleimide per mole of subunit. In addition, reaction with N-ethylmaleimide resulted in displacement of the tetramer-dimer equilibrium of the enzyme toward the dimer, but no monomer was detected under these conditions. A catalytically active monomeric S-adenosylmethionine synthetase was detected in the cytosolic extract from a liver biopsy sample from a cirrhotic patient, supporting our model for the structure of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase. Because treatment of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase with N-ethylmaleimide resembles the situation of this enzyme in cirrhotic patients, it is proposed that impaired protection of the enzyme from oxidizing agents caused by a decreased synthesis of glutathione can explain the diminished synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine in liver cirrhosis.\r"

Taking part in the study were 28 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Twenty patients (group 1) had hemodynamic measurements in baseline conditions after beta-blockade by intravenous administration of propranolol and after receiving oral doses of isosorbide-5-mononitrate. The remaining eight patients (group 2) were given oral isosorbide-5-mononitrate while receiving chronic propranolol therapy. In group 1, propranolol significantly reduced portal pressure (estimated as the gradient between wedged and free hepatic venous pressures) from 21.5 +/- 3.9 to 18.6 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (-13.7%, p less than 0.001), azygos blood flow (-38%, p less than 0.001), hepatic blood flow (-12.8%, p less than 0.05), cardiac output (-24.5%, p less than 0.001) and heart rate (-18.4%, p less than 0.001) without significant changes in mean arterial pressure. Addition of oral isosorbide-5-mononitrate caused a further and marked fall in portal pressure (to 15.7 +/- 3.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), without additional changes in azygos blood flow but with significant additional reductions in hepatic blood flow (-15.5%, p less than 0.05), cardiac output (-11.5%, p less than 0.001) and mean arterial pressure (-22%, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, these drugs lower arterial pressure and are well known to induce tolerance. The aim of the present study was to assess the hemodynamic effects of molsidomine, an antianginal agent, which does not induce tolerance and has little effect on arterial pressure in patients with normal liver, in 13 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Wedged hepatic vein pressure (-11%, p less than 0.01), portohepatic venous pressure gradient (-15%, p less than 0.005), hepatic blood flow (-17.4%, p less than 0.005), mean arterial pressure (-13.5%, p less than 0.01) and cardiac output (-17%, p less than 0.001) were significantly reduced by molsidomine. Free hepatic vein pressure, intrinsic hepatic clearance indocyanine green, heart rate and systemic vascular resistances were not significantly modified. There was no correlation between the decrease in portohepatic venous pressure gradient and the reduction in mean arterial pressure on one hand and the decrease in cardiac output on the other hand. We therefore conclude that in patients with cirrhosis, molsidomine has effects similar to nitrates on systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics.\r"

Reduction of extracellular osmolarity by 80 mOsm/L leads to a release of potassium and a sustained alkalinization of effluent. Reexposure to isotonic perfusate leads to reuptake of potassium by the liver and acidification of effluent. Part of the alkalinization could be due to release of bicarbonate parallel to potassium release. Carboanhydrase inhibition and replacement of bicarbonate/CO2 by HEPES buffer, however, do not significantly modify volume regulatory potassium release or reuptake. Reduction of perfusate chloride to 37 mmol/L by replacement of NaCl with raffinose leads to a decrease of liver weight indicative of shrinkage of liver cells. Subsequent omission of 180 mmol/L raffinose leads to potassium and chloride release and to alkalinization of effluent. Volume regulatory release of potassium is impaired in 1 mmol/L quinidine, 1 mmol/L SITS and 5 mmol/L barium. Volume regulatory reuptake of potassium is impaired by 1 mmol/L amiloride. Volume regulatory release of potassium is not appreciably affected by either; 1 mmol/L furosemide, 1 mumol/L verapamil, 1 mmol/L amiloride or 1 mmol/L barium and volume regulatory potassium reuptake proved insensitive to 1 mmol/L furosemide or 1 mmol/L barium. The data suggest that the cells release potassium and chloride during regulatory volume decrease by quinidine, SITS and weakly barium-sensitive transport systems and that regulatory volume increase is accomplished by activation of Na/H exchange.\r"

Occurrence rates and amounts of three so-called unusual trihydroxy bile acids, hyocholate, ursocholate and omega-muricholate, were increased in patients treated with chenodeoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate or rifampicin and decreased in cirrhotic patients as compared with those in untreated healthy adults. These data suggest that chenodeoxycholate and ursodeoxycholate are hydroxylated to produce unusual trihydroxy bile acids in bile acid-loaded humans and that this metabolism may be related to the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes by rifampicin. In contrast, the hydroxylation of chenodeoxycholate and ursodeoxycholate may be impaired by severe hepatic damage. Because the urine is a secretory pathway for internal bile acids, the occurrence of unusual trihydroxy bile acids in the urine may be used as an indicator of hepatic ability to metabolize \"hydrophobic\" dihydroxy bile acids to their secretory forms.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of cholecystokinin and the cholinergic system in intestinal stimulation of gallbladder contraction, we studied the effects of atropine on plasma cholecystokinin and gallbladder contraction in six healthy volunteers (four men and two women aged 20 to 27 yr). Effects were noted after intraduodenal fat instillation and after dosage with exogenous cholecystokinin inducing plasma cholecystokinin concentrations similar to those after intraduodenal fat instillation. At regular intervals before and after administration of each stimulus, plasma cholecystokinin concentrations and gallbladder volumes were measured by radioimmunoassay and real-time ultrasonography, respectively. Intraduodenal infusion of 250 ml 20% Intralipid induced a peak plasma cholecystokinin increment of 10.2 +/- 1.6 pmol/L compared with 10.7 +/- 0.7 pmol/L during infusion of 1 Ivy dog unit per kilogram per hour of cholecystokinin. The increases in plasma cholecystokinin after fat and exogenous cholecystokinin administration were accompanied by similar decreases in gallbladder volume. Integrated gallbladder contraction after fat instillation was 3,939% +/- 288%.min compared with 3,301% +/- 359%.min during cholecystokinin infusion (NS). Atropine (0.015 mg/kg as bolus followed by 0.005 mg/kg/hr) did not change plasma cholecystokinin concentrations but induced similar inhibition of gallbladder contraction to 2,296% +/- 511%.min (p less than 0.05) after intraduodenal fat instillation and to 1,756% +/- 456%.min (p less than 0.05) during cholecystokinin infusion. We conclude that cholecystokinin is of major importance in intestinal stimulation of gallbladder contraction. Atropine inhibits the gallbladder response to intraduodenal fat. This inhibition is not due to a reduction in cholecystokinin secretion but to a diminished gallbladder response to cholecystokinin.\r"

This prediction is exemplified by studies of a chronic carrier of HBsAg/adw2, who lacked anti-HBc but carried exceedingly high levels of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum. Molecular characterization of a number of clones revealed a restriction map that deviated significantly from the typical pattern of the adw2 subtype, especially around the EcoRI site commonly used as a reference point. Mutations appearing consistently in the precore and core regions included (a) mutation in the precore region resulting in a termination codon after the initiation codon, (b) mutation of the core initiation codon and (c) an inframe insert of 36 nucleotides in the precore region with a new initiation site for the core protein. The 36-nucleotide insertion resulted in a new core protein with 12 extra amino acids at its amino-terminal end. A few scattered point mutations were clustered in the amino-terminal half of the core gene. Although the core protein of this hepatitis B virus variant carried immunologically detectable HBcAg, the absence of a humoral immune response to HBcAg could have been caused by previous infection with human immunodeficiency virus. This naturally occurring human hepatitis B virus variant replicated efficiently without expressing the precore region, confirming previous observations made of the artificial mutants of duck hepatitis B virus.\r"

The nucleator method, a new stereological approach, provided an efficient, unbiased estimate of mean cell volume in focal lesions and extrafocal areas. It also provided an unbiased sample of cells to estimate hepatocyte nuclear volume and the percentage of binucleated cells. The results showed an increase in the mean volume of mononucleated cells--from 4,700 micron3 in extrafocal areas to 12,700 micron2 in foci--and of binucleated cells--from 6,900 micron3 to 25,000 micron3. This demonstrated the hypertrophic effect of the carcinogenic treatment in focal lesions. A striking reduction in the proportion of binucleated cells was also observed in the preneoplastic lesions. Nuclear volume measurements from mononucleated and binucleated hepatocytes were used to assess ploidy. An apparent increase in nuclear ploidy, with no change in cellular ploidy, was noted in focal tissue when compared with nonfocal tissue. This appeared to be caused by an increase in mononucleated tetraploid cells and a reduction in binucleated cells with two diploid nuclei, indicating an altered mitotic mechanism in focal lesions. The significance of these changes in cell volume, apparent ploidy levels and binuclearity in preneoplastic foci is discussed in relation to the hepatocarcinogenic process.\r"

None of the patients had historical or clinical evidence of endocrine dysfunction. Their mean serum hormone levels were also within the expected ranges, but several differences were noted compared to those of seronegative controls. Basal cortisol, basal aldosterone, and ACTH-stimulated cortisol were significantly lower in the HIV group. One subject (2.5%) had a subnormal cortisol response, and two (5%) had abnormal aldosterone responses to ACTH. PRA tended to be higher, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels somewhat lower in the HIV group. Serum free testosterone was markedly elevated in the HIV patients and was associated with an exaggerated LH response to GnRH, but PRL, estradiol, and basal and peak GnRH-stimulated FSH did not differ between groups. Three subjects (8%) had subclinical hypothyroidism. Serum thyroid hormone levels were normal, but basal T3 was lower in the HIV group compared to control values. While of little immediate clinical importance, many subtle endocrine aberrations are evident very early in the course of HIV infection. These findings obtained in HIV-seropositive subjects without infections or tumors and who were not receiving medical therapy suggest an effect of HIV on each of the endocrine systems examined.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether frank or subtle disorders of adrenal steroidogenesis exist in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children, the adrenal steroid response to an iv bolus of ACTH-(1-24) (0.25 mg Cortrosyn) was determined. Ten children (six males and four females, aged 7 months to 7.5 yr) were studied. Five underwent repeat testing 3-5 months after initial assessment. Nine patients were classified as P2 or symptomatic according to the Center for Disease Control criteria for HIV infection in children. Eight had failure to thrive, six had opportunistic infections and neurological deficits, and two were receiving ketoconazole at the time of ACTH testing. Only one patient had a neonatally acquired transfusion-related HIV infection. Three of the children died 2-5 months after ACTH testing. All patients had normal or slightly elevated baseline and stimulated cortisol levels compared to the control population. The mean post-ACTH cortisol level was significantly higher than the mean post-ACTH level in the control population. No patient demonstrated an impaired aldosterone response to ACTH. The basal and ACTH-stimulated dehydroepiandrosterone levels were normal. Although individual deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone levels were variable, the mean stimulated deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone levels in the patients were suggestive of a selective defect of the 17-desoxy pathway in the adrenal fasciculata. No changes were noted in the patients' cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and aldosterone responses on repeat ACTH testing. In HIV-infected children we have demonstrated that cortisol and aldosterone synthesis is intact. Thus, the chronic debilitation observed cannot be explained on the basis of adrenal insufficiency. However, a selective deficiency of 17-desoxysteroid hormone production from the adrenal fasciculata may be present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, we measured serum immunoreactive inhibin levels in monkeys before and after luteectomy as well as immunoreactive inhibin concentrations and mRNA encoding the alpha-inhibin subunit in luteal tissue. Monkeys were assigned to one of four groups depending on which day of the luteal phase luteectomy was performed: group A, days 4-5; group B, days 7-8; group C, days 9-10; and group D, days 11-12 (the day after the estrogen surge = day 1 of the luteal phase). Daily blood samples were obtained for 3 days before luteectomy, immediately before surgery, and for 2 days after luteectomy. Immunoreactive inhibin concentrations were measured with a double antibody RIA using an antiserum to bovine 31-kDa inhibin, bovine 31-kDa inhibin for iodination, and a human follicular fluid inhibin preparation as standard. Total RNA was isolated from luteal tissue and transferred by Northern blot onto a Zeta-probe membrane. The probe used for hybridization was the PstI/NcoI restriction enzyme fragment (381 basepairs) of alpha-inhibin DNA generated from a human ovarian cDNA library. Serum inhibin concentrations decreased (P less than 0.05) 24 h after removal of the corpus luteum in each of the four groups studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We incubated dilute sera from seven active acromegalics (basal immunoreactive hGH, 22-313 micrograms/L) with rat adipocyte plasma membranes adsorbed on polystyrene plates. IgGs that bound to GH receptor sites in the absence and presence of 250 nM hGH (for nonspecific binding) were detected using anti-hIgG (Fc-specific) antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. In this system two of the seven sera studied tested positive for IgGs against GH-binding sites (serum 4 in 1:400 dilution, and serum 7 in 1:10 dilution). We studied further the serum with the highest titer. On Sephadex G-100, most of the GH-like immunoreactivity (assayed by RIA) present in serum 4 coeluted with IgGs (assayed by immunodiffusion) as a high mol wt (greater than or equal to 150 kDa) component. To confirm its IgG nature, this material was then adsorbed on protein-A-Sepharose and eluted with 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 3.0. The protein-A-purified IgGs from serum 4 bound specifically to GH receptor sites in adipocyte membranes and displaced [125I]hGH in the hGH RIA. In contrast, IgGs purified from another acromegalic patient (313 micrograms/L hGH) repeatedly tested negative in the membrane binding assay and hGH RIA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The relationship of these binding proteins (BPs) to the two serum BP-IGF complexes of 150 and 40 kD and their relationship to the two purified and well characterized IGF-BPs, BP-25 and BP-53, are not clear. The studies reported here used gel filtration, Western ligand blotting, deglycosylation, affinity cross-linking, and immunoprecipitation with antisera against BP-25 and BP-53 to explore the relationship among these IGF-BP forms. Serum from children with chronic renal failure was used for this study, since, by Western ligand blot, it was rich in all five IGF-BPs. The 28- and 33-kD BPs, which were hard to detect in normal serum, were elevated in chronic renal failure serum. Using this serum in each experiment, it was found that the large (150-kD) BP-IGF complex contained only the 41.5- and 38-kD BPs. Both of these BPs were precipitated by anti-BP-53 antiserum, but not by anti-BP-25 antisera, and both BPs were deglycosylated by endoglycosidase-F to a single 31-kD protein which retained the ability to bind IGF-I. This molecular mass of 31 kD is similar to the 28.7-kD mass for nonglycosylated BP-53 predicted by cDNA sequence analysis. In contrast, the 33-, 28-, and 23-kD BPs were only detected in the small (40-kD) BP-IGF complex. None of the three BPs was precipitated by anti-BP-53 antiserum, and none was digested by endoglycosidase-F. The 28-kD BP comigrated with pure BP-25 under all conditions and was precipitated by two independent anti-BP-25 antisera. The 33-kD BP was also precipitated by both anti-BP-25 antisera, while the 23-kD BP was not precipitated by any of the antisera tested. Thus, BP-53 consists of a core protein of 28.7 kD which is differentially glycosylated in serum to form two BPs of 41.5 and 38 kD; these BPs circulate exclusively as part of the large BP-IGF complex. BP-25 circulates in the small BP-IGF complex as a nonglycosylated protein with an apparent mol wt of 28 kD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The clinical and hormonal effects of each type of treatment were evaluated. Before treatment, the clinical and hormonal profiles of the two patient groups did not differ significantly. Excellent clinical evolution in terms of the regression of hirsutism was observed in the CPA-treated patients (54% decrease in the clinical score in 1 yr), in contrast with the slight decrease in hirsutism (26%) after hydrocortisone treatment. In hydrocortisone-treated patients, plasma androgen decreased to normal levels: testosterone from 3.05 +/- 1.45 to 1.46 +/- 0.42 nmol/L and delta 4-androstenedione from 13.6 +/- 4.1 to 6.33 +/- 1.47 nmol/L. Conversely, in CPA-treated patients, only a slight decrease in testosterone from 2.98 +/- 1.98 to 2.29 +/- 0.64 nmol/L and in delta 4-androstenedione from 12.9 +/- 5.9 to 9.86 +/- 2.23 nmol/L was observed. This slight decrease in plasma androgens contrasts with the rapid clinical improvement after CPA. These results emphasize the importance of peripheral receptivity to androgens in the clinical expression of hyperandrogenism. Moreover, they indicate that peripheral antiandrogen therapy may be more appropriate in late-onset adrenal hyperplasia patients than conventional adrenal inhibition using cortisone therapy.\r"

Confluent cultures treated with retinoic acid accumulated less [3H]GAG than those without the compound, an effect with an apparent threshold of 10 nM which was dose dependent in the concentration range tested (0-10 microM). At 10 microM, the inhibition was 54%. Greater than 80% of the labeled macromolecular material was streptomyces hyaluronidase digestible in cultures labeled with [3H]acetate. The incorporation of H2[35S]O4 into chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate was unaffected, as was total protein synthesis. Retinol also inhibited accumulation of [3H]GAG, but was far less potent. T3 and dexamethasone can inhibit [3H]hyaluronate synthesis. When retinoic acid was added to cultures treated with either of these hormones at concentrations that maximally inhibit [3H] GAG accumulation, there was a further decrease in the rate of macromolecular accumulation. The retinoic acid effect evolved over 24-48 h after addition to the culture medium. A pulse-chase study failed to demonstrate any effect on [3H]GAG degradation.\r"

  ".U": "90171180\r", 
  ".W": "The binding characteristics of several somatostatin (SS-14) analogs developed in our laboratory were examined in various human and animal tumors and normal tissues. In rat cerebral cortex and human breast cancer membranes the interaction of SS-14 with its binding sites was rapid, specific, saturable, linear with protein concentrations, and dependent on time and temperature. Analysis of kinetic and equilibrium experimental data showed that the interaction of [125I-Tyr11]SS-14 with the binding sites in all normal and tumoral tissue specimens was consistent with the presence of a single class of noncooperative binding sites. Superactive octapeptide analogs of somatostatin-containing hexapeptide sequences Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys or Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys showed significant binding affinities to SS-14 receptors. Among these analogs, D-Trp-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-NH2 (RC-98-I) showed the highest binding affinity to normal human pancreatic tissue and human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In contrast, Sandostatin (SMS 201-995) bound only to normal pancreas, not to human pancreatic cancers. Analog RC-98-I also showed a high binding to human and rat prostate cancers. In human epithelial ovarian cancers and an arrhenoblastoma, analogs D-Phe-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Trp-NH2 (RC-95-I), D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Thr-NH2 (RC-121) and D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Trp-NH2 (RC-160) appeared to be the most potent in displacing labeled SS-14. Analogs Ac-Phe-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-NH2 (RC-101-I) as well as RC-121, RC-160, and RC-95-I, but not SMS-201-995, showed high binding affinity in human breast cancers. In specimens of human meningioma the highest binding was found with analogs RC-121, RC-95-I, and RC-101-I. Since marked variations in binding affinities were noted for several analogs in the tissues of origin and the tumors, this suggest that differences may exist between somatostatin receptors not only in normal vs. cancerous tissues, but also among various tumors. Our findings also imply that some analogs could be therapeutically superior to others in the treatment of certain tumors.\r"

IPS dose-dependently increased plasma ACTH concentrations from -78 +/- 63 to 614 +/- 250 pmol.min/L (P less than 0.01) and plasma cortisol concentrations from -10.8 +/- 2.9 x 10(3) to 21.3 +/- 8.2 x 10(3) nmol.min/L (P less than 0.01) at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg in six men. The nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonist metergoline which acts at both 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors partially blocked the HPA response to IPS in six women and three men. The mean maximal integrated ACTH response decreased from 746 +/- 297 to 40 +/- 146 pmol/min.L (P less than 0.05), and the increase in cortisol was attenuated from 22.9 +/- 9.9 x 10(3) to 11.9 +/- 6.3 x 10(3) nmol.min/L (P less than 0.05). The nonselective beta-adrenergic and selective 5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist (+/-)pindolol was without effect on basal HPA activity, but completely antagonized the IPS-induced plasma ACTH and cortisol responses. The mean maximal integrated ACTH response decreased to 8.0 +/- 78 pmol.min/L (P less than 0.05), and the cortisol response was reduced to -2.3 +/- 6.5 x 10(3) nmol.min/L (P less than 0.05).

Such findings clearly establish that treatment duration has a direct beneficial incidence on the remission rate. These results were confirmed by the fact that treatment for 18 months resulted in remission in 7 of 15 patients who had previously relapsed after a 6-month course of therapy. This improvement in relation to treatment duration might be due to the immunosuppressive action of carbimazole. No significant difference was observed between relapse and remission groups, regardless of treatment duration, for HLA ABDr, serum T3 and T4, and T3/T4 ratio determined before treatment. Only the thyroid-stimulating antibody levels determined at the time of diagnosis and at the end of treatment were higher in the relapse group, a difference that was relevant only globally, due to value scattering. Furthermore, thyroid-stimulating antibody levels at the end of treatment may indicate remission or, conversely, continuance of the pathological process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In our previous description of the circulating GH-binding protein (GH-BP) we observed, in addition to the main GH-BP complex, a second macromolecular component designated peak I during gel filtration of [125I]GH-plasma mixtures. This component was not further characterized because of its small magnitude, seeming nonsaturability, and suspected artifactual nature. We have now characterized peak I as the complex of a low affinity BP with GH. To gain a better knowledge of the nature of peak I, whole plasma or plasma fractions containing isolated peak I-BP (ammonium sulfate precipitated or prepared by gel filtration of plasma) were incubated with monomeric [125I]GH and varying concentrations of unlabeled GH. The mixtures were then analyzed by Sephadex G-100 chromatography to separate free from protein-bound GH. Peak I-associated radioactivity was saturable at high concentrations of human GH, but not with animal GHs. Saturation/Scatchard analysis yielded an association constant of 10(5) M-1 and a maximum binding capacity of 15 mg/L plasma. Chemically cross-linked complexes of [125I]GH with isolated peak I BP were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and two-dimensional electrophoresis. These experiments yielded a mol wt of 124 kD and a pI of 7 for the cross-linked complex. This is in contradistinction to the previously reported high affinity GH-BP complex, which when cross-linked has a mol wt of 76 kD and a pI of 5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two complementary approaches were used: Southern blot analysis to examine the large scale organization of the gene, and a solution hybridization, nuclease protection assay to identify small alterations, such as point mutations. From a total of 61 subjects studied, 52 had no organic basis for their short stature. Analysis of chromosomal DNA from these individuals failed to reveal any variation in the IGF-I gene except for a HindIII site polymorphism which maps near the 3' end of the last IGF-I exon. No single nucleotide substitutions were found within IGF-I-coding regions. Since the frequency of the length polymorphism was the same for both normal-sized and short individuals, it is unlikely to be associated with growth abnormalities. Our results suggest that there is minimal DNA sequence variability in the human IGF-I gene and that mutations in IGF-I exons are infrequent causes of growth failure.\r"

To assess the mechanism of this phenomenon in the human fetus, metabolism of pregnenolone and corticosterone by second trimester human fetal adrenal definitive zone and fetal zone tissue was studied. After incubation of fresh tissue with trace amounts of [3H]pregnenolone or [3H]corticosterone, the products of metabolism were separated using high performance liquid chromatography and quantified. The delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids 17-hydroxypregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone and their sulfates comprised 85-90% of metabolized pregnenolone. In the fetal zone, cortisol was the predominant secreted delta 4-3-ketosteroid, accounting for 6-8% of the metabolized pregnenolone. In the definitive zone, progesterone and corticosterone were the predominant secreted delta 4-3-ketosteroids, each accounting for about 2% of the metabolized pregnenolone. 11-Dehydrocorticosterone and sulfates were the only metabolites detected after incubation of fetal adrenal tissue with corticosterone. 11-Dehydrocorticosterone accounted for more than 80% of the metabolized corticosterone in the definitive zone and 50% in the fetal zone. Incubations with secretagogues or antioxidants (10 nmol/L ACTH, 10 nmol/L angiotensin-II, 21 mmol/L potassium, 100 mmol/L dimethylsulfoxide, 5 mumol/L metyrapone, or 100 mumol/L butylated hydroxyanisole) did not change the pattern or extent of precursor metabolism. No aldosterone, 18-hydroxycorticosterone, or 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone was detected in baseline or stimulated incubations of human fetal tissue. In contrast, adult human zona glomerulosa metabolized corticosterone to aldosterone, 18-hydroxycorticosterone, and 11-dehydrocorticosterone under similar conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DER and QCT measurements were obtained in 56 healthy (H) and 48 fractured osteoporotic (OP) women using a Hologic QDR 1000 bone densitometer and a GE 9800 scanner, respectively. DER was significantly correlated with QCT in both the H (r = 0.75; P less than 0.0001) and the OP subjects (r = 0.58; P less than 0.0001). DER decreased significantly with age in the H (P less than 0.05), but not in the OP women, whereas QCT was related to age in both the H (P less than 0.0001) and the OP subjects (P less than 0.01). The rate of bone loss with age was also higher with QCT than with DER in both normal and osteoporotic women. The difference in bone density between the H and the OP subjects was larger (P less than 0.05) with QCT than with DER. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that QCT was a better predictor of vertebral fractures than DER. A larger percentage of OP subjects were 2 SD or more below the normal predicted value with QCT (41%) than with DER (29%). Furthermore, the slopes of the regressions of bone density with age for normal and osteoporotic women were significantly different (P less than 0.05) with QCT but not with DER. These findings are consistent with a disproportionate loss of trabecular bone with age in osteoporosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Physical fitness and muscle strength are important determinants of bone density, and the age-related decline in bone density may be related in part to a decline in fitness and muscle strength. Also, Sm-C has been shown to stimulate osteoblasts in vitro and may effect skeletal muscle mass. We postulated that the age-related decline in GH and Sm-C levels may be related to an age-related decline in physical fitness and/or muscle strength, and the effect of physical fitness and muscle strength on bone may be mediated by Sm-C. We, therefore, examined the relationship between circulating GH and Sm-C levels and physical fitness, as determined by predicted maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in 134 normal women, 34 of whom were postmenopausal. In a subgroup of 62 women overall muscle strength was estimated as the sum of the Z-sores for biceps, quadriceps, and grip strength. Overall muscle strength correlated with GH levels (r = 0.28; P less than 0.02), but not with Sm-C levels. There was a significant positive relationship between plasma Sm-C levels and VO2max in all women (r = 0.47; P less than 0.001) and in the postmenopausal group alone (r = 0.05; P less than 0.01). Although there was a significant negative relationship between Sm-C and age (r = -0.36; P = 0.001), VO2max was a better independent predictor than age (r = 0.47; P = 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of 51 sera, selected to produce a balanced distribution of antimicrosomal antibody (anti-MSA) levels, revealed (at 1:100 serum dilution) a moderately good correlation between anti-MSA and anti-hTPO antibody levels (r = 0.668; P less than 0.001). However, a number of sera with high anti-MSA levels yielded markedly discordant values between the two assays. A much lower correlation was observed between antithyroglobulin and anti-hTPO antibody levels (r = 0.315; P less than 0.05). At higher serum dilutions (1:1,000 and 1:10,000), at which low affinity, high capacity binding reactions will be reduced, the correlation between anti-MSA and anti-hTPO antibody values was greatly improved (r = 0.906 and 0.902, respectively; P less than 0.001), and there were no longer widely discrepant values between the two assays. In summary, the present study indicates that recombinant hTPO expressed in nonthyroidal cells provides an unlimited source of human TPO of unvarying quality for anti-hTPO antibody assays. This material offers increased specificity over standard anti-MSA assays that use thyroid cell microsomes as antigen.\r"

In a study of 16 families with autoimmune thyroid disease, autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) were found to be inherited as a dominant Mendelian trait in females with reduced penetrance in males. Similar results were obtained with thyroglobulin (Tg) autoantibodies. Genetic linkage analysis of the loci for TPO and Tg autoantibodies with 28 polymorphic serological markers (including HLA and Gm allotypes) was carried out in 9 families. LOD scores for some serological markers (such as Gm) were uninformative, but linkage with other markers, notably the HLA antigens -A, B, -DR, -DQ, and BF on chromosome 6, could be excluded. Further studies using a comprehensive panel of gene probes to analyze DNA from families with autoimmune thyroid disease should permit the localization of the gene cluster responsible for regulating the ability to produce autoantibodies to TPO and Tg in man.\r"

Galanin-LI was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections, using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. All 23 nontumorous pituitaries showed the presence of galanin-positive cells which were similar to the corticotrophs in shape, size, histological features, and distribution. Immunoreactivity based on the study of mirror sections was found to be present in the cytoplasm of corticotrophs, indicating that galanin-LI colocalizes with ACTH. Crooke's cells and basophilic cells spreading to the posterior lobe (basophil invasion) were also positive for galanin. No galanin-LI was seen in lactotrophs of the human pituitaries, including 4 estrogen-treated men and 4 pregnant women. Varying numbers of tumor cells in 13 of 18 corticotroph adenomas were positive for galanin. Galanin-LI and ACTH were coexpressed in the cytoplasm of the same adenoma cells. In 19 pituitary adenomas composed of cells other than corticotrophs, no galanin-LI was noted. This study is the first report providing evidence of the presence of galanin-LI in corticotrophs of the human pituitary.\r"

Thus, these individuals with ADNDI do not have apparent large deletions, insertions, or rearrangements of an AVP-NPII allele. Four restriction fragment length polymorphisms were detected with a probe for the adjacent gene on chromosome 20, oxytocin-neurophysin-I (OT-NPI). Linkage studies in these three families between the restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotypes and ADNDI phenotype strongly suggest cosegregation. This indicates that the genetic locus for ADNDI maps within or near the AVP-NPII locus and suggests that a defective AVP-NPII allele may be the basis of ADNDI.\r"

Serum samples were obtained from 24 patients with suspected autoimmune thyroid disease, and from 7 normal subjects. Microsomal autoantibodies in the patient sera, as determined by the microsomal hemagglutination assay (MCHA), varied between 1:100 and 1:102,400. Antithyroglobulin antibodies, however, were very low (less than 1:100). Binding of serum autoantibodies to purified human TPO, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, correlated fairly well with MCHA titers (r = 0.72; P less than 0.001). An immunoblot procedure was developed to study the binding of serum antibodies to the major active fragment of TPO (93 kDa), after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Binding under both conditions correlated very well with MCHA titers (r = 0.80-0.84; P less than 0.001). Studies were performed to determine the inhibitory effect of patient serum on the enzymatic activity of purified human TPO. A marked inhibitory effect on guaiacol activity was observed when TPO was preincubated with as little as 10 microL high titer serum. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.47; P less than 0.01) between MCHA titer and inhibitory effect. The addition of 2 micrograms purified human TPO completely or almost completely inhibited the binding of serum antibodies to thyroid microsomes (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in 10 of 11 patient sera with high MCHA titers (1:25,600 or greater).\r"

The degree of change in bone mineral density was quantified with Z transformation, in which we used means and SDs of bone mineral densities obtained in the process of age- and sex-matched 1:1 pairing developed by ourselves. Bone mineral density was low in female patients with hyperthyroidism in the spine, femur neck, trochanter, and Ward's triangle, but was not low in male patients. Serum osteocalcin was elevated in patients with untreated Graves' disease and correlated negatively with the Z values of bone mineral densities of the spine, femur neck, and trochanter. In conclusion, indices of osteoblastic activity were elevated in patients with hyperthyroidism, probably secondary to a thyroid hormone-induced increase in bone resorption which resulted in reduced bone mineral density. Quantification of the change in bone mineral density by using the parameters derived in the process of age- and sex-matched pairing seems to be an efficient method for statistical analyses.\r"

One antibody is immobilized onto the wall of a microtiter strip well, and the other one is labeled with a europium chelate. The assay is sensitive (0.44 pmol/L = 4.6 ng/L), but cross-reaction with free beta-subunits of hCG (beta hCG) prevents direct determination of c beta hCG in serum. To circumvent this limitation we separated hCG and beta hCG from c beta hCG by gel chromatography and quantified each component in the fractions by specific IFMAs. The high sensitivity of the newly developed IFMA enabled us to demonstrate that serum from pregnant women contains c beta hCG and elutes at the same position in gel chromatography as c beta hCG purified from urine. The proportion of c beta hCG to hCG in pregnancy serum was 0.012-0.045% (mean +/- SD, 0.028 +/- 0.01) on a molar basis. Our finding of c beta hCG in serum confirms earlier reports suggesting that proteolytic degradation of beta hCG in the kidneys may not be the only pathway by which c beta hCG is formed.\r"

In the present paper RBC Zn concentrations were measured in 10 patients with subacute thyroiditis whose total plasma T4 and T3 levels were elevated. The values were compared with those obtained in 10 patients with untreated Graves' disease, whose plasma T4 concentrations were elevated to the same level as in the former group. The RBC Zn concentration was normal in 9 of 10 patients with subacute thyroiditis, but was depressed in all patients with Graves' disease. The mean (+/- SE) RBC Zn in patients with subacute thyroiditis was 162 +/- 9 mumol/L, significantly (P less than 0.001) higher than that in Graves' disease (87 +/- 5 mumol/L). During prednisolone treatment the RBC Zn in patients with subacute thyroiditis remained at the normal level and did not change significantly, although it was slightly decreased at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. On the other hand, the RBC Zn in patients with Graves' disease was significantly increased at 8 weeks of treatment and reached the normal range in 12 weeks. These results suggest that elevation of plasma thyroid hormone concentrations in patients with subacute thyroiditis is transient and does not cause any significant change in the RBC Zn concentration.\r"

The polygraphic assessment of nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) provides an objective index of erectile capability and is useful for differentiating psychogenic from organic erectile dysfunction. In this study we evaluated NPT in six hypogonadal adult men during and after termination of androgen therapy. Multinight sleep studies were conducted within 1 week and 7-8 weeks after each man received 20 mg testosterone cypionate, im. The mean serum testosterone level 4-7 days after testosterone injection was 35.9 +/- 3.4 (+/- SE) nmol/L, and it fell to 2.3 +/- 0.9 nmol/L after 7-8 weeks. Significant declines (P less than 0.05) in the number of NPT episodes (3.7 to 2.0), maximum penile circumference increase (24 to 13 mm), and total tumescence time (107 to 55 min) accompanied the fall in the serum testosterone level. No androgen-related changes in the amount or integrity of rapid eye movement sleep were found. Finally, the mean penile rigidity (buckling pressure) decreased from 770 +/- 98 to 590 +/- 81 g (P less than 0.05). Comparison of these results to those in normal men revealed that none of these men met all diagnostic criteria for organic impotence, even 7-8 weeks after discontinuation of testosterone administration. While men with androgen deficiency may have normal NPT, sleep-related erections increase in response to testosterone administration.\r"

The administration of 4.5 g metyrapone (750 mg, orally, every 4 h) resulted in a decrease in basal (pre-CRH) plasma cortisol levels and an increase in basal plasma ACTH levels in both normal subjects and Cushing's patients. The pretreatment with metyrapone significantly blunted the increase in plasma cortisol levels and markedly enhanced ACTH secretion after iv injection of 100 micrograms human CRH. The peak ACTH levels during CRH test before and after metyrapone administration were 8 +/- 1 and 58 +/- 8 pmol/L, respectively, in normal subjects (P less than 0.01) and 26 +/- 5 and 50 +/- 11 pmol/L, respectively, in Cushing's patients (P less than 0.05). Although the basal and peak ACTH levels as well as delta ACTH (peak ACTH - basal ACTH) during the CRH test before metyrapone administration were significantly higher in Cushing's disease patients than in normal subjects (P less than 0.01), no such difference was observed between the 2 groups after metyrapone administration. The results clearly indicate that the endogenous cortisol levels greatly influence the ACTH response to CRH, and that the CRH test as commonly performed does not allow a correct evaluation of potential responsiveness of normal pituitaries and Cushing's adenomas to CRH.\r"

We previously showed that two types of hematopoietic cells derived from these patients are resistant to the in vitro growth-promoting action of GH at concentrations below 500 micrograms/L. In the current study we found that Laron T-cell lines had a mean peak augmentation of basal colony formation of 22 +/- 3.4% above baseline in response to a GH concentration of 10,000 micrograms/L. Since cloned cDNAs for human and rabbit GH receptors and rat PRL receptors show a high degree of sequence homology, we undertook studies of PRL action in cells from patients with Laron dwarfism to determine if the Laron defect was also associated with PRL unresponsiveness. Quantitating the augmentation of colony formation by T-lymphoblast cell lines established from three Laron dwarfs, we found normal responsiveness to PRL at concentrations of 25-10,000 micrograms/L. It is, thus, possible that the responsiveness of Laron T-cell lines to very high concentrations of GH could be mediated through an intact PRL (or other lactogenic) receptor based on the known affinity of GH for these receptors in other systems. These data suggest that cells from patients with Laron dwarfism have normal in vitro responsiveness to PRL and that the defect in Laron dwarfism appears to be specific to the GH receptor-effector pathway. It remains to be determined whether intact alternative lactogenic receptor mechanisms subserve any clinical effects of GH in patients with Laron dwarfism.\r"

To differentiate between hypothalamic and pituitary sites of action, we examined the effects of concurrent infusion of valine on the PRL response to iv phenylalanine in eight normal men. Since large neutral amino acids share the same high affinity blood-brain barrier transport system, entry of phenylalanine into the brain will be diminished by the simultaneous presence of high serum concentrations of valine; the pituitary, lying outside the blood-brain barrier, is not subject to these competitive effects. Valine significantly blunted the PRL response to phenylalanine, supporting an effect of phenylalanine within the blood-brain barrier to stimulate PRL release.\r"

In this review based on personal observations during examination of more than 1,000 human hearts postmortem there is initially a description of the wide variety of structural abnormalities, then a discussion of the functional consequences of these abnormalities and finally a section of general comments to weave together the structural and functional discussion in the context of clinical evaluation of patients who have small coronary artery disease.

  ".W": "The clinical syndrome \"coronary insufficiency with normal coronary arteriogram\" is found in approximately 10% to 20% of patients with exercise-induced coronary insufficiency. In most of these cases, disturbances of the coronary microcirculation are present. They can appear in vascular diseases (arterial hypertension, systemic immunopathies, immune complex vasculitis), in rheologic diseases (paraproteinemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, polyglobulia) and in disturbances of transport and diffusion of oxygen (carbon monoxide intoxication, methemoglobinemia). The clinical diagnosis is based on the usual diagnostic procedures (electrocardiogram, exercise electrocardiogram, responsiveness to nitroglycerin), as well as on newer functionally oriented diagnostic procedures (determinations of coronary blood flow and coronary vascular reserve, production of lactate, serologic findings, histology and immune histology of peripheral arteries, measurements of viscosities in both plasma and blood). Many clinically relevant disturbances in the coronary microcirculation can thus be detected and treated on a rational basis by management of the underlying main disease, that is, by treatment of the vascular, rheologic and metabolic disorders. Persistent angina pectoris in the presence of a normal coronary arteriogram does not represent an end to coronary diagnostic procedures, but introduces the clinical task of using all diagnostic possibilities to enable functional and therapeutic assessment of the coronary microcirculation.\r"

More objects could be identified in the moving cinearteriogram than in single cine frames. Using the largest object as the calibration standard, diameters less than 1 mm were markedly overestimated. A simple morphometric method showed that arteriographic visualization of small vessels was better by digital processing than by cine recording. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the average size of the smallest identifiable vessel by either method (0.5 versus 0.51 mm). After correcting for overestimation and the inaccurate imaging of the smallest detectable vessels, the practical arteriographic threshold is approximately 0.5 mm. Parametric imaging holds promise, but its significance for evaluating small vessel disease has yet to be determined.\r"

  ".U": "90171361\r", 
  ".W": "A series of 198 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were prospectively studied before hospital discharge and during 24.0 +/- 8.6 months of follow-up. A predischarge thrombus was found in 38 (31%) of 124 patients with anterior infarction but in none of 74 patients with inferior infarction (p less than 0.001). Early thrombolytic therapy in 34 patients did not decrease the rate of thrombus occurrence. Acute anterior infarction, ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% and apical dyskinesia or aneurysm (but not akinesia) were significantly related to the appearance of thrombus during hospitalization by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Echocardiographic follow-up of 159 patients for at least 6 months (mean 26.6 +/- 8.4) revealed that thrombus disappeared in 14 (48%) of 29. Disappearance of thrombus was related to predischarge apical akinesia (but not dyskinesia) and to warfarin therapy during the follow-up period. A new thrombus first appeared after hospital discharge in 13 of 130 patients, and in 7 of the 13 it resolved during further follow-up. Thus, 30% (13 of 42) of thrombi in these patients appeared after discharge from the hospital. Three factors were related to occurrence of new thrombi during the follow-up period: deterioration in left ventricular ejection fraction, predischarge ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% and ventricular aneurysm or dyskinesia. Systemic embolism occurred in six patients, all with a predischarge thrombus (p less than 0.001). Mobility of the thrombus was the only variable significantly related to subsequent embolic events (p = 0.001) by logistic regression analysis. Thus, the predischarge echocardiogram identifies patients with thrombus and those at highest risk of embolic events. It can indicate patients who are likely to have thrombus resolution and those at risk of developing a new thrombus after hospital discharge. Follow-up echocardiograms may help in guiding the length of long-term anticoagulant therapy. Four additional patients with a predischarge apical mobile thrombus (not part of the consecutive series) received thrombolytic therapy. In two of the four, lysis of thrombus was achieved without complications, but systemic embolism occurred in the other two, and proved fatal in one.\r"

In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, isovolumic relaxation was prolonged (94 +/- 25 ms); peak early diastolic flow velocity (53 +/- 18 cm/s), deceleration of flow velocity in early diastole (341 +/- 142 cm/s2) and the ratio between early and late peaks of flow velocity (1.6 +/- 0.9) were reduced; and peak late diastolic flow velocity was increased (38 +/- 15 cm/s) compared with values in control subjects (76 +/- 12 ms, 65 +/- 12 cm/s, 512 +/- 131 cm/s2, 2.3 +/- 0.8 and 30 +/- 7 cm/s, respectively; p less than 0.001). Individual patient analysis showed that diastolic filling was abnormal in 52 (67%) of the 78 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

These were Group 1, 37 patients with recent aortic valve replacement surgery and no clinical or echocardiographic evidence of valve dysfunction; Group 2, 12 patients with prosthetic valve stenosis documented by cardiac catheterization; and Group 3, 22 patients with both Doppler and catheterization studies in whom noninvasive and invasive determinations of aortic valve area could be directly compared. Left ventricular outflow tract diameter was measured from two-dimensional still frame images. Flow velocity proximal to the aortic valve, transvalvular velocity and acceleration time were determined from pulsed and continuous wave Doppler spectra. Aortic valve gradient was calculated with the modified Bernoulli equation and valve area by the continuity equation. In the 37 patients with a normally functioning valve, the calculated mean gradient ranged from 5 to 25 mm Hg (average 13.6 +/- 5.2) and valve area from 1.0 to 2.3 cm2 (mean 1.6 +/- 0.31). Linear regression analysis of prosthetic aortic valve area determined by Doppler imaging and cardiac catheterization demonstrated a high correlation (r = 0.93) between the two techniques. Comparison of the patients with and without prosthetic valve stenosis revealed statistically significant differences in mean gradient (42.8 +/- 12.3 versus 13.6 +/- 5.2 mm Hg; p = 0.0001), acceleration time (116 +/- 15 versus 80 +/- 13 ms; p = 0.0001) and valve area by the continuity equation (0.80 +/- 0.16 versus 1.6 +/- 0.31 cm2; p = 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Double potentials were recorded from the right atrium in all patients during atrial flutter. Double potentials were evaluated during transient entrainment of atrial flutter by rapid high right atrial pacing in 5 of the 10 patients. In four of these five patients during such transient entrainment 1) one deflection of the double potential was captured with a relatively short activation time (mean interval 89 +/- 45 ms) and the other deflection was captured with a relatively long activation time (mean interval 233 +/- 24 ms), producing a paradoxical decrease in the short interdeflection interval from a mean of 75 +/- 20 ms to a mean of 59 +/- 24 ms; and 2) the configuration of the double potential remained similar to that observed during spontaneous atrial flutter. On pacing termination 1) the two double potential deflections were found to be associated with two different atrial flutter complexes in the electrocardiogram (ECG); 2) the previous double potential deflection relation resumed; and 3) when sinus rhythm was present, the double potentials were replaced by a broad, low amplitude electrogram recording at the same site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Furthermore, this perfusion ratio correlated inversely with the preoperative (p less than 0.005) and postoperative (p less than 0.02) right pulmonary artery area index, defined as the ratio of cross-sectional area to the normal value. Of five patients with less than 90% arterial oxygen saturation, four showed an abnormal distribution of pulmonary blood flow greater than the normal perfusion ratio. No patient had evidence of a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula by the echocardiographic contrast study. These results suggest that abnormal distribution of pulmonary blood flow to the upper lung segment may develop in patients after the Fontan procedure, and that insufficient size of the pulmonary artery before operation and the consequent postoperative elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance may be responsible for this perfusion abnormality.\r"

  ".W": "This study analyzes the results of angioplasty in 905 consecutive patients with 971 total occlusions. The procedures were performed by five cardiologists from January 1980 to January 1989 at one institution. The overall success rate per lesion was 72%. Even the most experienced operator (524 occlusions attempted) has continued to improve on a learning curve, with 83% of his most recent 100 occlusions successfully dilated. Procedural death occurred in seven patients (0.8%), five patients (0.6%) sustained a myocardial infarction and seven patients (0.8%) required urgent coronary bypass surgery. Complications were significantly more likely to occur in the elderly, in women and in patients with triple vessel disease and depressed left ventricular function. Compared with angioplasty in 6,950 patients with nonoccluded stenoses, angioplasty of total occlusions had a lower success rate (72% versus 96%, p = 0.001), although the complication rate was also lower (1.9% versus 3.5%, p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis of 20 clinical and angiographic variables in 100 consecutive patients undergoing angioplasty of 104 total occlusions in 1988 identified only bridging collateral vessels (85% success rate if absent versus 18% if present, p less than 0.001) and a tapered occlusion morphology (88% success rate if present versus 59% if absent, p = 0.01) as independent correlates of procedural outcome. Other variables, including the estimated duration of occlusion, lesion length and location, and extent of disease were unrelated to technical success. With present techniques and sufficient operator experience, 70% to 80% of total occlusions can be successfully recanalized by coronary angioplasty with a complication rate of less than 2%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The threshold dose of the selective thromboxane receptor antagonist SQ 30,741 for increasing reflow during thrombolysis was identified and then evaluated in a model of myocardial ischemia with reperfusion. In anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys, stenotic carotid arteries were occluded with a platelet-rich thrombus by electrical stimulation and recanalized with streptokinase (680 U/min intraarterially for 1 h) and heparin (200 U/kg + 120 U/h intravenously for 3 h). Concurrent administration of SQ 30,741 (2.1 mg/kg + 0.5 mg/kg per h intravenously for 3 h; n = 4) enhanced the extent of reflow 174% compared with saline solution (n = 4; p less than 0.05) during the third hour, when lower doses were ineffective. This threshold dose was tested in anesthetized African green monkeys subjected to 90 min of left circumflex coronary artery occlusion and 5 h of reperfusion. SQ 30,741 (n = 8) or saline solution (n = 11) was administered 2 min before reperfusion and continued throughout reperfusion. The heart was removed on termination of reperfusion and perfused in vitro with Evans blue and triphenyltetrazolium chloride dyes to stain tissue at risk and infarcted tissue, respectively. The percent of left ventricle at risk did not differ between saline- (37 +/- 4%) and SQ 30,741-treated (35 +/- 3%) monkeys. In contrast, infarcted tissue expressed as percent of the left ventricle at risk was less (p less than 0.01) in monkeys receiving SQ 30,741 (31 +/- 2%) than in those receiving saline solution (49 +/- 5%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Employing the new concept of systolic myocardial stiffness, this study addresses the questions of linearity of the end-systolic stress-strain relations in left ventricular hypertrophy and the preload dependence of fiber shortening rate. Pressure overload hypertrophy was induced in six puppies by banding the ascending aorta. Ultrasonic crystals were implanted for measurement of short axis and wall thickness in the six dogs with hypertrophy and in five control dogs. A pressure catheter was inserted through the apex for left ventricular pressure measurement. Load was altered by graded infusions of phenylephrine in the setting of beta-adrenergic blockade. Linearity of the end-systolic stress-strain relations was observed in all cases, and preload-corrected shortening rate-afterload relations were derived from these stress-strain relations. Without preload correction, mid wall and endocardial shortening rate were depressed (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.005, respectively) in the hypertrophy group. However, with preload correction at 35 g/cm2, there was no significant difference in shortening rate between the control and hypertrophy groups at afterloads of 150, 200 and 250 g/cm2. Endocardial shortening rate at a preload of 25 versus 35 g/cm2 demonstrated a preload dependence in both the control (p less than 0.04) and the hypertrophy group (p less than 0.01). Mid wall shortening rate displayed a preload dependence only in the hypertrophy group (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that end-systolic stress-strain relations are linear in control conditions and in hypertrophy, fiber shortening rate is preload-dependent and, thus, shortening rate-afterload relations currently used to assess myocardial contractility need to be modified to account for these preload effects.\r"

Five patients with temporal lobe epilepsy are described in whom sinus bradyarrhythmias and syncope were prominent manifestations of seizure activity. Partial improvement occurred in one of two patients in whom a permanent pacemaker was implanted before a diagnosis of epilepsy was established. Treatment with phenytoin or carbamazepine resulted in nearly complete resolution of symptoms in all five patients. Because pacemaker implantation does not prevent recurrent symptoms, but anticonvulsant therapy does, this experience underscores the importance of considering the diagnosis of partial epilepsy in selected patients with sinus bradyarrhythmias and syncope.\r"

Consumption of the food items was estimated as the difference between the weight of a randomly selected full serving of each item and the score on the visual estimation scale, which had been expressed as a proportion of that full-serving weight. The bias of the visual estimates averaged 2.2 gm; their imprecision averaged 13.7 gm. The small amount of bias in these estimates only slightly influences the results of studies using them as a substitute for weighed data. However, the much larger amount of imprecision must be accounted for. Sample size requirements for the detection of a statistically significant difference in food consumption between two or more groups using visual estimates of plate waste will be greater than those required when exact weighing techniques are used. In addition, the accuracy of dietary self-report data will be underestimated when such visual estimates are used as criterion measures of food consumption unless statistical adjustments are made to correct for the impact of the documented imprecision.\r"

Mean daily servings of 40 foods and food groups were calculated for four age groups: 1 to 2 years, 3 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and 12 to 17 years. The HHANES food servings data were combined into four major groups and compared with recommended servings for children. Mean daily servings of the milk group exceeded the recommended two to three servings for younger children but were low for teenagers. Meat group servings (including eggs and nuts/legumes) exceeded the recommended two daily servings for all age groups, whereas bread group intakes averaged 70% to 80% of a recommendation of four servings but only half of a recommendation of six servings. Intakes of fruits and vegetables were lowest, averaging only 33% to 47% of a recommended four servings, or 26% to 38% of a recommended five servings. Servings of all four groups were lowest for teenagers. A dietary score, based on the number of servings from each of the four groups, was developed for each child. Mean dietary scores ranged from 55% (teenagers) to 70% (toddlers and preschoolers) of the recommended score. According to these analyses, dietary guidance for Mexican-American children should focus on increasing intakes of fruits and vegetables and on encouraging more nutritious food choices by teenagers.\r"

  ".W": "Selection of dietary assessment methodology is important in dietary intervention studies. Few studies have reported the relative merits of various assessment methods or the feasibility of electronic methods in pediatric populations. Parent-child dyads performed telephone recalls (no. = 32) and tape recorded dietary records (no. = 33). Traditional recalls were first conducted to familiarize parents and children with the telephone recall procedure, to introduce two-dimensional food models, and to instruct on the use of the tape recorder. Parents monitored and documented as unobtrusively as possible the child's intake on the day before the telephone recall and also on the day of the taped record. Children were called at random to reduce bias. Simple correlation coefficients (r) were calculated for nine nutrients and calories for both methods. For telephone recalls, values ranged from a low of r = .64 for saturated and polyunsaturated fat to r = .85 for cholesterol and r = .93 for iron. Tape-recorded data yielded r = .80 or above, except calories with r = .68 (p less than .001 for all values, 1-tail tests). Mean nutrient values were within expected ranges, e.g., 1,800 kcal +/- 500, with saturated fat about 14% of calories per day. Comparisons between parents and childrens reports of food frequencies and portion sizes revealed the best correlations for beverages, bread-cereals-crackers, meat-fish-poultry, and mixed dishes. We conclude that preadolescent children are able to provide dietary intake data using electronic methods in a manner that compares favorably with their parents' written records.\r"

  ".W": "Intraosseous (IO) access in adults via the distal tibia has never been a widely accepted technique. Yet there have been occasional reports of the successful use of this procedure. This study was done to demonstrate the utility of IO infusions in the adult patient, including those patients in cardiac arrest. Twenty-two patients, aged 36 through 84 (mean 65.1 years), who arrived in the emergency department (ED) in cardiac arrest from nonhypovolemic causes and in whom an intravenous line was not established prior to arrival or was found to be inadequate (nonfunctioning or poorly functioning) upon arrival in the ED, had an IO needle (13-gauge Kormed/Jamshidi, Pharmaseal Division, Baxter Healthcare Corp., Valencia, CA) placed above the medial malleolus. The IO needle was then connected to a standard IV tubing, with a pressure bag or pressure device delivering 300 mm Hg to the solution bag. The resultant flow rate through the IV line ranged from 5 to 12 mL/min. The IO needle was placed and flow established in under one minute in all patients. Temporally related pharmacologic effects were observed after the IO administration of sodium bicarbonate, lidocaine, atropine, and vasopressors. This study shows that I.O. access can be quickly and easily obtained in adults in the medial supramalleolar position during cardiac arrest. This method of drug administration appears to hold promise as another useful modality for adults and older children during nontraumatic resuscitations.\r"

Our department has a weekly swine laboratory devoted to training residents, interns and students in resuscitative procedures. Physicians who participated in our swine procedure laboratory over the past three years were queried as to their prelaboratory and postlaboratory comfort levels with six different resuscitative procedures, and 57 (76%) physicians responded. Statistical analysis of the data showed significant improvement in comfort levels for all six procedures. Every responder felt the swine laboratory helped or will help them perform the procedures on humans. We also surveyed all U.S. emergency medicine residency program directors from established programs regarding the status of their animal procedure laboratories, and 67 of the 68 (98%) directors responded. Of these responders, 62% offer an animal procedure laboratory. Overall, 97% of the residency directors rated the laboratory successful, and 97% of the residents rated the laboratory successful. Therefore, we conclude that an ongoing emergency medicine animal procedure laboratory is a valuable tool for improving physician-in-training ability and confidence.\r"

Haloperidol failed to prevent amphetamine-induced seizures, but did lower the mortality rate at most doses tested. Haloperidol decreased the incidence of cocaine-induced seizures at the two highest doses, but the lowering of the mortality rate did not reach statistical significance at any dose. These data suggest a protective role for the central dopamine blocker haloperidol against death from high-dose amphetamine exposure without reducing the incidence of seizures. In contrast, haloperidol demonstrated an ability to reduce cocaine-induced seizures without significantly reducing mortality.\r"

The use of portable pulse oximetry monitors should rapidly become routine during the transport of critically ill patients.\r"

In particular, simultaneous transmission by multiple callers on the same frequency can result in blocked transmissions and miscommunications. In contrast, nonvoice transmission of data requires less time than does voice communication of the same data, and may be more accurate. We conducted a pilot study to test the feasibility of a microcomputer assisted communication (MAC) network linking the disaster scene and the command hospital. The radio chosen to transmit data from the field disaster site to the command hospital was a cellular telephone connected to the microcomputer by modem. Typed communications between the microcomputer operators enabled dialogue between the disaster site and the hospitals. A computer program using commercially available software (Symphony by Lotus, Inc.) was written to allow for data entry, data transmission, and reports. Patient data, including age, sex, severity of injury, identification number, major injuries, and hospital destination were successfully transmitted from the disaster site command post to the command hospital. This pilot test demonstrated the potential applicability of MAC for facilitating transmission of patient data during a disaster.\r"

Activation signals include antigen and surface Ig cross-linking agents such as anti-mu or anti-delta. Signals inducing proliferation include IL-2, high m.w.-B cell growth factor (BCGF), and low m.w.-BCGF. IL-2 as well as IL-6 and other partially characterized B cell differentiation factors can induce terminal differentiation of proliferating B cells into Ig-secreting plasma cells. Various C components have been described to regulate B cell function including Bb that enhances proliferation, C5a that enhances Ig production, and C3a that inhibits Ig production. In our study, we examined the ability of the factor B cleavage fragment Ba to influence human B cell function. Ba did not affect the activation of resting B cells but inhibited the proliferation of activated B cells stimulated with either high m.w.-BCGF or low m.w.-BCGF. The inhibition occurred with doses of Ba as low as 1 microgram/ml (29 nM). Ba was found to bind to activated human B lymphocytes in a saturable manner with an apparent K of approximately 25 nM and an apparent Bmax of 56,000 sites/cell. A peptide made of the carboxy terminal 10 amino acids of Ba (GHGPGEQQKR), was also found to inhibit growth factor induced proliferation of activated B cells but at an ID50 of approximately 5 microM. Finally, Ba was found to inhibit the terminal differentiation of Staphylococcus aweus Cowan-activated B cells stimulated with B cell differentiation factors but not Ig secretion by the partially differentiated EBV-transformed cell line SKW.6. Thus, concentrations of Ba achievable in vivo at sites of active inflammation were found to act on human B lymphocytes by inhibiting their proliferation. This may act to limit the immune response to a specific antigenic challenge.\r"

While investigating their mechanisms of action, we found that one of these copolymers, L81, induced the expression of macrophage Ia in vivo. L81 is a 2750-Da, linear copolymer with a 43-unit core of hydrophobic polyoxypropylene flanked on each side by 3 U of hydrophilic polyoxyethylene. It induced threefold to sevenfold increases in the proportion of peritoneal macrophages expressing I-A from 5 to 7 days after an i.p. injection of 5 mg. As little as 1 mg caused a twofold increase. I-A density increased with time after injection of L81. Macrophages induced by L81 actively synthesized I-A, showing an 18-fold increase in biosynthetic capacity. Ia induction did not require the presence of mature T lymphocytes, because similar increases in I-A expression were seen in athymic and euthymic mice. L81-induced macrophages were 10-fold more effective than normal macrophages in presenting Ag to a T cell hybridoma. Other functional studies showed that they were primed for the secretion of superoxide ion and could be stimulated in vitro by IFN-gamma and LPS to lyse tumor target cells. These results suggest that the induction of macrophage Ia expression by L81 may play a role in its activity as an immunoadjuvant.\r"

In contrast, low-density cells and resting B cells stimulated the clones to produce similar levels of inositol phosphates, a rapid biochemical event dependent only on occupancy of the TCR. The inefficient stimulation of T cell proliferation by resting B cell APC was dramatically improved by the addition of allogeneic low-density accessory cells incapable of being recognized by the TCR on the responding T cells. The results are most consistent with a model where low-density and resting B cell APC display similar amounts of Ag/Ia molecule complexes capable of being recognized by the TCR on the responding T cells but differ in the provision of costimulatory signals that, together with TCR occupancy, are required for IL-2 production.\r"

  ".W": "Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots were used to characterize tyrosine phosphorylated proteins after stimulation of the human TCR. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation was evident on at least 12 substrates within 2 min after ligation of the TCR with mAb. Analysis of the time course for increased tyrosine phosphorylation revealed distinct patterns. Increased phosphorylation of 135-kDa and 100-kDa substrates was evident within 5 s, whereas increased phosphorylation of the TCR-zeta-chain required several minutes after treatment with anti-CD3 mAb. This rapid cellular tyrosine phosphorylation occurred independent of the cell cycle, as it occurred after stimulation of resting T cells, T cell blasts, and the Jurkat T cell leukemia line. When the TCR complex was cross-linked together with the CD4 receptor by heteroconjugate anti-CD3/CD4 mAb, an increased magnitude of tyrosine phosphorylation occurred, although no new substrates could be detected. The increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 135-kDa and 100-kDa substrates was specific in that anti-HLA class I, anti-CD6, anti-CD7, and anti-CD28 antibodies did not cause increased tyrosine phosphorylation. Anti-CD4 stimulation of resting T cells did not cause increased tyrosine phosphorylation of pp100 and pp135, suggesting that the CD4-associated kinase, lck, does not account for the tyrosine phosphorylation observed after TCR stimulation. Similarly, pharmacologic treatment of cells with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore did not cause increased tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates, indicating that activation of protein kinase C or phospholipase C does not account for these early increases in tyrosine phosphorylation. The time of onset of pp100 phosphorylation, and the magnitude of phosphorylation correlated with the magnitude of calcium mobilization when cells were stimulated with different forms of TCR stimulation. When cells were labeled with [3H]myoinositol and analyzed after stimulation by anti-CD3 mAb, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 135-kDa and 100-kDa substrates preceded the activation of phospholipase C, as measured by the appearance of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. This occurred in both T cell blasts and in the Jurkat T cell line. Thus, these findings show that increased tyrosine phosphorylation is the earliest yet detected signal observed after ligation of the TCR complex, and furthermore suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation might link the TCR to the phosphatidylinositolbisphosphate hydrolysis signaling pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The cells recognize a bimolecular ligand composed of a self Ia molecule and a fragment of foreign Ag that has been processed by an APC. The effect of self proteins on the processing and presentation of foreign Ag was examined in order to ascertain the mechanisms for competition between foreign and self Ag. How this competition can be overcome to allow an efficient immune response was also examined. Normal mouse serum proteins (NMS) compete for the processing and presentation of the foreign Ag bovine RNase by APC. This competition could have occurred at any of three levels in the APC: 1) Ag uptake, 2) Ag processing, or 3) the binding of Ag to an Ia molecule. No competition for either the uptake or the processing of RNase by self proteins could be demonstrated. However, self peptides do compete with foreign Ag by binding directly to Ia molecules, as has been shown previously. Thus, the observed inhibition by NMS of Ag presentation occurred because of competition for binding to the Ia molecule. We hypothesized that during the generation of an immune response this competition is overcome by enhanced uptake of foreign Ag. To test this, we compared the ability of NMS to compete for the presentation of RNase when it entered the APC via fluid-phase pinocytosis or through receptor-mediated uptake via the mannose receptor. When the RNase entered the APC through the mannose receptor, the ability of NMS to compete was dramatically reduced. Thus, self proteins constitutively compete for the presentation of foreign Ag at the level of binding to an Ia molecule, and this competition can be overcome by receptor-mediated uptake of the Ag.\r"

We show here in an experimental system that the anti-CD9 mAb 50H.19, ALB6, and BA-2 can induce rapid, and irreversible, homotypic aggregation of the CD9-positive pre-B lymphoblastoid cell lines NALM-6 and HOON, but not of the CD9-negative B cell line Raji. The specificity of the response is indicated by the failure to effect aggregation with mAb directed to CD24, or to HLA class I Ag. The initiation of strong homotypic aggregates of lymphoid cells is a property ascribed to lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 (LFA-1), a member of the beta 2 subfamily of leukocyte integrins. We show that CD9-induced aggregation is an active process which proceeds at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C, requires the expenditure of metabolic energy, and a functioning cytoskeleton, and is not inhibited by Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptide. These are properties described for LFA-1-mediated aggregation. However, because beta 2-integrins are not expressed on NALM-6 or HOON cells, they are not the mediators of CD9-induced aggregation. In contrast to LFA-1-mediated adhesion which is Mg2+ dependent, CD9-induced adhesion has an absolute requirement for Ca2+, but not Mg2+, indicating that a Ca2(+)-dependent event is sufficient for adhesion. However, Mg2+ enhances adhesion even at optimal concentrations of Ca2+, implicating an additional Mg2(+)-dependent event which requires Ca2+ to be effective. These findings suggest that CD9 Ag regulates a novel mechanism for promoting tight cell-cell adhesion which requires both Ca2+ and Mg2+ for optimal expression.\r"

Flow microfluorimetry was used to assess changes in free intracytoplasmic calcium concentration [Ca2+] in indo-loaded B cells, immediately after exposure to anti-mu antibody and to monovalent or polyvalent CR2 ligands. As monovalent ligands we used the C3d fragment and synthetic C3 peptides (peptides P14, residues 1201-1214, and P28, residues 1187-1214). As polyvalent ligands we used i) an intact monoclonal mouse anti-CR2 antibody (HB5) and its F(ab')2 fragment, ii) tetravalent P13 [residues 1202-1214) 4-template), and iii) P28 conjugated to BSA (molar ratio 5/1). Anti-CR2 antibody HB5, tetravalent P13, and P28 conjugated to BSA, enhanced the ability of F(ab')2 fragments of the IgG fraction of goat anti-human mu antibody to increase human B cell [Ca2+]i. In contrast, the monomeric CR2 ligands C3d and P28 inhibited the anti-mu-induced increase in human B cell [Ca2+]i. Multivalent P13, P28, and the HB5, by themselves, did not affect B cell [Ca2+]i.

  ".W": "The rearrangement of TCR genes during thymic ontogeny creates a repertoire of T cell specificities that is refined to ensure the deletion of autoreactive clones and the MHC restriction of T cell responses. Signals delivered via the accessory molecules CD2, CD4, and CD8 have a crucial role in this phase of T cell differentiation. Recently, CD28 has been identified as a signal transducing molecule on the surface of most mature T cells. Perturbation of the CD28 molecule stimulates a novel pathway of T cell activation regulating the production of a variety of lymphokines including IL-2. We have studied the expression and function of CD28 during thymic ontogeny, and in resting and activated PBL. A variable percentage of resting thymocytes were CD28+ (3 to 25%, n = 8), but it was found in high density only on mature CD3+(bright) CD4/CD8 cells. Both unseparated thymocytes and isolated CD3-CD28-/dull cells proliferated when stimulated with PMA plus IL-2 or PMA plus ionomycin. PMA treatment also rapidly up-regulated CD28 expression in the CD3- subset as these cells became CD3-CD28+(bright). Despite the ability of PMA to induce high density CD28 expression in CD3- cells, CD3- thymocytes did not proliferate in response to PMA plus anti-CD28 mAb, in contrast to unseparated cells. CD3+ thymocytes stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb also failed to proliferate in culture. However, the addition of either IL-2 or anti-CD28 mAb supported proliferation, suggesting that only CD3+ cells could respond to CD28 signaling. The comitogenic effect of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb was IL-2 dependent as it was abrogated by an anti-IL-2R mAb. Interestingly, the expression of CD28 on the cell surface of CD3+ cells was also inducible, as flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a 10-fold increase in cell surface CD28 by 24 to 48 h after anti-CD3 stimulation of both CD3+ thymocytes and peripheral blood T cells. This increase was accounted for by a commensurate increase in CD28 mRNA levels. Together, these results suggest that CD28 is an inducible T cell antigen in both CD3- and CD3+ cells. In addition, stimulation of the CD28 pathway can provide a second signal to support the growth of CD3+ thymocytes stimulated through the TCR/CD3 complex, and may therefore represent a mechanism for positive selection during thymic ontogeny.\r"

T cells primed to this peptide were found to demonstrate significant proliferation when challenged in vitro with either the homologous peptide or the intact AChR. Adoptive transfer of the peptide-immune T cells into immunologically naive recipient rats followed by AChR challenge resulted in the production of anti-AChR antibodies very similar to those produced under the regulation of T cells immune to the entire intact AChR with regard to overall clonotypic heterogeneity (measured by IEF) and their ability to interfere with AChR-dependent muscle contraction. Interestingly, when the threonine at position 106 was substituted with a proline, the resulting peptide continued to be equally, if not exceedingly, capable of stimulating T cell-proliferative responses, but was found to be ineffective at stimulating the levels of anti-AChR antibodies necessary for producing neuromuscular dysfunction.\r"

All the lines had CD4+ phenotype and strongly recognized the alpha-pool. Four lines cross-reacted with native Torpedo AcChR. Five lines showed, at certain stages of their propagation, some degree of reactivity to autologous or DR-matched APC. One of the CD4+ T lines was challenged with each one of the peptides present in the alpha-pool. Several peptides, corresponding to the sequence segments 48-67, 101-120, 304-322, 320-337, and 419-437 of the human alpha-subunit were recognized, indicating that different epitopes and multiple T cell clones are involved in the recognition of the autoantigen in MG. Human AcChR-specific CD4+ T cell lines will be useful to identify the repertoire of epitopes recognized by the autoreactive Th cells in MG, to investigate the TCR genes utilized by autoreactive Th cells and to develop specific immunosuppressive treatments using anti-T cell vaccination.\r"

When compared with freshly isolated donor lymphocytes, the engrafted donor cells exhibited markedly reduced to absent responses toward host Ag in primary or secondary MLC and cell-mediated lympholysis assays. However, under limiting dilution conditions, cytotoxic responses to host Ag could be demonstrated, indicating that small numbers of host reactive cells were present, although down-regulated at high responder cell doses. These results are consistent with prior observations in limiting dilution cultures that indicate that cells with the potential to lyse autologous target cells exist in the peripheral blood of all normal individuals. The number of host reactive cells present in these patients is significantly less than that present in cells isolated directly from the marrow donors, and is also less than the number of autocytotoxic cells normally seen in peripheral blood. Together, these observations indicate that two mechanisms contribute to donor host tolerance in these patients. The majority of host reactive cells appear to have undergone clonal deletion or inactivation, whereas the small residual host-reactive population appears to be under ongoing immunoregulatory control.\r"

In our previous studies we showed a direct correlation between such resistance and the level of natural suppressor (NS) activity in the host. Thus newborn mice that have high NS activity are very resistant to marrow engraftment, as are adults pretreated with CFA that increases NS activity in the bone marrow. We have now devised a method that allows us to follow hemopoietic engraftment kinetics within the marrow cavity itself by assaying individual CFU-granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells for their host or donor origin over the immediate post-transplant period. By using this method, we find a close correlation between the rate of marrow engraftment and reduction in host NS activity. Marrow engraftment does not correlate with the reduction of either total host bone marrow cellular content or CFU-granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cell levels. NS activity is mediated by Thy-1-, partially radiosensitive, nylon wool nonadherent cells without NK activity. Adoptively transferred Thy-1-, irradiated spleen cells containing NS activity induced by pretreatment with CFA delayed engraftment kinetics in the marrow cavity. Thus hemopoietic engraftment in the marrow cavity appears to be controlled by an inhibitory regulatory activity that is reflected in the in vitro NS assay. These studies suggest new regulatory targets for selective host conditioning to eliminate resistance to marrow transplantation.\r"

This study examined the question of whether autoantibodies to other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases occur in the sera of myositis patients. We tested sera from patients with myositis with unidentified anticytoplasmic antibodies that immunoprecipitate tRNA for the ability to inhibit the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for the remaining 17 amino acids. Three sera showed strong inhibitory activity for a synthetase. OJ and NJ sera (and IgG) significantly inhibited isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase activity, each with 94% inhibition at the screening dilution, whereas other test sera and controls all inhibited less than 50%. OJ and NJ sera immunoprecipitated identical patterns of tRNA, and identical, complex patterns of high m.w. polypeptides that were consistent with the multienzyme synthetase complex of which isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase is a part. EJ serum (and IgG) significantly inhibited glycyl-tRNA synthetase, and immunoprecipitated a unique pattern of transfer RNA, and a strong predominant protein band of 77 kDa. These data strongly suggest that OJ and NJ have autoantibodies to isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, and that EJ has antibodies to glycyl-tRNA synthetase. The findings of signs of muscle involvement in all three patients, and severe interstitial lung disease in OJ, strengthens the association of antisynthetases with these conditions.\r"

In vitro studies have implied that TNF-alpha has predominantly proinflammatory and immunostimulatory effects, but paradoxically in vivo studies have demonstrated that administration of TNF-alpha suppresses murine lupus. To assess the effects of TNF-alpha on immune function in normal mice, we treated C57BL/6 mice with recombinant murine TNF-alpha (10 micrograms i.p.) or PBS on alternate days for up to 8 wk. Administration of TNF-alpha decreased the percentage of splenic T and B cells and increased the percentage of splenic macrophages without significantly altering the total number of mononuclear cells. Administration of TNF-alpha also caused progressive inhibition of splenic lymphocyte function, out of proportion to the quantitative reduction in B and T cells. After 8 wk of therapy, the proliferative responses of splenic lymphocytes to Con A, PHA, and LPS were reduced by 100, 90, and 60%, respectively, in treated mice compared with control mice. The reduction in T cell proliferation was due primarily to alteration of accessory cell function rather than direct inhibition of T cell function. Treatment with TNF-alpha markedly inhibited T cell cytotoxicity induced by immunization with allogenic target cells, and it virtually ablated NK cell activity. Inhibition of these in vitro tests of lymphocyte function correlated with inhibition of delayed type hypersensitivity in vivo. In contrast, treatment with TNF-alpha did not impair humoral immunity. These findings imply that TNF-alpha may affect cell-mediated immunity more profoundly than humoral immunity. This observation may be relevant to the mechanism whereby TNF-alpha suppresses murine lupus.\r"

The activity of the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) was assessed by the ability of the enzyme to phosphorylate histone H1 in the presence of calcium, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine or after proteolytic activation of PKC with trypsin. In high serum-supplemented cells, but not in cells that were preincubated in serum-deficient media for 6 h, subsequent treatment for 15 min with synthetic IL-3 (10 micrograms/ml) caused up to a sixfold increase in the calcium- and lipid-stimulated histone H1 phosphorylating activity of particulate-associated PKC after fractionation on MonoQ. However, there was no corresponding reduction of cytosolic PKC activity. Therefore, IL-3 appeared to modify the activity of preexisting membrane-associated PKC rather than eliciting its recruitment from the cytoplasm in R6-XE.4 cells. This was in contrast to the situation with FDC-P1 cells, where IL-3 induced PKC translocation. IL-3 also stimulated a cytosolic protein kinase that phosphorylated a synthetic peptide patterned after a phosphorylation site in ribosomal protein S6, but this IL did not alter the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.\r"

The production levels of this activity were increased after stimulation with the phorbol ester analog, mezerein, and the calcium ionophore, A23187. Complete purification of a protein having this activity from conditioned media of induced MRC-5 cells was achieved using gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The first 14 residues of the purified protein identified by amino-terminal sequencing were identical to the first 14 residues of IL-6. Recombinant human IL-6 was tested and found to promote megakaryocyte growth. IL-1 beta, another component detected in MRC-5 conditioned media, was unable to promote megakaryocyte colony formation but did reduce the concentration of IL-6 necessary to support megakaryocyte colony formation. Immunoprecipitation using rabbit antiserum prepared against IL-6 removed the megakaryocyte growth activity found in MRC-5 conditioned media. Thus, connective tissue cells such as fibroblasts in the bone marrow may co-stimulate thrombocytopoiesis via IL-6 and, possibly, via IL-1 production.\r"

  ".W": "Human FcR for IgG can be divided into three classes (Fc gamma RI, II, and III) based on their structure and reactivity with mAb. Fc gamma RII can be further subdivided into two categories based on functional and biochemical assays. These two Fc gamma RII subtypes were initially recognized by the failure of T cells from 40% of individuals to proliferate in response to mAb Leu 4 (mouse IgG1, anti-CD3), a response that requires the binding of the Fc region of the Leu 4 mAb to Fc gamma RII on monocyte accessory cells. Inas-much as mouse IgG1, does not bind efficiently to the nonresponder form of Fc gamma RII, mAb Leu 4 is unable to induce proliferation in these individuals. IEF data on Fc gamma RII from Leu 4 responder and nonresponder individuals suggested that the structural gene for Fc gamma RII consisted of two allelic forms R (responder) and N (nonresponder) producing the phenotypes RR, RN, and NN. Thus, exclusive expression of the nonresponder allele in monocytes of \"nonresponder\" individuals, appeared to be responsible for the lack of proliferation observed. In cooperation with the IVth International Conference on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens, we analyzed CDw32 mAb to determine if they could distinguish the responder and nonresponder forms of Fc gamma RII. We report that mAb 41H16 binds preferentially to the responder allotypic form of Fc gamma RII expressed on human monocytes. When quantitative flow cytometry is used to measure the binding of both mAb 41H16 (responder Fc gamma RII) and mAb IV.3 (all myeloid cell Fc gamma RII), we are able to subdivide the responder population into homozygous and heterozygous responders. In addition, mAb 41H16 blocks the binding of mAb IV.3 to monocytes and inhibits proliferation when added to cells before addition of mAb Leu 4. We also show that polymorphonuclear leukocytes and platelets have the same allotypic differences in the binding of 41H16 as do monocytes. However, a subset of lymphocytes (previously shown to be B cells) expresses the 41H16 epitope with no evidence for donor to donor variability.\r"

The results show that a purified preparation of MHC class II molecules can sequentially bind, release, and rebind peptide, indicating that, in principle, MHC class II molecules could be used more than once for peptide binding. However, the time and pH required for peptide-MHC dissociation suggests that, in an Ag presenting cell, either a prolonged residence in an acidic compartment or other factors will be required for regeneration of the peptide binding site.\r"

One unique aspect of cyt c as an immunogen is its ability to induce autoantibody responses in animal models, although no pathology resulting from these responses has been reported. In this study, the presence and specificity of autoantibodies to cyt c were investigated in patients with SLE and related connective tissue diseases. Anti-cyt c antibodies were found in approximately 7% of patient sera and were statistically associated with the expression of antimitochondrial antibodies but were not statistically associated with any disease subset among those represented. Anti-cyt c was not associated with the presence of autoantibodies to DNA, histones, Ro, La, or Sm autoantigens. Most of the autoantibodies were specific for native or native-like forms of cyt c but antibodies to denatured forms were also apparent. Autoantibody binding was shown to be directed predominantly at selected sites of evolutionary variability within cyt c. The specificity of the human anti-cyt c autoantibodies appear to be similar to that of mouse anti-human cyt c antibodies and to autoantibodies elicited in mice against rat (mouse) cyt c.\r"

The structural characterization of Mo3 has been made possible by the development of a mAb (anti-Mo3f) that immunoprecipitates Mo3 from Nonidet P-40 lysates of radiolabeled PMA-stimulated U-937 cells and LPS-activated monocytes. On SDS-PAGE (nonreducing conditions) of anti-Mo3f immunoprecipitates, U-937 Mo3 is a single broad band of 39 to 66 kDa, whereas monocyte Mo3 is smaller with an apparent molecular mass of 32 to 56 kDa. Under reducing conditions, there is an increase in the m.w. of both species of Mo3 suggesting the existence of internal disulfide bonds. Mo3 is a glycoprotein with carbohydrate of the N-linked complex type as evidence by a reduction in m.w. by 40 to 50% after treatment with endoglycosidase F or N-glycanase; neuraminidase treatment produces a 3-kDa reduction in m.w. Deglycosylated Mo3 isolated from U-937 and monocytes have similar m.w. suggesting that the molecular heterogeneity of the native Mo3 may be due to differences in glycosylation. Mo3 is sensitive to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C with the release of native Mo3 from the surface of PMA-stimulated U-937 cells. These results indicate that Mo3 is a member of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked family of surface glycoproteins.\r"

In this investigation, we report that highly purified HLA-DR (DR) molecules in detergent solution are capable of binding a synthetic peptide (HAp) derived from the influenza hemagglutinin sequence. Although the presentation of this peptide has been demonstrated only to DR1-restricted Th cells, the association rate constants for the formation of HAp-DR1, -DR5, and -DR8 complexes were essentially identical (ka = 1.1 x 10(2) to 1.6 x 10(2) M-1 s-1). By contrast, the value of the rate constants for the dissociation of preformed HAp-DR1, -DR5, and -DR8 complexes varied nearly threefold (kd = 1.6 x 10(6) to 4.4 x 10(-6) s-1). The value of the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) derived from these rate constants were 13 nM, 24 nM, and 28 nM, for HAp-DR1, -DR5, and -DR8 complexes, respectively. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that the KD obtained from the rate constants for the HAp-DR1 reaction was in excellent agreement with that obtained under equilibrium conditions. SDS-PAGE confirmed that the HAp-DR complexes were remarkably stable, as HAp remained associated with the DR alpha beta heterodimer after treatment of the complexes with SDS and beta-mercaptoethanol. Steady-state binding studies demonstrated that 18% of all DR1 molecules had bound HAp at equilibrium, whereas only 3.8% of all DR8 molecules had bound HAp under identical conditions. The slight differences in the KD for HAp-DR complexes suggest that differences in the affinity of a peptide for DR alleles alone may not always explain the process of MHC restriction.\r"

  ".W": "Profile and quantity of leukotriene (LT) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) generation upon selective stimulation of isolated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) compared with neutrophils in a model of pulmonary leukostasis were investigated. Freshly prepared human PMN (2 x 10(8) were injected into the pulmonary artery of isolated, ventilated, and bloodfree perfused rabbit lungs, resulting in nearly quantitative sticking in the microvasculature. The sequestered neutrophils and, in parallel, aliquots of isolated PMN were stimulated with mAb in the presence of C, known to activate PMN arachidonate metabolism via formation of membrane attack complexes. In the isolated cells, a typical LT profile including LTB4 and its omega-oxidation products, 5-HETE and nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of LTA4 was evoked. The latter indicate secretion of LTA4 in considerable amounts. In the model of pulmonary leukostasis, no nonenzymatic LTA4-derivatives were detected, coincident with a predominance of cysteinyl-LT. This finding gives indirect evidence for an efficient LTA4-transfer between PMN feeder cells and vascular acceptor cells with glutathione-S-transferase activity. Moreover, a threefold increase in the total amount of LTA4-derived products was noted in the model of leukostasis, paralleled by a marked decrease in 5-HETE liberation. This effect was further enhanced by inhibition of lung cyclooxygenase. These findings were corroborated in a homologous system, in which rabbit PMN, sticking in the rabbit lung microvasculature, were stimulated with calcium-ionophore A23187. Collectively, these data suggest a complex interaction between microvascular tissue and adhering neutrophils in LT synthesis, involving transcellular LTA4-shift, modulation of the PMN 5-lipoxygenase pathway, and amplification of LT generation. These findings may be relevant for inflammatory events with neutrophils involved.\r"

  ".W": "Mononuclear phagocytes regulate the generation of plasmin by secreting urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2). We investigated the production of plasminogen activator (PA) and PA inhibitor by the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. Similar to U937 monoblast-like cells and peripheral blood monocytes (PBM), THP-1 cells produce a PA that is specifically neutralized by anti-uPA antibody and comigrates with human high molecular mass uPA (54 kDa) on casein-plasminogen zymogaphy. PA activity could be dissociated from intact THP-1 cells by brief treatment with a weak acid-glycine buffer, indicating that the uPA is secreted and bound to receptors on the plasma membrane. Regulation of uPA proceeds normally in THP-1 cells, with cell-associated PA activity increasing from 77 +/- 20 to 163 +/- 26 and 325 +/- 30 mPU/10(6) cells in response to PMA and LPS, respectively; parallel increases in steady state levels of uPA mRNA were observed. In contrast to normal expression of uPA activity, functional PAI-2 could not be demonstrated in either the conditioned media or cell lysates of THP-1 under basal or stimulated conditions. Both U937 and PBM secrete low levels of PA inhibitor activity that increase substantially in response to stimulation with PMA and LPS. Immunoreactive PAI-2, measured by ELISA, was undetectable in THP-1 lysates or conditioned medium, but was consistently present in U937 and PBM, paralleling the presence of PA inhibitor activity. THP-1 cells express low levels of an abnormally sized mRNA for PAI-2 and demonstrate a regulatory defect whereby steady state levels of PAI-2 mRNA are markedly reduced upon stimulation with PMA or LPS. By contrast, U937 and PBM respond to identical stimulation with increases in PAI-2 mRNA. We conclude that THP-1 cells express a structurally abnormal species of PAI-2 mRNA, with complete loss of inhibitory activity as well as altered function of PMA- and LPS-responsive regulatory elements.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of phospholipase D (PLD) to the production of phosphatidic acid (PA) and diglyceride (DG) by C5a-stimulated human neutrophils has been studied. Membrane-associated 1-O-alkyl-phosphatidylcholine (alkyl-PC) was double labeled with 3H and 32P by incubating neutrophils with [3H]alkyl-lysoPC and alkyl-[32P]lysoPC. Upon stimulation with recombinant C5a, these labeled neutrophils produce 1-O-alkyl-phosphatidic acid (alkyl-PA) and, in the presence of ethanol, 1-O-alkyl-phosphatidyl-ethanol (alkyl-PEt), containing both 3H and 32P. Formation of radiolabeled alkyl-PEt parallels that of radiolabeled alkyl-PA and requires both extracellular Ca2+ and cytochalasin B. Furthermore, the 3H/32P ratios of alkyl-PA and alkyl-PEt formed during stimulation are very similar to that of th substrate alkyl-PC. These results demonstrate that, in C5a-stimulated neutrophils, alkyl-PA and alkyl-PEt are formed from alkyl-PC almost exclusively by PLD-catalyzed hydrolysis and transphosphatidylation, respectively. Upon C5a stimulation, neutrophils labeled with 3H and 32P also produce 1-O-[3H]alkyl-diglyceride [( 3H]alkyl-DG) and [32P]orthophosphate [( 32P]PO4), but not [32P]phosphocholine. [3H]Alkyl-DG and [32P]PO4 are formed in parallel, although temporally lagging behind alkyl-PA. Propranolol, a PA phosphohydrolase (PPH) inhibitor, decreases the formation of both [3H]alkyl-DG and [32P]PO4, although increasing alkyl-PA accumulation. These data support the conclusion that alkyl-DG is formed from alkyl-PC by the combined activities of PLD and PPH and not by phospholipase C (PLC). Furthermore, by using [3H]acyl-PC-labeled neutrophils, it is demonstrated that, like alkyl-PC, 1-acyl-PC is also degraded sequentially by PLD and PPH to 1-acyl-DG. Propranolol does not inhibit phosphoinositide-specific PLC and yet it causes almost complete inhibition of the total DG mass accumulation in C5a-stimulated neutrophils. We conclude that, in cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils stimulated with C5a, PLD-catalyzed hydrolysis of PC determines the levels of both PA and DG with potentially important ramifications for neutrophil-mediated defense functions.\r"

  ".U": "90171588\r", 
  ".W": "Three protein kinase C (PKC) activators (PMA, mezerein, and a diacylglycerol) had bidirectional effects on human polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) degranulation responses to leukotriene (LT) B4. Lower concentrations of the three agents enhanced, whereas higher concentrations inhibited, release of lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase stimulated by the arachidonic acid metabolite. Contrastingly, the activators inhibited but never enhanced LTB4-induced Ca2+ transients. We examined the causes for these varying effects. Each PKC activator reduced PMN specific binding of [3H]LTB4. Scatchard analyses revealed that PMA (greater than or equal to 0.16 nM) decreased the number of high affinity LTB4 receptors. The receptor losses correlated closely with inhibition of Ca2+ transients. PMN pretreated with 0.5 nM PMA for 5 min retained approximately 50% of their high affinity LTB4 receptors. These cells responded to 10 nM LTB4 with reduced but still substantial rises in cytosolic Ca2+, enhanced PKC mobilization, and increased granule enzyme release. The latter two effects appeared calcium-dependent because sequential exposure to PMA and LTB4 did not synergistically stimulate PKC mobilization or degranulation in PMN that were: 1) Ca2(+)-depleted; 2) challenged with 5 nM PMA; or 3) treated with LTB4 for 5 min before PMA. Each of the latter treatments completely interfered with the extent or timing of LTB4-induced Ca2+ transients. Accordingly, we suggest that the response-specific, bidirectional effects of PKC activators on LTB4 result from two opposing mechanisms. First, PKC activators down-regulate LTB4 high affinity receptors and thereby reduce those PMN responses that are not elicited by activated PKC (i.e., Ca2+ transients). Second, LTB4, by elevating cytosolic Ca2+, increases the amount of PKC mobilized by PKC activators and thereby promotes PKC-dependent responses (e.g., degranulation). The two mechanisms may be pertinent to the bidirectional effects of PKC activators on various other agonists. Furthermore, PKC, by down-regulating receptors, may serve as a physiologic stop signal for terminating function and producing a poststimulatory state of desensitization.\r"

Viral replication is inhibited very early in the cycle, prior to the onset of alpha-protein synthesis; no viral protein or DNA synthesis is detectable even up to 1 week later. The enhanced expression of two 62-kDa and 57-kDa cellular proteins, however, is induced in the lymphocyte population within 3 to 5 h after infection. A 30-kDa protein is induced in the monocyte population immediately after infection. The induced expression of 62-kDa and 57-kDa lymphocyte proteins appears to be virus-mediated because: a) HSV and pseudorabies virus (although not vaccinia virus) induce the expression of 62-kDa and 57-kDa proteins, b) heat shock or exposure of lymphocytes to uninfected cell extracts does not induce expression of either protein, c) 62-kDa protein is not induced in lymphocytes stimulated with a mitogenic concentration of PHA. UV-inactivated HSV induces expression of 62-kDa and 57-kDa proteins in a manner similar to that observed with untreated virus. In contrast, expression of 30-kDa monocyte protein is induced nonspecifically by either uninfected cell extracts or cell extracts containing virus. Sixty-two-kilodalton and 57-kDa protein induction appears to be a marker for human lymphocytes that express profound intracellular resistance to infection with HSV. Induced expression of these proteins occurs only in lymphocytes that inhibit viral replication very early in the growth cycle, prior to the onset of alpha-protein synthesis. Expression of 62-kDa and 57-kDa proteins is not induced in lymphocytes that are permissive or partially permissive to infection with HSV.\r"

Inasmuch as this region normally exhibits considerable sequence variability, the identity displayed by the antibodies indicates a requirement for this particular sequence in the generation of their specificity for the GA733 antigen. Moreover, this homology suggests that the antibodies recognize a common determinant on the Ag, and that the polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies can functionally mimic the Ag at the level of the structure of the Ag-specific antibody that is induced.\r"

  ".W": "The murine CR genes Crry (previously termed mCRY) and Crry-ps (previously termed mCRX) are two distinct, but related, sequences which are the evolutionary homologs to sequences contained within the human CR1 gene. Screening a BALB/c genomic DNA library with the Crry/Crry-ps specific cDNA resulted in the isolation of two clusters of genomic sequences: those specific for Crry and those specific for Crry-ps. The coding sequences of the Crry gene encompass over 25 kb of DNA, whereas the Crry-ps sequences are included within a single 5.6-kb Eco-R1 fragment. The Crry gene consists of 10 separate exons. The first of these contains both the signal sequence and an alternatively spliced 129 bp present in approximately 10% of the Crry transcripts. Of the remaining exons, two encode a single sixty amino acid repeat domain each (A and E), two encode a split sixty amino acid repeat (B), and another encodes two 60 amino acid domains (C and D) fused as one exon. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions are both split into two exons each. RNA protection analysis indicates that although there is alternative splicing in the 5' region of the gene, the 3' exons encoding the terminal 60 amino acid repeat, the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic exons are used in the same order in all Crry transcripts. This suggests that the Crry gene product is not found as a secreted protein, but only as a cell surface bound protein. DNA sequence analysis of the Crry-ps gene indicates that this sequence most likely represents a pseudogene resulting from a processed mRNA transcript from the Crry gene. This conclusion is based on the lack of intervening sequences in the Crry-ps gene and the observation that the Crry-ps gene sequence contains both an 11-bp deletion within the \"coding\" region and a degenerate poly A tail at the 3' end of the homologous sequence. Additionally, RNA protection analysis indicates that mRNA cannot be detected which matches the Crry-ps sequence.\r"

The cDNA clone is 1102 bp and contains a complete open reading frame with an AUG start codon and a TAA stop codon. The open reading frame translates into a protein of 248 amino acids that has one glycosylation site. The characteristic N-terminal Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly and the His, Asp, and Ser amino acid residues that form the catalytic triad of serine proteases are present. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences have 87 and 80% identity, respectively, with the murine CTL-specific serine protease CCPI. However, there are extensive differences in the substrate binding regions of these proteases. Comparison of hydropathic profiles and amino acid sequences of other proteases indicate that RNKP-1 is distinct and belongs to the subfamily of serine proteases of bone marrow origin. Northern blot analysis of poly A+ RNA from rat splenocytes cultured with Con A showed 1000 and 1400 nucleotide mRNA are detected with RNKP-1 after 1 day of Con A-stimulation. The expression of the two mRNA bands continues through day 5 of culture with the lectin and may represent RNKP-1 mRNA plus related sequences due to cross-hybridization. RNKP-1 is also expressed in RNK-16 cells, but is not expressed in freshly isolated rat splenocytes, brain, lung, or lymph node tissues. The induction of RNKP-1 expression in the Con A-cultured spleen cells is accompanied by increases in both NK and lymphokine-activated killer lymphocyte activities. These data indicate that RNKP-1 is a unique serine protease that may be preferentially expressed in NK cells.\r"

However, while UVB impairs the induction of CH in some strains of mice, it has no apparent effect on CH in others. Thus, a disparity exists between the effects of UVB on LC and on CH. This is a paradox because LC are generally regarded to serve as the antigen-presenting cells of the skin, placing them at the earliest stages of induction of CH. One possible explanation for this paradox has been that UVB-susceptible strains of mice may generate hapten-specific suppressor T cells, whereas their UVB-resistant counterparts may not, when their skin is treated with UVR and painted with haptens such as dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). This possibility was excluded by examining the capacity of UVR and hapten to generate suppressor T cells in several different inbred strains of mice. The results indicate that the induction of hapten-specific afferent T suppressor cells is a universal sequela to treatment of mice with UVB and hapten, irrespective of whether the mice display the phenotype of vigorous CH or not. Thus, the genetic basis of UVB-resistance does not reside in the ability of UVR to induce suppressor T cells. Rather, attention should now be focused on its ability to interrupt induction of effector mechanisms.\r"

The aim of the present work was to study women with persistent acne and without other evidence of hyperandrogenism, such as hirsutism, alopecia, or irregular menses. Among 87 female patients with acne and/or hirsutism, we defined three groups: group 1 (n = 29), patients having treatment-resistant acne without menstrual disturbance, alopecia, or hirsutism; group 2 (n = 27), patients with acne and hirsutism; and group 3 (n = 31), patients with hirsutism alone. Clinical chemistry criteria for hyperandrogenism were based on elevated values of one or more of the following parameters: plasma testosterone, delta-4-androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, urinary 5 alpha-androstane 3 alpha-17 beta-diol, and 17-ketosteroids (with chromatography). Plasma and urine samples were drawn between the 18th and 25th days of the cycle. Among group 1 patients, we found 25 subjects (86%) with hyperandrogenism, according to these laboratory criteria. The etiologies were: polycystic ovary syndrome (36%), adrenal hypersecretion (40%, of which 12% showed secondary polycystic ovaries), isolated increase in 5 alpha-androstane 3 alpha-17 beta-diol (20%), and hyperandrogenism without diagnosis (4%). The parameters were found to be more elevated in these patients than in a control group of 30 normal volunteer women. In groups 2 and 3, the findings were essentially the same as in group 1, except for increased levels of testosterone and the testosterone/SHBG ratio. Furthermore, it was evident that persistent acne may be an isolated sign of hyperandrogenism.\r"

  ".W": "Fibrillin, a 350-kD glycoprotein, was recently localized to elastin-associated 10 nm microfibrils. Here, the distribution of fibrillin immunoreactivity was determined in normal skin in individuals of different ages and in lesions of solar elastosis or anetoderma. It was compared with the distribution of orcein-stainable fibers and with the immunoreactivities of vitronectin and amyloid P component. These glycoproteins are known to occur in conjunction with the orcein-stainable elastic fibers in adults, but not in the young. Fibrillin immunoreactivity was associated with orcein-stainable fibers in normal skin of both adults and the young. In addition, the fibrillin immunoreactive fiber network comprised fine fibers that were unstainable by orcein, anti-vitronectin, or anti-amyloid P component. Such fine fibers were especially abundant close to the dermal-epidermal junction zone. Immunoreactivities of anti-vitronectin and anti-amyloid P component were not always associated with fibrillin immunoreactivity but were consistently found to co-localize with orcein-stainable fibers in adults. This suggests vitronectin and amyloid P component to be associated with the amorphous elastin rather than with the microfibrils, although alternative interpretations are possible. In elastotic lesions, fibrillin immunoreactivity was generally fainter than that obtained using anti-vitronectin or anti-amyloid P component. In contrast, an extensive network of dermal fibers stained by anti-fibrillin, but not by anti-amyloid P component, anti-vitronectin, or orcein, was seen in an anetoderma lesion. In conclusion, fibrillin immunoreactivity is associated with a unique dermal network, which ultrastructurally is composed of microfibrils. These fibers are proposed to have an important structural and functional role in anchoring the dermal elastic fibers in the extracellular matrix and to the lamina densa.\r"

  ".W": "The hair follicle provides an excellent system in which to study growth and differentiation. Hair keratins are useful tissue-specific molecular markers for these events. By comparing a second mouse Type I hair keratin cDNA clone, MHKA-2, with our previously described MHKA-1, we have been able to contrast the nucleotide sequences and corresponding deduced amino acid sequences of the smallest (mHa4) and the largest (mHa1) major Type I hair keratins. Both nucleotide sequences and both deduced amino acid sequences share high identity but have distinct segments suitable for generation of specific molecular probes. Comparison of amino acid sequences adjacent to the central helical domains has demonstrated homologous subdomains, designated H1 and H2, in the Type I hair keratin nonhelical termini. Although there is only 56% amino acid identity in the carboxy-terminal nonhelical domains, a common sequence, T-------CGPC----R, has been identified in this domain, suggesting a possible common functional role for this portion of the molecule. In addition, it appears that mHa4 may differ in part from mHa1 by deletion of a segment between the H2 subdomain and the conserved sequence. Staining of mouse and human hair follicles with AmHa1, a monospecific polyclonal antibody for mHa1, and AE13, an antibody specific for all Type I hair keratins, suggests differential expression of individual Type I hair keratins in both species. This supports our hypothesis that distinct functional requirements are satisfied by the multiplicity of hair keratins.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of both 125I-labeled plasminogen activator binding analysis and transmission electron microscopy studies of the interaction of a plasminogen activator/gold complex with cell membranes, we have found that human keratinocytes have specific receptors for human urokinase-type plasminogen activator distributed on the cell surface as singlets, or as small or large clusters. The use in binding experiments of the purified A chain of urokinase-plasminogen activator and of anti-A chain monoclonal antibodies has indicated that cell receptors are specific for a sequence present on the A chain, as previously reported for other cells. The interaction of both the native molecule and the purified A chain with such receptors stimulates mobilization of keratinocytes in an in vitro cell model system (Boyden chamber), when present in the lower compartment of the migration apparatus in nanomolar concentrations. Preincubation of chemoattractants with a monoclonal antibody which prevents receptor/ligand interaction also prevents plasminogen activator-induced cell migration. These data suggest that, under the conditions used in this in vitro model system, the plasminogen activator-dependent mobilization of keratinocytes depends on the interaction of the ligand with free receptors on the cell surface, and is independent of plasmin generation.\r"

The method is based on the measurement of the two nonradioactive isotopes of copper (i.e., 63Cu and 65Cu) in rat hair by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Sodium, known to cause interferences in ICP-MS analyses, was removed by using an ion-exchange procedure. Correlation between the diet and hair element concentration levels have been reported. Controversy in the literature exists about the validity of elemental analyses of hair because elements may be incorporated in hair from the diet and body stores during growth, as well as from environmental sources. Tracing dietary elements in hair during growth would eliminate the uncertainness of this procedure. In nature, copper exists as 69.174 atom % 63Cu and 30.826 atom % 65Cu expressed as the 63Cu/65Cu ratio of 2.2400. Enriched (99.61 atom %) 65Cu was obtained and used to label the dietary source of copper. Data showed that 50% of the copper in the rat hair of rats gavaged with the enriched 65Cu isotope was due to 65Cu and 50% was natural isotope-abundant copper.\r"

Several, but not all, Pv sera reacted with similar antigens in both a bovine muzzle desmosome preparation and extract of cultured human squamous carcinoma cells. On the other hand, some pemphigus foliaceus (Pf) sera exhibited reactivity with a 150-kD protein, which is most likely desmoglein I, in both the human epidermal extract and the bovine desmosome preparation, but no Pf serum reacted with this antigen in the squamous carcinoma cell extract. Furthermore, 4/16 Pv sera also reacted with a 150-kD protein in the desmosome preparation, which seemed to be the same as Pf antigen. These results show a relationship between antigens of both Pf and Pv and desmosomes, as well as heterogeneities of both Pv and Pf antigens in terms of antigenic molecules or epitopes. Furthermore, this study presents the possibility that immunoblot analysis can be routinely used for differentiation of Pv and Pf antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "This in vitro study aimed at substantial modification of the freeze-fracture replication technique (FFRT) which should result in an optimal visualization of the ultrastructure of human skin. The technique was modified in two ways: firstly, the conventional sample holders such as gold cups and copper plates were replaced by silver cylinders (83.5% silver, 16.5% copper) resulting in almost perpendicular cross fractures through the skin. Secondly, the replica cleaning procedure was optimized through the following sequence of treatments. Firstly, a mild tissue destruction was obtained by simultaneous lipid solvation and water extraction with absolute methanol (20 h), followed by protein denaturation with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 24 h). Subsequently, a final treatment was given using an alkaline sodium hypochlorite solution (20% KOH/13% NaClO; 1:3 v/v, 4 d). After rinsing the replicas for 45 min in aqua bidest, they were mounted on copper grids and examined in the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The combination of the unorthodox fracturing method and the optimized cleaning procedure yielded large, practically undamaged and very clean replicas of near perpendicular cross fractures through human skin. Common handicaps related to current freeze-fracture procedures when applied to skin, such as incomplete cleaning and fragmentation of replicas and oblique or irregular fracturing planes, can largely be avoided in this way. In this paper a complete description of the method is given, and a number of advantages are illustrated with the aid of TEM micrographs.\r"

The wheal and flare responses to histamine are linearly related to dose over a wide range of stimulus strengths (r = 0.88). In summer, wheal responses were smaller, probably due to increased thickness of the epidermis. Female subjects generally expressed larger wheal responses than males, presumably due to differences in epidermal thickness and structure. There were significant regional differences in wheal, flare, and laser Doppler recorded flux responses. Ratings of itch sensations also showed clear, but less pronounced, differences of body regions. Significant regional differences of wheal and flare responses existed. Sensory discrimination of different stimulus levels was demonstrated with visual analogue scale ratings.\r"

An increased number of fibroblasts showing clearly detectable expression of pro alpha 1(I)collagen gene was found in all fibrotic lesions when compared with unaffected skin from the patient with DF and skin from two normal individuals examined in parallel. Expression of the TGF beta 1 gene was noted in a fibroblast subpopulation of the affected tissues from the patients with DF and GM. In contrast, the TGF beta 1 gene was not expressed at a detectable level in affected skin from the five patients with PSS. The results suggest that TGF beta 1 may play a role in the development of skin fibrosis in cases of DF and GM. However, from these studies, we cannot implicate TGF beta 1 in the pathogenesis of skin fibrosis in PSS.\r"

Overall, black infants had significantly higher rates of low birthweight than white infants. Black infants served by civilian medical care had approximately twice the neonatal mortality of white infants; however, black infants born in the military hospital had a neonatal mortality rate comparable to white infants. Controlling for marital status, age, parity, and income status did not appreciably change these patterns. Military care appeared to be associated with a protective effect for neonatal mortality for blacks. This effect was not due to differences in birthweight distribution or to the quantity of prenatal care received. The effect was most prominent for normal weight black infants, especially for those from low-income census tracts. The findings have possible implications for pediatric access issues for the poor and for the family practice model of perinatal care continuity.\r"

  ".W": "Athletic preparticipation evaluations are among the most common routine health screening tools, yet no standardized approach to these evaluations has been adopted. This paper presents a focused preparticipation examination form developed by the authors with the assistance of the North Carolina Academy of Family Physicians' Task Force on Sports Medicine. After reviewing the major studies of preparticipation examinations, 11 basic questions that identify specific risks for sports participation were selected. Three specific components form the core of the physical examination: blood pressure measurement, a comprehensive orthopedic examination, and cardiovascular auscultation. Other portions of the physical examination may be included because of sport-specific risks or problems identified in the history, but are not routine. The rationale for this form and guidelines for the physician to make recommendations for sports participation and timing of reevaluation are discussed.\r"

This study used an attitude-behavior model as a guiding framework to identify beliefs, sources of influence, facilitating conditions, and critical events that may be important determinants of physicians' rates for providing eight cancer control activities. Open-ended, semistructured interviews were conducted with 26 family physicians to discuss the factors that may have affected their policies for providing each of the eight cancer control activities. Content analysis of those interviews produced unique lists of beliefs, sources of influence, facilitating conditions, and critical events for each activity. These lists of factors are more comprehensive than those identified in previous studies. A questionnaire has been developed based on these findings, and a validation study is being conducted to identify the factors that best explain variation in rates at which cancer control activities are performed.\r"

One important feature of this interaction is provider concern for psychosocial issues. A study was undertaken to examine provider's actions with the patient and to describe the factors influencing the provider's concern with psychosocial issues. A total of 412 provider-patient clinic visits, including 276 with physicians and 136 with nurse practitioners, were videotaped and analyzed using a provider psychosocial concern index developed specifically for this study. Data from exit and follow-up interviews with patients plus a provider questionnaire were analyzed to identify factors associated with a provider's psychosocial concern. The results show that an interactional analysis focusing on clinician activities can be useful in describing important process-outcome relationships such as psychosocial concern. Factors such as type of visit, visit history, type of provider, and sex of patient and provider were associated with the amount of psychosocial concern displayed by providers and perceived by patients.\r"

The proportion of residency-trained family physicians who provide maternity care at the initiation of their careers and the proportion who have given up maternity care are nearly identical in the United States and Canada. Both studies found that about one half of the family physicians who currently provide maternity care were giving consideration to stopping. The reasons underlying this withdrawal were multifactorial. Malpractice issues were the predominant concern of United States family physicians, but the data from the studies indicate that other issues, such as interference with lifestyle and office practice and the effect of attitudes of obstetricians, should not be overlooked.\r"

U.S.-born Mexican Americans had higher depression scores than those born in Mexico. When cultural and social psychological variables were controlled in a multiple regression analysis, the immigrant status difference persisted. Tests of interaction terms suggested greater vulnerability to the effects of low acculturation and low educational attainment among the U.S.-born relative to those born in Mexico; however, the immigrant status difference persisted after controlling for these interactions. Unmeasured variables such as selective migration of persons with better coping skills, selective return of depressed immigrants, or generational differences in social comparison processes may account for the immigration status difference.\r"

Generalized social phobics were younger, less educated, and less likely to be employed, and their phobias were rated by clinical interviewers as more severe than those of public speaking phobics. Generalized social phobics appeared more anxious and more depressed and expressed greater fears concerning negative social evaluation. They performed more poorly on individualized behavioral tests and differed from public speaking phobics in their responses to cognitive assessment tasks. The two groups showed marked differences in their patterns of heart rate acceleration during the behavioral test.

In addition, prior studies have been marred by the absence of appropriate contrast groups. The present investigation compared the lifetime prevalence of panic attacks and panic-related disorders diagnosed according to DSM-III criteria in a group of 79 alcohol-dependent patients, 64 depressed patients, and 70 nonclinical subjects. Panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia with panic attacks were more prevalent in the alcohol-dependent and depressed samples than among nonclinical subjects. Men in both clinical samples were more likely than women to have had nonagoraphobic panic disorder, but male alcoholics were less likely to have developed agoraphobia than were female alcoholics or depressed patients of either sex. No consistent chronological relationship between onset of panic attacks and alcohol abuse was found. Results indicate that there is an unusually high prevalence of panic attacks and panic-related disorders among alcoholics, but comparable prevalence rates can be found in depressed and perhaps some other psychiatric populations. Implications for the assessment and treatment of alcohol-dependent and panic-disordered patients are discussed.\r"

Schizotypal subjects (those with a 2-7-8 or an 8-9 MMPI profile type) were compared with \"psychiatric\" control subjects (those with a spike 9 or a 4-9 profile type) and normal control subjects. Group differences were expected only in the transient-facilitating, LSF masking condition in this study's assessment of the hypothesis that a transient channel abnormality underlies the schizophrenia spectrum backward masking deficit. As predicted, schizotypal subjects displayed greater masking susceptibility in the LSF transient-facilitating condition as compared with the HSF, sustained-facilitating condition that produced no group differences. These results suggest that multichannel neurophysiological models of masking may help to direct research designed to gain an increased understanding of the specific nature of the spectrum masking deficit.\r"

The most common PDs were antisocial, borderline, and schizotypal, whereas the most common according to the MCMI-I were dependent, narcissistic, and avoidant. Both instruments indicated that multiple PD diagnoses were common. Paranoid and schizotypal traits were found to be ubiquitous across instruments.

The study focussed upon the role of glial cells in the pathogenesis of demyelination. In acute MS, demyelination involved the vesicular dissolution of myelin from intact axons and a paucity of fibrillary astrogliosis. Foamy macrophages, many of them probably derived from transformed and recently proliferated microglia, contained recognizable myelin debris and lipid droplets and were abundant throughout the lesions. These cells formed the major phagocytic population and stained positively for class II major histocompatibility complex antigens (HLA-DR; Ia). In acute MS lesions, rounded astrocytes were encountered which possessed membrane-bound compartments enclosing phagocytosed fragments of myelin basic protein-positive debris. Despite the superficial resemblance of these cells to foamy macrophages, the presence of intermediate filaments, glycogen granules and diffuse glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity supported an astroglial identity. Astrocyte processes were involved in myelin removal and invested recently demyelinated axons. Hypertrophic fibrous astrocytes were common in chronic active lesions, were capable of myelin degradation and on occasion, contained myelin debris attached to clathrin-coated pits. These astrocytes were sometimes Ia+. Oligodendrocytes were depleted from the center of active lesions but were numerous at the lesion margin, suggesting survival and proliferation. They stained positively for myelin-associated glycoprotein, a marker for immature oligodendrocytes. However, they were invariably Ia-. The findings confirm and further support a role for the astrocyte as both an antigen presenting cell and a phagocyte in the CNS during MS.\r"

Ultrastructural examination of the acute phase of guanethidine-induced neuronal degeneration in the superior cervical ganglion demonstrated a prominent lymphocytic infiltrate in the ganglionic parenchyma and perivascular spaces. Within the satelliting cell sheath there were lymphocytes with delicate processes in intimate contact with abnormal or degenerating principal sympathetic neurons. The lymphocytic infiltrate and early evidence of neuronal degeneration developed within three days of onset of treatment and reached a maximum on the 7th day. Immunocytochemical studies of the ganglion demonstrated that the mononuclear infiltrate was composed primarily of CD-8 positive, OX-19 negative lymphocytes, which may represent a natural killer (NK) or NK-like effector cell, as well as scattered monocytes and macrophages. Guanethidine showed little effect on the prevertebral (superior mesenteric and celiac) sympathetic ganglia compared to the paravertebral (superior cervical) chain ganglia of the same animals. Considerable rat strain selectivity was noted with Lewis and Sprague-Dawley strains showing a greater degree of neuronal destruction than Fischer 344 rats. Neonatal thymectomy failed to prevent neuronal degeneration and the lymphocytic infiltrate. These features of immune neuronal killing are not typical of a characterized antibody or T-lymphocyte mediated effector mechanism, but may represent a selective NK cell or NK-like cell mediated pathogenetic pathway. Guanethidine-induced neuronal destruction appears to be a unique type of drug-induced, cell-mediated, autoimmune attack on sympathetic neurons and may provide insight into autoimmune disorders and possibly into diseases characterized by selective neuronal degeneration.\r"

In this subset a shift in the distribution of certain pathological profiles had occurred in that the visual areas of the occipital and posterior parietal regions had an increased number of lesions, whereas the prefrontal cortex had fewer lesions than usually observed in AD. Previous quantitative analyses have shown that generally in AD, primary sensory cortical areas are less damaged than association areas of the frontal and temporal lobes, as demonstrated by the laminar and regional distribution of two neuropathological features of the disease, neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic (senile) plaques. The distribution of pathological lesions in the AD cases with Balint's syndrome revealed that specific visual association pathways were disrupted, which are normally spared in AD. These data suggest that in some cases of AD, the particular psychological and neurological symptomatology may be caused by the selective loss of specific corticocortical systems, as reflected in the differential distribution of the neuropathological markers of the disease.\r"

The tumors were either polyclonal, monoclonal, or multiclonal. Patients with congenital immunodeficiencies who developed these tumors died despite radiotherapy, corticosteroids plus acyclovir, or a combination of intravenous (IV) immunoglobulins and alpha 2 interferon. Patients with leukemia recovered when immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued and leukemia has not recurred over a period of 2 and 4 years, respectively, in the two patients.\r"

No responses were seen in 12 eligible patients. Myelosuppression was only occasionally seen. Other toxicities included diaphoresis, chest pain, local irritation at the injection site, arthralgias, nausea and vomiting, and neuromuscular problems. There were two early deaths, both attributable to tumor progression with resultant obstruction of a vital structure. Ten patients crossed over to alternate active therapy (etoposide [VP-16]-cisplatin) and five responded. The median survival time (MST) of the whole group of treated patients was 31 weeks. In future trials of investigational new drugs in previously untreated SCLC, we recommend that patients with the following characteristics be excluded: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2, 3, and 4; superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction; any major paraneoplastic syndrome; serious comorbid illness; and extensive hepatic involvement by tumor. The trial design should include prompt crossover to active alternative therapy, such as VP-16 and cisplatin, for disease progression or for failure to respond after two treatment cycles. Also, the trial design should use an early stopping rule based on interest in identifying only very active agents with a minimum response rate of 30%.\r"

  ".W": "Past attempts to subclassify small-cell lung cancer (SCCL) histology (oat cell, fusiform, polygonal, intermediate, etc) have not been useful because of interrater variability and a lack of clinical significance. A review of outcome in a previous series suggested that a different histologic subtype, small-cell/large-cell (SC/LC) conferred an inferior response and survival analogous to the relative chemotherapy and radiation resistance seen in the variant-morphology (SC/LC) cultured cell lines. To evaluate the clinical impact of SC/LC we applied the proposed International Association for the study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) histology subclassification that incorporates the SC/LC category for patients with extensive-disease SCCL entering Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) protocol 1582. All cases were reviewed for eligibility by one pathologist, and all possible SC/LC (variant) plus 10% of all cases were reviewed together with a second pathologist; 577 of the 628 patients who entered were eligible, of whom 550 had histologic material submitted for review and are considered for this analysis. Initial review disclosed 24 cases with SC/LC (4.4%) and 526 with \"classic\" histology. The second review showed 100% agreement for classic form, but only 11 SC/LC cases with concordance between the reviewing pathologists. Eight of 24 (33%) cases from first review and three of 11 (27%) with concordance on second review achieved complete response (CR) compared with 101 of 526 (19%) for \"classic\" SCCL (P = .11 and .45, respectively, for the first and second review groups).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90172013\r", 
  ".W": "The current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for bronchogenic carcinoma, which divides stage III M0 cases into stages IIIA and IIIB, is based on the observation that selected patients with IIIA disease (T3 or N2) can undergo complete surgical resection, in distinction to IIIB patients (T4 or N3). To understand the value of this system when applied to clinically staged (CS) patients treated with a standard nonoperative approach, the records of patients with squamous cell, large-cell, and adenocarcinoma of the lung treated with radiation therapy (RT) at the Fox Chase Cancer Center from 1978 to 1987 were reviewed. Three hundred sixteen patients were identified as having CS III M0 disease treated with single daily fraction RT without chemotherapy or sensitizers. Of these, the distinction between IIIA (166) and IIIB (140) could be made for 306 patients. The median survival time (MST) for all CS III patients was 9.6 months, and the 2-year survival was 17%. No difference was observed in MST between CS IIIA and IIIB patients (9.4 v 9.8 months, P = .78), in 2-year survival (17% v 18%), or in rate of first failure within the RT field (43% v 44%). MSTs for the 157 CS IIIA and IIIB patients with less than 5% weight loss and Zubrod performance status (PS) 0 to 1 were 13.0 and 15.8 months (P = .29), respectively. This lack of difference in outcome for CS IIIA and IIIB patients receiving RT has important implications in the design and stratification of future nonoperative trials for stage III lung cancer.\r"

For this purpose, reactivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) CLB-ERY3 (antiblood-group H antigen), VIM-D5 (CD15), WT1 (CD7), MY7 (CD13), MY9 (CD33), VID-1 (antihuman leukocyte antigen locus DR [anti-HLA DR]), VIM-2 (CDw65L), VIM-13 (CD14), 63D3 (CD14) and anti-TdT with leukemic blast cell populations was prospectively analyzed with respect to the rates of complete remission (CR), continuous complete remission (CCR), and survival. The overall rate of CR was 65%, the 6-year rates of overall CCR and survival were 23% and 13%, respectively (median period of patient observation, 30 months). Of all Abs tested, four (CLB-ERY3, MY7, anti-TdT, and VIM-D5) were found to be of prognostic value. Reactivity of CLB-ERY3, MY7, and anti-TdT was predictive for CR (CLB-ERY3+, 43% v CLB-ERY3-, 73%, P less than .02; MY7+, 59% v MY7-, 91%, P less than .003; TdT+, 28% v TdT-, 71%, P less than .001, respectively) and probability of survival (significantly lower survival rates: CLB-ERY3+, P less than .02; MY7+, P less than .03; and TdT+ cases, P less than .001, respectively). Reactivity of VIM-D5 was significantly associated with a higher probability of CCR (P less than .01). Our results confirm earlier reports on the prognostic significance of expression of CD13 and TdT in AML and indicate CLB-ERY3 (antiblood-group H antibody) and VIM-D5 (CD15) as further markers predictive for the clinical outcome in patients with de novo AML.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes were examined in the lymphoblasts of 70 children with immunophenotypically defined B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The most frequent genes to rearrange were Ig heavy (H) chain (93%) and TCR delta (79%), followed by TCR gamma (49%), Ig kappa and/or lambda light (L) chain (46%), TCR alpha (46%), and TCR beta (29%). Thus, despite their putative \"B-cell precursor\" lineage, these leukemias manifest a remarkably high incidence of TCR gene rearrangements. While certain patterns predominate, there is considerable heterogeneity in Ig and TCR genotypes in this disease. No significant associations were found between Ig and TCR genotype and commonly used prognostic factors including age, sex, race, WBC, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, or cytogenetics. However, the lymphoblasts of three of six patients who failed to achieve initial remission had germline patterns of every Ig and TCR gene, a genotype not observed in the leukemic cells from any of the 64 patients who achieved complete remission (p2 = .0007). This study suggests that particular Ig and TCR genotypes may be of clinical relevance in childhood B-cell precursor ALL. The finding of rearranged TCR genes in a large proportion of cases raises fundamental questions about early lineage commitment and lymphocyte differentiation along B-cell and T-cell pathways.\r"

In addition, the records of all pediatric oncology patients who received high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) chemotherapy were reviewed. Gram-positive organisms accounted for 82.6% of the septicemic episodes. In the total group, coagulase-negative staphylococci and viridans streptococci accounted for 35.8% and 28.4% of the episodes, respectively. In granulocytopenic patients, viridans streptococci were the most common pathogens (36.8%). In the subset of patients who received HDAC, 62.5% of the septicemic episodes were caused by viridans streptococci. Pulmonary complications developed in nine (29%) of the total cases of viridans streptococcal sepsis, whereas these complications occurred in only eight (10.3%) of the septic episodes caused by other organisms. In patients who had viridans septicemia, prior treatment with HDAC did not increase the incidence of pulmonary complications. In septic children with malignancy, our results demonstrate a high incidence of gram-positive organisms, including viridans streptococci, which were once regarded as culture contaminants.\r"

Serial scans showed tumor uptake of radioisotope in 12 of 16 patients receiving 131I-labeled 28A32 and in nine of 12 patients receiving 131I-labeled 16.88. No antitumor effects were seen with either antibody. No antibody-related toxic effects were observed following administration of 16.88, but two patients developed localized urticarial reactions following injection with antibody 28A32. No patient developed an antibody response to 16.88. Anti-28A32 reactivity was found in five of 12 (42%) normal sera and in seven of 23 (30%) patients before receiving any antibody. Following administration of 28A32, a low titer (1:10 dilution) of anti-28A32 developed in four patients with no preexisting antibody, a decrease in the preexisting titer was seen in three other patients, the titer remained constant in one patient, and no anti-28A32 was ever detected in six patients. In most cases, anti-28A32 activity was lost at dilutions greater than 1:10 and did not appear to affect antibody half-life in the serum or whole body retention of the antibody. We conclude that these human IgM MoAbs are capable of localizing at sites of disease in vivo, are nontoxic, and are poorly immunogenic in humans. Further studies to determine the specificity of targeting and to improve the delivery of antibody to sites of tumor are indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with Hodgkin's disease who have failed two or more chemotherapy regimens or who have relapsed after an initial chemotherapy-induced remission of less than 12 months are seldom cured with conventional salvage therapies. We studied the effect of high-dose cytoreductive therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation in 50 such patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease. Twenty-one patients with histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA)-matched donors had allogeneic marrow transplants, one patient received marrow from an identical twin, and 28 patients without a matched donor received autologous grafts purged with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide. Busulfan plus cyclophosphamide was the preparative regimen for the 25 patients who had received extensive prior irradiation, and the other 25 patients received cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation. The overall actuarial probability of event-free survival at 3 years was 30%, with a median follow-up of 26 months. The event-free survival following transplantation was influenced by the number of chemotherapy failures and the patient's response to conventional salvage therapy prior to transplant. The 16 patients who were transplanted at first relapse, while still responsive to standard therapy, had a 64% actuarial probability of event-free survival at 3 years. Age, presence of extranodal disease, preparative regimen, and type of graft (autologous v allogeneic) were not significant prognostic factors. The majority of transplant-related deaths were from interstitial pneumonitis; inadequate pulmonary function, multiple prior chemotherapy regimens, and prior chest irradiation all appeared to increase the transplant-related mortality. These results suggest a role for marrow transplantation in a subset of patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease who are unlikely to be otherwise cured but are still responsive to conventional-dose cytoreductive therapy.\r"

In an adequate and appropriate control historical group of 200 patients, no severe hemorrhages were recorded and the incidence of thrombotic events was 1.2% pt-yr. Thus, the analysis of risk factors was restricted to this latter group of events. Age, a previous thrombotic event, and long duration of thrombocytosis were identified as major risk factors for thrombosis, while smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension did not influence the rate of thrombotic episodes.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental studies in animals have suggested that coronary flow reserve may be limited in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Accordingly, to noninvasively determine the effect of LVH on myocardial perfusion reserve, 25 patients, 9 with LVH and 16 controls, underwent positron imaging with rubidium-82 (82Rb) (30-55 mCi) or nitrogen-13 (13N) ammonia (12-19 mCi) at rest and following intravenous dipyridamole and handgrip stress. LVH was documented by echocardiographic and/or electrocardiographic measurements. LVH patients had either no chest pain (n = 8) and/or a normal coronary angiogram (n = 6). Nine simultaneous transaxial images were acquired, and the mean ratio of stress to rest activity (S:R), based on all regions for each heart, was calculated as an estimate of myocardial perfusion reserve. There were no regional differences in activity (i.e., perfusion defects) in any of the studies. S:R averaged 1.41 +/- 0.10 (s.d.) for controls and 1.06 +/- 0.09 for patients with LVH (p less than 0.0001). These data provide support for an abnormality in perfusion reserve in patients with LVH.\r"

In animal studies, coronary collaterals are associated with coronary steal, defined as a regional fall in perfusion during coronary arteriolar vasodilation. To determine the effect of coronary arteriolar vasodilation on collateral bed perfusion in man, myocardial perfusion imaging was performed before and after pharmacologic coronary vasodilation in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Regional myocardial activity of 82Rb or 13N ammonia was measured by positron emission tomography (PET) at rest and with intravenous dipyridamole/handgrip stress in 28 patients with angiographic collaterals and in 25 control patients with similar CAD severity by quantitative arteriography. Regional myocardial activity decreased after dipyridamole, indicating coronary steal, in 25 of 28 patients with angiographic collaterals and in only 4 of 25 control patients without angiographic collaterals. These findings suggest that developed collaterals are associated with myocardial steal in patients with CAD, allowing potential use of PET for non-invasive identification of coronary collateralization.\r"

In an attempt to determine the scintigraphic natural history, 25 uncomplicated porous-coated hip arthroplasties in 21 patients were prospectively studied with serial TPBS and 111In-WBC at approximately 7 days, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo postoperatively. This report deals with findings related to the acetabulum. All 25 prostheses (144 of 144 scans) demonstrated increased uptake on the bone-phase images. Although this activity decreased with time, 76% had persistent uptake at 24 mo. Twenty-three of 25 prostheses (126 of 140 scans) showed increased uptake on 111In-WBC scintigraphy, invariably decreasing with time, but with 37% having significant uptake at 24 mo. Scintigraphic patterns in the uncomplicated porous-coated hip arthroplasty patient appear to differ from patterns described in cemented prostheses.\r"

We examined the kinetic behavior of 124IMT in brain and plasma in two patients with glioblastoma using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET). 124IMT accumulated in brain and tumor tissue, reaching a maximum after 15 min, with a washout of 20% to 35% at 60 min postinjection. Animal experiments confirmed the accumulation of the intact tracer in murine brain, but there was no incorporation into proteins. SPECT studies with 123IMT in patients with different types of brain tumors showed increased uptake in 26 of 32 tumors. Although nonspecific uptake in tumors must be considered, the accumulation of IMT in normal brain and in some tumors with intact BBB suggests a specific uptake of IMT. As transport is the main determinant of initial amino acid uptake, 123IMT appears to be a suitable SPECT tracer of amino acid uptake although it is not incorporated into protein.\r"

Several techniques to compensate for this variability have been proposed in adults, yet it has been suggested that depth correction is not necessary for quantitative renography in children. Skin-to-kidney center distances were measured from computed tomograms in 53 supine pediatric patients. Nearly 40% of the kidneys examined varied more than 1 cm from the average renal depth, and 8% deviated more than 2 cm. Right kidney depth differed from left kidney depth by more than 1 cm in less than 10% of the patients. Measurements were in agreement with regression equations based on lateral scintigraphy in children, but were consistently underestimated by nomograms developed for skin-to-kidney center distance in adults. Failure to recognize interindividual variability in skin-to-kidney center distance can introduce significant errors in quantitative pediatric renography.\r"

Renal amyloidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis when diffuse bilateral renal uptake of [67Ga]citrate is seen in the setting of nephrotic syndrome. Gallium uptake did not differentiate amyloid nephrotic syndrome from other causes of nephrotic syndrome.

However, 9 out of 15 patients with PE had recent surgery compared to none of the non-PE patients. SPD were seen in areas of ventilation and chest x-ray abnormalities in 12 of 15 PE and 11 of 19 non-PE cases. Size of the actual lesion was underestimated by scintigraphy in most cases. In 7 of 15 PE cases, the perfusion defect was larger than the corresponding ventilation abnormality. Most SPD were located at the bases. Twelve of 15 SPD in the PE group were at the posterior basilar segment. In the appropriate clinical setting, SPD carries at least a moderate probability for PE. When the clinical suspicion is high, a pulmonary angiography will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\r"

Both methods were studied with respect to their contribution to differential diagnosis in 23 patients with various brain tumors. The various neuroectodermal tumors differed with respect to their metabolic rate for glucose (MRGL). Benign and malignant tumors could be better differentiated by using tumor metabolism relative to contralateral brain and by evaluating heterogeneities in tumors. Low-grade gliomas usually showed normal 31P-MR spectra; high-grade gliomas were characterized by reduced and often split phosphodiester peaks and alkaline pH. Meningiomas, which had variable MRGL, typically showed extremely low phosphocreatine levels, reduced phosphodiesters, and alkaline pH. We concluded that FDG-PET and 31P-MRS examine different aspects of tumor metabolism. Therefore, both can contribute independently and complementarily to the differential diagnosis of brain tumors.\r"

All three diagnostic subgroups had evidence of decreased bone density, worst in the EDNOS subgroup and least in the BN subgroup. The most affected site was the femur, least the spine; the radius was intermediate. Age, body surface area, age of onset, and length of illness weakly correlated with the femur and spine density in the BN and EDNOS subgroups. Exercise was related to bone density in the AN subgroup in the femur, moderate exercise having a protective effect and strenuous exercise being detrimental. No significant correlation of bone density measurements with estradiol levels and/or history of amenorrhea was identified. Eating disorder patients are at risk for osteoporosis, which has multiple contributing factors including physical parameters and exercise. Estrogen deficiency by itself may not be a major causative factor.\r"

Tissue distribution studies with [125I]-rac-1-0-[12-(m-iodophenyl)dodecyl-2-0-methylglycero-3- phosphocholine in rats bearing the Walker 256 carcinosarcoma showed the tumor to contain the highest concentration of radioactivity at 24 hr (15% of the dose) and a tumor-to-blood ratio of 13. Scintigraphic images taken at 24 hr compared favorably with those obtained with (67Ga)-citrate. In contrast with the latter, however, the phospholipid ether showed little propensity to accumulate in an inflammatory lesion in the rat. Tumor visualization was also accomplished in a rabbit bearing the V x 2 adenocarcinoma. We conclude that phospholipid ethers may represent a new class of carrier molecules for the transport of radionuclides to tumors.\r"

In order to validate this potential, one needs to construct accurate biochemical models that reflect the metabolism of thymidine, including its uptake and degradation as well as its incorporation into DNA. Our studies employed thymidine labeled in the methyl position using 11C, 14C, and 3H. Studies with rapidly proliferating tissues of mice demonstrated that most of the activity, 60 min after injection of labeled thymidine, was present in DNA, with smaller amounts found in metabolites. Studies in dogs, however, reveal that more activity was present in metabolites, rather than in the DNA of tumors and spleen tissue. HPLC analysis of canine blood after the injection of thymidine revealed rapid conversion of thymidine to thymine and other metabolites. We have found significant differences in the metabolism of [3H]thymidine versus thymidine labeled with radioactive carbon. These differences, which were not found when comparing 14C and 11C, indicate that [3H]thymidine is not an appropriate standard for comparison with PET studies employing [11C] thymidine. To accurately interpret images of [11C]thymidine as representations of DNA synthesis we are developing kinetic models that take into account the metabolism of thymidine and the contribution of degradation products to the 11C images.\r"

Indium-111-(111In) labeled LDL was prepared and its purity demonstrated by agarose electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. In vitro studies with cultured human fibroblasts demonstrated significant inhibition of iodine-125-(125I) LDL binding to LDL receptors by 111In-LDL, although this was less than the inhibition produced by unlabeled LDL. Adrenal gland uptake of 111In-LDL by hypercholesterolemic rabbits was reduced by 86% compared to the level of uptake observed in normal rabbits. These results were compatible with downregulation of adrenal LDL receptors in the hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Uptake of 111In-LDL in the atherosclerotic proximal aorta of hypercholesterolemic rabbits was 2.5 times higher than in normal rabbits. These results suggest that 111In-LDL has the potential to be a useful agent for external imaging of atherosclerotic lesions and lipoprotein biodistribution.\r"

To evaluate the potential of Cu-PTSM for CBF PET studies, baboon single-pass cerebral extraction measurements and PET imaging were carried out with the use of 67Cu (t1/2 = 2.6 days) and 64Cu (t1/2 = 12.7 hr), respectively. All three chelates were extracted into the brain with high efficiency. There was some clearance of all chelates in the 10-50-sec time frame and Cu-PTSM2 continued to clear. Cu-PTSM and Cu-ETSM have high residual brain activity. PET imaging of baboon brain was carried out with the use of [64Cu]-Cu-PTSM. For comparison with the 64Cu brain image, a CBF (15O-labeled water) image (40 sec) was first obtained. Qualitatively, the H2(15)O and [64Cu]-Cu-PTSM images were very similar; for example, a comparison of gray to white matter uptake resulted in ratios of 2.42 for H2(15)O and 2.67 for Cu-PTSM. No redistribution of 64Cu was observed in 2 hr of imaging, as was predicted from the single-pass study results. Quantitative determination of blood flow using Cu-PTSM showed good agreement with blood flow determined with H2(15)O. This data suggests that [62Cu]-Cu-PTSM may be a useful generator-produced radiopharmaceutical for blood flow studies with PET.\r"

  ".U": "90172084\r", 
  ".W": "The 1980 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Febrile Seizures identified five circumstances in which it might be appropriate to consider anticonvulsant prophylaxis after a first febrile seizure: (1) a focal or prolonged seizure, (2) neurologic abnormalities, (3) afebrile seizures in a first-degree relative, (4) age less than 1 year, and (5) multiple seizures occurring within 24 hours. We performed a metaanalysis of 14 published reports to evaluate the strength of association between each of these indications and recurrent febrile seizures. Young age at onset (less than or equal to 1 year) and a family history of febrile seizures (not listed in the recommendations) each distinguished between groups with approximately a 30% versus a 50% risk of recurrence. Family history of afebrile seizures was not consistently associated with an increased risk. Focal, prolonged, and multiple seizures were associated with only a small increment in risk of recurrence. The data were not adequate to assess the risk associated with neurologic abnormalities. By considering children with combinations of risk factors, some studies were able to distinguish between groups with very low and very high recurrence risks. Only age at onset was consistently predictive of having more than one recurrence. These results suggest that the great majority of children who have a febrile seizure do not need anticonvulsant treatment even if one of the factors listed in the Consensus Statement is present, and that the rationale and indications for treating febrile seizures need to be reconsidered.\r"

  ".U": "90172085\r", 
  ".W": "In an effort to obtain data to provide the basis for the design of controlled clinical trials, we contacted all U.S. participants in the National ECMO Registry to assemble the national experience on the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis during the past 5 years. Twelve infants were treated at nine centers between 1983 and 1988. Eight had been born prematurely, and five had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The mean age at onset of infection with respiratory syncytial virus was 108 +/- 102 days. The mean length of ventilator management before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was 7.8 +/- 7.1 days. All infants had persistent hypoxemia with a mean arterial oxygen pressure of 39.2 +/- 11.7 torr (5.3 +/- 1.6 kPa) despite high ventilator pressures (mean airway pressure 19.7 +/- 6.4 cm H2O) and 100% inspired oxygen; six had air leak syndrome. Seven infants survived (58%). The mean duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for survivors was 233 +/- 139 hours. Preexisting chronic lung disease did not predict a poor outcome: four of the five infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia survived. Six of the survivors have subsequently achieved expected developmental milestones and one has slight motor delay. We conclude that, for infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis whose condition deteriorates despite maximal ventilator management, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may provide lifesaving support. The duration of successful treatment with this therapy may be longer than that for conventional neonatal indications, but excellent neurologic outcome may be expected in survivors.\r"

  ".U": "90172087\r", 
  ".W": "Because of concerns about the declining autopsy rate, an attempt was made to evaluate the contributions from the postmortem examination in a pediatric population with leukemia. Accordingly, 161 autopsies performed between 1970 and 1985 were reviewed and the diagnoses compared with those listed in the clinical records of the same patients. New diagnoses were grouped into diagnoses of diseases thought to have contributed to the death of the patient, those of diseases thought to have contributed to the morbidity of the patient, those of presumed toxic reactions to drug therapy, and diagnoses of academic interest. The newly diagnosed diseases thought to have contributed to the patient's death either had been totally unsuspected by the clinician or had been suspected but incorrectly diagnosed. The most common revelation was the identification of mycotic infections that were thought by the clinician to have been bacterial in origin. The clinical diagnosis of these kinds of infections progressively improved during the study period. Because the changes in diagnoses and therapy, particularly the increasing use of antimycotic therapy, could be directly attributed to autopsy findings and, more recently, because of the expanding use of more toxic multiagent chemotherapy, we believe that the postmortem examination remains an important procedure, even in clinical situations where much is known about the patient.\r"

Forty-five children born of mothers with antibodies to HIV type 1 were studied; P24 antigen was measured in plasma, and HIV-1 proviral DNA was sought in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after amplification by PCR. In 26 cases, blood specimens were cultured for HIV; in all but two instances cultures were established at the same time that the PCR test was performed. Primer pairs in three regions of the proviral genome were used for the PCR test. There was good agreement between the results obtained from PCR tests and from cultures; of 24 children in whom both tests were done at the same time, 10 had positive results on both the culture and the PCR test, 1 had positive results on the PCR test but negative culture results, and 13 had negative results on both tests (concordance 96%). Measurement of p24 antigen in plasma was, in contrast, an insensitive marker of infection: 6 of 12 infants with positive cultures had positive p24 test results, and 8 of 18 infants had positive PCR test results. Sixteen children with subsequent seronegativity for HIV-1 had negative PCR results. This study provides further evidence that the PCR test is a valid alternative to viral culture for the diagnosis of pediatric HIV infection.\r"

Recurrent or severe infections with organisms other than Candida were seen in 80% of the patients. There were nine cases of septicemia. Seven patients have died; six of these deaths were directly related to non-Candida infectious complications. Endocrine dysfunction, including Addison disease (11 patients) and hypothyroidism (9 patients), was seen in 19 of 43 patients. Immunologic studies failed to reveal a consistent abnormality, although two of five patients with reversed T4/T8 ratios are among those who have died. Ketoconazole was effective in controlling symptoms of candidiasis in most patients. The findings from this study indicate that non-Candida infections cause serious morbidity and may result in death in patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.\r"

Proposed causes include prenatal viral or parasitic infections and vascular disruptions. We report seven infants with the fetal brain disruption sequence. Two of these patients died. A changing phenotype with time was seen in three. Recognition of this phenotype is critical because the condition has a uniformly poor prognosis for infants but the recurrence risk in future pregnancies is low.\r"
