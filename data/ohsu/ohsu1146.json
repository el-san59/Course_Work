  ".W": "The thromboxane A2-receptor antagonistic properties of Bay U 3405 [(3R)-3-(4-fluorophenylsulfonamido)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-carbaz o-lepropanoic acid] have been evaluated in various pharmacologic models. Bay U 3405 specifically inhibits platelet aggregation induced by U 46619, collagen, platelet-activating factor, and the second wave of ADP (IC50 0.5, 0.07, 0.3, 0.19 microM) in human plasma. The plasma phase of ADP-induced aggregation is not affected. U 46619-induced platelet aggregation is competitively antagonized (pA2 = 6.3). In humans, ex vivo platelet aggregation is inhibited after oral application of 2 or 50 mg Bay U 3405. Bay U 3405 also specifically and competitively antagonizes U 46619-induced contractions of rabbit aortic rings (pA2 = 7.4). In vivo, Bay U 3405 protects rabbits dose dependently from arachidonic acid or collagen-induced thromboembolism (ED50 1-3 mg/kg p.o). Chronic administration of Bay U 3405 to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats reduces stroke-related mortality and diminishes the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhages. From these results, we conclude that Bay U 3405 is an orally active, selective, and competitive thromboxane A2-receptor antagonist that may be beneficial in the treatment of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases.\r"

  ".U": "91082117\r", 
  ".W": "Many nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exert their effects by inhibiting the synthesis of prostanoids. More specifically, these agents block the synthesis of prostaglandin endoperoxide G2 from arachidonic acid by competing with arachidonate for binding to the cyclooxygenase active site of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase. Studies of the molecular biology of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase indicate that there is a single gene for the enzyme. Thus, tissue-specific effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs probably result from differences in drug distribution and/or metabolism and not from the existence of tissue-specific prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase isozymes. Aspirin causes inactivation of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase by first binding to the cyclooxygenase active site and then acetylating the protein at Ser530. Although the cyclooxygenase activity is inactivated, the hydroperoxidase activity of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase is unaltered by Aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Replacement of Ser530 of the native enzyme with an alanine residue by site-directed mutagenesis yields a prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase with unaltered catalytic and substrate binding activities. Thus, the hydroxyl group of Ser530 is not essential for enzyme activity. Instead, it appears likely that acetylation of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase by Aspirin simply places a bulky acetyl group at or near the cyclooxygenase active site, thereby interfering with arachidonic acid binding.\r"

  ".W": "Human platelets release two major classes of vasoactive mediators during the secretion reaction: arachidonic acid metabolites and biogenic amines. All of these compounds, in particular thromboxane A2, PGF2 alpha, and serotonin (5-HT), are potent constrictors of human cerebral arteries in vitro. This contractile action of platelet-derived vasoconstrictors, as well as their prothrombotic activity, is antagonized by the vascular endothelium. Atherosclerotic alterations of the vessel wall endothelium, typical for cerebral ischemia and stroke, are associated with platelet hyperreactivity and enhanced mediator release during stimulation. Inhibition of platelet (hyper)function by acetylsalicylic acid or ticlopidine has clear protective effects in high-risk patients, underlining the significance of these platelet-derived products for cerebral thromboembolism and vasoconstriction. Whether more selective inhibitors of thromboxane generations or action are equally effective remains to be determined.\r"

Pial artery segments (0.6-1 mm o.d.) were incubated in oxygenated (20%) Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing indomethacin. Addition of acetylcholine (0.1 microM) to rings precontracted by serotonin (0.1 microM) resulted in a significant (p less than 0.05) relaxation. This response disappeared after removal of the endothelium and addition of hemoglobin, a nitric oxide scavenger, and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of L-arginine-derived nitric oxide biosynthesis. L-Arginine (10 microM) considerably attenuated the inhibitory action of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Relaxations induced by 3-morpholinosydnonimine and nitroglycerin (0.1 microM), two exogenous sources of nitric oxide, were unaffected by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (10 microM) but abolished by hemoglobin. These data strongly suggest nitric oxide as the mediator of endothelium-derived relaxation in pial arteries of the cattle.\r"

Synapse loss was accentuated, however, within immature and mature plaques. These findings suggest that the pathogenetic process in AD might commence with synapse loss and neurodegeneration rather than with deposition of amyloid beta protein.\r"

Therefore in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the cellular sources of TGF-alpha production in this model system. Surprisingly one cell type in the inflammatory infiltrate present in the connective tissue adjacent to the transformed epithelium represented a major source of TGF-alpha mRNA. Detailed analysis of these cells revealed that they were eosinophils. In addition to TGF-alpha mRNA, about 40% of the eosinophils associated with the oral tumors exhibited TGF-alpha product reactive with a monoclonal antibody against the C terminus of the mature TGF-alpha peptide. Normal hamster bone marrow eosinophils also exhibited TGF-alpha mRNA and product by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that the eosinophil represents a biologically significant source of TGF-alpha.\r"

  ".W": "A new transplantable rat pituitary tumor was induced in F344 female rats with dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and estrogen (MtT/F-DMBA) and studied for 20 serial transplant generations. The tumor grew without estrogen supplements in female rats by the second transplant generation. Sensitivity to estrogens, as indicated by a prolonged latency period for tumor development, was seen at the 20th, but not the 5th transplant generation. MtT/F-DMBA tumors expressed prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) mRNAs. A decrease in the percentage of cells expressing PRL mRNA, PRL protein, and in the number of secretory granules per cell occurred with serial transplantation. S-100 protein-positive folliculostellate cells were present in the hyperplastic pituitary but not in the transplantable tumors. Estrogen treatment at the 20th transplant generation prolonged the tumor latency period, increased the number of cells expressing PRL mRNA greater than 5-fold by in situ hybridization analysis (14 +/- 2% versus 77 +/- 5%), increased PRL secretion (132 +/- 40 ng/ml versus 3762 +/- 890 ng/ml), and increased the number of cytoplasmic secretory granules per cell. These results indicate that hyperplastic pituitary and true pituitary neoplasms differ in their ability to grow readily after transplantation. The presence of S-100 protein-positive folliculostellate cells, which are present in hyperplastic but not in neoplastic pituitary tissues, may serve as a morphologic marker to separate hyperplastic and neoplastic rat pituitary tissues. Transplantable tumors remained responsive to estrogen with expression of a more differentiated phenotype, including an increased number of cells expressing PRL mRNA and increased numbers of PRL secretory granules.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To develop a diagnosis-based case mix classification system for emergency department patient visits based on direct costs of care designed for an outpatient setting. DESIGN: Prospective provider time study with collection of financial data from each hospital's accounts receivable system and medical information, including discharge diagnosis, from hospital medical records. SETTING: Three community hospital EDs in Los Angeles County during selected times in 1984. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Only direct costs of care were included: health care provider time, ED management and clerical personnel excluding registration, nonlabor ED expense including supplies, and ancillary hospital services. Indirect costs for hospitals and physicians, including depreciation and amortization, debt service, utilities, malpractice insurance, administration, billing, registration, and medical records were not included. Costs were derived by valuing provider time based on a formula using annual income or salary and fringe benefits, productivity and direct care factors, and using hospital direct cost to charge ratios. Physician costs were based on a national study of emergency physician income and excluded practice costs. Patients were classified into one of 216 emergency department groups (EDGs) on the basis of the discharge diagnosis, patient disposition, age, and the presence of a limited number of physician procedures. Total mean direct costs ranged from $23 for follow-up visit to $936 for trauma, admitted, with critical care procedure. The mean total direct costs for the 16,771 nonadmitted patients was $69. Of this, 34% was for ED costs, 45% was for ancillary service costs, and 21% was for physician costs. The mean total direct costs for the 1,955 admitted patients was $259. Of this, 23% was for ED costs, 63% was for ancillary service costs, and 14% was for physician costs. Laboratory and radiographic services accounted for approximately 85% of all ancillary service costs and 38% of total direct costs for nonadmitted patients versus 80% of ancillary service costs and 51% of total direct costs for admitted patients. CONCLUSION: We have developed a diagnosis-based case mix classification system for ED patient visits based on direct costs of care designed for an outpatient setting which, unlike diagnosis-related groups, includes the measurement of time-based cost for physician and nonphysician services. This classification system helps to define direct costs of hospital and physician emergency services by type of patient.\r"

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using data from the medical literature in a simulation model to estimate the costs of and the risk for perforation associated with periodic colonoscopic surveillance for a 50-year-old man followed for 30 years. MAIN RESULTS: A program of colonoscopy every 3 years would incur cumulatively a 1.4% risk for colon perforation, a 0.11% risk for perforation-related death, and direct physician costs of $2071 for colonoscopy (discounted at 5%). If a 50-year-old man's cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer is 2.5% after the removal of a single small adenoma and if effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance every 3 years is 100%, then one death from cancer could be prevented by doing 283 colonoscopies, incurring 0.6 perforations, 0.04 perforation-related deaths, and direct physician costs of $82,000. If surveillance were 50% effective and the cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer were 1.25%--a plausible scenario--1131 colonoscopies would be required to prevent one death from cancer, incurring 2.3 perforations, 0.17 perforation-related deaths, and physician costs of $331,000. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance is very sensitive to estimates of the cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer after polypectomy as well as to surveillance efficacy. For persons whose remaining risk for death from cancer may be low, such as persons with a single small adenoma, recommendations for colonoscopic surveillance at fixed and regular intervals may be excessively costly.\r"

DESIGN: Open-label, uncontrolled trial with a mean follow-up of 24 months. SETTING: Referral-based, teaching medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty-three patients with symptomatic tachycardia and an extranodal accessory pathway. INTERVENTIONS: Patients had electrophysiologic testing before and after the initiation of oral flecainide therapy and were followed long-term for the presence of symptoms, new physical limitations, and adverse effects of therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Flecainide therapy prevented or slowed (324 +/- 59 ms to 398 +/- 55 ms; P less than 0.001) inducible sustained atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia in 44 of 63 patients (70%). Of the 44 patients discharged from the hospital, 33 (75%) have continued to receive flecainide therapy and have shown no adverse effects (mean follow-up, 24 +/- 10 months). Adverse cardiac reactions (proarrhythmia or sinus node suppression) attributable to flecainide occurred in 11 of 63 patients (17%); in 9 (82%) of these 11 patients, events were detected during either in-hospital monitoring or the electrophysiologic study done before discharge. Structural heart disease was detected by two-dimensional echocardiography in 8 of 11 patients who had adverse cardiac events and in 6 of 52 patients who did not have such events (P less than 0.001). Isoproterenol reversed the effects of flecainide therapy in 11 of 21 patients; 7 of the 11 patients had spontaneous clinical recurrences of tachycardia or palpitations during the follow-up period, but these symptoms occurred in only 1 of 10 patients who did not show isoproterenol-induced reversal (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Oral flecainide therapy was effective in 33 of 63 patients who had tachycardia and an extranodal accessory connection. Hospital monitoring during initial therapy is recommended, and flecainide should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with structural heart disease. An isoproterenol challenge appears to be helpful in predicting late recurrence of tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of ciprofloxacin therapy in eradicating convalescent fecal excretion of salmonellae after acute salmonellosis. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of ciprofloxacin, with prospective follow-up of nonparticipants. SETTING: An acute care community hospital experiencing an outbreak of salmonellosis. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight health care workers developed acute infection with Salmonella java; 15 participated in a placebo-controlled trial of ciprofloxacin, beginning on day 9 after infection. INTERVENTIONS: Eight patients were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, and 7 patients to receive placebo; both were administered orally twice daily for 14 days. Nonparticipants who received therapy were placed on the same ciprofloxacin regimen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Study participants had follow-up stool cultures every 3 days initially and then weekly for 3 weeks; nonparticipants were followed until three consecutive cultures were negative. All eight ciprofloxacin recipients showed eradication of S. java from stool cultures within 7 days of beginning therapy (compared with 1 of 7 placebo recipients), and their stool cultures remained negative up to 14 days after discontinuing therapy (P less than 0.01). However, 4 of 8 relapsed; their stool cultures became positive between 14 and 21 days after therapy. In addition, 3 of 3 hospitalized patients treated with ciprofloxacin who did not participate in the controlled trial also relapsed. Thus, the total relapse rate was 7 of 11 (64%; 95% CI, 31% to 89%). In 4 of these 7 patients, relapse was associated with a longer duration of fecal excretion of salmonellae than that of the placebo group. Relapse could not be explained on the basis of noncompliance, development of resistance, or presence of biliary disease. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its excellent antimicrobial activity against salmonellae and its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, ciprofloxacin at a dosage of 750 mg orally twice daily had an unacceptably high failure rate in patients with acute salmonellosis and may have prolonged fecal excretion of salmonellae. The late occurrence of relapses indicates the need to obtain stool cultures up to 21 days after therapy to document fecal eradication in acute salmonellosis.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken in an effort to understand the role of cytokines in T lymphocyte trafficking into inflamed synovium and in the potential enhancement of antigen presentation by human synovial fibroblasts. We found that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) each increased the cell surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on human synovial fibroblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Maximal ICAM-1 expression occurred within 8 hours of induction, with the following order of efficacy: IFN gamma greater than TNF alpha greater than IL-1 beta. The number of cells bearing the ICAM-1 antigen also increased, from a basal level of approximately 30% to more than 83% after cytokine induction (for all 3 cytokines). ICAM-1 expression rapidly decreased following cytokine removal. The expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 was also examined, but it was not changed by any of the 3 cytokines. Class I major histocompatibility complex antigen expression was increased modestly by all 3 cytokines, and expression was maximal by 24 hours after treatment. Only IFN gamma induced HLA class II antigen expression, and this expression persisted for up to 6 days following removal of the lymphokine. IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor had no effect on any of the parameters examined. Our data support an interactive role for inflammatory cytokines and the expression of adhesion ligands and HLA antigens by human synovial fibroblasts in the pathogenesis of synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

At the end of the 6 months, there was a significant increase in serum testosterone levels (P less than 0.05), an increase in the number of CD8+ T cells, and a decrease in the CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratio. The IgM rheumatoid factor concentration decreased significantly (P less than 0.05). There was a concurrent significant reduction in the number of affected joints (P less than 0.05) and in the daily intake of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (P less than 0.01). The well-known immunosuppressive action of androgens probably contributed to our findings in these RA patients.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-seven patients with Raynaud's disease were studied for a mean of 4 years (range 1-11 years) to determine the relationship between autoantibodies and long-term clinical outcome. Anticentromere antibodies (ACA) were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence and by immunoblotting of HeLa cell chromosome extracts. Antibodies to topoisomerase I (anti-topo I) were assayed by immunodiffusion and immunoblotting. Antibodies to the major centromeric protein, CENP-B, and anti-topo I were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Eight patients developed telangiectasias, 4 developed skin tightening, and 4 developed a connective tissue disease other than scleroderma. The presence of ACA at the start of the study was associated with the development of telangiectasias (P less than 0.003). An initial 100-kd band on immunoblot in conjunction with a positive anti-topo I ELISA result was associated with the development of tight skin (P less than 0.0025), while a 100-kd band with a negative anti-topo I ELISA result was associated with the subsequent development of a connective tissue disease other than scleroderma (P less than 0.0073). Patients who were initially ACA positive, had the 100-kd band on immunoblot, or had positive ELISA results for anti-topo I or for anti-CENP-B were 63-fold more likely to develop signs of connective tissue disease by the end of the study (P less than 0.000009). The presence of any of these autoantibodies was more sensitive (100%), although less specific (75%), than were findings from nailfold capillaroscopy (sensitivity 67% and specificity 95%) in predicting subsequent clinical progression. We conclude that findings of assays for anti-topo I and ACA complement the findings from nailfold capillaroscopy in providing useful prognostic information in Raynaud's disease.\r"

The antigens were produced as particulate fusion proteins by exploiting the ability of a protein encoded by the yeast retrotransposon Ty to assemble into virus-like particles (Ty-VLPs). Hybrid HIV: Ty-VLPs carrying each of the antigens were applied to nitrocellulose strips at specified locations in a slot-blot format and then used to detect antibodies present in human serum and plasma samples of diverse geographical origin. Previously confirmed HIV-1- and HIV-2-positive samples were readily and reliably identified. The assay was used to identify a case of HIV-2 infection in an African woman who had been resident in the Oxford region for the last 3 years and to analyse the prevalence of anti-HIV antibodies in a longitudinal study of seroconverting patients. We also demonstrate that the assay works efficiently with whole blood.\r"

There were no false-negative or false-positive pools, resulting in a calculated seroprevalence estimate of 2.42%. Further testing of all sera in positive pools can identify HIV-positive individuals. These applications were modeled to compare the cost-efficiency of pooling with individual testing under different conditions. The results suggest that pooling provides an alternative test format for use in both developing and industrialized countries when the seroprevalence and/or the marginal cost of obtaining a sample are sufficiently low. For our cohort, testing only the pools for seroprevalence estimation resulted in a 78% cost saving compared with individual testing; pooling with subsequent identification of individual seropositives represented a 56% cost reduction.\r"

  ".W": "We used a quantitative bioassay (the beta-gal assay) to visualize and quantify syncytium induction by fresh HIV isolates. This bioassay is based on the transactivation by tat of a chimeric gene comprising an HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) fused to a modified lacZ gene of Escherichia coli. The chimeric gene encodes a beta-galactosidase which is translocated to the nucleus. It allows the enzymatic staining of all nuclei from HIV-induced syncytia. Using this unequivocal assay (the beta-gal assay), we could assess the syncytium-inducing properties of fresh HIV isolates after only 4 days of coculture of patient lymphocytes with activated normal lymphocytes. Syncytium-inducing HIV isolates were detected in 11 out of 40 seropositive patients studied. They were isolated mainly from AIDS patients: eight out of 17 grade IV (according to Centers for Disease Control criteria) patients were infected with syncytium-inducing strains. However, of 23 grade II and III patients tested, syncytium-inducing HIV strains were isolated from three cases. These three patients displayed no detectable p24 antigenaemia and had a CD4+ cell count of greater than 300 cells/microliter. The in vitro replication rate of HIV grown from 36 patient blood samples was then examined by sequential p24 antigen measurements in coculture supernatants. The 10 samples leading to syncytium formation also exhibited the highest replication rate. The possibility of unequivocally detecting syncytium-inducing strains after only a few days of coculture will make this detection routine and rapid. In addition, the limited period of amplification required is a significant advantage as it minimizes the emergence of HIV variants selected during long-term in vitro cultures.\r"

The effect of this peptide on the duration and potency of the hypotensive action of ANF (99-126) was also studied. C-ANF (4-23), infused at 400 micrograms/h for 2 h, reduced blood pressure, cardiac output and stroke volume, and increased total peripheral resistance slightly. These changes were similar to those previously observed with infusion of 20 micrograms/h ANF (99-126) in sheep. Endogenous ANF concentration increased from 28 +/- 13 to 85 +/- 18 pg/mL after 80 min infusion of C-ANF (4-23). The duration of hypotensive action from injection of ANF (99-126) was increased almost two-fold during infusion of C-ANF (4-23), however the hypotensive potency of ANF (99-126) was similar both prior to and during infusion of C-ANF (4-23). These studies support the concept of the metabolism of ANF via clearance receptors, suggesting that long-term hemodynamic actions of endogenous ANF may be achieved via prolonged blockade of these clearance receptors.\r"

Prior administration of a long-acting propranolol, 160 mg daily for 3 consecutive days, markedly elevated plasma ANP levels before, during and after exercise. In addition, the mean basal Hct increased significantly and further rose during exercise after propranolol administration. When increments in plasma ANP concentrations during exercise in individual subjects were compared with those in Hct, there was a significant positive correlation between the two variables before and after propranolol administration. The results indicate a close relationship between the changes in plasma ANP and those in Hct during exercise at different ANP levels, and suggest that ANP may be at least one of the factors involved in the hemoconcentration associated with exercise.\r"

Dietary sodium intake was then increased gradually by 50 mmol/day to a maximum of 350 mmol/day over a 7 day period. With the gradual increase in sodium intake there were progressive increases in urinary sodium and cumulative sodium balance. These were associated with gradual increases in plasma ANP and reductions in both plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity. During the study there were no significant changes in blood pressure, urinary potassium and creatinine clearance. This study demonstrates a marked sensitivity of the responses of both the ANP and the renin-aldosterone system to small changes in sodium intake and points to their importance in the renal adaptations to small alterations in dietary sodium intake.\r"

Dopamine was infused at 1 microgram/kg/min for 120 min into 7 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and 5 normotensive subjects (NT). After 40 min of dopamine infusion, ANP infusion at 25 ng/kg/min was added to dopamine for 40 min. Before, during and after the infusion, renal function and nephrogenous cGMP were determined. Dopamine did not influence blood pressure, but increased urinary Na excretion (UNaV) by 100% in EH and NT. Addition of ANP further increased UNaV by 90%, but increases in UNaV were greater in EH than in NT. Renal blood flow was increased only by dopamine, while glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was increased by both dopamine (+8%) and dopamine plus ANP (+7%) as a whole, resulting in a significant increase in filtration fraction by the addition of ANP. Plasma and urinary cGMP and nephrogenous cGMP were elevated only during ANP infusion. These results suggest that the effects of ANP and dopamine on both GFR and UNaV were additive. However, in contrast with dopamine, ANP increased efferent resistance and nephrogenous cGMP, suggesting that the renal effects of ANP are different from those of dopamine.\r"

Intrarenal ANP did not cause changes in arterial pressure and hematocrit, nor in contralateral kidney handling of sodium. Its natriuretic effect on the right kidney resulted from an increase in the filtered load of sodium and from a decrease in reabsorption in the distal segments of the nephron.

Twenty patients were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative, 26 HIV-positive stage CDC II or III, and 15 were HIV-positive stage CDC IV. T lymphocytes, CD4-positive, or CD8-positive T subsets were cocultured with B lymphocytes and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) for 6 days and Ig-secreting cells were assessed in a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. The presence of IgM, IgG, C3d, or gp120 on the surface of T cells or T subsets was analyzed by flow cytometry. Autoantibodies against CD4-positive T cells were not detected in controls or HIV-negative patients, but were common in HIV-positive patients (20 of 41 patients). In patients with autoantibodies we found an increased incidence of CD4 helper defects (P less than .0001 in CDC II or III patients; P less than .02 in CDC IV patients). 12 of 13 patients with IgM autoantibodies and 4 of 4 with IgG autoantibodies showed CD4 helper defects. Complement fixation had no relevance. Autoantibody formation against CD4 cells was not due to increased in vivo B-cell stimulation (spontaneous plaque formation: 611 +/- 204 PFC/10(6) B cells in autoantibody-negative patients v 650 +/- 202 PFC/10(6) B cells in autoantibody-positive patients; not significant). Thus, our results suggest that autoantibody formation is not caused by a general state of in vivo B-cell activation. Rather, the production of autoantibodies appears to coincide with defects in B-cell proliferation or differentiation, as shown by reduced mitogen-stimulated B-cell responses in CDC II and III patients (P less than .05). Autoantibodies against CD4 cells appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of CD4 helper defects of HIV-infected patients.\r"

  ".W": "A high frequency (greater than 80%) of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) exhibit a recombination of the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta chain locus. Interestingly, distinct TCR delta elements are preferentially used in immunologic subtypes. In a recent series of 201 children with common ALL (cALL) we observed a TCR delta rearrangement in 162 patients, 57% of the latter showing a hybridization pattern in Southern blots suggestive of a V delta 2 to D delta 3 recombination. To verify this interpretation and to elucidate in more detail the diversity of this common type of TCR delta recombination we amplified and sequenced the junctional region of nine cALL patients and cell line REH-6 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A V delta 2 D delta 3 recombination was confirmed in all cases; convincing evidence for the participation of D delta 1 or D delta 2 elements was not obtained. Eight of nine patients and REH-6 showed complete 5' D delta 3 boundaries within V delta 2 D delta 3 segments, a limitation of junctional diversity also detected in 50% of peripheral blood cell clones derived from two healthy probands. Notably, sequence identity at the V delta 2 D delta 3 junction was demonstrated for a cALL and one of the control clones. Another group of 35 of 162 cALL patients was characterized by V delta 2 rearrangements and biallelic deletion of J delta and C delta sequences. Using a J alpha consensus primer, PCR-directed sequence analysis demonstrated V delta 2 D delta 3 J alpha recombinations in all four cases analyzed by this approach. The J alpha segments of these patients differed, but were identical or homologous to published J alpha elements. Our data suggest a recombination pathway of the TCR delta/alpha locus leading to chimeric TCR alpha molecules, containing V delta and, remarkably, also D delta sequences.\r"

  ".W": "Some mouse myeloid leukemias induced by X-irradiation and serially transplanted into syngenic mice do not proliferate in vitro even in the presence of hematopoietic factors. To examine whether such leukemic cells can proliferate in response to stromal cells, we cocultured them with MC3T3-G2/PA6 (PA6) preadipocytes, cells that can support the growth of hematopoietic stem cells. All leukemias developed into in vitro cell lines, showing a dependence on contact with the PA6 cells. Two cell lines responded to none of the known hematopoietic factors including interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, and Epo. These results demonstrate that the mechanism of the action of PA6 cells is different from that of any of the known hematopoietic factors, and that, because these two leukemic cell lines retained the ability to grow in vivo, responsiveness to the known hematopoietic factors is not essential for the leukemic cell growth in vivo. Furthermore, all leukemic cell lines could respond also to the preadipocytes fixed with formalin, paraformaldehyde, or glutaraldehyde, suggesting that some molecule(s) associated with the surface of PA6 cells or with extracellular matrix secreted by the preadipocytes is responsible for the leukemic cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "The c-fos proto-oncogene seems to play an important role during differentiation and activation of cells from the hematopoietic lineage. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the mechanism underlying its transcriptional activation in these cells. To delineate the sequences and factors involved in c-fos transcriptional activation during the course of myeloid cell differentiation, we have used the K 562 chronic leukemic cell line as a model. K 562 cells were transfected with chloramphenicol transacetylase (CAT) reporter constructs, including various regions of the human c-fos promoter, and induced to differentiate by two distinct agents: 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which activates a differentiation program along the megakaryoblastic pathway; and hemin, which induces erythroid differentiation. We show here that TPA treatment of K 562 cells induces fos CAT reporter constructs activation, whereas treatment with hemin does not. Furthermore, predifferentiation of the cells with hemin blocks a subsequent induction by TPA, in correlation with the inhibition by hemin of megakaryoblastic differentiation markers appearance. Both the induction by TPA and the inhibition by hemin are mediated by a dyad symmetry element (DSE) located in the upstream regulatory region, between -318 and -296. These results suggest that the protein complex binding to the DSE regulatory element is the target for c-fos activation by TPA and inhibition by hemin in K 562 cells. However, no modulation of protein affinity for the DSE sequence was detected by gel shift assay during the course of induction or inhibition, suggesting that the structural change responsible for the transcriptional modulation is too unstable or too subtle to be detected by this method.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of fibrinogen degradation products D, E, and D-dimer on a human promonocytic leukemia cell line, NOMO-1. After exposure to a 10(-5)-mol/L fragment D or D-dimer, the cells displayed macrophage-like characteristics, such as adherence to plastic surfaces, and showed approximately a twofold increase in response to the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test. The secretion of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) into the medium was markedly stimulated by a 10(-5)-mol/L fragment D, E, and D-dimer, whereas a significant increase in IL-1 beta secretion was observed only in D-dimer-stimulated cells. In addition, D-dimer induced a rapid increase in urokinase-type plasminogen activator on day 1 (0.52 +/- 0.02 ng/mL v 0.07 +/- 0.01 ng/mL in the control culture) and a slow increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 on day 5 (3.9 +/- 1.6 ng/mL v 1.2 +/- 0.2 ng/mL in the control culture). An increase in tissue factor (TF) was also demonstrated on the cell surface of NOMO-1 cells exposed to fragment D or D-dimer by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-TF monoclonal antibody. Scatchard plot analysis showed that fragment D and D-dimer bound to the NOMO-1 cells with a kd of 3.3 nmol/L and 2.7 nmol/L, respectively. These results suggest that fragment D-dimer specifically stimulates cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage to secrete key substances that regulate blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation.\r"

We investigated mediators of endothelium-dependent responses in human internal mammary arteries and saphenous veins. The inhibitor of nitric oxide formation, NG-monomethyl L-arginine, enhanced the sensitivity to norepinephrine (fivefold) and evoked more pronounced endothelium-dependent contractions in internal mammary arteries (19 +/- 6% of 100 mM KCl) than in saphenous veins (2 +/- 1%; p less than 0.005). In internal mammary arteries, NG-monomethyl L-arginine, but not indomethacin, markedly reduced endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine (from 95 +/- 2% to 39 +/- 7%; p less than 0.005) and prevented those to histamine (78 +/- 6% to 4 +/- 3%; p less than 0.005). In saphenous veins, endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were weak (24 +/- 11%), while nitric oxide caused comparable relaxations (85 +/- 3%) as in internal mammary arteries (80 +/- 5%; NS). NG-Monomethyl L-arginine prevented the relaxations to acetylcholine and unmasked endothelium-dependent contractions (30 +/- 10%). Indomethacin and the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor CGS-13080 augmented relaxations of saphenous veins to acetylcholine from 24 +/- 11% to 46 +/- 9% (p less than 0.05). Histamine-evoked contractions were converted to endothelium-dependent relaxations by indomethacin and the thromboxane A2/endoperoxide receptor antagonist SQ-30741 (38 +/- 3% and 40 +/- 6%; p less than 0.05) but not CGS-13080. Thus, 1) nitric oxide mediates endothelium-dependent relaxations in human arteries and veins; 2) internal mammary arteries release more nitric oxide than do saphenous veins, and 3) in saphenous veins, the effects of nitric oxide are reduced by endothelium-derived contracting factors originating from the cyclooxygenase pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Oral flecainide acetate was administered to 34 patients with documented symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) with a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week crossover trial design. PSVT was defined as a regular tachycardia of at least 120 beats/min without evidence of atrioventricular dissociation. The study required considerable patient cooperation. Patients first entered a 4-week qualifying phase followed by a 3-week, open label, flecainide dose-ranging phase. They were then randomized in a blind fashion to receive either placebo or tolerated flecainide dose for an 8-week treatment period and then crossed over after four symptomatic documented episodes of PSVT or at the end of the treatment period. By all efficacy parameters analyzed, flecainide was superior to placebo. Flecainide was associated with an actuarial 79% freedom from symptomatic PSVT events compared with only 15% on placebo at 60 days (p less than 0.001). Of the 34 patients, 29 had recurrence of symptomatic PSVT at least once during the placebo phase; only eight patients had a recurrence during the flecainide phase (p less than 0.001). The median time to the first symptomatic PSVT event was 11 days in the placebo group and greater than 55 days in the flecainide group (p less than 0.001). Likewise, the interval between attacks was a median of 12 days on placebo compared with more than 55 days on flecainide (p less than 0.001). Finally, the flecainide slowed symptomatic PSVT heart rates to 143 +/- 12 beats/min from 178 +/- 12 on placebo (p less than 0.02) in the seven patients who had events in the placebo and flecainide treatment phases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether there are differences in responses to thrombolytic therapy in certain populations, the data for the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (phase 1) study were analyzed for black and white patients. Baseline variables including risk factors and extent of coronary artery disease were similar in the 352 white and 24 black patients. The time from onset of chest pain to recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy and rt-PA dosing regimens were the same in the two groups. The patency rate of the infarct-related artery at 90 minutes was 91% for blacks and was 72% for whites (p = 0.051). Blacks displayed significantly lower nadir fibrinogen levels (0.57 +/- 0.62 versus 1.3 +/- 0.76 g/l, p less than 0.0001), greater delta fibrinogen (baseline-nadir) (2.7 +/- 1.1 versus 1.7 +/- 1.1 g/l, p less than 0.0001), and increased peak levels of fibrin(ogen) degradation products (837 +/- 865 versus 245 +/- 475 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.0001). rt-PA antigen levels tended to be higher in blacks than in whites (2.8 +/- 2.2 versus 2.2 +/- 3.2 micrograms/ml [p = 0.10] at the peak and 1.6 +/- 1.3 versus 0.99 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml [p = 0.06] at the end of the maintenance infusion). Major clinical outcomes including survival until time of hospital discharge (92% black versus 93% white, p = 0.68) were not significantly different.

  ".U": "91084952\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the ventricular expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in human hypertrophic hearts, we conducted an immunohistochemical study of 130 endomyocardial biopsy specimens obtained from the right side of the ventricular septum (RVB), left ventricular free wall (LVB), or both from a total of 80 patients: 44 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 14 with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (APH), 13 with hypertensive hearts (HHD), and nine without hypertrophy (controls). No patients had apparent congestive heart failure. ANP was not seen in ventricular myocytes in controls but was identified in biopsy specimens of hypertrophic hearts, and its distribution was characteristic in each hypertrophic group: 15 RVB (37%) and two LVB (7%) of the HCM group, one RVB (7%) and two LVB (18%) of the APH group, and zero RVB (0%) and five LVB (46%) of the HHD group. Clinical data (including echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and angiographic data) were not directly related to ventricular ANP expression in HCM, APH, or HHD with one exception. In HHD patients, LVB specimens with ANP showed greater ventricular wall thickness than LVB specimens without ANP. According to histological data, however, the ANP-present RVB specimens of HCM or ANP-present LVB specimens of HHD had greater myocyte size than did the ANP-absent specimens. In addition, in HCM patients, the ANP-present RVB specimens showed more severe fibrosis and myofiber disarray than did the ANP-absent specimens. We conclude that a failing state and hemodynamic overload are not likely to be indispensable for ANP expression in human hypertrophic ventricles and that ventricular ANP expression occurs as a response to disease-specific changes: hemodynamic overload in HHD and histological changes such as myocardial fiber disarray, hypertrophy of myocytes, and fibrosis in HCM, which may reflect the characteristic distribution of intraventricular ANP.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the mechanisms involved in the cardiovascular and renal response to prolonged infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in patients with chronic heart failure. ANF infusion was titrated to produce a 30% decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or a 20% increase in cardiac output, and this dose (average, 75 +/- 4 ng/kg/min) was then administered for 20 hours. The short-term response to ANF included significant reductions in central filling pressures, increases in cardiac output, modest increases in diuresis and glomerular filtration rates, significant reduction in plasma aldosterone levels, and a 3.6-fold increase in plasma cyclic GMP levels. During prolonged infusion, plasma cGMP levels and cardiac output gradually returned to baseline. Similarly, the initially increased diuretic effects were completely abolished during prolonged ANF infusion, although plasma alpha-hANF levels remained consistently elevated above baseline values (control, 198 +/- 38; titration, 2,760 +/- 596; 20 hours, 3,499 +/- 659 pg/ml). Four hours after beginning the ANF infusion, marked increases in hematocrit levels were noted (42.5 +/- 1.0% versus 45.3 +/- 1.4%, control and infusion, respectively, p less than 0.05); during this time, no change in total plasma protein concentration occurred, indicating extravascular shift of fluid and plasma proteins. No evidence was noted for activation of vasoconstrictor hormones during prolonged ANF infusion, although mean arterial pressure was significantly reduced throughout the infusion period. Plasma pro-ANF (31-67) levels, determined as a marker for endogenous ANF secretion, were significantly suppressed as were the reductions of central filling pressures. After ANF discontinuation, heart rate and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased significantly above baseline values without evidence for sympathetic stimulation. We conclude that 1) prolonged infusion of ANF causes only transient increases in plasma cGMP levels but a sustained reduction of the cardiac release of ANF and that 2) the beneficial hemodynamic effects of ANF, that is, unloading of the ventricles, may be associated with or, in part, may be secondary to a shift of plasma constituents into the extravascular space. The latter may limit the therapeutic potential of ANF for long-term treatment.\r"

Left ventricular pressure was recorded with a high-fidelity micromanometer in patients with heart disease during left ventriculography. Peak isovolumic pressure at the end-disastolic volume was estimated by a curve-fitting technique from an isovolumic left ventricular pressure curve. The ESPVR line was drawn from the estimated peak isovolumic pressure-volume point tangential to the left upper corner of the pressure-volume loop. The slope of this estimated ESPVR line from single-beat analysis was compared with the slope of the ESPVR line obtained from three pressure-volume loops in 16 patients given angiotensin II or nitroglycerin infusion. The estimated Ees was 5.0 +/- 2.2 mm Hg/ml/m2, and the conventional Ees was 4.9 +/- 2.7 mm Hg/ml/m2. The estimated Ees showed a positive correlation with the conventional Ees (r = 0.91, p less than 0.001, SEE = 1.2 mm Hg/ml/m2). In the other 13 patients, after dobutamine infusion (5 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) the estimated Ees increased significantly from 5.6 +/- 1.4 to 7.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg/ml/m2 (p less than 0.01). Thus, the estimated Ees approximated the conventional Ees and was sensitive to a positive inotropic intervention. We conclude that this single-beat analysis method facilitates assessment of the beat-by-beat ESPVR of the human heart.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of bypass surgery on outcome from unstable angina, 468 patients were randomized to medical treatment (237 patients) or surgery plus medical treatment (231 patients) and have been followed for comparison of survival, cardiac end points, and quality of life; the latter end point is discussed in the present report. Data were available at 3 and 5 years for 80% and 82% of patients in the medical group, respectively, and 77% and 80% of patients in the surgery group, respectively. At 3 months after randomization to therapy, 79.8% of patients in the surgery group reported subjective improvement, compared with 58% of the medical group, 12.6% of the surgery group reported no change compared with 24.5% of the medical group, and 5.5% of the surgery group reported worsening compared with 24.5% of the medical group (p less than 0.01 by chi 2). Similar data were found for chest pain status, and the benefit to the surgery group remained statistically significant through 5 years of follow-up. Crossover rate to surgery was 43% by 5 years. Treadmill duration was increased in the surgery group compared with the medical group (6.5 +/- 0.25 versus 5.3 +/- 0.25 minutes at 6 months, p less than 0.01), and a significant difference was again demonstrated at 3 and 5 years. A trend toward decreased recurrence of unstable angina was present in the surgery group at 1 year (six of 168 [3.6%] versus 13 of 187 [6.9%] in the medical group, p = 0.158), but the two groups were similar at 3 and 5 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Six years ago, we established a noninvasive respiratory care unit (NRCU) for selected patients in need of intensive respiratory monitoring and therapy, particularly those requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. One impetus for the formation of the NRCU was the expectation that it might prove to be a less costly alternative to the intensive care unit (ICU) for selected patients. We reviewed data from all patients admitted to the NRCU from July 1, 1987 through June 30, 1988 to identify characteristics of the patient population and to evaluate potential cost savings. During one year of operation, 136 patients were admitted to the unit, 107 of whom were mechanically ventilated. Overall, hospital costs for these patients exceeded payments by $1,519,477. Losses were greatest for mechanically ventilated patients and those for whom Medicare or Medicaid were the primary payors. Daily costs of care for mechanically ventilated patients were $1,976 lower in the NRCU than in the medical intensive care unit (MICU). We conclude that the NRCU represents a cost-effective approach to the care of substantial numbers of patients requiring specialized respiratory care.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective review of patients over a six-year period. SETTING: In- and outpatients of one University hospital and affiliated Veterans Administration Medical Center. PATIENTS: Those who were subsequently found to have either M tuberculosis or fungal infections. INTERVENTIONS: Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were compared to prebronchoscopy sputum, when available. Specimens were sent for smear and culture for both acid-fast bacilli and fungi. In the case of lavage, an aliquot also was studied for cellular differential. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: For TB, sputum was smear-positive in 6/47 (34 percent) and culture positive in 24/47 (51 percent), while bronchoscopy was smear positive in 34/50 (68 percent) and culture positive in 46/50 (92 percent). For fungal infections, no sputum was smear-positive and only 1/22 (5 percent) was sputum culture-positive, while bronchoscopy was smear-positive in 14/41 (34 percent) and culture positive in 35/41 (85 percent). Bronchoscopy washings and BAL provided complementary specimens. Eighty-three patients had adequate lavages and the cellularity was significantly different from controls (lymphocytes: TB 18 +/- 11.2 percent [mean +/- SD]; fungal: 13 +/- 11.1 percent; controls 6 +/- 3.1 percent; p less than 0.001; neutrophils: TB 9 +/- 11.5 percent; fungal: 6 +/- 9.1 percent controls: 2 +/- 1.5 percent, p less than 0.01); however, there was overlap and no pattern was characteristic for TB or fungal infections. CONCLUSION: Bronchoscopy with BAL is useful in diagnosing tuberculosis and fungal infections.\r"

Eight different antibodies that recognize at least three distinct epitopes on the lactase protein each gave the same result. Strong brush border staining was observed in all the lactase-persistent adults. No staining at all was detected in 9 of the hypolactasic subjects. In the remaining 12 individuals a mosaic pattern of expression was observed: small patches of enterocytes stained strongly, whereas the surrounding areas showed no staining at all. Sucrase-isomaltase, in contrast, showed no such mosaicism in these or in any of the other individuals. The mosaicism observed in the 12 hypolactasic individuals suggests that the differentiation of the columnar cells along the villus is not homogeneous. Furthermore, the existence of two patterns of expression of the lactase protein in the lactase-deficient individuals (i.e., absence of protein and mosaicism), if characteristic of the entire length of the intestine of the individuals tested, would suggest the existence of two phenotypes of adult-type hypolactasia in the population studied.\r"

At weaning, the amount of lactase messenger RNA dropped specifically in the distal ileum. This decrease in lactase messenger RNA was initiated at the ileocecal junction, progressed gradually towards the jejunum, and followed the decrease in lactase activity several days later. Starvation and refeeding were also found to cause modifications of lactase activity and messenger RNA expression that were prominent in the distal part of small intestine. These data support that posttranscriptional and pretranslational levels of regulation are required to define the spatial and temporal expression of lactase in the rat small intestine.\r"

The relative importance of these variables on active Na+ and Cl- absorption has not been defined. Isolated, stripped ileal segments were studied under short-circuited conditions in the Ussing flux chamber. Unidirectional 22Na and 36Cl fluxes were measured after changes in bathing solution pH, PCO2, and/or [HCO3-]. When pH was decreased from 7.6 to 7.1, net flux of Na+ increased from 0.1 +/- 0.7 to 2.6 +/- 0.7 mu Eq/cm2 per hour and net flux of Cl- increased from -2.0 +/- 0.9 to 1.3 +/- 0.6 mu Eq/cm2 per hour. These changes were rapid in onset, completely reversible, and accounted for by changes in mucosal-to-serosal fluxes of these ions. They were accompanied by small decreases in short-circuit current, but there were no changes in residual flux. These pH effects were not inhibited by the presence of luminal bumetanide (1 mmol/L), furosemide (1 mmol/L), hydroflumethiazide (1 mmol/L), or 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (1 mmol/L), or by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor methazolamide (1 mmol/L). When data from all combinations of acid-base conditions were combined and analyzed by linear regression, pH was the only variable that correlated with mucosal-to-serosal fluxes (r = -0.84) and net flux (r = -0.85) for Na+, mucosal-to-serosal fluxes (r = -0.96) and net flux (r = -0.99) for Cl-, and short-circuit current (r = 0.97). These findings suggest that extracellular pH modulates active Na+ and Cl- absorption in the rabbit ileum.\r"

However, oral synthetic and conjugated estrogens increase biliary cholesterol saturation index and risk of gallstone disease. To examine whether transdermal estrogen administration could avoid these adverse effects, 17 postmenopausal women were treated with transdermal estradiol (Estraderm TTS; Ciba-Geigy, Arnhem, The Netherlands), 100 micrograms/day for 4 weeks, and after 1 month without therapy, with oral estradiol (Progynova; Schering, Weesp, The Netherlands), 2 mg/day for 4 weeks. The increase in the serum estradiol level was much higher during transdermal than oral estradiol administration. On the contrary, the increase in the serum estrone level was much more pronounced during oral treatment. Both modes of treatment led to a similar reduction of urinary calcium excretion. A highly significant decrease in serum phosphate levels was found during transdermal therapy. Biliary cholesterol saturation index did not change during transdermal therapy (mean +/- SEM, 1.25 +/- 0.06 before and 1.22 +/- 0.07 at the end of transdermal therapy; P = NS). A slight increase in cholesterol saturation index that did not reach statistical significance was found during oral therapy (1.28 +/- 0.09 before and 1.36 +/- 0.09 during oral treatment). However, the subgroup of women with strong increases in serum estrone levels during oral estradiol therapy (greater than 0.5 pmol/mL; n = 8) generally had increased biliary cholesterol saturation index, a decrease in relative percentage chenodeoxycholic acid in bile, and increased serum sex hormone-binding globulin levels during oral treatment. Cholesterol monohydrate crystals were never found in duodenal biles during either treatment. This study indicates that transdermal estradiol does not induce lithogenic bile. On the contrary, oral estradiol leads to lithogenic bile in a subgroup of women with strong increases in serum estrone levels during oral treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Results of previous studies from our laboratory suggest that bradykinin has a role in the exercise pressor reflex elicited by static muscle contraction. The purpose of this study was to quantify the release of bradykinin from contracting skeletal muscle. In 18 cats, blood samples were withdrawn directly from the venous effluent of the triceps surae muscles immediately before and after 30 s of static contraction producing peak muscle tensions of 33, 50, and 100% of maximum electrically stimulated contraction. Contractions producing muscle tensions of 50 and 100% of maximum increased muscle venous bradykinin levels by 27 +/- 9 and 19 +/- 10 pg/ml, respectively. Conversely, 33% maximum contraction did not alter muscle venous bradykinin concentrations. However, when captopril was administered to slow the degradation of bradykinin, muscle venous bradykinin increased from 68 +/- 15 pg/ml at rest to 106 +/- 18 after contractions of 33% of maximum. When muscle ischemia was induced by 2 min of arterial occlusion before and during 30 s of 33% of maximum contraction, muscle venous bradykinin increased by 15 +/- 5 pg/ml. In addition, contraction-induced changes in muscle venous pH and lactate strongly correlated with bradykinin concentrations (r = 0.80 and 0.83, respectively). These data demonstrate that static contraction of relatively high intensity evokes the release of bradykinin from skeletal muscle and that ischemia, decreased pH, and increased lactate are strongly correlated with this release.\r"

  ".U": "91086264\r", 
  ".W": "Our objective was to test the hypothesis that exposure to prolonged hypoxia results in altered responsiveness to chemoreceptor stimulation. Acclimatization to hypoxia occurs rapidly in the awake goat relative to other species. We tested the sensitivity of the central and peripheral chemoreceptors to chemical stimuli before and after 4 h of either isocapnic or poikilocapnic hypoxia (arterial PO2 40 Torr). We confirmed that arterial PCO2 decreased progressively, reaching a stable value after 4 h of hypoxic exposure (poikilocapnic group). In the isocapnic group, inspired minute ventilation increased over the same time course. Thus, acclimatization occurred in both groups. In goats, isocapnic hypoxia did not result in hyperventilation on return to normoxia, whereas poikilocapnic hypoxia did cause hyperventilation, indicating a different mechanism for acclimatization and the persistent hyperventilation on return to normoxia. Goats exposed to isocapnic hypoxia exhibited an increased slope of the CO2 response curve. Goats exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia had no increase in slope but did exhibit a parallel leftward shift of the CO2 response curve. Neither group exhibited a significant change in response to bolus NaCN injections or dopamine infusions after prolonged hypoxia. However, both groups demonstrated a similar significant increase in the ventilatory response to subsequent acute exposure to isocapnic hypoxia. The increase in hypoxic ventilatory sensitivity, which was not dependent on the modality of hypoxic exposure (isocapnic vs. poikilocapnic), reinforces the key role of the carotid chemoreceptors in ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated rat lungs were perfused with suspensions containing normal and stiffened erythrocytes (RBCs) during normoxic and hypoxic ventilation to assess the effect of reduced RBC deformability on the hypoxic pressor response. RBC suspensions were prepared with cells previously incubated in isotonic phosphate-buffered saline with or without 0.0125% glutaraldehyde. The washed RBCs were resuspended in isotonic bicarbonate-buffered saline (with 4% albumin) to hematocrits of approximately 35%. The lungs were perfused with control and experimental cell suspensions in succession while pulmonary arterial pressure was measured during normoxic (21% O2) and hypoxic (3% O2) ventilation. On the attainment of a peak hypoxic pressor response, flow rate was changed so that pressure-flow curves could be constructed for each suspension. RBC deformability was quantified by a filtration technique using 4.7-microns-pore filters. Glutaraldehyde treatment produced a 10% decrease in RBC deformability (P less than 0.05). Over the range of flow rates, Ppa was increased by 15-17% (P less than 0.05) and 26-31% (P less than 0.05) during normoxic and hypoxic ventilation, respectively, when stiffened cells were suspended in the perfusate. The magnitude of the hypoxic pressor response was 50-54% greater with stiffened cells over the three flow rates. In a separate set of experiments, normoxic and hypoxic arterial blood samples from conscious unrestrained rats were used to investigate the effects of acute hypoxia on RBC deformability. Deformability was measured with the same filtration technique. There was no difference in the deformability of hypoxic compared with normoxic RBCs. We conclude that the presence of stiffened RBCs enhances the hemodynamic response to hypoxia but acute hypoxia does not affect RBC deformability.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a potential causative agent of hypoxic respiratory depression by monitoring the response of the phrenic neurogram to systemic infusion of the GABA antagonist bicuculline (0.01 mg.kg-1.min-1) under control conditions and during isocapnic brain hypoxia produced by CO inhalation in separate groups of anesthetized, glomectomized, vagotomized, paralyzed, and ventilated cats with blood pressure held constant. The maximum effect of bicuculline in subseizure doses in control cats was to increase minute phrenic activity to 151 +/- 14% of preinfusion values. Infusion was continued until seizure activity was seen in the electroencephalogram. A 53% decrease of arterial O2 content resulted in a marked reduction of both peak phrenic amplitude and phrenic firing frequency to 16 and 64% of control values, respectively. Infusion of bicuculline while the level of hypoxia was maintained constant restored both peak phrenic amplitude and phrenic firing frequency to prehypoxic levels. The maximum effect of bicuculline was to increase minute phrenic activity to 123 +/- 13% of the prehypoxic value. These results suggest that although GABA has only a modest role in determining the output of the control phrenic neurogram, a significant portion of the phrenic depression that occurs during hypoxia can be attributed to inhibition of respiratory neurons by GABA.\r"

Escherichia coli endotoxin (055-B5) was infused intravenously into anesthetized 10- to 14-wk-old pigs at 5 micrograms/kg the 1st h followed by 2 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 for 3 h in the presence and absence of LY171883, a specific leukotriene D4 (LTD4)/LTE4 receptor antagonist. Endotoxin caused hemoconcentration, granulocytopenia, decreased cardiac index, systemic hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, bronchoconstriction, hypoxemia, increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane, pulmonary edema, and increased plasma concentrations of thromboxane B2 (TxB2), prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. LY171883 did not modify endotoxin-induced cardiopulmonary and hematologic abnormalities, except for a modest attenuation of pulmonary hypertension (at 1 h) and increased pulmonary vascular resistance (at 1-2 h). Ex vivo stimulation of whole blood with calcium ionophore caused large increases in plasma concentrations of TxB2, PGF2 alpha, and LTB4. These increases were not significantly modified in blood derived from pigs treated with LY171883, indicating no inhibition of cyclooxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase. We conclude that LTD4 and LTE4 are not important mediators of endotoxin-induced lung injury in anesthetized pigs, although they may contribute modestly to pulmonary vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced acute lung injury was studied in isolated constant-flow blood-perfused rabbit lungs. PMA caused a 51% increase in pulmonary arterial pressure (localized in the arterial and middle segments as measured by vascular occlusion pressures), a 71% increase in microvascular permeability (measured by the microvascular fluid filtration coefficient, Kf), and a nearly threefold increase in perfusate thromboxane (Tx) B2 levels. Cyclooxygenase inhibition with three chemically dissimilar inhibitors, indomethacin (10(-7) and 10(-6) M), meclofenamate (10(-6) M), and ibuprofen (10(-5) M), prevented the Kf increase without affecting the pulmonary arterial pressure increase or resistance distribution changes after PMA administration. The specific role of TxA2 was investigated by pretreatment with OKY-046, a specific Tx synthase inhibitor, or infusion of SQ 29548, a TxA2 receptor antagonist; both compounds failed to protect against either the PMA-induced permeability or the vascular resistance increase. These results indicate that cyclooxygenase-mediated products of arachidonic acid other than TxA2 mediate the PMA-induced permeability increase but not the hypertension.\r"

Invest. 79:867-874; Silverstein, R. L., A. S. Asch, and R. L. Nachman. 1989. J. Clin. Invest. 84:546-552). We reproduced the results when RPMI cell culture medium, but not when HBSS was used as binding medium. Addition of 1 mM Ca2+ to RPMI medium increased the binding of TSP to suspended U937 cells more than eightfold; the increase was blocked by EDTA but not by heparin. Further studies showed that addition of 1 mM Ca2+ to RPMI medium resulted in an insoluble precipitate, which did not form when EDTA was present or when 1 mM extra Ca2+ was added to HBSS. TSP bound to the precipitate in a saturable and specific manner. The precipitate enhanced binding of TSP to MG63 osteosarcoma cells in a monolayer binding assay. Enhancement of binding in the monolayer assay was observed for fibronectin and vitronectin as well. Our data indicate that there is not a specific Ca2(+)-dependent TSP receptor on U937 cell surface. Instead, the extra binding enhanced by Ca2+ is due to the formation of insoluble salts in the medium.\r"

  ".U": "91086447\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms by which T lymphocytes acquire the capacity to produce interleukin 4 (IL-4) and other lymphokines during intrathymic and extrathymic development are poorly understood. To gain insight into this process, we determined the capacity of human neonatal and adult T lineage cell populations to produce IL-4 after polyclonal activation. IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production were studied in parallel, since their production by neonatal T cells is known to be similar or diminished, respectively, compared to adult T cells. Production of IL-4 by neonatal CD4+ T cells and IFN-gamma by neonatal CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was markedly lower compared with analogous adult cell populations, whereas IL-2 production was similar. Transcription of IL-4, as determined by nuclear run-on assays, and IL-4 mRNA-containing cells, as determined by in situ hybridization, were undetectable in neonatal T cells, whereas both were detectable in adult T cells. IFN-gamma transcription and IFN-gamma mRNA-containing cells were reduced in neonatal T cells compared with adult T cells. Reduced lymphokine production by neonatal T cells correlated with their lack of a CD45R- (putative memory T cell) population; cells with this surface phenotype comprised 30-40% of the adult CD4+ T cells and were highly enriched for IL-4 and IFN-gamma, but not IL-2 production. IL-4, IFN-gamma, and IL-2 mRNA expression by neonatal CD4+CD8- thymocytes was similar to that found in circulating neonatal CD4+ T cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the extrathymic generation of memory T cells during postnatal life may result in an increased capacity for IL-4 and IFN-gamma gene expression. In addition, IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNA were significantly more abundant than IL-4 mRNA in activated neonatal CD4+CD8- thymocytes and CD4+ T cells, as well as adult CD4+ CD45R- T cells. Therefore, the capacity of T lineage cells to express the IL-4 gene may be more restricted compared to other lymphokine genes beginning in intrathymic development. This restricted capacity appears to persist during postnatal extrathymic maturation of T cells.\r"

AP126ir could be detected in the cellular extract and the medium from cultured kidney cells of neonatal and adult rats using an enzyme immunoassay specific for cardiac AP prohormone. On reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, the AP obtained from the extract and the medium comigrated with cardiac AP prohormone. Incubation of the renal AP in the medium with thrombin resulted in the generation of a single low molecular mass peak which migrated with the cardiac carboxy-terminal 28-amino acid AP. Neonatal kidney cells pulsed with [35S]methionine secreted radiolabeled AP126ir, which was detected by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis chromatography. Incubation of neonatal kidney cell cultures with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide resulted in a significant decrease in both the cellular and media AP. No decrease in cellular and media AP was detected when neonatal atrial cultures were treated with cycloheximide. These data demonstrate the de novo synthesis of an AP prohormone-like protein in neonatal rat kidney cultures. Furthermore, unlike the atria, kidney cells appear to secrete AP solely by constitutive means. In primary adult rat kidney cultures, most of AP126ir was detected in the cortical tubule fraction demonstrating that these cells secrete AP126ir in the adult rat kidney. We hypothesize that the renal AP may be important as an autocrine or paracrine regulator of renal function.\r"

  ".U": "91086452\r", 
  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that mononuclear cells are stimulated to release interleukin 1 (IL-1) by bone fragments released in the bone microenvironment during the remodeling cycle, we have investigated the effects of bone matrix and some of its constituents on IL-1 secretin from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Increases in IL-1 activity were observed when either PBMC or adherent monocytes, but not lymphocytes depleted of monocytes, were co-cultured with either human or rat bone particles but not with latex particles of similar size. Co-culture of PBMC with bone particles in a transwell system where the cells were physically separated from the bone particles, or with osteoblast- or osteoclast-covered bone particles, did not stimulate IL-1 release, indicating that a physical contact between PBMC and the bone surface is required for eliciting IL-1 release. This was confirmed by the finding of a lower stimulatory effect of bone particles pretreated with etidronate, a bisphosphonate which decreases the bone binding capacity of PBMC. Constituents of bone matrix, such as collagen fragments, hydroxyproline, and, to a lesser extent, transforming growth factor-beta, but not osteocalcin, alpha 2HS glycoprotein, fragments of either bone sialoprotein or osteopontin, and fibronectin, stimulated PBMC IL-1 release in a dose-dependent fashion. Collagen-stimulated IL-1 release was partially and specifically inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha 2 beta 1-integrin cell surface collagen receptor. These data demonstrate that products of bone resorption, known to be chemotactic for mononuclear cells, stimulate PBMC IL-1 activity. These findings may help explain previous documentation of increased IL-1 secretion by circulating monocytes obtained from patients with high turnover osteoporosis.\r"

  ".U": "91086461\r", 
  ".W": "The melanoma cell line FO-1 does not express HLA class I antigens and does not acquire them on the cell surface after incubation with IFN-gamma. Immunochemical studies showed that FO-1 cells synthesize HLA class I heavy chain, but do not synthesize beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-mu). The latter abnormality is associated with lack of beta 2-mu mRNA which remains undetectable in FO-1 cells incubated with IFN-gamma. The defect was identified as a genetic lesion in the B2m gene, since DNA hybridization analysis detected a deletion of the first exon of the 5'-flanking region, and of a segment of the first intron of the B2m gene. HLA class I antigen expression was reconstituted on melanoma cells FO-1 after transfection with the wild-type mouse B2m gene, thereby confirming the abnormality of the endogenous B2m gene. The defect identified in FO-1 cells is distinct from that underlying the lack of HLA class I antigen expression by lymphoblastoid cells Daudi, but is remarkably similar to that causing lack of H-2 class I antigen expression by mouse lymphoblastoid cells R1 (TL-). These results suggest that genetic recombination in the 5' region of the B2m gene is a recurrent mechanism in B2m gene defects. In addition to contributing to our understanding of molecular abnormalities in HLA class I antigen expression by melanoma cells, FO-1 cells represent a useful model for analyzing the role of HLA class I antigens in the biology of melanoma cells and in their interaction with cells of the immune system.\r"

  ".U": "91086462\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported that there is a global reduction in adenylyl cyclase associated with a decrement in Gs functional activity in cardiac sarcolemma from animals with pressure overload-induced hypertrophy and heart failure. This study was performed to determine whether hypertrophy alone in the absence of heart failure is sufficient to promote these changes and whether the superimposition of heart failure intensified these changes. Basal and stimulated adenylyl cyclase and Gs activity, as determined in the S49 cyc- reconstitution assay, were measured in sarcolemma from normal (NL), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and heart failure (HF) animals. Simultaneously, we measured the mRNA level encoding for the Gs alpha subunit. These studies indicate that Gs activity and Gs alpha mRNA are decreased by approximately 30% both in the failing heart and even in the heart with compensated hypertrophy before heart failure develops (Gs activity, pmol cyclic AMP/10 min per microgram, NL 4.2 +/- 0.4, LVH 3.0 +/- 0.2, HF 3.2 +/- 0.3; Gs alpha mRNA, pg/10 micrograms RNA, NL 131 +/- 9.0, LVH 104 +/- 7.4, HF 97.4 +/- 9.1; P less than 0.05 as compared with NL for LVH and HF). Accompanying this decrement in Gs activity is a fall in adenylyl cyclase, both basal and stimulated. However, we also identified a further decrease in adenylyl cyclase without any additional change in Gs or in its alpha subunit mRNA level. This is seen only in the sarcolemma from animals with heart failure as compared with those with compensated LV hypertrophy (e.g., NaF-stimulated activity, pmol cyclic AMP/min per mg, NL 420.2 +/- 17.5, LVH 347.1 +/- 29.6, HF 244.2 +/- 27.3; P less than 0.05 compared with NL for LVH and HF, P less than 0.05 compared with LVH for HF). In summary, these studies indicate that both Gs and adenylyl cyclase activities fall in parallel with the development of LV hypertrophy followed by a further decrement in adenylyl cyclase, independent of Gs, in the setting of heart failure.\r"

  ".U": "91086464\r", 
  ".W": "Since physiological concentrations (0.1-1 microM) of adenosine influence the functions of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), we investigated the metabolism of adenosine in suspensions of stimulated and unstimulated PMNs. Stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 1 microM), but not by zymosan (0.5 mg/ml) or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP, 1 microM), provoked an accumulation of endogenous adenosine at a rate of 2.3 +/- 1.0 amol/cell per minute. A similar accumulation was observed with both unstimulated and stimulated PMNs after the addition of deoxycoformycin (dCF, 1-100 microM), an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. Exogenous adenosine (10 microM) was deaminated at a rate of 9.8 +/- 3.7 amol/cell per minute in control or zymosan or fMLP-stimulated PMN suspensions. This deamination was nearly completely suppressed when the PMNs had been stimulated with PMA. In contrast, the activity of adenosine deaminase in PMN lysates (231 +/- 72 amol/cell per minute) was not modified by PMA stimulation. alpha, beta-Methyleneadenosine 5'-diphosphate (AMPCP, 2.5 mM), an inhibitor of membranous ecto-5'-nucleotidase, profoundly inhibited endogenous adenosine accumulation under all conditions. PMA stimulation also provoked an inactivation of extracellular adenosine deaminase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and lactate dehydrogenase in PMN suspensions. We concluded that PMNs, even when not stimulated, continuously produce adenosine by dephosphorylation of extracellularly released adenylates; and that stimulation of PMNs by PMA causes adenosine accumulation owing to the inactivation of adenosine deaminase released by broken cells.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic data of recent years have identified an important role of HDL deficiency in the etiology of atherosclerosis. Biochemical data suggest that some of these deficiencies may be a consequence of defects in the structural genes of HDL apolipoproteins or of plasma enzymes that modify HDL. We analyzed the genetic defect in a 42-yr-old patient suffering from corneal opacities and complete absence of HDL cholesterol but not of coronary artery disease, thus clinically resembling fish eye disease. The observation of an abnormal immunoblot banding pattern of apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and of reduced lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity in plasma led to sequence analysis of the genes for apo A-I and LCAT in this patient and his family. Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA segments containing the exons of the candidate genes, resulted in the identification of a frameshift mutation in apo A-I while the LCAT sequence was identical to the wild type. The apo A-I mutation was predictive for an extensive alteration of the COOH-terminal sequence of the encoded protein. Evidence for the release of this mutant protein into the plasma compartment and for the absence of normal apo A-I was derived from ultraviolet laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analysis. Our results suggest that a defective apo A-I is the causative defect in this case of HDL deficiency with corneal opacities.\r"

The product was electrophoresed and viewed under ultraviolet light after ethidium bromide staining. Specimens from 26 B cell lymphomas produced a monoclonal band in 24 cases and no amplification in two cases; monoclonality was specific for this disorder. Specimens from seven T cell lymphomas produced no amplification; specimens from nine reactive nodes produced a broad smear of polyclonal material; and specimens from 12 cases of carcinoma produced either no amplification or polyclonal material. As detection of monoclonality is strongly suggestive of neoplastic disease, this technique is likely to be of value in routine diagnosis, because of its speed, simplicity, and applicability to fixed, embedded material.\r"

Researchers have sought to replace these older H1-receptor antagonists with a new generation of H1-receptor antagonists that approach the optimal therapy: clinically effective, safe, free of side effects, and convenient for the patient. Among the new second-generation H1-receptor antagonists are terfenadine and astemizole (already marketed) and loratadine and cetirizine, which are expected to be approved soon. All four demonstrate efficacy, convenience, and minimal side effects on the central nervous system.

Cetirizine is a major metabolite of hydroxyzine that has little anticholinergic activity and causes significantly less sedation. In addition, it can be given once a day. In placebo-controlled comparisons with terfendadine, both active drugs were comparably effective and significantly better than placebo in relieving sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal itching. In a multicenter, double-blind comparison with placebo, both cetirizine, 10 and 20 mg given once daily, were similarly effective and superior to placebo in reducing the overall symptoms of rhinitis. In another multicenter, double-blind study, cetirizine was comparable with diphenhydramine and significantly superior to placebo in reducing total symptom severity, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and ocular itching. The safety of cetirizine was demonstrated in all studies. Cetirizine tended to be less sedating than diphenhydramine.\r"

  ".W": "Antigen and cold dry air were used to challenge the upper and lower airways, skin, and conjunctiva. In each of these four systems an immediate and late-phase reaction to antigen is well characterized. Although the pattern of mediator release is different in these four areas, the degree of infiltration of basophils and eosinophils in the late-phase reaction appears to be constant. Of a number of drugs that can influence these mediators and cell responses, the steroids represent a typical mode of action. Steroids block the late-phase response and ablate the eosinophil and basophil infiltration. Although the effects of antihistamines appear to be similar, they do not appear to be caused by H1 antagonism; the mechanism of their action is unknown. This discussion will focus on these non-H1 antagonist effects of antihistamines in four challenge models, particularly the upper airways and skin.\r"

Terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and cetirizine produce an incidence of central nervous system and anticholinergic adverse effects similar to that produced by placebo.

The present study was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these guidelines. Data from an intermediate mental health care institution in Champaign/Urbana, Illinois, were used. The analysis considered the direct costs and benefits accrued over a 3-year period and a range of transmission rates. At a 3-year transmission rate of 0.030, the screening and vaccination policy cost $7300 per case of hepatitis B avoided (or $345,800 per hepatitis B fatality avoided). At a more likely 3-year transmission rate of 0.271, the screening and vaccination policy cost $300 per case of hepatitis B avoided (or $12,100 per hepatitis B fatality avoided). Either way, the active prevention policy compares very well with the amounts of money spent by the US Government on other life-saving programs. A general cost-effectiveness model is given that can be adapted for institution-specific analyses at other mental health care facilities.\r"

We found that a proportion of human astrocytes from each of fifteen individual donors expressed HLA-DR under basal culture condition; while this proportion differed among the human subjects (range 3-65%), the results for each individual remained relatively constant when analyzed at several time points (up to 125 days in vitro). Attempts to modulate HLA-DR expression by a variety of cytokines likely to be present in inflammatory infiltrates in the brain showed that only gamma-interferon could increase the proportion of human astrocytes that expressed HLA-DR. Whether the variability of HLA-DR expression on astrocytes between different individuals reflects a genetic trait which can influence susceptibility to autoimmune central nervous system diseases remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Receptor-mediated arachidonic acid release and its relationship to phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C activation were investigated in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with and expressing the m5 muscarinic receptor. Carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist, stimulated the release of arachidonic acid and inositol phosphates with similar potencies. In addition, carbachol and the phorbol ester, phorbol-12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA), stimulated protein kinase C (PKC) activity. PMA potentiated the carbachol-stimulated release of arachidonic acid, but had no effect on release of inositol phosphates. Long-term preincubation with PMA or carbachol inhibited PKC activity and prevented carbachol-stimulated release of arachidonic acid, but not inositol phosphates, suggesting that release of arachidonic acid, but not release of inositol phosphates, required activation of PKC. Carbachol stimulated the release of [3H]lysophosphatidylcholine from [3H]choline prelabeled cells, suggesting that phospholipase A2 was involved in the release of arachidonic acid. The role of calcium in carbachol-stimulated release of arachidonic acid was also investigated. Carbachol stimulated a transient followed by a sustained increase in intracellular calcium. In the absence of extracellular calcium, the transient rise in intracellular calcium was maintained but the sustained increase in intracellular calcium and the release of arachidonic acid were abolished. Carbachol stimulated a sustained influx of 45Ca++. We conclude that the combined effect of PKC activation and sustained elevation of intracellular calcium, from an extracellular source, is essential for m5 muscarinic receptor activation of phospholipase A2.\r"

  ".U": "91087153\r", 
  ".W": "Short-term administration of atrial peptides has been reported to improve renal function in several animal models of acute renal failure. We designed experiments that determined the effect of a 13-amino acid analog of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), A68828, on renal function in the postischemic model of acute renal failure. Experiments were conducted using euvolemic, male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) under Inactin anesthesia. Acute renal failure was induced by complete occlusion of both renal arteries for 30 min. After release of the clamp, vehicle (0.1% bovine serum albumin in saline), A68828 (3, 10 or 30 micrograms/kg/min), dopamine (10 micrograms/kg/min), A68828 (10 micrograms/kg/min) plus dopamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) or ANF (1-28) (0.5 micrograms/kg/min) were infused i.v. for a 2-h period. A68828 at 10 micrograms/kg/min produced a significant increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared with vehicle controls (0.39 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g; P less than .05) despite a lower arterial pressure (87 +/- 5 vs. 101 +/- 5 mm Hg; P less than .05). A subpressor dose of dopamine had no effect on GFR during the postischemic period (0.25 +/- 0.11 ml/min/100 g). Dopamine in combination with A68828 prevented the decrease in arterial pressure seen with A68828 alone but did not potentiate the beneficial effects on GFR (0.28 +/- 0.05 ml/min/100 g). ANF (1-28) at 0.5 micrograms/kg/min increased GFR to levels nearly identical to those induced by A68828 (0.40 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g). These results indicate that infusion of a reduced-size analog of ANF improves renal function in the immediate postischemic period. Furthermore, prevention of the hypotensive effects of the analog with dopamine provides no additional beneficial effect.\r"

  ".W": "Caffeine (0.1-10 mM) produced a biphasic effect on Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity in the rat heart sarcolemmal preparations. The Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity was stimulated by about 25% at low concentrations (0.1-1 mM), whereas the enzyme was inhibited by about 25% at higher concentrations (10 mM) of caffeine. The stimulatory effect of 1 mM caffeine was associated with about 30% increase in the Vmax value for Na(+)-K+ ATPase, whereas the depressant action of 10 mM caffeine was associated with an increase of the Km value from 1.4 to 2.1 mM ATP. The Na(+)-induced Ca++ release from the sarcolemmal vesicles was stimulated with caffeine in a concentration-dependent manner; about 80% increase in the activity was observed at 0.1 mM caffeine. The apparent Ka (millimolar Na+) values for the Na(+)-induced Ca++ release were about 17 and 6 in the absence and presence of 1 mM caffeine, respectively. However, the sarcolemmal Na(+)-dependent Ca++ uptake and ATP-independent Ca++ binding were not affected, whereas the ATP-dependent Ca++ accumulation and Ca+(+)-stimulated ATPase activities were depressed by 1 to 10 mM caffeine. This agent at concentrations of 0.1 to 10 mM produced a biphasic effect on the contractile activity of the isolated perfused rat heart. The initial transient positive inotropic (30-60%) effect was followed by a sustained negative inotropic (50-80%) response of the drug; the delayed decrease in contractile force was associated with a significant increase (35-50%) in the resting tension. The initial positive inotropic effect of caffeine was dependent on the concentration of Ca++ (0.2-3 mM) in the perfusion medium; however, this response was attenuated either by lowering the concentration of Na+ from 140 to 35 mM or by different concentrations (0.5-1 mM) of amiloride in the medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These compounds were also tested on the systemic arterial blood pressure of rats and dogs. KP-10614 was the most potent inhibitor of in vitro platelet aggregation induced by ADP with IC50 of 1 nM among the compounds studied in this report, and it also showed ex vivo effectiveness at doses much lower than the other three compounds. KP-10614 was also orally active. At oral doses of 25, 50 and 100 micrograms/kg, this new compound caused a dose-dependent inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation in rats, whereas the other three compounds were effective only at 500 micrograms/kg or more. In addition, KP-10614 showed definite antithrombotic effects at a dose range of 0.1 to 1 microgram/kg i.v. in various thrombosis models in which platelet aggregation was mainly involved. These results indicate that KP-10614 possesses therapeutic potential in thrombotic diseases.\r"

The mean apparent clearance after a low GTN i.v. dose (0.025 mg/kg) was 1440 ml/min/kg (S.D. = 630), which decreased to 686 ml/min/kg (S.D. = 317) after a high GTN i.v. dose (0.25 mg/kg), demonstrating dose-dependent pharmacokinetics. Bioavailability of oral GTN (0.25 mg/kg) was very low (0.015 +/- 0.019). The formation of dinitrate metabolites was rapid and extensive after i.v. and oral dosing of GTN. The pharmacokinetics of 1,2-GDN and 1,3-GDN were very similar. The dinitrates exhibited longer half-lives (approximately 45 min) and lower apparent clearances (approximately 16 ml/min/kg) than those found for GTN. The apparent fractional GTN clearances to 1,2-GDN (CLapp,m1) and 1,3-GDN (CLapp,m2) were also determined. The CLapp,m1 decreased significantly (P less than .05) in going from the low GTN dose (1030 +/- 620 ml/min/kg) to the high dose (425 +/- 145 ml/min/kg). In contrast, CLapp,m2 remained unchanged (low dose: 107 +/- 55 ml/min/kg; high dose: 115 +/- 37 ml/min/kg). The duration of systolic blood pressure decrease after low i.v. GTN doses was very short (approximately 15 min) and significantly longer (approximately 90 min) for high i.v. GTN doses. GTN is about 10 to 12 times more efficient than 1,2-GDN and 1,3-GDN in terms of the maximal systolic blood pressure decrease produced by a therapeutic dose. Oral GTN is pharmacodynamically active and this effect can be attributed to the formation of high levels of dinitrate metabolites.\r"

  ".W": "Pravadoline is a novel cyclooxygenase-inhibiting analgesic with a preclinical profile of activity in vivo clearly distinct from that of other cyclooxygenase inhibitors. The purpose of the present study was to assess the possibility that pravadoline possesses pharmacologic actions in addition to inhibition of cyclooxygenase. The data demonstrate that pravadoline inhibits neuronally stimulated contractions of the guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens preparations. These actions of pravadoline are not shared by known cyclooxygenase inhibitors, but are mimicked by close structural analogs of pravadoline devoid of the ability to inhibit prostaglandin formation. Some structural analogs were inhibitory also in the rat vas deferens preparation. The inhibitory effects of pravadoline and a representative noncyclooxygenase-inhibiting analog in isolated tissue preparations are not mediated by an interaction with muscarinic cholinergic, adrenergic (alpha-1 or alpha-2), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine2 or 5-hydroxytryptamine3), opioid (mu, kappa or delta), purinergic (P1), neurokinin-1, bradykinin (B2) or prostaglandin (E2) receptors. It is concluded that pravadoline and aminoalkylinodole analogs are inhibitory in several bioassay systems via a presynaptic mechanism which does not involve inhibition of cyclooxygenase, or the activation or inhibition of several known receptors. The relevance of this mechanism to aminoalkyindole actions in vivo is the subject of future studies.\r"

Ro 41-1049 (50, 100 and 250 nM) was found to produce a concentration-dependent increase of newly formed DA (36-56% increase) and reduced 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic (DOPAC) formation (45-86% reduction). Ro 19-6327 (50, 100 and 250 nM) was found not to affect the accumulation of newly formed DA up to 50 microM L-dopa in the medium, but significantly reduced the formation of DOPAC. At the concentration of 100 microM L-dopa, Ro 19-6327 (100 and 250 nM) significantly increased (by 32 and 132%, respectively), the DA tissue levels in kidney slices. Ro 19-6327 (100 and 250 nM) was found to decrease (30-70% reduction) DOPAC formation; this effect was also observed when tissues were incubated with L-dopa at concentrations lower than 50 microM. It is concluded that both MAO-A and MAO-B are important in the metabolism of newly formed DA in kidney slices incubated with exogenous L-dopa. The results also suggest that there at least two compartments in which newly formed DA can be deaminated.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that the methylxanthine theophylline and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) have similar actions in the kidney was tested. Doses of equal natriuretic potency were administered to seven healthy men during maximal water diuresis. Theophylline (1.2 mg/kg/min) increased sodium excretion to 3-fold, increased glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction and had no effect on estimated renal plasma flow. Increments were also found in maximal urine flow, distal delivery index and fractional lithium clearance. Diluting segment reabsorption index decreased, and minimal urine osmolality increased. ANP, of which the dose was low (0.01 micrograms/kg/min), had similar effects on sodium excretion, glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, minimal urine osmolality and diluting segment reabsorption index, but it decreased estimated renal plasma flow and had no effect on distal delivery and fractional lithium clearance. In a third clearance study ANP was infused after 3 days of treatment with theophylline. The only difference observed was that theophylline prevented the ANP-induced fall in estimated renal plasma flow. Theophylline did not enhance the natriuretic effect of ANP nor its effect to stimulate urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Pretreatment with theophylline had raised plasma renin activity, but the effect of ANP to lower plasma renin activity was not diminished. Our observations agree with the idea that theophylline and ANP act via common mechanisms in the kidney. However, ANP effects are independent of theophylline's action.\r"

  ".W": "The respiratory effects of several benzodiazepine (BZ) agonists and inverse agonists were compared with those of buspirone and pentobarbital in awake rhesus monkeys. Subjects, fitted with a helmet that served as a pressure displacement plethysmograph, were studied in a ventilated, sound-attenuating chamber; ventilatory frequency, tidal volume (VT) and minute volume (VE) were determined from the plethysmograph signal. During experimental sessions monkeys inhaled either 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) mixed in air or air alone according to a fixed alternating schedule. BZ agonists (alprazolam, 0.01-1.0 mg/kg; lorazepam, 0.3-10.0 mg/kg; quazepam, 1.0-5.6 mg/kg) decreased VT and VE during both 5% CO2 and air inhalation. Pentobarbital (3.0-30.0 mg/kg) also decreased VT and VE and additionally decreased respiratory frequency in monkeys breathing 5% CO2. Two BZ inverse agonists, the beta-carbolines beta-CCE and FG 7142 (0.3-5.6 or 10.00 mg/kg), increased frequency and had no effect on VT, resulting in an increase in VE in monkeys breathing either 5% CO2 or air. The weak BZ inverse agonist CGS 8216 (0.3-5.6 mg/kg) similarly increased ventilation only in monkeys breathing air. Buspirone (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), like the beta-carbolines, increased frequency and VE and, like the BZ agonists, decreased VT. The BZ antagonist Ro15-1788 (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) had little or no effect on ventilation, but Ro15-1788 and also CGS 8216 (both at 1.0 mg/kg) attenuated the respiratory depressant effects of lorazepam or alprazolam. In turn, alprazolam (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) and quazepam (1.0-3.0 mg/kg) attenuated the respiratory stimulant effects of FG 7142.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Inasmuch as sustained treatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) agonist, ipsapirone, is necessary for inducing anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in the clinic, investigations were performed for assessing the possible changes in serotoninergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain of rats 24 hr after a 2-week treatment with this drug. Receptor binding assays with membranes and quantiative autoradiography indicated that the twice-daily administration of ipsapirone (5 mg/kg i.p.) for 14 days did not alter the characteristics of 5-HT1A sites in the hippocampus, septum and dorsal raphe nucleus. In contrast, significant decreases in the Bmax values for 5-HT2 sites (-24%) and 5-HT3 sites (-19%) were found in the frontal and posterior cortex, respectively. As expected from unchanged postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase by 5-HT1A agonists (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, ipsapirone) exhibited the same characteristics in hippocampal homogenates from both control and ipsapirone-treated animals. An acute administration of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) or ipsapirone (1 or 5 mg/kg i.p.) 24 hr after the last injection for the chronic treatment produced a similar decrease in the rate of 5-HT turnover in various brain areas in rats treated for 2 weeks with saline or ipsapirone. At the highest dose (5 mg/kg i.p.), acute ipsapirone also increased the rate of dopamine turnover in the striatum and cerebral cortex approximately to the same extent in both treatment groups. In vitro recording of the firing of serotoninergic neurons in brain stem slices revealed a desensitization of the somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors, which might be responsible for the increased 5-HT turnover in the brain stem and striatum of rats chronically treated with ipsapirone as compared with controls. These data demonstrated that chronically administered ipsapirone produces adaptive changes in central serotoninergic neurotransmission which might account for the anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of this drug after sustained treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Amiodarone has been shown to produce microvesicular steatosis of the liver in some recipients. We have determined the effects of amiodarone on the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids in mice. In vitro, the formation of 14C-acid-soluble beta-oxidation products from [U-14C]palmitic acid by mouse liver mitochondria was decreased by 92% in the presence of 125 microM amiodarone and by 94% in the presence of 125 microM N-desethylamiodarone. Inhibition due to 100 or 150 microM amiodarone persisted in the presence of 5 mM acetoacetate, whereas acetoacetate totally relieved inhibition due to 15 microM rotenone. In vivo, exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [U-14C]palmitic acid was decreased by 31, 40, 58 and 78%, respectively, in mice receiving 19, 25, 50 and 100 mg.kg-1 of amiodarone hydrochloride 1 hr before the administration of [U-14C]palmitic acid. One hour after 100 mg.kg-1, the exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [1-14C]palmitic acid, [1-14C]octanoic acid or [1-14C]butyric acid was decreased by 78, 72 and 53%, respectively. Exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [1-14C]palmitic acid was normal between 6 and 9 hr after administration of 100 mg.kg-1 of amiodarone hydrochloride, but was still inhibited by 71 and 37%, 24 and 48 hr after 600 mg.kg-1. Twenty four hours after the latter dose of amiodarone, hepatic triglycerides were increased by 150%, and there was microvesicular steatosis of the liver. We conclude that amiodarone inhibits the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids and produces microvesicular steatosis of the liver in mice.\r"

Unlabeled dihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines and benzothiazepines inhibited (-)-[3H]D888 specific binding in a concentration-dependent manner. Scatchard analyses and dissociation kinetics of (-)-[3H]D888 binding revealed the existence of mutual allosteric interactions between (+)-isradipine, (+)-cis diltiazem and (-)-D888 binding sites in portal vein strips. When voltage-dependent Ca++ channels transported Ca++, Ba++, Sr++ or Na+ the binding capacity of (-)-[3H]D888 remained unchanged. In contrast, both depolarization (induced by elevation of external K+) and hyperpolarization (in the presence of cromakalim) induced a gradual decrease in (-)-D888 binding capacity. These observations suggest that membrane potential variation would change the conformational state of Ca++ channels, in such a way that it would be less favorable for access of (-)-[3H]D888 to the binding site. This would provide an experimental argument in favor of the \"guarded receptor hypothesis\" according to which membrane potential modulates ligand affinity by alteration of the amount of time during which the receptor binding site is available to (-)-[3H]D888.\r"

Cromakalim provoked a concentration-dependent reduction in 86Rb outflow. This inhibitory effect was attenuated in islets exposed throughout to glibenclamide or to a Ca+(+)-free medium. In islets exposed to glucose and extracellular Ca++, cromakalim induced a dose-dependent reduction in 45Ca outflow. The drug also inhibited the increase in 45Ca outflow mediated by K+ depolarization. Lastly, cromakalim elicited a concentration-dependent inhibition of insulin release from islets perifused in the presence of glucose and extracellular Ca++. The present data suggest that the paradoxical inhibitory effect of cromakalim on 86Rb outflow probably reflects the capacity of the drug to reduce the activity of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels and to indirectly inhibit the Ca+(+)-activated K+ channels. Furthermore, the cromakalim-induced changes in 45Ca outflow are compatible with an inhibitory effect of the drug on the voltage-dependent Ca++ channels.\r"

Fluoxetine injections during ad libitum feeding led to depressed food intake and body weight in both obese and lean mice over the initial 10 days of treatment with full recovery of both intake and weight by the end of the study. Fluoxetine treatment of mice restricted to 3.2 g of laboratory diet per day caused small but persistent depressions of body weight in both phenotypes. RU-486 did not affect food intake weight or weight gain in either phenotype or feeding condition and neither drug affected carcass composition. Insulin levels were also unaffected by treatment but final corticosterone concentrations were consistently higher in fluoxetine-treated mice and lower in RU-486-treated mice. Although transient benefits on feeding and weight gain were observed with fluoxetine administration, the present results show that neither fluoxetine nor RU-486 administered parenterally provides significant long-term improvement in the metabolic, growth or behavioral disturbances that characterize ob/ob mice.\r"

Second DNA preparations from their stored cerebrospinal fluid samples were all PCR negative, suggesting that the false-positive results were due to cross-contamination. 18 PCR-positive TBM samples retested were all still PCR positive.

  ".U": "91087822\r", 
  ".W": "The transmission of tuberculosis is a recognized risk in health-care settings. Several recent outbreaks of tuberculosis in health-care settings, including outbreaks involving multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have heightened concern about nosocomial transmission. In addition, increases in tuberculosis cases in many areas are related to the high risk of tuberculosis among persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Transmission of tuberculosis to persons with HIV infection is of particular concern because they are at high risk of developing active tuberculosis if infected. Health-care workers should be particularly alert to the need for preventing tuberculosis transmission in settings in which persons with HIV infection receive care, especially settings in which cough-inducing procedures (e.g., sputum induction and aerosolized pentamidine [AP] treatments) are being performed. Transmission is most likely to occur from patients with unrecognized pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis who are not on effective antituberculosis therapy and have not been placed in tuberculosis (acid-fast bacilli [AFB]) isolation. Health-care facilities in which persons at high risk for tuberculosis work or receive care should periodically review their tuberculosis policies and procedures, and determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk of tuberculosis transmission in their particular settings. The prevention of tuberculosis transmission in health-care settings requires that all of the following basic approaches be used: a) prevention of the generation of infectious airborne particles (droplet nuclei) by early identification and treatment of persons with tuberculous infection and active tuberculosis, b) prevention of the spread of infectious droplet nuclei into the general air circulation by applying source-control methods, c) reduction of the number of infectious droplet nuclei in air contaminated with them, and d) surveillance of health-care-facility personnel for tuberculosis and tuberculous infection. Experience has shown that when inadequate attention is given to any of these approaches, the probability of tuberculosis transmission is increased. Specific actions to reduce the risk of tuberculosis transmission should include a) screening patients for active tuberculosis and tuberculous infection, b) providing rapid diagnostic services, c) prescribing appropriate curative and preventive therapy, d) maintaining physical measures to reduce microbial contamination of the air, e) providing isolation rooms for persons with, or suspected of having, infectious tuberculosis, f) screening health-care-facility personnel for tuberculous infection and tuberculosis, and g) promptly investigating and controlling outbreaks. Although completely eliminating the risk of tuberculosis transmission in all health-care settings may be impossible, adhering to these guidelines should minimize the risk to persons in these settings.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Familial male precocious puberty is a gonadotropin-independent form of precocious puberty that occurs only in males. The cause of the disorder is unknown. To examine the hypothesis that the plasma of boys with familial male precocious puberty contains a novel stimulator of testicular testosterone production, we developed a bioassay using adult male cynomolgus monkeys. METHODS. We collected plasma from 12 boys with familial male precocious puberty, 7 normal prepubertal boys of similar ages and with similar plasma gonadotropin levels, and 1 boy with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and infused it into the testicular artery of adult male cynomolgus monkeys that had been pretreated with gonadotropin-releasing-hormone antagonist to inhibit the endogenous secretion of gonadotropins. Testicular venous effluent was collected at 15-minute intervals for 3 or 5 hours for the measurement of testosterone. RESULTS. The mean (+/- SE) peak testosterone response, as compared with base line, was significantly greater in the monkeys infused with plasma from the 12 boys with familial male precocious puberty than in the monkeys infused with plasma from the 7 normal prepubertal boys and the boy with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (385 +/- 51 vs. 184 +/- 25 percent, P less than 0.005) in the three-hour studies. Plasma from 92 percent of the boys with familial male precocious puberty and 12.5 percent of the normal prepubertal boys stimulated a response greater than 195 percent of base-line values. In the animals studied for five hours after receiving a second dose of antagonist, the mean peak testosterone response, as compared with base line, was significantly greater in the monkeys infused with plasma from three boys with familial male precocious puberty than in the monkeys infused with plasma from three normal prepubertal boys (363 +/- 81 vs. 115 +/- 6 percent, P less than 0.01). The mean area under the testosterone-response curve was significantly larger in the monkeys infused with plasma from the boys with familial male precocious puberty in the five-hour studies (154 +/- 34 vs. -58 +/- 10 percent, P less than 0.005), but not in the three-hour studies. CONCLUSIONS. These findings support the presence of a circulating testis-stimulating factor in the plasma of boys with familial male precocious puberty. The production of such a factor would explain the biologic nature of the disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin is produced and secreted by the B cells in the endocrine pancreas. In vivo, insulin secretion is under the control of a number of metabolic, neural and hormonal substances. It is now clear that stimulation of insulin release by fuel secretagogues, such as glucose, involves the closure of K+ channels that are sensitive to the intracellular ATP concentration (KATP channels). This leads to membrane depolarization and the generation of Ca2(+)-dependent action potentials. The mechanisms whereby hormones and neurotransmitters such as adrenaline, galanin and somatostatin, which are released by intraislet nerve endings and the pancreatic D cells, produce inhibition of insulin secretion are not clear. Here we show that adrenaline suppresses B-cell electrical activity (and thus insulin secretion) by a G protein-dependent mechanism, which culminates in the activation of a sulphonylurea-insensitive low-conductance K+ channel distinct from the KATP channel.\r"

  ".W": "Low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins are strong candidates for regulators of membrane traffic. In yeast, mutations in the sec4 or ypt1 genes encoding small GTP-binding proteins inhibit constitutive membrane flow at the plasma membrane or Golgi complex, respectively. It has been suggested that membrane fusion-fission events are regulated by cycling of small GTP-binding proteins between a membrane-bound and free state, but although most of these small proteins are found in both soluble and tightly membrane-bound forms, there is no direct evidence to support such cycling. In rat brain a small GTP-binding protein, rab3A, is exclusively associated with synaptic vesicles, the secretory organelles of nerve terminals. Here we use isolated nerve terminals to study the fate of rab3A during synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We find that rab3A dissociates quantitatively from the vesicle membrane after Ca2(+)-dependent exocytosis and that this dissociation is partially reversible during recovery after stimulation. These results are direct evidence for an association-dissociation cycle of a small GTP-binding protein during traffic of its host membrane.\r"

CSF levels of IFN-gamma and serum and CSF levels of neopterin were higher in HIV+ than in HIV- individuals. Patients with HIV- related meningitis and with opportunistic CNS infections had higher serum neopterin levels than HIV+ asymptomatic individuals. CSF levels of IFN-gamma were slightly higher in CSF of HIV+ individuals in all groups (0.31 +/- 0.03 U/ml) than in HIV- individuals (0.12 +/- 0.03). CSF levels of neopterin were similar in HIV+ asymptomatic individuals (6.9 +/- 0.7 nmol/l) and HIV- individuals (5.9 +/- 1.1), but were elevated in those HIV-infected individuals with neurologic disease, particularly patients with HIV-associated meningitis (72.1 +/- 13.3 nmol/l), opportunistic CNS infections (36 +/- 9.1), and inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (32.4 +/- 17.2). Levels of neopterin correlated positively with levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor and soluble CD8, 2 additional indicators of immune activation. In the absence of neurologic disease, levels of IFN-gamma and neopterin in both serum and CSF were stable for up to 4 years after seroconversion. These data suggest that increased CSF neopterin is associated with HIV-associated neurologic disease.\r"

Acute exacerbations of concomitant inflammatory periodontal diseases can result in systemic infections in these patients. However, host-oral bacterial relationships in the periodontium in patients with ANLL are not well understood. Twenty-one adult patients with ANLL with periodontal disease ranging from gingivitis to severe periodontitis were studied. Supragingival and subgingival plaque specimens were collected before chemotherapy (prechemotherapy), and at a defined midpoint of myelosuppression (midchemotherapy; day 14). All specimens were extensively cultured both aerobically and anaerobically. Data were submitted to a partial correlational analysis, controlling for covariation relation to oral hygiene intervention and antibiotic administration. Levels of total yeast exhibited a significant association with Staphylococcus sp. at supragingival sites midchemotherapy (r = 0.68, p less than or equal to 0.05). Levels of total yeast also correlated positively with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at subgingival sites both prechemotherapy (r = 0.70, p less than or equal to 0.01) and midchemotherapy (r = 0.61, p less than or equal to 0.05). Significant correlations of levels of Veillonella sp. with Neisseria sp. and gram-negative enteric bacilli were observed in both supragingival (r = 0.95, 0.77, p values less than or equal to 0.01) and subgingival (r = 0.69, 0.61, p values less than or equal to 0.05) plaque specimens midchemotherapy but not prechemotherapy. These data suggest that potentially pathogenic bacteria occur in plaque simultaneous with granulocytopenia in these patients. Multiple mechanisms, including intergeneric coaggregation and other symbiotic relationships, may influence infectivity of the mixed plaque flora and thus contribute to the oral ecology observed in these patients.\r"

Four of these constructs retained beta-galactosidase activity despite the insertion of the cleavage cassette. Of these four constructs, one was cleaved by HIV protease, resulting in the inactivation of beta-galactosidase both in vivo and in vitro. This cleavage was inhibited by pepstatin A, a known inhibitor of HIV protease. Thus, beta-galactosidase has been converted into an easily assayed substrate for HIV protease. An analogous construct of beta-galactosidase containing a polio protease cleavage site was cleaved likewise by polio protease, suggesting that this system may be generic for monitoring cleavage by a variety of proteases.\r"

In addition, we have found that these cells express, after activation with interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide, an inducible Ca2(+)-independent NO synthase that is distinct from the constitutive enzyme. The generation of NO by this enzyme was detectable after a lag period of 2 hr, reached a maximum between 6 and 12 hr, and was maintained for the duration of the experiment (48 hr). The expression of the inducible NO synthase was inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, a compound that had no direct effect on the activity of either of the two enzymes. Furthermore, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone, but not progesterone, inhibited the expression of the inducible enzyme, without directly affecting the activity of either enzyme, without directly affecting the activity of either enzyme. The effect of these steroids was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by cortexolone, a partial agonist of glucocorticoid receptors. Thus, the inhibition of the induction of an NO synthase by glucocorticoids is a receptor-mediated event involving the inhibition of the synthesis of mRNA for de novo synthesis of this enzyme. The induction of this NO synthase may contribute to the pathophysiology of immunologically based conditions. Furthermore, the inhibition of this induction by anti-inflammatory steroids may explain some of the therapeutic and adverse effects of these compounds.\r"

  ".W": "Kinesin is a microtubule-activated ATPase that moves objects toward the plus end of microtubules and makes microtubules glide along a glass surface. Here we investigate a remarkable effect of the nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate (p[NH]ppA), on kinesin-driven microtubule gliding. Microtubule gliding that has been blocked by rapid replacement of ATP with p[NH]ppA requires 1-2 min of exposure to ATP before microtubule gliding resumes. This latency is not shortened by prolonged washing of p[NH]ppA-blocked microtubules in nucleotide-free buffer for up to 15 min, suggesting that ATP binding to a second nucleotide binding site on kinesin triggers the release of bound p[NH]ppA. To test this hypothesis, the release of [3H]p[NH]ppA from kinesin-microtubule complexes was followed in parallel biochemical assays. In nucleotide-free buffer, the bound p[NH]ppA was released over several hours from the complexes. However, addition of ATP caused the release of p[NH]ppA from the kinesin-microtubule complexes within 2 min, which was similar to the latent period for start-up of microtubule gliding after p[NH]ppA inhibition. The stoichiometry of p[NH]ppA bound per kinesin heavy chain at saturation was estimated to be approximately 1:2. These results suggest a model in which each molecule of kinesin has at least two nucleotide binding sites that alternately bind nucleotide.\r"

  ".U": "91088545\r", 
  ".W": "Previous in vivo studies have shown that delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal active ingredient in marijuana, can suppress both luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH) secretion after its injection into the third ventricle of conscious male rats. The present studies were designed to determine the mechanism of these effects. Various doses of THC were incubated with either stalk median eminence fragments (MEs) or mediobasal hypothalamic (MBH) fragments in vitro. Although THC (10 nM) did not alter basal release of LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) from MEs in vitro, it completely blocked the stimulatory action of dopamine or norepinephrine on LHRH release. The effective doses to block LHRH release were associated with a blockade of synthesis and release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from MBH in vitro. In contrast to the suppressive effect of THC on LHRH release, somatostatin release from MEs was enhanced in a dose-related manner with a minimal effective dose of 1 nM. Since PGE2 suppresses somatostatin release, this enhancement may also be related to the suppressive effect of THC on PGE2 synthesis and release. We speculate that these actions are mediated by the recently discovered THC receptors in the tissue. The results indicate that the suppressive effect of THC on LH release is mediated by a blockade of LHRH release, whereas the suppressive effect of the compound on growth hormone release is mediated, at least in part, by a stimulation of somatostatin release.\r"

  ".W": "By using a recently developed in vitro transcription assay, the 16S/23S rRNA-encoding DNA promoter from the archaebacterium Sulfolobus sp. B12 was dissected by deletion and linker substitution mutagenesis. The analysis of 5' and 3' deletion mutants defined a core promoter region between positions -38 and -2 containing all information for efficient and specific transcription. Further characterization of this region by linker substitution mutagenesis indicated two sequence elements important for promoter function--one located between positions -38 and -25 (distal promoter element) and the other one located between positions -11 and -2 (proximal promoter element). The distal promoter element encompassed the TATA-like \"box A\" element located approximately 26 nucleotides upstream of the majority of transcription start sites in archaebacteria (Archaeobacteria). All mutations within this box A motif virtually abolished promoter function. Complete inactivation of the proximal promoter element was dependent on extensive mutagenesis; this element is not conserved between archaebacterial promoters except for a high A + T content in stable RNA gene promoters from Sulfolobus. Mutants containing insertions or deletions between the distal and proximal promoter elements were only slightly affected in their transcription efficiency but displayed a shift in their major initiation site, retaining an essentially fixed distance between the distal promoter element and the transcription start site. Thus, efficient transcription and start-site selection were dependent on a conserved TATA-like sequence centered approximately 26 nucleotides upstream of the initiation site, a situation unlike that of eubacterial promoters but resembling the core structure of most eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (and some RNA polymerase III) promoters. This finding suggests a common evolutionary origin of these promoters consistent with the known similarities between archaebacterial and eukaryotic RNA polymerases.\r"

Binding sites for TRH are present in these tissues, but the TRH receptor (TRH-R) has not been purified from any source. Using Xenopus laevis oocytes in an expression cloning strategy, we have isolated a cDNA clone that encodes the mouse pituitary TRH-R. This conclusion is based on the following evidence. Injection of sense RNA transcribed in vitro from this cDNA into Xenopus oocytes leads to expression of cell-surface receptors that bind TRH and the competitive antagonist chlordiazepoxide with appropriate affinities and that elicit electrophysiological responses to TRH with the appropriate concentration dependency. Antisense RNA inhibits the TRH response in Xenopus oocytes injected with RNA isolated from normal rat anterior pituitary glands. Finally, transfection of COS-1 cells with this cDNA leads to expression of receptors that bind TRH and chlordiazepoxide with appropriate affinities and that transduce TRH stimulation of inositol phosphate formation. The 3.8-kilobase mouse TRH-R cDNA encodes a protein of 393 amino acids that shows similarities to other guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein-coupled receptors.\r"

Of the virulence region-encoded proteins of the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of A. tumefaciens, the VirD1 and VirD2 proteins are essential for T-DNA transfer to plant cells. These two proteins have been shown to be directly responsible for the formation of T-strands. VirD2 was also shown to be firmly attached to the 5' termini of T-strands; these facts have led to its postulation as a pilot protein in the T-DNA transfer process and as a nucleus-targeting signal in plants. We have constructed a chimeric gene by fusing the virD2 gene and the Escherichia coli lacZ gene. Cell fractionation and electron microscopy studies with transgenic tobacco plants containing the VirD2-LacZ fusion protein indicate that the first 292 amino acids of VirD2 are able to direct the cytoplasmic protein beta-galactosidase to the plant nucleus. This provides an example of cross-kingdom nuclear localization between two free-living organisms: a bacterial peptide is capable of acting as a eukaryotic (plant) nuclear targeting signal.\r"

The comparative study revealed (i) the extremely low saturation level of transitional differences, (ii) recombination or variable substitution rates even within species, (iii) long persistence times of distinct types of mtDNA in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana, and (iv) an apparent lack of within-type variations in island species. Also found was a high correlation among the transitional rate, the saturation level, and the G + C content (or codon usage). It appears that D. simulans and D. mauritiana have maintained highly structured populations for more than 1 million years. Such structures are consistent with the origination of Drosophila sechellia from D. simulans. Yet geographic isolation is so weak as to show no evidence for further speciation. Moreover, one type of mtDNA shared by D. simulans and D. mauritiana suggests either recent divergence or ongoing introgression.\r"

Transient expression of the genes was obtained in liver, skin, and muscle tissues of rat and mouse bombarded in vivo. Similar results were obtained with freshly isolated ductal segments of rat and human mammary glands and primary cultures derived from these explants. Gene transfer and transient expression were also observed in eight human cell culture lines, including cells of epithelial, endothelial, fibroblast, and lymphocyte origin. Using CHO and MCF-7 cell cultures as models, we obtained stable gene transfer at frequencies of 1.7 x 10(-3) and 6 x 10(-4), respectively. The particle bombardment technology thus provides a useful means to transfer foreign genes into a variety of mammalian somatic cell systems. The method is applicable to tissues in vivo as well as to isolated cells in culture and has proven effective with all cell or tissue types tested thus far. This technology may therefore prove to be applicable in various aspects of gene therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The Escherichia coli F1 ATPase, ECF1, has been examined by cryoelectron microscopy after reaction with Fab' fragments generated from monoclonal antibodies to the alpha and epsilon subunits. The enzyme-antibody complexes appeared triangular due to the superposition of three anti-alpha Fab' fragments on alternating densities of the hexagonally arranged alpha and beta subunits. The Fab' to the epsilon subunit superimposed on a beta subunit. A density was observed near the center of the structure in the internal cavity. The position of this central density with respect to peripheral sites was not fixed. Sorting of images of ECF1 labeled with the combination of three anti-alpha Fab' fragments plus an Fab' directed to the epsilon subunit gave three classes in each of which the central density was closest to a different beta subunit. The distribution of the central density among the three classes was measured for different ligand-binding conditions. When ATP was present in catalytic sites under conditions where there was no enzyme turnover (i.e., without Mg2+ present), there were approximately equal numbers of images in each of three classes. When ATP and Mg2+ were added and ATP hydrolysis was allowed to proceed, almost two-thirds of the images were in the class in which the central density was closest to the beta subunit superimposed by the epsilon subunit. We conclude that domains within the ECF1 structure, either the central mass or a domain including the epsilon subunit, move in the enzyme in response to ligand binding. We suggest that this movement is involved in coupling catalytic sites to the proton channel in the F0 part of the ATP synthase.\r"

RAS2 proteins having a C-terminal Cys-Ali-Ali-Xaa sequence (where Ali is an aliphatic amino acid and Xaa is the unspecified C-terminal amino acid) served as substrates for this reaction, whereas RAS2 proteins with an altered or deleted Cys-Ali-Ali-Xaa sequence did not. A yeast mutant, dpr1/ram1, originally isolated as a Ras-processing mutant was shown to be defective in farnesyltransferase activity. In addition, another mutant, ram2, also was defective in the transferase activity. These results demonstrate that at least two genes, DPR1/RAM1 and RAM2, are required for the farnesyltransferase activity in yeast.\r"

Adult melanogaster flies that are homozygous for the Slow allozyme have approximately twice the level of ADH activity and crossreacting material as simulans adults. There is no corresponding difference in ADH mRNA, however, so this difference in ADH protein level is evidently due to a difference in the rate of translation of the two RNAs and/or to a difference in protein stability. Here we report an interspecific gene-transfer experiment, using P-element transformation, to determine whether this expression difference is due to genetic background differences between the species (trans-acting modifiers) or to cis-acting factors within the Adh gene. When the Adh genes from D. melanogaster and D. simulans are put into the same genetic background, there is no detectable difference in their level of expression. The level is relatively high in the melanogaster background and relatively low in the simulans background. Therefore, the interspecific difference in Adh expression is due entirely to trans-acting modifiers, in spite of the many sequence differences between the Adh genes of the two species, which include two amino acid substitutions.\r"

  ".W": "During sporulation of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcription of genes encoding spore coat proteins in the mother-cell compartment of the sporangium is controlled by RNA polymerase containing the sigma subunit called sigma K. Based on comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of sigma K with the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding sigma K (sigK), the primary product of sigK was inferred to be a pro-protein (pro-sigma K) with 20 extra amino acids at the N terminus. Using antibodies generated against pro-sigma K, we have detected pro-sigma K beginning at the third hour of sporulation and sigma K beginning about 1 hr later. Even when pro-sigma K is expressed artificially during growth and throughout sporulation, sigma K appears at the normal time and expression of a sigma K-controlled gene occurs normally. These results suggest that pro-sigma K is an inactive precursor that is proteolytically processed to active sigma K in a developmentally regulated fashion. Mutations that block forespore gene expression block accumulation of sigma K but not accumulation of pro-sigma K, suggesting that pro-sigma K processing is a regulatory device that couples the programs of gene expression in the two compartments of the sporangium. We propose that this regulatory device ensures completion of forespore morphogenesis prior to the synthesis in the mother-cell of spore coat proteins that will encase the forespore.\r"

Transfection-based methods for the study of these organisms have recently been developed, and we have now designed an expression vector, pX, which contains only 2.3 kilobases of Leishmania DNA and can be stably transfected with high efficiency. Genes encoding Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase or a Leishmania amazonensis protective membrane glycoprotein (GP46A/M-2) were inserted into the pX expression site and transfected into Leishmania major, where they directed the synthesis of high levels of mRNAs formed by 5' and 3' processing events occurring predominantly at the sites used by the normal transcripts. Colony assays and immunoblot analysis showed that both proteins were produced; enzymatically active beta-galactosidase comprised approximately 1% of total protein. Sizes of the GP46A protein synthesized in transfected L. major or L. amazonensis were similar and differed from the predominant L. amazonensis GP46, suggesting that the GP46A gene may encode a variant GP46 family member. Because these vectors function efficiently in pathogenic species of Leishmania, pX will facilitate the genetic analyses of parasite proteins crucial for infectivity as well as the identification of cis-acting elements mediating transcription and replication.\r"

  ".W": "Two copies of structurally related genes (CAH1 and CAH2) for carbonic anhydrase (EC 4.2.1.1) were found to be tandemly clustered on the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome. The previously isolated cDNA clones for carbonic anhydrase polypeptides were derived from the upstream gene, CAH1, which has 10 introns in its coding region. The downstream gene, CAH2, also has 10 introns, at positions identical to those of CAH1. Although amino acid sequences deduced from the two genes showed 91.8% identity, partial sequences of the authentic enzyme isolated from air-induced cells were identical only to those of the CAH1 product. Northern hybridization using gene-specific probes showed that the level of 2.0-kilobase CAH1 mRNA increased in response to a decrease in CO2 concentration in the presence of light. The CAH1 mRNA did not accumulate when CO2 was lowered in the dark. In contrast, the level of 2.0-kilobase CAH2 mRNA decreased in response to lowering of CO2 and increased upon transfer to the high-CO2 condition in light. The decrease of CAH2 mRNA under the low-CO2 condition was not observed in the dark. The fully induced mRNA level was much higher for CAH1 than for CAH2. These results indicate that CAH1 is a gene coding for the major periplasmic carbonic anhydrase whose level of transcript is rapidly induced under the low-CO2 condition in the presence of light, and that CAH2 may encode another periplasmic isozyme, which is made under the high-CO2 condition.\r"

The galactose acceptor sites are available for glycosylation only after permeabilization of right-side-out vesicles prepared from kidney outer medulla; therefore, the oligosaccharide moieties are facing the cytoplasm of the cell. We further show that the oligosaccharides are bound to asparagine residues of the alpha-subunit polypeptide, since the protein-carbohydrate linkage is hydrolyzed by peptide-N glycosidase F (an enzyme specific for N-linked sugars). Thus, the Na(+)-pump alpha subunit is a glycoprotein with its N-linked oligosaccharide moieties located at the cytosolic face of the cell membrane. Intrinsic membrane glycoproteins with such an oligosaccharide-protein linkage and cell membrane orientation have not been previously reported, to our knowledge.\r"

Comparison of the sequences of these clones to those of human DRB genes revealed a striking amino acid homology between the hypervariable residues of SLA-DRBc and the human DRB1-0101 allele. The percentage of differences in these residues between the pig DRBc allele and the human DRB1-0101 allele was significantly lower (29%) than that between the DRB1-0101 allele and all other human alleles (average, 66.2%). This similarity was not seen in a comparison of the number of silent substitutions, by which the swine DRBc and the human DRB-0101 differed. Since phenotypic selection operates at the level of protein products rather than nucleotide sequences, these data suggest the existence of selective mechanisms that have resulted in similar hypervariable regions in certain alleles even in these widely disparate species. Consistent with this hypothesis, an examination of available murine and bovine class II sequences revealed a homology in hypervariable residues between the human DRB1-1401 allele and the mouse E beta s allele as well as a cow DRB allele. Consideration of these data along with intraspecies allelic sequence comparisons suggests that at least some of the interspecies similarities have emerged as the result of convergent evolution, possibly as the result of a need to react to common pathogens.\r"

We describe here a general method for identifying and isolating peptide antigens that specifically stimulate sensitized lymphocytes. First, Salmonella typhimurium C5 genomic DNA fragments were subcloned into Escherichia coli by use of the lambda gt11 expression vector. Next, antigens expressed by recombinant phage from this genomic library were tested for their capacity to stimulate proliferative responses in pooled lymphocytes obtained from BALB/c mice infected 14 days earlier with S. typhimurium. Of 2000 recombinant phages tested, 5 stimulated a polypeptide-antigen-specific proliferative response. Physical analyses of these 5 recombinant phages revealed cloned inserts of 0.5-2.4 kilobase pairs representing nonoverlapping regions of the C5 chromosome. Four of the five insert DNAs hybridized at high stringency to both S. typhimurium and Salmonella typhi total chromosomal DNA, suggesting that these pathogens of different host specificity share several antigenic determinants. Use of sensitized primary polyclonal lymphocytes provides a rapid and simple method for screening recombinant DNA libraries for clones that stimulate specific immune responses and avoids the use of cloned lymphocyte cell lines. This approach should be generally applicable to similar studies in different hosts of many other microbial pathogens.\r"

The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein is very similar to those of various members of the ras superfamily of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, including the N-, Ki-, and Ha-ras proteins (30-35% identical), the rho proteins (approximately 50% identical), and the rac proteins (approximately 70% identical). The highest degree of sequence identity (80%) is found with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-division-cycle protein CDC42.

Upon the addition of Ca2+, the nuclease cleaves DNA at sites adjacent to the homopurine tract. Specific double-strand cleavage occurred predominantly at A + T-rich sites to the 5' side of the homopurine tract for both the 5'-derivatized and the 5',3'-diderivatized nucleases; the 3'-derivatized nuclease gave no cleavage. The cleavage pattern is asymmetric and consists of multiple cleavage sites shifted to the 5' side on each strand, centered at the terminal base pair of the binding site. Microgram amounts of plasmid pDP20 DNA (4433 base pairs) containing a homopurine-homopyrimidine tract were selectively cleaved by a semisynthetic nuclease with greater than 75% efficiency at room temperature within 1 hr.

This blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast follows blood oxygen changes induced by anesthetics, by insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and by inhaled gas mixtures that alter metabolic demand or blood flow. The results suggest that BOLD contrast can be used to provide in vivo real-time maps of blood oxygenation in the brain under normal physiological conditions. BOLD contrast adds an additional feature to magnetic resonance imaging and complements other techniques that are attempting to provide positron emission tomography-like measurements related to regional neural activity.\r"

Nucleotide sequence analysis of the toxR upstream region has revealed that the heat shock gene htpG, encoding the bacterial homologue of the eukaryotic Hsp90 protein, was located immediately upstream and was divergently transcribed from toxR. Using lacZ transcriptional fusions, we have shown that neither toxR nor htpG expression was regulated by ToxR. However, the growth temperature had a coordinate but reciprocal effect on the expression from both the toxR and htpG promoters in V. cholerae; the decrease of toxR expression between 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C was proportional to the increase of htpG expression observed within that temperature range. A similar pattern of expression of the htpG and toxR promoters was observed in the heterologous host Escherichia coli, where this regulation was controlled by the level of the E. coli rpoH (htpR) gene product, sigma-32. Consistent with the temperature-regulated expression of the V. cholerae htpG promoter in E. coli, a sequence similar to the consensus sequence of the E. coli heat shock promoters was detected upstream from the V. cholerae htpG gene. We propose a model in which the regulation of toxR expression by temperature is controlled by the level of sigma-32 (RpoH) RNA polymerase.\r"

The mutation, a G-to-A transition at the first nucleotide of the last intron, causes missplicing of the HP-1 mRNA. This suggests that heterochromatin-specific proteins play a central role in the gene suppression associated with heterochromatic position effects.\r"

A monoclonal antibody, mAb25.4, which recognizes an epitope in the amino-terminal region of p24, has been purified to homogeneity from ascites fluid and digested with papain to produce the respective antigen-binding fragment (Fab). The Fab25.4 was purified from the digestion mixture and separated into two distinct isoelectric forms. The two Fab species were each complexed with one isoelectric form of the recombinant p24 by incubating equimolar quantities of the two proteins. Two different crystal morphologies of the p24-Fab25.4 complex were obtained by the vapor-diffusion method with 12-24% PEG 3350 as the precipitant. One of these crystal forms has unit-cell parameters of a = 92.1 A, b = 85.4 A, c = 54.0 A, alpha = gamma = 90.0 degrees and beta = 90.4 degrees and belongs to the monoclinic space group P2(1), with one molecule of the complex per asymmetric unit.

  ".U": "91088637\r", 
  ".W": "Osteocalcin, a bone-specific protein and marker of the mature osteoblast, is expressed only in nonproliferating osteoblasts in a mineralizing extracellular matrix, while type I collagen is expressed in proliferating cells. The nuclear proteins encoded by the c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes are expressed during the proliferation period of osteoblast phenotype development. We present evidence that AP-1 (HeLa cell-activating protein 1) sites residing within two promoter elements of the osteocalcin gene bind the Fos-Jun protein complex: the osteocalcin box (OC box; nucleotides -99 to -76), which contains a CCAAT motif as a central element and influences tissue-specific basal levels of osteocalcin gene transcription, and the vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE; nucleotides -462 to -440), which mediates enhancement of osteocalcin gene transcription. Gel electrophoretic mobility-shift analysis demonstrated high AP-1 binding activity in proliferating osteoblasts and dramatic changes in this activity after the down-regulation of proliferation and the initiation of extracellular-matrix mineralization in primary cultures of normal diploid osteoblasts. Methylation interference analysis established at single nucleotide resolution that purified recombinant Fos and Jun proteins bind in a sequence-specific manner to the AP-1 sites within the VDRE and OC box. Similarly, an AP-1 motif within a putative VDRE of the alkaline phosphatase gene, which is also expressed after the completion of proliferation, binds the Fos-Jun complex. These results support a model in which coordinate occupancy of the AP-1 sites in the VDRE and OC box in proliferating osteoblasts may suppress both basal level and vitamin D-enhanced osteocalcin gene transcription as well as transcription of other genes associated with osteoblast differentiation--a phenomenon we describe as phenotype suppression. This model is further supported by binding of the Fos-Jun complex at an AP-1 site in the type alpha I collagen promoter that is contiguous with, but not overlapping, the VDRE. Such a sequence organization in the collagen VDRE motif is compatible with vitamin D modulation of collagen but not with osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase expression in proliferating osteoblasts.\r"

We investigated the efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator in reducing cerebral infarct size after thromboembolic stroke in a rabbit model. Seventeen rabbits were randomized to receive either tissue plasminogen activator (2.5 mg/kg, n = 6) or vehicle control (n = 11). We controlled mean arterial pressure, hematocrit, and arterial blood gases before and after the intracarotid embolization of an autologous clot. Cerebral blood flow (cm3/100 g/min) (mean +/- SEM) was immediately reduced from 55.2 +/- 7.7 to 8.5 +/- 2.5 in the control group and from 61.8 +/- 14.8 to 10.0 +/- 3.5 in the treated group after embolization. Cerebral blood flow recovered significantly within 60 minutes of thrombolytic therapy and attained a value of 59.6 +/- 10.0 cm3/100 g/min 4 hours after embolization, whereas cerebral blood flow in control animals demonstrated only a minimal recovery to 15.3 +/- 8.9 cm3/100 g/min. Cerebral infarct size (percent of hemisphere) was reduced from 34.4 +/- 5.6% in control animals to 8.8 +/- 5.6% in treated animals (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that tissue plasminogen activator may be efficacious in restoring cerebral blood flow and thus limiting infarct size in acute thromboembolic stroke.\r"

In European and Middle Eastern trials, prehospital delivery of thrombolytic agents by physician-directed mobile intensive care units has been successful. This report describes two independently conceived and performed trials that used cellular telephone transmission of 12-lead ECGs to deliver recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) in the field to patients with AMI. In the Nashville Prehospital TPA Trial, 85 patients with chest pain were evaluated in the field for possible administration of r-tPA over a 6-month period. Three of 85 patients (3.5%) were found to be actual candidates for r-tPA treatment in the field. In phase II (dry-run phase) of the Cincinnati Heart Project, 374 patients were evaluated in the field with 14 documented cases of AMI (3.7%) before r-tPA was placed in ambulances for administration by paramedics. In phase III (active with r-TPA in ambulances), over a 1-year period 103 patients were evaluated with six (5.8%) documented cases of AMI. Three of five r-tPA field treatment decisions by emergency physicians using transmitted 12-lead ECGs were accurate (60%). When patients in phases II and III were combined, only 20 of 477 total patients (4.2%) were documented to have AMI. A decline in paramedic skills was noted because of the infrequent administration of the thrombolytic agent. Combining the Nashville and Cincinnati experiences, only 27 of 562 total patients with chest pain (4.8%) were candidates for prehospital thrombolysis. We conclude that few patients evaluated in the prehospital setting are actual candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Substantial allocation of financial and human resources for prehospital delivery of intravenous thrombolytic therapy does not appear warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin, a peptide that is derived from vascular endothelial cells, is a potent constrictor of mammalian blood vessels in in vitro studies. Various clinical conditions have been reported to be associated with an increase in the blood and tissue levels of endothelin. In the present study, the effects of two doses (2.059 and 4.118 micrograms/kg, intravenously) of endothelin on cardiac function and contractility; blood lactate, gases, and pH levels; blood and cardiac tissue MDA levels; PMN leukocyte chemiluminescence activity; and total WBC and PMN leukocyte counts were investigated in anesthetized dogs. Hemodynamic measurements and collection of blood samples for various biochemical measurements were made before and at various intervals up to 2 hours after endothelin administration. Endothelin in the large dose (4.118 micrograms/kg) produced a prolonged decrease in the indices of cardiac contractility and cardiac function and increases in TSVR, PVR, and mean right atrial pressure. The changes in the hemodynamic parameters with the smaller dose (2.059 micrograms/kg) were similar but of smaller magnitude. Significant decreases in dp/dt at CPIP:PAW and CI and increases in TSVR and PVR were observed with the smaller dose of endothelin. There were decreases in the blood HCO3- and pH levels and an increase in H+ and blood lactate concentration and CK activity with the high dose of endothelin. No changes were observed in blood PO2 and PCO2 with either dose of endothelin. Circulating WBCs and PMN leukocytes decreased significantly with both doses of endothelin. There were no changes in the oxygen free radical-producing activity of PMN leukocytes and in the blood and cardiac tissue MDA levels. These results suggest that endothelin decreased cardiac function and cardiac contractility and increased SVR and PVR. The decrease in cardiac function and contractility may be due to ischemia from constriction of coronary arteries. The hemodynamic changes are unlikely be due to oxygen free radicals since there was no increase in the blood and cardiac tissue MDA levels and no change in the PMN chemiluminescence. These studies suggest that increases in endothelin levels in certain clinical conditions might cause added deleterious effects on cardiovascular function.\r"

The majority of patients could be categorized into four groups: hemolytic disease (18 patients), parenteral nutrition (eight patients), adolescent pregnancy (seven patients), and idiopathic (10 patients), while seven patients had a variety of other etiologies. Right upper quadrant pain was the most common symptom (32 patients), followed by jaundice (15 patients), vomiting (13 patients), and nonspecific abdominal complaints (13 patients). Ten patients presented with jaundice and underlying hemolytic disease; seven patients were asymptomatic. Clinical presentation was found to vary with age and factors associated with the development of gallstones. Ultrasonography was the mode of diagnosis in 48 patients. Cholecystectomy was performed in 36 patients. In contrast to gallstones in adults, after exclusion of the patients with adolescent pregnancy, there was no female predominance. Pancreatitis was the most common complication, occurring in 8% of the patients; cholecystitis and cholangitis were absent.\r"

Enzyme assay of lysates of the lymphocytes and cultured fibroblasts showed little residual activity. The beta G1-specific mRNA levels were normal, as determined by northern blot analysis. Mutated cDNA clones, including the entire coding sequence, were isolated using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products derived from beta G1-deficient fibroblasts. Sequence analysis of the full-length mutated cDNAs showed C----T transitions, which resulted in a single Ala619----Val change (case 1, a 24-year-old male) and a Arg382----Cys change (case 2, a 7-year-old female). The former change was revealed by a loss of the cleavage site for the Fnu4HI in the mutated cDNA. On the basis of the loss of Fnu4HI restriction site, the patient (case 1) was a homozygote with this mutation. The mutational change in patient 2 was confirmed by direct sequencing and by demonstrating heterozygosity for the mutation in her parents. The Ala619----Val and Arg382----Cys mutations each disrupt a different domain which is highly conserved among human, rat, and Escherichia coli beta G1s. Each of these two amino acid changes reduced the beta G1 activity of the corresponding mutant beta G1 expressed following transfection of COS cells with expression vectors harboring the mutated cDNAs.\r"

They report the findings in the 15 patients who had initial plasma triglyceride concentrations above 11.3 mmol/L (1,000 mg/dL). These patients were detected during a prospective study of 155 episodes of ketoacidosis and 56 episodes of ketosis. Eleven of the 15 patients had definite or probable insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), but eight of the 15 were not acidemic despite their ketosis. Twelve of the 15 patients (80%) were men, a far higher percentage of men than the 53.6% in the base population of 211 episodes. Plasma triglyceride concentrations returned to normal levels either during the acute episode (seven cases) or well within a year (two more cases) in most of the patients. From that and other considerations, the authors infer that at least ten, and perhaps 12 of the 15 patients did not have an underlying genetic hyperlipidemia contributing to their original severe hypertriglyceridemia. That contrasts with the findings of others who reported that most patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia associated with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (usually without ketosis) did have coexisting familial hypertriglyceridemia.\r"

The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the direct electrocardiographic and hemodynamic effects of enflurane, isoflurane, and halothane in healthy, unpremedicated patients using an inhalation induction to avoid the confounding effects of other anesthetic agents. Experiments were conducted in 22 adult male patients, (ASA physical status I or II) divided into three groups given either enflurane (n = 6), isoflurane (n = 8), or halothane (n = 8) anesthesia. Twenty-four-hour preoperative, preinduction, and postinduction hemodynamic and electrocardiographic measurements were obtained. Anesthetic blood concentrations, levels of plasma electrolytes, and arterial blood gas tensions were also quantitated. Halothane administration (0.81 +/- 0.06 mM) did not significantly alter the PR interval or QRS duration but significantly increased the QT (0.38 +/- 0.01 to 0.45 +/- 0.01 s) and QTc intervals (0.39 +/- 0.01 to 0.44 +/- 0.02 s). Isoflurane anesthesia (1.04 +/- 0.11 mM) did not significantly change QRS duration or PR and QT intervals but significantly prolonged the QTc interval (0.42 +/- 0.01 to 0.47 +/- 0.14 s). Similarly, enflurane anesthesia (2.16 +/- 0.13 mM) significantly prolonged the QTc (0.40 +/- 0.01 to 0.46 +/- 0.14 s) without change in QRS duration or PR and QT intervals. Plasma electrolyte levels and arterial gas tensions remained within normal limits in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This retrospective study was undertaken to examine the management and outcome of children who developed isolated masseter muscle spasm (MMS) after the administration of intravenous succinylcholine during anesthetic induction. The inhalation anesthetics used for induction were continued in all of these cases. The medical records of 68 patients (male/female ratio, 1.7:1), identified from approximately 42,000 anesthetics given during the period 1980-1989, were reviewed. Fifty-seven children (2.3-12 yr old) were diagnosed as having isolated MMS, i.e., MMS without spasm of other muscles; 11 experienced generalized rigidity in combination with MMS. Anesthetic and postoperative management of these two groups differed. The overall incidence of MMS was 0.3% of inhalation anesthetics during which succinylcholine was given. Intraoperative arrhythmias occurred in 33% of the patients who developed isolated MMS and more frequently in older children. Most children experienced some degree of hypercarbia and/or metabolic acidosis, but the significance of these abnormalities in the spontaneously ventilating, fasting child is unknown. Serum creatine kinase levels when measured 18-24 h postoperatively were elevated in all but one child (n = 45). There was no long-term morbidity and no mortality. We conclude that failure of the masseter muscles to relax after succinylcholine is not uncommon in children. Based on our experience, and accepting that MMS may be part of the clinical spectrum of malignant hyperthermia, we believe that anesthesia can be continued safely in cases of isolated MMS when careful monitoring accompanies diagnostic evaluation. This differs from the current practice of discontinuing the anesthetic or switching to a nontriggering anesthetic technique.\r"

  ".W": "Recent investigations demonstrate that cerebral blood flow (CBF) progressively declines during hypothermic, nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). If CBF declines because of brain cooling, the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) should decline in parallel with the reduction in CBF. Therefore we studied the response of CBF, the cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content difference (A-VDcereO2) and CMRO2 as a function of the duration of CPB in humans. To do this, we compared the cerebrovascular response to changes in the PaCO2. Because sequential CBF measurements using xenon 133 (133Xe) clearance must be separated by 15-25 min, we hypothesized that a time-dependent decline in CBF would accentuate the CBF reduction caused by a decrease in PaCO2, but would blunt the CBF increase associated with a rise in PaCO2. We measured CBF in 25 patients and calculated the cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content difference using radial arterial and jugular venous bulb blood samples. Patients were randomly assigned to management within either a lower (32-48 mm Hg) or higher (50-71 mm Hg) range of PaCO2 uncorrected for temperature. Each patient underwent two randomly ordered sets of measurements, one at a lower PaCO2 and the other at a higher PaCO2 within the respective ranges. Cerebrovascular responsiveness to changes in PaCO2 was calculated as specific reactivity (SR), the change in CBF divided by the change in PaCO2, expressed in mL.100 g-1.min-1.mm Hg-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fentanyl was administered in sequential bolus injections of 2, 4, 16, 64, and 128 micrograms/kg, with 10 min between each dose. Arterial plasma fentanyl concentrations and blood gas tensions were measured 3 and 9 min after each dose and 1, 2, 5, 20, 60, and 120 min after the final dose. At the same time periods, mean systemic arterial, pulmonary arterial, central venous, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, cardiac output, heart rate, and respiratory rate were measured. Analgesia was quantified as the time required for tail withdrawal from a standardized noxious stimulus. Tail latency response time increased significantly after the 4-microgram/kg dose (plasma fentanyl concentration = 2.7 +/- 0.9 ng/mL). Maximum tail latency response time was attained after the 64-micrograms/kg dose (43.4 +/- 26.0 ng/mL). Respiratory rate decreased significantly after the 2-microgram/kg dose, and PaCO2 increased significantly after the 4-microgram/kg dose. All animals became apneic, requiring tracheal intubation and controlled ventilation, after the 64-micrograms/kg dose. Also, mean arterial pressure and cardiac output decreased significantly after the 64-micrograms/kg dose. There were no other significant cardiovascular changes. Peak plasma fentanyl concentration after the 128-micrograms/kg dose was 117.0 +/- 49.6 ng/mL. It appears that plasma concentrations of approximately 40 ng/mL are sufficient to reach the full cardiovascular, respiratory, and analgesic effects of fentanyl in the rhesus monkey. Significant respiratory and analgesic effects are evident at concentrations as low as 3 ng/mL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Regional blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres and used to compute regional oxygen (O2) supply. Values for regional blood flow in myocardium were used to compute myocardial O2 (MVO2) and lactate uptake (MVLAC) using the Fick equation. Hemodilution to hematocrit 50% of baseline increased aortic blood flow and decreased systemic vascular resistance, although other systemic hemodynamic values were not changed. Twofold increases in myocardial blood flow were accompanied by no change in MVO2, MVLAC, or coronary sinus PO2. Hemodilution increased regional blood flow sufficiently in the pancreas, liver, duodenum, skeletal muscle, skin, and brain to preserve O2 supply whereas unchanged blood flow in the spleen and kidney reduced O2 supply. Under hemodilution, 15 min of intravenous SNP sufficient to reduce mean arterial pressure by 50% caused parallel reductions in aortic blood flow, dP/dt max, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure; systemic vascular resistance was unaffected. Myocardial blood flow and MVO2 decreased proportionally, whereas MVLAC and coronary sinus PO2 did not change. Regional blood flow and O2 supply decreased in the kidney, spleen, liver, and skin. Extending SNP infusion to 60 min increased myocardial blood flow and MVO2, but other hemodynamic values were unchanged. Comparing previous results with adenosine-induced hypotension inferred that coronary vasodilator reserve was greatly reduced at this time. In conclusion, although myocardial O2 supply versus demand balance was well maintained during SNP-induced hypotension under hemodiluted conditions, diminished coronary vasodilator reserve suggests increased vulnerability to ischemia if stresses of augmented cardiac work demand or impaired arterial oxygenation were superimposed. The decrease in O2 supply in the kidney during combined hemodilution and SNP-induced hypotension also warrants concern. These latter findings suggest the need for extensive clinical monitoring when SNP is used for controlled hypotension under hemodiluted conditions.\r"

The devastating nature of neurofibromatosis-2 may be more effectively controlled through the application of advanced imaging techniques and contemporary neurotologic procedures. The most common manifestation of neurofibromatosis-2 is that of bilateral acoustic neuromas. The eventual total bilateral sensorineural deafness associated with this condition can be obviated in selected cases if the diagnosis is established early. Follow-up data are reported for three patients in whom hearing was preserved in at least one ear. When removal with hearing preservation is not possible, subtotal tumor removal with decompression of the internal auditory canals may delay progression of hearing loss. A new approach to tumors of the pterygomaxillary fossa that have extended to the middle cranial fossa has been successfully applied and is described.\r"

Carbogen led to little or no change in CBF as monitored with either measurement approach in either subject group. Electrical stimulation yielded an increase (15% to 25%) in CBF as recorded from the promontory in seven of the nine subjects tested. Warm (44 degrees C to 49 degrees C) water irrigation produced changes of 20% to 60% in CBF that were partially recoverable in the 10 minutes available for study. This study demonstrated the feasibility of direct CBF measurement in humans with the L-D method. Moreover, the data indicate that carbogen has little influence on CBF and that electrical stimulation at relatively safe levels and warm water irrigation of the ear canal produce increases in human CBF.\r"

Under these circumstances it is not known what changes occur in the fixed component of hepatic protein synthesis. The aim of this study was to compare circulating interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) concentrations and fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates in a group of healthy controls (n = 6) with a group of patients with an established APP response secondary to hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer (n = 6). Fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates were measured following a primed, constant 20-hour infusion of 15N-glycine. The liver was biopsied at laparotomy. The APP response was assessed by serum C-reactive protein concentration and cytokines were assayed by a combination of immunoassay and bioassay. The patients with advanced cancer and an on-going APP response had elevated circulating IL-6 concentrations (p less than 0.01). Rates of fixed hepatic protein synthesis were 30% lower than those observed in controls (p less than 0.01). These findings demonstrate that in patients with hepatic metastasis, although the synthesis of certain acute-phase export proteins can be increased, fixed protein synthesis is reduced. Whether these changes in the distribution of hepatic protein synthesis are mediated by IL-6 will require further investigation.\r"

Fresh porcine valves treated with either acetone, 4% formaldehyde, or 0.625% glutaraldehyde, as well as an unfixed valve, were incubated with antiserum against porcine xenoantigens. This serum was prepared using the affinity purification method with porcine lymphocytes as the target. The valves were stained with secondary fluorescein-conjugated antibody against immunoglobulin M or immunoglobulin G and examined under fluorescent microscopy. Intense binding of immunoglobulin M to the endocardium was observed in the unfixed valve as well as in valves fixed in acetone and formaldehyde. Glutaraldehyde fixation eliminated binding of antibody. Binding was not noted within the connective tissue. No binding of antiimmunoglobulin G was noted on the endocardium of any of the sections. Examination of three glutaraldehyde-treated porcine valves explanted from the aortic position after 10 years in situ showed no immunoglobulin deposition. These results demonstrate the elimination of antigenicity to preformed antibodies in the endocardium and connective tissue of glutaraldehyde-preserved porcine valves. The findings may, in part, explain the poor performance of formaldehyde-preserved bioprosthetic xenograft valves in the past and support the use of glutaraldehyde as a preferred agent for preservation of bioprosthetic endovascular materials.\r"

Forty-eight rat hearts were perfused on a modified Langendorff preparation. After a baseline record of increase in coronary flow induced by 10(-7) M 5-HT and 10 micrograms/mL nitroglycerin, the hearts were perfused for 30 or 60 minutes with either St. Thomas' solution or Bretschneider solution containing 20 mmol/L of potassium or for 30 minutes with either solution containing 30 mmol/L of potassium (n = 8 in each). Initially, 5-HT and nitroglycerin caused a 39.0% +/- 3.3% and 39.7% +/- 2.8% increase in coronary flow, respectively. After 30 or 60 minutes' perfusion with St. Thomas' solution containing 20 mmol/L of potassium, there was little change in the response to 5-HT or nitroglycerin (5-HT, 43.1% +/- 4.1%; nitroglycerin, 38% +/- 3.2%). Similarly, perfusion with Bretschneider solution (20 mmol/L K+) for 30 or 60 minutes did not alter the degree of vasodilation (5-HT, 39.2% +/- 2.9%; nitroglycerin, 38.0% +/- 3.3%). However, perfusion with St. Thomas' solution containing 30 mmol/L of potassium for 30 minutes abolished the endothelial-dependent 5-HT-induced vasodilation (5-HT, -1.6% +/- 1.4%; nitroglycerin, 36.9% +/- 2.2%). Perfusion with Bretschneider solution (30 mmol/L K+) gave similar results (5-HT, -2.1% +/- 1.2%; nitroglycerin, 36.4% +/- 1.7%).

After 24 weeks, mean reductions from baseline values of plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were, respectively, 23% and 30% with pravastatin and 14% and 17% with gemfibrozil. Significant lipid-lowering effects were noted within 4 weeks. Apolipoprotein B decrease was 21% with pravastatin and 13% with gemfibrozil. A statistically significant increase of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 5% was achieved with pravastatin compared with a 13% increase for gemfibrozil. Serum triglyceride values decreased 5% with pravastatin and 37% with gemfibrozil. Familial and polygenic hypercholesterolemic patients were also examined separately. Pravastatin effectiveness in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was greater by 6% in polygenic than in familial hypercholesterolemic patients. Treatment for 25 patients (eight treated with pravastatin and 17 treated with gemfibrozil) was discontinued during the study. The incidence of clinical symptoms and laboratory alterations was low for both treatment groups. Pravastatin and gemfibrozil were well tolerated, but pravastatin was significantly more effective in reducing total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in primary (either familial or polygenic) hypercholesterolemias than gemfibrozil.\r"

Interferon-gamma has been shown to improve the immune response following experimental shock and injury; however, its effect on myelopoiesis is controversial. This study was performed to determine whether treatment with interferon-gamma will improve the bone marrow response to lipopolysaccharide after hemorrhagic shock. Rats subjected to either shock or a sham procedure were allocated into three groups: (1) control rats received no further treatment; (2) lipopolysaccharide-treated rats received saline for 3 days and then were challenged with lipopolysaccharide to stimulate myelopoiesis; and (3) interferon-treated rats received interferon-gamma (7500 U subcutaneously 1 hour after shock and then every day for 3 days) and lipopolysaccharide as in group 2. Serum colony-stimulating factor levels were measured 6 hours and bone marrow white blood cell count and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) were measured 24 hours following lipopolysaccharide administration. In sham-treated rats, lipopolysaccharide increased CFU-GM 77% compared with controls. In contrast, treatment with lipopolysaccharide decreased CFU-GM 43% following shock. Treatment with interferon-gamma increased CFU-GM in all animals and reversed the decline in CFU-GM seen in shocked lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. Serum colony-stimulating factor levels were unaffected by either shock or interferon-gamma administration. These data demonstrate that interferon-gamma exerts a stimulatory effect on bone marrow following shock and restores the myelopoietic response to lipopolysaccharide.\r"

Levels of resting energy expenditure and cardiac index were comparably elevated in all patients, but leg blood flow was greater in the patients receiving growth hormone. Growth hormone therapy (0.2 mg/kg per day) significantly stimulated protein synthesis in the whole body and in the studied leg. A hyperinsulinemic clamp, which raised the insulin concentration to more than 1435 pmol/L of blood, caused comparable stimulation of leg protein synthesis in patients not receiving growth hormone, but did not further increase protein synthesis in the growth hormone-treated patients. These results suggest that administration of exogenous growth hormone may limit the peripheral protein wasting in severely injured patients by a mechanism similar to that of insulin.\r"

Although rates of bacterial translocation were similar, corticosterone levels were significantly different among the three groups and correlated with the number of lymphocytes and the number of enteric bacteria present per gram of MLN. Thus, pathophysiologic elevations of corticosterone levels during sepsis may exert an effect that allows survival of translocated bacteria in the MLNs of rats, perhaps due to glucocorticoid-associated alterations in regional immunity.\r"

Splenic and bone marrow macrophages were isolated and cultured in either M199 medium alone or were stimulated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The supernatants were tested for prostaglandin E2 and C3. The splenic prostaglandin E2 levels were significantly higher in the TPN group following lipopolysaccharide stimulation at 7 days but not at 14 days. Administration of TPN to rats, even without lipids, may be immunosuppressive through the release of prostaglandin E2 from splenic macrophages following a septic challenge. This effect appears to be abolished after 14 days of TPN infusion.\r"

In this investigation the effects of different doses of E on coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), left ventricular myocardial blood flow (MBF) and resuscitation success were compared during closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after a 4-minute period of ventricular fibrillation in 28 pigs. MBF was measured during normal sinus rhythm using tracer microspheres. After 4 minutes of ventricular fibrillation CPR was performed with the use of a pneumatic piston compressor. After 4 minutes of mechanical measures only, the animals were randomly allocated into four groups of seven, receiving 0.015, 0.030, 0.045, and 0.090 mg/kg E intravenously respectively. MBF measurements were started 45 seconds after E administration; hemodynamic measurements after 90 seconds. Four minutes after the first administration, the same E dose was given before defibrillation. The CPP of animals given 0.015, 0.030, 0.045 and 0.090 mg/kg E were as follows: 16.3 +/- 6.1, 25.6 +/- 5.8, 33.2 +/- 8.4 and 30.4 +/- 6.3 mm Hg. The left ventricular MBF values were: 14 +/- 9, 27 +/- 11, 43 +/- 6, 46 +/- 10 mL/min/100 g. The differences between the groups receiving 0.015 and 0.045 mg/kg and between the groups receiving 0.015 mg/kg and 0.090 mg/kg were statistically significant (P less than .05). Resuscitation success was 14.3%, 42.9%, 100% and 86.7% respectively. A significant difference in resuscitation success was found only between 0.015 mg/kg and 0.045 mg/kg E.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The characteristics of the patients are discussed including initial diagnostic approaches and the use of computed tomography (CT) scanning of the neck and mediastinum. One case of retropharyngeal space infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis serotype W-135 is described. This is the first such reported case. The recommendations are that, in the absence of overt focal infection, a non-surgical approach to the treatment of these patients is indicated. This should include suitable neck roentgenograms, CT scanning, and high-dose, intravenous, beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics.\r"

Smoke produced during laser resection of tracheobronchial malignancies may increase concentrations of COHb. We have measured COHb concentrations in 14 patients undergoing laser resection and compared SpO2 with functional oxygen saturation (SaO2) to ascertain if pulse oximetry is an accurate monitor of oxygen saturation. During the procedure frequent changes occur in ventilatory mechanics. Arterial blood-gas tensions were measured to see if gas exchange was satisfactory. Mean preoperative COHb was 1.4%. There was no significant change in COHb in any patient at any stage during treatment. The highest value was 2.05%. The mean difference between SaO2 and SpO2 was 1.13% (95% confidence interval 0.70-1.56%). Oxygen saturation may therefore safely be monitored by pulse oximetry in patients managed by our technique. Empirical setting of a jet ventilator provided acceptable blood-gas tensions, although sometimes it was necessary to increase the FlO2 to greater than 0.3 to maintain oxygenation.\r"

The staining patterns in follicles from non-lesional scalp were normal. Miniature anagen follicles from bald patches also showed relatively normal expression of basement membrane proteins and proteoglycans. However, in some large anagen follicles from lesional sites, there was loss of the normal staining pattern for chondroitin-6-sulphate in the dermal papilla. In lesional catagen follicles, the glassy membranes showed marked convolution and thickening. These structures stained strongly for laminin and type IV collagen but only weakly for interstitial collagens.\r"

  ".W": "Phagocytes from X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD) patients are deficient in their ability to generate superoxide because of a defective gene that encodes a heavy chain of cytochrome b, a critical component in the superoxide-generating pathway. Previously we have shown that a single in vivo treatment of selected X-CGD patients with interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) resulted 14 days later in near-normal levels of superoxide generation by phagocytes. The effect persisted for 28 days. This prolonged effect suggested that the lymphokine affected progenitor cells. In this study, we examined progenitor-derived colonies from the peripheral blood from this unusual X-CGD kindred. Progenitor-derived colonies examined before treatment were unable to generate superoxide as visualized by lack of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction compared with normal controls. By contrast, colonies derived 7 days after a single INF-gamma injection were able to generate superoxide as shown by increased NBT reduction. Colonies harvested 21 days after treatment contained only rare cells capable of NBT reduction. Our results indicate that INF-gamma can reprogram the myeloid progenitor cells to express a partially corrected phenotype. This corrected phenotype is later expressed in daughter cells.\r"

Quantitative analyses of the correlated expression of CD40 and other B-lineage differentiation antigens on fetal lymphoid precursor cells by multiparameter two-color/three-color flow cytometry, combined with analyses of sequential antigen expression on fluorescence-activated cell fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) isolated immunologically distinct fetal B-cell precursor subpopulations during in vitro proliferation and differentiation, provided evidence that the acquisition of CD40 antigen in human B-cell ontogeny occurs subsequent to the expression of CD10 and CD19 antigens but before the surface expression of CD20, CD21, CD22, CD24, and surface immunoglobulin M (sIgM). Some leukemic pro-B cells from ALL patients as well as normal pro-B cell clones from fetal livers displaying germline Ig heavy chain genes were CD40+, indicating that the acquisition of CD40 antigen likely precedes the rearrangement of Ig heavy chain genes. CD40+ FACS-sorted malignant cells from B-lineage ALL as well as B-lineage NHL patients were capable of in vitro clonogenic growth, indicating the CD40 antigen is expressed on clonogenic leukemia and lymphoma cells. This hypothesis was confirmed by the ability of an anti-CD40 immunotoxin that we used as an antigen-specific cytotoxic probe to effectively kill clonogenic B-lineage ALL and NHL cells.\r"

  ".W": "Infection is a common problem for bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients during the period of neutropenia that immediately follows the procedure. Gram-negative infections present a particular hazard in these immunocompromised hosts. To augment host defenses against one such pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we immunized bone marrow transplant donors and/or recipients with a polyvalent O-polysaccharide-toxin A conjugate vaccine. When either donor or recipient alone was vaccinated before transplant, no increase in specific antibody titers to any of the vaccine components was observed in the recipient. However, when both donor and recipient were vaccinated before transplant, increases in antibody titers to all polysaccharide components occurred to levels shown to be protective in animal models of gram-negative sepsis. Specific antibodies were primarily of the IgG1 and IgG2 subclass even though IgG2 subclass deficiency is common after BMT. The requirement for both donor and recipient immunization reflects the need for primed donor B lymphocytes in the marrow inoculum to be transferred into an antigen-containing environment so that maximum B-cell proliferation and antibody secretion can occur. Adoptive transfer of antibody responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other common bacterial pathogens has the potential to reduce infection-related morbidity and mortality after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Endotoxemia was evoked by bolus injection of Escherichia coli endotoxin (2 ng/kg body weight) in six healthy subjects to investigate the early kinetics of cytokine release in relation to the development of clinical and hematologic abnormalities frequently seen in gram-negative septicemia. The plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) increased markedly after 30 to 45 minutes, and reached a maximal level after 60 to 90 minutes. In each volunteer, the initial increase of plasma interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentrations occurred 15 minutes after the initial TNF increase, and maximal IL-6 concentrations were reached at 120 to 150 minutes. A transient increase in body temperature and pulse rate occurred simultaneously with the initial TNF and IL-6 increases, whereas a significant decrease in blood pressure occurred after 120 minutes. These changes were proportional to the changes in TNF and IL-6 concentrations. Coagulation activation, as assessed by a rise of prothrombin fragments and thrombin-antithrombin III complexes, was noted after 120 minutes, in the absence of activation of the contact system. A two- to sixfold increase in the concentrations of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and von Willebrand factor antigen indicated endothelial cell activation. This increase started at 120 and 90 minutes, respectively. The release of t-PA coincided with activation of the fibrinolytic pathway, as measured by plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complexes. The fibrinolytic activity of t-PA was subsequently offset by release of plasminogen activator inhibitor, observed 150 minutes after the endotoxin injection, and reaching a peak at 240 minutes. No complement activation was detected. These results show that in humans endotoxin induces an early, rapidly counteracted fibrinolytic response, and a more long-lasting activation of thrombin by a mechanism other than contact system activation. In addition, our data suggest that endotoxin-induced leukopenia and endothelial cell activation are mediated by TNF.\r"

Herein, we describe the activity of recombinant DNA-derived Bat-PA (rBat-PA) in a human plasma milieu. rBat-PA and recombinant human single-chain tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) are similarly efficacious at lysing plasma clots. In stark contrast to rt-PA, the addition of 250 nmol/L rBat-PA to plasma in the absence of a clot failed to deplete plasminogen, alpha 2-antiplasmin and fibrinogen. The lytic activities exhibited by finger-domain minus Bat-PA (F- rBat-PA) and finger and epidermal growth factor-like domains minus Bat-PA (FG- rBat-PA) were less than rBat-PA, especially at low concentrations of PA; nevertheless, these truncated forms also possessed a strict requirement for a fibrin cofactor. The loss of PA activity following the addition of rBat-PA to plasma was slower than that observed when either rt-PA or two-chain rt-PA was added. The efficacy, fibrin selectivity, and decreased susceptibility to inactivation exhibited by rBat-PA in vitro in a human plasma milieu suggests that rBat-PA may be superior to rt-PA for the treatment of thrombotic complications.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the in vitro hematopoietic stimulatory activity of leukemia inhibitory factor/human interleukin for DA cells (LIF/HILDA) on bone marrow progenitor populations in 17 normal individuals. In serum-free cultures LIF/HILDA did not induce colony growth. In serum containing media, LIF/HILDA stimulated the growth of colony forming unit (CFU)-MIX and CFU-EO in a dose-dependent fashion and resulted in an increased CFU-MIX and burst forming unit-erythrocytes (BFU-E) colony size. Similar stimulatory effects were seen on a highly purified hematopoietic progenitor population obtained after immunomagnetic depletion of mature myeloid precursors and lymphoid cells. Addition of LIF/HILDA to cultures containing maximally stimulatory concentrations of recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhuIL3), rhuIL3 + rhuIL6, or rhu granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhu GM-CSF) in serum containing media significantly increased the number of CFU-MIX and eosinophil colonies and increased size and cluster number of CFU-MIX and BFU-E. Depletion of accessory T lymphocytes or monocytes from bone marrow progenitors did not alter the response of hematopoietic precursors to LIF/HILDA. A similar increased colony growth was seen when LIF/HILDA was added to cultures of positively selected CD34/HLA-DR+ or CD34+/HLA-DR- bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells stimulated with maximally stimulatory concentrations of rhuIL3 + rhuIL6. LIF/HILDA is a novel cytokine capable of stimulating growth and proliferation of multi-lineage, erythroid, and eosinophil colonies in the presence of serum. LIF/HILDA exerts its activity by direct interaction with highly purified immature bone marrow progenitor cells, has an additive effect when used with other cytokines known to stimulate primitive hematopoietic precursors, and does not require accessory cells.\r"

  ".W": "T-cell receptor (TCR) delta gene rearrangements are observed in more than 80% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Moreover, a preferential usage of specific genetic elements has been shown in different ALL subtypes: V delta 1 DJ delta 1 rearrangements predominate in T-ALL, while most B-precursor ALLs show a recombination of V delta 2 to D delta 3. Recently we have proposed a strategy for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) based on the isolation of clonospecific probes following the in vitro amplification of V delta 1 DJ delta 1 junctions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and now have adapted this method to the preparation of specific V delta 2 D delta 3 fragments. In the present study, clonospecific probes were generated from 11 T-ALL and 16 cALL patients (21 children, 6 adults). The sensitivity of these 27 probes in detecting residual leukemia cells varied between 10(-4) to 10(-6) as determined by semiquantitative evaluation of dilution experiments. PCR analysis of 55 bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples obtained from the 27 patients during complete clinical remission showed the following results: (1) Evidence for MRD was obtained in the BM of all patients (eight of eight) investigated 2 to 6 months after remission induction and also in 6 of 11 cases on maintenance therapy 7 to 19 months after diagnosis. (2) In contrast, all patients but one (10 of 11) analyzed 6 to 41 months after the termination of treatment lacked apparent evidence for leukemia DNA; the exception was a girl exhibiting 10(-4) to 10(-5) residual cells in her PB 5.5 years after diagnosis. (3) Longitudinal analysis in nine patients disclosed marked individual differences in the intervals between achievement of clinical remission and complete eradication of the leukemia cell clone. (4) Differences in the duration of MRD were not associated with distinct clinical-hematologic features. (5) Detection of residual disease by PCR proceeded clinical relapse in two cases.\r"

In the 1-dose short-term experiments, rats treated with doxorubicin and mitomycin C had a high incidence of chemical reactions, including congestion of the mucosa with methylene blue stain, increased bladder weight with oedematous changes either in the mucosa (doxorubian) or the muscle layer (mitomycin C), and infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells 3 days after instillation. These local changes disappeared within 10 days. In long-term experiments with weekly instillations of chemotherapeutic drugs, the rats showed no significant change in weight, methylene blue staining or mucosal congestion. A high percentage of pyuria and microscopic haematuria with submucosal/muscular fibrosis was noted in rats receiving doxorubicin or mitomycin C. A severe dysplastic change in the urothelium was noted in rats treated with mitomycin C. These results suggest that careful follow-up is required in patients receiving intravesical doxorubicin or mitomycin C because of possible severe side effects in the bladder.\r"

  ".W": "Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an enzyme located almost exclusively in villus tip enterocytes. Its plasma activity is enhanced by intravenous heparin which releases the enzymes from small bowel enterocytes into the blood. Plasma postheparin DAO (PHD) values have been shown to be significantly lower in patients with malabsorption and villous atrophy, thus suggesting that PHD reflects the mature enterocytic mass. In this study we have assayed PHD in five patients with small bowel lymphoma (two with immunoproliferative small intestinal disease [IPSID] and three with non-IPSID lymphoma) associated with malabsorption syndrome and small bowel mucosa atrophy. The PHD test was performed at diagnosis, after partial or complete remission induced by chemotherapy, and during the follow-up. The PHD values, very low at diagnosis (0.66 +/- 0.12 U/ml), increased during chemotherapy and reached the normal range (greater than 3.7 U/ml) when complete remission occurred. The PHD values rapidly and consistently decreased whenever the disease relapsed. Our data indicate that in patients with small bowel lymphoma PHD test is a sensitive marker of small bowel mucosa damage and suggest that it could be useful in monitoring the recovery of mucosal lesions induced by chemotherapy.\r"

A complete and maintained suppression of both T and LH levels was seen. FSH levels also decreased, but to a lesser extent than LH levels, and showed a small escape after reaching a minimum value after 1 month of therapy. The LHRH challenge after 42 months of therapy elicited no significant responses of LH and FSH levels. The PRL values showed a small decrease.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 478 patients with T1-3N0 glottic carcinoma treated by irradiation is presented. Of these patients, 320 were previously untreated, whereas 158 patients were referred for treatment of a recurrence after receiving radiotherapy elsewhere. The primary recurrence rate in the previously untreated patients was 10%. The rate was higher in T2 and T3 tumors, poorly differentiated tumors, and in patients who were in poor general condition. Over 80% of the recurrent tumors were Stage pT3 or pT4, whereas 12% of total laryngectomy specimens showed necrosis only with no evidence of tumor. The necrosis rate in previously untreated patients was 1% for T1 tumors, 4% for T2 tumors, and 3% for T3 tumors. Of all tumors, 60% were transglottic when they recurred, whereas only 29% were confined to the glottis at recurrence. Histologic diagnosis had a high sensitivity but a low specificity, indicating that a negative histologic report is unreliable. Of patients with a recurrent primary tumor, 13% were untreatable. The 5-year survival after a primary recurrence was 39%, and the main prognostic factors were sex, T stage at recurrence, and time to recurrence. Of patients available for follow-up at 5 years 49% were alive with a larynx, 5% were alive without a larynx, 13% were dead of the original cancer, and 33% had died of other causes. In those suffering a primary recurrence, the commonest cause of death was a subsequent lymph node metastasis, followed in order of frequency by stomal recurrence and recurrence in the pharyngeal remnant. The hospital mortality rate after laryngectomy was 3%, and 30% of patients undergoing laryngectomy developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. The recurrence rate in lymph nodes was 14% at 5 years, general condition and T stage being the only significant predictors of recurrence. Only 17% of patients had small (N1) nodes by the time the diagnosis of cervical lymph node recurrence was made, and 27% of all patients were unsuitable for treatment. Host, tumor factors, and time to recurrence were not significant predictors of survival after node recurrence. The survival rate 5 years after node recurrence was 16%, and the main cause of death in those who died was uncontrolled disease in the neck. The hospital mortality after salvage neck dissection was 4.7%.\r"

Tumor cells were inoculated subcutaneously (SC) over the calvaria in mice, resulting in a local tumor causing fragmentation of the bone. The tumor-induced osteolysis associated with osteoclasts proliferation was accompanied with reactive new bone formation. This osteolysis was evaluated by measuring the increased area of bone resorption in reduced opacity to radiograph and histologic study. The results showed the following sequence of potency: AHBuBP greater than AHPrBP = HEBP. This inhibition was obtained with no apparent effect on the growth of the MBT-2 tumor. The authors conclude that AHBuBP appears to be an interesting new bisphosphonate with possible clinical application.\r"

None of the patients showed Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Two variants of carcinoids showing distinctive pathologic and pathogenetic characteristics were identified on the basis of presence or absence of associated chronic atrophic gastritis type A (A-CAG). Chronic atrophic gastritis type A was found in 19 cases showing either single or multiple neoplasms, tumor extension limited to the mucosa or submucosa, consistent endocrine cell precursor changes in extratumoral mucosa, and consistent hypergastrinemia and/or G cell hyperplasia. Associated precursor lesions were only hyperplastic in all but two cases with single carcinoids whereas they were also dysplastic in all but one case with multiple carcinoids. The four tumors arising in nonatrophic mucosa were all single, more aggressive, and not associated with extratumoral endocrine cell proliferations or with signs of gastrin hypersecretion. Tumor cells were diffusely immunoreactive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin but usually negative for chromogranin B or HISL-19. Scattered serotonin cells were found in ten carcinoids. They were more frequent in infiltrating than in intramucosal tumors as were the less represented pancreatic polypeptide cells whereas the reverse was found for alpha-subunit-containing cells. These results are of relevance for tumor pathogenesis and may provide the rationale for a less aggressive therapeutic approach in the patients.\r"

Hence the finding of six individuals with both these conditions in a small population with testicular cancer is highly conspicuous and indicates some kind of connection among such persons. Despite the identical clinical appearances of their ichthyoses, three of the ichthyotic subjects had no measurable activity of the enzyme, steroid sulfatase (STS) in leucocytes, a distinct characteristic of recessive X-linked ichthyosis (RXLI). However, the remaining three subjects had normal STS activity, a strong indicator of autosomal dominant ichthyosis (ADI). The STS activity in patients with testicular cancer who do not have ichthyosis (N = 30) was also within the normal range. The patients with testicular cancer with no skin disease had elevated serum levels of 4-androstenedione (4-AD), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) but had reduced levels of estrone and estrone sulfate. The other serum parameters measured did not significantly differ from normal levels. In essence, the hormone levels obtained for the patients with ichthyotic testicular cancer followed the same pattern, although their dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and estrone sulfate levels tended to be slightly higher than normal. However, no conspicuous aberrations in any of the parameters examined were observed, and why men with ichthyosis are at high risk for testicular cancer remains an unresolved issue.\r"

In mice, the activity increased with age from birth to 24 days, but were always higher in audiogenic mice than in normal C57/BL mice, reflecting species differences. The difference between the two strains increased sharply from 25 to 40 days of age, after the period of maximal audiogenic susceptibility. Acetazolamide, a CA-specific inhibitor, greatly decreased the seizure severity score of DBA/2 mice after a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration (150 mg/kg). After 24 days of age, when CA activities were high, the effect of acetazolamide was less important, suggesting that the increased cortical CA activity might reflect a protective mechanism. In cats with a freeze lesion, no significant changes in CA activities were observed in the actively discharging primary and secondary foci as compared with the nonepileptogenic perifocal cortex and the control cortex of sham-operated animals. The results indicate that the cortex of genetically susceptible audiogenic mice has an increased CA activity. The hypothesis of an adaptive glial mechanism, relating to the age-dependent decrease of seizure susceptibility in DBA/2 mice, is postulated.\r"

Higher doses were necessary to abolish clonic convulsion and running response. Because impaired cerebral (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity is supposed to play a role in epileptogenesis, we tested MLM on in vitro cortical enzymatic activity of DBA/2J mice. Basal (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity was unchanged by several concentrations of MLM in normal C57BL/6J and audiogenic DBA/2J mice. K+ activation (from 3 to 18 mM) of (Na+, K+)-ATPase is abolished in DBA/2J mice as compared with C57BL/6J mice, suggesting impaired glial (Na+, K+)-ATPase. In the presence of MLM (from 30 to 1000 mg/L), cortical (Na+, K+)-ATPase of DBA/2J mice is activated by high concentrations of K+, as in C57BL/6J mice. Results suggest that the antiepileptic activity of MLM in audiogenic mice may be secondary to an activation of a deficient glial (Na+, K+)-ATPase.\r"

Intravenous (i.v.) administration of 2 mg/kg had no effect on either photosensitivity or cortically kindled seizures. When this agent was administered intracisternally, both the photomyoclonic response and cortically kindled seizures were suppressed for 4-5 days. A study of the transcallosal response also showed a long-lasting attenuation of the early positive wave (P1) amplitude (peak latency, 5-10 ms) elicited by a single stimulus after cisternal injection of DN-1417. These findings are consistent with the assumption that endogenous TRH is involved in suppression of epileptic seizures.\r"

An association of these syndromes with a benign course had been disputed. In this study, a retrospective investigation of reactive occipital epileptiform activity (ROEA) was performed to determine the prognostic value of this distinctive EGG pattern. The EEG and hospital record of patients with ROEA were reviewed with an observation period of 6 months to 8 years. The patients were divided into good and poor outcome groups based on response to treatment. Of 33 patients, 12 (36.4%) had complete seizure control; 21 (63.6%) continued to have poorly controlled seizures. Only 3 (9.1%) patients were able to discontinue antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) without seizure recurrence. Analysis of clinical and EEG variables showed that a history of perinatal difficulties, abnormal neurologic findings, and abnormal EEG background activities occur significantly more frequently in the poor outcome group. This study suggests that ROEA is not uniformly associated with a benign course and that other factors are involved in determining prognosis of the epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified a group of women with infertility and regular menses who have persistently raised FSH levels and probable incipient ovarian failure (IOF). Thirteen such women (19 cycles) had serum samples taken for RIA of LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone (P) 3 times a week over 1 menstrual cycle. Sixty infertile women with normal ovulatory cycles (as determined by hormones and ultrasound scan) served as controls. Overall, the FSH was higher (P less than 0.01) on all days of the cycle in the IOF group, serum LH was raised on days-14 to-5 before and days 5-11 after the LH surge. There was no difference between estradiol and P levels in the two groups. Ultrasound scanning showed failure of normal ovulation in the IOF group. Inhibin, measured by RIA in 9 cycles in the IOF group was lower (P less than 0.01) during the follicular phase than in 43 normal cycles. The highest inhibin level was seen in the luteal phase, as in normal cycles, but levels were still lower (P less than 0.01) in the IOF group. Inhibin was inversely correlated with FSH (P less than 0.05) during the follicular and luteal phases and was correlated with P during the luteal phase (P less than 0.05) in the IOF group. After 3 weeks of suppression (39 cycles) with an estrogen-progestogen preparation in the IOF group, LH and FSH fell to normal values. Ovulation occurred in 22 cycles on withdrawal of suppression in the presence of high FSH levels and low inhibin levels. No pregnancies occurred. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that diminished ovarian inhibin secretion may contribute to the elevated FSH levels of IOF and indicate that ovulation in the rebound cycle after suppression occurs in the presence of high FSH and low inhibin levels. Such cycles, however, still appear to be subfertile.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1980 and 1989, five infants (four males and one female) with congenital hypopituitarism were born within a relatively sparsely populated area of central Massachusetts, an incidence 25-fold greater than expected. In all infants the pituitary stalk was undetectable on magnetic resonance imaging, and a bright spot on T-1 weighted imaging, probably representing posterior pituitary tissue, was found ectopically located inferior to the median eminence. The height of the anterior pituitary remnant on magnetic resonance imaging varied from undetectable to 4 mm, and similarly, on hormonal testing a spectrum of deficiencies of GH, TSH, ACTH, and gonadotropin was observed. The magnitude of the hypopituitarism was less in the three patients whose anterior pituitary remnant was greater than 2 mm, and in them, TRH testing resulted in exaggerated TSH and PRL responses, suggestive of hypothalamic disease. In contrast, in the other two patients in whom the anterior pituitary remnant was less than 2 mm in height, hypopituitarism was more severe, and TRH administration resulted in little if any TSH or PRL response, characteristic of pituitary disease. The size of the anterior pituitary remnant correlated significantly with that of the ectopic posterior pituitary bright spot (P less than 0.005). We conclude that patients with congenital hypopituitarism may exhibit a spectrum of hormonal responses, varying from findings typical of hypothalamic to those characteristic of primary pituitary disease. The pattern of hormonal responsiveness is dependent on the quantity of residual anterior pituitary tissue and probably results from abnormal transport of the hypothalamic hypophyseal releasing hormones rather than to any putative hypothalamic abnormality. The significant correlation between the size and function of the anterior pituitary gland and the size of the ectopic posterior pituitary remnant suggests that the fetal pituitary gland may secrete a factor necessary for the growth and descent of the neuroepithelium to form the infundibulum and posterior pituitary gland.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the mechanism underlying pulsatile TSH secretion, 24-h serum TSH levels were measured in three groups of five healthy volunteers by sampling blood every 10 min. The influence of an 8-h infusion of dopamine (200 mg), somatostatin (500 micrograms), or nifedipine (5 mg) on the pulsatile release of TSH was tested using a cross-over design. The amount of TSH released per pulse was significantly lowered by these drugs, resulting in significantly decreased mean basal TSH serum levels. However, pulses of TSH were still detectable at all times. The TSH response to TRH (200 micrograms) tested in separate experiments was significantly lowered after 3 h of nifedipine infusion compared to the saline control value. Nifedipine treatment did not alter basal, pulsatile, or TRH-stimulated PRL secretion. The persistence of TSH pulses under dopamine and somatostatin treatment and the blunted TSH responses to nifedipine infusion support the hypothesis that pulsatile TSH secretion is under the control of hypothalamic TRH. The 24-h TSH secretion pattern achieved under stimulation with exogenous TRH in two patients with hypothalamic destruction through surgical removal of a craniopharyngioma provided further circumstantial evidence for this assumption. No TSH pulses and low basal TSH secretion were observed under basal conditions (1700-2400 h), whereas subsequent repetitive TRH challenge (25 micrograms/2 h to 50 micrograms/1 h) led to a pulsatile release of TSH with fusion of TSH pulses, resulting in a TSH secretion pattern strikingly similar to the circadian variation. These data suggest that pulsatile and circadian TSH secretions are predominantly controlled by TRH.\r"

PRL, LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), progesterone, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were measured. In both studies we detected a smaller PRL increase in response to suckling (P less than 0.001) and higher E2 levels (P less than 0.001) in nursing women who ovulated within 6 months postpartum compared to those in women who did not. Such differences were observed early after delivery when all women were fully nursing and amenorrheic. These results suggest some probable sources of variability in the duration of lactational amenorrhea in our population. The greater PRL response to suckling associated with longer amenorrhea may be due to higher sensitivity of the breast-hypothalamus-pituitary system or a stronger suckling stimulus in this group. Differences in plasma E2 levels between longer and shorter periods of amenorrhea may reflect dissimilar endogenous production, intake, or clearance of estrogens.\r"

We have now found in a third kindred, D, in which GTHR is inherited as a dominant disease, a new point mutation in the T3-binding domain of c-erbA beta. A guanine to cytosine base substitution at nucleotide position 1305, which altered codon-335 from glutamine (CAG) to histidine (CAC), was found in one allele of 10 affected members and was not found in 6 unaffected members. This C-1305 sequence was not present in 106 random alleles, indicating that it was a mutation in c-erbA beta, and it was tightly linked to GTHR in kindred D, with a maximum logarithm of the odds score of 4.19 at a recombination fraction of 0. The tight linkage result confirms that GTHR maps to the c-erbA beta locus in multiple kindreds. In view of the tight linkage between the C-1305 mutation and GTHR, and that this mutation is a nonconservative alteration in a crucial region of the T3-binding domain, it is probably the genetic defect in kindred D responsible for GTHR. The kindred D receptor appears to result in a different phenotype of tissue resistance compared to the previously reported kindred.

  ".W": "Central precocious puberty is effectively treated with long-acting LHRH analogs (LHRHas). Although at least six LHRHas have now been used in children, there have been no studies to determine the least effective dose of any of these analogs. We sought to determine the effect of decreasing an efficacious dose of deslorelin (D-Trp6-Pro9-NEt-LHRH) on basal and LHRH-stimulated gonadotropins, estradiol levels, and the rates of linear growth and skeletal maturation in subjects with central precocious puberty. Twenty-nine children with central precocious puberty were enrolled in a double blinded study. All subjects were treated for the initial 3 months with deslorelin at a dose (4 micrograms/kg.day, sc) known to suppress gonadotropins, linear growth velocity, and the rate of skeletal maturation. After 3 months, the subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of three daily sc doses of deslorelin: 4 micrograms/kg (n = 9), 2 micrograms/kg (n = 11), or 1 micrograms/kg (n = 9). They were treated at this dose in double blinded fashion for 15 months, after which time they resumed therapy at a dose of 4 micrograms/kg.day for an additional year. The children in the three groups did not differ in terms of chronological age, bone age, pretreatment growth rate, or Tanner stage at the onset of therapy. Similarly, there were no differences in the clinical and hormonal responses to the first 3 months of LHRHa therapy (4 micrograms/kg.day). During the 15-month period at the three different doses, the three dose groups could not be distinguished from each other in terms of pubertal stage, linear growth velocity, rate of skeletal maturation, sex steroid levels, mean LH or FSH levels, or peak FSH response to LHRH stimulation or to a dose of deslorelin. In contrast, the peak LH response to LHRH stimulation was highest in children treated with the lowest dose (1 micrograms/kg.day; P less than 0.025, by multiple analysis of variance). In addition, the peak LH response to a dose of deslorelin (the LHRHa test) was higher in children treated with 1 micrograms/kg.day than in those treated with 4 micrograms/kg.day (P less than 0.04). In summary, the LHRHa test is a sensitive means for detecting activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and deslorelin at a dose of 1 micrograms/kg.day results in less gonadotropin suppression than a dose of 4 micrograms/kg.day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether hyperinsulinemia can directly reduce serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, six obese women with this disorder were studied. Before study, ovarian steroid production was suppressed in each woman by the administration of 7.5 mg of a long-acting GnRH agonist, leuprolide depot, im, on days -56, -28, and 0. This resulted in substantial reductions in serum concentrations of testosterone (from 1.72 +/- 0.29 nmol/L on day -56 to 0.32 +/- 0.09 nmol/L on day 0), non-SHBG-bound testosterone (from 104 +/- 16 pmol/L on day -56 to 19 +/- 5 pmol/L on day 0), androstenedione (from 7.25 +/- 1.65 nmol/L on day -56 to 2.78 +/- 0.94 nmol/L on day 0), estrone (from 371 +/- 71 pmol/L on day -56 to 156 +/- 29 pmol/L on day 0), estradiol (from 235 +/- 26 pmol/L on day -56 to 90 +/- 24 pmol/L on day 0), and progesterone (from 0.28 +/- 0.12 nmol/L on day -56 to 0.08 +/- 0.02 nmol/L on day 0). Serum SHBG levels, however, did not change (18.8 +/- 2.8 nmol/L on day -56 vs. 17.8 +/- 2.6 nmol/L on day 0). While continuing leuprolide treatment, the women were administered oral diazoxide (300 mg/day) for 10 days to suppress serum insulin levels. Diazoxide treatment resulted in suppressed insulin release during a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (insulin area under the curve, 262 +/- 55 nmol/min.L on day 0 vs. 102 +/- 33 nmol/min.L on day 10; P less than 0.05) and deterioration of glucose tolerance. Serum testosterone, androstenedione, estrone, estradiol, and progesterone levels did not change during combined diazoxide and leuprolide treatment. In contrast, serum SHBG levels rose by 32% from 17.8 +/- 2.6 nmol/L on day 0 to 23.5 +/- 2.0 nmol/L on day 10 (P less than 0.003). Due primarily to the rise in serum SHBG levels, serum non-SHBG-bound testosterone levels fell by 43% from 19 +/- 5 pmol/L on day 0 to 11 +/- 4 pmol/L on day 10 (P = 0.05). These observations suggest that hyperinsulinemia directly reduces serum SHBG levels in obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome independently of any effect on serum sex steroids.\r"

This study demonstrates that CR postpones the documented age-related declines in and/or enhances the activity and microsomal concentration of several liver monooxygenases in male rats, i.e., NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase, total cytochromes P-450. However, the relative concentration of cytochrome P-450b+C did not exhibit statistically significant changes, whereas another isozyme, the male specific P-450h, declined significantly in both ad libitum-fed and CR rats as a function of increasing age. While CR appears to retard age-associated changes in certain liver enzymes, this effect is by no means universal. The hepatic monooxygenases constitute a well-characterized enzyme system in which to examine the perturbation of the aging process by CR.\r"

In the aged subjects, upward drift of VE, VO2, and HR was reduced compared with the young group. The recovery of VE, VCO2, and VO2 was slowed in the aged. However, at 10 minutes post-exercise, VCO2, VO2, and HR had returned to similar relative values for both groups; in the young subjects VE remained elevated at the end of recovery. The reduced upward drift of gas exchange variables and HR during exercise in aged subjects is consistent with an attenuated response of glycogenolysis and lactate production to adrenergic stimulation and/or to selective loss of type II skeletal muscle fibers. The slowed recovery of VE, VCO2, and VO2 in elderly persons is consistent with age-related reduced CO2 chemosensitivity, delaying elimination of the exercise-induced CO2 load.\r"

We found significantly higher levels of thrombin-antithrombin-III (TAT) complexes, lower levels of systemic tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, and higher levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity in the AMI patients compared to the UAP patients. In contrast to these specific changes, general acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor did not differ significantly between the two groups. Studies of the relationship between coagulation (TAT-complexes) and fibrinolysis data revealed a significant positive correlation between plasma antigen concentrations of TAT-complexes and t-PA (P less than 0.02), and between TAT-complexes and PAI-I (P less than 0.002). These observations indicate a common pathophysiological mechanism underlying the changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis, suggesting that coagulation activity and t-PA-related fibrinolysis are interrelated processes in vivo, and probably take place at the level of the endothelial cell.\r"

Eight healthy post-menopausal women received oral acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily for 28 d. Bone resorption, evaluated by serum acid phosphatase activity and the renal excretion of hydroxyproline, was unaltered, as was bone formation estimated by serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. The fasting renal excretion of calcium was increased, whereas serum ionized calcium was unchanged. The maximal renal reabsorption of phosphate decreased, but it was not an effect of PTH as it decreased significantly during the treatment period. In conclusion, no significant effect on biochemical markers of bone remodelling could be detected during the study period. The observed changes in calcium and phosphate metabolism may be secondary to the renal effect of acetazolamide.\r"

Carbon-14-urea (110 kBq) administered orally to 18 normal subjects and to 82 patients with Helicobacter infection. The exhaled 14C-labeled CO2 was trapped at 10-min intervals for 90 min. The total 14C activity exhaled over 90 min was integrated and expressed in %activity of the total dose given. In normals, a mean of 0.59% +/- 0.24% was measured, resulting in an upper limit of normal of 1.07%. In 82 patients, a sensitivity of 90.2%, a specificity of 83.8%, and a positive predictive value of 90.2% was found. The single probes at intervals of 40-60 min correlated best with the integrated result, with r ranging from 0.986 to 0.990. The test's diagnostic accuracy did not change at all when reevaluated with the 40-, 50-, or 60-min sample data alone. Thus, the 14C-urea breath test can be applied routinely as a noninvasive, low-cost and one-sample test with high diagnostic accuracy in detecting Helicobacter pylori colonization.\r"

The strategy that combined blood culture with empiric oral antibiotic treatment for all patients was predicted to prevent the highest number of major infections and to have the lowest cost per major infection prevented. The strategy that combined a leukocyte count and blood culture for all patients, followed by empiric antibiotic treatment for those with leukocyte count greater than or equal to 10,000/mm3, had almost equal cost and clinical effectiveness and avoided many antibiotic complications. Culture of blood specimens from all patients and no empiric treatment constituted the third most clinically effective intervention but was the least cost-effective in this model. Giving a 2-day oral course of amoxicillin without testing had the lowest average cost per febrile patient but was the least clinically effective intervention. However, the low degree of effectiveness of empiric treatment alone was based on the assumption that oral amoxicillin therapy was only 20% effective in preventing major infections after bacteremia. At higher estimates of effectiveness, treatment alone became a more viable strategy. We conclude that approaches which combine blood culture with empiric antibiotic treatment are the most clinically effective and the most cost-effective strategies for children at risk for occult bacteremia.\r"

Two patients with negative cultures had serologic evidence of infection with C. pneumoniae. None of 32 cultures for M. pneumoniae were positive, and although anti-M. pneumoniae IgM developed in two patients, one of these patients had evidence of C. pneumoniae infection (positive culture and seroconversion). We conclude that C. pneumoniae infection is prevalent in our sickle cell population with acute chest syndrome. Until further studies clarify the pathophysiologic significance of C. pneumoniae infection, we believe that early inclusion of erythromycin as antimicrobial therapy for acute chest syndrome seems reasonable.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that a high-fat parenteral regimen was beneficial for respiratory gas exchanges, in comparison with a high-glucose regimen, was tested in a paired crossover design. Ten parenterally fed newborn infants with no respiratory problems received two 5-day isoenergetic and isonitrogenous regimens that differed in their nonprotein source of energy; the level of fat intake (low fat (LF) 1 gm.kg-1.day-1; high fat (HF) 3 gm.kg-1.day-1) varied inversely with that of glucose. Continuous transcutaneous PO2 (tcPO2) and PCO2 (tcPCO2), respiratory gas exchange (indirect calorimetry), and plasma arachidonate metabolites were measured at the end of each regimen. Oxygen consumption and resting energy expenditure were not affected by modification of the source of energy. However, carbon dioxide production (VCO2) was higher during LF than during HF (6.9 +/- 0.2 vs 6.2 +/- 0.1 ml.kg-1.min-1; p less than 0.01), as was the respiratory quotient (1.08 +/- 0.02 vs 0.96 +/- 0.02; p less than 0.001). Despite the differences in VCO2, the tcPCO2 was not affected, suggesting adequate pulmonary compensation during LF, as documented by the higher minute ventilation (160 +/- 7 vs 142 +/- 5 ml.kg-1.min-1; p less than 0.01). The lower tcPO2 during the HF regimen (73.8 +/- 2.8 vs 68.8 +/- 2.6 mm Hg; p less than 0.015) indicated a disturbance at the alveolocapillary level induced by the lipid emulsion. No differences were found in circulating levels of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The substitution of glucose for lipid did not modify fat storage (2.1 +/- 0.3 vs 2.1 +/- 0.3 gm.kg-1.day-1). We conclude that the supposed beneficial effect of a fat emulsion on respiratory gas exchange is questionable.\r"

  ".U": "91094238\r", 
  ".W": "Besides its procoagulant activity, thrombin has been shown to stimulate cell proliferation and to regulate the fibrinolytic pathway. We report here the effect of purified human alpha thrombin on the synthesis of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) by cultured human mesangial cells. Thrombin (0 to 2.5 U/ml) increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner the production of t-PA and PAI-1 (2- to 3-fold increase of secreted t-PA and PAI-1 release during a 24 hour incubation). This effect was associated with a twofold increase in DNA synthesis measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Zymographic analysis and reverse fibrin autography showed that thrombin also increased the level of the 110 Kd t-PA-PAI-1 complex, whereas PAI-1 was present as a free 50 Kd form in the culture medium conditioned by unstimulated and thrombin-stimulated cells. Free t-PA was never observed. Both membrane binding and catalytic activity of thrombin were required since the effects of 1 U/ml thrombin were inhibited by addition 2 U/ml hirudin, which inhibits the membrane binding and catalytic activity of thrombin, and since DFP-inactivated thrombin, which has the ability to bind but which has no enzymatic activity, did not induce t-PA or PAI-1. Gamma thrombin, which does not bind to thrombin receptor, did not increase t-PA and PAI-1 releases. The effects of thrombin were probably mediated by protein kinase C activation since H7, an inhibitor of protein kinases, inhibited significantly thrombin effects on t-PA and PAI-1 production, and since addition of an activator of protein kinase A, 8-bromocyclic AMP (100 microM), induced a significant inhibition of the thrombin effect. The effects of thrombin were also suppressed by 1.25 micrograms/ml alpha amanitin, suggesting a requirement of de novo RNA synthesis. Northern blot analysis indicated that thrombin induced an increase in the mRNA levels of t-PA and of PAI-1. We conclude that thrombin increases DNA synthesis in human mesangial cells and enhances the synthesis of both t-PA and PAI-1. The latter is released in a large excess as compared to t-PA. Hence, thrombin may have a role in provoking a localized hypofibrinolytic state and may contribute to the persistence of glomerular fibrin deposits during proliferative glomerulonephritis.\r"

Average levels of IgG and IgA immediately before surgery were significantly higher in esophageal cancer patients with postoperative septic complications than in those without such problems. Preoperative radiation therapy and total parenteral nutrition did not significantly alter the levels of immunoglobulins and complements.

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increases the risk of tuberculosis and may interfere with the effectiveness of antituberculosis chemotherapy. To examine the outcomes in patients with both diagnoses, we conducted a retrospective study of all 132 patients listed in both the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and tuberculosis case registries in San Francisco from 1981 through 1988. RESULTS. At the time of the diagnosis of tuberculosis, 78 patients (59 percent) did not yet have a diagnosis of AIDS, 18 patients (14 percent) were given a concomitant diagnosis of AIDS (as determined by the presence of an AIDS-defining disease other than tuberculosis), and the remaining 36 patients (27 percent) already had AIDS. The manifestations of tuberculosis were entirely pulmonary in 50 patients (38 percent), entirely extrapulmonary in 40 patients (30 percent), and both pulmonary and extrapulmonary in 42 patients (32 percent). The treatment regimens were as follows: isoniazid and rifampin supplemented by ethambutol for the first two months, 52 patients; isoniazid and rifampin supplemented by pyrazinamide and ethambutol for the first two months, 39 patients; isoniazid and rifampin, 13 patients; isoniazid and rifampin supplemented by pyrazinamide for the first two months, 4 patients; and other drug regimens, 17 patients. The intended duration of treatment for patients whose regimen included pyrazinamide was six months, and for patients who did not receive pyrazinamide, nine months. Seven patients received no treatment because tuberculosis was first diagnosed after death. Sputum samples became clear of acid-fast organisms after a median of 10 weeks of therapy. Abnormalities on all chest radiographs taken after three months of treatment were stable or improved except for those of patients who had new nontuberculous infections. The only treatment failure occurred in a man infected with multiple drug-resistant organisms who did not comply with therapy. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 23 patients (18 percent). For all 125 treated patients, median survival was 16 months from the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis was a major contributor to death in 5 of the 7 untreated patients and 8 of the 125 treated patients. Three of 58 patients who completed therapy had a relapse (5 percent); compliance was poor in all 3. CONCLUSIONS. Tuberculosis causes substantial mortality in patients with advanced HIV infection. In patients who comply with the regimen, conventional therapy results in rapid sterilization of sputum, radiographic improvement, and low rates of relapse.\r"

The underlying metabolic and genetic defects in FCHL have not been identified, but a population study has suggested an association between FCHL and an XmnI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) within the apolipoprotein AI-CIII-AIV gene cluster. Here we confirm this association and show that it results from linkage disequilibrium between FCHL and the 6.6-kilobase (kb) allele of the XmnI RFLP. Subsequent analysis in seven FCHL families, ascertained through a proband carrying the 6.6 kb XmnI allele, demonstrated linkage to the AI-CIII-AIV cluster on 11q23-q24, zeta = 6.86 with no recombinants. This assignment will facilitate the identification of the mutation that causes hyperlipidaemia in these families.\r"

The Cys2/His2 zinc-finger class has conserved motifs of 28-30 amino acids which are usually present as tandem repeats. The structure of a Cys2/His2 zinc finger has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance, but details of its interaction with DNA were not established. Here we identify amino acids governing DNA-binding specificity using in vitro directed mutagenesis guided by similarities between the zinc fingers of transcription factors Sp1 and Krox-20. Krox-20 is a serum-inducible transcription activator which is possibly involved in the regulation of hindbrain development; it contains three zinc fingers similar to those of Sp1 and binds to a 9-base-pair target sequence which is related to that of Sp1. Our results show that each finger spans three nucleotides and indicate two positions in Krox-20 zinc fingers that are important for base-pair selectivity. Modelling with molecular graphics suggests that these residues could bind directly with the bases and that other amino acid-base contacts are also possible.\r"

Recognition of predisposing factors is also improving, as is localization of disease in the ethmoid, maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses. Because of the interdependence of the sinuses, acute sinusitis is rarely limited to one sinus. The diagnosis of acute disease is relatively easy compared with that of chronic sinusitis, which mimics many other conditions. Antibiotics and decongestants typically constitute initial therapy for acute sinusitis, and surgery is reserved for patients with threatened complications. The principal goal of this symposium is to outline the most rational approach to treatment of sinus disease on the basis of currently available diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Emphasis will be placed on first-line management, on therapeutic response, and on objective evaluation of therapeutic efficiency.\r"

Anatomic abnormalities also predispose the patient to chronic sinusitis because of ostial blockage. Investigators have identified and detailed the prevalence of both aerobic and anaerobic environments within the sinuses, demonstrating that ostial blockage creates an ideal culture medium within the sinus. Keeping the ostial passageways open is essential to allow reversal of the sinusitis cycle, especially in the presence of predisposing factors.\r"

Nasal endoscopy provides a clear view of the anterior nasal cavity--including the middle meatus--in patients with symptoms of sinusitis. However, the maxillary ostia are still difficult to visualize directly. CT is required for noninvasive evaluation of deep ostiomeatal air passages and posterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. MRI of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, although of limited use for displaying nasal morphology, is even more sensitive than CT in identifying fungal concretions and neoplasms.\r"

Thus the otolaryngologist's role in the management of sinusitis goes beyond treatment of referred patients. It also includes the responsibility to educate referring physicians in improved diagnostic methods and earlier, more effective forms of therapy. While antral puncture is the sine qua non for determining specific diagnosis, standard radiographs and sound clinical judgment may offer practical alternatives. Early, aggressive antibiotic therapy (with ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, or appropriate cephalosporins), plus oral decongestants for symptomatic relief, provides therapeutic efficacy for acute sinusitis and should be considered the initial step toward prevention of chronic sinusitis.\r"

The relative inaccessibility of the sinus cavities makes special techniques of sampling necessary to acquire specimens that accurately reflect disease conditions in the sinuses. Bacterial etiology of sinus infection has therefore been determined by sinus puncture studies, chiefly of the maxillary sinus, several of which are reviewed here. Because the bacteria causing acute sinusitis have not changed in many years, puncture is not often necessary for clinical diagnosis. Patients with acute, community-acquired sinusitis can usually be treated empirically, on the basis of previous studies, unless complications are suspected. In that case, and in other patients with hospital-acquired sinusitis, puncture of the involved sinus and aspiration of sinus fluid for Gram's staining and quantitative microbial cultures and sensitivities are required for appropriate antimicrobial management.\r"

Pharmacologic measures include decongestants, topical corticosteroids for chronic sinusitis, mucoevacuants, and analgesics. Antihistamines are indicated for acute sinusitis only when a patient with concomitant allergies is symptomatic during the allergy season or after infection has been ruled out as the primary cause of sinusitis. Sinusitis may be associated with asthma, and some patients do not respond optimally to asthma therapy until their sinusitis is diagnosed and treated.\r"

Now, nasal endoscopy has disproved this belief by showing that chronic sinusitis is primarily a disease of obstruction, with inflammation as a secondary manifestation. Once obstruction is surgically corrected and ventilation restored, the mucosa may regain near-normal appearance and function. For chronic sinusitis that fails to respond to antibiotic therapy--and for recurrent acute sinusitis associated with abnormalities of the ostiomeatal complex--functional endoscopic sinus surgery offers the patient real hope of permanent relief from symptoms of sinusitis. Careful postoperative follow-up with endoscopic evaluation enhances effectiveness of this more recent approach to sinus surgery. The importance of presurgical evaluation via endoscopy and computed tomography cannot be overemphasized.\r"

Intraclonal isotype switching occurs, and a variety of immunoglobulin isotypes, including IgA, is secreted. Memory cells, which generate clones secreting IgA exclusively, are only rarely identified in the GC B-cell subset. Such memory cells can, however, be readily identified among unfractionated Peyer's patch B cells, and in non-GC subsets of B cells. The results suggest that the GC does not contain IgA memory cells that can be restimulated in vitro to secrete only IgA. When division of GC B cells is prevented by irradiation or aphidicholin treatment, a large subset that secretes IgA as the sole immunoglobulin isotype is seen, and the output of presumably single B cells is large enough to be scored by RIA. Both helper T cells and dendritic cells are required for the phenomenon. The data indicate that commitment to IgA secretion occurs in Peyer's patch GCs and suggest that the prolific cell division known to be supported in GCs may forestall terminal differentiation of preplasmablasts to immunoglobulin secretion.\r"

We have now demonstrated that immunization of C3H/HeN mice by syngeneic nontumorigenic fibroblast-like cells that contain the transfected HPV-16 E7 gene conferred protection against transplanted cells from a HPV-16 E7-positive syngeneic tumor. This protection was HPV-16 E7-specific and was mediated by CD8+ lymphocytes, which presumably were cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These results indicate that tumor cells containing HPV-16 E7, either as a result of transfection, as in our studies, or naturally, as occurs in many human carcinomas, can induce a tumor-specific rejection response and serve as targets for such a response. The system described here provides an animal model to further study immune responses to HPV-associated malignancies and to test the efficacy of anti-HPV vaccines toward the therapy and prevention of such tumors.\r"

Degradation of labeled proteins was monitored in the ubiquitin cell-free system. ATP stimulated the degradation of all the proteins between 3- and 10-fold. The degradation was completely inhibited by neutralizing antibody directed against the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, the first enzyme in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic cascade. Moreover, degradation in E1-depleted lysates could be restored in each case by the addition of affinity-purified E1. These data suggest that the ubiquitin system mediates the degradation of these oncoproteins in vitro. Degradation of other proteins, such as superoxide dismutase, cytochrome c, enolase, RNase A, and ornithine decarboxylase, is not mediated by the ubiquitin cell-free system. This suggests that the nuclear oncoproteins studied here possess specific signals that target them for rapid turnover by this proteolytic pathway. Furthermore, the relative sensitivity to degradation of various E1A mutants in vivo is also maintained in the cell-free system, suggesting that the ubiquitin pathway may play a role in the cellular degradation of these proteins as well.\r"

  ".W": "The pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease is the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in the brains of patients. Plaque cores contain a 4- to 5-kDa amyloid beta-protein fragment which is also found in the cerebral blood vessels of affected individuals. Since amyloid deposition in the brain increases with age even in normal people, we sought to establish whether the disease state bears a direct relationship with normal aging processes. As a model for biological aging, the process of cellular senescence in vitro was used. mRNA levels of beta-amyloid precursor protein associated with Alzheimer disease were compared in human fibroblasts in culture at early passage and when the same fibroblasts were grown to senescence after more than 52 population doublings. A dramatic increase in mRNA was observed in senescent IMR-90 fibroblasts compared with early-passage cells. Hybridization of mRNA from senescent and early proliferating fibroblasts with oligonucleotide probes specific for the three alternatively spliced transcripts of the gene gave similar results, indicating an increase during senescence of all three forms. A similar, though more modest, increase in message levels was also observed in early-passage fibroblasts made quiescent by serum deprivation; with repletion of serum, however, the expression returned to previous low levels. ELISAs were performed on cell extracts from senescent, early proliferating, and quiescent fibroblasts, and quiescent fibroblasts repleted with serum for over 48 hr, using polyclonal antibodies to a synthetic peptide of the beta-amyloid precursor. The results confirmed that the differences in mRNA expression were partially reflected at the protein level. Regulated expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein may be an important determinant of growth and metabolic responses to serum and growth factors under physiological as well as pathological conditions.\r"

The tumors were hypomelanotic and were histopathologically similar to corresponding human melanomas. Eye melanomas often originated at a young age, chiefly from the retinal pigment epithelium, also from the choroid, and rarely from the ciliary body. The eye tumors grew aggressively, were highly invasive, and metastasized to local and distant sites. The earliest formation of these tumors was associated with higher copy numbers of the transgene; mice of different single-copy lines varied greatly in age of onset and frequency of eye tumors. Coat pigmentation was reduced in almost all lines, to various extents. Primary skin melanomas arose later and less frequently than eye melanomas. Hence they were at early stages and of unknown long-range incidence in this investigation, in which autopsies covered the first half-year of life. For both ocular and cutaneous melanomas, the transgenic mice offer numerous possibilities for experimental study of mechanisms underlying formation and spread of melanomas.\r"

Pigmentation in a given animal was attributable to any or all of the following; an increase in numbers of some normally pigmented cells of neural crest origin (a result compatible with early stages of transformation); elicitation of melanin synthesis in some cells that normally have little melanin, or none at all (the latter possibly signaling metaplasia); unusual intercellular transfer of pigment granules from melanocytes into certain normally unpigmented epithelia and endothelia; and profusion of melanin-phagocytizing cells. Neoplasms, occasionally also containing melanin, arose in association with some of these melanotic tissues and included three choroid plexus tumors, three endocardial tumors, two peripheral nerve sheath tumors (schwannomas), two cochlear tumors, two pineal gland tumors, one salivary gland tumor, and one nasal mucosa tumor. These apparently originated independently of the ocular and cutaneous melanomas found in the same animals. The events involved in melanosis may thus contribute to neoplastic conversion.\r"

It has been reported that a change from 472-U to 472-C in the type 3 OPV RNA is associated with an increased histologic lesion score produced upon intraspinal inoculation of the mutant virus in monkeys. We have developed a method, based on polymerase chain reaction, for measuring the relative abundance of these mutant sequences directly in vaccine preparations and used this method to evaluate the proportion of 472-C in 40 different lots of type 3 OPV. Six vaccine lots that had failed the intraspinal monkey neurovirulence test contained a higher proportion of 472-C than all other lots that had passed this test. OPV type 3 virus containing 472-C was rapidly selected during serial passages in African green monkey kidney cells that are used for manufacturing of the vaccine. We have also found that the wild-type poliovirus type 3 strain Leon/37, from which the vaccine strain was originally derived, contained a mixture of 472-U and 472-C sequences. No other mutations in OPV type 3 RNA have been detected by similar assays at position 2034, also associated with attenuation, or at several other positions reported to be altered in some vaccine preparations. Our results suggest that molecular diagnostics may provide a supplement or a potential alternative to animal testing of live attenuated vaccines.\r"

  ".U": "91095433\r", 
  ".W": "Many eukaryotic transcriptional activator proteins contain a DNA-binding domain that interacts with specific promoter sequences and an acidic activation region that is required to stimulate transcription. Transcriptional enhancement by such activator proteins is often synergistic and promiscuous; promoters containing multiple binding sites for an individual protein or even for unrelated proteins can be 10-100 times more active than promoters with single sites. It has been suggested that such synergy reflects a nonlinear response of the basic transcription machinery to the number and/or quality of acidic activation regions. Here, we determine the transcriptional activity of Jun-Fos heterodimers containing one or two GCN4 acidic activation regions on promoters containing one or two Ap-1 target sites. Surprisingly, heterodimers with one or two acidic regions activate transcription with similar efficiency and are equally synergistic (10- to 15-fold) on promoters containing two target sites. Thus, transcriptional synergy does not depend on the number of acidic activation regions but rather on the number of proteins bound to the promoter. This suggests that synergy is mediated either by cooperative DNA binding or by alternative mechanisms in which the DNA-binding domain plays a more direct role in transcription (e.g., changes in DNA structure, nucleosome displacement, or direct interactions with the transcriptional machinery).\r"

We have identified a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific for rap in plasma membranes isolated from differentiated HL60 cells. The rap GAP activity remained quantitatively associated with the membrane following washes with buffered 1 M LiCl containing 20 mM EDTA but was solubilized with the detergents Nonidet P-40 and deoxycholate. On the basis of size-exclusion chromatography, the membrane-associated rap GAP (rap GAPm) appeared distinct from the rap GAP detected in the cytosolic fraction from HL60 cells. The molecular sizes of the membrane and cytosolic forms were estimated to be 36 and 54 A, respectively. rap GAPm was solubilized and purified to near homogeneity by successive column chromatographies in the presence of detergent. The rap GAPm activity corresponded to a single polypeptide that migrated with a molecular mass of approximately 88 kDa on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. The purified rap GAPm was inactive toward the GTP-bound forms of p21ras, rho, G25K, and rac-1 and did not stimulate dissociation of guanine nucleotide from rap.\r"

These data reveal two very similar coding sequences, which we have denoted \"A-type\" and \"G-type.\" We have obtained complete A-type sequences coding for functional units Ode and Odf; consequently a total of three such unit sequences are now known from a single subunit of one molluscan hemocyanin. This presents the opportunity to make sequence comparisons within one hemocyanin subunit. Domains within one subunit show on the average 42% identity in amino acid residues; corresponding functional units from hemocyanins of different species show degrees of identity of 53-75%. Therefore, molluscan hemocyanins already existed before the individual molluscan classes diverged in the early Cambrian. Sequence comparisons of molluscan hemocyanins with arthropodan hemocyanins and tyrosinases allow us to identify the ligands of the \"Copper B\" site with high probability. Possible ligands for the \"Copper A\" site are proposed, based on sequence comparisons between molluscan hemocyanins and tyrosinases. Besides two histidine side chains, a methionine side chain might be involved in binding of Copper A, a result not in conflict with spectroscopic studies.\r"

Mutations in Pc-group genes show strong posterior transformations in homozygous embryos resulting from an ectopic expression of homeotic genes in segments where they are not supposed to be active. Genetic evidence suggests that Pc is part of a cellular memory mechanism responsible for the transmission of the homeotic expression pattern through developmental time. We have determined the nucleotide sequence for the genomic DNA of the Pc gene and for cDNAs corresponding to the 2.5-kilobase Pc mRNA. The deduced sequence of the Pc protein exhibits a homology to the heterochromatin-associated protein HP1 encoded by the suppressor of position effect variegation gene Su(var) 205. The homology is confined to a 37-amino acid domain in the N-terminal part of the two proteins. Our findings extend to the molecule level the genetically identified parallels between the Pc-group genes and the modifiers of position effect variegation. This suggests that Pc could use analogous mechanisms at the level of the higher order chromatin structure for the stable transmission of a determined state, as has been proposed for the clonal propagation of heterochromatin domains.\r"

We demonstrated that proteolytic digests of 3H-methylated G25K contained radiolabeled material that coeluted with synthetic S-(geranylgeranyl)cysteine methyl ester on reversed-phase HPLC. Further treatment by performic acid oxidation yielded radiolabeled material that coeluted with L-cysteic acid methyl ester, verifying that the isoprenoid moiety and carboxyl methyl ester are localized on a C-terminal cysteine residue. Analysis by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry of material released from purified G25K by Raney nickel treatment positively identified the covalently bound lipid as an all-trans-geranylgeranyl (C20) isoprenoid moiety. These results suggest that geranylgeranyl modification and perhaps methyl esterification function in the membrane localization of this small G protein.\r"

Smooth muscle cells also synthesize HBGF-2; thus, it may stimulate their proliferation in vivo by both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. We report here that HBGF-2 gene expression in human saphenous vein smooth muscle cells is induced by interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, inflammatory cytokines produced by many cell types in response to a variety of signals. Maximal HBGF-2 mRNA levels are detected 2-4 hr after IL-1 treatment; induction may require de novo protein synthesis and does not occur if transcription is inhibited. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicates that IL-1-stimulated cells also express an increased amount of HBGF-2 protein. Interferon gamma and glucocorticoids, inhibitors of smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, suppress the induction of HBGF-2 expression by IL-1. These results imply that cytokines released at sites of vascular injury or inflammation may regulate HBGF-2 production by smooth muscle cells. Increased HBGF-2 levels within the vessel wall could play a role in both the smooth muscle cell proliferation and the neovascularization associated with the development of atherosclerotic lesions.\r"

  ".U": "91095457\r", 
  ".W": "We have generated seven site-specific mutations in the genes encoding the variable region of the heavy chain domain (VH) of the phosphocholine-binding antibody S107. S107 is a member of a family of well-characterized highly homologous antibodies that bind phosphorylcholine mono- and diesters. Two of these antibodies, MOPC-167 and T15, have previously been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl N-trimethylammonioethyl carbonate. Two conserved heavy-chain residues, Tyr-33 and Arg-52, were postulated to be involved in binding and hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenylcholine carbonate esters. To more precisely define the catalytic roles of these residues, three Arg-52 mutants (R52K, R52Q, R52C) and four Tyr-33 mutants (Y33H, Y33F, Y33E, Y33D) of antibody S107 were generated. The genes encoding the VH binding domain of S107 were inserted into plasmid pUC-fl, and in vitro mutagenesis was performed. The wild-type and mutant S107 antibodies were expressed in P-3X63-Ag8.653 (P-3) myeloma cells by using a modified SV2 shuttle vector. The catalytic properties of wild-type antibody S107 are similar to those of the phosphocholine-specific antibody T15, which has the same VH protein sequence. In general, mutations at Tyr-33 had little effect on catalytic activity, whereas mutations at Arg-52 that result in loss of the positively charged side chain significantly lower the catalytic activity of S107. One mutant, Y33H, catalyzed the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl N-trimethylammonioethyl carbonate with a kcat of 5.7 min-1 and a Km of 1.6 mM at pH 7.5. These results not only demonstrate the importance of electrostatic interactions in catalysis by antibody S107 but also show that catalytic side chains can be introduced into antibodies to enhance their catalytic efficiency.\r"

Analyses using circular dichroism and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy now demonstrate that binding alpha/beta-type SASPs to DNA in vitro causes a structural change in DNA, from the B to the A conformation. This may provide the basis whereby alpha/beta-type SASPs confer increased spore UV resistance in vivo--by changing spore DNA conformation, they alter DNA photochemistry such that UV irradiation produces spore photoproduct instead of the more lethal cyclobutane-type thymine dimers.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of interleukin-2 (IL-2) signal transduction was analyzed by use of an inducible B lymphoma. Like normal antigen-activated B lymphocytes, the lymphoma cells respond to IL-2 by proliferating and differentiating into antibody-secreting cells; both responses are blocked by a second interleukin, IL-4. Analyses of the signaling pathway showed that IL-2 stimulated the rapid hydrolysis of an inositol-containing glycolipid to yield two possible second messengers, a myristylated diacylglycerol and an inositol phosphate-glycan. The myristylated diacylglycerol response exhibited the same IL-2 dose dependence as the growth and differentiative responses, and the generation of both hydrolysis products was inhibited by IL-4. These correlations implicate the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol system in the intracellular relay of the IL-2 signal.\r"

In whole animal cell sorting (WACS), live cells derived from animals harboring a lacZ transgene are purified according to their level of beta-galactosidase expression with a fluorogenic beta-galactosidase substrate and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. With WACS, incipient posterior compartment cells that express the engrailed gene were purified from early Drosophila embryos. Neuronal precursor cells were also purified, and they differentiated into neurons with high efficiency in culture. Because there are many lacZ strains, it may be possible to purify most types of Drosophila cells. The same approach is also applicable to other organisms for which germ-line transformation is possible.\r"

  ".W": "Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) combined with ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) in the thoracic spine can result in serious myelopathy, leading to circumferential compression of the spinal cord in advanced stages of the disease. The authors performed circumspinal decompression (circumferential decompression of the spinal cord) on these patients. This operation consists of two steps: posterior and lateral decompression of the spinal cord by removal of the OLF (first step) and anterior removal of the OPLL for anterior decompression (second step), followed by interbody fusion. In the first step, two deep parallel gutters, covering the extent of the OPLL to be removed anteriorly, are drilled down from the rear into the vertebral body along both sides of the dura to easily and safely remove the OPLL anteriorly at the second step. In the second step, the surgical approach varies according to the affected level; costotransversectomy in the upper thoracic spine and standard thoracotomy in the middle or lower thoracic spine. According to the authors, circumspinal decompression is not an easy procedure, but from their results in 10 patients, they identify it as a radical and promising surgical procedure.\r"

The aim was to excise a space-occupying lesion, which exists in front of the thoracic or lumbar spinal cord, safely. This modification enable the authors to expose more than 50% of the spinal canal, and decompress it from its anterior, lateral, and posterior compressing mass. The utmost important point of this procedure is the excision of the lesion under the direct visualization of the dura. In ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), the dura is usually indented by the thick bony mass, and the lesion extends over a few segment with adhesion. Using \"Modified Lateral Rhachotomy,\" it was possible to explore three or four vertebral levels in continuity through the same skin incision. In the present report, the authors described their \"Modified Lateral Rhachotomy\" procedure, and reviewed the case material.\r"

This polyvinylchloride (PVC) container plasticized with butyryl-n-trihexyl-citrate (BTHC) is a new material for blood storage; it contains no di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). After removal of plasma and buffy coat, the red cells were suspended in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM) medium. After 42-day refrigerator storage, the total adenine nucleotide concentration remained the same as the initial concentration in the red cells, whereas ATP levels had decreased to 61 percent of the initial value. The 2,3 DPG concentration was 62 percent of normal on Day 7 and 21 percent on Day 14. Glucose consumption, lactate production, potassium leakage from red cells, and pH levels were similar to those found after storage in DEHP-plasticized containers under the same conditions. After 42 days, hemolysis levels were 0.56 +/- 0.21 percent and 0.42 +/- 0.17 percent in two series of units mixed weekly and 0.70 +/- 0.27 percent in units stored unmixed. Although even higher levels of hemolysis were observed in the units stored unmixed and used for 24-hour posttransfusion survival, the autologous red cell recovery results were excellent (83.2 +/- 5.1%, n = 8). BTHC-plasticized PVC is found to be a suitable material for 42-day storage of red cells in SAGM solution.\r"

The effect of irradiation on the biologic activity of a number of coagulation factors in plasma and in lyophilized concentrates of factor VIII (FVIII) and prothrombin complex was examined. A recovery of 85 percent of the biologic activity of therapeutic components present in frozen plasma and in lyophilized coagulation factor concentrates was reached at radiation doses as low as 1.5 and 0.5 Mrad, respectively. As derived from the first-order radiation inactivation curves, the radiosensitive target size of HIV was estimated to be 1 to 3 MDa; the target size of FVIII was estimated to be 130 to 160 kDa. Gamma radiation must be disregarded as a method for the sterilization of plasma and plasma-derived products, because of the low reduction of virus infectivity at radiation doses that still give acceptable recovery of biologic activity of plasma components.\r"

In the two children of the couple, who inherited a normal r or Ro from their mother, the paternally derived RN encoded an amount of rhi that could be detected in direct typing tests. In the father, lack of production of rhi by RN may have represented a suppressive effect of the ce(f) gene in trans to RN or the presence of an unlinked suppressor of Rh that might also have been responsible for the reduced production of f by his r or Ro gene. The two children in this family are the first persons in whom RN has been shown to make rhi.\r"

The patients had received goserelin acetate for ten, sixteen, and thirty months prior to discontinuing the drug because of progressive metastatic disease. In all 3 patients, PSA and testosterone levels increased after goserelin acetate was discontinued. In 2 patients the testosterone level reached normal levels. A bilateral orchiectomy was performed one hundred sixty, one hundred, and seven days, respectively, after the drug was discontinued. In all 3 cases PSA and testosterone levels were reduced following castration, although PSA levels again began to increase within two weeks of orchiectomy in 2 of the 3 patients. These findings suggest that suppression of testosterone by LHRH agonists is not permanent and if tumor progression occurs, maintaining hormone suppression may still be beneficial.\r"

Eighty-one patients were randomly allocated to receive Zoladex and 83 to orchiectomy. The median follow-up time for all patients was two hundred ten days. Median serum levels of testosterone were reduced to castrate levels (less than 50 ng/dL) within four weeks in both groups and remained suppressed for up to sixty weeks. An objective response according to modified criteria of the National Prostatic Cancer Project was observed in 81 percent and 78 percent of patients in the Zoladex and orchiectomy groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the distributions of time to treatment failure or time to disease progression. The most commonly reported adverse events in both treatment groups were hot flashes, cancer-related pain, unspecified pain, and urinary symptoms. These results suggest that Zoladex may offer an alternative to orchiectomy in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.\r"

In this lecture, a recently published series of 910 cases of chronic interstitial lung disease is used to show that these descriptive terms can be reorganized into a classification that is based on inflammatory and neoplastic processes. The proposed classification includes three major diagnostic categories, two of which are based on the chronic inflammatory response and a third that results from infiltration of the interstitial space by neoplastic cells of either a benign, borderline, or frankly malignant nature. An argument is presented that the steps involved in the development of the endstage of chronic interstitial lung disease are similar in all three groups. The advantage of this new classification is that it shifts the emphasis from descriptive terminology to pathogenesis, which provides a more critical basis for investigation of the causes of these diseases.\r"
