  ".W": "Pressure threshold is the minimal pressure (force) which induces pain. The pressure threshold meter (PTM) is a force gauge with a rubber disc of 1 cm2 surface. The instrument has been proven to be useful in clinical practice for quantification of deep muscle tenderness. Trigger points, fibrositis, myalgic spots, activity of arthritis as well as assessment of sensitivity to pain can be diagnosed by PTM. This study therefore established standards for pressure threshold as well as the reproducibility and validity of measurement in 24 male and 26 female normal volunteers at 9 sites. Muscles frequently afflicted by trigger points were examined. The deltoid was chosen as a reference since it is rarely a site for trigger points. Comparison of corresponding muscles on opposite sides failed to demonstrate significant differences (except for 1 muscle in females). These identical results obtained over muscles of opposite sides proved the excellent reproducibility and validity of pressure threshold measurement. Results serve as a reference for clinical diagnosis of abnormal tenderness and for documentation of treatment results. The sensitivity of individual muscles varies. Therefore the results presented should be kept in mind when diagnosis of pathological tenderness by palpation is attempted.\r"

The study was carried out with 8 inpatients affected with a unilateral sciatica resulting from an X-ray identified dorsal root compression from discal origin. The sural nerve was electrically stimulated at the ankle level while BEPs were recorded monopolarly from the vertex. The stimulus intensity eliciting a liminal nociceptive reflex response in a knee-flexor muscle associated with a liminal pain was selected for this study. Both normal and affected side were alternatively stimulated during several conditions of controls and of Lasegue's manoeuvres performed on the normal and on the affected side. Results show that the Lasegue manoeuvre performed on the affected side induced a significant increase in the amplitude of N150-P220; performed on the normal side, this same manoeuvre resulted in a significant decrease of the N150-P220 amplitude. These variations were observed whatever was the side (normal or affected) under sural nerve stimulation. The possible neural mechanisms of these changes and clinical implications of these data are then discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The heat beam dolorimeter (HBD) was developed to evaluate cutaneous pain thresholds in humans. In the present study, the hypothesis that a patient's underlying pain status affects his pain tolerance to an incident HBD stimulus was tested. Twenty-seven chronic pain patients with a variety of clinical problems unresponsive to conventional algological therapy were scheduled for neurosurgical procedures. These patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively by the HBD procedure. On initial testing, drug-free pain patients showed significantly higher pain tolerance thresholds than normal volunteers (P less than 0.02, Mann-Whitney U test). Postoperatively, incident pain tolerance thresholds in the HBD test were reduced from pre-surgical levels in these patients and were indistinguishable from the second evaluation latencies of volunteers (P greater than 0.05). Twenty-four of the 27 patients reported significant pain relief following surgery. Our results show that, in chronic pain patients, endogenous pain significantly affected incident pain perception in the HBD test when compared with the responses of normal pain-free volunteers. Consequently, HBD may be useful in objectively assessing chronic pain and its relief by neurosurgical procedures.\r"

Three hundred and fifty-three randomly selected patients reported experiencing pain during this hospitalization; 58% of these patients experienced excruciating pain. Fewer than half of the patients with pain had a member of the health care team ask them about their pain or note the pain in the patient record. The methods perceived as most effective in decreasing pain were analgesics, sleep, immobilization and distraction. As in earlier studies, the dose of analgesic administered over a 24-h period was less than a quarter of the amount ordered. This study concluded that (1) pain in hospitalized patients is more prevalent than has previously been reported, (2) patients with pain continue to receive inadequate dosages of analgesics, and (3) the identification and treatment of patients with pain remains a significant health care problem.\r"

Six hours after the cordotomy a new pain occurred in an analogous part of the body on the opposite side; the intensity increased gradually and it became as severe as the original within 1 week. Reference of sensation from analgesic area of cordotomy to the opposite side of the body was induced by noxious stimuli. Intrathecal phenol block to the nerves conveying the cancer pain abolished the new pain and the reference of sensation from this blocked area, though it remained unchanged in other analgesic areas of cordotomy. This substantiates that the new pain was a reference of the original cancer pain.\r"

The development of autotomy was observed over a 6 week period. The axotomized animals autotomized more than those injected with RCA I. A neuroma developed on the proximal stump of the axotomized nerves. Within 7 days the axons of the RCA I-injected nerve degenerated and the cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia L4 and L5 were destroyed. Since the RCA I-injected animals autotomized, it is concluded that purely central factors have a role in the generation of this abnormal behavior. As the axotomized animals autotomized more than the RCA I-treated ones it is further concluded that abnormal impulse activity arising from a neuroma may be an additional factor in causing autotomy.\r"

Interaction with the patients can be difficult as they are physically but not emotionally or sexually mature. There is no cure for some of the causes of amenorrhea, and others by their nature dictate that the woman will never bear children. In some cases, there are sexual identification problems with differences between the chromosomal, gonadal, and phenotypic sex of a person. Other cases require extensive operative procedures with associated acceptance and adjustment problems. The evaluation and treatment of adolescent amenorrhea therefore challenge the physician on several fronts. There is much satisfaction to be gained in meeting this challenge well.\r"

Twenty of these children had acute otitis media caused by pneumococci of type/group 3, 6, 18 or 19, whereas 20 received an injection of 14-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine. Many of the children in both groups had large concentrations of IgG and/or IgM class anti-CPS antibodies in their first serum sample. Both the infection and the vaccine elicited anti-CPS responses in all three immunoglobulin classes, most notably IgA. The pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides used as antigens in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were found to contain CPS in amounts ranging from less than 1 to 30%. As a result the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detected both anti-type-specific and anti-CPS antibodies. After elimination of the anti-CPS, type-specific pneumococcal antibodies were found only occasionally and in low concentrations in serum samples obtained in the acute phase of otitis or before vaccination. The infection induced homologous type-specific pneumococcal antibodies to varying degrees depending on the type: regularly to type 3; and fairly regularly to type 18C polysaccharide, but seldom to type 6 or 19. The pneumococcal vaccine induced type-specific antibodies to all four types measured, but the response to type 6A was poor.\r"

Epinephrine stimulation tests done in 3 patients excluded the possibility of excessive margination as a cause of neutropenia or leukopenia. In 3 neutropenic or leukopenic patients bone marrow examination showed hemophagocytosis with an increased number of histiocytes that had phagocytized neutrophils, red blood cells and platelets. This phenomenon was not seen in the bone marrow of 3 patients with normal white blood cell counts. Hemophagocytosis is an important mechanism in producing neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in several infectious and noninfectious disorders.\r"

Seventy-one percent of children less than 3 years of age had diarrhea, compared with 17% of children 3 to 8 years old. The duration of illness was 1 to 42 days (median, 8 days). At least one stool specimen was obtained from 142 (76%) of the 186 children. Children who had had diarrhea were more likely to have a specimen positive for Cryptosporidium (27 of 77, 35%) than were children who had not had diarrhea (8 of 65, 12%) (P less than 0.01). The presence of Giardia, Campylobacter, enterovirus, or rotavirus was not statistically associated with diarrhea. These results suggest Cryptosporidium as a causative agent. The secondary attack rate for diarrhea among household contacts exposed to DCC children with diarrhea was 77 of 204 (38%) compared with 25 of 273 (9%) for household contacts of children in the DCC who did not have diarrhea (P less than 0.001). Stool specimens were obtained from 79 household contacts. Six (23%) of 26 household members exposed to a Cryptosporidium-positive child had a stool specimen positive for Cryptosporidium, compared with 1 (2%) of 53 household contacts exposed to a DCC child whose stool specimen was negative for Cryptosporidium (P less than 0.01). The outbreak resolved within 2 weeks after cohorting children with diarrhea and stressing the importance of handwashing among staff and older children. cryptosporidium can cause outbreaks of diarrhea in DCC settings, can be spread within households and may be more common than previously recognized among DCC attendees and their household members.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the utility of Gram-stained smears and semiquantitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates (ETAs) in diagnosing pneumonia in intubated patients in a pediatric intensive care unit. The chest radiographs of 35 intubated patients were independently reviewed by a pediatric radiologist and classified into probable, possible and unlikely pneumonias. Concomitant bacteriologic and radiographic information was available in 15 episodes of probable and 13 of possible pneumonia. These findings were compared with the ETAs obtained during the study from patients with no radiographic evidence of pneumonia (N = 21). There was a good correlation between ETA findings and radiographic evidence of pneumonia when ETAs were obtained within 60 minutes of initial intubation. Only a growth of greater than or equal to 3+ of a pathogen was associated with probable pneumonia when ETAs were obtained more than 60 minutes from initial intubation. There was a poor correlation between the microbiologic findings from ETAs and the results of blood cultures and postmortem examinations. Moreover 5 of 10 pairs of ETAs obtained within 18 hours of each other demonstrated discordant results. The ETAs from patients with indwelling endotracheal tubes correlated poorly with radiographic findings and are of questionable value in diagnosing the presence of pneumonia or its etiology in this group. They must be cautiously interpreted in critically ill patients.\r"

There were seven patients (four boys, three girls), 7 to 22 months of age, who were evaluated for poor weight gain and linear growth. They were only consuming 60% to 94% of the recommended caloric intake for age and sex. The children's caloric intake had been restricted by their parents. They were concerned that the children would become obese, develop atherosclerosis, become junk food dependent, and/or develop eating habits that the parents believed were unhealthy. The parents instituted diets consistent with health beliefs currently in vogue and recommended by the medical community for adults who are at risk for cardiovascular disease. These diets caused the infants to experience inadequate weight gain and have a decreased linear growth rate. With nutritional counseling, all food restrictions were removed, the caloric intake was increased to 94% to 147% of the recommended intake for age. The weight gain rate increased significantly (P less than .05) from 0.1 +/- 0.1 kg/mo to 0.4 +/- 0.3 kg/mo, and the linear growth rate increased significantly (P less than .05) from 0.4 +/- 0.4 cm/mo to 1.0 +/- 0.6 cm/mo within 3 months of therapy. Exaggerated concerns about excessive food intake in childhood and/or concern about the sequelae of eating an improper diet has resulted in this entity of failure to thrive due to parental health beliefs.\r"

Foster care administrators, child welfare workers, foster parents, and health care providers responded to questionnaires and structured interviews performed by two pediatricians knowledgeable about the child welfare system. The organization of health services demonstrated a high degree of variability between counties. Although some counties initially evaluate all dependent children using specific protocols and examinations sites, more often services were poorly organized, fragmented, and had few safeguards to ensure delivery of appropriate health care. Use of recommended Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment services was also variable, and counties could not provide documentation of use rates by foster children. Even less consistent was the performance of routine initial mental health assessments. Financial disincentives, fewer available providers, difficulties in obtaining and using Medicaid-reimbursed services, and fragmentation of services were frequently identified as barriers to access. To improve the organization and delivery of services, access barriers must be diminished, services must be better organized and integrated, and new financing mechanisms must be developed. Specific policy recommendations are presented.\r"

The organisms have been identified in biopsy specimens of the gastric antrum by staining sections with silver stain. To determine the frequency of colonization of the antral mucosa with C pyloridis in association with gastritis in childhood, we retrospectively reviewed 53 cases in patients (mean age 11.9 years) in whom upper endoscopy with antral biopsy was performed for the evaluation of symptoms referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract. A silver impregnation method was used to detect the presence of C pyloridis. Nineteen of 53 antral biopsy specimens showed evidence of mucosal inflammation. Ten of these 19 patients had no apparent predisposing etiology for gastritis, and six of these ten had C pyloridis identified on antral biopsies. Nine of the 19 patients had secondary causes of gastric inflammation (two gastroduodenal Crohn disease, two eosinophilic gastroenteritis, four drug related, and one dys-gamma-globulinemia and lymphonodular hyperplasia). In contrast, none of these nine patients had C pyloridis demonstrated on antral biopsies. Silver stain for C pyloridis was negative in all 34 of the 53 children who had normal antral histologic findings. C pyloridis was not demonstrated by silver stain on any of the duodenal sections, although eight of the 19 children with gastritis and nine of the 34 children with normal antral histologic findings had histologic evidence of duodenal inflammation. We conclude that C pyloridis is associated with primary antral gastritis but not with secondary gastritis in the pediatric population.\r"

  ".W": "Experience with more than 375 cases of possible sexual abuse has taught us that much work still needs to be done in understanding normal prepubertal female anatomy and interpreting findings in sexual abuse cases. Because pediatric clinicians are often called upon to assess possible sexual abuse victims, knowledge of what is known and how best to examine the genitalia of a young girl is essential. Two cases are discussed that involve normal and abnormal anatomy. Examination techniques for adequate visualization include proper tension and timing with the spreading of the labia in the supine position, the knee-chest position, and lateral traction on the buttocks while lying flat on the abdomen to look for anal relaxation. The hymen, contrary to common notion, is often a slack, thick, folded, stretchable tissue which may persist after digital or penile penetration. Findings secondary to sexual abuse are often subtle. Acute tears or bruising are rare because force is seldom a part of the sexual acts committed against a child. A vaginal opening of greater than 5 mm is not common and may indicate vaginal penetration with a finger, object, or penis. An \"intact\" hymen does not necessarily preclude vaginal penetration. Lack of physical evidence never rules out abuse because many sexual acts leave no physical findings.\r"

  ".W": "Despite policy statements against routine circumcision of newborns by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology more than 10 years ago, there has been virtually no change in circumcision practices in the United States. In addition, controlled trials of programs to educate parents about the lack of medical indications for routine newborn circumcision have shown that parental education has little impact on the circumcision decision. We hypothesized that parents based their circumcision decision predominantly on social concerns rather than on medical ones. We prospectively surveyed parents of 124 newborns soon after they made the circumcision decision to learn their reasons for the decision. The strongest factor associated with the circumcision decision was whether or not the father was circumcised (P less than .0001). The survey also showed that concerns about the attitudes of peers and their sons' self concept in the future were prominent among parents deciding to circumcise. The circumcision decision in the United States is emerging as a cultural ritual rather than the result of medical misunderstanding among parents. In counseling parents making the circumcision decision, the health care provider should provide a knowledgeable and honest discussion of the medical aspects of circumcision. Until information is available that addresses parents' social concerns about circumcision, it is unreasonable to expect a significant change in circumcision customs in the United States.\r"

There were 134 normal infants (controls), 85 siblings of SIDS victims (siblings), and 39 infants who survived an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) with no cause found for the incident. Mean postnatal ages were between 10 and 16 weeks. Transepidermal water evaporation rate was measured from the forehead using an evaporimeter during one night's polygraphic sleep recording. Measurements were made before feedings, during the first part of the night, and evaporation rate values were expressed as grams per square meter of body surface area per hour. In the three groups of patients evaporation rates were significantly lower during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, compared with values measured during quiet wakefulness or nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Infants with an ALTE had significantly higher evaporation rate values during NREM sleep than the two other groups (20.1 +/- 1.93, 11.3 +/- 0.68, and 11.5 +/- 0.98 for the ALTE, control, and sibling infants, respectively). The differences were not related to age, sex, weight, or rectal temperature. During NREM sleep, evaporation rate values greater than 25 mg/m2/h were seen in 10/190 (5.3%) of the asymptomatic infants and in 11/36 (30.6%) of the infants with an ALTE. The results are in agreement with reports in the literature of repeated night sweating in infants who eventually died of SIDS. Although we are unable to conclude why evaporation rate values are higher in the ALTE group than in the two other groups, we cannot exclude that it reflects differences in autonomous system activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The RBC distribution width of 47 patients with microcytic anemia was then evaluated. RBC distribution width was elevated in 19 of 22 patients with iron deficiency but was also increased in six of 14 patients with thalassemia trait and two of 11 patients with anemia secondary to inflammatory disease. The resulting discrimination was better than that obtained by using Mentzer's index or the discriminant function in the patients studied. The RBC distribution width, albeit a less then perfect tool, can be of value in evaluating pediatric patients with microcytic anemia.\r"

Five patients, 2 to 17 years of age, sought medical attention because of chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, and heme-positive stools. Rectal biopsies, visual inspection of colonic mucosa through the colonoscope, and contrast radiographs of the large and small intestine yielded nonspecific results. Serial endoscopic biopsies demonstrated a gradient of inflammatory changes diminishing in severity distally from the ileocecal valve and cecum. The disease process was most evident in specimens from the cecum, whereas biopsies distal to the transverse colon had a normal histologic appearance in all five patients. Biopsies from the proximal colon may provide evidence of inflammatory bowel disease not detectable using standard techniques. The combination of chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, and heme-positive stools associated with inflammatory changes in biopsy specimens obtained from the proximal colon, but normal findings on radiologic, colonoscopic, and rectal biopsy examinations, may represent an early stage in the evolution of chronic nonspecific inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis or regional enteritis (Crohn disease).\r"

  ".W": "The mortality rates of infants born in Kentucky during 1982 and 1983 were analyzed to determine whether there were differences between poor and nonpoor infants. We used computer matching with the Social Insurance Food Stamp files and with the Aid for Families With Dependent Children files to define poor and nonpoor Kentucky resident families. The crude death rate for poor infants was 13.7/1,000 births, and the nonpoor death rate was 10.8/1,000 births. After adjusting for several important variables, we found that the poor infant was at a significantly greater risk for death than the nonpoor infant but only during the postneonatal period (relative risk 2.04, P = .0003). Some differences by sex and race were noted. Sudden infant death syndrome and infections were largely responsible for the poor infants' higher postneonatal mortality risk.\r"

Foreign bodies most often found in the nose included hair beads, toy parts, paper wads, and food. Approximately 90% of all foreign bodies were able to be removed without significant complications by emergency department personnel with simple equipment. Those who required referral for otorhinolaryngologic intervention had more often failed at self or parental home foreign body removal attempts than those who were able to managed successfully by emergency department personnel.

Guidelines were compared to determine variations in the recommendations for initial patient assessment, choice of anticonvulsant therapy, and instructions for medication administration. There was wide variation in recommendations for patient stabilization procedures and laboratory measurements. Fifteen different sequences of anticonvulsant administration were listed. The initial drug of choice was intravenous diazepam in 81% of the programs, in doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.75 mg/kg. The preference for the second-line anticonvulsant was divided equally between phenytoin and phenobarbital. Phenytoin was not mentioned at all in three (14%) of the protocols, while paraldehyde was included in 14 (66%). Instructions for paraldehyde administration were confusing, imprecise, and occasionally inappropriate. We conclude that there is no well-accepted approach to the management of status epilepticus in pediatric patients. Furthermore, the guidelines in current use frequently are incomplete and probably confusing to residents.\r"

None had a source of infection on physical examination, and all were admitted with the diagnosis of \"rule out sepsis.\" During the month of July, all patients with positive urine culture results had their urine sample collected by bag. In no instance was there a clinical diagnosis of urinary tract infection because of the presence of contaminant bacteria. A program was instituted on August 1, 1984 which encouraged the utilization of either bladder catheterization or suprapubic aspiration techniques, and discouraged bag collection technique for culturing urine. Over the next four months, catheterization and suprapubic aspiration techniques increased from 0 to 72%; bag technique decreased from 100 to 27%. Also, during this period the incidence of urinary tract infection increased to 5.53%. Seventy-five percent of patients with urinary tract infection had an initial urinalysis with less than 5 to 10 white blood cells/HPF, and 60% had an initial urine specific gravity of less than or equal to 1.005. Eighty-seven percent of infants with a positive urine culture result collected by bag technique revealed a mixture of more than three organisms. The technique utilized for collecting urine for culture in infants has a major impact on the incidence of urinary tract infection. The absence of pyuria is not a reliable indicator of the absence of urinary tract infection. Infants with urinary tract infection may have a transient loss in urine concentrating ability early in the course of their infection.\r"

  ".W": "Meningitis should be suspected in a patient who presents with fever, meningism, or severe headache. A careful physical examination should be performed of perimeningeal foci, with emphasis on the sinuses, ears, throat, neck, and lungs. A history of exposure to tuberculosis, viral disease, rodents, or suspicious dairy products or farm animals may give clues to the source of the meningitis. Immunosuppression through the use of corticosteroids or chemotherapy for such conditions as Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma, leukemia, malnutrition, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) should also be noted and alert the clinician to the possible presence of an unusual pathogen. Meningitis associated with leukemia or most of the non-T-cell lymphomas is likely to be from a common bacterial agent (often Listeria), unless the patient is being treated with a steroid or is receiving other chemotherapy. Patients with Hodgkin's disease or AIDS or who have been treated with a steroid are more likely to have cryptococcal or tuberculous meningitis. Neonates and the very elderly may present with only irritability or lethargy and fever, without any of the other common symptoms. In neonates up to one week of age, group B streptococcal infection should be suspected. Gram-negative organisms should be suspected in elderly patients and those who have had neurosurgery. In patients with CSF shunts, infection with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus should be assumed and these patients are treated empirically until results of cultures are received. Several noninfectious conditions may mimic infectious meningitis, as may some unusual causes of infectious meningitis (eg, syphilis and schistosomiasis), which have not been discussed in this article.\r"

This decline has resulted directly from a program of prevention that is based on a detailed understanding of iron lack in infants and children. However, iron deficiency without anemia--subtle iron deficiency--remains a problem. The negative impact of iron deficiency on brain function has recently been demonstrated in animal as well as human studies. The behavioral effects noted in infants and toddlers can be seen with subtle iron deficiency as well as with anemia. Although behavioral abnormalities in the very young appear to be correctable by iron treatment, prolonged iron deficiency may lead to irreversible effects on brain function. These recent findings should further encourage continued vigilance in preventing the old problem of iron deficiency.\r"

The subjects were three children with severe multiple handicaps whose mean age was 2 years 4 months and whose conditions included seizures and muscle tone disorders. Frequency of head lifts and cumulative duration of head-erect behavior were recorded during three-minute sessions with the subjects positioned prone on their forearms over a wedge. After baseline observations were recorded, vibration was applied to the paraspinal muscles of the neck and upper back for the first two minutes of each intervention session. In addition, electromyographic activity was recorded for a three-minute session at least once during both the baseline and intervention conditions. Results of the study demonstrated an increase in the cumulative duration of head-erect behavior for the three subjects and an accompanying increase in EMG activity during muscle vibration. The diversity of handicapping conditions (ie, seizures, hypertonia, and hypotonia) appeared to have no effect on the benefits received from muscle vibration for these subjects. Limitations of the study and implications for future research are discussed.\r"

Thirty healthy women were tested using an isokinetic dynamometer at velocities of 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 120 degrees, and 210 degrees/sec. Reliability was assessed in 20 of the subjects by retesting concentric and eccentric torques at 30 degrees and 120 degrees/sec after a 30-minute rest interval. The highest torque from three maximal efforts was considered to be peak torque. Mean eccentric peak torque was greater than either isometric or concentric peak torque; as isokinetic test velocity increased, the differences between concentric and eccentric torques became larger. Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from .72 to .83, indicating lack of consistency between test and retest torques. Consecutive concentric-eccentric testing and lack of mechanical stabilization might have contributed to test-retest variability and to the relatively small differences between concentric and eccentric torques. Continued study of reliability of isokinetic testing protocols and further investigation of concentric-eccentric torque-velocity relationships are advocated.\r"

In each seating position, the subject performed an upper extremity activity on cue. The tests were repeated in reverse sequence. Mean performance times were different at all seating orientations for both types of subjects. Performance time was lowest at the 0-degree orientation during the retest for the subjects with spasticity and highest at 15-degree anterior inclination during the retest for the subjects with athetosis. The results of this study show that orientation of the body in space affects upper extremity function and emphasizes the importance of positioning for maximizing upper extremity function.\r"

Training consisted of multisensory (auditory, tactile, visual, and kinesthetic) cuing focused on the lower abdominal muscles during the slow curl-back (eccentric) phase of curl-up exercises with the subjects' feet unsupported. We recorded integrated electromyographic (IEMG) values using surface electrodes from internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles during pretest and posttest exercises. Using an analysis of covariance, posttest IEMG values of the Experimental Group were significantly higher (p less than .001) than the Control Group. Our results reveal that multisensory cuing with the feet unsupported during the curl-back is an effective method of increasing combined recruitment of internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. Motor skills developed by this technique are discussed in relation to optimal trunk function and rehabilitation.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the relative decreases in KET at velocities greater than 30 degrees/sec were different on the two sides. To further investigate this relative decrease, the relationship between the torque at 30 degrees/sec and those at higher speeds also was examined on each side. Relative decreases in KET differed between speeds, but not between sides. Torques at speeds greater than 30 degrees/sec were correlated significantly with the torque at 30 degrees/sec. These findings suggest that patients with hemiparesis and minimal muscle spasticity may have difficulty moving forcefully at higher speeds because they are weak. Therapeutic interventions, therefore, might be most beneficial when they are directed toward helping patients with hemiparesis activate their weak muscles.\r"

Among the 2,192 boys and 2,478 girls examined, we noted a total of 10,551 postural deviations. Eighteen categories of deviations of the musculoskeletal system were examined visually. Lordosis was the most common postural deviation seen (45%), and torticollis was noted least commonly (0%). Scoliosis was noted in 7% of the total population, with a girl-boy ratio of 2:1. Both the lack of body postural awareness we observed among the children and the significant findings of this study should warrant initiation of more responsible educational programs in the public schools. An apparent need for a uniform statewide screening program was demonstrated.\r"

Failure of a health care provider to protect a patient's right of informed consent might result in a lawsuit alleging that serious harm was sustained needlessly because the patient plaintiff was not informed of certain significant risks of or consequences that resulted from treatment. As a professional group that puts patients at risk of harm during treatment, physical therapists need to know about their legal duty to facilitate a patient's awareness of and consent to treatment. This article discusses the nature of that duty and how a patient plaintiff might try to prove negligence against a physical therapist who allegedly fails to secure a valid statement of informed consent. The article also provides recommendations so that physical therapists might protect themselves from malpractice suits alleging \"uninformed\" consent.\r"

A computerized mathematical simulation of motion of the lumbar spine under three conditions was performed, representing variations on the physiologic motion of the lumbar spine. The instantaneous center of rotation of the T12 vertebral body moving about a fixed pelvis was calculated and displayed. Under normal conditions, the center of rotation started close to the center of the L3 vertebral body and moved in an arc similar to that of L3 during flexion and extension. Dynamic testing of the trunk musculature in the lumbar region, therefore, should be performed with the axis of the isokinetic dynamometer aligned with the L3 vertebral body, and motion of the pelvis and thoracic spine should be minimized. This position of the axis provides the best approximation of the fixed axis of the testing machine to the physiologic axis. Failure to observe these precautions would tend to make the motion of the lumbar spine nonisokinetic and, thus, interfere with angular measurement of the spinal motion.\r"

Six hundred seventy-four CT scans were correlated with 138 lymphangiograms and 840 follow-up KUB (kidney, ureter, bladder) radiographs. In 21 patients there was evidence of relapse, and in 105 the disease had regressed or remained stable. In all patients with evidence of progression or regression on the CT scan, there was a concomitant change in opacified lymph nodes on the KUB radiographs. It is recommended that the initial staging of lymphoma be done with lymphangiography and CT. If the findings of both are positive, then follow-up should consist of only KUB radiography. If progression is detected, restaging with CT may also be performed. This approach will not only reduce the radiation dose but will also save time and money and enable a more efficient use of radiologic equipment.\r"

  ".W": "Serial dynamic upper abdominal computed tomography (CT) studies were performed on 20 patients as part of the conservative treatment of blunt hepatic injuries (hematoma, laceration, or fracture). Fourteen of these patients had either major or minor associated hemoperitoneum. In 13 patients, hemoperitoneum was either significantly reduced or absent by 1 week. A severe delayed hemorrhage occurred in one patient 7 1/2 days after admission; a large and unchanged volume of intraperitoneal fluid had been seen on a preceding abdominal CT scan. One other patient who had a satisfactory response underwent surgery for a pancreatic laceration. Serial abdominal CT studies are an integral part of the conservative treatment of blunt hepatic injuries and seem to be useful in monitoring resorption of hemoperitoneum and the pattern of healing of intrahepatic hematomas, lacerations, and fractures.\r"

  ".W": "To overcome the problem of inadequate mixing of gastrointestinal (GI) tract contents with conventional high-density oral contrast agents in abdominal computed tomography (CT), a flavored 12.5% corn oil emulsion (COE) was tested as an oral contrast agent in 62 patients. The results were compared with those obtained from 105 patients who received high-density oral contrast agents. A simple patient preparation regimen for the COE was developed, which appears to be reasonably well tolerated by the patients and yields diagnostic studies comparable to those obtained with conventional agents. Use of the COE resulted in consistent discrimination of the GI tract and depiction of the GI wall. Preliminary data suggest that it may be particularly useful for CT evaluation of the stomach, duodenum, and pancreas; in patients suspected of having solid tumors; and in thin people.\r"

  ".W": "The perirenal spaces may communicate across the midline, anterior to the lower aorta and vena cava. The connecting channel has a relatively narrow anteroposterior dimension on computed tomographic (CT) scans, both in vivo and in injected cadavers. It may therefore be difficult to visualize on abdominal radiographs and may be mistaken for unopacified bowel on CT scans. The midline extension of perirenal fluid is usually contiguous to the lower abdominal great vessels anteriorly but does not surround them completely, possibly because of fibrous septa within the perivascular fat. Hematomas from ruptured aortic aneurysms extend mainly into the perirenal spaces. Thus, the lower abdominal great vessels are located, in effect, within the midline extension of these spaces. Superiorly, the perirenal spaces extend to the diaphragm, abutting the lateral and anterior margins of the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles and the bare area of the liver. Inferiorly, perirenal collections appear to diverge into the pelvis, along the psoas muscles, ureters, and iliac vessels.\r"

  ".W": "For many years, atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions have been described by angiographers only in terms of location and degree of narrowing. However, it has become apparent that coronary stenoses generally have distinct morphologic features that can be recognized at angiography and that allow them to be classified as either \"simple\" or \"complex\" plaques. Complex plaques are those characterized by ulcerated or ruptured surfaces, subintimal hemorrhage, superimposed partially occluding thrombi, recanalized thrombi, or some combination. Pathologic studies have shown a very high frequency of these lesions at sites of total thrombotic occlusion of coronary arteries. Clinical and angiographic studies have demonstrated a high frequency of such lesions in living patients with both unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. The presence of complex stenoses has also been found to increase the risk of future myocardial infarction. Plaque morphology thus appears to significantly affect the prognosis of patients with coronary disease and should be carefully evaluated in interpretation of all coronary angiograms.\r"

Bronchial arteries were embolized in all but one patient. In nine patients (45%) nonbronchial systemic collateral arteries contributed significantly to areas of pathologic pulmonary tissue and frequently were the major arterial supply. These nonbronchial systemic collaterals included branches of the subclavian and axillary arteries (n = 7), intercostal arteries (n = 5), and phrenic arteries (n = 3) and accounted for 59.5% of the total number of arteries embolized. Recognition and occlusion of nonbronchial systemic collaterals providing blood to hypervascular pulmonary lesions is essential for successful percutaneous embolotherapy of hemoptysis.\r"

Twenty-two lesions were in patients with polytetrafluoroethylene graft fistulas, five were in patients with bovine carotid fistulas, and three were in patients with endogenous arteriovenous fistulas. There were 28 venous stenoses (20 at the anastomotic site and eight more proximally) and two arterial stenoses. The overall success rate was 80%, with a 6-month patency of 76% and a mean patency after PTA of 9.4 months. Among the venous lesions, the success was 100% for proximal lesions and 71% for anastomotic lesions. There were two technical failures, which required surgery for revision of the fistulas, and four self-limited hematomas. PTA is a safe and effective treatment for stenoses in dialysis fistulas, particularly for lesions remote from the anastomotic sites.\r"

The diameters of the additional balloon varied from 10 to 20 mm. Balloons were inflated manually at about 30-45 psi (206.7-310.1 kPa) and deflated immediately after disappearance of the balloon waist. The mean peak systolic pressure gradient was 85 mm Hg +/- 37 before valvuloplasty, and it decreased to 38 mm Hg +/- 28 afterward (P less than .05). Double-balloon dilation and simultaneous computed tomography were done in two cardiac specimens from adult cadavers. At inflations at 30 and 45 psi (206.7 and 310.1 kPa), the outflow tract was elongated, and the balloons also deformed into ovoid shape at the lower pressure. The double-balloon technique appears to be safe and effective for relief of pulmonary valvular stenosis in those cases in which single-balloon technique is inadequate, especially in older children and adults.\r"

  ".W": "Transient bilateral sensory and motor symptoms after trauma, including complete paralysis, have been identified in patients with cervical spinal stenosis. Radiographs of 23 patient athletes with cervical spinal neurapraxia were used for measurement of the cervical spinal canal. Two methods of measurement were used. In the conventional method, sagittal diameter is measured from the posterior surface of the vertebral body to the nearest point of the corresponding laminar line. In the ratio method, the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal is divided by the sagittal diameter of the corresponding vertebral body. Results indicate the ratio method is reliable for determining cervical spinal stenosis and is independent of technical factor variables.\r"

The progression of the radiologic manifestations in 13 patients who were followed up from 1 to 32 years and the computed tomography (CT) scans from five patients were obtained. The progression of PDD was slow and unpredictable, from minimal endosteal thickening of the mid-diaphyses in one pair of long bones to severe sclerosis of long bones, skull, and vertebrae. The severity of the osseous changes was not age dependent. A six-stage system was used to grade the severity of involvement and progression of PDD. CT scans demonstrated muscle mass that was preserved and showed the distribution of the osteosclerotic process, which was irregular and inhomogeneous. CT scanning was advantageous over plain radiography in this respect. Endosteal involvement was more extensive than periosteal thickening. CT scans also showed a distinct pattern of vertebral sclerosis that was confined to the posterior areas of the vertebral body and arches. In light of the paucity of characteristic clinical signs of PDD, the recognition of the radiologic features is mandatory for the diagnosis of this disease.\r"

Forty-six patients with malignant tumors of the nasopharynx and related spaces affecting the skull base underwent MR imaging. MR images were obtained with a 0.3-T permanent-magnet imaging system in axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. MR findings were compared with clinical records, plain radiographs, CT scans, and pathologic correlates when available. MR imaging could demonstrate neoplastic invasion of the bone of the floor of the middle cranial fossa and the vital soft-tissue structures related to it as well as or better than CT. Tumor extension was viewed directly as a continuous mass or indirectly by marrow replacement or displacement of normal structures. Specific anatomic routes through which tumors extend from the nasopharynx to the middle cranial fossa were inferred from MR findings.\r"

Detailed analysis of the contour of the neoplasm combined with clinical findings allowed further refinement of the differential diagnosis in each category. Most lesions had an intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a fairly high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Hypervascular tumors had a number of \"channel voids\" caused by high-flow vessels on T1- and T2-weighted images, and on T2-weighted images there were areas of high signal intensity, presumably due to sites of slow flow within the image plane. The hypovascular lesions were quite homogeneous, and it was therefore more difficult to differentiate among the neoplasms in this group.\r"

Three types of MR signal patterns were seen in association with cord injuries. Acute intraspinal hemorrhage was seen in five patients with cord injuries and demonstrated decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted images obtained within 24 hours of injury. Cord edema and contusion had high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and were observed in 12 cases with cord injury. Neurologic recovery, determined in 16 patients, was insignificant in patients with intraspinal hemorrhage; however, patients with cord edema or contusion recovered significant neurologic function. MR at 1.5 T is extremely useful in the diagnosis of acute cord injury and also demonstrates potential in predicting neurologic recovery.\r"

Patients underwent imaging preoperatively, immediately postoperatively (1-10 days), and late postoperatively (2-6 months). A retrospective review of MR images obtained in 62 patients who had undergone lumbar surgery but still had low back pain was also conducted. Epidural soft-tissue change and mass effect mimicking preoperative findings were present in nine of 13 patients who underwent laminectomy and diskectomy. Mass effect improved in appearance by the late postoperative period in eight of nine patients. T2-weighted sagittal images were best in demonstrating the site of anulus disruption immediately after diskectomy, which was seen in 11 of 13 patients, and the rent resolved on the late images in eight of ten cases. Sites of foraminotomy were seen as a loss of the normal foraminal fat signal. Extensive soft-tissue changes present in the immediate postoperative period severely limit the usefulness of MR imaging in that period for evaluating persistent symptoms. The exception may be hemorrhage, as its distinctive signal on T1-weighted images makes its identification possible.\r"

MR imaging precisely located the VP in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus, and Schmorl nodes. In all but one case, degeneration of the disk was complete and associated with adjacent changes in vertebral bone. Pitfalls of MR imaging detection of VP included chemical shift artifact, calcifications, and tears without gas in the disk.\r"

Results show that radiologists who regularly conduct knee arthrography examinations can incur doses to the gonads that are less than 6% of the U.S. limits, and to the thyroid and eye that are approximately 10% of the U.S. limits. Since the scatter radiation from overhead imaging of stress views constituted most (greater than or equal to 60%) of the dose to the lens of the eye and the thyroid, spot imaging was evaluated as a substitute for overhead imaging in the assessment of the anterior cruciate ligament. This substitution resulted in no loss of clinical information and has now completely replaced overhead imaging of stress views at this institution.\r"

The 5-year survival of the total group of patients was 30%. Patients with lesions classified as stage 1 and stage 2 had the best prognosis, with a 5- and 10-year survival of 43.5% and 27%, respectively. In patients classified as stage 3 and stage 4, the 5- and 10-year survival was 20%. A postoperative measurement of regional ventilation and perfusion indicated that the function of the remaining lung was presumably undisturbed by the operation. Also, the vital capacity and FEV 1 were only minimally reduced as a result of the operation. The amount of functional lung tissue spared by the operation compared to pneumonectomy was estimated to 39%. Because of these functional results and the promising 5-year survival figures, we suggest that sleeve lobectomy should be the operation of choice for tumors localized to the upper lobe orifice involving the main bronchus.\r"

After obtaining 25 degrees C hypothermia the bypass was discontinued and the cerebral vessels were cannulated from inside of the opened aneurysm and perfused at a flow rate of 250 ml/min. The myocardium was protected by cold cardioplegia and topical cooling. During total circulatory arrest the distal aortic arch anastomoses were completed in 28-56 minutes. Then the by-pass was restarted and the rest of the operation was carried out as usual. One patient with an acute dissecting aortic aneurysm died on the 2 post-operative day due to brain damage and rupture of abdominal aorta. The other patients recovered well. There were no permanent neurological or myocardial complications. Three patients had a transient renal failure, one needing dialysis. The 8 survivors have done well 4-46 months after the operation.\r"

The aneurysm had ruptured in three cases. The patients' mean age was 69 years. Anesthesia and muscle relaxation were obtained by drugs with only minor myocardial depressant action. There was no postoperative mortality or morbidity. Five of the patients have been followed up for at least a year. Careful pharmacologic control of the blood pressure is essential during such surgery. Despite the smallness of the series, it indicates that simple cross-clamping and Dacron graft interposition can be used for treatment of aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta.\r"

An interventricular patch was fashioned to reconstruct the interventricular septum and the atrioventricular valves. The patch had two distinct components, one superior or atrial and the other inferior or ventricular. The division was made by inserting a lateral support at different levels on either face of the patch, to which the anterior and posterior atrioventricular cusps were sutured. The interatrial defect was closed with a patch that, together with the atrial component of the interventricular patch, produced a foramen ovale type closure mechanism. The authors present the pathologic observations which served as a basis for development of the surgical technique.\r"

Echocardiographic parameters showed no significant improvement in left ventricular function. The NYHA classification was I or II in 85% of the patients at follow-up, but in only 23% preoperatively. Preoperative EF greater than or equal to 0.30 was associated with 76% +/- 16 (SE) cumulative 5-year survival as compared with 31% +/- 12 when EF had been less than 0.30.

The 12 emergency operations were necessitated by major complications during or after PTCA, viz, coronary occlusion (6 patients) coronary dissection (2) and failed catheter passage or dilation with severe myocardial ischemia (4). Three of these 12 patients had signs of acute myocardial infarction preoperatively, and new infarction appeared postoperatively in two cases. All eight patients with ST-segment elevation preoperatively had raised levels of myocardial enzymes postoperatively, and two of them had new Q-waves. Three of the 12 patients required inotropic drugs following revascularization. There was one postoperative death. When complications arise in PTCA, emergency operation should be undertaken. When PTCA fails, but without complications, surgery can be electively performed.\r"

In five other dogs the coronary vessel was occluded for 480 min, and five dogs underwent the same operative procedure but without occlusion of the artery. The serum CK was monitored for 8 hours postoperatively in all dogs. Elevation of the CK levels occurred in all groups, but the area under the time-enzyme activity curve showed no statistically significant difference between the group with 480-min occlusion, in which transmural myocardial infarction occurred in all dogs, and the group with temporary occlusion, in which no infarction could be histologically or histochemically demonstrated. Contrastingly, a statistically significant difference was found between the group with temporary occlusion and the control group with no occlusion. The results suggest that CK elevation is of no value as an indicator of irreversible myocardial damage during heart surgery that involves temporary myocardial ischaemia.\r"

Of the remaining 39 patients, 11 had recurrence of pneumothorax after a median of 11 (range 2-64) weeks. Repeat thoracoscopy then showed large cyst or bullous emphysema in seven cases. Tetracycline pleurodesis was again performed in the others. In continued observation for at least 2 years there were no further recurrences. The importance of meticulous thoracoscopy is stressed. The demonstrated diagnostic errors do not detract from the value of tetracycline pleurodesis when spontaneous pneumothorax is caused by rupture of only tiny blebs on the surface of an otherwise healthy lung. The procedure is fast, simple and efficacious.\r"

Cells that divide between approximately 1 1/2 hours before and approximately 40 minutes after the differentiation-inducing starvation become prestalk, whereas cells dividing at other times become prespore cells. These results suggest mechanisms by which an initial proportioning of the two cell types within the aggregate is achieved.\r"

Although taurine is present in millimolar concentrations in the myocardium of all mammals, taurine depletion has not previously been associated with a decrease in myocardial function in any species. In this study, low plasma taurine concentrations associated with echocardiographic evidence of myocardial failure were observed in 21 cats fed commercial cat foods and in 2 of 11 cats fed a purified diet containing marginally low concentrations of taurine for 4 years. Oral supplementation of taurine resulted in increased plasma taurine concentrations and was associated with normalization of left ventricular function in both groups of cats. Since myocardial concentrations of taurine are directly related to plasma concentrations and low plasma concentrations were found to be associated with myocardial failure in cats, a direct link between decreased taurine concentration in the myocardium and decreased myocardial mechanical function is proposed.\r"

In mimicking this scenario in the laboratory, uninfected vectors were found to acquire virus while cofeeding on the same host as infected vectors. However, the vertebrate host on which they fed did not develop detectable levels of virus in its blood. These observations were made with Thogoto virus, an influenza-like virus of medical and veterinary significance. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks were used as the vector and guinea pigs as the vertebrate host. The results demonstrate that a vertebrate that is apparently refractory to infection by an arthropod-borne virus can still play an important role in the epidemiology of the virus, and they suggest a novel mode of arthropod-borne virus transmission.\r"

We report here the isolation of full-length complementary DNA clones of a putative hypercalcemia factor, and the expression from the cloned DNA of the active protein in mammalian cells. The clones encode a prepro peptide of 36 amino acids and a mature protein of 141 amino acids that has significant homology with parathyroid hormone in the amino-terminal region. This previously unrecognized hormone may be important in normal as well as abnormal calcium metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "87292120\r", 
  ".W": "Local increases in neuronal activity within the brain lead to dilation of blood vessels and to increased regional cerebral blood flow. Increases in extracellular potassium concentration are known to dilate cerebral arterioles. Recent studies have suggested that the potassium released by active neurons is transported through astrocytic glial cells and released from their endfeet onto blood vessels. The results of computer simulations of potassium dynamics in the brain indicate that the release of potassium from astrocyte endfeet raises perivascular potassium concentration much more rapidly and to higher levels than does diffusion of potassium through extracellular space, particularly when the site of a potassium increase is some distance from the vessel wall. On the basis of this finding, it is proposed that the release of potassium from astrocyte endfeet plays an important role in regulating regional cerebral blood flow in response to changes in neuronal activity.\r"

  ".W": "In some instances, insertion of maize transposable elements into exons does not result in the total loss of enzymatic activity. In other instances, messenger RNAs of wild-type size are encoded by genes known to contain the maize transposable element Dissociation (Ds) in exons. To understand how Ds is processed from RNA, a study was made of transcripts encoded by two alleles of the maize waxy (wx) gene containing Ds insertions in exon sequences. The analysis was carried out in strains where the Ds element could not excise from the wx gene. Despite insertions of 4.3- and 1.5-Ds elements, the predominant transcripts encoded by these two genes were wild type in size. For both alleles, DNA sequencing of complementary DNAs revealed that the Ds elements had been spliced in a similar manner. Splicing was accomplished by the utilization of multiple 5' donor splice sites in the Ds termini and a 3' acceptor site within the wx gene adjacent to the Ds element. The net effect in both cases was the removal of most of the Ds element from the messenger RNA.\r"

Two molecules of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) bind to symmetry related sites at the subunit interface of the phosphorylase dimer. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds to the same site, but does not promote catalytic activity. The structure of glucose-inhibited phosphorylase a bound to AMP and also of the complex formed with glucose and ATP is described. Crystallographic refinement of these complexes reveals that structural changes are associated with AMP but not ATP binding. The origin of these effects can be traced to different effector binding modes exhibited by AMP and ATP, respectively. The conformational changes associated with AMP binding traverse multiple paths in the enzyme and link the effector and catalytic sites.\r"

  ".W": "The discovery of the first definitively correlated earliest Jurassic (200 million years before present) tetrapod assemblage (Fundy basin, Newark Supergroup, Nova Scotia) allows reevaluation of the duration of the Triassic-Jurassic tetrapod extinction event. Present are tritheledont and mammal-like reptiles, prosauropod, theropod, and ornithischian dinosaurs, protosuchian and sphenosuchian crocodylomorphs, sphenodontids, and hybodont, semionotid, and palaeonisciform fishes. All of the families are known from Late Triassic and Jurassic strata from elsewhere; however, pollen and spore, radiometric, and geochemical correlation indicate an early Hettangian age for these assemblages. Because all \"typical Triassic\" forms are absent from these assemblages, most Triassic-Jurassic tetrapod extinctions occurred before this time and without the introduction of new families. As was previously suggested by studies of marine invertebrates, this pattern is consistent with a global extinction event at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. The Manicouagan impact structure of Quebec provides dates broadly compatible with the Triassic-Jurassic boundary and, following the impact theory of mass extinctions, may be implicated in the cause.\r"

Embryonic thymus epithelium from donor quail (before it had been colonized by hemopoietic cells) was grafted into chicks. A chimeric thymic epithelial stroma was generated in which the lymphocytes of the chick acquired the capacity to recognize the grafted limb as self either permanently or for a protracted period of time. In such thymic chimeras the grafted wings were not rejected.\r"

A high incidence (six out of six) of raf sequences was found in transfected NIH/3T3 clones and the tumorigenic potential of SQ-20B DNA could be linked to genomic fragments that represent most of the kinase domain of human c-raf-1. An apparently unaltered 3.5-kilobase pair (kb) human c-raf transcript was identified in SQ-20B cells but was not observed in the transfected NIH/3T3 cell clones. Two new transcripts (4.2 kb and 2.6 kb) were found in tumorigenic clones; the large transcript was missing in a very poorly tumorigenic clone. Cytogenetic analysis indicated that the normal autosomes of chromosome 3 were absent in SQ-20B karyotypes and had formed apparently stable marker chromosomes. Unlike the recipient NIH/3T3 cell line, 30 percent of the transformed clone-1 metaphases had minute and double-minute chromosomes representative of amplified DNA sequences. The frequency of the c-raf-1 identification by NIH/3T3 transfection of SQ-20B DNA suggests the presence of some genetic abnormality within this locus.\r"

This difficulty and the recurrent phenomenon of the misplaced physician have prompted a search for better selection criteria and more efficient evaluation systems. The literature does not provide a concise description of the ideal resident candidate, but it does contain several approaches taken by a few individual teaching centers to improve applicant review procedures. Computer-assisted resident candidate selection (CARCS) is a three-phase system of preinterview screening, interview evaluation, and final ranking. Based on faculty criteria, the entire process uses data management technology that provides automatic calculation of selection parameters, sorting on any data field or combination thereof, and maintenance of a concise information profile for each candidate. CARCS allows equitable consideration of all who apply, with significant cost savings to both program and applicants. This paper reviews traditional methods of selecting anesthesiology residents, describes the CARCS system, and previews the future of resident candidate selection.\r"

We investigated these high rates by examining incidence of colorectal cancer in one county with a high mortality. The objective was to determine whether the incidence of colorectal cancer was as high as mortality rates indicated and, if so, to look for possible etiologic factors for the high rates. We found the incidence of colon cancer to be significantly higher in Campbell County than expected. While we expected 162 cases of colon cancer, we actually observed 192 (P less than .01). The number of rectal cancers was no higher than expected (52 expected and 62 observed), in agreement with previously reported mortality figures. A geographic plot of cases by home residence showed a significantly higher rate of colon cancer for urban county regions than for rural regions. In fact, the population of rural Campbell County had a colon cancer rate significantly lower than either the county rate or the national rate. Several factors were analyzed to explain these rate differences. The only consistently associated factor was source of residential drinking water.\r"

The purpose of this review was to correlate preoperative findings with postoperative results to define more precisely the indications and contraindications and to improve results. Between 1970 and 1983, 72 high tibial osteotomies for osteoarthritis were done at Duke University Medical Center by one surgeon using a consistent surgical technique. Fourteen complications were identified in 72 knees. The only one causing a persistent problem was a fracture of the tibial plateau. Forty-five knees in 38 patients were available for follow-up at an average of six years (range 1.5 to 15.0 years). Results in 15 knees (33%) were classified as \"good\" (pain free), in 20 knees (44%) as \"fair\" (improved), and in ten knees (22%) as \"poor\" (unchanged or worse). Three patients with fair results subsequently had total knee arthroplasty at least nine years after the osteotomy, and two of those with poor results received total knee replacement within two years of the tibial osteotomy. Measurements obtained from standing roentgenograms revealed an average of 3 degrees of preoperative varus and 8 degrees of postoperative valgus, for an average correction of 11 degrees. There was no statistically significant correlation between preoperative measurements of joint space or alignment and postoperative result. This review indicates that preoperative standing films of the knee alone are not a reliable indication for patient selection.\r"

Major and minor complications were comparable in the two groups except that urinary tract infection was statistically more common in the cesarean hysterectomy group. The mean hospital stay for the two groups was comparable. The estimated blood loss and transfusion rate were higher in the cesarean hysterectomy group. The transfusion rate was probably artificially increased because of overzealous intraoperative transfusion. Elective cesarean hysterectomy does not cause unacceptably high morbidity, and it is an acceptable alternative to interval vaginal hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in poorly compliant patients.\r"

Recent advances in the clinical understanding of human sexual functioning have not been accompanied by an effort to refine our thinking about its relationship to kleptomania. Research is hampered by the relative rarity of the disorder and the propensity of patients to avoid seeking professional help. Consequently, the available literature is restricted to case studies or small series that fail to differentiate between kleptomania and other forms of shoplifting. This paper describes the six patients I have seen with the primary diagnosis of kleptomania; all had dysfunctional sexual relationships. The sole male patient was a homosexual, and compulsively promiscuous. Sexual counseling and/or therapy may provide an additional method for treating this difficult disorder.\r"

These calcified vesicles and bodies were also encountered in the wide mineralized areas among the collagen and elastic fibers in the ligament. The mineralization process of the calcified nodules in the ligamentum flavum implies that matrix vesicles and matrix giant bodies acquire mineralized precipitates; then some gather in clusters. Calcified deposits may spread to collagen and elastic fibers contiguous with the calcified vesicles and bodies, and some eventually coalesce to make a calcified nodule.\r"

Although the method can be used in any case of traumatic instability of the cervical spine, the main indications are teardrop fractures not reduced by skull traction, severe wedging fractures, severe extension injuries, and any lesion with compression in the anterior part of the canal. Old kyphotic blocks or unreduced fracture-dislocations, with anterior bone and fibrous callus, can be treated with this method better than with any other technique.

We propose, that by sequential stimulation of the median and posterior tibial nerves, and the construction of a ratio from the value of their amplitudes, the systemic effects can be eliminated and thus improve the reliability of the cortical evoked responses. Two groups of scoliosis patients who underwent spinal surgery with instrumentation were analyzed retrospectively. Both groups had spinal cord monitoring using peripheral nerve stimulation and cortical recordings of the somatosensory-evoked response (SER). In Group I, 50 patients were analyzed for changes in posterior tibial nerve response before and after distraction. Wide variability in the response suggested this method to be less reliable in predicting spinal cord conduction deficits. Thirty-eight patients in Group 2 were analyzed using both the median and posterior tibial nerve amplitudes. A ratio of the posterior tibial to median nerve wave amplitude was constructed, thus eliminating any systemic variables. A critical value, alerting the surgeons to possible decreases in spinal cord conduction, was calculated by subtracting one standard deviation from the mean of the postdistraction ratios of the posterior tibial to median nerves (1.20-.633 = .567).\r"

First, an anterior spinal release and fusion is performed and is followed 7-10 days later by a posterior spinal fusion with double L-rod instrumentation. L-rod instrumentation has the advantage that no postoperative immobilization is necessary, which allows the patient to return to a relatively normal life-style in the immediate postoperative period. Excellent maintenance of correction of the deformity in these patients has occurred with no serious complication to date in 24 patients followed from 19 months to 4 years although \"transient hyperesthesia\" occurred in 16% of patients. A longer follow-up will be necessary to evaluate fully possible late pseudarthrosis and instrumentation failure in this group of patients.\r"

Using computerized regression analysis, these and other variables such as age, Cobb angle, and grafting technique were studied. Rib regeneration correlated with spinal fusion but not with age or Cobb angle. A better host response with strip vs. morseled graft was suggested, but not statistically proven. The data strongly support the belief that systemic biologic factors are a major variable affecting the quality of the fusion procedure.\r"

Also, a biomechanical model of motion of the lumbar spine was used to predict the changes in the back surface as a function of varying amount of flexion and extension at the intervertebral articulations. Surface measurements provided reasonably accurate (+/- 11.2 degrees or +/- 25.5%) measurement of the total lumbar motion with a correlation coefficient of 0.58 between surface and radiographic measures. However, there was a poor correlation (varying between -.08 and .54 at different levels) between segmental motion measured radiographically and at the surface. Detection of the most mobile and least mobile intervertebral levels was done successfully by the surface curvature method in no more cases than would be expected by chance. Measurements of intersegmental motion are inherently error prone since they involve calculating differences between small angles which in turn are difficult to measure accurately. Surface measurements based on changes in back curvature are further complicated since the back surface has a variable relationship with spine shape and accurate measurement of curvature is very difficult.\r"

Maximum and minimum pedicle dimensions indicated that the pedicles are less symmetric cephalad than they are caudal. Vertebral body height increases caudally except posteriorly where, after an initial increase, it decreases in the lower lumbar region. Major and minor body diameters and the major spinal canal diameter slightly increase caudally, whereas minor spinal canal diameter exhibits little or no change.\r"

The percentage of Caucasians was statistically higher in the back pain group. The percentage of Hispanics was statistically higher in the no pain group. Among the variables that were compared in both groups were the age, the weight gained by the mothers during pregnancy, the baby's weight, the number of previous pregnancies, number of prior children. None of the variables reached a statistically significant level. The pain group complained of pain the low-back area, which radiated in 45.5% of cases to the lower extremities. In about one-third of the patients the pain increased as the day wore on, whereas in another one-third the pain increased during the night and disturbed sleep. Standing, sitting, forward bending, lifting, and walking tended to increase the pain. Most of the patients started suffering from back pain between the fifth and seventh months of pregnancy. Several theories to explain the occurrence of backache during pregnancy are discussed.\r"

The method is based upon a psychophysical model referred to as acceptable maximum effort (AME). AME is the highest level of voluntary effort that a person can achieve without inducing unacceptable pain. In the current study, the AME method was applied to strength measurement. By use of a static strength measurement procedure, arm, leg, shoulder, back, and composite strengths were assessed upon admission to and discharge from a 4-week, nonsurgical comprehensive pain treatment program. The reliability of the AME method for each strength measure was assessed. In addition, the method was used to evaluate pre- to post-treatment changes in strength. Results indicate the AME method to be highly reliable and useful in determining treatment outcome. Reliability coefficients for all strength measures were above .90. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for standardized functional ability measurement in the area of chronic pain.\r"

The specific dermatome to be monitored intraoperatively was selected by correlating those data with physical and radiographic findings and, in certain cases, the results of selective nerve root blocks. Intraoperative baseline (predecompression) DSEP values were obtained after positioning the patient on the operative frame. Monitoring was performed during surgery and post-decompression values were obtained after neural decompression. For six cases of unilateral nerve root decompression, an average 9-msec decrease in latency was noted on the operated side and a 3-msec decrease on the nonoperated side. For 24 cases of bilateral decompression, an average 8-9-msec decrease in latency was noted bilaterally. This method has been found helpful in assessing the adequacy of neural decompression intraoperatively.\r"

The results demonstrate the efficacy of the regimen in relieving postoperative spasm. The percentage of patients requiring narcotics and the assessed pain severity were essentially uniform between the groups. Whereas postoperative spasm was a common lament, it did not represent a significant element of postoperative pain when judged by these criteria.\r"

  ".W": "The use of systemic hypothermia is known to allow recovery from potentially lethal states of profound hypoperfusion or total circulatory arrest. While the cellular alterations accompanying states of decreased perfusion in skeletal muscle are well defined, little is known regarding the impact of coexistent hypothermia. To investigate this issue, nine dogs were placed on total cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and perfused in nonpulsatile fashion. The following flow and temperature parameters were used in three different perfusion models: 3.5 L/min/m2 at 23 degrees C (group A, n = 3), 1.6 L/min/m2 at 37 degrees C (group B, n = 3), and 1.6 L/min/m2 at 23 degrees C (group C, n = 3). Assessment of cellular function in a hind limb adductor muscle by measurement of resting transmembrane potential difference (Em) and determination of tissue electrolyte distribution in a biopsy specimen was performed in the control state and again after 60 minutes of total CPB. Low-flow/hypothermic CPB (group C) was associated with depolarization of resting Em to -63.3 +/- 3.2 mV from a control value of -87.0 +/- 1.3 mV (p less than 0.05), an increase in the calculated intracellular Na ([Na]i) to 16.4 +/- 4.0 mEq/L from a control value of 7.6 +/- 1.4 mEq/L (p less than 0.05), and an increase in the ratio of the selective membrane permeabilities of Na+ to K+ (pNa/pK), to 0.067 +/- 0.013 from a control value of 0.013 +/- 0.002 (p less than 0.05). In contrast, resting Em was maintained at -86.4 +/- 6.1 mv during normal-flow/hypothermic CPB (group A), while low-flow/normothermic CPB (group B) produced an intermediate depolarization to -75.2 +/- 3.0 mV (p less than 0.05). Neither [Na]i or pNa/pK was altered significantly in group A or group B dogs. These data characterize a physiologic alteration in the cellular membrane function of skeletal muscle during low-flow/hypothermic CPB, which is similar in many respects to that accompanying hemorrhagic shock. This suggests that during periods of profound hypothermia certain flow-related derangements in skeletal muscle are not obviated and may be exacerbated.\r"

Asperlicin, a newly described, CCK antagonist, has been shown to be a potent, competitive inhibitor of CCK-induced gallbladder and ileal muscle contraction. In this study, the effects of asperlicin on CCK- and carbachol-stimulated pancreatic enzyme release from dispersed guinea pig acini were investigated. Cholecystokinin caused a dose-dependent release of amylase and lipase. Half-maximal release of amylase (17.9% +/- 2.1%, mean +/- SEM, percent of total content) and lipase (27.3% +/- 2.1%) was seen with CCK 10(-11) mmol/L) both p less than 0.01). Asperlicin (10(-11) to 10(-4) mmol/L) caused a substantial inhibition (10(-11) mmol/L) of CCK-induced amylase release with a 50% maximal effective inhibitory dose of 10(-9) mmol/L (p less than 0.01) and maximum inhibition at 10(-6) mmol/L. Asperlicin was approximately 1000-fold more potent than proglumide (a previously described CCK receptor antagonist) which had a 50% effective inhibitory dose of 10(-6) mmol/L) and a maximal effect at 10(-4) mmol/L. Asperlicin (10(-10) to 10(-4) mmol/L) failed to alter carbachol-induced amylase release. Asperlicin is a new, potent CCK antagonist for pancreatic CCK receptors and should prove useful as an investigational tool. Such receptor antagonists may have therapeutic potential.\r"

This response is preventable with the use of the opiate receptor antagonist, naloxone hydrochloride. In this study, the stereospecificity of the opiate response was tested with the use of levorphanol tartrate and its d-isomer, dextrorphan, in our Langendorff rat heart model. The interaction of muscarinic receptor activity with the opiate response was tested by first adding bethanechol chloride to the perfusate in the presence and absence of atropine (5 X 10(-9) mmol/L). Our earlier studies with morphine sulfate were then repeated in the presence of the same concentration of atropine. At a concentration of 5 X 10(-6) mmol/L, levorphanol tartrate produced a significant decrease in CO (p less than 0.05), while a similar concentration of dextrorphan produced little change in either HR or CO. Bethanechol chloride, in a concentration of 3 X 10(-6) mmol/L, produced a significant decrease in HR and CO (p less than 0.05), which was prevented by atropine. When morphine sulfate was added to the standard perfusate (3 X 10(-4) mmol/L), HR and CO were significantly decreased (p less than 0.05). This change was not prevented by the addition of atropine. The opiate effect on myocardial function is mediated by a stereospecific opiate receptor, which acts independently of muscarinic receptor antagonism.\r"

The purpose of this study was to measure regional intracellular myocardial pH (impH) in the ischemic zone in vivo during experimental canine coronary occlusion, with and without coronary reperfusion. Twenty adult dogs were studied. Ten dogs underwent permanent ligation of the proximal anterior left descending coronary artery (group L), five dogs had coronary reperfusion after 1 hour of total coronary occlusion (group R), and five dogs did not undergo ligation and served as controls (group C). Intracellular myocardial pH was measured by 31phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline and then at 15-minute intervals for 6 hours after coronary occlusion (or after sham occlusion in group C). Baseline impH did not differ among groups (group C, 7.22 +/- 0.12 mean +/- standard error of mean; group L, 7.17 +/- 0.07; group R, 7.22 +/- 0.09). During hour 1 of total occlusion, the impH of both groups L (6.58 +/- 0.05) and R (6.55 +/- 0.08) was significantly reduced as compared with the impH of group C (7.3 +/- 0.12; p less than 0.05). At 0 to 1, 1 to 3, and 3 to 5 hours of reperfusion, the impH of group R (7.34 +/- 0.08, 7.27 +/- 0.07, and 7.29 +/- 0.06, respectively for these times) did not differ from group C (7.26 +/- 0.11, 7.21 +/- 0.07, and 7.25 +/- 0.10). At these same times, the impH of group L (6.47 +/- 0.05, 6.57 +/- 0.04, and 6.75 +/- 0.04) was significantly reduced as compared with both groups R and C (p less than 0.05). Thus a severe, persistent regional intracellular myocardial acidosis occurs in the ischemic zone with coronary occlusion but is rapidly corrected by reperfusion within 1 hour.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously described a cholecysto-sphincter of Oddi reflex whereby sphincter of Oddi (SO) motility is mediated in part by the degree of gallbladder distension. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that cholecystectomy alters the response of the SO to endogenous and exogenous hormonal stimulation. Eight months after sham laparotomy (n = 8) or cholecystectomy (n = 10), prairie dogs were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose. The common bile duct was cannulated distally with a side-hole, pressure-monitored catheter perfused with degassed water at 0.15 ml/min. The duodenum was cannulated distal to the SO to allow perfusion of the proximal 30 cm of intestine with 20 mmol/L sodium oleate at 0.4 ml/min. In animals undergoing sham laparotomy the gallbladder was cannulated, aspirated, and kept empty throughout the experiment. SO phasic wave frequency (F), amplitude (A), and baseline pressure were measured for 60 minutes before and during intraduodenal (ID) perfusion of sodium oleate and then for 60 minutes before and 30 minutes during intravenous (IV) infusion of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-OP) at 10 ng/kg/min. A SO motility index (MI) (MI = F X A) was calculated for each 10-minute period. Common duct diameter and resting SO motility were unaltered 8 months after cholecystectomy. In animals that had sham laparotomy ID infusion of sodium oleate reduced SO MI by 46% (p = 0.06) and 75% (p less than 0.05) at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively, whereas in animals that had cholecystectomy the reduction in SO MI was only 6% and 25% (p less than 0.05) during the same periods. In animals that had sham laparotomy IV CCK-OP increased the SO MI by 175% (p less than 0.05), but in the animals that had cholecystectomy IV CCK-OP increased SO MI by only 60% (no significance). These findings indicate that after cholecystectomy resting SO motility is unaltered, but the response to ID sodium oleate and to IV cholecystokinin is blunted. We suggest that cholecystectomy alters neural pathways that mediate the normal response of the SO to endogenous and exogenous hormonal stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "In this study of a canine heart model of localized reversible ischemia, a computer-based single-processing method is developed to detect and localize the epicardial projections of ischemic myocardial electrocardiograms (ECGs) during the cardiac activation, rather than the repolarization, phase. This is done by transforming ECG signals from an epicardial sensor array into the multichannel spectral domain and identifying three decision variables: (1) the frequency in hertz of the spectral peak (f0), its frequency band width 50% below the peak value (w0), and the maximum eigenvalue difference of the ECG signal's autocorrelation matrix (e0). With use of the histograms of the f0, w0, and e0 parameters of 3256 ECGs from normal and 957 from ischemic areas of myocardium obtained from 12 dogs, it was possible to predict ischemia in a new test group of nine animals from a Neyman-Pearson (NP) test in which the threshold probabilities of detecting ischemia for each decision variable are compared with those of detecting normality. Quantification of each sensor area by the NP tests revealed that, compared with the control, ECG spectra with decreased F0 and w0 and increased e0 relative to their respective thresholds had increased myocardial lactate (p less than 0.01), decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (p less than 0.05), and reduced creatine phosphate (p less than 0.01). Prediction of f0 (p less than 0.0006) as a continuous variable could be obtained from the regression of the myocardial levels of ATP plus creatine phosphate, which demonstrated that this decision variable appears to directly reflect myocardial energetics. It appears that an advanced signal-processing method for ECG array data can be used to detect, localize, and quantify reversible myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The successful prevention of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in biobreeding (BB) rats--the closest animal model to human type I diabetes mellitus--by daily administrations of cyclosporine (CsA) has prompted clinical trials of CsA immunosuppression in human diabetes. Although remissions from hyperglycemia have been achieved in human subjects, nephrotoxicity and recurrence of diabetes after discontinuation of CsA have been observed. Therefore we studied the biologic efficacy of intermittent administration of CsA, a theoretically less dangerous immunosuppressive protocol, in the prevention of spontaneous diabetes in the BB rat. Beginning at 30 to 49 or 50 to 55 days of age, treated animals (n = 86) received daily injections of CsA (15 mg/Kg) for 2 weeks (induction phase) and then twice weekly (maintenance phase) until 160 days of age. A third group of animals (n = 31) received daily CsA for 14 days only. Control littermates (n = 121) were not injected. All animals were followed to 275 days of age. Intermittent administration of CsA was determined to be a biologically effective regimen in the prevention of spontaneous diabetes in the BB rat. Blood levels of CsA and the major CsA metabolites were undetectable intermittently during the course of therapy. Major complications associated with CsA immunosuppression (nephrotoxicity, malignancy, and infection) were not associated with the intermittent CsA protocol. We conclude that spontaneous diabetes can be delayed and often permanently prevented by intermittent administration of CsA. This immunosuppressive regimen deserves further consideration as a biologically effective, but theoretically less toxic, therapeutic regimen.\r"

This study tested the efficacy of a temporary dAVF for the treatment of venous hypertension in an experimental model. Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were divided into two experimental groups. Group I rabbits (n = 12) underwent standardized ligation of the iliac and femoral venous systems. Group II rabbits (n = 12) underwent standardized ligation of the iliac and femoral venous systems with the formation of a temporary dAVF. Venous obstruction was documented with venography, and venous hypertension was documented with femoral venous pressure measurements. Venous pressure, resistance, blood flow, vein circumference, vein cross-sectional area, vein wall thickness, and venography were compared between four rabbits from each group at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. The effect of differences in baseline venous pressures was eliminated by subtracting the venous pressure in the unobstructed rabbit limb from the pressure in the obstructed rabbit leg. Group II rabbits had a lower standardized venous pressure (4.4 +/- 2.2 versus 9.5 +/- 4.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and venous outflow resistance (0.16 +/- 0.08 versus 0.36 +/- 0.18, p less than 0.05) than did group I rabbits. Group II rabbits also had a larger superficial femoral vein circumference (3.46 +/- 0.67 versus 2.57 +/- 0.08 mm, p less than 0.05) and cross-sectional area (0.66 +/- 0.31 versus 0.31 +/- 0.09 mm2, p less than 0.01) than did group I rabbits. The improvement persisted throughout the 6-week study, which suggested an improved venous outflow.\r"

Cachexia might improve if this lipolytic action of cancer cells could be halted. This study examined the lipolytic activities of media from four tumor cell lines after treatment with retinoic acid (RA), a cell differentiation inducer. An in vitro adipocyte bioassay measured lipolysis. All four tumor cell lines were intrinsically lipolytic, with elevated baseline lipolytic activities relative to fibroblast-conditioned controls (128% to 287% of control, p less than 0.05). After a 2-week exposure to RA in culture medium followed by 3 days of continued growth in fresh medium, two of four cell lines (both rat prostatic adenocarcinomas) showed significantly reduced lipolytic activities (16% and 61% of corresponding untreated controls, p less than 0.05). These reductions in lipolytic activity after RA treatment were not generalized phenomena; nor were they simply caused by cell differentiation, as the other cell lines (human malignant melanoma and human ovarian teratocarcinoma) showed no reductions despite evidence of cell differentiation. No effect on lipolytic activity was seen after only a 24-hour exposure to RA. We conclude that RA can affect the lipolytic activity of certain tumor cells in vitro, perhaps by influencing tumor-producing lipolytic factor(s).\r"

This study hypothesizes that such nutritional support will only favor that host generating a potent antitumor immune response. Murine neuroblastoma (NB) was characterized into immunizing C1300-NB and nonimmunizing TBJ-NB cell lines; and 100 6-week-old strain A mice were assigned on day -14 to isocaloric dietary groups (24% or 2.5% protein). At day 0, mice received either C1300-NB or TBJ-NB; on day 7 one half of the 2.5% group mice were repleted with 24% protein; on day 21, tumor weight/carcass weight (T/C) and mortality (M) were noted. Body weight increased 12.8% in the 24% group and fell 11.4% in the 2.5% group (p less than 0.01). The T/C ratios were smaller for immunogenic C1300-NB on 24% protein compared with 2.5% chow (0.0033 versus 0.0229; p less than 0.02). Repletion produced smaller tumors in the C1300-NB host; strikingly, repletion of TBJ-NB mice significantly increased tumor burden (T/C = 0.0186 versus 0.1657, p less than 0.01) and also increased animal mortality (M = 20% to 30%, p = NS). These data suggest that the influence of nutritional repletion on the tumor-bearing host varies specifically with the presence of an antitumor immune response.\r"

Students were tested with a multiple-choice examination (MCQ) and a highly structured oral examination (OE) administered by faculty members blinded about student group. Results of a between-within analysis of variance performed separately for breast and thyroid disease yielded significant group differences because of instructional method for thyroid disease (p = 0.003) and approached significance for breast disease (p = 0.095). Although no significant interactions were detected with percentage scores, a significant interaction between group membership and test type was noted for thyroid disease when the percentage scores were transformed to Z scores. We conclude that regardless of topic or testing method, students in POSGS tended to perform better than students in a DL and that the POSGS offers significant advantages over the DL in teaching surgery to third-year medical students.\r"

All residents are evaluated by supervisory faculty after each clinical rotation. The same evaluation process has been used throughout this time, assessing residents on a five-point scale (1 = best) in each of six attributes: ethics, judgment, technical skills, knowledge, interpersonal skills, and work habits. The faculty evaluations of general surgery residents from academic years 1967 to 1985 were reviewed. A total of 2356 evaluations of 144 residents (22% female) by 69 faculty members (22% female) was available. For valid comparison, a subset of 702 evaluations was selected. Included were only those evaluations in which residents at the same level of training during the same academic year were evaluated by the same faculty members and in which both the resident and faculty groups had both male and female members. The average scores for male and female residents were nearly identical as determined by male and female faculty members, and no differences were statistically significant. In our program, with more than 20% women residents and faculty members over a 19-year period, no bias related to gender was demonstrated.\r"

Mice subjected to a left paraspinal incision then underwent either cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation (sham). Abscesses and an early decrease in food intake developed in all CLP mice, but the animals resumed normal food consumption by day 7. The CLP animals had an initial 20% weight loss; however, by day 11 they had a gradual return toward control weight. Fresh and formalin-fixed wound disruption strengths determined on days 7 through 35 revealed a significant weakness in CLP animals. To examine the role of nutritional intake, an additional set of experiments were performed with the following groups: CLP, sham, no operation (control), or sham operation with pair-feeding an amount equal to that consumed by the CLP group to reproduce only the nutritional deficit (sham/dep). At 7 and 11 days, fresh wound-disruption strengths of both CLP and sham/dep animals were significantly weaker than those of control or sham animals. A defect in formalin-fixed healing also existed for sham/dep mice at day 11. These findings suggest that short-term reduction in nutrient intake as a result of infection may be a major determinant of impaired wound healing.\r"

Although iron deficiency alters the activities of several hepatic enzymes, its effects on biliary lipid metabolism are not known. The aim of this study was to define the role of dietary iron in pigment gallstone formation. Three groups of prairie dogs were maintained for 2 months on either a control chow (iron-198 ppm), a high-carbohydrate diet with normal iron levels (CHO group; iron-220 ppm), or a high-carbohydrate, iron-deficient (iron-56 ppm) diet (CHO-FeD group). Serum analysis confirmed iron deficiency in the CHO-FeD group. The CHO animals had a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in hepatic bile phospholipids, while CHO-FeD animals had increased (p less than 0.01) concentrations of phospholipids and cholesterol as compared with controls. Similar findings were noted in gallbladder bile with the addition of increased calcium levels in both carbohydrate groups. Calcium bilirubinate crystals and stones were found in only 17% of CHO animals, as compared with 67% of CHO-FeD animals. These data indicate that consumption of diets rich in carbohydrates but deficient in iron alters hepatic metabolism of cholesterol and may be an important etiologic factor in pigment gallstone formation. Iron supplementation may prevent pigment gallstones in certain high-risk groups.\r"

Regional left ventricular (LV) function was assessed in open chest pigs with sonomicrometry and micromanometry to calculate an index of regional work from the LV pressure-segment length relationship. After measuring baseline preischemic function, the left anterior descending artery was occluded, creating a region-at-risk in 20% of the LV mass. Cardiopulmonary bypass was begun 15 minutes after initiation of regional ischemia and was followed immediately by cardioplegic arrest for 45 minutes, after which time the coronary artery occluder was removed to simulate coronary revascularization. Starting just before removal of the aortic cross-clamp and continuing for the first 30 minutes of reflow, animals received an aortic root infusion of either superoxide dismutase (3600 U/kg) and catalase (20,000 U/kg) or a control saline solution infusion. In each group, seven animals were successfully weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without inotropic support. After 2 hour of reperfusion, the recovery of baseline function in the region-at-risk was 44% +/- 7% in the treated animals and 4% +/- 13% in the untreated animals (p less than 0.05). In this experimental model, oxygen free radical scavengers were effective in preserving functional recovery in regionally ischemic myocardium reperfused under conditions simulating surgical revascularization in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia.\r"

The relative contribution of chronic cyanosis alone to the postoperative deterioration in left ventricular function remains unknown. To study the effects of chronic cyanosis on left ventricular function, nine dogs underwent inferior vena cava-to-left atrial anastomosis, a model that minimizes abnormal left ventricular hemodynamic loads. After at least 6 months of chronic cyanosis (mean arterial pO2 of 44 mm Hg and mean hematocrit of 61%), the dogs were instrumented with ultrasonic dimension transducers and micromanometers for collection of left ventricular pressure-dimension data. Studies were performed 7 to 10 days after recovery from instrumentation while the dogs were awake and alert. Nine normal dogs were also instrumented and served as controls. Pressure and dimension data were collected during transient vena cava occlusions before and after the combined administration of propranolol and atropine to produce autonomic blockade. Contractile function as measured by dP/dt, ejection fraction, and the stroke work-end diastolic length relationship was decreased by autonomic blockade to a similar extent in both normal and cyanotic dogs. After autonomic blockade, normal dogs were able to maintain stroke volume and cardiac index by utilization of Frank-Starling reserves (increased left ventricular end diastolic volume). In contrast, dogs with cyanosis were unable to maintain stroke volume and cardiac index or to increase left ventricular end diastolic volume after autonomic blockade. Dogs with cyanosis had reduced ventricular diastolic compliance, and they more fully used Frank-Starling reserves to maintain normal stroke volume and cardiac index in the control state when compared with normal dogs. The diminished preload reserves of the cyanotic dogs limited systolic performance (stroke volume and cardiac index) only at reduced levels of contractility produced by autonomic blockade.\r"

Necturus antrum was mounted in a modified Ussing chamber, and pHi was determined from the difference between the potentials recorded by intracellular conventional and pH-sensitive microelectrodes. In tissues bathed with bicarbonate-buffered Ringer's solution (pH 7), acidification of the mucosal solution to pH 4.5 by isotonic replacement of the NaHCO3 with NaCl had no significant effects on pHi. In contrast, acidification of the serosal solution to pH 4.5 by replacing the bicarbonate reduced pHi from 7.32 +/- 0.04 to 6.95 +/- 0.06 (p less than 0.001, n = 8). Similarly, in tissues bathed with HEPES-buffered Ringer's solution (pH 7.0), pHi was unaffected by reducing the mucosal solution pH to 4.5 with HCl but fell 0.21 +/- 0.05 pH units (p less than 0.01, n = 7) during acidification of the serosal solution to pH 6. These results suggest that gastric epithelium is more sensitive to acidification from the serosal than the mucosal side. Such a finding is consistent with the concept of a gastric mucosal barrier to luminal acid. It may also explain the gastric epithelium's greater sensitivity to acute ulceration during systemic acidosis.\r"

  ".W": "Sarcoma cells exhibit higher rates of glycolysis than normal tissues and may be dependent on glucose utilization for growth. Accordingly, we tested the ability of the glucose antimetabolite 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) to inhibit the growth of an established methylcholanthrene-induced rat fibrosarcoma in three groups of F344 rats with increasing subcutaneous inoculations of tumor (2 X 10(6) cells, 1 X 10(7) cells, and 1 mm tumor fragments). Rats were randomized to receive 2-DG or saline solution at doses of 0.75 gm/kg, 1.5 gm/kg, or 1.75 gm/kg, beginning 3 days after tumor implantation and continuing for 10 days. Tumors were removed and weighed on day 14. We measured tissue [14C]-2-DG levels in tumor, brain, liver, and muscle after intraperitoneal injection of radiolabeled 2-DG. In these same tissues we determined the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), an enzyme which dephosphorylates the intracellular glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG-6-phosphate, thus reversing the antitumor effect of 2-DG. All groups treated with 2-DG had a significant reduction in tumor weight of 50% to 70% when compared with saline solution-treated controls. Toxicity was substantial at the highest dose of 2-DG, but minimal toxicity was noted at intermediate and low doses. Tumor had the greatest uptake of [14C]-2-DG, with low levels of G-6-Pase leading to prolonged retention and highest tissue levels of radiolabeled 2-DG. Use of 2-DG inhibits established sarcoma growth because it is rapidly transported into tumors, cannot be metabolized after phosphorylation, and is dephosphorylated and released slowly from tumor cells. Rat sarcoma growth is dependent on glucose utilization and can be effectively inhibited by glucose antagonism.\r"

  ".W": "Although hypertension has been shown to increase myointimal thickening after arterial injury, a similar effect of nicotine has not been demonstrated. To compare the influence of nicotine with the known effect of hypertension, a standard balloon catheter injury was created in the aortas of four groups of experimental animals. A preliminary group (P) (n = 11) consisted of adult Wistar Kyoto rats used to determine the degree of denudation and the time course of arterial healing; group I (n = 10) consisted of adult Wistar Kyoto rats; group II (n = 13) consisted of spontaneously hypertensive rats; and group III (n = 16) consisted of Wistar Kyoto rats fed nicotine. Endothelial denudation was achieved after an identical injury with an aortic balloon catheter; completeness of denudation was confirmed in group P with Evans blue stain. Injured vessels were fixed by perfusion at 2- and 9-week intervals. Intima to media (I/M) ratios were measured at 82 points per animal by use of light microscopy. Computer-assisted statistical analysis was performed with the t test and Wilcoxon nonpaired rank sum test. Serum nicotine levels were maintained in group III at 73.3 +/- 36.7 ng/ml, which is comparable to levels in human smokers. There were no significant differences in I/M ratios between any of the groups at 2 weeks. At 9 weeks both groups II and III had significantly higher I/M ratios than did control subjects (p = 0.039). The nicotine-treated group had greater myointimal thickening than did the hypertensive animals (p = 0.02). Since there was no hypertension or tachycardia in nicotine-treated rats, we postulate that our data reflects the desquamating effect of nicotine.\r"

The effects of methoxamine (alpha-agonist) and isoproterenol (beta-agonist) on colon contractions and blood flow were studied in nine monkeys. Phentolamine (alpha-antagonist) and propranolol (beta-antagonist) were used to block the effects of the appropriate agonist. Methoxamine caused a dose-related inhibition of colon contractions and a decrease in inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) blood flow. Isoproterenol caused a dose-related inhibition of colon contractions and an increase in IMA blood flow. The contractile and blood flow effects of methoxamine were blocked by phentolamine and those of isoproterenol by propranolol. Mechanical reduction of IMA blood flow by an amount equivalent to that observed with the highest dose of methoxamine caused no change in contractions in the segment of colon supplied by the IMA. Both alpha- and beta-agonists inhibit colon contractions and have the expected effects on IMA blood flow. The contractile and blood flow responses of the agonists can be blocked by appropriate antagonists. The blood flow changes are not responsible for the contractile changes. These results indicate that sympathetic hyperactivity may play a role in postoperative ileus.\r"

The aetiology and measures that may be taken to avoid this complication are discussed. The medicolegal consequences need no emphasis and it is recommended that finger palpation alone as a method of assessing the adequacy of distal aortic pressure should be abandoned in favour of continuous electromanometric visual display of the aortic pressure in all patients. In the long term, serious consideration must be given to developing spinal cord monitoring using somatosensory evoked potentials.\r"

In 38 (84%) complement receptor enhancement was below a range of values previously established for monocytes from 48 healthy control subjects and from 12 patients with non-malignant respiratory diseases. It was found that all 38 patients with reduced complement receptor enhancement had either local or widespread metastases, as determined by the chest radiograph and a variable combination of chest tomography, liver, bone and brain scanning, computed tomography, fibreoptic bronchoscopy, bone marrow aspiration, liver function tests, mediastinoscopy, and surgical assessment, where appropriate. By contrast, at the time of presentation there was no clear relationship between abnormal values in several conventional screening haematological or biochemical tests and the stage of the tumour. These results suggest that complement receptor enhancement might serve as a useful pointer to the extent of the disease, since low values were associated with extension within the chest and very low values were found with widespread metastases.\r"

As observed in animal studies, the thermal dye measurement of extravascular thermal volume (EVTV) consistently overestimated gravimetric extravascular lung water (EVLW), the mean (SEM) difference being 3.43 (0.59) ml/kg. In eight of the nine subjects the EVTV -3.43 ml/kg would yield an estimate of EVLW that would be from 3.23 ml/kg under to 3.37 ml/kg over the actual value EVLW at the 95% confidence limits. Reproducibility, assessed with the standard error of the mean percentage, suggested that a 15% change in EVTV can be reliably detected with repeated measurements. One subject was excluded from analysis because the EVTV measurement grossly underestimated its actual EVLW. This error was associated with regional injury observed on gross examination of the lung. Experimental and clinical evidence suggest that the thermal dye measurement provides a reliable estimate of lung water in diffuse pulmonary oedema states.\r"

On the basis of previous work, many of the subjects in this study would have been assessed as having small airways obstruction. The number of subjects is larger than in previous studies of airflow in this age group. Old people have often smoked, and many have a history of cardiovascular disease. Such individuals were included provided that they were fit and active for their age, and had no overt respiratory disease. It is argued that our findings will be of more clinical relevance to the elderly population than values derived either from population studies or studies that have used rigorous selection criteria to exclude subjects who smoked or had a history of non-respiratory disease.\r"

In myasthenic patients small transverse sternotomy enabled radical thymectomy to be performed with an uneventful postoperative course and very good cosmetic results. There were no hospital deaths among patients with myasthenia gravis after thymectomy. The long term results, assessed after 18-24 months, were good: the total remission rate was 39.5%, and there was a great improvement in 48.5% and an improvement in 9%. After thymectomy about 30% of patients received supplementary treatment with prednisone. A correlation between the duration of symptoms and the result of thymectomy was established: the shorter the duration of myasthenia gravis the better the results. In the small group of 20 patients with thymomas two died in hospital. In 12 patients with encapsulated thymic tumours the long term results were similar to those in patients with myasthenia gravis, whereas in patients with infiltrating thymic tumours the results were unsatisfactory.\r"

Opportunistic infections are readily recognised in endoscopic material, but pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma is easily missed, so that patients are deprived of specific treatment. The clinical and pathological findings from nine cases of pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma have been reviewed; these were found among 84 patients with AIDS and pneumonitis undergoing fibreoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. Diagnosis was established before death in eight patients (in five by bronchial biopsy and in three by open lung biopsy). Examination of lavage fluid showed alveolar haemorrhage in six patients. It is concluded that: (1) fibreoptic bronchoscopy may be useful in the diagnosis of endobronchial lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma; (2) alveolar haemorrhage in patients with AIDS is suggestive of pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma. Factors that may cause difficulties in diagnosis include the focal nature of some lesions and the pleural or parenchymatous location of others. In addition, in the lung as in the skin, the early stages of Kaposi's sarcoma resemble granulation tissue. Such lesions are far more difficult to recognise than is the late nodular stage.\r"

Previous observers have commented on the repeated failure to establish a diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma of the lung by fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Thirteen fibreoptic bronchoscopies were performed in a series of 11 patients with thoracic manifestations of AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma was identified in transbronchial or bronchial biopsy specimens in four patients. This diagnostic yield is comparable to that obtained only by open lung biopsy procedures in previous reports. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy may contribute to the correct management of the patient and facilitate an accurate prognosis by differentiating between opportunistic pneumonia and pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma.\r"

Significant correlations were seen between changes in FEV1, TLCO and KCO and the preoperative function of the resected lung as determined by percentage preoperative perfusion to that lung (p less than 0.001). There were mean decreases in FEV1 of 22% and in vital capacity (VC) of 28.7% predicted. Estimation of postoperative FEV1 from the preoperative values showed equally good agreement with measured postoperative values whether 99mTc perfusion or 81mKr ventilation scans were used in the 11 patients in whom both scans were available.

Estimation of postoperative maximum ventilation and maximum oxygen uptake from the postoperative values on the basis of 99mTc perfusion scans showed good agreement with observed values. Perfusion scans are useful in estimating not only the changes in spirometric indices that follow pneumonectomy for bronchial carcinoma but also changes in carbon monoxide transfer and exercise capacity.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy consecutive lung fine needle aspirates (FNA) from 69 patients were examined by cytology/cell block histology, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and, where available, at histological follow up to determine the value of TEM in interpreting lung FNAs. Of 70 FNAs, 50 were suitable for TEM. Transmission electron microscopy was helpful in classifying seven of 10 poorly differentiated tumours, and two case histories are reported. In 26 of 30 well differentiated tumours TEM confirmed diagnosis by light microscopy. Two TEM false negatives, but no TEM false positives, were recorded. It is concluded that transmission electron microscopy of cells aspirated from lung can be helpful when unequivocal diagnosis has not been achieved.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchial responsiveness to inhaled histamine was measured two, seven, and 30 hours after allergen inhalation challenge in 19 atopic subjects. The provocative histamine concentrations causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) at these three times were compared with the baseline value, with values obtained two and seven hours after diluent inhalation, and with those obtained five to seven days after allergen challenge in the 12 late responders. Seven subjects had allergen induced isolated early asthmatic responses (delta FEV1 22.6% (SD 6.6%)) with less than a 5% late fall in FEV1. There was no change in the six histamine PC20 values measured in these seven subjects; the geometric mean PC20 was 1.0-1.3 mg/ml on all six occasions. Twelve subjects had an allergen induced early asthmatic response (delta FEV1 26.3% (9.8%)) followed by a definite (greater than 15% delta FEV1, n = 7) or equivocal (5-15% delta FEV1, n = 5) late asthmatic response. The geometric mean histamine PC20 was not significantly different two hours after allergen inhalation either from baseline (0.67 v 0.78 mg/ml) or from that seen two hours after diluent (0.67 v 0.95). It was significantly reduced at seven (0.24 mg/ml) and at 30 hours (0.44 mg/ml) but had returned to baseline when repeated five to seven days later (0.74 mg/ml). In 10 subjects with a dual response who had a repeat antigen challenge the mean early and late response and delta PC20 at seven and 30 hours were similar. These data show that bronchial responsiveness to a non-allergic stimulus has not increased two hours after allergen inhalation following spontaneous recovery of the early asthmatic response but before the start of the late asthmatic response.\r"

  ".W": "From March 1967 to February 1985 91 patients aged from 11 months to 53 years underwent surgical treatment of isolated coarctation of the aorta. The surgical procedures in descending order of frequency, were: resection with end to end anastomosis, resection with replacement by a tube graft, patch aortoplasty, and bypass graft. Resection with end to end anastomosis was achieved mainly in younger patients. The number of patients needing other procedures increased with advancing age. Eighty six patients have been followed up (mean 10 years). There were no hospital or late deaths and none of the patients suffered from spinal cord injury. There were three recurrences of the coarctation, all in patients who had had primary reconstruction below the age of one year. The patients were divided into three groups by age: group 1, 0-5 years; group 2, 6-15 years; and group 3, over 15 years. It was found that there was no late hypertension in group 1 while hypertension persisted in 7% of group 2 and in 28% of group 3. Fifty per cent of the patients with persistent hypertension were above the age of 20 years at the time of operation and had resection with replacement by a tube graft. It is recommended that elective surgery for coarctation of the aorta should be performed at the age of 3-5 years to avoid both recurrence of stenosis and persistent hypertension.\r"
