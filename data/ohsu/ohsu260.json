  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that an anabolic steroid such as nandrolone decanoate (ND) will ameliorate or abolish disuse-mediated alterations resulting from five weeks of hindlimb immobilization, female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: control, control + ND, shortened-immobilized, shortened-immobilized + ND, stretched-immobilized, and stretched-immobilized + ND. Immobilization was accomplished by wrapping hindlimbs with plaster of Paris. Nandrolone decanoate in sesame oil was administered via weekly intraperitoneal injection (7 mg/kg) while nontreated rats received equivalent volumes of the vehicle. After five weeks selected morphometric, biochemical, and mechanical parameters were examined in the slow-twitch soleus muscle (SOL). Muscle wet weight fell from a control value of 145 +/- 19 mg to 70 +/- 8 mg (p less than .05) in the immobilized-shortened group where ND had no effect (81 +/- 11 mg). Muscle stretch alone prevented weight loss (159 +/- 31 mg). The addition of ND resulted in significant SOL hypertrophy (200 +/- 42 mg), p less than .05. Immobilization resulted in a significant shift in muscle protein distribution toward sarcoplasmic protein, a change unaltered by ND but abolished by stretch. Muscle strength, as indicated by peak tetanic tension, fell 45% (p less than .05) as a result of shortened immobilization. Nandrolone decanoate had no effect on this condition, although the ameliorating effect of stretch was abolished when in combination with ND treatment. The elevation observed in maximal shortening velocity (shortened-immobilized) was unaffected by ND alone, but abolished by stretch with or without ND treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Test endpoints considered prognostically significant for future cardiac events were (1) ST segment depression greater than or equal to 1mm, (2) angina pectoris, and (3) complex ventricular beats. Test endpoints were assigned to both low-level and high-level tests if they occurred less than or equal to 4.6 METS; test endpoints greater than 4.6 METS were assigned to the high-level test only. Allowing the 145 patients who were asymptomatic during the low-level test to continue into the high-level protocol revealed a 2.5 times greater occurrence of angina pectoris (38 vs 15), a 3.4 times greater occurrence of ST segment depression (27 vs 8), and twice the occurrences of ventricular beats (4 vs 2). This substantial increase in prognostic endpoint yield was demonstrated in the presence of a significantly longer exercise time with the high-level test (9.0 vs 5.1 min), with no significant difference between protocols for peak heart rate or systolic blood pressure. Therefore, a high-level graded exercise test appears to increase the yield of test endpoints with known prognostic importance.\r"

At baseline (4 degrees C PMN isolation), septic-derived PMNs were activated, as manifested by twofold increases in fmet-leu-phe (FMLP)-induced oxidative activity and concomitant FMLP surface receptor expression, compared with controls. Following degranulationlike maximal activation (phorbol myristate acetate pretreatment), both PMN populations exhibited maximal FMLP-induced oxidative priming and receptor up-regulation. However, following exudation-like moderate activation (37 degrees C pretreatment), control PMNs underwent significant receptor mobilization and oxidative priming but septic-derived PMNs exhibited oxidative deactivation (decreased FMLP-induced oxidative activity) without changes in FMLP receptor expression. Our data support the theory that while circulating PMNs in sepsis may promote oxidant-related microvascular lung injury, their oxidative deactivation following transpulmonary exudation (simulated by 37 degrees C pretreatment) may underlie the increased incidence of pulmonary infections seen in sepsis-induced adult respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

As a control, we conducted a similar review in 59 children with perforated appendicitis during the same period. Necrotizing enterocolitis was characterized by a lower incidence of polymicrobial contamination (1.7 organisms per patient vs 2.4 organisms per patient, NEC vs appendicitis) and an uncharacteristic pattern of isolates. Although enteric gram-negative bacilli were recovered in 80% of newborns, the incidence of Escherichia coli was only 21% in the NEC group vs 69% in the appendicitis group, while Klebsiella and Enterobacter species represented the most common gram-negative isolates recovered (63% vs 17%). More than 50% of neonatal cultures yielded gram-positive cocci, most frequently coagulase-negative staphylococci (30% vs 0%) and enterococci (17% vs 5%), as compared with more frequent streptococcal isolates in the appendicitis group (50% vs 10%). Anaerobes were seldom recovered in NEC cases (6%), but they were present in 50% of appendicitis cases. Additionally, Candida isolates were recovered in 10% of NEC cases (0% of appendicitis group). These results indicate the unique bacteriology of peritonitis in the critically ill newborn and probably reflect abnormal colonization in the neonatal intensive care unit.\r"

Thirteen percent of these patients had one or more cultures positive for Candida from any site. Three patients (1.8%) developed Candida sepsis, which was diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs of sepsis, a positive blood culture for Candida, and at least two additional culture sites positive for Candida. All three patients were treated with amphotericin B. One of these patients died of Candida sepsis, for an overall mortality of 0.6%. Therefore, Candida septicemia was not a major cause of morbidity or mortality in our burn patients in the Intensive Care Unit during this 18-month period under the current management regimen.\r"

Incubation of neutrophils in autologous serum, but not in plasma, increased the mean (+/- SD) expression of CR1 (x3.43 +/- 0.93) and CR3 (x3.07 +/- 0.86), in comparison with incubation in buffer. Serum also increased neutrophil superoxide production in response to opsonized zymosan from 0.48 +/- 0.21 to 1.05 +/- 0.25 nmol/10(6) cells/min. Similarly, calcium conversion of platelet-rich plasma (but not platelet-poor plasma) to serum also increased both CR1 and CR3 expression. This finding, as well as the fact that freeze-thawed platelet-rich plasma (but not platelet-poor plasma) increased CR expression, indicated that platelet constituents were the origin of this CR-inducing activity. Other nonplatelet factors formed during coagulation, such as C5a, fibrinogen degradation products, kallikrein, and factor XIIa, were shown not to be responsible for this CR-inducing activity.\r"

The protein degradation rate during incubation in vitro with or without the cathepsin B inhibitor leupeptin was also determined. Both protein degradation and cathepsin B activity were increased in muscles from septic rats. Incubation with leupeptin reduced, but did not normalize, the protein degradation rate in both extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles from septic animals. These studies suggest that increased cathepsin B activity contributes to the accelerated muscle proteolysis seen during sepsis and that proteases other than cathepsin B are also involved.\r"

Thirty-nine patients developed cellulitis after direct exposure to ocean water, nine had eaten raw oysters, and three had no obvious exposure to seawater. Twenty-two patients (44%) had an underlying illness that might have made them compromised hosts and predisposed them to infection. Twelve patients developed necrotizing infections. Thirteen patients ultimately died. These infections are susceptible to many antibiotics. Debridement is necessary when tissue necrosis occurs. Surgeons should suspect a marine vibrio infection if cellulitis occurs in a patient who has been near ocean water or has eaten raw oysters. These infections may not become apparent until a traveler has returned home, a place that may be far from the ocean.\r"

While Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and enterococci were the most common isolates from infections present at the time of ICU admission, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida, and Pseudomonas dominated infections occurring in patients with high MOF scores. Mortality correlated highly with infection due to S epidermidis or Candida and only poorly with infection due to Pseudomonas or E coli; significant foci of invasive infection were frequently absent at autopsy. Quantitative cultures of proximal gastrointestinal fluid in 16 of these patients showed Candida, S epidermidis, and Pseudomonas to be the most common isolates, and all but one patient colonized with these organisms had invasive infection with the same organism. The proximal gastrointestinal tract appears to be an important occult reservoir of the predominant pathogens in MOF.\r"

Progressively increasing doses of zymosan produced characteristic hemodynamic changes of progressively deteriorating stages of hyperdynamic sepsis. In addition, complement activation resulted in a redistribution of systemic blood flow with hepatic hypoperfusion similar to that seen in sepsis. Renal blood flow was unaffected early after complement activation. Additional rats were studied from the control and a representative zymosan-treated group at 24 and 48 hours to determine if the hemodynamic changes observed at two hours persisted or resolved. All systemic hemodynamic measures returned to normal at both 24 and 48 hours. Liver blood flow, however, remained depressed and actually deteriorated over time. Renal perfusion, which was stable at both two and 24 hours, fell below control values in the zymosan-treated group at 48 hours. We conclude that complement may be a mediator of both systemic and visceral flow abnormalities that precede, and perhaps precipitate, organ failure in trauma and sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "The synthesis of acute-phase proteins by the liver during sepsis has been thought to be induced primarily by monokines released from activated macrophages, although glucocorticoid hormones may also stimulate this process to a lesser degree. According to this concept, synthesis of these proteins following administration of bacterial endotoxins would be an indirect effect and would not reflect a direct interaction of the endotoxin molecule with the hepatic parenchymal cell. We observed, however, that the synthesis of a 23-kilodalton protein was stimulated directly by the addition of lipopolysaccharide to cultures of primary mouse hepatocytes. The synthesis of this protein was also stimulated by glucocorticoids and interleukin 1. These findings demonstrate that certain hepatic proteins are subject to complex regulation by several factors thought to be important mediators of sepsis; in addition, they suggest that hepatic parenchymal cells may have the intrinsic capacity to respond directly to bacterial endotoxins.\r"

Of 12 variables tested, four were found to have predictive value. These were age, pulmonary disease, preoperative shock, and the attending surgeon. When these four variables were employed in a logistic regression equation on 42 patients, it correctly predicted which 21 patients died before leaving the hospital. To produce an equation useful for other hospitals, we recalculated it without the attending surgeon variable. Again, the equation was used to predict survival. The correlation of predicted vs observed outcome remained high, and, using a 2 x 2 chi 2 test, the correlation was significant. We then cross validated the three-variable model on data from a second hospital. The model accurately predicted the new data equally well. We believe that predictive models can identify risk factors in a variety of patient populations and can determine who is likely to benefit from specific treatment modalities.\r"

Twenty-five patients underwent surgery following the bacteremia. In ten of 12 operations performed shortly after the septicemia, bile culture yielded the same organism(s) as in the blood. The types of organisms in blood, and especially the important role of streptococci, must be taken into consideration when choosing antibiotics for therapy for and prevention of biliary septicemia.\r"

The lesions, located on the gastric side of the anastomosis, consisted of polypoid mucosal changes associated with hyperplasia and cystic dilatation of glands. Radiologic and endoscopic findings were often nondiagnostic, and surgical intervention was necessary to relieve obstruction and to rule out carcinoma. Resection of the gastrojejunostomy site and choosing anastomotic techniques to minimize bile reflux into the stomach appear to be the preferred methods of treatment.\r"

Causative organisms are those normally found in the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts; however, anaerobic bacteria have been demonstrated in only 1% of cases. We describe a case of emphysematous pyelonephritis, which presented as an acute abdomen with pneumoperitoneum in a nondiabetic patient. No visceral injury was found at laparotomy. Multiple gas-producing organisms, including Clostridium ramosum (not previously reported, to our knowledge), were the cause of the free intraperitoneal and perinephric air. Subsequent radical nephrectomy revealed a xanthogranulomatous kidney. An aggressive surgical approach combined with intensive antibiotic therapy, after aerobic and anaerobic culture of excised tissue, is lifesaving.\r"

An examination of otolith function, ocular counterrolling, was performed on eight patients with this disorder. The test consisted of photographing both eyes while the subject underwent rotation in both naso-occipital and earth-horizontal long axes. Measurements of eye torsion were made with a superimposition technique accurate to 0.1 degrees. Results showed all eight patients had abnormal ocular counterrolling. The most notable defect was the lack of sustained eye torsion at the extreme positions, resulting in rolling of the eyes in the direction of head tilt rather than counterrolling, a phenomenon previously observed only in persons with known brain-stem problems. That finding, as well as the majority of the patients showing spontaneous vestibular nystagmus in the dark and directional preponderance with caloric stimulation, implies that one difficulty in spasmodic torticollis lies in central vestibular connections, manifested by disruption of brain-stem pathways.\r"

Some investigators have found evoked-potential abnormalities, while others have not. We recorded brain-stem auditory-evoked potentials in six patients with otherwise normal result of examinations and laboratory studies. Brain-stem auditory-evoked potentials were recorded from Cz-A1 and Cz-A2 with rarefaction clicks delivered at 11.1/s and 70 dB above sensory threshold with 40-dB contralateral masking. Analysis time was 10 ms, filter bandpass was 150 to 3000 Hz, and 4000 averages were replicated. Patients and age-matched controls were compared by Student's t test. One patient had I-III and I-V interpeak latencies (IPLs) beyond clinical norms (99% tolerance limit). Mean IPLs ipsilateral to torticollis were 2.32 +/- 0.2 (I-III), 1.96 +/- 0.4 (III-V), and 4.16 +/- 0.3 (I-V). Contralateral IPLs were 2.0 +/- 0.2 (I-III), 2.0 +/- 0.2 (III-V), and 3.9 +/- 0.5 (I-V). Control values were 2.04 +/- 0.2 (I-III), 1.86 +/- 0.2 (III-V), and 3.86 +/- 0.4 (I-V). Absolute latencies, V/I amplitude ratios, and III-V IPLs did not differ significantly between patients and controls, nor did IPLs contralateral to torticollis. Ipsilateral I-III and I-V IPLs were greater in patients than in controls. These findings are consistent with those of some clinical reports and with experimental evidence that brain-stem lesions produce torticollis. They imply brain-stem dysfunction ipsilateral to head deviation in at least some patients with torticollis.\r"

This apparent antiseizure effect of clomiphene is discussed in terms of three possible mechanisms of action: (1) Clomiphene may benefit seizures by raising serum levels of antiseizure medications.

Counts were made of SPs and NFTs on the left and right side of five different brain areas, which included middle frontal, superior temporal, the prosubiculum of the hippocampus (HPR), the entorhinal cortex of the hippocampus (HEN), and the basal nucleus of Meynert. The density of SPs was bilaterally symmetrical in all regions except the basal nucleus of Meynert in which technical problems may have occurred in sampling. In contrast to SPs, the density of NFTs was bilaterally symmetrical in both neocortical regions (middle frontal, superior temporal), but not in either hippocampal region (HPR, HEN). The absence of bilateral symmetry for the density of NFTs in the hippocampus, where the density of SPs was highly symmetrical, suggests that there may be a different pathogenesis for these lesions in Alzheimer's disease. The lack of a significant correlation between SP and NFT density within four of five regions, including HPR and HEN, also supports this suggestion.\r"

Demented patients were older, had a later age at onset of motor manifestations, and a more rapid progression of physical disability than nondemented patients. Duration of illness and levodopa use and the presence of tremor or depression were similar in demented and nondemented patients. Demented patients more often responded poorly or developed adverse effects to levodopa than nondemented patients. When Parkinson's disease began after age 70 years, dementia was noted over three times more frequently than when the disease began at an earlier age. The age-specific prevalence rate of dementia for patients older than 70 years was more than twice that for younger patients. Moreover, the number of records with evidence for dementia with idiopathic Parkinson's disease was 3.75 times greater than expected in comparison with data from a study of the prevalence of dementia in the elderly.\r"

  ".W": "Although patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) generally have impairments in multiple areas of cognitive function, there are those patients who appear to have neuropsychological deficits more prominent in one domain than in other domains. We examined the neuropsychological status of 86 patients with probable AD and 92 elderly control subjects and identified the patterns of impairments in the patients with AD. Independent deficits of visuoconstructional and lexical/semantic abilities were identified in a subset of patients by a principal components analysis. Individual patients were identified who were predominantly impaired in one, but not the other, neuropsychological domain. There were no striking relationships between the demographic characteristics of the patients and their pattern of deficits at the initial evaluation. There were no significant differences in age at onset or rate of progression of dementia among patients with different patterns of cognitive dysfunction. A review of the results of this and other studies suggests that the language impairment in AD may be associated with two distinct neuropsychological abnormalities: a lexical/semantic impairment that is unrelated to onset or progression of symptoms, and a syntactic impairment that may be associated with earlier onset and more rapid progression of dementia.\r"

In healthy normal subjects, there was no significant correlation between age and either somatostatin or neuropeptide Y concentration. However, the concentrations of both peptides correlated significantly with each other. In patients with DAT and EDAT, the concentrations of somatostatin (17.5 +/- 5.0 and 16.4 +/- 5.0 pg/mL, respectively) were significantly reduced relative to age-matched control subjects (23.1 +/- 8.2 pg/mL) but were unrelated to dementia severity and did not change significantly during the progression of the disease. Neuropeptide Y concentrations did not differ significantly between the age-matched control, DAT, and EDAT groups (38.2 +/- 12.8, 37.0 +/- 12.3, and 30.3 +/- 7.8 pg/mL, respectively). These results suggest that in DAT, dysfunction of cortical somatostatin but not neuropeptide Y transmitter systems is reflected by reduced cerebrospinal fluid concentrations.\r"

Speed of information processing was evaluated with the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. The results for the two highest rates of presentation revealed significantly impaired processing in the MS group. Performance at the higher rates and retrieval of information from long-term memory were significantly correlated.

Following surgical treatment in 17 patients, progressive and episodic weakness disappeared and the majority of them (76.4%) became asymptomatic. However, the patients with stenosis at the siphon and those with progressive weakness from occlusion at the origin appeared to be at increased risk for cardiac death.\r"

Subcortical infarctions (n = 56) were found in all hemispheres. They were predominantly located in the centrum semiovale, in the distal beds of supply of the penetrating branches of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Infarction of the putamen was found in three hemispheres, caudate nucleus in four, globus pallidus in two, and anterior limb of the internal capsule in two. There were none in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, thalamus, brain stem, or cerebellum. Middle cerebral artery flow was visualized as a signal-void flow sign in only three hemispheres. Cerebral infarctions due to moyamoya are bilateral, multiple, often small, and asymptomatic, affecting predominantly the carotid circulation in watershed regions. Subcortical infarctions in the centrum semiovale and large hemispheric infarctions in hemodynamically compromised areas are the predominant findings.\r"

The former probably reflects diminished input from higher centers on an otherwise intact sympathetic nervous system.

Four months later he experienced acute visual blurring on the right side. Examination of the right eye at that time revealed a visual acuity of 3/200 and a central scotoma. There was swelling of the right optic disc. Three weeks after the onset of the visual loss, the acuity of the right eye spontaneously improved to 20/60, the field deficit lessened, and there was a decrease in the swelling of the optic disc. Subsequently, his neuro-ophthalmologic condition remained unchanged but his general health deteriorated, and he died nine months after the onset of the disease. Neuropathologic examination showed mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis of the meninges throughout the central nervous system, loss of neurons and gliosis in the third and fourth cranial nerve nuclei, perivascular inflammation and gliosis of the optic nerves, and chiasm and central demyelination of the right optic nerve. No tumor cells were seen. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of paraneoplastic optic neuritis and paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis. The present case confirms the existence of paraneoplastic optic neuritis and illustrates the clinical course of the disease.\r"

Gonioscopic examination to reveal peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) formation was performed before and six months after ALT. Peripheral anterior synechiae were found in 26 (22%) of the eyes. With 500-mW laser power and anterior trabecular meshwork burns, no PAS developed. With 800-mW posterior trabecular meshwork burns, PAS developed in 12 (40%) of the eyes. No correlation between PAS formation and sex, age, glaucoma type, preoperative antiglaucoma medication, pigmentation of the chamber angle, and visible burn effect was found. Intraocular pressure decrease after ALT was significantly smaller in eyes with PAS.\r"

Twenty-four of these trabeculectomy patients required a second surgery, and 8 required a third surgery. The results are presented using a survival analysis. The success rates at one year of follow-up for the first, second, and third trabeculectomies were 64%, 79%, and 63%, respectively. Patients subclassified as having Chandler's syndrome, essential iris atrophy, and Cogan-Reese syndrome responded with approximately the same success rates within the first two years following their first surgery. The success rates for repeated surgeries are comparable with those of initial surgery in patients with primary open angle glaucoma. On the basis of this study, further surgery is recommended despite initial failure in this group of difficult patients.\r"

The MRI and CT scans of three consecutive and histopathologically proved cases of pituitary apoplexy were reviewed. The MRI scans obtained at least five days after the onset of symptoms suggested pituitary apoplexy (hemorrhage) in all three cases, while CT scanning indicated pituitary hemorrhage in only one case. Increased signal on the T1-weighted image was the hallmark on MRI scans in all three cases. These findings suggest that MRI scanning may be superior to CT scanning in identifying pituitary apoplexy, at least in the subacute phase.\r"

The average increase between two weeks and three months was 1.31 D (SD, 0.9 D). To decrease this change, 15 eyes were semi-pressure patched at night and treated with topical steroids for four weeks following surgery. The average change between two weeks and three months in these eyes was 0.3 D (SD, 1.0 D). This retrospective study suggests that semi-pressure patching after surgery may be useful for eyes that are undercorrected or overcorrected by less than 1 D.\r"

In the heterozygote condition, arcuslike changes were present in some of the patients studied. We found the corneal change in the recessive state to be sensitive and specific as a marker of this condition. Heterozygotes appear to have a higher incidence of arcuslike corneal changes.\r"

In four patients, macular involvement was present, and they suffered visual loss. Two eyes of two patients progressed to large, bullous, exudative retinal detachments. In the three patients in whom control of the systemic disease was achieved, the serous detachments resolved. The pathogenesis is most likely related to choroidal vascular disease with resultant pigment epithelial damage and serous fluid leakage beneath the retina.\r"

Some investigators propose a transformation of choroidal melanocytes as the origin, and others suggest a histiomonocytic derivation. One reason this controversy exists may be the relative lack of investigations into necrotic changes of choroidal melanocytes. The structural alterations in the choroidal melanocytes of an injured eye with sympathetic ophthalmia were studied, and the sequence of events involved in degeneration and necrotic changes were elucidated. The damaged melanocytes developed vacuolation, and the melanin granules were gathered into autophagosomes or had disappeared. The nuclei of the severely damaged melanocytes became pyknotic. Degenerated cell nuclei were phagocytized by macrophages. It is concluded that choroidal melanocytes may not transform into epithelioid cells and that they disappear from the choroid following degeneration.\r"

The laser beam was shaped by a rotating slit to produce a circular ablation 7.5 mm in diameter, with a mathematically defined profile to correct myopia. The fluence at the surface of the cornea was 200 mJ/cm2; the laser was fired at 20 Hz. Each 4.5-mJ laser pulse etched a 0.17-micron deep image of the slit in the cornea. Since the slit moved (0.03 Hz), each successive pulse etched an area adjacent to the previous one, reducing damage from repetitive pulses striking the same area. The slit scanned the cornea many times and the summation of these individual ablations produced the smooth myopic ablation profile, as shown by computerized keratographs and light and electron microscopy.\r"

We examined freshly excised sheep corneas stained with alizarin red and trypan blue after exposure to two different concentrations of thrombin for four hours. The structure of the corneal endothelium appeared to be intact even after prolonged exposure to thrombin at concentrations of 100 and 1000 U/mL. Thrombin appears to be nontoxic to the corneal endothelium in this experimental model.\r"

Gentamicin concentration in the dialysate, after subconjunctival or intravitreal injection, was used to calculate gentamicin concentration in the vitreous from the catheter's recovery ratio, as calibrated in vitro. After subconjunctival injection, no gentamicin was detected in the vitreous for up to eight hours. From four to eight hours after intravitreal injection of approximately 100 micrograms of gentamicin sulfate, its vitreal concentration ranged from 30 to 80 mg/L and from nine to 16 hours it fell from 26 to 22 mg/L. This method may prove useful for the study of the pharmacokinetics of many drugs and metabolites in the eye.\r"

If residual detachment remains following fluid-gas exchange after preliminary placement of the retinal tacks, a given tack may be removed and reinserted to facilitate complete retinal reattachment. This utilitarian feature allows the surgeon to eliminate residual anteroposterior traction following complete membrane peeling by extending relaxing retinotomies and tacking the posterior cut edge of the retina securely between the ora serrata and the equator.\r"

Both favorable and unfavorable reports can be found in the literature. Some basic research concerning the rate and mechanism of resorption has been completed but has failed to resolve the issue of the usefulness of this material in day-to-day practice. One frequently cited reference concerning the use of irradiated homologous cartilage in reconstructive surgery was coauthored by two of the present investigators ten years ago. In an effort to place this study in a long-term perspective, we examined 42 of the original 107 patients who formed the initial population base. Sixty-two of the original 145 irradiated homologous cartilage grafts have been followed up for an average of nine years, with an average resorption rate of approximately 75%. Eighteen of 24 grafts followed up from 11 to 16 years completely resorbed. In spite of complete graft resorption, some patients have maintained satisfactory facial contour with fibrous tissue replacement of the cartilage.\r"

Two of the patients with microinvasive carcinoma were treated by hemilaryngectomy, three with stripping and radiation therapy, two with stripping alone, and two by radiation therapy. None of the patients developed recurrent disease after one to five years of follow-up. This observation supports the approach of treating \"true\" microinvasive carcinoma similar to carcinoma in situ. The 16 remaining patients were treated by stripping (ten patients), stripping and radiation therapy (four patients), and radiation therapy alone (two patients). Three patients progressed to invasive squamous carcinoma at 35, 39, and 84 months after the diagnosis of SIN III. Patients in this study displaying SIN III with or without microinvasive carcinoma were successfully treated by surgery or radiation therapy alone or by combined therapy. The finding of 12% progression to invasive carcinoma and coexisting microinvasive carcinoma in 36% confirms the preinvasive nature of SIN III of the laryngeal glottis.\r"

In addition, autonomic nerve regulation of laryngeal vessels was estimated under administration of succinylcholine chloride. Oxygen pressures of the vocal fold were measured in the lamina propria and vocal muscle at the middle of the membranous portion. The Pto2 in the lamina propria showed a slight increase during lower-frequency stimulation and a slight decrease during higher-frequency stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The Pto2 in the vocal muscle showed a decrease during stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. On the other hand, the Pto2 showed almost no change in the lamina propria or vocal muscle during stimulation of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. It is supposed that an ischemic change in the vocal muscle on phonation results mainly from contraction of the vocal muscle. On the contrary, the ischemic change in the vocal mucosa on phonation does not appear to be directly caused by the contraction of the vocal muscle but by other factors, such as wavelike movement.\r"

Although a great deal of clinical research has focused on the role of NK cells in the blood of patients with cancer, very little has been done to determine what role they may play at the regional or lymph node level. One hundred seven lymph nodes from 22 patients with head and neck cancer and eight control patients were assayed for NK cell cytotoxicity against the human erythroleukemia cell line K562. Six of these nodes contained a discrete intracapsular focus of metastatic tumor. Lymphocytes from these focally positive nodes exhibited a significant depression of NK cell cytotoxicity compared with all other nodes. These data suggest that the presence of metastatic tumor inhibits NK cell function at the regional level in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

The findings of histologic and ultrastructural evaluations of this neoplasm suggested a salivary duct cell origin. The tumor appears to arise from cells of the salivary duct system that differentiate into cells with either neuroendocrine or epithelial features. Electron microscopy to determine the type of small-cell carcinoma should be performed, as this may have prognostic significance. Aggressive therapy should be undertaken, since small-cell carcinomas of the major salivary glands appear to have a better prognosis than bronchogenic or laryngeal small-cell carcinomas have.\r"

Parotid gland enlargement was bilateral in seven patients (78%), slightly painful in seven patients (78%), and painless in two patients (22%). No evidence of inflammation was observed around Stensen's duct. One of the two patients in whom a parotid gland biopsy was performed had a malignant lymphoma of the large-cell, histiocytic type. In the other patient, the parotid gland showed normal morphology with minor inflammation. Among 284 adults and 40 children with symptomatic HIV infection, chronic parotid gland enlargement was observed in none of the patients. However, two (0.7%) of the adults presented with an acute pyogenic parotitis. Further studies are needed to determine whether parotid gland enlargement is associated with HIV infection.\r"

Accepted therapy for differentiated macroscopic (greater than 1 to 1.5 cm) lesions is total or near-total thyroidectomy, followed by radioactive iodine treatment. Followup care usually consists of annual total body scan to rule out the presence of metastatic disease. Thyroglobulin, which is elaborated only by thyroid cells, either normal or metastatic, serves as a tumor marker when all functioning tissue has been ablated. The routine use of thyroglobulin assays obviates the expense and inconvenience of an annual scan. This article reviews the usefulness and limitations of serum radioimmune assays in the postoperative management of differentiated thyroid cancer. We also present several representative cases treated at our institution.\r"

T1 maps were constructed from transverse and coronal images at various times after infarction. Thrombolytic treatment had been successful in 28 patients. Thirty three of the 34 patients studied within two weeks of infarction had a significantly increased T1 value but this developed only after the third day in four. At day 1-3 the mean (1 SD) maximum T1 was 413 (29) ms (n = 23) compared with 430 (41) ms (n = 22) at day 4-7, 433 (35) ms (n = 24) at day 8-14, 420 (34) at one month (n = 22), 388 (39) (n = 20) at three months, and 361 (24) (n = 14) at six months. The number of regions of interest with an increased T1 followed a similar time course. Although the increase in T1 measured at three months correlated with the initial maximum creatine kinase and with the left ventricular ejection fraction measured at one month, the number of regions with abnormal T1 from day 4 through to one month correlated best with left ventricular ejection fraction. There was no significant difference in T1 between patients with or without reperfusion. The rise in T1 over the first few days together with the prolonged time course of T1 increase suggests that the increase in T1 may reflect cellular infiltration as much or more than tissue oedema.\r"

Right ventricular volume was measured frame by frame from digitised ventriculograms by a modification of Simpson's rule. The accuracy of this method was tested in a study of 22 human and animal right ventricular casts. There was excellent agreement between calculated volumes and those measured by fluid displacement. The derived regression equations were used to correct right ventricular volumes calculated from in vivo studies. The mean (SD) end diastolic volume index for the group was 62 (13) ml/m2, the stroke volume index was 43 (8) ml/m2, and the ejection fraction was 62 (6)%. Right ventricular pressure-volume loops were generated by combining simultaneous volume and pressure curves. The normal right ventricular pressure-volume loop was triangular, departing significantly from the square or rectangle of the normal left ventricular pressure-volume loop. Ejection from the right ventricle began early during the pressure rise and continued as right ventricular pressure fell. As a result phases of isovolumic contraction and relaxation were difficult to define. These observations show that normal right ventricular pressure-volume relations differ considerably from those of the normal left ventricle, presumably reflecting the different loading conditions of the two ventricles.\r"

In eleven patients with normal coronary arteriograms, negative exercise tests, and no ST segment depression on the electrocardiogram, an increase in the rate of atrial pacing transiently decreased coronary sinus oxygen saturation but within 20 s oxygen saturation returned to the control value. In six patients with coronary artery disease ST segment depression developed during atrial pacing. The coronary sinus oxygen saturation fell and remained reduced until pacing was discontinued. The size of the fall of coronary sinus oxygen saturation increased with increasing heart rate. In seven patients with coronary artery disease the ST segments were unaltered during atrial pacing and coronary sinus oxygen saturation did not fall. Ten patients with syndrome X were studied. In six ST segment depression developed on atrial pacing. In five, three of whom developed ST segment depression, the changes in coronary sinus oxygen saturation during atrial pacing were similar to those observed in patients without any evidence of coronary artery disease. In three, all of whom developed ST segment depression, coronary sinus oxygen saturation gradually increased throughout the period of atrial pacing. In two patients coronary sinus oxygen saturation fell in a manner similar to that observed in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease who developed ST segment depression on pacing. Thus regulation of coronary blood flow in normal persons in response to an increase of heart rate is rapid. Oxygen extraction across the coronary bed can increase by up to 30% and a persistent increase in oxygen extraction is an indicator of myocardial ischaemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No relation could be established between the occurrence of late potentials or fractionations and clinical or induced arrhythmias. Endomyocardial biopsy samples were taken from 20 patients and showed that reduced myofibril volume fraction was related to the occurrence of abnormal endocardial electrograms. Neither induced arrhythmias nor the presence of late potentials or fractionations identified patients who died of sudden cardiac death during the mean (SD) follow up of 33 (11) months. Thus abnormal endocardial electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy may only be interpreted as being a sign of damage to the myocardial cells.\r"

First degree atrioventricular block and left anterior hemiblock were the most commonly encountered abnormalities in patients with mild and moderate disease, whereas atrial fibrillation and flutter, abnormal Q waves, and repolarisation abnormalities were more common in patients with severe disease. This study shows that the heart is often affected by myotonic dystrophy. These effects can be detected by electrocardiography in early and mild forms of the disease.

  ".W": "A survey of infective endocarditis in the North East Thames Regional Health Authority was carried out over a period of 30 months from 1982 to 1984. The incidence, clinical characteristics, and in-hospital mortality were studied. Important causes of endocarditis were dental treatment, the presence of dental disease, drug abuse, and cytoscopy. The omission or incorrect administration of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with valve disease was noted, but failure of correctly prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis was not recorded. Adverse prognostic features were increased age, prosthetic valve infection, Gram negative or staphylococcal infections, and aortic valve involvement. In contrast, mortality was lower in patients with mitral valve prolapse, ventricular septal defect, and streptococcus viridans infection. Deaths were usually attributable to irreversible complications present at the time of diagnosis. Vegetations were detected on the echocardiogram in half of those studied and mortality was higher in those with vegetations than without. Operation for native valve infection was associated with a low mortality and it is likely that the overall mortality for infective endocarditis has been improved by surgical intervention.\r"

Despite a low mortality, coronary angioplasty is associated with major complications in about one of 14 procedures; the complication is usually acute myocardial infarction caused by occlusion of the vessel.\r"

Preliminary clinical studies have shown that the technique can also be used with safety in human beings, and in the present study its effectiveness was assessed in three patients undergoing repeated coronary artery occlusions during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Arterial blood was removed via an 8F catheter positioned in the femoral artery and delivered by a retroperfusion pumping system to a 7F retroperfusion balloon catheter positioned in the anterior cardiac vein. Ischaemia-related indices were monitored both before and during coronary sinus retroperfusion. These indices included high fidelity left ventricular pressure recordings and pressure derived indices (including velocities of isovolumic contraction and relaxation), as well as electrocardiographic changes and symptoms. Analysis of these variables showed that the ischaemic changes induced during coronary artery occlusion were not prevented by this type of coronary sinus retroperfusion. There was no major complication in any of the patients. It may be that adaptation of the technique or the use of alternative end points will establish a benefit, but further modifications of the delivery system are necessary for effective clinical use.\r"

  ".W": "The delivery of laser energy to the coronary circulation by bare optical fibres may cause perforation of the vessel. Experimental studies have shown that this complication can be avoided if the optical fibre is fitted with a metal cap to prevent the potentially dangerous forward projection of the laser beam. This study was performed to assess the feasibility and short term effects of percutaneous coronary laser recanalisation with these modified fibres. Recanalisation of a severe stenosis of the left anterior descending artery was attempted in six patients who were referred for coronary artery bypass grafting. Although the percutaneous technique was used, the laser procedure was performed during coronary bypass surgery before the start of cardiopulmonary bypass to minimise the effects of potential complications. A 1.5 mm diameter metal-capped fibre coupled to an argon laser was advanced percutaneously over a guide wire positioned across the stenosis. In the first patient the delivery of 152 J resulted in the gradual passage of the fibre through a 3 cm long stenosis. Repeat angiography showed a reduction in the severity of the stenosis. In the second patient the delivery of 112 J failed to allow fibre advancement; a further 80 J pulse caused perforation which was repaired. In the remaining four patients the delivery of laser energy in the attempt to traverse the stenosis was limited to less than 90 J. In two of the four patients the severity of stenosis was reduced. No further complications were seen. Percutaneous coronary laser recanalisation with metal-capped optical fibres is feasible but improvements of currently available technology are needed to increase the primary success rate.\r"

The applicability and comparability of enzyme tests for the estimation of myocardial injury were studied in 76 control patients and 74 patients treated with streptokinase. Treatment with streptokinase caused a considerable acceleration of enzyme release after acute myocardial infarction, both in patients with persistent coronary occlusion and in those with successful reperfusion. But this changed pattern of enzyme release did not affect the rate of enzyme elimination from plasma or the released proportions of different enzymes. Thus the assessment of infarct size by measurement of these enzyme activities can also be applied to patients treated with streptokinase. Moreover, the enzymes measured in the present study are all equally valid markers of myocardial injury.\r"

One hundred and four patients with neither of these characteristics were at lower risk of a cardiac event than the 19 patients with both of these characteristics. The percentages of patients in these two groups without a cardiac event after one year were 98.1 and 78.8 respectively.

In six patients (8%), a total of 12 episodes of ventricular fibrillation and 16 episodes of ventricular tachycardia were initiated by supraventricular extrasystoles. Ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia were initiated by single supraventricular extrasystoles in 16 and by salvos greater than or equal to two beats in 12 episodes. The RR coupling interval of the supraventricular impulse immediately preceding ventricular tachycardia ranged from 240 to 420 ms (mean 356 (62)) and was characteristic of R-on-T (prematurity index less than 1) in 63% of episodes. Average peak serum creatine kinase activity in the six patients in whom ventricular tachycardia was initiated by a supraventricular extrasystole was 1275 units compared with 720 units in the remaining 66 patients. Five of these six patients later showed evidence of pump failure. Lignocaine or procainamide or both suppressed the ventricular arrhythmia in five of the six patients. The initiation of ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia by supraventricular extrasystoles in acute myocardial infarction is not uncommon and may reflect the increased vulnerability of the heart after a large infarct. These arrhythmias may respond to drugs that suppress ventricular irritability.\r"

A total of 35 acute thrombi were found in the 24 hearts. Platelet/fibrin microemboli were found in 19 (79%) hearts. Eighteen patients died in hospital. The hearts of 16 of these cases showed microemboli; 16 had important arrhythmias or various forms of heart block; 13 showed acute pathological changes in the conduction system. Fourteen of the deaths in hospital were primarily the result of cardiogenic shock and four were primarily caused by arrhythmia. Six of the deaths that occurred before admission to hospital were regarded as being arrhythmic in origin. Three of these showed microemboli and the other three had acute pathological changes in the conduction system. Microemboli were found in two (24%) of 12 control hearts. Coronary thrombosis was found in most deaths caused by acute myocardial infarction and platelet/fibrin microemboli were present in the majority of such hearts.

The prevalence of electrocardiographic evidence of ischaemia was similar in the two communities--8.7% of men aged 45-49 years rising to 18.6% in men aged 55-59 years in the samples from South Wales, and 8.0% and 17.2% respectively in the Bristol population.

The data, however, suggested that the overall prevalence of ischaemic heart disease was very similar in the two areas. The prevalence of ischaemic heart disease was compared with that found in other population studies carried out in the United Kingdom and was higher than that found when employed men only were studied. There were substantial differences in mortality between the two areas; possible reasons for this are differences in community or medical services, smoking habit, or unemployment rates.\r"

A curve of equation y = ax-bx2 was used to model the relation between the rate of oxygen consumption (y axis) and the rate of carbon dioxide production (x axis). The constants \"a\" and \"b\" were used to calculate the maximal value of the expression ax-bx2. This value was termed the \"extrapolated maximal oxygen consumption\". For all subjects a close fit between experimental data and mathematical model was obtained and the values of the measured maximal rate of oxygen consumption and \"extrapolated maximal oxygen consumption\" were similar. Respiratory gas exchange was reanalysed using only those values obtained during the first 90%, 75%, and 66% of exercise. In contrast with the value for the measured rate of oxygen consumption, the value of \"extrapolated maximal oxygen consumption\" was effectively independent of exercise duration. Extrapolated maximal oxygen consumption provides an objective measure of cardiorespiratory functional reserve that, within limits, is independent of exercise duration. Extrapolated maximal oxygen consumption is complementary to the direct measurement of the maximal rate of oxygen consumption and increases the amount of information derived from a single exercise test.\r"

In the six remaining patients mobilisation of friable calcific deposits (1 case), slight tearing of the commissure (4 cases), or tearing of the aortic ring (1 case) were seen. Dilatation did not appear to alter valvar rigidity. In 14 patients (group 2) the haemodynamic gradient across the aortic valve was measured before and immediately after dilatation and one week after the procedure. Dilatation produced an immediate significant decrease of the aortic mean gradient and a significant increase of the aortic valve area. Eight days later the mean gradient had increased and the aortic valve area had decreased. Nevertheless there was a significant difference between the initial gradient and the gradient eight days after dilatation. The initial aortic valve area was also significantly larger than the area eight days after dilatation. The aortic valve gradient rose significantly in the eight days after dilatation and at follow up the gradients were those of severe aortic stenosis.\r"

Plasma noradrenaline concentration was higher in group 2B than in the other groups. When end systolic wall stress was greater than 12 g/cm2 this variable showed a significant inverse linear relation with fractional shortening before isoproterenol infusion. The inotropic response to isoproterenol was measured as the increase of fractional shortening corrected for the decrease of end systolic wall stress (delta fractional shortening/--delta end systolic wall stress). The mean (SD) change in delta fractional shortening/--delta end systolic wall stress was significantly larger in group 1 (1.40 (0.60) cm2/g) than in group 2A (0.85 (0.39) cm2/g), and was significantly larger in group 2A than in group 2B (0.56 (0.15) cm2/g). In patients with hypertensive hypertrophy with subnormal end systolic wall stress (inappropriate hypertrophy) the beta adrenergic response is increased; in hypertensive hypertrophy with normal end systolic wall stress (appropriate hypertrophy), however, it is normal, or becomes reduced as plasma noradrenaline increases.\r"

Treatment shortly after elicitation of the dermatitis, and for up to 5 days thereafter, was moderately effective in suppressing DNFB-induced ear swelling in a dose-dependent fashion. Daily pre-treatment of the ears for 1 week caused a more marked reduction of DNFB-induced ear swelling during the first 48 h after elicitation. No reduction, but rather an increase in ear swelling was observed with croton oil-induced dermatitis. These results indicate that peptidoleukotrienes play a role in the early stages of elicitation of murine allergic, but not irritant contact dermatitis and that a specific receptor antagonist can only partially reverse the effect of peptidoleukotrienes once the dermatitis is established.\r"

  ".W": "Nail infections caused by Candida species are normally associated with chronic paronychia or chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMCC). However, the role of Candida in the pathogenesis of other primary nail dystrophies has been questioned in view of their response to antifungal therapy alone. In the present study of 86 patients with primary nail dystrophies from which Candida was isolated, three patterns of nail involvement were found. Nineteen patients, of whom 17 had CMCC, had total dystrophic onychomycosis of at least two nails. The second group consisted of 27 patients with paronychia and lateral onycholysis. In a further 40 patients, who did not have paronychia, Candida was isolated from nails showing primary distal and lateral onycholysis. These changes were mainly seen in patients with peripheral vascular disease, particularly Raynaud's disease, or Cushing's syndrome. Nail biopsies from patients in the latter two groups confirmed the presence of yeasts and mycelium in the nail plate and 17 (46%) of those receiving antifungal therapy with ketoconazole or itraconazole showed complete clearance of the nail dystrophy. Good responses to therapy were seen more frequently in patients with peripheral vascular disease or Cushing's syndrome of whom 15 (72%) recovered; distal erosion of the nail plate, mycelium in the nail plate on biopsy or direct microscopy together with the isolation of C. albicans were all associated with good responses to antifungals. In addition to patients with CMCC or paronychia, therefore, Candida appears to be a significant pathogen in some patients with primary onycholysis of the finger nails, particularly where there is underlying peripheral vascular disease or Cushing's syndrome.\r"

A significant parity difference in MAP and contraction frequency was observed in the first stage but not in the second stage. Epidural analgesia did not appear to influence uterine activity in the first stage but was associated with a lower MAP, contraction frequency and intensity in the second stage. During the first stage, MAP increased by 21% in nulliparas and by 39% in multiparas. The rise in MAP was mainly due to an increase in contraction frequency.\r"

In normal fetuses the ratio between the E velocity (early passive ventricular filling) and the A velocity (active ventricular filling during atrial contraction) increased progressively during pregnancy in both transmitral and transtricuspid waveforms, approaching 1 at term. In SGA fetuses, the E/A ratios did not increase during pregnancy and the values obtained were significantly lower than in normal fetuses. The ratio between the transtricuspid and transmitral mean temporal velocities remained almost constant throughout pregnancy in the normal fetuses with transtricuspid velocity slightly exceeding the transmitral velocity. On the other hand, in SGA fetuses the ratio between the mean temporal velocities was inversed with the transmitral velocity progressively greater than the transtricuspid velocity suggesting the existence of intracardiac haemodynamic changes in these fetuses.\r"

The lung is the most common site of metastases. This paper reviews 97 patients with pulmonary metastasis developing after gestational trophoblastic disease who were seen at one centre over 26 years. Most patients had an antecedent molar pregnancy but an associated choriocarcinomatous lesion in the uterus was absent in the majority. In many patients the pulmonary lesion was asymptomatic. Whilst chemotherapy was the treatment of choice, selective thoracotomy in cases with solitary lung nodules reduced the treatment time and need for aggressive multi-drug combination regimens. The overall survival rate at 2 years after diagnosis was 65%. A higher mortality was found when the antecedent pregnancy ended at term, when the time interval between the preceding pregnancy and diagnosis of pulmonary metastases was greater than 1 year, when multiple pulmonary secondaries were present or when cerebral metastases occurred. The main causes of death were cerebral haemorrhage, respiratory failure and pulmonary embolism.\r"

The tissue response around the silicone rubber tube was that of simple fibroblastic activity. Around the implant, however, there was fibrous tissue in which necrotic cell debris was prominent. No significant inflammation was observed in this tissue, but the choroid beneath the implant showed a focal inflammatory cell infiltrate. The morphology suggests that the tissue around all surfaces of the implant (450 mm2) is exposed to aqueous, which seems to have a toxic effect on the encapsulating connective tissue. The changes seen in the tissue exposed to draining aqueous are similar to those described in experimental studies of the effect of aqueous on cell growth in tissue culture.\r"

The CSF was characterised by its peak value (the maximal sensitivity, Smax, and the spatial frequency at which Smax occurs, Frmax) calculated by a single peak least-square regression method. The two amblyopic groups showed discrepancies in relationship of both Smax and Frmax versus visual acuity both initially and during treatment. The strabismic cases had a more marked visual acuity deficit in relation to the contrast sensitivity losses, whereas these parameters are affected similarly in anisometropic amblyopes. The relationship between recovery of visual acuity and CSF during the initial month of occlusion treatment was of prognostic significance for the outcome of visual acuity improvement.\r"

The mean cell area obtained by this method correlated well (r = 0.9335) with that obtained by tracing the same images. This apparatus is clinically useful for immediately obtaining the mean cell area of corneal endothelium and will extend the application of specular microscopy to the routine clinical setting.\r"

Thus, rheumatoid arthritis produces functional impairment that is not simply related to the severity of the disease process. Two-thirds of patients are concerned more with potential loss of function than with discomfort. There is, therefore, a need to assess disability separately from inflammatory activity. The principles of disability measurement concern assessment of performance of everyday activities. Global measures or the performance of one or more specific activities can be used to assess aspects of mobility and manual dexterity. Activities can be related to social life and employment and can include assessment of psychological as well as physical disability. Many different tools are available and can be divided into: 1. Measures depending on clinical judgement. 2. Measures based on observed patient performance. 3. Measures depending on patients' opinions. In addition, a variety of health status measures have been described that include disability as one of a number of parameters aimed to assess the overall impact of the disease on the patient. Evaluation of these tools has been patchy. Full assessment using measurement theory (validity, simplicity, reliability and sensitivity) has not been undertaken for any index. However, the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) have both been tested fairly extensively in North America. The choice of a particular measurement tool depends on: 1. The context in which it will be used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Flow rates were proportional to creatinine clearance (r = 0.73; r = 0.8) and decreased with falling clearance, although significant diuresis (4 ml/min/kidney) was achieved down to single kidney clearances of 10 ml/min. Where single kidney clearances were less than 31 ml/min, single kidney flow rates of 10 ml/min or more were not guaranteed. Below this clearance, diuresis renography remains completely reliable and unequivocal in the majority of cases. However, perfusion pressure flow studies will not necessarily be urodynamically comparable and it should not be expected that the results of the two tests will agree in individual cases of upper tract dilatation. Recommended timing for frusemide administration should be 20 min into the test, or 15 min before radiopharmaceutical injection.\r"

All three methods caused upper urinary tract dilatation and an obstructive nephropathy which had not resolved 96 h after dilatation. Histology at 24 h showed destruction of the transitional epithelium, with inflammation throughout the ureteric wall. Four weeks after dilatation the ureter was still dilated and urothelial nests were seen in the lamina propria and in the muscle coats.

This technique is recommended for the control of severe bleeding from the bladder or prostate in the seriously ill patient.\r"

Forty of 44 patients treated remain free of disease with a median follow-up of 21 months and actuarial disease free survival at 2 years of 91%. There have been no respiratory problems attributable to bleomycin lung toxicity in this study compared with four (3 associated with patient deaths) seen in 91 previously treated patients. The relatively low toxicity and high efficacy of this regime indicate that it may be suitable as adjuvant treatment.\r"

Specifically, increases in price through taxation, anti-smoking messages, restrictions on smoking behaviour and increased public pressure are effective in reducing smoking. Serious joint efforts in the area of public policy should be pursued to control the effects of this hazardous practice in Canada.\r"

Analysis of the reported consumption of foods selected for their fat or carotene content showed no clear distinction in dietary factors between the ER-negative and ER-positive groups. Frequent consumption of meat fats generally increased the risk of both ER-negative and ER-positive tumours; there were no clear trends in risk associated with vegetable consumption for either ER group. Fish was the only item affecting the risk for ER-negative and ER-positive tumours differently, frequent consumption reducing the risk for the former (p = 0.02). The results do not support the hypothesis that ER status influences the relation between dietary fat consumption and risk of breast cancer.\r"

There was no toxicity. Antibody and/or cellular immune responses to melanoma were induced more frequently in Stage II (36 patients [69%]) than Stage III (19 patients [53%]) disease. The ability of different immunization schedules, alum, or pretreatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide to potentiate immunogenicity was compared after 2 months of immunization. Immunization biweekly with a fixed intermediate dose of vaccine was more immunogenic than immunization weekly with escalating vaccine doses. Alum increased the intensity of cellular responses slightly, whereas pretreatment with cyclophosphamide augmented both the incidence and intensity of cellular immune responses slightly. However, these changes did not reach statistical significance. There was a reciprocal relationship between the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses. These results show that (1) active immunotherapy with a polyvalent melanoma vaccine is safe in patients with minimal disease, (2) the vaccine augments immunity to melanoma in many, but not all, patients, and (3) several immunization strategies failed to potentiate immunogenicity significantly.\r"

IU three times per week of a recombinant IFN-alpha 2b (rIFN-alpha 2b). All patients were examined for systemic and local responses to this treatment. The systemic responses consisted of nine objective remissions, each of which lasted from 2 to 18 or more months. There were 24 complete or partial local responses. Forty-two of the 51 patients had at least two skin metastases so that IFN-injected and noninjected tumor sites could be compared. The difference between systemic and local efficacy was highly significant statistically (P = 0.0004).

These changes were not well correlated with histologic signs of anaplasia or infiltration, nor with other biologic properties of tumor cells such as the expression of blood group antigens (ABH). However, a practical utility of TAg in the study of bladder tumors, is suggested by the analysis of those biopsies with low-grade low-stage tumors, on which the abnormal expression of TAg was more discriminatory than the ABH changes in defining those patients suffering tumors with a particular aggressiveness. Circulating antibody titer was also investigated in 20 patients but all of them displayed titers in the normal range, with independence of the results observed in their corresponding bladder biopsies.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six consecutive patients with nonmetastatic inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), were treated in a single institution using the same protocol, and all were followed for at least 48 months. The first phase of treatment consisted of two monthly cycles of combination chemotherapy with Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), vincristine, cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil. Local treatment was then undertaken using in all cases a cobalt 60 beam to deliver 45 Gy to the entire mammary gland and lymph-draining areas. Local treatment was completed either by mastectomy, or by conservation of the breast and interstitial irradiation of the primary tumor site. Chemotherapy was resumed after completion of local treatment for a total of 6 cycles. Metastatic disease occurred in 19 of 26 patients from 8 to 55 months; five patients are alive and free of disease from 48 to 81 months. Failure to control local disease or local recurrences was noted in two of ten patients undergoing mastectomy, and in seven of 13 patients with conservation of the breast. While this difference is not statistically significant we concluded that methods of breast conservation which limit the high dose volume to the tumor site do not assure local control in IBC. The median disease-free survival and overall survival of 12 and 31 months, respectively, are not satisfactory. Better systemic treatment is needed.\r"

The results have been correlated with drug sensitivities of the tumors in vivo. The chemosensitivity in vitro of eight patients with CLL was observed for 12 to 42 months. In 44 cases the assay correctly predicted seven sensitive and 30 resistant tumors (84% positive correlations). There were six false predictions of sensitivity and one false prediction of resistance. Repeated testing of patients receiving treatment revealed significant and progressive development of drug resistance, while serial tests on untreated patients with CLL gave unaltered results. The development of cross-resistance to structurally related drugs was observed after treatment and many samples showed a high level of cross-resistance. However, teniposide showed greater activity than etoposide, and mitoxantrone showed greater activity than the anthracyclines. The high level of agreement between laboratory and clinical results suggests that the DiSC assay may have a useful place (1) in guiding the clinician in the selection of drugs for chemotherapy and (2) in giving an added indication of prognosis for an individual with a lymphatic neoplasm.\r"

  ".U": "88135551\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred fifty-nine patients with unresectable but localized pancreatic cancer, as defined at exploratory laparotomy, were treated at the Mayo Clinic between February 1974 to April 1985. Postoperative therapy consisted of 4000 to 6000 cGy external beam irradiation (XRT) alone in 122 patients or 4500 to 5500 cGy XRT in combination with an intraoperative electron boost in 37. In addition, 132 (both groups) received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy. Local control (LC) at 1 year was 82% with XRT + intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) versus 48% with XRT and 66% versus 20% at 2 years respectively (P less than 0.0005). Due to the high incidence of hematogenous and/or peritoneal spread in both groups (abdominal failure in 54 and 56% of patients at risk), the decreased frequency of local progression did not translate into an improved survival. Neither median nor long-term survival of the two treatment groups (XRT versus XRT + IORT) was statistically different (median 12.6 months versus 13.4 months, P = 0.25). With tumor arising in the head of the pancreas, survival at 2 years was 18% as opposed to 0% for other locations (P less than 0.01). On the basis of a Cox multivariate analysis, no other treatment or prognostic factor significantly altered survival. Until the problem with systemic failure (usually abdominal) can be resolved, the median and long-term survival of patients with pancreatic carcinoma is likely to remain unchanged. Since IORT appears to improve local control, we will continue to utilize IORT in phase 1, 2 studies which also attempt to decrease the incidence of abdominal failures. Even with IORT + XRT combinations, the incidence of local progression is excessive and radiation dose modifiers need to be evaluated.\r"

Twenty-two percent had stage I or II and 78% Stage III or IV had lesions. Two hundred twenty-Kv radiographs were used before 1960; and telecobalt was used from 1961 to 1978. Factors influencing the 5-year survival rate favorably are youth of patient, being female, pathologic condition (poorly differentiated carcinoma, 45.1% versus adenocarcinoma, 13%), stage (Stage I, 86%, Stage II, 59.5%; Stage III, 45.8%; Stage IV, 29.2%), decade admitted for treatment in the past (31% in the 1950s, 48.6% in the 1970s), total dose delivered to the nasopharynx (40 to 49 Gy, 46%; 70 to 79 Gy, 54.1%; 90 Gy or more, 64%) and prophylactic radiation to the neck regions (with prophylactic irradiation, 53.8%, without prophylactic irradiation, 23%). This implies that prophylactic radiation of the neck is crucial even without positive clinical metastasis. For those who have a residual tumor in the primary site when 70 Gy has been delivered, the total dose may be boosted to more than 90 Gy with the cone-down technique or on basis of adding 20 Gy to the dose at which the primary lesion disappeared grossly. The common postirradiation complications are: radiation myelitis, trismus, and otitis media. Because disease recurred in some patients after the fifth year, NPC patients should be followed for at least 10 years.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of carbohydrate moieties was detected in tissue sections of human breast by employing two types of labeled ligands: neoglycoproteins (chemically glycosylated, histochemically inert carrier protein) and desialylated naturally occurring glycoproteins. Paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed sections from 40 benign and malignant breast lesions were examined for the presence and distribution of endogenous sugar receptors, employing a panel of 13 biotinylated neoglycoproteins, representing carbohydrates commonly found in naturally occurring glycoconjugates, and four biotinylated glycoproteins. Benign and malignant breast lesions revealed staining with mannosylated carrier neoglycoprotein in comparison to normal breast. A mixed pattern of staining localization and intensity was seen for different types of malignancy with this neoglycoprotein. Similarly, receptors for lactose and N-acetylglucosamine could only be detected within the cytoplasm for certain types of malignancy. Their nuclear localization, however, could also be seen in normal breast specimens. The extent of staining with different glycoproteins, containing different types of galactoside-terminal sugar chains, also appeared to differ between various types of breast cancer. The detection of endogenous sugar receptors by neoglycoproteins is proposed to contribute to an understanding of malignancy-associated alterations in the structure of their potential physiological ligands, the glycoconjugates. Changes in the structure and abundance of such glycoconjugates have commonly been detected with the use of plant lectins in histopathologic studies.\r"

  ".U": "88135554\r", 
  ".W": "Treating human melanoma lines with dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (dbc AMP) resulted in morphologic changes associated with the altered expression of cell surface antigens. After treatment, cells developed long cellular projections characteristic of mature melanocytes and showed the presence of an increased number of Stage II premelanosomes. In addition, induction of melanin synthesis, detected as brown perinuclear pigmentation, was observed. The AMP further drastically reduced the growth rate of the five melanoma cell lines that were tested. The influence of dbc AMP was completely reversible 3 days after the agent was removed from the culture medium. The antigenic phenotype of the melanoma lines was compared before and after dbc AMP treatment. This was done with four monoclonal antibodies directed against major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and II antigens and 11 monoclonal antibodies defining eight different melanoma-associated antigenic systems. Treatment with dbc AMP reduced the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-ABC antigens and beta-2-microglobulin in five of five melanoma lines. In the two HLA-DR-positive cell lines dbc AMP reduced the expression of this antigen in one line and enhanced it in the other. No induction of HLA-DR or HLA-DC antigens was observed in the Class II negative cell lines. Furthermore, dbc-AMP modulated the expression of the majority of the melanoma antigenic systems tested. The expression of a 90-kilodalton (KD) antigen, which has been found to be upregulated by interferon-gamma, was markedly decreased in all the five cell lines. A similar decrease in the expression of the high molecular weight proteoglycan-associated antigen (220-240 KD) was observed. The reduced expression of Class I and II MHC antigens as well as the altered expression of the melanoma-associated antigens studied were shown to be reversible after dbc AMP was removed. Our results collectively show that the monoclonal antibody-defined melanoma-associated molecules are linked to differentiation. They could provide useful tools for monitoring the maturation of melanomas in vivo induced by chemical agents or natural components favoring differentiation.\r"

Invasive lobular, mucoid, and tubular carcinomas rather than ductal carcinomas were ER-positive more frequently in ER-ICA. Medullary and papillary carcinomas had corresponding lower or higher ER positivity, respectively, by both methods. The correlation of histologic grade and its single factors with ER status was statistically significant by both methods. Lymphocytic reaction to tumor showed a significant inverse relationship to ER status by both methods. A statistically significant higher number of ER-positive carcinomas in ER-ICA and dextran-coated charcoal assay (DCC) occurred when elastic tissue was present. Different associations were found between stromal content, tumor diameter, and ER status in DCC and ER-ICA, respectively.\r"

The presence of copper (demonstrated by rhodanine) and of copper-binding protein (demonstrated by modified orcein) was simultaneously observed in 11 of the 39 hepatocellular carcinomas (28%). Deposition was mild in three cases, moderate in two cases, and marked in six cases, and it was significantly related to the presence of bile within the tumor. Copper and copper-binding protein granules were not found in metastatic tumors of the liver, and were observed in two of the eight cases of benign hepatic tumors. These results suggest that the presence of copper and copper-binding protein in tumor cells may be found in all variants of hepatocellular carcinomas and not only in fibrolamellar carcinomas as previously suggested, and might be helpful in differentiating primary from secondary liver tumors.\r"

In patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma the serum NSE remained within normal limits (5.5 +/- 1.7 ng/ml; range, 3.9 to 8.2 ng/ml).

The best treatment for patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors (EGCT) remains a problem. In our series of 12 patients, important clinical features were related to the site of bulky tumor, and all patients exhibited sharply elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG), and/or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Each patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy, and ten were treated with the same combination chemotherapy--cyclophosphamide, actinomycin, vinblastine, bleomycin, and cisplatin (VAB) alternating with VP-16 and vincristine (VV). Of these ten patients, five died of progressive disease, three of whom had brain metastases. The other five are alive and clinically free of disease. The addition of VP-16 and vincristine did not improve responses. Advanced disease at presentation contributes to the poorer prognosis for these patients. Earlier diagnosis and surgical debulking may improve the long-term survival of patients with this disease.\r"

This group has a much better than the second group of tumors, which have either a large number of granular cells with field or a sarcomatoid or stratified pattern. It was also observed that for prognostic evaluation the histologic pattern was a better parameter than size and cytologic grading.\r"

Eighty patients (27%) presented with what was histologically determined to be occult groin metastases. Rosenmuller's node was involved in 30 of these cases; in the remaining 50, however, it was not affected; that is, 63% of the cases were false-negative. Thus, the involvement of Rosenmuller's node is not representative of metastases in the other ilioinguinal lymph nodes, but is rather a matter of chance. In women with superficial spreading melanoma the rate of occult lymph node metastases was significantly lower than that in men with melanomas of the other type. Iliac lymph node involvement was observed in 18 patients (22%) depending on clinical stage and depth of invasion of the primary tumor.\r"

In contrast, therapeutic control of the thrombocytosis caused all complications to disappear. These findings point out the danger of the natural course of the illness and justify active therapy.

In histologic terms, sinusoid, paracortical, and diffuse lymph node involvement by lymphoma was evident in each case. Both cases of immunoblastic lymphoma were T11+, T10+, T9+, HLA/Dr+, Tac+, Ki-1+, LCA+, and EMA+, while the lage neoplastic cells of the other case were T11+, Ki-1+, and LCA+. In all three cases DNA analysis of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes as well as T-cell receptor beta- and gamma-chain genes showed only germline patterns. The patients were treated with multi-agent chemotherapy.

Tumors from women less than 40 years of age were found to be ER negative (ERN) predominantly. Tumors from women greater than 40 years of age demonstrated increasingly higher median values for ER protein and were ER positive (ERP) predominantly except for those presenting among nonobese women 45 to 49 years of age and obese women 50 to 54 years of age. Tumors from these two subgroups were more frequently ERN than those from women of similar habitus who were immediately younger (P less than 0.05) or older (P less than 0.02), or than those from women of the same age and differing obesity status (45 to 49 years of age P less than 0.01; 50 to 54 years of age P greater than 0.05). This altered pattern of estrogen binding in perimenopausal tumors likely results from the hormonal changes of the menopausal and late premenopausal years. Recognition of their varied patterns of estrogen binding should assist in understanding the behavior of these perimenopausal tumors and in the selection of optimal antitumor therapy for their hosts.\r"

Immunohistochemical staining for neuron-specific enolase was positive diffusely in both cases. Special stainings with Grimelius' silver impregnation, and stainings for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin also were positive, although the population of positive cells was different in each case. Ultrastructural examinations confirmed the presence of numerous granules, probably neurosecretory, within the cytoplasm of many tumor cells in each case. Therefore, current cases were indistinguishable pathologically from the cystic nonfunctioning islet cell tumor. This study suggests that some PCT of the pancreas consist of endocrine cells predominantly.\r"

Blacks have the highest overall age-adjusted cancer rates in both incidence and mortality of any US population group. The overall cancer incidence rates for blacks rose 17%, while for whites it increased 13% from 1969 to 1981. The rate in black men has increased 22.9%, while the rate in black women has increased 13.1%. The overall increase is the result of increases in cancers of the lung, prostate, colon-rectum, and esophagus. The age-specific incidence of lung cancer reflects the decrease of its incidence in those between 20 and 40 years of age because of the change in smoking habits after the Surgeon General's report on smoking. The overall cancer mortality rates for blacks increased 39% during the period. Lung cancer had the highest mortality rate, having increased more than 77.8% since 1969. This trend greatly reflects the recent increase in lung cancer incidence among black women. The overall 5-year cancer survival pattern for blacks was almost unchanged from 1973 to 1981, while whites had slightly higher survival rates during this period. However, blacks had substantial increases in survival rates for cancers of the esophagus and bladder during the period.\r"

In both sexes there were steady increases in mortality rates between the middle 1950s and the middle 1970s, chiefly explainable in terms of cohort effects. This was followed by a leveling off and stabilization, starting from the younger age groups and more evident in women. The analyses of the geographic distribution of intestinal cancer mortality in the 95 Italian provinces during 1975 to 1977 showed higher rates in the north of the country and in large urban concentrations, and a bimodal distribution of mortality rates, whose minimum corresponded to a distinct north/south separation. Trend surface models fitted to intestinal cancer standardized mortality ratios showed a high determination coefficient even for the simplest models. Residuals, corresponding to outliers, were scattered in a few northern and central areas. In addition, mortality rates for cancers of the intestine in middle age people were considered according to geographic area of birth and residence at death. In both sexes rates of migrant populations were influenced both by area of birth and residence, and, in particular, there was a wide-spread unfavorable effect of residence on migrants from the South to the North (the major migrant flux in Italy). The temporal and geographic variations in intestinal cancer rates observed in this study indicate that Italy may well be a particularly interesting situation for etiologic investigations of colorectal cancers.\r"

A comparison of different populations around the world showed that Hawaii has some of the highest reported incidence rates for thyroid cancer. In addition, a comparison of ethnic-specific incidence rates for groups living in Hawaii with people of the same ethnic backgrounds living in other geographic areas showed that Hawaii residents generally have much higher rates, suggesting that environmental influences are responsible for the unusually high rates in Hawaii.\r"

Earlier, we have demonstrated that such cultures are made up mostly of typical and modified smooth muscle cells. Within 24 hours of cultivation with a 40% sera of patients suffering from coronary atherosclerosis, the total intracellular cholesterol level increased twofold to fivefold. Cultivation with the sera of healthy subjects had no effect on the intracellular cholesterol level. The sera of patients were separated by ultracentrifugation into two fractions: total lipoprotein fraction containing the main classes of lipoproteins and a lipoprotein-deficient fraction. The former, but not the lipoprotein-deficient fraction, was characterized by atherogenicity (i.e., the ability to induce the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol). Lipoproteins of the patients' serum were separated into main classes: low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and high density lipoproteins (HDL2 and HDL3). An atherogenic component of the serum capable of stimulating the deposition of intracellular cholesterol was represented by LDL and, in one case, by VLDL, but not by other classes of lipoproteins. LDL and other lipoproteins isolated from the blood serum of healthy subjects failed to raise the cholesterol content in cultured cells; that is, they were nonatherogenic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The animals were instrumented with a left ventricular pressure transducer, and regional systolic wall thickening (%WTh) was assessed by sonomicrometry in the anterior and posterior walls of the left ventricle. An intracoronary catheter was implanted chronically in the circumflex coronary artery, and a hydraulic cuff was placed proximally around the artery. After beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (0.8 mg/kg i.v.), acute stenosis of the coronary artery was performed during running in five dogs to induce severe regional myocardial dysfunction in the posterior wall. Intracoronary infusion of the selective alpha 2-adrenergic blocking agent idazoxan (80 micrograms/kg) improved %WTh in the ischemic region from 5.1 +/- 1.6 to 10.8 +/- 2.8% (p less than 0.05), without any significant effect on the anterior wall. Blood flow to the subendocardium of the posterior wall (radioactive microspheres) increased from 0.17 +/- 0.05 to 0.45 +/- 0.30 (ml/min)/g (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that in exercising dogs subjected to beta-adrenergic blockade, significant postjunctional alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated coronary vasoconstriction exists, even during severe ischemia. Regional alpha 2-adrenergic receptor blockade can reduce regional ischemia and improve contractile function by attenuating exercise-induced sympathetic vasoconstriction in this conscious animal model.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of action of adrenaline on cardiac contractility in rat papillary muscles containing V1 and V3 isomyosins was analyzed during barium-activated contractures at 25 degrees C by frequency domain analysis using pseudo-random binary noise-modulated perturbations. The analysis characterizes a frequency (fmin) at which dynamic stiffness of a muscle is a minimum, a parameter that reflects the rate of cycling of crossbridges. We have previously shown that fmin for V1- and V3-containing papillary muscles were 2.1 +/- 0.2 Hz (mean +/- SD) (n = 10) and 1.1 +/- 0.2 Hz (n = 8), respectively, and that these values were independent of the level of activation. The present study's goal was to determine whether the inotropic action of adrenaline was associated with an increased rate of crossbridge cycling. The results show that a saturating dose of adrenaline increased fmin in V1 hearts by 49 +/- 2% (n = 11). The action on V3 hearts was significantly less; the increase in fmin was 26 +/- 2% (n = 6). The increase in fmin for V1 hearts was shown to be sensitive to the beta-blocking agent propranolol. These results suggest that adrenaline significantly increases the rate of crossbridge cycling by a beta-receptor-mediated mechanism. We conclude that the increased contractility of the heart in the presence of adrenaline arises not only from more complete activation of the contractile proteins but also from the increased rate at which each crossbridge can transduce energy.\r"

  ".W": "Exchange of intracellular sodium for extracellular lithium readily occurs in vascular smooth muscle, but the mechanism of this exchange is not known. These studies examined whether a sodium-lithium countertransport system was present in the cell membrane of vascular smooth muscle. A sarcolemmal-enriched vesicle preparation was obtained from canine superior mesenteric artery via a magnesium aggregation and differential centrifugation technique. An outwardly directed gradient for lithium stimulated 22Na uptake by the vesicles, and an inwardly directed gradient for lithium stimulated 22Na efflux. These effects were not due to an alteration in membrane potential, and sodium uptake was not stimulated by lithium in the absence of a gradient for lithium. The lithium gradient-stimulated component of sodium uptake was not affected by a change in membrane potential and was insensitive to ouabain. Both sodium-lithium exchange and sodium-proton exchange in sarcolemmal-enriched vesicles were inhibited by two compounds that inhibit the sodium-lithium countertransport system in red cells, phloretin and quinidine. Ethylisopropylamiloride also inhibited both sodium-lithium exchange and sodium-proton exchange in the vesicles. In support of the possibility that sarcolemmal sodium-lithium exchange and sodium-proton exchange are mediated by a single cation exchange mechanism with affinity for sodium, lithium, and protons, we found that an inwardly directed sodium or lithium gradient stimulated proton efflux, and that the stimulation of sodium efflux by external lithium or protons was not additive. It is concluded from these studies that sarcolemmal vesicles from canine superior mesenteric artery contain an electroneutral, phloretin, quinidine, and ethylisopropylamiloride inhibitable sodium-lithium exchange transport system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

While Na+-Ca2+ exchange has been proposed to contribute to transmembrane Ca2+ flux, its role in cultured VSMC is unknown. Accordingly, we have investigated the role of Na+-Ca2+ exchange in unidirectional and net transmembrane Ca2+ fluxes in cultured rat aortic VSMC under basal conditions and following agonist-mediated stimulation. Transmembrane Ca2+ uptake was significantly increased in response to a low external Na+ concentration ([Na+]o) compared with 140 mM [Na+]o. Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in response to low [Na+]o was further increased by intracellular Na+ loading by preincubation of the VSMC with 1 mM ouabain. Under steady-state conditions, Ca2+ content varied inversely with [Na+]o, increasing from 1.0 nmol Ca2+/mg protein at 140 mM [Na+]o to 4.0 nmol Ca2+/mg protein at 20 mM [Na+]o. Increasing [K+]o to 55 mM also enhanced Na+-dependent Ca2+ influx. Augmentation of Ca2+ uptake with K+ depolarization was not significantly inhibited by the calcium channel antagonist verapamil. Transmembrane Ca2+ efflux was increased in response to 130 mM [Na+]o compared with zero [Na+]o (iso-osmotic substitution with choline+), and was further stimulated by the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, which is known to elevate [Ca2+]i. These changes in [Ca2+]i were studied directly using fura-2 fluorescence measurements. Elevated [Ca2+]i levels returned to baseline more rapidly in the presence of normal (130 mM) [Na+]o compared with zero [Na+]o (iso-osmotic substitution with choline+). These findings suggest that a bidirectional Na+-Ca2+ exchange mechanism is present in cultured rat aortic VSMC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, such as nifedipine, inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro and ex vivo, but the mechanism by which this occurs is uncertain. Bay K 8644 (BAY) is a substituted dihydropyridine that has effects on voltage-dependent calcium channels in cardiac and smooth muscle that are opposite the effects of nifedipine. To evaluate the mechanism responsible for dihydropyridine-induced inhibition of platelet function, we studied the in vitro effects of BAY on human platelet aggregation and secretion plus several related biochemical parameters, including cytoplasmic ionized calcium ([Ca2+]i). BAY exerted concentration-dependent effects on platelet aggregation and secretion of [14C]serotonin. BAY (1-10 microns) inhibited the second wave of platelet aggregation and secretion stimulated by adenosine diphosphate or epinephrine and blocked shape change, aggregation, and secretion induced by the thromboxane A2 (TXA2) mimic, U46619. BAY also inhibited U46619-induced phosphorylation of the approximately 40,000-dalton cytoplasmic protein substrate of protein kinase C (40K protein), formation of TXA2, and rise in [Ca2+]i, all biochemical consequences of platelet activation. The (+)-(R) enantiomer of BAY [BAY(+)] was predominantly responsible for the inhibitory effects of racemic BAY. Nifedipine had the same inhibitory effects on platelet function and biochemistry, except it was approximately 10 times less potent than BAY. Since these results suggested inhibition of the TXA2-prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) receptor, we measured binding of [3H]U46619 to intact platelets. BAY, BAY(+), and nifedipine all functioned as competitive antagonists of [3H]U46619 binding (BAY Ki = 1.47 microM). They did not inhibit binding of [3H]yohimbine to platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. At 1-10 nM BAY, BAY(+) and the (-)-(S) enantiomer of BAY [BAY(-)] all resulted in slight stimulation of platelet function and biochemical events. No significant increase in [3H]U46619 binding was demonstrable, however. Therefore, dihydropyridines that function as either calcium channel agonists or antagonists in cardiac or smooth muscle exert concentration-dependent effects on platelet function. In nanomolar concentrations, they augment, and in micromolar concentrations, they inhibit platelet activation induced by TXA2 or U46619. These data indicate that dihydropyridines do not inhibit TXA2-induced platelet activation by an effect on voltage-dependent calcium channels; they define the mechanism of inhibition as competitive antagonism of the TXA2-PGH2 receptor. The mechanism responsible for augmentation of platelet activation is uncertain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We studied three groups of monkeys: normal, atherosclerotic, and regression. Blood flow to vasa vasorum was measured with microspheres. Blood flow to intima-media (ml/min x 100 g) was 5 +/- 1 (mean +/- SEM) in normal and 47 +/- 7 in atherosclerotic monkeys (p less than 0.05). Infusion of phenylephrine or serotonin did not alter flow through vasa in normal monkeys. In atherosclerotic monkeys, phenylephrine decreased flow through vasa vasorum in intima-media of coronary arteries to 24 +/- 4 (p less than 0.05), and serotonin decreased flow to 27 +/- 5 (p less than 0.05). In regression monkeys, blood flow to intima-media was sixfold less (7 +/- 2 ml/min x 100 g) than in atherosclerotic monkeys (p less than 0.05). During infusion of adenosine, blood flow to vasa was fourfold greater in atherosclerotic monkeys than after regression of atherosclerosis. This finding suggests that loss of vessels, not constriction of existing vessels, accounts for the decrease in flow through vasa in intima-media after regression of atherosclerosis. We conclude that vasa vasorum in atherosclerotic coronary arteries respond to vasoconstrictor stimuli and that there is loss of vasa vasorum and a large decrease in blood flow through vasa to intima-media of coronary arteries after regression of atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of angiotensin II on cultured neonatal rat heart myocytes was studied by measuring changes in cell length, the magnitude and kinetics of the calcium current, and changes in cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and phosphoinositide metabolism. Spontaneous beating frequency of multicellular networks was increased by angiotensin II with a maximal increase of 100% above control values at concentrations of 5 nM or greater. The half-maximal response occurred at 0.6 nM angiotensin II. Shortening amplitude, shortening velocity, and relaxation velocity decreased concomitantly with the increasing contractile rate. In voltage-clamped single myocytes, both steady-state and transient components of the calcium current were increased by the addition of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II had no effect on either control or isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in myocyte membranes. Neither the basal levels nor the isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in intact cells was affected by addition of hormone. In myocytes labeled with [3H]inositol, angiotensin II stimulated the formation of [3H]inositol phosphates. One minute after addition of 5 nM angiotensin II, inositol monophosphate and inositol bisphosphate levels were increased to 73% and 99%, respectively, above control values and remained elevated at 10 minutes. Inositol trisphosphate levels were not significantly different from control values at either time point. Nifedipine (10 microM) had no effect on angiotensin II-induced increases in [3H]inositol phosphates. We conclude that the increases in both spontaneous beating rate and calcium current in angiotensin II-stimulated cultured neonatal heart cells are not dependent on cAMP or inositol trisphosphate levels but may involve sustained phosphoinositide hydrolysis.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these studies was to characterize the rates of fatty acid oxidation in reperfused myocardium and test the influence of excess fatty acids (FA) on mechanical function in the extracorporeally perfused, working swine heart model. Seventeen animals were prepared. Eight were untreated (LOW FA group; serum FA averaged 0.55 +/- 0.07 mumol/ml) and nine received a constant infusion of 10% Intralipid with heparin to raise serum FA to about 1.4 +/- 0.21 mumol/ml (HIGH FA group). Coronary flow in both groups was held at aerobic levels for an equilibrium period of 40 minutes, acutely reduced regionally in the anterior descending circulation by 60% for 45 minutes, and acutely restored to aerobic levels for 60-minute reflow. Appreciable mechanical depression (-47 delta% from aerobic values; p less than 0.01) during reperfusion was noted in both groups. This was associated with modest reductions in myocardial oxygen consumption (p less than 0.05) and losses of total tissue carnitine stores (p at least less than 0.02). Reperfused myocardium showed a strong preference for and aerobic use of FA during reflow such that 14CO2 production from labeled palmitate exceeded preischemic levels (+89 delta% in LOW FA hearts; +111 delta% in HIGH FA hearts). This suggested relative preservation of restoration of certain elements in mitochondrial function during reflow. The findings argue for uncoupling between substrate metabolism and energy production, accelerated but useless energy drainage, or some impairment between energy transfer and function of contractile proteins as possible explanations for the persistent depression of mechanical function (stunning) during reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The manner in which the left atrium adapts to chronic mitral regurgitation and the role of the adapted left atrium as a modulator of excessive central blood volume were analyzed in seven conscious dogs, instrumented with high-fidelity pressure transducers and ultrasonic dimension gauges for measurement of left atrial and left ventricular pressure and cavity size. After obtaining data in a control situation, mitral regurgitation was produced by transventricular chordal sectioning. Heart rate was matched by right atrial pacing. In the \"early\" stage (7-14 days), left ventricular end-diastolic and mean left atrial pressures increased from 6 to 16 mm Hg and from 4 to 12 mm Hg, respectively. Both left ventricular end-diastolic segment length and left atrial diameter prior to atrial contraction increased by 7%. In the \"late\" stage (20-35 days), despite significant decreases in left ventricular filling pressure (11 mm Hg) and left atrial pressure (8 mm Hg), there was a continuous increase in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (10%) and atrial end-diastolic diameter (10%). After the onset of mitral regurgitation, the left atrium performed greater work with a more enlarged cavity. Left atrial chamber stiffness was progressively decreased. These changes were associated with progressive increase in the left atrial diameter at zero stress, and there was a significant increase in the diameter of the left atrial myocyte. These results indicate that during chronic mitral regurgitation, the left atrium enlarges in size and mass, with a more potent booster action. The left atrial chamber becomes more compliant. Thus, the enlarged left atrium appears to exert an important compensatory mechanism in the case of excessive central blood volume by buffering pressure rise in the atrium and by providing an adequate ventricular filling volume.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of left ventricular dilatation on epicardial pacing threshold, conduction velocity, and effective refractory period (ERP) in the isolated, retrograde perfused rabbit heart. Left ventricular size was modified by acutely changing the volume of a fluid-filled balloon anchored within the vented left ventricle. Increases in left ventricular volume, associated with increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 0 +/- 1 to 35 +/- 2 mm Hg, were not associated with significant changes in pacing threshold or conduction velocity. The left ventricular ERP decreased significantly with an added volume of 1.5 ml (91.4 +/- 5.5 msec) compared with starting volume (117.7 +/- 3.8 msec, p less than 0.01). Right ventricular ERP did not change significantly with increases in left ventricular volume. The left and right ventricular ERPs were comparable at starting volume (117.7 +/- 3.8 and 117.6 +/- 3.5 msec, respectively; p = NS) but were significantly different with an added volume of 1.5 ml (91.4 +/- 5.5 and 112 +/- 5.6 msec, p less than 0.05). These changes were independent of coronary perfusion pressure and paced cycle length, suggesting that ischemia is an unlikely explanation for the observed effects. Changes in left ventricular volume decreased left ventricular ERP in a regionally heterogeneous manner, increasing the temporal dispersion of recovery over the left ventricle nearly twofold. Induced ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation) were significantly more frequent at high (35%) than at low (3%) volumes during left ventricular pacing. We conclude that ventricular dilatation is associated with increased dispersion of refractoriness in this model, a finding that correlates with propensity for reentrant arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are one mechanism proposed to cause certain cardiac arrhythmias. We studied the effect of the Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K 8644 (1 x 10(-8) to 5 x 10(-5) M) on normally polarized sheep and canine cardiac Purkinje fiber short segments. EADs occurred with higher Bay K 8644 concentrations and had an average take-off potential of -34 mV. The initiation of EADs was preceded by lengthening of action potential duration and flattening of the plateau. Induction of EADs with Bay K 8644 was enhanced by low stimulation frequencies, lowering of [K]o, addition of tetraethylammonium chloride, or application of depolarizing constant current pulses during the plateau. EADs were abolished by increasing stimulation frequency, raising [K]o, the addition of tetrodotoxin, lidocaine, ethmozin, verapamil, and nitrendipine, or application of repolarizing constant current pulses. Using current pulses to modify the action potential plateau, a steep inverse relationship was found between the EAD peak voltage and its take-off potential, and EADs could be initiated over only a narrow range of take-off potentials. Thus, interventions that suppressed EADs shortened action potential duration or shifted the plateau away from the voltage range needed to initiate EADs. These observations suggest that mechanisms dependent on both time and voltage underlie EADs, and provide a unifying hypothesis for the induction of the EADs. We propose that induction of EADs requires 1) lengthening of action potential duration within a plateau voltage range where 2) recovery from inactivation and reactivation of an inward current possibly carried through Ca2+ channels can occur.\r"

Resting membrane potential was -60.3 +/- 4.3 mV (n = 66). Transient depolarizations (TDs) graded in amplitude with stimulus intensity were elicited with single stimuli. An action potential of 47 +/- 5 mV was superimposed upon the TD above a threshold membrane potential of -48 +/- 4 mV. Following the spike, a period of slow repolarization requiring 77 +/- 33 seconds was observed. Repetitive stimulation led to summation of TDs and a slow depolarization (less than or equal to 21 mV) that persisted for up to 90 seconds. The TD was reduced in amplitude when the membrane was depolarized with increased [K]o and enhanced when the membrane was hyperpolarized by adding potassium back to a potassium-depleted tissue. Phentolamine (10(-5) M), prazosin (10(-6) M), guanethidine (2 X 10(-5) M), alpha,beta-methylene ATP (2 X 10(-5) M), tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M), and 10-20 mM norepinephrine did not block TDs, action potentials, or slow depolarization. TDs were abolished following cold storage (4 degrees C) for 4 days and significantly reduced in a 2.25-mM CdCl2 solution with 0.25 mM CaCl2. Acetylcholine (10(-8) M to 10(-5) M) produced membrane hyperpolarization and reduced the amplitude of TDs and altered their time course. Atropine (10(-5) M) blocked the effects of acetylcholine but had no effect on the response to nerve stimulation. These observations indicate that TDs exhibit some, but not all, of the properties characteristic of excitatory junction potentials obtained with release of neurotransmitter substances in other vessels. If these TDs are neural events, they must involve a transmitter other than norepinephrine, acetylcholine, or ATP.\r"

These sequences were compared with the activation sequences of six episodes of nonsustained atrial tachyarrhythmias induced in three control hearts. Total endocardial activation of both atria during normal sinus rhythm and during the arrhythmias was determined first by recording simultaneously from 192 pairs of recording electrodes positioned into egg-shaped electrode arrays, and then by determining the moment of activation from each of the recorded electrograms. Isochronal maps of total activation were constructed by computer. Nonsustained atrial rhythms inducible in control hearts were due to circus movement excitation either in the left atrium (two episodes) or in the right atrium (four episodes). On the other hand, all 15 episodes of sustained atrial flutter induced and mapped in the TI/PS dog hearts were due to reentrant excitation in the enlarged right atrium. The reentrant pattern could be in a clockwise or counterclockwise pattern. In these episodes of stable flutter an area of functional block was an essential component to the reentrant excitation.\r"

  ".W": "The pathophysiology of the ventricular fibrillation that complicates digitalis intoxication was investigated. In this and other calcium-overload states, oscillations of the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) have been implicated as the cause of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. We addressed two questions: 1) Are [Ca2+]i oscillations obligatory in the pathogenesis of ventricular fibrillation during digitalis toxicity? 2) What are the metabolic consequences of [Ca2+]i oscillations? Ferret hearts (n = 20) were Langendorff-perfused at constant flow with oxygenated HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution at 37 degrees C. Isovolumic left ventricular pressure was measured along with the extracellular electrogram or with simultaneous phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. When strophanthidin (20 microM) was added during pacing at 3 Hz, the positive inotropic effect soon gave way to a decrease in developed force. The decrease in force was accompanied by an increase in inorganic phosphate concentration, a decrease in phosphocreatine concentration, and a slight acidosis. The rhythm changed to ventricular fibrillation after 12-25 minutes. This change was initially accompanied by further metabolic deterioration, but all metabolites reached steady state within 12-18 minutes of the onset of ventricular fibrillation. Fast Fourier transformation revealed the existence of periodic oscillations at 7-10 Hz in both the extracellular electrogram and the ventricular pressure during ventricular fibrillation. Ryanodine, an inhibitor of [Ca2+]i oscillations, abolished the pressure oscillations but not the voltage oscillations. Exposure to ryanodine significantly decreased the inorganic phosphate concentration and increased the phosphocreatine concentration (p less than 0.05) despite continuing exposure to strophanthidin. The results indicate that oscillations of [Ca2+]i are not required to sustain ventricular fibrillation, but when present, such oscillations contribute importantly to metabolic deterioration.\r"

In this study, we examined whether the left ventricular response to the afterload imposed by negative intrathoracic pressure was similar to that imposed by partial aortic constriction. We used steady-state right heart bypass to control pulmonary venous return to the left ventricle and reflex blockade to maintain constant heart rate and contractility. To impose negative intrathoracic pressure we used a pressure chamber fitted over a midsternal thoracotomy, which allowed steady negative pressure to be applied to all intrathoracic surfaces. Left ventricular volumes were measured from biplane cineradiograms of multiple 1-mm markers implanted in the left ventricular midwall. With cardiac output and heart rate constant, we compared the left ventricular response to two different levels of negative intrathoracic pressure and to increasing aortic pressure by partial aortic constriction. In each case, negative intrathoracic pressure produced a rise in the left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes as well as transmural pressures similar to the effects of partial aortic occlusion. Thus, when cardiac output, heart rate, and contractility are maintained constant and all external restraints on the left ventricle are removed, the left ventricle responds in a similar manner to an increase in hydraulic load whether produced by a decrease in intrathoracic pressure or by partial aortic occlusion.\r"

We further investigated the relation between atrial and ventricular myosin isoenzymes of human, pig, and rat, and the maximum (unloaded) shortening velocity (Vmax) and the Ca2+ sensitivity of chemically skinned fibers of the same species. The myosin isoenzymes of both human and pig atrium comigrated in the PP-PAGE with rat V2 isomyosin, whereas the ventricle of human and pig comigrated with rat V3. In both human and pig ventricle, a myosin P light chain polymorphism exists (two phosphorylatable P light chains with the same molecular weight but different isoelectric points). In contrast, we found no P light chain polymorphism in the atrium of human and pig and in the ventricle of rat (one phosphorylatable P light chain only). A correlation exists between Vmax, Ca2+ sensitivity, and atrium- and ventricle-specific myosin isoenzymes of human and pig. Vmax was determined by the slack-test method. Plots of delta l versus delta t of atrial and ventricular skinned fibers were well fitted by a single straight line up to delta l = 15% and delta l = 13%, respectively. Vmax of skinned ventricular fibers was lower than Vmax of skinned atrial fibers in both human and pig. Ca2+ sensitivity of skinned fibers of ventricle, however, was higher than Ca2+ sensitivity of atrial skinned fibers in both human and pig.\r"

In all patients with WPW who were on no medication and in those on class I and II agents, PQRST maps were normal. Two patients taking amiodarone had abnormal PQRST maps, as did patients early after surgery. In the patient with intermittent preexcitation, PQRST maps were very similar during normal and preexcited beats. In conclusion, our results support the theory that the PQRST time integral reflects intrinsic recovery properties of the heart and is independent of the activation sequence.\r"

Thus, contractile function as assessed by stress-strain and EFc-afterload relationships is frequently normal in individuals with MR when EF is normal. When EF is depressed, contractile function as assessed by EFc-afterload relationships is frequently depressed, but this does not preclude a satisfactory surgical result.\r"

  ".W": "Intracoronary thrombus is regarded as a potentially important factor in the etiology of unstable angina, but the incidence of intracoronary thrombus in unstable angina has not been clearly defined. To determine the occurrence of intracoronary thrombus during ongoing angina pectoris, coronary angiography was performed during spontaneous ischemic attacks in 37 patients with prolonged rest angina. All patients exhibited significant (greater than 50%) stenoses of at least one major coronary artery. Of the 37 patients, 21 (57%) had intracoronary thrombus in major coronary arteries, whereas 14 (38%) had fixed narrowings without evidence of intracoronary thrombus and two exhibited coronary spasm. ST segment elevation was observed in 16 of 21 patients with thrombus and in all of the patients with coronary spasm, but all the patients with organic stable obstruction showed ST segment depression. Twenty of the 21 patients with thrombus improved after thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary injection of urokinase; obstructed arteries were reopened, or narrowings were attenuated, with relief of ischemic symptoms. In patients with fixed obstructions, the rate-pressure product during active symptoms was significantly higher than during an asymptomatic period, indicating that a transient increase in myocardial oxygen demand may contribute to the ischemic attack in these patients. A high incidence (71%) of recurrent symptoms was observed in patients with intracoronary thrombus even after successful thrombolysis, in contrast to a much lower incidence (36%) in those without intracoronary thrombus. Myocardial infarction within 4 weeks after catheterization was observed more frequently in patients with intracoronary thrombus (24%) than in those without thrombus (7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-three patients with variant angina were studied during coronary angiographic examination with selective intracoronary injection of acetylcholine (ACh). In all but three patients, the location of ischemia during attack was determined by the electrocardiographic findings, by exercise 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy, and by two-dimensional echocardiography during a hyperventilation test, and the coronary artery (or arteries) responsible for the attack was predicted before the study. ACh induced spasm of at least one coronary artery in all but one patient. ACh induced spasm of both the left and right coronary arteries (i.e., multivessel coronary spasm) in 24 patients: in two of the four patients who were predicted to have spasm of the left coronary artery, in six of the 11 predicted to have spasm of the right coronary artery, in 13 of the 15 predicted to have spasm of both the left and right coronary arteries, and in three of the three in whom coronary artery responsible for attack had not been predicted. This ACh-induced spasm of the left and right coronary arteries occurred separately and no patients showed hemodynamic instability during attack. In one patient in whom multivessel coronary spasm had been predicted and ACh failed to induice coronary spasm, ergonovine maleate (0.2 mg) induced spasm of both the left and right coronary arteries simultaneously, resulting in severe prolonged hypotension. Nineteen of the 25 patients in whom multivessel coronary spasm was documented showed angiographically normal or nearly normal coronary arteries after administration of nitroglycerin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mitral valve orifice and ascending aortic blood velocities were recorded by Doppler echocardiography during steady states at each stage of exercise. Parasternal two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging of the ascending aorta adjacent to the aortic valve orifice and the mitral valve orifice at the tips of the valve leaflets was used to calculate changes in cross-sectional area during exercise. Heart rate increased from rest to exercise from 67 to 150 beats/min (124%) during supine exercise and from 72 to 147 beats/min (104%) during upright exercise. Stroke volume increased 20% during supine and 46% during upright exercise; the increase in stroke volume was statistically significant when rest and exercise were compared and when the magnitude of change was compared vs position (p less than .05). The increase in stroke volume measured at the ascending aorta was accomplished by an increase in the velocity-time integral (+15% supine and +48% upright, p less than .05), with little change in aortic cross-sectional area (5% supine and 0% upright, p = NS). By contrast, the increase in flow rate measured at the mitral valve was predominantly due to an increase in mean diastolic cross-sectional area (+29% supine and 34% upright, p less than .05); the velocity-time integral did not increase significantly (-10% supine and 4% upright; p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixty-four ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure and 38 age-matched normal control subjects performed exercise according to identical staged, symptom-limited bicycle exercise protocols with measurement of hemodynamic, ventilatory, and metabolic responses. Compared with normal subjects, ventilation and the ratio of ventilation to CO2 production (Ve/VCO2), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were elevated in patients at rest and during exercise. The ratio of pulmonary dead space to tidal volume (Vd/Vt) also was elevated in the heart failure group at rest and during exercise and was closely related to Ve/VCO2 (all r greater than .72, p less than .001). Rest and exercise arterial PCO2 regulation was normal in patients. Peak exercise Ve/VCO2 did not correlate with pulmonary vascular pressures, but was inversely related to cardiac output (r = -.49, p less than .001). Thus, neurohumoral ventilatory control mechanisms are intact in patients with chronic heart failure and act to maintain normal PaCO2 levels in the face of increased pulmonary dead space. Activation of abnormal reflexes due to hemodynamic derangements during exercise are not important in determining ventilation in the presence of chronic heart failure. The demonstration of a correlation between decreased cardiac output and increased ventilation in the patient group suggests that attenuated pulmonary perfusion may play a role in causing exercise hyperpnea in the presence of chronic heart failure by producing ventilation perfusion abnormalities and thereby increasing physiologic pulmonary dead space.\r"

  ".W": "Electrophysiologic studies were performed in 16 patients 11 to 45 years old (mean 33 years) with idiopathic sustained (lasting more than 5 min) ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating from the left ventricle. Endocardial mapping during VT showed that the earliest site of activation was at the apical inferior portion of the left ventricle in 14 patients whose QRS morphology during VT showed a right bundle branch block pattern and left-axis deviation, but at the apical anterosuperior portion of the left ventricle in two patients whose QRS morphology during VT showed a right bundle branch block and right-axis deviation. Single programmed ventricular stimulation induced VT in 13 patients, and rapid ventricular pacing induced VT in the remaining three patients. Rapid ventricular pacing terminated VT in all patients. The relationship between the coupling interval and the echo interval was inverse in all eight patients with a wide VT inducible zone. Entrainment was recognized in three of six patients. The initiation of VT by constant pacing depended on the number of pacing beats but not the duration of pacing in all four patients tested. Intravenous verapamil terminated the VT in 13 of 14 patients. Long-term oral verapamil was also effective in all five patients who required long-term oral therapy for their symptoms associated with VT. In conclusion (1) idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia has unique electrocardiographic, electrophysiologic, and electropharmacological properties, (2) the electrophysiologic characteristics suggest that the mechanism is reentry, and (3) verapamil is effective in both the short- and long-term treatment of VT.\r"

  ".U": "88136049\r", 
  ".W": "Transient entrainment was demonstrated during 59 pacing events in 18 episodes of sustained uniform ventricular tachycardia (VT) while recording electrograms from the site of origin of tachycardia (LE-SOO). During entrainment, the morphology of the initial component of the LE-SOO was identical to the morphology observed during the tachycardia in 13 VTs (group I), but in five VTs (group II), the initial component changed at a \"critical\" paced cycle length. The presence of the proposed surface electrocardiographic criteria for entrainment--fixed fusion and a first postpacing complex without fusion but occurring at the paced cycle length--were integrally dependent on the morphologic changes in the local presystolic electrogram. Fixed fusion of the surface electrocardiogram at one or more paced cycle lengths was detected during entrainment at 35 of 59 paced cycle lengths in 12 of 18 tachycardias, 10 of which were group I and two of which were group II VTs. Fixed fusion demonstrated by analysis of the LE-SOO was observed at one or more pacing cycle lengths in 17 of 18 VTs. In five tachycardias in which surface electrocardiographic fusion was not observed, fixed fusion was evident on analysis of the left ventricular LE-SOO during right ventricular pacing. The first postpacing interval, as measured at the surface electrocardiogram, was consistently equal to the paced cycle length in only one of 18 tachycardias and was greater than the VT cycle length in eight of 17 tachycardias. A pathway with a long conduction time was demonstrated during entrainment. However, in those 12 VTs in patients in whom pacing was performed at more than one cycle length and there was preservation of the LE-SOO morphology, the conduction time between the stimulus and presystolic electrogram remained constant. Thus, no evidence for \"atrioventricular nodal-like\" decremental conduction was observed over a wide range of pacing cycle lengths. We conclude that: (1) two of the previously proposed criteria for diagnosis of entrainment (fixed fusion on the surface electrocardiogram and a first postpacing interval equal to the paced cycle length) are overly restrictive criteria for definition of \"entrainment\" of VT, (2) analysis of endocardial recordings from the site of origin of tachycardia during attempted entrainment of VT is useful for documenting the presence of entrainment, and (3) such analysis provides a basis for the understanding of surface electrocardiographic phenomenon associated with entrainment.\r"

Activation time at the RVA during VT (measured from the onset of the VT QRS complex to the first rapid deflection of the RVA electrogram) was longer in VT reset with fusion compared with those without fusion (91 +/- 30 vs 33 +/- 32 msec; p less than .001). A right bundle branch block VT QRS morphology and a rightward and inferior axis were more common in VT reset with electrocardiographic (ECG) fusion. Additionally, the shortest return cycle following the extrastimulus resetting the VT was shorter in VT reset with ECG fusion compared with those without (327 +/- 66 vs 423 +/- 84 msec; p less than .001). Fusion of the endocardial electrogram recorded at the site of VT origin was noted in 11 of 15 VTs that were reset while a recording catheter was positioned at this site, including all eight VTs with evidence of surface ECG fusion and three of seven VTs without fusion. Seventeen VTs were reset from the right ventricular outflow tract as well as the RVA; eight demonstrated QRS fusion at both sites, five from the right ventricular outflow tract only, and four from neither site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In this report we describe electrophysiologic and histologic findings in hearts and endocardially resected preparations from patients with sustained ventricular tachycardias in the chronic phase of myocardial infarction. We recorded simultaneously from 64 endocardial sites during tachycardia in 72 patients that were operated on for medically intractable ventricular tachycardias. Two other patients underwent heart transplantation, and mapping was performed on the explanted isolated heart connected to a Langendorff perfusion set-up. During operation 139 tachycardias with different morphologies could be induced. Although the majority of evidence supports the concept of a reentrant mechanism for these tachycardias, we found that 105 tachycardias appeared to arise at a focal area of less than 1.4 cm2. In only three cases macroreentry around the infarction scar could be detected. Of 21 tachycardias in which the \"origin\" appeared to be focal, earliest subendocardial activation was preceded by discrete electrograms of low amplitude (presystolic activity). In three tachycardias presystolic activity was detected at several sites, permitting reconstruction of its route. Histology of the endocardial resected preparation in one of these cases revealed separate zones of viable myocardial fibers in areas in which presystolic activity was recorded. These zones were located intramurally and subendocardially, supporting the concept that reentry occurred via isolated bundles of surviving myocytes at the border of the infarct and the larger subendocardial muscle mass. Conduction velocity through the isolated tracts was on the order of 25 cm/sec. Similar reentrant pathways were found in the two isolated hearts. Extracellular and intracellular recordings were made from 20 endocardial preparations that were excised from areas in which tachycardia originated. Preparations were superfused in a tissue bath. These experiments showed that action potentials were usually close to normal, but occasionally action potentials with reduced amplitude and slow upstrokes were found. In addition, there were cells that exhibited both fast and slow upstrokes, depending on the direction of the wavefront. Histology of seven resected preparations and the isolated hearts showed subendocardially as well as intramurally located zones of viable myocardium. Fractionation of extracellular electrograms and slow conduction were found in areas where surviving muscle fibers and strands of fibrous tissue were interwoven, and in zones where muscle fibers were oriented in parallel but isolated by strands of connective tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

There is also no reference standard for CHF, although left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) gives a quantitative assessment of systolic function and is useful in predicting prognosis. To determine the relationship between LVEF and clinically diagnosed CHF, we compared resting LVEF determined by radionuclide ventriculography with diagnosis of CHF by clinical criteria in 407 patients, based on clinical data collected by a cardiology fellow. Of 153 patients with a low LVEF (less than or equal to 0.40), 30 (20%) met none of the criteria for CHF. Conversely, of 204 patients with normal LVEF (greater than or equal to 0.50), 105 (51%) met at least one of the criteria. We conclude that different criteria for CHF will have varying utility depending on the population being examined, and that a combination of clinical features and an objective measure of cardiac performance is needed to diagnose CHF.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the hemodynamic response to supine bicycle exercise in 20 patients late (10 +/- 2 years) after aortic valve replacement (for aortic stenosis in 12 patients, aortic insufficiency in six patients, and for combined stenosis and insufficiency in two patients). The pulmonary artery wedge pressure was obtained with a pulmonary artery balloon catheter, and left ventriculography was performed by digital-subtraction angiography after injection of radiographic contrast into the pulmonary artery. These patients were compared with 11 control subjects with no or minimal cardiac disease studied routinely for evaluation of chest pain in whom left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and a direct contrast ventriculogram were obtained. Compared with the control population, the study population had similar left heart filling pressures (7 +/- 3 vs 9 +/- 3 mm Hg, NS), but higher left ventricular ejection fractions (75 +/- 7% vs 67 +/- 7%, p less than .02) and higher left ventricular muscle mass indexes (106 +/- 28 vs 85 +/- 9 g/m2, p less than .01). Elevated myocardial muscle mass led to lower systolic wall stress in the study population than in the control subjects (254 +/- 65 vs 320 +/- 49 10(3).dynes/cm2, p less than .01) and might explain the higher ejection fraction observed. Fourteen patients had a normal response to exercise (with left heart filling pressures of 16 +/- 4 vs 18 +/- 2 mm Hg for control subjects, NS; and left ventricular ejection fraction of 77 +/- 8% vs 73 +/- 5% for control subjects, NS). However, while the remaining six patients had a normal exercise left ventricular ejection fraction (72 +/- 9%, NS), they had an abnormal rise in left heart filling pressure (33 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than .01). Preoperatively these patients also had higher left ventricular mid- and end-diastolic pressures at similar diastolic volumes, suggesting a decrease in chamber compliance. Thus, late after aortic valve replacement there is a subgroup of patients who, despite normal hemodynamics and normal left ventricular systolic function as assessed by the left ventricular ejection fraction at rest, have an abnormal response to exercise characterized primarily by a substantial rise in left heart filling pressures. Preoperatively this group also has a decrease in diastolic chamber compliance despite nearly normal left ventricular ejection fractions. This abnormality appears to result from a primary derangement of diastolic function that is not evident at rest.\r"

In addition, the response of the failing left ventricle to positive inotropic agents reflects the net interaction of multiple factors, including the magnitude of contractile abnormality and compensatory mechanisms. In the current study, left ventricular geometry, loading conditions, and contractile state were assessed in 13 patients with nonischemic DCM with the use of simultaneous high-fidelity pressure measurements and echocardiographic recordings. Comparisons were made with echocardiographic and calibrated carotid pulse data acquired in nine age-matched normal subjects. The patients with DCM were divided according to the left ventricular end-diastolic wall thickness-to-dimension ratio into groups with \"appropriate\" hypertrophy (i.e., less than or equal to 2 SDs from mean normal; n = 5; group 1) and \"inadequate\" hypertrophy (i.e., greater than 2 SDs from mean normal; n = 8; group 2). Age, New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular wall mass index, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and dimension were similar for the DCM groups. Baseline left ventricular afterload (defined as circumferential end-systolic wall stress, sigma es) was 168% and 203% greater than normal in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The administration of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine decreased left ventricular afterload by 12% in the normal subjects and by 10% in group 1 patients, while augmenting afterload by 5% in group 2 patients. The latter response occurred despite a 17% fall in systemic vascular resistance. Overall left ventricular performance, as assessed by the rate-corrected mean velocity of fiber shortening (Vcfc), was related to left ventricular afterload (i.e., sigma es). The resultant sigma es -Vcfc relationship, a sensitive measure of left ventricular contractility, was determined over a wide range of afterload conditions generated by methoxamine (normal subjects) or nitroprusside (DCM). Baseline left ventricular contractile state was 61% of normal for group 1 and 44% of normal for group 2. The contractile response to dobutamine infusion was 52% of normal for group 1 and only 22% of normal for group 2. Thus, positive inotropic therapy with dobutamine in patients with DCM is limited by (1) an attenuated contractile response and (2) elevated left ventricular afterload, which may be augmented further during its administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because there were significant differences in baseline risk factors between the two groups, a logistic regression model was used to make the necessary adjustments in the analysis. Adjusted estimates of the risk of death, death/myocardial infarction, or presence of angina pectoris did not differ between the two groups. Group 2 patients, however, had more coronary artery bypass surgery during follow-up, while those in group 1 had more second PTCA procedures. Results suggest that angioplasty can be safely applied to patients with multivessel disease, even when all significant stenoses are not dilated.\r"

  ".W": "Although a number of lines of evidence hint that an elevation of intracellular calcium leads to myocardial injury, the cellular consequences of transient Ca overload remain unclear. To determine the contractile, histologic, and metabolic sequelae of transient Ca overload, we measured developed pressure (DP) in isovolumetric Langendorff-perfused ferret hearts at 37 degrees C before and 20 min after three 5 min periods of perfusion with a 10 mM [Ca]o, 1 mM [Mg]o solution (high-Ca group, n = 8) without ischemia, and in control hearts (n = 5) exposed transiently to the same total divalent cation concentration without a change in [Ca]o (9 mM [Mg]o, 2mM [Ca]o). DP, measured at various [Ca]o (0.5 to 5 mM), was depressed in the high-Ca group relative to control (p less than .001). Representative hearts from the control group were histologically normal, whereas hearts from the high-Ca group exhibited rare foci of predominantly \"reversible\" injury (mitochondrial swelling, glycogen deposition, and clumping of nuclear chromatin). Maximal Ca++-activated pressure (MCAP), measured from tetani after exposure to ryanodine, was also decreased in the high-Ca group (230 +/- 4 vs 262 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than .001). Cao sensitivity, determined by normalization of the DP-[Ca]o relationship to the corresponding MCAP, was shifted to higher [Ca]o in the high-Ca group. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained in four high-Ca hearts. [ATP] declined by 30% to 40% after exposure to high [Ca]o, but inorganic phosphate, phosphocreatine, and pH remained unchanged. These results indicate that transient exposure to high [Ca]o without ischemia leaves behind distinctive contractile, metabolic, and histologic sequelae. The possible implications for the pathogenesis of postischemic contractile dysfunction are discussed.\r"

The experimental myocardial infarction was created by proximal left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. In a subgroup of 24 animals selected for relatively uniform size of myocardial infarction (14% to 22% of left ventricular mass), eight animals with mean cumulative K+ balance of -4.01 +/- 2.19 meq/kg developed spontaneous ventricular fibrillation within 4 to 17 min of coronary ligation, whereas 16 animals with a mean cumulative K+ balance of -0.11 +/- 1.82 meq/kg didn't. By univariate analysis cumulative K+ deficit (p = .001) and plasma K+ concentration (p = .039) correlated significantly with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation. Multivariate analysis of the entire population of 32 animals identified cumulative K+ deficit and size of myocardial infarction as the only independent predictors of ventricular fibrillation. Cumulative K+ deficit was also an independent predictor of ventricular fibrillation induced by programmed cardiac stimulation in the conscious state 1 day after myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of nitroprusside in limiting myocardial infarct was compared with that of pinacidil, a new antihypertensive agent with potent coronary vasodilator properties, in instrumented awake dogs subjected to 4 hr of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 20 hr of reperfusion. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive intravenous normal saline, nitroprusside, or pinacidil beginning 40 min after the onset of coronary artery occlusion and continuing throughout the occlusion and the first hour of reperfusion. Nitroprusside and pinacidil were titrated to decrease mean aortic pressure by 25 mm Hg; normal saline had no effect on mean aortic pressure. Other systemic hemodynamic variables were not significantly altered by normal saline or nitroprusside, and myocardial blood flow did not change during normal saline infusion in normal and ischemic myocardium. In contrast, nitroprusside increased the blood flow and the endocardial/epicardial flow ratio in ischemic myocardium. This increase in ischemic myocardial blood flow was accompanied by a significant reduction in infarct size (40 +/- 3% of region at risk vs 58 +/- 4% in the normal saline group; p less than .05). Pinacidil increased heart rate, cardiac output, and the peak rate of rise of left ventricular pressure. Furthermore, despite causing a threefold to fourfold increase in normal myocardial blood flow, pinacidil had no effect on either blood flow to ischemic myocardium or infarct size (57 +/- 5%). The data indicate that the marked coronary vasodilator effect of pinacidil does not cause an increase in ischemic blood flow or a reduction in infarct size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88136064\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the effect of isoproterenol on cardiac energetics and function in an animal preparation of cardiomyopathy, we studied Langendorff perfused hearts from Syrian cardiomyopathic hamsters. High-energy phosphate metabolites (phosphocreatine [PCr], ATP, inorganic phosphate [Pi]) and intracellular pH (pHi) were measured by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and correlated with left ventricular developed pressure, coronary flow, and O2 consumption before and during a 10(-6)M infusion of isoproterenol. Total intracellular calcium was also determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy with the use of potassium ethylenediamine tetra-acetate cobaltate as a marker for extracellular space. In cardiomyopathic hamsters, isoproterenol infusion increased mean developed pressure by 300% (p less than .005 compared with control; n = 5), O2 consumption eightfold (p less than .0005), and PCr by 40% (p less than .05). PCr/Pi ratio, which is analogous to phosphorylation potential, improved 100% (p = .05). In normal hamsters, isoproterenol infusion resulted in an 83% increase in developed pressure (p less than .001) and a 25% increase in O2 consumption (NS). However, mean PCr and PCr/Pi decreased by 30% and 50%, respectively (p less than .05 for both), during isoproterenol infusion. pHi decreased in normal animals (p less than .01), but tended to improve in diseased animals (NS) during isoproterenol infusion. Freeze-clamp measurements of phosphate metabolites correlated well with the nuclear magnetic resonance data. Intracellular calcium increased from 0.0102 +/- 0.002 to 0.144 +/- 0.030 mumol/ml heart water in normal hamsters during isoproterenol infusion. Cardiomyopathic hamsters had a markedly elevated baseline calcium content of 60.82 +/- 5.85 mumol/ml heart water due to the presence of dystrophic calcification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All sockets showing no demarcation were found to be fixed soundly. Seven percent of the sockets showing demarcation of the outer one-third only were loose, and when two-thirds of the sockets were demarcated, 71% were loose. Ninety-four percent of the sockets with complete demarcation and all sockets that had migrated were found to be loose at revision. There is a definite correlation between roentgenographic demarcation and socket loosening. The more extensive the demarcation, the more likely it is that the socket is loose. Radiographic demarcation of the cemented socket is a prognostic sign for eventual failure.\r"

  ".W": "The highest rate of failure and the greatest technical difficulty in total hip arthroplasty occurs with congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH). Predisposing factors are failure to secure special femoral components to fit an extremely narrow and straight medullary cavity with space for only a very thin mantle of cement. The acetabulum is usually atrophic, and bone grafts are commonly required to support a small-diameter cup. The young age of the average patient and high levels of activity contribute to cement failure. A new modular cementless prosthesis provides excellent immediate skeletal fixation and pain relief in CDH patients. Five modular components are screwed or press-fit into bone. The modular approach facilitates implantation, reduces inventory, and is adaptable to unforeseen problems. These advantages are ordinarily absent with standard or custom cemented components. Modular components may also permit easier revision. The prosthesis is made of titanium alloy for its superalloy strength, elastic modulus, and bioinertness. By omitting the cement mantle, press-fit is obtained with the largest possible implant. The large size minimizes stem breakage in these young, small bones. Excellent short-term results suggest that modular cementless implants are indicated in some patients with CDH.\r"

Dosages were 1 g of cefazolin before surgery followed by 500 mg every eight hours for six doses, versus 2 g of cefamandole before surgery followed by 1 g every eight hours for six doses. Intraoperative doses were given during prolonged procedures. No significant adverse drug reactions were clearly attributable to either drug. Among 48 patients receiving cefazolin there was one postoperative wound infection and one distant site infection. Among 49 patients receiving cefamandole, there were two postoperative wound infections and two distant site infections. No deep wound infections occurred in either group during at least 48 months of follow-up study. In hip specimens removed at surgery, the mean antibiotic concentrations were 1.6 +/- 1.4 micrograms/g for cefazolin recipients, compared with 5.7 +/- 5.9 micrograms/g for cefamandole recipients (p less than .001). In knee specimens, the mean antibiotic concentrations were 0.64 +/- 0.57 microgram/g for cefazolin recipients compared to 3.8 +/- 3.4 micrograms/g for cefamandole recipients (p = .004). Cefazolin given at one-half the dose of cefamandole appeared to be equally safe and effective but resulted in lower bone concentrations of antibiotic.\r"

Other imaging modalities employed had significant limitations. Plain films were of little value because of the intrinsically low contrast of soft tissues. Angiography was not necessary unless MRI suggested a vascular lesion or proximity to major blood vessels. Computed tomography (CT) and MRI both readily identified fatty lesions and their relationship to adjacent structures. Some soft tissue tumors could not be delineated from normal muscle with CT, but were easily seen with MRI. MRI is ideally suited for the study of suspected soft tissue tumors because of its excellent soft tissue contrast and its ability to image directly in any plane. Optimum evaluation required imaging in at least two planes with spin echo sequences chosen to bring out both T1 and T2 features.\r"

Cadaver femurs were used to test the following two hypotheses: (1) Average anatomic stems, designed using the optimal-fit software for an average femoral geometry, improve implant-bone fit when compared with standard stems; and (2) Individualized optimal-fit stems provide an even better fit than average anatomic stems. Results showed that the average anatomical stems fit better than the standard stems. However, the individualized hip stems, designed from individual three-dimensional geometry data, fit the best.\r"

  ".W": "A technique involving the use of autogeneic cancellous bone to facilitate union of the greater trochanter following hip arthroplasty via a transtrochanteric approach is presented. This technique has not been previously reported for a large series of patients. Two hundred thirty-five patients were treated with 286 hip arthroplasty procedures via a transtrochanteric approach. All trochanters were advanced 1-2 cm distally and reattached using a three-wire technique. In 111 procedures, cancellous bone taken from the excised femoral head or neck was placed at the inferior aspect of the osteotomy site. In the remaining 175 procedures, no bone grafting was performed. Retrospectively, the incidences of trochanteric nonunion at two-year follow-up evaluation for the nongrafted versus the grafted groups were as follows: 5.7% (10 of 175) versus 2.7% (3 of 111) overall incidence, 4.3% (6 of 139) versus 1.2% (1 of 85) in patients with no previous hip surgery, 8.7% (2 of 23) versus 0% (0 of 10) in patients with previous hip surgery (excluding previous hip arthroplasty), and 15.4% (2 of 13) versus 12.5% (2 of 16) in patients following revision arthroplasty. There was no significant difference in incidence of nonunion between the grafted versus nongrafted groups in any of these categories (chi-square analysis). However, a lower incidence of trochanteric nonunion was found for the patients with autografts in each category, which may indicate a beneficial effect of cancellous bone grafting following trochanteric osteotomy.\r"
