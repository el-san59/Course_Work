Although past research has considered the link between bereavement support and adjustment to a loved one's death, the influence of support to the care recipient has not been investigated. Analyses of prospective panel data from 73 spouse and adult-child caregivers show caregiving support characteristics to be more important for bereavement adjustment than support provided to the surviving caregiver after their relative's death.\r"

Three separate studies (total N = 191) demonstrate the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity (content, divergent, convergent, and criterion) of the scales. Finally, evidence suggests that changes in OB and SB over time are explained by changes in care-recipient functioning and caregiver distress.\r"

Open oral provocation with 100 or 250 mg hydrocortisone in patients with hydrocortisone contact hypersensitivity elicited cutaneous reactions at sites of previous allergic dermatitis caused by hydrocortisone in two patients and at sites of earlier allergic patch test reactions caused by hydrocortisone in the other two patients. Provocations in two patients with contact hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone-17-butyrate but not to hydrocortisone remained negative. To determine whether the adrenal cortical hormone cortisol, which is identical to hydrocortisone, could induce similar skin reactions, one patient with hydrocortisone contact hypersensitivity underwent adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation tests; as a control, one hydrocortisone-sensitive patient underwent analogous provocations with placebo. After an 8-hour infusion with the adrenocorticotropic hormone analog tetracosactide, a similar skin reaction to that seen with oral hydrocortisone was observed, whereas provocations with placebo remained negative. We conclude that both oral hydrocortisone and intrinsic cortisol are able to induce allergic skin reactions in presensitized subjects.\r"

This usually occurred in infancy and was difficult to control; recurrences developed several times per year. Three had the subacute benign annular pattern. They tended to be older and often had resolution within several years. Three had a mixed pattern with Zumbusch flares preceded by an annular or acral pattern. Most patients had an eruption preceding the generalized pustular psoriasis and often had precipitating factors. Generally, generalized pustular psoriasis has little serious chronic morbidity.

Using Gould's clinicopathologic classification, we have found four trabecular types, eleven intermediate cell types, and two small cell types. One tumor could not be classified. Other noteworthy pathologic features were association with invasive squamous cell carcinoma, lentiginous melanocytic hyperplasia, and presence of intratumoral melanocytes. Immunoreactivity for cytokeratins (56 kD), neurofilaments, neuron-specific enolase, and epithelial membrane antigen was observed. The paranuclear globular staining pattern of cytokeratins and neurofilaments was conspicuous. The ultrastructural features revealed paranuclear intermediate filament aggregates (fibrous bodies), neurosecretory granules, and cell junctions. In two metastatic tumors, high levels of catecholamines were found. The trabecular types were characterized by localized disease and a good prognosis. The patients with the small cell types died of distant metastases. Postoperative radiotherapy seemed to reduce the rate of local recurrences.\r"

In 50.4% of the patients the response was either excellent (total regrowth) or satisfactory (subtotal regrowth with only a few remaining bald patches). The most frequent side effects were eczematous reactions with blistering, spreading of the induced contact eczema, and sleep disturbances.\r"

At the end of this time the median number of papules in the metronidazole-treated group was reduced to 8% of the initial number, and the median number in the group treated with tetracycline was reduced to 0% of the initial number. Although both treatments were effective, oral tetracycline was significantly more effective than topical metronidazole.\r"

Of 1219 persons asked to fill out a questionnaire, 1116 (92%) completed it. Our study demonstrates that persons attending the melanoma/skin cancer screening program were, for the most part, at risk for the disease and appropriately selected themselves to be screened. Most were women, well educated (with college or advanced degrees), and white. More than 86% had at least one risk factor for melanoma/skin cancer whereas 78% had at least two risk factors. Future studies are necessary to determine whether our experience can be verified. Additional efforts should try to attract those who are at risk but perhaps are less willing to attend screening programs--men and those of lower socioeconomic status. These efforts can help target screening to those at highest risk and maximize the yield of these public health efforts.\r"

  ".W": "Sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmic drugs have preferential effects on diseased, slowly conducting myocardium, and slowing of tachycardia caused by these drugs may result primarily from further prolongation of conduction time in slowly conducting tissue. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia, late potentials detected by signal-averaged electrocardiography (ECG) are thought to arise from slowly conducting ventricular myocardium. This study tested the hypothesis that sodium channel blocking drugs selectively prolong the late potential, or terminal low amplitude signal, portion of the signal-averaged QRS complex and that prolongation of the late potential would correlate with slowing of ventricular tachycardia. Fifty-six drug trials in 32 patients with spontaneous and inducible ventricular arrhythmias were studied. Prolongation of the late potential (11 +/- 15 ms) was significantly greater than prolongation of the initial portion of the QRS complex (4 +/- 9 ms) (p = 0.01). Selective prolongation of the late potential by drugs resulted in significantly greater QRS prolongation detectable by signal-averaged ECG than by standard ECG (p less than 0.0001). In 40 trials in which ventricular tachycardia remained inducible during drug therapy, the increase in induced tachycardia cycle length correlated strongly with the increase in late potential duration (p = 0.005) but not with change in the initial portion of the QRS complex. These data suggest that in patients with ventricular tachycardia, sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmic drugs have preferential effects on slowly conducting tissue and that drug effect on slowly conducting tissue contributes to prolongation of ventricular tachycardia cycle length.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical decisions utilizing either Doppler echocardiographic or cardiac catheterization data were compared in adult patients with isolated or combined aortic and mitral valve disease. A clinical decision to operate, not operate or remain uncertain was made by experienced cardiologists given either Doppler echocardiographic or cardiac catheterization data. A prospective evaluation was performed on 189 consecutive patients (mean age 67 years) with valvular heart disease who were being considered for surgical treatment on the basis of clinical information. All patients underwent cardiac catheterization and detailed Doppler echocardiographic examination. Three sets of two cardiologist decision makers who did not know patient identity were given clinical information in combination with either Doppler echocardiographic or cardiac catheterization data. The combination of Doppler echocardiographic and clinical data was considered inadequate for clinical decision making in 21% of patients with aortic and 5% of patients with mitral valve disease. The combination of cardiac catheterization and clinical data was considered inadequate in 2% of patients with aortic and 2% of patients with mitral valve disease. Among the remaining patients, the cardiologists using echocardiographic or angiographic data were in agreement on the decision to operate or not operate in 113 (76% overall). When the data were analyzed by specific valve lesion, decisions based on Doppler echocardiography or catheterization were in agreement in 92%, 90%, 83% and 69%, respectively, of patients with aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Differences in cardiac output determination, estimation of valvular regurgitation and information concerning coronary anatomy were the main reasons for different clinical management decisions. These results suggest that for most adult patients with aortic or mitral valve disease, alone or in combination, Doppler echocardiographic data enable the clinician to make the same decision reached with catheterization data.\r"

Fifty-two consecutive patients admitted with unstable angina who responded to medical treatment and underwent stress thallium-201 imaging within 1 week of discharge were studied. Patients were followed up for 39 +/- 11 months. Cardiac events included cardiac death (n = 3), nonfatal myocardial infarction (n = 4) and admission for unstable angina or revascularization (n = 17). The ability of thallium-201 data (redistribution, fixed defects, normal) to predict cardiac events was compared with clinical data (age, gender, prior myocardial infarction, anginal syndrome, rest and stress electrocardiogram) and cardiac catheterization data using logistic regression. Thallium-201 redistribution was the only significant predictor of cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05). The number of myocardial segments with thallium-201 redistribution (p less than 0.0005) and a history of prior myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05) were the only significant predictors of all cardiac events. Cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred more frequently in patients with thallium-201 redistribution (6 [26%] of 23) than in those without redistribution (1 [3%] of 29, p less than 0.05). Similarly, total cardiac events developed more frequently in patients with thallium-201 redistribution (p less than 0.001). Stress thallium-201 imaging has important prognostic value in patients admitted with unstable angina who respond to medical therapy and can identify subgroups at high versus low risk for future cardiac events.\r"

  ".U": "91178167\r", 
  ".W": "In 222 patients, 741 venous coronary bypass grafts were studied angiographically early, at 1 year and at a late examination at greater than 6.5 years (mean 9.6) after operation; 565 of these grafts were also examined 5 years postoperatively. Grafts were graded for patency and disease considered to be atherosclerotic and for both extent and profile of lesions. Graft occlusion rates increased steadily from 8% early to 20% at 5, 41% at 10 and 45% at greater than 11.5 years after operation. All grafts were considered free of atherosclerosis early, but disease appeared in 8% at 1 year, increasing to 38% at 5 and 75% at 10 years postoperatively. Increasing involvement of vessel wall area was associated with greater protrusion of lesions into the graft lumen. Diseased grafts became more so at subsequent examinations, with occlusion occurring in many. However, absence of disease had little prognostic significance because diseased and abruptly occluded grafts were generated in those with healthy appearance at earlier examinations. For instance, 82% of very diseased grafts at the 5 year study originated from normal grafts at 1 year and 73% of occluded grafts at 1 year had appeared normal early postoperatively. Of 590 patent grafts free of disease at 1 year, 30% were occluded at the late examination, 76% of those patent were diseased, 55% of these were diffusely diseased and 35% were greater than 50% narrowed. Only 17% of the original 590 patent grafts were healthy at this time. Bypass graft atherosclerosis severely limits the long-term utility of these grafts. It is suggested that the solution may lie in some powerful drug regimen.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between acoustic properties of the myocardium and magnitude of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An on-line radio frequency analysis system was used to obtain quantitative operator-independent measurements of the integrated backscatter signal of the ventricular septum and posterior free wall in 25 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 25 normal age-matched control subjects. The integrated values of the radio frequency signal were normalized for the pericardial interface and expressed in percent. Tissue reflectivity was significantly increased in the hypertrophied ventricular septum, as well as in the nonhypertrophied posterior free wall, in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (58 +/- 15% and 37 +/- 12%, respectively) compared with values in normal subjects (33 +/- 10% and 18 +/- 5%, respectively; p less than 0.001). Furthermore, measurements of reflectivity of the septum or posterior free wall, or both, were beyond 2 SD of normal values in greater than 90% of the patients and were also abnormal in each of the five study patients who had only mild and localized left ventricular hypertrophy. No correlation was identified between myocardial tissue reflectivity and left ventricular wall thickness in the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (correlation coefficient r = 0.4; p = NS). These findings demonstrate that myocardial reflectivity is abnormal in most patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is largely independent of the magnitude of left ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, quantitative analysis of ultrasonic reflectivity can differentiate patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from normal subjects independently of clinical features and conventional echocardiographic measurements.\r"

  ".U": "91178171\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies have attempted to predict the severity of regurgitant lesions from jet size on Doppler flow maps. Jet size is a function of both regurgitant volume and fluid entrained from the receiving chamber and, for a free jet, is a function of its momentum at the orifice. However, regurgitant jets often approach or attach to cardiac walls, potentially altering their momentum and ability to expand by entrainment. Therefore, this study addressed the hypothesis that adjacent walls influence regurgitant jet size as seen on Doppler flow maps. Steady flow was driven through circular orifices (0.02 to 0.05 cm2) at physiologic velocities of 2 to 5 m/s. At a constant flow rate and orifice velocity, orifice position was varied to produce three jet geometries: free jets, jets adjacent to a horizontal chamber wall lying 1 cm below the orifice and wall jets with the orifice at the level of the wall. Doppler color flow imaging was performed at identical instrument settings for all jets. Two long-axis views of the jet were obtained: a vertical view perpendicular to the wall, resembling that most commonly used in patients to image the length of the jet, and a horizontal view parallel to the chamber wall. Velocities along the jet were also measured by Doppler mapping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previously described Doppler color flow mapping methods for estimating the severity of valvular regurgitation have focused on the distal jet. In this study, a newer Doppler color flow technique, focusing on the flow proximal to an orifice, was used. This method identifies a proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) by displaying an aliasing interface. Volume flow rate (cm3/s) can be calculated as PISA (cm2) x aliasing velocity (cm/s). For planar circular orifices, a hemi-elliptic model accurately approximated the shape of PISA. Clinically, however, orifice shapes may be noncircular. In vitro flow experiments (n = 226) using orifices of various shapes (ellipse, square, triangle, star, rectangle) were performed. Volume flow rate calculated using a hemi-elliptic model for PISA was accurate, with average percent differences from actual flow rate = +4.3% for a square, -4.2% for a triangle, -4.7% for a star, -4.5% for an ellipse and -2.8% for a rectangle. However, average percent differences for calculated volume flow rates using a hemispheric model for PISA shape ranged from -11.6% (square) to -34.8% (rectangle). In addition, to evaluate whether PISA is influenced by machine factors, in vitro studies (n = 83) were performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Complications included vessel occlusion during the procedure, 2.4%; vessel occlusion after the procedure, 1.3%; new lesion, 0.5%; nonobstructive guiding catheter-induced dissection, 0.3%; perforation, 0.8%; distal embolization, 2.1%; Q wave myocardial infarction, 0.8% and non-Q wave myocardial infarction, 4.2%. Twelve patients (3.1%) required coronary artery bypass surgery for these complications. The atherectomy success rate was greater than 80% and the combined atherectomy and angioplasty success rate was greater than 90% for complex morphologic features such as eccentric lesions, lengthy lesions, lesions with abnormal contour, angulated lesions, ostial lesions and lesions with branch involvement. In the presence of calcific deposition, atherectomy success rate was 52% for primary lesions and 83% for restenosed lesions. Among angiographically complex lesions, calcium was the predictor for failed atherectomy (p less than 0.0001). In summary, directional coronary atherectomy is safe and effective for treatment of obstructive lesions in coronary arteries in selected cases. In particular, it achieves a high success rate in lesions with complex morphologic characteristics, such as eccentricity, abnormal contour and ostial involvement.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotriene C4 is a potent constrictor of smooth muscle in vitro and may induce coronary vasoconstriction in vivo. To study leukotriene C4 release by neutrophils in patients with coronary artery disease, neutrophils were separated from blood samples taken from the coronary sinus and aorta in 20 patients with stable exertional angina and angiographically documented coronary artery narrowings (group I). Eight patients with normal coronary arteries were also studied (group II). To assess leukotriene C4 generation, neutrophils were incubated with calcium ionophore A 23187 (0.25 microM) and the supernatants obtained after centrifugation were analyzed for leukotriene C4 by radioimmunoassay. Patients in group I had a significantly lower release of leukotriene C4 from neutrophils separated from the coronary sinus blood than from those separated from aortic blood (4.33 +/- 0.69 versus 5.92 +/- 0.54 ng/ml, p less than 0.025), whereas patients in group II had a similar release of leukotriene C4 by the neutrophils separated from coronary sinus blood and from aortic blood (6.0 +/- 0.72 versus 6.4 +/- 0.66 ng/ml, p = NS). Moreover, in group I patients, a significant correlation was found (p less than 0.01) between the extent of coronary artery disease (expressed by the Leaman coronary score) and the percent reduction in leukotriene C4 released from neutrophils separated from coronary sinus blood as compared with leukotriene C4 produced by neutrophils separated from aortic blood. These data show that neutrophils from patients with coronary artery disease have a reduced ability to produce leukotriene C4 after stimulation by calcium ionophore A 23187.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The recovery of the retrograde fast pathway excitability in atrioventricular (AV) node reentry has been difficult to assess with ventricular extrastimulation because of difficulty in achieving sufficiently short intranodal coupling intervals and the potential interposition of \"lower common pathway\" nodal tissue. To circumvent these methodologic obstacles in 10 patients with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia, a fixed atrial extrastimulus (A2) coupled to a basic atrial drive (A1) at a cycle length of 500 ms was utilized to reproducibly initiate AV node reentrant echoes. A ventricular extrastimulus (V3) was then introduced after A2 at progressively shorter coupling intervals (A2V3) in an attempt to pre-excite the retrograde fast pathway after concealed anterograde penetration by A2. In six patients, retrograde fast pathway pre-excitation was achieved at critical A2V3 intervals, as evidenced by the appearance of A3 by up to 28 +/- 6 ms in advance of the expected first AV node reentrant echo. In five of the six cases, the V3A3 interval was virtually unaltered (less than or equal to 5 ms decrease) when A2 was omitted. In seven patients, at a critically short A2V3 coupling interval (195 +/- 27 ms ), V3 abruptly failed to elicit A3 and concomitantly abolished all AV node echoes; yet when A2 was omitted, an A3 response returned, with V3A3 identical to previous values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the severity of atherosclerosis at the site of plaque rupture, 184 coronary arteries from autopsies of 162 patients who died of acute myocardial infarction were studied. There were 102 men, 72 +/- 10 years old (mean +/- SD), and 60 women, 75 +/- 8 years old. All arteries were dissected from the heart, fixed, decalcified, cut at 2 to 3 mm intervals and processed routinely for histologic examination. A planimeter was used to measure artery, plaque, thrombus and luminal cross-sectional area at the site of plaque rupture with thrombosis in sections projected at x13.8 magnification. At the site of atherosclerotic plaque rupture with superimposed thrombosis, the degree of stenosis due to plaque was: 90 +/- 7% for the right (n = 67), 91 +/- 6% for the left anterior descending (n = 79) and 91 +/- 6% for the left circumflex (n = 38) coronary arteries. Plaque rupture in fatal acute myocardial infarction occurs at sites of severe narrowing (mean 91%, range 67% to 99%). Thus, plaque rupture with thrombosis is unlikely to cause the fatal acute myocardial infarction in patients with mild to moderate coronary stenosis.\r"

  ".U": "91178178\r", 
  ".W": "After undergoing initial reconstructive surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome performed between August 1985 and March 1989, 59 patients (age range 3 to 27 months, mean 13.8 +/- 4.5) underwent elective cardiac catheterization in anticipation of a modified Fontan procedure. Five important hemodynamic and anatomic features considered to be components of successful reconstructive surgery were specifically addressed. 1) Interatrial communication: Only two patients had a measured pressure difference of greater than 4 mm Hg across the atrial septum. 2) Tricuspid valve function: Angiography demonstrated significant tricuspid valve regurgitation in only five patients (moderate in two and severe in three). 3) Aortic arch: Pressure tracings from the right ventricle to the descending aorta revealed a gradient greater than 25 mm Hg in only two patients. 4) Pulmonary vasculature: Ten patients had a calculated pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 4 U.m2; 51 (86%) of the 59 patients had no evidence of distortion (stenosis or hypoplasia) of either the left or the right pulmonary artery. 5) Right ventricular function: Five patients had an end-diastolic pressure in the right ventricle greater than 12 mm Hg and two patients had qualitative assessment of decreased ventricular function. Comparison of catheterization data between survivors and nonsurvivors of the subsequent modified Fontan procedure showed that only significant tricuspid regurgitation is a possible predictor of poor outcome. After first stage reconstructive surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, most survivors have favorable anatomy and hemodynamics at follow-up cardiac catheterization for a subsequent Fontan procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Transesophageal echocardiography was used in 18 patients (aged 1.6 to 34 years, mean age 12.6) to assess the immediate (5 patients) or intermediate (13 patients) results after a Fontan-type procedure. The findings were correlated with precordial echocardiographic (all patients) and cardiac catheterization (11 patients) data. Atrial shunting was documented by transesophageal studies in three patients (precordial in one patient). In two patients it was confirmed by cardiac catheterization; the third underwent reoperation based on the transesophageal study alone. Pulmonary artery obstruction was documented in three patients (precordial in one patient) and was confirmed by subsequent cardiac catheterization in all. Evaluation of anterior Fontan connections was successful in 5 of 8 patients (precordial in 6 of 8), and posterior connections in 10 of 10 patients (precordial in 5 of 10). A Glenn shunt could be evaluated in eight of nine patients (precordial in three of nine). Thrombus formation was detected by transesophageal studies in three patients (precordial in one patient); repeat studies were used to evaluate thrombolytic therapy in two. Atrioventricular valvular regurgitation (11 of 18 patients) was better defined by transesophageal than by precordial studies (5 of 18). A coronary artery fistula was identified in two cases (precordial in none). Transesophageal pulsed Doppler interrogation of pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein flow patterns consistently allowed a detailed evaluation of the Fontan circulation. Transesophageal echocardiography is an important diagnostic and monitoring technique after the Fontan procedure. In this series, it was far superior to precordial ultrasound evaluation and of substantial additional value to cardiac catheterization.\r"

  ".W": "The morphologic spectrum of malformations of the tricuspid valve in 14 fetal and 5 neonatal heart specimens is described. Echocardiography during fetal life had revealed the valvular malformations along with dilation of the right-sided chambers of the heart and atrioventricular (AV) valve incompetence. This functional impairment reflected either Ebstein's malformation (10 cases) or dysplasia of valve leaflets having a normal junctional attachment (9 cases). The right atrium and right ventricle were markedly enlarged, and heart weight was increased to 181% (median) and 179% (median) in the groups with Ebstein's malformation and valvular dysplasia, respectively. In contrast, lung weight was in the lower range of normal, showing a decrease of 67% (median) in patients with Ebstein's malformation and of 43% (median) in those with valvular dysplasia. One ventricular septal defect and six atrial septal defects were noted in each group. Severe obstruction at the level of the pulmonary valve was seen in 40% of the group with Ebstein's malformation and in 66% of those with valvular dysplasia. The most important factor in the particularly poor prognosis in these patients is the incompetence of the tricuspid valve, leading to right atrial enlargement and subsequent pulmonary hypoplasia. No significant difference was found between the pathologic features of fetal and neonatal hearts and no features that might have prompted the valve to become regurgitant during fetal life were identified.\r"

To assess autonomic contributions to syncope, formal autonomic function testing was performed in 22 children (aged 7 to 18 years) with recurrent syncope and a normal heart. Autonomic testing consisted of eight to nine separate tests; 14 of the 22 patients had reproduction of syncope or symptoms during testing. Patients with a positive test had a lower norepinephrine level while supine (334 +/- 86 versus 547 +/- 169 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and lower norepinephrine level in the upright position (628 +/- 219 versus 891 +/- 270 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) than did patients with a negative test. The slope of heart rate response versus log isoproterenol dose was greater in patients with a positive test than in those with a negative test (1.70 +/- 0.70 versus 0.89 +/- 0.19, p less than 0.01). All five patients with a positive test who were given intravenous propranolol had elimination of syncope with repeat testing. Eight of 10 patients with a positive test were successfully treated with atenolol, including 2 patients without prior resolution of symptoms after pacemaker implantation for symptoms attributed to bradycardia. Beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity may cause recurrent syncope in young patients. Inappropriate heart rate response to standing may elicit the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, resulting in bradycardia or hypotension, or both, in some patients. Beta-adrenergic blockade is of benefit in many of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1986 and July 1990, balloon valvuloplasty was attempted in eight newborns (less than 28 days of age) with isolated critical aortic valve stenosis. Balloon valvuloplasty could not be successfully accomplished in any of the three infants presenting before 1989. Since March 1989, when improved catheter technology became available, all five neonates presenting with critical aortic stenosis were treated successfully by balloon valvuloplasty. A transumbilical approach was utilized in all four infants in whom umbilical artery access could be obtained. One newborn who was 25 days of age underwent transfemoral balloon valvuloplasty. Balloon valvuloplasty was immediately successful in all five newborns, as evidenced by a decrease in valve gradient and improvement in left ventricular function and cardiac output. Peak systolic gradient was reduced by 64% from 69 +/- 8 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg (p = 0.005). Left ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 128 +/- 9 to 95 +/- 9 mm Hg (p = 0.02) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 20 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 1 mm Hg (p = 0.02). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation was documented in two infants after valvuloplasty. The time from first catheter insertion to valve dilation averaged 57 +/- 14 min (range 26 to 94) and the median length of the hospital stay was 4 days. With the use of recently available catheters, the transumbilical technique of balloon valvuloplasty can be performed quickly, safely and effectively in the newborn with critical aortic stenosis. It does not require general anesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass or a left ventricular apical incision and it preserves the femoral arteries for future transcatheter intervention should significant aortic stenosis recur.\r"

The principles of this technique are the removal of all abscesses and infected areas likely to drain into the infected mediastinum, excision of infected tissues down to healthy noninfected tissue and replacement with an antibiotic-impregnated homograft aortic root. All patients had evidence of progressive cardiac failure and ongoing sepsis. Mean patient age (+/- SD) at the time of operation was 42 +/- 18 years. The mean number of previous aortic valve replacements per patient was 1.6 +/- 0.7; 14 patients (47%) had undergone greater than or equal to 2 previous replacements. At operation, aortic root abscesses were found in all patients; abscess extension to adjacent structures and partial valve dehiscence had occurred in 23. In-hospital death occurred in 9 (30%) of the 30 patients. The 21 hospital survivors have been followed up for a mean of 66 +/- 42 months (range 9 to 144). Overall, 17 (81%) of the 21 hospital survivors have remained free of major adverse events (recurrence of endocarditis, need for reoperation or death). The results of our study suggest that homograft aortic root replacement should be considered favorably in the treatment of patients with aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis and root abscesses.\r"

Short-term therapy (12 weeks) maintained the decrease in mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.05) by decreasing total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.01), without reflexive cardiac stimulation or expanding intravascular volume. Renal vascular resistance decreased (p less than 0.05) while renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction remained unchanged. The response pattern to mental, isometric and orthostatic stress was similarly unchanged. Left ventricular mass diminished by 11% (p less than 0.01); myocardial contractility was unaffected. Afterload was reduced (p less than 0.05), and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and stroke volume increased (p less than 0.05).

At the follow-up catheterization, 39 (41%) of the patients were in improved condition and 56 patients (59%) had recurrence of symptoms, allowing for analysis of the effect of the procedure in two symptomatic patient subsets. In the total group the aortic valve area increased initially from 0.56 +/- 0.16 to 0.87 +/- 0.27 cm2 but partial return to the baseline valve area was evident at follow-up (0.63 +/- 0.25 cm2). Similarly, the mean aortic gradient initially decreased from 72 +/- 30 to 35 +/- 16 mm Hg but then increased to 55 +/- 25 mm Hg at follow-up. Neither the initial nor the late hemodynamic results appeared affected by any definable procedural variable at the time of valvuloplasty, including the maximal diameter of balloons, number of balloons simultaneously used, mean inflation time or total number of inflations. Such technical concerns also did not seem to affect short- or long-term outcome. Similarly, no baseline hemodynamic variable clearly separated those who became increasingly symptomatic from those whose condition was improved at the 6 month interval. At recatheterization, a reduction in the aortic valve area toward baseline was observed in 24 (62%) of the 39 improved patients and in 45 (80%) of the 56 who were symptomatic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This effect is reduced by regeneration after balloon denudation. The present study was designed to examine whether those in vitro observations could be reproduced in vivo. Sixteen male Yorkshire pigs underwent balloon removal of the endothelium from either the left anterior descending (n = 9) or left circumflex (n = 7) coronary artery. An angiographic study was performed before and 4 weeks after endothelial denudation; in the latter condition the presence of a full endothelial lining was confirmed histologically. Before endothelial denudation, intracoronary injection of serotonin (10 micrograms/kg) caused only mild constriction in both arteries. However, 4 weeks after the denudation, intracoronary serotonin repeatedly caused marked hyperconstriction in the previously denuded artery compared with the control coronary artery. Intracoronary injection of aggregating platelets stimulated by collagen caused constriction in the previously denuded artery but not in the control artery. The hyperconstriction induced by serotonin and aggregating platelets was inhibited by intravenous injection of ketanserin (a 5-HT2-serotonergic blocker). These data indicate that 1) the normal endothelium blunts the coronary vasoconstriction induced by serotonin and aggregating platelets in vivo, and 2) the inhibitory effect of the endothelium is reduced after regeneration, allowing coronary hyperconstriction or vasospasm, or both.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the role of segmental dyssynchrony as a determinant of ischemic diastolic dysfunction, systolic and diastolic mechanics of ischemic and nonischemic myocardium were compared in the open chest pig heart (n = 7). Pacing tachycardia (1.8 x heart rate at rest) was imposed for 3 to 5 min in the presence of a single critical stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (demand ischemia, n = 7). After 30 min of recovery, the left anterior descending artery was totally occluded for 1.5 min in the same pigs (primary ischemia, n = 6). Both demand and primary ischemia increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and prolonged the time constant of left ventricular pressure decline. Percent systolic shortening of ischemic segments (perfused by the left anterior descending artery) decreased by 32% during demand ischemia and by 120% during primary ischemia, but that of nonischemic segments (perfused by the left circumflex artery) did not change significantly during either type of ischemia. During demand ischemia (but not during primary ischemia), left ventricular diastolic pressure increased relative to segment length so that a higher diastolic pressure was needed to stretch the ischemic segment to the same length (decreased distensibility). In nonischemic areas, diastolic pressure and segment length increased commensurately during both types of ischemia, indicating no change in diastolic distensibility. During demand ischemia, peak early diastolic lengthening rates increased in nonischemic segments but remained unchanged in ischemic segments. Diastolic segmental dyssynchrony developed during both types of ischemia, but was more pronounced during primary ischemia. Therefore, segmental dyssynchrony is unlikely to account for the rise in diastolic pressure relative to segment length seen during demand ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that induced atrial flutter evolves from a transitional rhythm, the onset of 99 episodes of induced atrial flutter (mean cycle length 135 +/- 18 ms) lasting greater than 5 min in 40 dogs with sterile pericarditis was first characterized. In 85 (86%) of the 99 episodes, atrial flutter was preceded by a brief period (mean 1.4 +/- 0.9 s, range 0.4 to 42) of atrial fibrillation. Then, in 11 open chest studies, atrial electrograms were recorded simultaneously from 95 pairs of right atrial electrodes during the onset of 18 episodes of induced atrial flutter (mean cycle length 136 +/- 16 ms). Atrial flutter was induced by a train of eight paced atrial beats, followed by one or two premature atrial beats (7 episodes) or rapid atrial pacing (11 episodes). A short period of atrial fibrillation (mean cycle length 110 +/- 7 ms) induced by atrial pacing activated the right atrium through wave fronts, which produced a localized area of slow conduction. Then unidirectional conduction block of the wave front occurred for one beat in all or a portion of the area of slow conduction. This permitted the unblocked wave front to turn around an area of functional block and return through the area of slow conduction that had developed the unidirectional conduction block, thereby initiating the reentrant circuit. The location of the unidirectional block relative to the direction of the circulating wave fronts determined whether the circus movement was clockwise or counterclockwise. The area of slow conduction and unidirectional conduction block occurred where the wave front crossed perpendicular to the orientation of the atrial muscle fibers, suggesting a role for anisotropic conduction. These areas included the high right atrial portion of the sulcus terminalis (10 episodes), the low right atrial portion of the sulcus terminalis (4 episodes) and the pectinate muscle region (4 episodes). It is concluded that the development of a localized area of slow conduction in the right atrium followed by unidirectional conduction block in this area produced during a short period of atrial fibrillation or rapid atrial pacing is necessary for atrial flutter to occur in this model.\r"

Differentiation between this tumor and squamous cell papilloma is often difficult. The central cores of fibrous tissue in verrucous carcinoma are heavily infiltrated with inflammatory cells, which accounts for the stenosis often found. The mortality in verrucous carcinoma of the esophagus is 67% even though histologically it is a low-grade malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "Abdominal ultrasound examination is so easy that it may be overused. To reduce medical costs, we investigated whether preoperative ultrasonic abdominal survey was necessary for oncologic patients with normal liver function tests. We used the ultrasound diagnosis as the final standard to test the value of liver function tests for the prediction of liver metastases. Five hundred forty-four patients with various primary malignancies were referred for preoperative ultrasonic survey of the abdomen. The results showed that for a single test, serum albumin was most sensitive (87.2%) but least specific (29.4%), and serum bilirubin was least sensitive (13.0%) but most specific (97.2%), for the prediction of liver metastases. For a combination of five tests or more, the sensitivity was 95.9% and the specificity 29.5%. In patients with normal liver function tests, liver metastases were detected by ultrasound in two of 106 (1.9%) patients. One hundred of 544 (18.4%) patients having major abnormalities that may influence clinical management were also detected during the ultrasound examination. We conclude that ultrasound is convenient, cheap, and without side effects. It can provide additional information affecting patient management, even in the presence of normal liver function tests.\r"

We evaluated esophageal motility by manometry in 50 healthy controls and in 35 symptomatic reflux patients before, within 6 months, and 1 year after Nissen fundoplication. Preoperative motility was analyzed in relation to the presence or absence of both nonobstructive dysphagia and erosive esophagitis. We found that (a) preoperative dysphagia was related more to peristaltic dysfunction than to esophagitis; (b) peristaltic wave amplitude and duration were significantly lower than control values in patients with reflux, without correlation to degree of esophagitis or lower esophageal sphincter hypotension; (c) dysphagia ceased in most patients after antireflux surgery at the same time that normal motility was restored independently of lower esophageal sphincter pressure increments. These results suggest that motility disturbances are an important cause of dysphagia in reflux disease, and that reflux is the cause of, rather than the consequence of, peristaltic dysfunction.\r"

Use of the purified cocaine derivative \"crack\" has reached epidemic proportions in large cities. In 18 months we operated on 24 patients with perforated peptic ulcers. Five of the patients were young (27-38 years) male crack users without prior history of gastric symptoms who presented with a perforated gastric ulcer related to smoking crack. Three had had symptoms for only 1-5 days before admission. All five were afebrile, had a rigid abdomen, normal leukocyte count, and free intraabdominal air upon radiography. Five other age-matched, non-crack-using patients served as case controls. Their duration of symptoms was 1-24 months, they had elevated leukocyte counts on admission, and, in contrast to the crack users, four of these patients had duodenal perforations. The clinical presentation of the crack smokers and the unusual localization of the perforations imply different pathogenetic mechanisms than are commonly seen in perforated ulcer disease. With increasing abuse of crack, greater numbers of patients with this new complication may be expected to present to emergency services in urban areas.\r"

Histological evaluation of these nodules revealed diffuse expansion of the lamina propria by macrophages that contained numerous intracellular and extracellular acid-fast organisms.

Oral CD was the presenting symptom in 43 of 72 (60%) patients and relapsed in 34 of 60 (57%). Median age at presentation was 22 (range 6-57) years, and males were affected more often (1.85:1, male:female ratio). From a total of 228 oral lesions in 79 patients, lips (57 lesions), gingiva (40 lesions), vestibular sulci (31 lesions), and buccal mucosa (25 lesions) were the sites most frequently affected. Edema (62 lesions), ulcers (57 lesions), and polypoid papulous hyperplastic mucosa (45 lesions) were the most common type of lesions. The rate of granuloma detection was high in oral (67-77%) and intestinal lesions (45-71%). A total of 66 courses of drug therapy in 51 patients were analyzed. Complete remission of oral symptoms was achieved by systemic steroids and/or azathioprine in 13 of 26 (50%) patients, whereas strictly topical treatment with steroids resulted in complete remission of oral symptoms in 7 of 12 (58%). We conclude that oral CD exhibits a characteristic morphologic appearance, as often as not preceding intestinal symptoms in adolescents and young adults. Thus, patients with orofacial granulomatosis CD should be vigorously searched for by complete gastrointestinal endoscopic investigation. Oral CD may cause disabling pain and facial distortion, and results of treatment remain unrewarding. In the absence of data from controlled therapeutic trials, systemic steroids and/or azathioprine are recommended if topical treatment has failed to control symptoms.\r"

Beclomethasone dipropionate (BD) is a topically active steroid that undergoes rapid first-pass inactivation in the liver and is practically devoid of systemic side effects. We treated 32 consecutive patients with active distal ulcerative colitis (40 attacks) with 0.5 mg BD and/or 5 mg betamethasone phosphate (BP) enemas for 28 days. Clinical, laboratory, sigmoidoscopic, and histologic data were recorded before, during, and after the trial. The clinical efficacy of both treatments was similar. Betamethasone was slightly more effective in relation to the histologic improvement and disappearance of blood from the stools. Clinical signs of steroid overdosage were noted in patients on BP but not in patients on BD. Mean fasting plasma cortisol at the end of the trial was 2.9 micrograms/dl in the BP group and 15.3 micrograms/dl in the BD group. The adrenocorticotropin test was markedly suppressed in the BP group but not in the BD group. The absence of systemic steroid side effects makes BD enemas a useful addition in the therapy of IBD. Its oral administration should also be considered.\r"

In seven patients, cyclosporine was used as a steroid-sparing agent; in 14 it was given for refractory active disease as an adjunct to conventional treatment, and then continued as maintenance treatment. Cyclosporine was given at an initial dose of 5 mg/kg reduced by 1 mg/kg at 2-month intervals until a maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg was reached. Of the seven patients in whom cyclosporine was used as a steroid-sparing agent, six had a relapse. Remission was achieved in seven of the refractory active group, but cyclosporine was withdrawn because of side effects in six of the patients in this group. Of the seven patients who had achieved remission, six subsequently had a relapse. Therefore, 12 of 14 patients (86%) in remission had a relapse despite cyclosporine maintenance. Ten of these (83%) had a relapse at a cyclosporine dose of 2 or 3 mg/kg. Cyclosporine levels at relapse (median, 74 ng/ml) were lower than the mean levels over the first 6 weeks of treatment (median, 130 ng/ml; p = 0.02). Our data do not support the use of cyclosporine to maintain remission in Crohn's disease.\r"

There were three failures in group A and 11 in group B. In the majority of patients (71% of group A, 83% of group B) the scope could be passed under optimal viewing conditions at least one segment beyond the involved area. In group A the cecum was reached in 16% of the procedures and in group B in 18%.

At week 12, the reduction in severity and frequency scores for abdominal pain was significantly greater (p less than or equal to 0.05) in the cisapride group (60 and 61%) than in the placebo group (40 and 32%), as it was for abdominal distension (p less than 0.05). Cisapride tended to be better than placebo in diminishing flatulence. In 71% versus 39% of the patients the overall rating for the response to treatment was good or excellent at week 12. Cisapride was well tolerated. These results suggest that the drug will be useful for the management of constipation-predominant IBS.\r"

I analyzed the English language literature, including single case reports of pancreatic involvement and larger series reporting detailed pathological findings of patients with HIV infection. Nonspecific pathological changes in the pancreas are frequently seen at autopsy of HIV-infected patients, but are not more common than in controls. Several types of infections (mainly cytomegalovirus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Mycobacteria) and neoplasms (lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma) can involve the pancreas because they are usually disseminated. Although the serum amylase may be elevated, the patient remains asymptomatic. Occasional instances of severe and even fatal pancreatitis have been reported with HIV infections and attendant drug toxicity. Pentamidine has a predictable incidence of hypoglycemic episodes and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine provokes pancreatitis in a minority of treated patients. Such drug toxicity seems to deserve greater clinical concern than opportunistic infections or neoplasms.\r"

All parameters, except fasting gallbladder volume, were measured after a high-fat meal. The fasting gallbladder volume, maximum percent of gallbladder emptied, time required for maximal contraction, residual volume after maximal contraction, and percent fasting volume at 2 h in controls and patients with IBS was 19.3 +/- 8.8 ml and 24.4 +/- 9.7 ml, 67.1 +/- 10.7% and 67.6 +/- 13.5%, 41 +/- 20.6 min and 49.7 +/- 25.3 min, 6.2 +/- 3.3 ml and 7.6 +/- 5.3 ml, and 38.1 +/- 12.2% and 40.7 +/- 14.5%, respectively.

Compared with controls there was no statistically significant difference in these parameters, except the maximum percent of gallbladder emptied, which was significantly less than that in controls (57.6 +/- 16.5% vs. 67.1 +/- 10.7%; p less than 0.05). Therefore, we could not find that patients with IBS have any abnormality of gallbladder function; postprandially, patients with ED have submaximal contraction of the gallbladder.\r"

Attempts to define an exact etiology of the granulomatous hepatitis frequently does not yield a precise diagnosis, so that the physician must consider empiric treatment. In this paper we retrospectively review 23 patients in whom granulomatous hepatitis was found as part of the initial assessment of fever of unknown origin, and we report on their outcomes after an overall prospective follow-up of 37 months. In 26% a precise diagnosis was established at the time of assessment: Q-fever in three, mycobacterial disease in two, and histoplasmosis in one. In the remaining 74% no etiology was established after 44 months follow-up. Forty-one percent of the idiopathic group resolved spontaneously without therapy, and 18% received short-term prednisone or indomethacin with a favourable outcome. The remaining 41% required long-term prednisone therapy for a mean of 33.1 months, but all have remained afebrile and otherwise healthy after 59.6 months follow-up. We conclude that patients with fever of unknown origin who are diagnosed as having idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis have an excellent prognosis, even the minority who require long-term corticosteroids.\r"

Biopsy sites included the colorectum in 50%, esophagus in 22%, small bowel in 17%, and stomach in 11% of the patients. We found that statistically smaller samples were collected by the disposable biopsy forceps than by the reusable (2.48 +/- 1.11 mm versus 1.99 +/- 0.55 mm, p = 0.006). The smaller biopsy size with disposable forceps was not clinically important since all but one of 47 specimens were interpreted as adequate for histologic diagnosis. The convenience, potential cost savings, and prevention of the spread of communicable agents afforded by disposable biopsy forceps make them a possible alternative to conventional forceps in some clinical settings.\r"

When the data were stratified according to ethnic groups, the highest point prevalence was found in Israeli-born Jews (220.56 per 100,000 population), more than in Asian-African-born, or European-American-born kibbutz members (139.20 and 78.73 cases per 100,000 population, respectively). There were 68 men and 78 women (ratio of 0.87). The average age of the patients in the year of this survey was 46 years; it was 35 years at the time of diagnosis. Proctitis was found in 57%, left-sided colitis in 12%, and substantial or total colitis in 31%. Relapse at pregnancy was demonstrated in seven patients, and remission in one. Family history of a first-degree relative with inflammatory bowel disease was documented in three patients (2%). Probable complications of ulcerative colitis were observed in 38 (26%), anemia in 13 (9%). One patient (0.7%) with rectal cancer, also had breast cancer. We suggest that the impressive increase in ulcerative colitis prevalence among Israeli and Asian-African-born, in comparison with European-American-born kibbutz members, points toward a role of environmental factors in the etiology of this disease.\r"

It has been proposed that the disparate functional programs revealed in vitro may correspond directly with distinct in vivo physiologic functions--fresh LC are the in vitro equivalent of intraepidermal LC and cultured LC are equivalent to LC that have migrated from skin to the draining lymph node. As an approach to studying this proposal, we have compared the effects of two immunosuppressive agents, cyclosporin A (CsA) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta), on the alloantigen-presenting capabilities of fresh LC, cultured LC, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). CsA pretreatment (1 and 10 mu/ml x 2 h) profoundly inhibited alloantigen presentation by fresh LC, cultured LC, and PBMC. By contrast, TGF beta pretreatment (1 and 10 ng/ml x 2 h) inhibited presentation by PBMC and cultured LC, but not by fresh LC. The resistance of fresh LC to the deleterious effects of TGF beta is discussed in terms of the possibility that TGF beta may inhibit antigen processing following conventional endocytosis. We suggest that fresh, but not cultured, LC escape TGF beta effects because they possess an \"alternative\" endocytic pathway, marked by the presence of Birbeck granules.\r"

It has been also reported to act, not only on helper T cells, but also on the antigen-presenting functions of mouse epidermal cells (EC) enriched in Langerhans cells (LC). We tested the effects of CsA on the human allogeneic mixed epidermal cell-lymphocyte reaction (MECLR) using whole EC and freshly isolated LC as stimulator cells. Results were as follows. 1) CsA inhibited the lymphocyte proliferative response in a dose-dependent fashion, by about 80% for a CsA concentration of 10(-7) M. To evaluate the effects of the drug on the two cell populations involved in MECLR, stimulator EC and responder PBMC were separately pulsed for 2 h with CsA, washed, and combined to form MECLR. Inhibition by CsA of the alloantigen-dependent lymphocyte proliferation appeared to be multifactorial, because CsA-pulsed EC and CsA-pulsed effector PBMC led to identical reductions of 40% each in proliferation. 2) The nature of EC sensitivity to CsA during MECLR was then analyzed after freshly separating highly purified CD1-positive LC (greater than 95%) and LC-depleted EC (mainly keratinocytes), using an immunomagnetic particle technique. When responder PBMC were cultured with CsA-pulsed LC, a highly significant reduction of lymphocyte proliferation was observed, indicating that CsA has direct effects on LC. 3) Some of the possible mechanisms by which CsA might act on LC were studied. Substantial IL-1 activity and PGE2 amounts were induced during MECLR by LC and keratinocytes, but CsA did not act via these factors. Neither did it significantly modify HLA-DR, DQ, or DP antigen expressions on EC. In conclusion, CsA directly inhibits antigen presentation by human LC. This inhibition may partly explain the beneficial effects of CsA on skin allografts and certain cutaneous immune reactions.\r"

Normal human keratinocytes were cultured under various conditions and loricrin mRNA levels were assessed at various time points. Only Ca++ concentrations above 0.1 mM Ca++ were permissive for the expression of lori-crin mRNA. Maximal mRNA levels were found at 0.35 mM Ca++ and a critical cell density appeared to be required for optimal accumulation of loricrin transcripts. Retinoic acid (RA) at 10(-7) to 10(-9) M completely blocked Ca+(+)-induced loricrin mRNA synthesis when applied simultaneously. Furthermore, addition of RA to cultures already exposed to higher Ca++ levels resulted in the complete loss of loricrin mRNA within 48-72 h. So far, no other components of the CE have been shown to be suppressed by RA. However, similar patterns of expression were reported for filaggrin, a matrix protein also expressed late in epidermal differentiation. Therefore, we compared the mRNA levels of loricrin and filaggrin and found them to change in parallel in response to the various culture conditions. These results suggest that Ca++, cell density, and RA are crucial regulators of loricrin expression in vitro and that the transcriptional control of loricrin and filaggrin expression in the epidermis are closely coordinated.\r"

  ".W": "The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor pathway is an important mediator of keratinocyte growth in vitro and both receptor and ligand components of this pathway are abnormally expressed in hyperproliferative epidermis. The purpose of this study was to examine interactions between the EGF receptor pathway and the insulin-like growth factor I/somatomedin C (IGF-I) receptor pathway in modulating the growth of cultured normal human keratinocytes. Short-term growth of keratinocytes in a chemically defined medium demonstrated that neither EGF nor IGF-I alone could support significant keratinocyte spreading or proliferation, but that a combination of EGF with IGF-I or high-dose insulin could. IGF-I or high-dose insulin transmodulates keratinocyte EGF receptor expression via the IGF-I receptor in a dose- and time-dependent manner, increasing EGF receptor binding an average of 1.8 times up to a maximum of fourfold without altering EGF binding affinity. Staining of normal human epidermis with an IGF-I receptor specific monoclonal antibody demonstrates that IGF-I receptors localize to the basal proliferative cell compartment, suggesting that IGF-I receptor and EGF receptor pathway interactions may play a role in the regulation of epidermal growth and in the pathogenesis of hyperproliferative skin diseases.\r"

In attempting to understand this response at the molecular level, we have used fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and RNA blot hybridization to characterize the expression of the nuclear retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha, beta, and gamma genes in adult human epidermis. Size exclusion FPLC of 0.6 M NaCl nuclear extracts prepared from keratome biopsies revealed two peaks of specific [3H] retinoic acid (RA) binding at Mr 45 and 18 kDa, in agreement with the expected sizes of RAR and cellular RA binding protein. Blot hybridization analysis of total RNA extracted from keratome biopsies revealed that RAR-gamma was the predominant RAR species expressed in human epidermis, as RAR-alpha transcripts were detectable only at low levels and RAR-beta transcripts were undetectable. RAR transcripts were not induced by topical treatment with 0.1% RA cream under occlusion for 4 h or 4 d. Moreover, there was no significant difference in RAR-gamma transcript levels in normal and psoriatic epidermis. RAR-gamma transcripts were constitutively expressed not only in cultured human keratinocytes, but also in human dermal and lung fibroblasts. RAR-beta was induced by RA in dermal fibroblasts, but not in keratinocytes. RA induced IL-1 beta transcripts in keratinocytes rapidly (2 to 4 h) and at low concentrations (3 x 10(-10) M), consistent with activation of the IL-1 beta gene via RAR. These results demonstrate constitutive expression of RAR-gamma in human epidermis, and suggest that RAR-gamma is a molecular target of RA action in adult human skin.\r"

Immunocytochemistry failed to demonstrate differences in the pattern of neuropeptide innervation in psoriatic lesional skin when compared to normal skin. However, radioimmunoassay of skin biopsy extracts, both substance P and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, were significantly elevated in psoriatic lesional skin when compared with both psoriatic non-lesional and normal control skin (p less than 0.001). There was no significant difference between the plasma levels of neuropeptides in psoriatic patients compared to those of control subjects, and no significant correlation among the plasma levels of neuropeptides with the surface area of involvement with psoriasis. The finding of elevated levels of substance P and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in lesional psoriatic skin suggests that these peptides may be involved in the pathogenesis or maintenance of the psoriatic skin lesion and the development of safe and stable antagonists of these neuropeptides may have applications in the treatment of psoriasis.\r"

  ".W": "Only recently have human sweat glands been demonstrated to secrete immunoglobulins (Ig), paralleling Ig secretion in mucosal epithelia. It is well established that Ig protect mucosal membranes against infections by binding to surface structures of microorganisms. In view of these findings immunohistochemical studies were performed to determine if microbes on the skin surface are coated by Ig as proposed for mucosal bacteria and fungi. Smear preparations from the skin and oral cavity rich in micro-organisms were subjected to immunoperoxidase staining using anti-secretory component (SC), -IgA, -IgM, -IgG antibodies. An immunogold labeling technique of microbial suspensions of sweat and saliva was adapted to correlate the results on an ultrastructural level. Negative controls included unsuccessful staining for IgA in preparations obtained from an IgA-deficient patient as well as nonreactivity of subcultured microorganisms for all Ig classes or SC. Smear preparations from both the oral cavity and skin surface exhibited labeling of bacterial or fungal elements with anti-IgA, -IgM, -IgG, and -SC antibodies. Skin bacteria revealed a lower number of reactive microbes as compared to saliva. Staining intensity for the different Ig classes exhibited intra- and interindividual variations. Immunoelectronmicroscopically, Ig and SC could be detected either directly along the cell wall of coccal, coryneform, and fungal elements or on floccular and fimbrial material adhering to the bacterial surface. It is concluded that secretory Ig of the skin cover surface structures of microorganisms and thus modify their adhesional and/or infectious properties, resembling humoral surface immunity on mucous membranes.\r"

The affected animals of wild and inbred flocks of the breed Weisses Alpenschaf (WAS) have blisters of skin, oral mucosa, tongue, and esophagus at birth or within the first week of life. Exungulation occurs early, and severe erosions in the mouth lead to difficulty in feeding. Electron microscopic examination revealed sub-lamina densa splitting in natural or fresh friction blisters and absence of identifiable anchoring fibrils in clinically uninvolved skin. Antigen mapping localized laminin and collagen IV to the blister roof. Indirect immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to collagen VII, the major structural component of the anchoring fibrils, demonstrated a complete absence of reaction in clinically uninvolved tissues of the affected sheep, whereas in normal sheep a strong linear fluorescence was seen at the epithelial-mesenchymal basement membrane zone. Dermal extracts of normal sheep contained intact collagen VII, but epidermal and dermal extracts from the affected sheep lacked this collagen or its fragments in immunoblotting experiments. Based on genetic, clinical, ultrastructural, and immunochemical findings, the sheep disorder corresponds to the severe mutilating subtype of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa in humans and can be used as an animal model to investigate the human disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular and molecular events taking place during epidermal antigen exposure in sensitized individuals are principally well understood. Epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) are supposed to take up, process, and express a given foreign substance on their cell surface. The antigen is then recognized by T cells bearing the appropriate T-cell receptor (TCR). Because LC do not bear variable antigen (Ag)-specific binding sites, one could postulate that the epidermal exposure of any substance should activate LC and other cells of the skin immune system. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed immunophenotypically the cellular trafficking events in positive (n = 5) and negative epicutaneous patch-test reactions (n = 10), using a panel of monoclonal antibodies against CD1a, CD11c (Ki-M1, LeuM5), CD68 (Ki-M6), Ki-M8, and CD3 (Leu4). We can demonstrate that irrespective of whether or not an antigen will be responded to by the immune system (i.e., positive or negative test reaction), epidermal antigen exposure causes a decrease of LC density in the epidermis and simultaneously causes an increase of LC in the dermis. Moreover, monocytes and T cells immigrate into the dermis both in positive and negative patch-test reactions. As is to be expected, the degree of this cellular traffic is more pronounced in positive test reactions, which may be due to amplification mechanisms caused by antigen recognition of sensitized T cells. This finding demonstrates that human skin contains cell migration programs that ensure that any foreign substance will be accessible to the skin immune and phagocytic system.\r"

  ".W": "The glutathione S-transferases (GST) are a family of widely distributed multifunctional detoxification enzymes that catalyze the reaction between reduced glutathione and a variety of electrophiles. Of interest is the fact that several extracutaneous tissues exhibit a distinct spectrum of isozymes that are expressed in a highly controlled fashion. Despite the fact that the skin is continuously exposed to numerous injurious agents, little is known about the expression of GST isozymes and their role in metabolism of physiologic and xenobiotic substrates in cutaneous tissue. Using specific polyclonal antibodies to the Alpha, Mu, and Pi classes of GST, we identified their expression in rat, mouse, and human skin cytosol. In each species, GST isozymes expressed activities towards 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, benzo(a)pyrene 4,5-oxide, styrene 7,8-oxide, leukotriene A4, and ethacrynic acid, but not towards bromosulfophthalein and cumene hydroperoxide. Western blot analysis indicated the predominant expression of Pi isozyme in all three species. Alpha class of isozyme(s) was present only in human skin, whereas Mu class of isozyme(s) was detected only in rat and mouse skin. Similarly, in normal and transformed cultured human keratinocytes Pi was the predominant isozyme. In situ localization studies using immunohistochemical techniques confirmed the observations of Western blotting. In mouse skin, Pi and Mu isozyme(s) were found to be predominantly localized in sebaceous glands, whereas no reactivity was observed with the Alpha class of isozymes. Our data show that multiple forms of GST exist in rodent and human skin and that GST Pi is the predominant isozyme in each species. Furthermore, cutaneous GST can metabolize both endogenous substrates and foreign compounds.\r"

  ".W": "Although the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) is unknown, many immunologic abnormalities such as high levels of serum IgE and increase of IgE Fc receptor-positive lymphocytes have been demonstrated. Recently, interleukin 4 (IL-4) has been shown to induce enormously the production of IgE and to enhance the expression of IgE Fc receptor by B cells, suggesting the possible involvement of IL-4 in the pathogenesis of AD. We examined IL-4 responsiveness or interleukin 2 (IL-2) responsiveness of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 31 patients with AD, 19 healthy individuals, and seven patients with other skin diseases. We found that IL-4 responsiveness of AD was higher than that of non-AD control, although IL-2 responsiveness of AD showed no significant change. However, the value of the IL-4 responsiveness did not significantly correlate with the clinical severity, personal history of respiratory allergy, serum IgE level, or clinical course of patients with AD. The hyperresponsiveness to IL-4 detected in AD was not likely to be due to the effects of steroids or anti-mast cell drugs because the value of IL-4 responsiveness was significantly low, compared to AD, in patients with other skin diseases who were treated similarly. Because the T-cell-enriched population, but not the B-cell-enriched population, showed significant proliferation in response to exogenous IL-4 or IL-2, T cells were the main population that reacted in our proliferation assay. These results indicate that IL-4-driven proliferative response may be efficiently operative in T cells in patients with AD.\r"

Synthesized collagenous protein decreased to approximately 30% of that of normal fetal fibroblasts in both transformed cell lines, and the relative rate of collagen synthesis to total protein synthesis decreased about sixfold in KMST-6 cells and twelvefold in KMST-6-Ras cells. The m-RNA levels of type I collagen in both of these cell lines decreased to approximately 20% of that of the control fibroblasts, whereas type III collagen m-RNA levels decreased to only 9% of that of the control. The copy number of the collagen gene in both transformed cell lines was unaltered. The transcriptional rates of collagen alpha 1(I) and collagen alpha 1(III) in both cell lines decreased to 20% and 7% respectively of that of control. These data indicate that collagen synthesis was reduced at the transcriptional level in these transformed human fibroblasts.\r"

To better characterize the role of immunocompetent cells, we performed an immunohistochemical examination of these cells in LE-like skin lesions in MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mice. Skin lesions in 60 female MRL/lpr mice were monitored from onset to full development. Skin specimens from each stage were stained for epidermal Ia+ Langerhans cells (Ia(+)-LC), for Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells (Thy-1+DEC), and for the phenotype of the mononuclear cell infiltrates. The numbers of Ia(+)-LC and Thy-1+DEC were decreased markedly in the skin lesions at the later stage. However, the numbers of Ia(+)-LC were increased significantly in the central portion of lesions at an early stage and in the peripheral portion of lesions later. L3T4+ cells were predominant, and the L3T4/Lyt-2 ratio was high in dermal infiltrates at an early stage. With advancing stage, the L3T4/Lyt-2 ratio gradually decreased in dermal infiltrates, whereas the Thy-1.2/Lyt-2 ratio in lymph nodes was reversed. L3T4+ cells were especially predominant in dermal infiltrates under the epidermis with increased numbers of Ia(+)-LC. This immunohistochemical analysis of a mouse model of cutaneous LE revealed changes in immunocompetent cell populations with the evolution of skin lesions, and we conclude that Ia(+)-LC and Thy-1+DEC, as well as L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ cells, may play pathogenic roles in the development of skin lesions.\r"

In the present study, we investigated whether ultraviolet (UV) light and corticosteroids (CS) affect IL-6 production by normal (HNK) or malignant (KB) human keratinocytes. Supernatants derived from UVB (100 J/m2)- but not from UVA (100-1500 kJ/m2)-exposed EC (HNK and KB) contained significantly increased levels of IL-6 activity. This was also confirmed by Western blot analysis, resulting in specific bands at 23 kD and 27 kD. Northern blot analysis revealed an enhanced IL-6 mRNA expression after UVB exposure. Addition of hydrocortisone, prednisolone, or dexamethasone immediately after UVB irradiation significantly blocked UVB or IL-1-induced IL-6 mRNA expression and production by EC. The suppressive effect was observed at doses in the physiologic (10(-7)-10(-9) M) as well as pharmacologic (10(-5)-10(-7) M) range. In contrast, the nonactive steroid prednisone did not affect EC IL-6 mRNA expression. These findings indicate that increased IL-6 production by EC after UVB irradiation may mediate local and systemic inflammatory reactions following extensive sun exposure. Thus, the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids observed in various inflammatory diseases may be partly due to their downregulating capacity of IL-6 production.\r"

  ".W": "Benzoyl peroxide (BP), used widely in dermatologic therapy and by the food industry, is considered a tumor promoter in chemically induced skin. Tumor promoters of both the phorbol and non-phorbol type interact with protein kinase C (PKC). This enzyme, therefore, is regarded as the intracellular receptor for a number of tumor promoters. BP bears some structural resemblance to diacylglycerol (DAG) and thus may exert its action through the PKC system. Based on these observations, we have investigated the effect of BP on PKC from mouse skin. Our data show that unlike phorbol esters, which stimulate PKC (in vivo and in vitro), BP inhibits PKC. Concentration-dependent inhibition by BP is observed when PKC is stimulated by phorbol esters, diacylglycerol, phosphatidyl serine (PS), or a combination of the latter two. BP also inhibits PKC stimulated by (-) Indolactam V, a nonphorbol compound resembling the teleocidins. 3H-phorbol ester binding experiments reveal that inhibition by BP may be due to its interference with the phorbol ester binding site and consequently diacylglycerol binding. The binding data and the inability of BP to inhibit either cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase I or II imply that BP interacts with PKC, and not with the histone substrate. Results presented here clearly indicate that unlike phorbol and certain non-phorbol type of tumor promoters BP does not stimulate PKC in vitro.\r"

A significant body of evidence now exists suggesting that extracellular SC lipids are primarily responsible for this barrier. We have measured the permeability (P) and lag-time (Tlag) for water vapor transport through the SC and found that P is about 1000 times less than the values obtained for most other lipid membranes. In addition, we have measured the water partitioning into the lipid microdomain of the SC using a differential scanning calorimetry technique. These combined data provide an estimate of the diffusion coefficient (D) and diffusion pathlength (delta). The results show that the intrinsic diffusion of water is comparable to values obtained with other lipid membranes. The value obtained for delta, however, is fiftyfold greater than the sample thickness. These results are interpreted in terms of the unique morphology of the SC, where lipids form an extracellular continuum that is highly tortuous. Thus, the exceedingly low permeability of the SC may be due, in large part, to its unique morphology.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of three immunoregulatory surface antigens by epidermal keratinocytes was studied in irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), in order to assess whether keratinocytes have a modulatory role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Biopsies were taken from 48-h patch test reactions to six structurally unrelated irritants, and frozen sections immunolabeled with monoclonal antibodies to the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen, HLA-DR, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and the 88-Kd glycoprotein CD36 (OKM5), as well as to the CD3 (T cells) and CD11a (lymphocyte function associated antigen-1, LFA-1) antigens. We found that there was very limited expression of HLA-DR by keratinocytes, with no correlation between the extent of HLA-DR positivity and the degree of T cell infiltration into the epidermis and dermis, suggesting that interferon gamma may not be a significant mediator of ICD at 48 h. In contrast, keratinocytes showed extensive upregulation of ICAM-1, with an excellent spatial association between ICAM-1 expression and LFA-1 positive leucocytes in the epidermis. This indicates that keratinocyte ICAM-1 induction is not restricted to diseases in which antigen presentation is pivotal, but that it has a generalized role in cutaneous inflammatory reactions, promoting the infiltration of leucocytes into the epidermis. Immunolabeling with OKM5 revealed that CD36 is present to a variable degree on keratinocytes in normal skin. Differential changes in the pattern of keratinocyte expression occurred between irritants, in a manner that suggested that the CD36 antigen does not act as an adhesion molecule in ICD, but rather that its expression is related to the proliferative state of the epidermis. The results of this study demonstrate that immune-associated antigens are selectively expressed on the surface of keratinocytes in 48-h ICD biopsies, implying that these cells play an important regulatory role in the development of the inflammatory response to irritant chemicals.\r"

In previous studies, we showed that human resting Langerhans cells (LC) express at least two members of the \"integrins\" family of adhesive molecules, as well as the intercellular adhesion molecule-1, which is a member of the immunoglobulin-related superfamily of molecules. This latter family includes another adhesive moiety, namely, the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (LFA-3), which is the ligand for the T-lymphocyte-associated CD2 molecule, and has a broad tissue and organ distribution. In the present investigation the colloidal gold-immunoelectronmicroscopy immunostaining system and a quantitative analysis of the labeling provided decisive evidence for the weak but clear LFA-3 expression on virtually all keratinocytes (KC) and LC freshly isolated from normal human skin. Such constitutive expression of LFA-3 molecule on EC may be relevant for a number of functional interactions between LFA-3-positive EC and CD2-positive T lymphocytes within the cutaneous environment.\r"

Labelings on suspensions enriched in freshly isolated LC were carried out with an antibody recognizing the beta 1 subunit, common to all members of the VLA family, and with antibodies specific for the six different alpha subunits, alpha 1 to alpha 6. Normal human epidermal LC were all beta 1 positive, of which 60% were highly positive. By labelings with different VLA-alpha-chain MoAb, there appeared two subpopulations of LC: one positive and one negative. On average 40% of LC bore small amounts of VLA-1 and VLA-3, 53% and 77% of LC expressed moderate amounts of VLA-2 and VLA-5, respectively, and VLA-4 and VLA-6 were expressed by 67% and 90% of LC, respectively. VLA proteins are mainly extracellular matrix protein receptors. VLA-6 (laminin receptor) and VLA-5 (fibronectin receptor) are expressed mainly by LC, and in this way could subserve LC to leave the epidermal compartment through the basement membrane, to migrate throughout the fibronectin network of the dermis before migrating via the afferent lymphatics to the regional lymph nodes, where they present antigen to T cells. VLA proteins such as VLA-4, VLA-3, or VLA-2, which are found involved in cell-cell contacts, could contribute to the promotion of T-cell activation by facilitating adherence between LC and T cells.\r"

However, their major constituent, ceramides, have not been analyzed in detail in skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis that show defective water-retention and permeability-barrier function. In an attempt to assess the quantity of ceramides per unit mass of the stratum corneum in atopic dermatitis, stratum corneum sheet was removed from the forearm skin by stripping with cyanoacrylate resin and placed in hexane/ethanol extraction to yield stratum corneum lipids. The stratum corneum was dispersed by solubilization of cyanoacrylate resin with dimethylformamide, and after membrane filtration, the weight of the stratum corneum mass was measured. The ceramides were quantified by thin-layer chromatography and evaluated as microgram/mg stratum corneum. In the forearm skin of healthy individuals (n = 65), the total ceramide content significantly declined with increasing age. In atopic dermatitis (n = 32-35), there was a marked reduction in the amount of ceramides in the lesional forearm skin compared with those of healthy individuals of the same age. Interestingly, the non-lesional skin also exhibited a similar and significant decrease of ceramides. Among six ceramide fractions, ceramide 1 was most significantly reduced in both lesional and non-lesional skin. These findings suggest that an insufficiency of ceramides in the stratum corneum is an etiologic factor in atopic dry skin.\r"

Subjects with positive family histories of hypertension increased significantly in body weight (from 81.9 +/- 11.5 kg to 89.5 +/- 11.4 kg, P less than 0.001) compared to subjects with negative family histories of hypertension (from 79.9 +/- 10.8 kg to 80.7 +/- 12.2 kg, NS). Their blood pressure did not differ initially (137 +/- 12/75 +/- 11 mmHg vs. 135 +/- 8/72 +/- 9 mmHg), but was reduced in subjects without family histories of hypertension (to 125 +/- 3/68 +/- 13 mmHg) in the follow-up examination. At follow-up, body mass index showed a positive correlation with blood pressure among subjects with positive family histories of hypertension (r = 0.77, P less than 0.001). At baseline, subjects with hypertensive fathers had significantly higher intraerythrocyte sodium levels than subjects with normotensive parents. At re-examination 5 years later, this difference was no longer present. We conclude that normotensive subjects with positive family histories of hypertension are predisposed to gain weight rather than to show an increase in blood pressure at this age. Normalization of intracellular sodium content, as found in the present study, could be a consequence of this weight gain and the ensuing metabolic adaption.\r"

The maximal intima-media thickness (IMT) varied between 0.48 mm and 4.09 mm (mean value +/- SD, 0.94 mm +/- 0.38 mm). Age (standardized partial coefficient, beta = 0.238, P less than 0.0001), ambulatory pulse pressure (beta = 0.130, P less than 0.0001), cigarette-years of smoking (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), serum LDL cholesterol concentration (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), history of ischaemic heart disease (beta = 0.125, P less than 0.0001), pre-exercise systolic blood pressure (beta = 0.070, P = 0.0113) and diabetes (beta = 0.068, P = 0.0072) were most strongly associated with IMT. This study confirms the role of systolic blood pressure, smoking and serum LDL cholesterol levels as major risk factors for increased carotid intima-media thickness.\r"

Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at randomization and at the end of each 4-week double-blind treatment period. The doses of felodipine given were 5 mg b.i.d. for 2 weeks followed by 10 mg b.i.d. for a further 2 weeks. Blood pressure was significantly reduced during felodipine treatment, whereas heart rate remained unaltered. HbA1c and fasting insulin levels did not change during the treatment periods. Fasting and maximal blood glucose levels were not altered between any of the treatment periods. However, there was a small but statistically significant increase (median increase 4%) in the area under the glucose concentration vs. time curve after felodipine as compared to placebo treatment. This increase was not considered to be clinically significant in the short term, but the finding merits further investigation in a rigorous long-term study.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to clarify the effect of bile acid sequestrant treatment on the total biliary output rates of cholesterol, phospholipids and bile acids in man, and to correlate these changes with the alterations in plasma lipoprotein levels. For this purpose nine healthy, normolipidaemic men were treated with 16 g of cholestyramine daily over a period of 4 weeks, and the biliary secretion rates were measured by a duodenal perfusion technique. Resin therapy, which profoundly increases de novo synthesis of bile acids, resulted in a lowering of total plasma cholesterol levels, mainly due to a 35% reduction in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and in a 33% increase in plasma triglyceride levels, reflecting enhanced very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride concentrations; high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels did not change. However, these lipoprotein changes did not correlate with any alterations in biliary lipid output. Total hepatic secretion rates of the biliary lipids remained generally unchanged during treatment, with a tendency towards lower cholesterol output, resulting in a lower molar percentage of cholesterol in hepatic bile, 3.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.2 mol %. This is probably due to an increased rate of conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the hepatocyte. It is concluded that, in man, the liver may adapt well to changes in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, thereby maintaining output rates of biliary lipids at a relatively constant level.\r"

  ".W": "Steady-state serum digoxin concentrations were determined and related to renal function in 62 hospitalized patients 70-93 years of age. Renal function was assessed by serum creatinine concentration, and creatinine clearance was estimated by a formula employing the serum creatinine concentration and adjusting for body weight, sex and age. The steady-state digoxin concentration was inversely related to the estimated creatinine clearance. As there was no correlation between serum creatinine and age, a simplified estimation of creatinine clearance capacity, disregarding age and sex and allowing only for body weight and serum creatinine, was applied. It is suggested that this simplified calculation is suitable for bedside use. If the body weight/serum creatinine ratio is less than 0.5 (kg x 1/mumol), approximately one-third of our patients would have digoxin concentrations that are close to or above the upper reference limit (2.6 nmol l-1) at the maintenance dose of 0.13 mg digoxin daily. A digoxin dose of 0.07 mg daily thus appears to be suitable for many patients aged greater than 70 years when the body weight/serum creatinine ratio is less than 0.5, and also when the serum creatinine level is normal or only slightly elevated. The half-life of digoxin in serum was determined in 12 patients for whom digoxin treatment was withdrawn due to clinical signs of intoxication, and these half-lives were markedly prolonged: 3.5-6 days at a body weight/serum creatinine ratio of 0.5-0.3. The seven patients with prolonged half-lives had serum creatinine concentrations in the range of 80-140 mumol l-1.\r"

Of 36 patients in sinus rhythm, one developed paroxysmal AF and one developed persistent AF during a median follow-up period of 20 months. Thus the incidence of new AF was 5% per year. Eighteen patients died before scheduled echocardiographic follow-up, but in the remaining subjects the left atrial dimension did not change significantly: the median increment was 1 mm in 20 patients who sustained sinus rhythm vs 2 mm in 16 patients with chronic AF (P greater than 0.05). Although left atrial dilatation may cause AF and vice versa, this study demonstrated that the incidence of new AF is low, despite the fact that the left atrial dimension is substantially increased. Similarly, AF per se does not appear to have any major impact on the left atrial dimension.\r"

The patients with hypertriglyceridaemia were more obese [body mass index 29.0 (24.6-33.8) vs. 25.7 (21.9-30.1) kg m-2, P less than 0.05] and demonstrated impaired glucose disposal in response to exogenous insulin at isoglycaemia [insulin sensitivity index, SIp 0.7 (0.27-2.5) vs. 2.4 (0.62-5.1) ml m-2 min per mU l-1, P less than 0.001]. Basal non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and glycerol concentrations were higher and were suppressed to a lesser extent during isoglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia. Fasting glucose and apolipoprotein B concentrations were higher in the hypertriglyceridaemic patients, but lipoprotein lipase activities were similar in the two groups. When the effect of obesity was removed (by weight-matching six normotriglyceridaemic with seven hypertriglyceridaemic patients) basal NEFA and glycerol concentrations and the suppression of NEFA in response to insulin remained significantly different between the two groups. We propose that defects in both the glucoregulatory and antilipolytic actions of insulin contribute to mild fasting hypertriglyceridaemia in NIDDM, and that these defects cannot be attributed solely to obesity. These disorders of insulin action may also have important implications for the postprandial metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and hence atherogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to compare the degree of hypoglycaemia, the hypoglycaemic symptom score and counterregulatory responses to equimolar amounts of intravenously administered porcine and semisynthetic human insulin in a double-blind crossover study in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. After overnight stabilization of blood glucose to approximately 6 mmol l-1, insulin was infused from 06.00 hours at such a rate as to keep the blood glucose concentration constant at 6 mmol l-1. At 09.00 hours hypoglycaemia was induced by increasing the infusion rate to give a blood glucose level of 2 mmol l-1 within about 60 min. The individual infusion rate from the first test was repeated in the second test, 1 week later. Blood glucose minimum levels were 2.1 (range, 1.3-2.9) and 2.1 (1.3-2.8) mmol l-1 for porcine and human insulin, respectively. The insulin concentrations at blood nadirs were 107 (66-180) and 107 (56-184) pmol l-1, respectively, for porcine compared to human insulin (NS). Symptom scores at minimum blood glucose concentrations were 43 and 46, respectively, with a maximal difference in intensity of 1 point in each patient. There were no statistical differences in the counterregulatory responses of glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, growth hormone, prolactin, beta-endorphine or in serum-potassium decreases. Patients were unable to discriminate between the two forms of insulin. It is concluded that there are no differences between porcine and semisynthetic insulin with regard to glucose fall, hormonal counterregulation or symptom scores, when the two forms of insulin are administered intravenously in equimolar amounts.\r"

At a fixed velocity, abrasion ring width increased with increasing projectile diameter but decreased in proportion to the central defect diameter. For fixed-diameter projectiles, very slow and high velocities produced minimal abrasion width. Maximal abrasion width occurred at intermediate velocities. The authors postulate that abrasion width is a function of the ratio of projectile velocity and the maximum deformation velocity of the target skin. The largest abrasion width occurs when the ratio is one. Using a projectile velocity known to produce maximum abrasion width at an initial warm temperature, then decreasing the target deformation velocity by cooling, produced the expected results of decreasing abrasion width.\r"

In this study, the dose-concentration-time relationships of amitriptyline in overdose were modeled with discriminant analysis, with an evolutionary heuristic search program, and with a decision-tree model based on the entropy of uncertainty of classification. The computer models all used the same data from dogs administered treatment (80 mg/kg), toxic (250 mg/kg), or fatal (500 mg/kg) doses directly into the surgically isolated duodenum. All the models achieved a high degree of success (77 to 93%) in assigning records to the high-, low-, or middle-dose groups. Two of the models gave a probability of the assignment. Results of this analysis suggest that blood amitriptyline and nortriptyline concentrations are most useful in estimating dose in acute amitriptyline overdose.\r"

These structures are known to undergo regressive changes due to gradual attrition, mechanical abrasion, or chemical erosion. Forensic science has suggested that significance be placed on some forms of their loss as indicators of age, oral habits, and alignment of individual teeth. The dental identification of victims of a Vietnam War military aircraft crash is presented. The unusual pattern of perikymata change on two of the teeth suggests the antemortem existence of a removable partial denture. These findings support the exclusionary conclusions.\r"

Autopsies revealed that all the victims had carbon particles in the trachea and bronchi. Thus, all the victims must have inhaled fire products in the burning aircraft cabin. Six victims had concentrations of carbon monoxide or cyanide in the blood that were neither fatal nor incapacitating; therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that these six victims survived for a comparatively short time and that there may have been other causes, in addition to toxic fumes, for their deaths. The other 48 victims must have survived long enough in the fire to accumulate incapacitating or fatal concentrations of carbon monoxide or cyanide or both. The effects of these substances found in the blood of each of the 48 victims must have combined to produce an insurmountable impediment to escape from the aircraft.\r"

These are (1) acute myocardial infarction in a minority of cases; (2) myocardial ischemia, without infarction, which is initiated either by (a) an exertion-induced increase in myocardial oxygen demand or (b) an acute coronary event often involving plaque degeneration and platelet aggregation; and (3) a primary arrhythmia, usually resulting from altered electrical conduction in the setting of a previous myocardial infarction.\r"

All the cases had positive toxicological screening for cocaine or metabolites or both in the mother at delivery or in the infant at birth, or both. There were no instances of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS, or \"crib death\"). Pathologic and toxicologic, as well as birth, developmental, and social data are presented. An integrated medical, public health, law enforcement, and educational policy to prevent or at least ameliorate these tragic cases, now approaching epidemic proportions, has yet to be developed. A careful obstetrical history and examination of the mother, indication on the birth certificate of maternal drug abuse, and notification of health authorities (by birth certificate checking, among other ways) may send an early warning message to providers for intercession. Active ingestion/injection and passive inhalation by older children and teenagers require more intensive monitoring and aggressive interaction by pediatricians, social workers, school authorities, and employers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The author proposes that this ratio is dependent upon the time course of absorption and distribution, as has been observed for vitreous humor, but with a more rapid equilibration. Muscle tissue was also analyzed in another group of cases found to be positive for one or more drugs in blood. The concentrations of the drugs in muscle varied from none detected to 6.5 times those in blood and seemed to be dependent on the time course between ingestion and death, as well as on the nature of the drug. For most common basic drugs, the ratios were often near unity. Muscle is proposed as a useful alternative specimen to postmortem blood.\r"

The combination of depressive and anxiety disorders also was frequent in the total sample (61%). Current MMPIs of three groups with psychiatric diagnosis were compared with those of POWs who had no diagnoses and with a group of Minnesota normal men. Profile elevations for the groups, from highest to lowest, were: POWs with chronic PTSD, POWs with recovery from PTSD, POWs with other psychiatric diagnoses, POWs with no disorders, and Minnesota normal men. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatic concerns combined with the personality styles of suppression and denial characterize the current adjustment of negatively affected POWs.\r"

Factors relevant to belief formation and maintenance were investigated. Deluded subjects requested less information before reaching a decision and were more ready to change their estimates of the likelihood of an event when confronted with potentially disconfirmatory information. No differences were found between the two diagnostic groups of deluded subjects. The results are discussed in light of prevailing theories of the importance of abnormal experience rather than reasoning biases in the formation and maintenance of delusional beliefs. It is suggested that a reasoning abnormality is involved, which may coexist with perceptual abnormalities.\r"

These analyses showed that there was not a statistically significant change in percentage of explained variance when length of hospitalization was entered into the multiple regression equations. On the basis of these analyses, it was concluded that the association between increasing deficit and length of hospitalization experienced by schizophrenic patients is no greater than what would be anticipated on the basis of aging.\r"

Each experimental diet contained 8% dietary fiber by weight; all animals were killed in a nonfasted state. After 4 wk, final body weight and liver cholesterol were similar in fiber-free controls and in rats fed diets containing cellulose, pectin, oat bran or wheat bran. Pectin-fed animals has significantly lower plasma cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels, and exhibited significantly higher hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity than did the fiber-free control group. In addition, plasma triglyceride concentrations were lowest in pectin-fed animals. These multiple effects on lipid metabolism were not observed when oat bran, containing one-third soluble fiber, was used. Although total plasma cholesterol levels in wheat bran-fed animals were not different from those in the fiber-free controls or the cellulose-oat bran-fed animals, the LDL cholesterol level was significantly higher than in fiber-free controls or pectin-fed animals. This study demonstrate that dietary fibers included in the diet of rats are able to alter nonfasting lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoproteins and that pectin, a soluble fiber, was most effective in lowering plasma cholesterol levels.\r"

Individual foods were incorporated into a folate-free amino acid-based diet alone (250 micrograms folate/kg diet from food) or mixed with folic acid (125 micrograms folate from food + 125 micrograms folic acid) to evaluate folate bioavailability and effects of food matrix. Beef liver and orange juice folates were as available as folic acid, whereas those of wheat germ were less bioavailable. Folates of peas and spinach were also less available than folic acid using liver and serum folate concentrations and total liver folate as response criteria, but they were not lower when based on growth and erythrocyte folate concentrations. Lima bean, mushroom and collard folates were as available as folic acid using four of five response criteria. Folate bioavailability of all foods generally exceeded 70%. All response criteria gave approximately equivalent results, indicating that growth and tissue folate levels are appropriate criteria. No food matrix effects were observed for any food except lima beans. Foods rich in polyglutamyl folates were less bioavailable than those of foods rich in short-chain folates.\r"

In Experiment A, the animals were fed RRR-alpha- or all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate at two different levels, 0.035 and 0.200 g/kg diet, for 2.5 mo. In Experiment B, rats were first depleted of vitamin E for 7 wk then fed a diet containing 0.035 g/kg diet of RRR-alpha- or all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate. In the latter experiment, rats were killed after 3, 7, 17, 31 or 45 d to study the time course of the discrimination. At the end of both experiments, levels of alpha-tocopherol were measured in plasma and tissues. The results showed a preferential uptake of the natural RRR-alpha-tocopherol by the majority of the tissues. The preference is small and in some tissues is not immediately manifested. The greatest discrimination in the tissues examined was found in red blood cells; the levels of alpha-tocopherol accumulated with the RRR-alpha-tocopherol diet were four to six times that accumulated with all-rac-alpha-tocopherol diet. For all other tissues, this ratio was between 1.0 and 1.5. These results indicate that tissues have a mechanism for alpha-tocopherol uptake, but this mechanism is not entirely specific for RRR-alpha-tocopherol.\r"

Although lung was the target organ as indicated by the increased lung:body weight ratio in all hyperoxia-exposed rats regardless of dietary regimen, 85% oxygen exposure seemed to impose a stress on the whole animal as indicated by decreased feed intake and body weight in ad libitum-fed rats. Hyperoxia exposure superimposed on Zn deficiency did not further reduce the feed intake or body weight of Zn-deficient rats. After 7 d of hyperoxia exposure, the Zn-repleted and ad libitum-fed groups consistently had increased activity of lung CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), glutathione peroxidase and catalase; but changes in CuZnSOD activity were not related to lung Cu or Zn concentrations. Although Zn-deficient and pair-fed rats were unable to increase CuZnSOD activity, they had an increased lung Zn concentration compared with their air-exposed counterparts. Hyperoxia exposure also caused an increase in ceruloplasmin activity of pair-fed and ad libitum-fed control rats. We concluded that dietary Zn repletion started at the beginning of 85% oxygen exposure was effective for increasing the activity of the lung oxygen free radical defense enzymes, thus preventing hyperoxia-induced lung damage in Zn-deficient rats.\r"

Exposure to 85% oxygen seemed to impose a stress on the whole animal as indicated by two physiological responses, decreased food intake and decreased body weight of ad libitum-fed rats. However, all rats exposed to 85% oxygen, including the Cu-deficient group, were able to survive 1 wk of hyperoxia exposure. The target organ specificity for hyperoxia exposure was in the lung as indicated by the increased lung:body weight ratio in all hyperoxia-exposed rats regardless of dietary treatment. All dietary treatment groups exposed to hyperoxia had a similar increase in lung:body weight ratio, but none of the hyperoxia-exposed rats had MRI-detectable lung damage. After 7 d of hyperoxia exposure, all dietary treatment groups, including the Cu-deficient rats, had increased activity of lung CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), but changes in CuZnSOD activity were not related to lung Cu or Zn concentrations. We propose that the ability to increase CuZnSOD activity is the most important factor of the enzymatic oxygen free radical defense system for protection against hyperoxia-induced lung damage detected by MRI. Even though lung Cu concentration was decreased in Cu deficiency, it seems that Cu-deficient rats are still able to increase lung CuZnSOD activity in response to 85% oxygen exposure.\r"

Pups were weaned either to the diet of their dam or to the diet fed to dams in the other treatment group in a crossover design. At 7 wk of age, Cu-deficient rats were characterized by low tissue Cu and an enlarged heart with increased levels of dopamine (DA) and decreased levels of norepinephrine (NE). These changes resulting from Cu deficiency were independent of gender. In vivo synthesis of cardiac NE from DA in Cu-adequate rats was significantly greater than in Cu-deficient rats. Turnover of cardiac NE was estimated from the temporal change in the specific activity of [3H]NE. Fractional turnover rates (percentage per hour) of cardiac NE were similar in both dietary groups, although the cardiac turnover of NE (nanograms per hour) was 1.4-fold higher in Cu-adequate rats than in Cu-deficient rats. Repletion of Cu-deficient rats with dietary Cu increased the total amount of cardiac NE to 78 and 93% of control values after 1 and 2 d, respectively. Significant changes in the quantities of NE and DA in the heart of rats whose intake of Cu was restricted from birth were first detected at 4 wk of age, but cardiac hypertrophy was not observed until 5 wk of age. The data support the proposal that the altered levels of DA and NE in the heart of Cu-deficient rats are primarily the result of decreased activity of DA-B-monooxygenase and demonstrate that Cu supplementation rapidly repletes cardiac NE in Cu-deficient rats. Moreover, changes in the concentrations of NE and DA in the heart precede and may contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

Blood was collected before and after 1, 2 and 3 mo of supplementation. Compliance was confirmed by the significant increase in plasma EPA and DHA in all women. Older women had a significantly higher increase in EPA and DHA than did young women (10-fold increases in EPA and 2.5-fold increases in DHA vs. 8-fold in EPA and 2-fold in DHA for older and young women, respectively). The decrease in the arachidonic acid:EPA ratio was more dramatic in the older women. Plasma total triglycerides (TG) decreased significantly, and the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids was significantly (P less than 0.01) increased. Plasma vitamin E levels did not change significantly after supplementation; however, after 3 mo of supplementation by young women, plasma vitamin E was significantly lower than after 1 mo. The vitamin E: TG ratio was significantly increased and vitamin E:(EPA + DHA) significantly decreased. All women showed a significant increase in plasma lipid peroxide through mo 2 of supplementation. After 2 mo, older women had significantly higher lipid peroxide levels than young women. The lipid peroxide:TG ratio, which declined by mo 3, was still significantly higher than baseline. These data indicate that although long-term fish oil supplementation may be beneficial in reducing plasma total TG, susceptibility of plasma lipids to free radical attack is potentiated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Other rats were gavaged with approximately 220 KBq (6 microCi) of 47Ca; daily fecal and urine collections were made and periodic whole body radioactivity determined. Femurs were removed and analyzed. Calcium retention and balance were not affected by Mg in young rats. In old rats low Mg intake increased apparent Ca balance. Young rats retained about 3.25 times more of the original dose of 47Ca than did old rats. Young rats retained more 47Ca in the femur than did old rats; Mg intake had little effect. Aging accelerated Ca turnover rate, and whole body retention data suggest that adequate Mg does not significantly reduce Ca turnover.\r"

  ".W": "Adaptive responses of brush border hydrolases and crypt cell proliferation were measured in the jejunum and ileum of 4-mo-old adult and 28-mo-old senescent male Wistar rats. Responses were measured after rats were deprived of food and then refed with a normoprotein diet (17% protein) or an isoenergetic high protein diet (70% protein). The young rats deprived of food then refed for 18 h with the high protein diet showed better body weight recovery than did old animals. Withholding food for 48 h induced a more pronounced drop of sucrase activity in the intestine of the old rats relative to young rats. Refeeding the high protein diet caused a better recovery of sucrase activity in the jejunum of young rats relative to senescent rats. In the aged animals, sucrase activity in the jejunum remained significantly lower after refeeding both diets. Compared with nourished controls, aged rats showed enzyme activity to be completely restored in the ileum. The high protein diet increased aminopeptidase activity in the jejunum and ileum of young rats, in contrast to the senescent rats in which the increase of enzyme activity was restricted to the ileum. In the jejunum of aged rats, the cell migration rate from crypt base to villus tip was reduced after refeeding, but no age-related changes were observed in the ileum. Our results indicate that the jejunum of senescent rats exhibits reduced adaptive capacities that may be partly compensated by enhanced ileal functions.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that maternal protein deprivation in early pregnancy retards body and organ growth of 63-d (midterm) pig fetuses, 16 primiparous domestic four-way crossbred swine were fed a diet adequate in protein (13% protein) (A) or a protein-restricted (0.7% protein) diet (PR) from d 1 to 63 of pregnancy or to parturition. Maternal body weight, plasma protein, hematocrit, and heart and spleen weights were reduced, and indices of body fatness were increased by the PR diet. Fetal body weights were reduced and fetal placental weights were increased at d 63 by protein restriction. Length from crown to rump and weights of liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and cerebrum were lower in PR than in A fetuses. Concentrations of protein, RNA and DNA in liver, cerebrum and longissimus muscle were unaffected by maternal diet, but total amounts of all three constituents in liver and cerebrum were lower in PR than in A. Relative organ weights were similar in A and PR fetuses except that kidneys and gastrointestinal tract were greater in A fetuses. Newborn body weights and absolute organ weights were generally lower in PR than in A, but relative weights were similar. The observed reduction in body and organ weights and amounts of protein, RNA and DNA in 63-d fetuses and newborn progeny of PR swine establishes that the stunting effect of maternal protein restriction can be initiated by midterm, preceding the period of most rapid accretion of body tissues during prenatal life in the pig.\r"

Rats aged 2 and 19 mo were fed a liquid diet containing 36% of total energy as ethanol or pair-fed a diet containing isoenergetic carbohydrate in place of ethanol. After 3 wk older rats had lower serum retinol (P = 0.04) and higher vitamin A concentrations in liver (P = 0.0001), esophagus (P = 0.0001) and the proximal (P = 0.03) and distal (P = 0.0001) colon than younger animals. Hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450, retinyl ester hydrolase (REH) and cellular retinol-binding protein (cRBP) were significantly reduced; acyl coenzyme A: retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) was increased; and alcohol (retinol) dehydrogenase (ADH) activity was unchanged with age. Ethanol ingestion increased serum retinol as well as esophageal and colonic vitamin A levels in both age groups. Hepatic cRBP decreased further in the older rats with ethanol feeding, but no change was noted in the percentage of hepatic vitamin A as retinol or retinyl esters. Ethanol ingestion decreased REH (P = 0.0001) and ARAT activities (P = 0.02) and increased cytochrome P-450 (P = 0.04) but had no effect on the activity of ADH in either age group. These data indicate that, regardless of age, chronic ethanol ingestion significantly alters the tissue distribution of vitamin A; however, ethanol reduced cRBP levels only in older rats.\r"

  ".W": "Malnutrition is associated with defects in connective tissue metabolism such as altered growth and wound healing. Because collagen is the major protein in most tissues, we determined the threshold for induction of altered collagen production by partial food restriction in rats. Groups of animals were fasted 2 or 4 d or were fed 20-100% of a predetermined food intake for 4 to 8 d. Collagen and noncollagen protein production in articular cartilage were determined using purified collagenase digestion of collagen labeled for 2 h in vitro with [3H]proline. Significant decreases in collagen (P less than 0.01) were seen in rats after 4 d of 40% (weight-losing rats) or after 8 days of 80% (weight-gaining rats) ad libitum intake. Collagen production decreased with both duration and degree of food deprivation; after 8 d of 20% intake, collagen was less than 10% that of controls fed ad libitum (P less than 0.001). In contrast, noncollagen protein production was significantly decreased only after 4 or 8 d of less than 40% intake (weight-losing rats). Maximum suppression of noncollagen protein was to approximately 65% of levels in controls fed ad libitum (P less than 0.01) and was not further reduced in fasted rats. Insulin-like growth factor-I levels were significantly decreased with duration and severity of diet in parallel with changes in collagen. The degree and sensitivity of altered collagen production to small changes in food intake suggest close regulation of this peptide and a potential role for decreased collagen synthesis in connective tissues during mild states of undernutrition.\r"

DHEA increased total hepatic mitochondrial protein twofold; clofibrate increased total hepatic peroxisomal protein more than fivefold. Both DHEA and clofibrate administration increased enzyme activities, immunoreactive protein, messenger RNA levels and transcription rates for the carnitine acyltransferases. Transcription rates and messenger RNA concentration for both carnitine acyltransferases correlated with the increases in activity.

Their duodenal chyme contained only 20-50% of the enzymatic activities of animals fed bovine serum albumin (BSA) as test protein. However, both tryptic and chymotryptic activities had considerable resistance to low- and high-molecular-weight inhibitors of serine proteinases. In particular, the tryptic activity demonstrated a high degree of inhibitor resistance. Human alpha 1-antitrypsin and lima bean inhibitor in amounts that inhibited bovine serum albumin-induced trypsin completely caused only 2-12% inhibition of the raw soybean-induced tryptic activity. The inhibitor-resistant tryptic and chymotryptic activities after raw soybean instillation might be caused by the Bowman-Birk and Kunitz trypsin inhibitors. The physiologic significance of an inhibitor-resistant trypsin might be to assure activation of other pancreatic proenzymes. The results of the present rat experiments confirm the previous findings of inhibitor-resistant trypsin in humans.\r"

To determine the metabolic fate of dietary carnitine in humans, we administered orally a tracer dose of [methyl-3H]L-carnitine with a meal to subjects who had been adapted to a low-carnitine diet or a high-carnitine diet. Urinary and fecal excretion of radiolabeled carnitine and metabolites was monitored for 5 to 11 d following administration of the test dose. Total radioactive metabolites excreted ranged from 13 to 34% (low carnitine diet) and 27 to 46% (high carnitine diet) of the ingested tracer. Major metabolites found were [3H]trimethylamine N-oxide (8 to 39% of the administered dose; excreted primarily in urine) and [3H]gamma-butyrobetaine (0.09 to 8% of the administered dose; excreted primarily in feces). Urinary excretion of total carnitine was 42 to 95% (high carnitine diet) and 190 to 364% (low carnitine diet) of intake. These results indicate that oral carnitine is 54 to 87% bioavailable from normal Western diets; the percentage of intake absorbed is related to the quantity ingested.\r"

Subjects supplemented their diets with 2.4 g of (n-3) fatty acid/d for 3 mo. Blood was collected before and after 1, 2 and 3 mo of supplementation. The (n-3) fatty acid supplementation reduced total interleukin (IL)-1 beta synthesis by 48% in young women but by 90% in older women; tumor necrosis factor was reduced by 58% in young and 70% in older women. Interleukin-6 was reduced in young women by 30% but by 60% in older women. Older women produced less IL-2 and had lower mitogenic responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) than young women prior to (n-3) fatty acid supplementation. The (n-3) fatty acid supplementation reduced IL-2 production in both groups; however, this reduction was significant only in older women. The PHA-stimulated mitogenic response was significantly reduced by (n-3) fatty acid in older women (36%). Thus, long-term (n-3) fatty acid supplementation reduced cytokine production in young women and cytokine production and T cell mitogenesis in older women. The reduction was more dramatic in older women than in young women. Although (n-3) fatty acid-induced reduction in cytokine production may have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, its suppression of IL-2 production and lymphocyte proliferation in older women may not be desirable.\r"

Specific antibody production was low at 30 d of age for both vitamin A-depleted rats and control rats. Between 30 and 45 d of age, antibody production increased considerably in normal rats; however, the response of vitamin A-depleted rats was only 22% (P less than or equal to 0.001) that of controls at 35 d of age and 8% that of controls (P less than or equal to 0.001) for 45-d-old rats. Lymphocyte populations were examined by flow cytometry. The numbers of immunoglobulin M- and immunoglobulin D-positive cells changed with age, but not as a result of dietary treatment. The numbers of total T cells or helper and suppressor T cell subsets did not differ with age or with vitamin A status. These studies showed that the normal antibody response to pneumococcal polysaccharide develops rapidly after 30 d of age in the rat, that this antibody response is impaired even during the early stages of vitamin A deficiency, and that impaired antibody production does not seem to be accompanied by quantitative differences in splenic lymphocyte populations.\r"

Rats were given a single subcutaneous injection of DMH (200 mg/kg body weight) 2 wk before they were fed purified diets containing 5% fat and four different levels of calcium (as calcium gluconate). After 8 mo, the following incidences of colon tumors (total) were seen: 0.2% Ca, 56%; 0.5% Ca [National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) recommended level], 75%; 1.0% Ca, 61%; 2.0% Ca, 41%. Thus, rats fed calcium at levels above or below the NAS/NRC recommendation had lower tumor incidences. The total tumor incidence and the incidence of adenocarcinomas (with or without invasion) were not significantly affected by calcium, but the incidences of benign adenomatous polyps and of distal colon tumors were significantly affected. Autoradiographic examination of [3H]thymidine-treated rats revealed that the level of calcium did not significantly alter the cell kinetic indices in the distal colon. In the proximal colon, however, the 0.2% Ca group had a significantly larger proliferative zone, with significantly more labeled cells present at the bottom of the colon crypt. Mineral analysis of tibias and serum samples revealed that rats fed higher levels of calcium had lower bone Fe and serum Mg contents, but no significant trends were seen for Ca, P, Zn or Cu. Therefore, increasing or decreasing the calcium content above or below the NAS/NRC recommendation (supplemented to low fat diets) during the promotional phase of colon carcinogenesis altered the tumor incidence, but the effect was confined to the distal colon and to benign adenomatous polyps.\r"

Other aspects of fat consumption, specifically hidden fats, such as saturated fats, have only recently been explored, and are known to a limited segment of the population at risk. Negligence and warranty theories are too narrow to encompass this situation, wherein the benefits and risks of a product are not well defined and not easily separable. Some warning about the dangers resulting from fat ingestion is necessary, but may be adequately dispensed by ingredient labeling. If consumers are aware of the potential for harm, then they are assuming a substantial portion of the risk. How risk-free can we, or should we, make our society? The marketplace is the appropriate venue for determining the acceptance of saturated-fat-containing products by our society. Clear and open labeling policies will allow consumers to weigh the relative advantages and disadvantages of lower fat intake. Warnings of fat content need not be extreme, but should disclose the possible physiological outcome of the heavy ingestion of saturated fat.\r"

These patients were 6% of the 975 patients with invasive H. influenzae type b infection identified by active surveillance in Dallas County, Texas, during a 6 1/2-year period. The clinical assessment of \"ill\" appearance and persistent fever (greater than or equal to 38.0 degrees C) on the return visit were the two most useful variables in identifying patients at risk of continuing infection. Among 25 (42%) patients who were considered \"ill\" (febrile or afebrile), 20 (80%) had continuing invasive infection and 14 (56%) had a subsequent culture that was positive for H. influenzae type b. Among 8 patients who were considered \"well\" but who remained febrile, 3 (38%) had continuing infection, including 1 (13%) patient with a second culture that was positive. By contrast, among 27 (45%) patients who were considered \"well\" and who were afebrile, continuing invasive infection was identified in only 2 (7%) patients, and all repeat cultures were negative. These results suggest that when patients return for reevaluation of H. influenzae type b bacteremia, clinical assessment by an experienced physician, together with the febrile status of the patient, can identify those at high versus low risk of continuing invasive infection and thus guide the extent of diagnostic reevaluation.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to compare prospectively the frequency, nature, and severity of infections in children participating in three types of child care arrangements: home care, group care (two to six children), and day care (seven or more children). Children were enrolled at birth and observed for at least 36 months. The families were telephoned every 2 weeks to record on a standardized form the type and severity of illness during the previous interval. Children remaining in their original child care group for 1, 2, or 3 years were compared with regard to the frequency and severity of illness. Each child care group had the highest number of infections in year 2. Children in day care had more respiratory infections during each year than children in home care, but the magnitude of the differences decreased in year 3. When the child care groups were compared for the proportion of children with more than six illness per year or more than 60 days of respiratory illness per year, significant differences observed in years 1 and 2 for day care children compared with home care children were no longer significant in year 3. We conclude that there is a trend toward stabilized or decreased rates of infection, duration of illness, and risk of hospitalization for children remaining in day care for 3 years.\r"

Twenty low birth weight infants were followed for 16 weeks from the time of hospital discharge. Growth (weight, length, and head circumference) and biochemical responses (total protein, prealbumin, retinol-binding protein, and blood urea nitrogen values) were similar in the two groups of infants. Plasma amino acids reflected the differences in protein intakes and were similar to previously reported values for premature infants fed human milk or formula. These results demonstrate similar growth and biochemical responses in preterm infants fed a standard infant formula and a formula with a protein content closer to that of human milk.\r"

The formula was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and with a sensitive enzyme-linked inhibition immunoassay, and it was judged to be safe for clinical trials in children allergic to cow milk. Twenty-five such children underwent double-blind placebo-controlled oral food challenges with 10 gm of powdered cow milk and casein hydrolysate formula. All children were highly atopic and had positive skin prick reactions to cow milk. No patient reacted to placebo during a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge. Two patients lost their allergy to cow milk and did not react during the challenge; the remaining patients reacted with a variety of cutaneous, respiratory, and gastrointestinal symptoms within 15 to 90 minutes of challenge. All children tolerated the blinded challenge to the casein hydrolysate and were fed the hydrolysate openly without difficulty. We conclude that this casein hydrolysate is generally safe to feed to children with immediate hypersensitivity to cow milk. We recommend that all infant formulas promoted as \"hypoallergenic\" be tested in milk-allergic patients to assess their allergenic potential, in addition to standard nutritional evaluation and animal testing for antigenicity.\r"

Rice cereal was reasonably well absorbed (84.0% to 95.8%) by seven of the eight infants. The study was repeated in seven of the infants after they had recovered. Our results indicated that rice cereal is well absorbed by young infants with acute diarrhea and that it is an adequate nutrient supplement for this patient population.\r"

In all the children, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated from the plasma clearance of chromium 51-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, both at the end of treatment and at a median follow-up of 2 years 6 months after treatment was stopped (range 18 months to 7 years). In 21 children, serum magnesium level was also measured at follow-up. Median age at diagnosis was 15 months (range 13 days to 13 years 8 months), and median cumulative doses of cisplatin was 500 mg/m2 (range 120 to 1860 mg/m2). In 22 of 24 children with an end-of-treatment GFR of less than 80 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the median improvement in GFR at follow-up was 22 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (range 2 to 56 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Hypomagnesemia was found in 6 of 21 children and was independent of GFR. No significant correlation was found between improvement in renal function and total cisplatin dose, age, gender, tumor type, or associated nephrotoxic medication. We conclude that most children have some recovery from cisplatin glomerular toxicity, especially if damage is not severe, but that hypomagnesemia may persist.\r"

Antiplatelet autoantibodies were detected in 26 (72.2%) of 36 children with ongoing TP, 15 (48.4%) of 31 children with TP in the past, and 12 (66.7%) of 18 adults with TP. All children with high AAb ratios (greater than 5 times the control mean + 3 SD) were more than 8 years of age at diagnosis (mean age 12.4 years compared with 7.1 years in children with moderate or negative AAb levels; p = 0.003). The results suggest that the outcome for adolescents with high platelet-associated AAb levels may be similar to that of adults, whereas younger children may have a greater chance of spontaneous remission. The children with chronic TP in the past and elevated platelet-associated AAb levels may have a \"compensated\" TP and therefore may be at risk for relapses. Future studies aimed at serial AAb determination throughout the patients' courses may further define TP subgroups.\r"

Group 1 patients (n = 71) followed between 1960 and 1976 with a low-transfusion regimen (pretransfusion hemoglobin level 7 to 8 gm/dl) and no chelation had an estimated median age of survival of 17.4 years, whereas it was 31.0 years for group 2 subjects (n = 80), who began hypertransfusion between 1976 and 1978 (pretransfusion hemoglobin level 10.5 to 11.5 gm/dl) and chelation with deferoxamine (20 to 60 mg/kg per day) (p less than 0.0001). For 70 patients who were treated with hypertransfusion and deferoxamine, we had data to calculate the ratio of total milligrams of transfusional iron to cumulative grams of deferoxamine. The 24 patients who died had a total iron burden of greater than 1.05 gm/kg; the ratio for them exceeded 31. These patients were characterized by poor compliance with chelation or by late start of therapy, with inability to receive enough deferoxamine before death. Death was preceded by arrhythmia requiring therapy in all but one, and by cardiac failure in all. Of 41 similarly iron-loaded survivors, 33 had a ratio of less than 31; only three had an arrhythmia, and five had cardiac failure. We conclude that treatment with deferoxamine, when used in amounts proportional to iron burden, delayed cardiac complications and improved longevity.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of human surfactant given intratracheally at birth (prophylactic) versus rescue administration after the onset of severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) was conducted among preterm infants born at 24 to 29 weeks of gestation. Singleton fetuses were randomly assigned to receive (1) placebo (air), (2) prophylactic surfactant treatment, or (3) rescue surfactant treatment; infants of multiple births received either (1) prophylactic or (2) rescue treatment. Of 282 potentially eligible fetuses, 246 infants received treatments at birth and 200 infants had RDS. Outcomes are presented both as an intention-to-treat analysis (including infants who met exclusion criteria at or after birth) and as a full treatment protocol analysis for those infants with RDS and likely to benefit from surfactant. Preterm infants (mean 1.0 kg birth weight, 27 to 28 weeks of gestational age) randomly assigned to receive prophylactic treatment received surfactant soon after birth; those assigned to receive rescue surfactant had instillation at a mean age of 220 minutes if the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio was less than or equal to 2.0 and no phosphatidylglycerol was detected in either amniotic fluid or initial airway aspirate, oxygen requirements were a fraction of inspired oxygen of greater than 0.5, and mean airway pressure was greater than or equal to 7 cm H2O from 2 to 12 hours after birth. Up to four treatment doses (or air) were permitted within 48 hours; approximately 60% of surfactant-treated infants required two or more doses. Surfactant-treated infants had significantly less pulmonary interstitial emphysema than placebo-treated infants (p = 0.02), but there were no other significant differences in mortality rates or morbidity. Indexes of oxygenation and ventilation were improved in surfactant recipients during the first 24 hours. An intention-to-treat analysis found no significant differences between infants given placebo and surfactant-treated infants or between prophylactic- and rescue-treated infants; an improved total mortality rate (p = 0.002) was found among surfactant-treated infants in Helsinki but not in San Diego. Among infants with RDS, the total mortality rate was significantly improved (p = 0.004) with surfactant treatment but not the proportion alive and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 28 days (p = 0.052), or the proportion alive and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 38 weeks of postconceptional age (p = 0.18) to adjust for differences in prematurity. Deaths caused by RDS or bronchopulmonary dysplasia were significantly reduced among surfactant recipients (p = 0.0001). Neither among singletons nor among multiple-birth infants was there a selective advantage to prophylactic versus rescue treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91178598\r", 
  ".W": "In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled rescue trial conducted at 21 American hospitals, two 5 ml/kg doses of a synthetic surfactant (Exosurf Neonatal) or air were administered to 419 infants weighing 700 to 1350 gm who had respiratory distress syndrome and an arterial/alveolar oxygen pressure ratio less than 0.22. The first dose was given between 2 and 24 hours of age; the second dose was given 12 hours later to those infants remaining on ventilatory support. Infants were stratified at entry by birth weight and gender. Among infants receiving synthetic surfactant, improvements in alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient, arterial/alveolar oxygen pressure ratio, and oxygen and ventilator needs through 7 days of age were apparent. Death from respiratory distress syndrome was reduced by two thirds (21 vs 7; p = 0.007), and the overall neonatal mortality rate was reduced by half (50 vs 23; p = 0.001). Although there was no significant reduction in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (39 vs 31; p = 0.107), the hypothesis that survival through 28 days without bronchopulmonary dysplasia would be enhanced by two rescue doses of synthetic surfactant was proved true (21% improvement, from 132 to 156 patients; p = 0.001). In addition, the incidence of pneumothorax was reduced by one third (62 vs 40; p = 0.022), and the incidence of pulmonary interstitial emphysema was reduced by half (102 vs 51; p = 0.001). The only side effect identified was an increase in the incidence of apnea (102 vs 134; p = 0.001). These findings indicate that rescue use of a synthetic surfactant can improve the morbidity and mortality rates for premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

During the initial weight loss we found no evidence of catabolism. Body solids (weight--TBW) remained unchanged, there was nitrogen retention, and energy intake was sufficient to meet energy expenditure by day 2. However, we found evidence of fluid loss: TBW (mean +/- SD, -95 +/- 99 ml), extracellular volume (-98 +/- 63 ml), and interstitial volume (-102 +/- 75 ml) decreased significantly, indicating negative fluid and sodium balances. Blood volume and plasma volume remained unchanged. With the regaining of birth weight there was no increase in body solids despite a high degree of nitrogen retention, but there was a positive fluid balance although no significant increase in any body fluid compartment was found. We conclude that the observed postnatal weight changes reflect changes in interstitial volume.\r"

  ".W": "Renal dysfunction has been recognized as an adverse effect of indomethacin treatment and is probably secondary to impairment of renal blood flow. We therefore evaluated renal artery blood flow velocity in 15 premature infants with a symptomatic ductus arteriosus before and during the first 12 hours after a single intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg of indomethacin. Renal artery blood flow velocity was measured serially by color-Doppler flow imaging and used as a qualitative measure of true renal blood flow. Indomethacin administration led to a sharp decrease in peak systolic flow velocity and temporal mean flow velocity of the renal artery. This effect was maximal at 10 minutes after indomethacin dosing; the flow velocities showed a slow recovery, reaching baseline values again at 2 hours after indomethacin dosing. We conclude that indomethacin can affect renal blood supply in the premature infant for a period of at least 1 hour after indomethacin treatment.\r"

Twenty patients were treated with ceftriaxone and 20 with ampicillin. Both drugs were initially given intravenously for a period of 1 to 2 days and were continued intramuscularly, in the case of ceftriaxone, or orally, in the patients receiving ampicillin. All Shigella organisms isolated were susceptible to ceftriaxone; 28% were resistant to ampicillin. The diarrhea persisted for a mean (+/- SD) period of 2.5 +/- 1.0 days in the ceftriaxone-treated patients versus 6.8 +/- 6.3 days in the ampicillin-treated patients (p less than 0.005). At the end of the 5 days of therapy, stool cultures for Shigella organisms were negative in 12 (60%) of the 20 patients from the ampicillin group and in all the children (100%) from the ceftriaxone group (p less than 0.001). Bacteriologic relapses were observed in eight (40%) of the patients treated with ampicillin but in none of the children treated with ceftriaxone (p less than 0.001). In instances of clinical or bacteriologic failure in the ampicillin group, retreatment was instituted in most of the cases with ceftriaxone; persistent clearing of the Shigella organisms from the stool was finally achieved after a mean (+/- SD) period of 11.75 +/- 9.4 days after therapy was started, as compared with 1.85 +/- 0.6 days in the ceftriaxone-treated patients (p less than 0.001). We conclude that in children with severe shigellosis, treatment with ceftriaxone for 5 days is effective and better than use of ampicillin for clinical cure and eradication of the Shigella organisms from the stool.\r"

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mean +/- SEM) fell from 148 +/- 2/99 +/- 2 mm Hg to 128 +/- 4/77 +/- 3 mm Hg after 24 hours and to 121 +/- 2/75 +/- 2 mm Hg after 2 weeks. No further reductions in systolic or diastolic blood pressure were observed after continued therapy. Transient reflex tachycardia occurred during the first week of therapy. Other adverse effects were uncommon and included headaches, flushing, palpitations, and edema. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated at steady state after an oral dose of 0.56 +/- 0.04 mg/kg in 13 children. Although absolute oral bioavailability could not be determined, estimates of the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, the apparent peak serum concentration, and the apparent time at which the peak serum concentration occurred indicated that both the rate of absorption and oral bioavailability are variable. Coadministration of nitrendipine with food decreased the rate of absorption and may have reduced oral bioavailability. A relationship between age and the apparent plasma elimination half-life of nitrendipine was not observed. Nitrendipine, 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg per dose administered orally every 6 to 12 hours, appeared to be an effective and safe treatment for resistant hypertension in infants and children.\r"

In most infants and children with acute infectious diarrhea, treatment with antidiarrheal compounds is not indicated. Many of these compounds interfere with identification of enteropathogens in stool specimens, and the antimotility class has an overdose potential. Antimicrobial therapy is given to reduce symptoms and to prevent the spread of infection by decreasing fecal shedding of organisms. Although effective therapy is not available for patients with enteric viruses, Cryptosporidium, and Microsporidium, therapy is useful for children with amebiasis, antimicrobial-associated colitis, cholera, giardiasis, various forms of Escherichia coli diarrhea and Salmonella disease, isosporiasis, shigellosis, and strongyloidiasis. For several other conditions, antimicrobial therapy is of questionable benefit (infection with Campylobacter jejuni or Yersinia enterocolitica, intestinal salmonellosis and enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection). Compounds such as the fluoroquinolones, which are effective in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in adults, are not approved for use in children because of potential side effects. Many bacterial, viral, and parasitic organisms cause acute infectious diarrhea; appropriate antimicrobial therapy requires the accurate, rapid identification of the offending enteropathogen. In children with an underlying illness such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, manifestations may be prolonged, severe, and recurrent despite appropriate therapy.\r"

We have prepared national estimates of the annual number of cases of diarrhea in children less than 5 years of age and of the outcome, measured in terms of visits to a physician, hospitalizations, and deaths. The annual number of diarrheal episodes was estimated by reviewing longitudinal studies of childhood diarrhea conducted in the United States and extrapolating these data to the nation. Estimates of physician visits, hospitalizations, and deaths were prepared from a variety of national data sources. We estimate that 16.5 million children less than 5 years of age have between 21 and 37 million episodes of diarrhea annually. Of these, 2.1 to 3.7 million episodes lead to a physician visit, a total of 220,000 patients are hospitalized, and 325 to 425 children die. The major cost of diarrhea lies in the high numbers and cost of hospitalizations, because approximately 10.6% of hospitalizations in this age group are for diarrhea. Diarrheal deaths occur in relatively small numbers, are more common in the South and among black persons, are potentially avoidable, and could represent as much as 10% of the preventable postneonatal infant death in the United States. These estimates underscore the extensive burden of diarrheal illness in children in the United States and suggest that interventions to prevent disease or decrease its severity could be cost-effective.\r"

  ".W": "Infectious diarrhea, caused by a wide variety of viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens, is a common reason for morbidity and hospitalization for children in the United States. Overall, rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrheal disease in infants. Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter are the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens, and Giardia and Cryptosporidium are the parasites that most commonly produce acute infectious diarrhea. The mechanisms by which these enteropathogens cause diarrhea are highly variable, and include crypt cell proliferation, cellular invasion, elaboration of enterotoxins or cytotoxins, and enteroadhesion. In infants the incidence of diarrheal disease is higher and the severity of the illness is greater than in older children and adults. An increased rate of exposure to enteropathogens, as a result of fecal-oral contamination, may explain some of the increased incidence of diarrhea in infants. However, age-specific differences in host defense mechanisms may also account for the increased susceptibility to and severity of certain enteric infections in infants.\r"

Chronic osmotic diarrhea was induced in juvenile rats by supplying the cathartic agents, magnesium citrate and phenolphthalein, in their drinking water for 1 week. The experimental oral rehydration solutions were compared with standard oral rehydration solutions containing 20 gm/L or 30 gm/L of glucose and with each other to determine if there were significant differences in net water, sodium, or potassium absorption. An oral rehydration solution containing 30 gm/L of rice syrup solids had a net water absorption rate significantly higher than that of the standard 20 gm/L glucose-based oral rehydration solution (2.1 +/- 0.62 versus 1.5 +/- 0.48 microliters/[min x cm], p less than 0.05). Casein hydrolysate did not significantly affect net water absorption. However, combinations of 30 gm/L rice syrup solids and 5 gm/L casein hydrolysate significantly increased (p less than 0.05) net sodium and potassium absorption compared with the 20 gm/L glucose-based oral rehydration solution but not versus rice syrup solids alone. Oral rehydration solutions containing 30 gm/L rice syrup solids plus 5 gm/L rice protein, and 30 gm/L rice syrup solids plus 5 gm/L casein hydrolysate, had net water absorption rates significantly higher than the rate of a 30 gm/L glucose-based oral rehydration solution (2.5 +/- 0.36 and 2.4 +/- 0.38, respectively, versus 0.87 +/- 0.40 microliters/[min x cm], p less than 0.05). Rice protein and casein hydrolysate, however, did not significantly affect net water, sodium, or potassium absorption when added to rice protein glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. An inverse correlation between osmolality and net water absorption was observed (r = -0.653, p less than 0.02). The data suggest that substitution of rice syrup solids for glucose in oral rehydration solutions will improve water absorption and that rice syrup solids in combination with protein hydrolysates may, in addition, promote better sodium and potassium uptake.\r"

Our studies suggest that defined short-chain glucose polymers (2 to 9 glucose units) are hydrolyzed and absorbed faster than isocaloric solutions of D-glucose in the small intestine of the rat. Glucose polymers, primarily from rice-based solutions, have been shown to be as effective as glucose-based solutions. They offer additional advantages in reducing the amount and duration of diarrhea with lesser volumes of solution, thereby reducing the costs of treatment. Rice-based solutions provide high caloric density and increase the absorption of sodium without an osmotic overload. The result is increased net absorption of glucose, sodium, and water. Glucose polymers from rice or other starches in oral rehydration solutions may be effective, inexpensive, easily used, and safe treatments for acute diarrhea.\r"

In clinical trials of children and adults with high-output diarrhea, such as in cases of cholera, the use of cereal-based oral rehydration solutions (ORS) compared with glucose-based ORS produced significant (20% to 53%) reductions in stool volumes. In one study the duration of diarrhea was shortened by 30%. In noncholera diarrhea in children, cereal-based ORS was as effective as glucose-based ORS. Although the amino acid transport systems were intact in patients with cholera, the addition of glycine to glucose-based or rice-based ORS did not reduce stool volume or duration of diarrhea. The exception was alanine, which reduced stool output and ORS requirements. More research is needed to determine the optimal mix of starch, amino acids, oligopeptides, and proteins that would utilize the absorptive active transport systems maximally to reduce fluid losses and duration of diarrhea.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty male infants less than 1 year of age with acute diarrhea and dehydration were randomly assigned to a study group and studied in blind fashion in a metabolic unit to assess the efficacy of the addition of 30 mmol/L alanine to the standard World Health Organization (WHO) oral rehydration solution (ORS). Patients were exclusively rehydrated with one of two types of ORS during the first 24 hours of treatment. On the second day, oral feedings were started with a lactose-free formula, and ORS was given to replace stool losses. Body weight, ORS, food intake, vomitus, stool, and urine output were recorded at 6-hour intervals. Blood was drawn at the time of admission, after rehydration, and at 24 and 48 hours of hospitalization to monitor blood gases and electrolytes. Rehydration was satisfactory in both groups of patients. ORS that contained alanine did not reduce the purging rates of the infants compared with those who received standard ORS. Clinically no adverse effect of the alanine-based ORS was observed during hospitalization. None of the patients had significant hypernatremia or hyponatremia, and serum amino acid levels were not altered. These data show that the addition of 30 mmol/L alanine to the standard WHO-ORS produces no further improvement in the outcome of the infants with acute diarrhea compared with those fed the standard WHO-ORS.\r"

Important methodologic issues relevant to these trials, such as the composition and masking of study diets, measurement of outcome variables, and assessment of nutritional status, are discussed. Available data suggest that feeding should be continued during diarrhea, although a small subgroup of patients receiving nonhuman milk exclusively may have an excess rate of complications. These children should be closely supervised or provided with alternative diets. By contrast, children receiving human milk, nonmilk formulas, and mixed diets are generally able to tolerate these foods and to benefit nutritionally from continued feeding.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine which infant formula among five would be the most efficacious for the refeeding of infants during an acute episode of diarrhea. Fifty male infants less than 12 months of age with severe diarrhea and at least 5% dehydration were admitted to a metabolic unit and studied in a prospective, single-blind protocol. Ten infants randomly received one of five types of formula: two-thirds diluted cow milk, cow milk formula (Nanon, Nestle, Inc., Sao Paulo, Brazil), Portagen, Pregestimil, or Prosobee (Mead Johnson & Co. Division, Evansville, Ind.). They continued to receive the same formula for 72 hours unless dehydration occurred. There were no associated infections, and they received no prior antibiotic treatment. Oral hydration together with intravenous fluid therapy was given to all patients during the initial treatment. During the first 72 hours of refeeding, patients fed Portagen excreted the least amount of stool and required reduced quantities of intravenous fluids or oral hydration. In contrast, patients fed diluted cow milk or any other formula had more severe diarrhea. Nine of the 10 patients fed Portagen completed the 72-hour treatment, whereas only 2 of 10 fed diluted cow milk tolerated it. Similarly, the cumulative proportions for high purging rate, dehydration, carbohydrate intolerance, and vomiting were more favorable for Portagen and least acceptable for diluted cow milk. No differences were found among the remaining three formulas tested. These data show that diluted cow milk is poorly tolerated by infants with severe diarrhea, whereas Portagen is more effective.\r"

It was confirmed that the frequency of infected CD4+ T cells varied from 0.01 to 0.0001.

The assay (HIV-2 CE) has a sensitivity of approximately 250 pg/ml of HIV-2/SIV antigen. The HIV-2 CE was 4-16 times more sensitive than the Abbott HIV-1 antigen assay for detection of HIV-2/SIV antigen in cell culture supernatant. The sensitivity for detection of HIV-2/SIV antigen in serum or plasma was 98.5% in the HIV-2 CE and 95.5% in the Abbott HIV-1 antigen assay. The specificity of the HIV-2 CE was 99.2% (one false positive among 119 negative sera) whereas the Abbott assay was 100% specific. The HIV-2 CE detected antigen in supernatants from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of macaque monkeys infected with HIV-2 or SIV about 1 week before a reverse transcriptase (RT) microassay was positive and remained positive for at least 1 week after the RT assay had become negative. Three cultures from persistently infected monkeys were positive only in the HIV-2 CE, reflecting a higher sensitivity compared to the RT microassay. Thus, the HIV-2 CE was more sensitive than the Abbott HIV-1 antigen assay for detection of HIV-2/SIV antigen in culture supernatants as well as in serum/plasma. Furthermore, the HIV-2 CE showed a higher sensitivity than the RT microassay for detection of HIV-2/SIV in cell culture supernatants.\r"

To study HTLV-I behaviour following HIV-1 infection, we superinfected cells from two HTLV-I transformed cell lines with HIV-1 (strain IIIB). Viral RNA analysis indicated that HTLV-I expression in the doubly infected cells was moderately enhanced. Moreover, CAT assays in HTLV-I transformed cells transiently transfected with HTLV-I LTR-CAT disclosed higher activity in the HIV-1 superinfected cultures. This enhancement was observed only after infection with active HIV-1 virus, but not following exposure to inactivated viral particles or transfection with HIV-1 tat gene.\r"

Of these apparent long-term survivors, 780 (95%) were reported from 14 states or from local areas where collaborating health departments conducted special follow-up investigations: 119 (15%) were found to be alive, 475 (61%) were dead, and 186 (24%) were lost to follow-up. Health departments obtained consent to collect additional clinical and laboratory information on 48 of the living patients. Six (13%) had no laboratory evidence specific for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (antibody, antigen, viral isolation, or polymerase chain reaction assay); 41 (85%) had a positive result on at least one test; and one was not tested. Of the 41 infected patients, 25 (61%) had Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and two (5%) had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia as the only AIDS-indicative disease; the remainder had multiple diseases. CD4+ cell counts were low (less than 30% of total T lymphocytes) by the time of enrollment in 34 (87%) of 39 patients tested. When enrolled survivors with KS were compared with KS patients who had died within 2 years after AIDS diagnosis, survivors were less likely to have had other diseases in addition to KS than were nonsurvivors (31% versus 51%). While overall mortality by 1987 for patients diagnosed in 1978-83 was high (92-96%), a small number have survived and were doing relatively well clinically, despite evidence of continued CD4+ cell depression.\r"

  ".W": "After mid-1987 fewer than the expected number of cases of AIDS were reported in the United States in some demographic and transmission groups but not in others. Gay men (regardless of intravenous drug use), adults with hemophilia, and transfusion recipients exhibited fewer cases than expected based on previously reliable models. These favorable trends could not be explained by assuming earlier cessation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Favorable AIDS incidence trends were not found in heterosexual intravenous drug users or in persons infected through heterosexual contact. White gay men from New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco experienced markedly favorable trends, whereas little changes was observed for nonwhite gay men from nonurban areas. AIDS incidence trends were quantitatively consistent with the fraction of AIDS-free persons with severe immunodeficiency who received zidovudine in three cohorts. Gay men in San Francisco used zidovudine more frequently than did adults with hemophilia, while little was used by intravenous drug users in New York City. Data describing the initial national distribution of zidovudine (March 31-September 18, 1987) indicated relatively high use by patients with severe immunodeficiency in those groups, such as urban white gay men, that subsequently experienced fewer cases of AIDS than expected. Available data suggest that zidovudine, perhaps in combination with other therapies, has been one factor contributing to favorable AIDS incidence trends in some groups. Broader application of therapy might further retard the incidence of AIDS, especially in intravenous drug users, persons infected through heterosexual contact, minorities, women, and persons diagnosed outside major metropolitan areas.\r"

  ".W": "In Italy, drug abusers are the major risk category for HIV infection, representing 67% of all the reported cases of AIDS. This can in part explain the higher incidence of the infection observed in Italian females (17.7%) in comparison with the data reported in Europe (11.5%) or in the U.S. (8.5%). Therefore, anti-HIV screening in newborns reflects the serologic pattern of the respective mothers and can provide a useful tool in evaluating the incidence of the infection in a relatively unselected population. Furthermore, the data collected can provide a good predictive parameter for the rate at which pediatric AIDS will develop. Blood samples were collected on filter paper for routine screenings from 39,102 consecutive newborns in 92 hospital nurseries, from eight different Italian regions, during the period June 1988-April 1989. Blood-saturated disks were screened for anti-HIV antibodies (HIV Ab) using an ELISA; positive results were confirmed using a Western blot. Among the 39,102 blood samples tested, 51 (0.00130, 95% confidence intervals, Poisson distribution of 0.00097-0.00171) were found to be positive for HIV Ab. The distribution pattern of the positive samples among the different regions correlates to the cumulative AIDS incidence rate, with a higher prevalence in urban and industrialized areas.\r"

Immunoblastic lymphomas that arise in immunosuppressed transplant patients have been described as both monoclonal and polyclonal, and occur in association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. To test whether polyclonal lymphoma occurred in patients with AIDS we studied tumors from multiple sites in three patients who died with widespread AIDS-associated large cell or large cell immunoblastic lymphoma. All biopsy specimens contained invasive lymphoma. Tumor cells were mature IgM-positive immunoblasts by immunohistochemical analysis, with the same B-cell phenotype observed in all tumor sites. Only a minority of sites from all patients analyzed were monoclonal as measured by immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, with one case having several foci of monoclonal disease with other histologically identical metastases showing no evidence of monoclonal proliferation. Similar to the transplant-associated polyclonal B-cell proliferations. EBV gene sequences were present in multiple sites from one autopsy. In the other two autopsies, polyclonal B-cell proliferations occurred in the absence of EBV involvement except at one site, where a minor clone of EBV-infected cells was found. In contrast to HIV-associated Burkitt's lymphoma, no c-myc rearrangements were found at any site. These studies describe the occurrence of polyclonal lymphoma in AIDS and suggest that EBV-negative polyclonal lymphoma may be a distinct disease entity unique to HIV-infected individuals.\r"

Anti-HBs was detected initially in 138 patients (65%). Sixteen patients (8%) were HBsAg positive at entry. Fourteen had chronic HBV infection of whom 12 initially were positive for HBeAg and HBV DNA; 11 remained positive during follow-up, whereas one seroconverted to anti-HBe and lost HBV DNA. Two patients with chronic HBV infection were initially negative for HBeAg and HBV DNA: one later had reactivated HBV replication and one cleared HBeAg following onset of hepatitis D infection. The last two HBsAg-positive patients had resolving acute HBV infection. Six of the 57 patients who initially were negative for HBV markers acquired HBV infection during follow-up. Four of these six patients developed chronic infection whereas two patients had acute subclinical resolving hepatitis. In addition, four patients became HBsAg positive with their last serum samples, possibly indicating reactivation of HBV infection following progressive immunological and clinical deterioration. None of the patients developed clinical symptoms that could be ascribed to HBV infection, and transaminase elevations were only sporadically recorded. It is concluded that acquisition of HBV infections is not infrequent in HIV-seropositive patients with immune deficiency. Furthermore, the course of both previously established chronic HBV infection and newly acquired HBV infection is modified in such patients, whereas reactivation of past HBV infection seems to be a rare event.\r"

A patient sex ratio of three men to one woman was found for both viruses. In addition, the immune status of nonsymptomatic HIV-1 and HIV-2 seropositive people was evaluated. The correlation between abnormalities of the immune system and clinical status was similar for the two infections. Clinical symptoms of both diseases were the same, but this cross-sectional study could not address the questions of differences between the two infections in latency and development of disease or specific manifestations of HIV-2 infection.

The present study represents a cross-sectional analysis of coded specimens from 153 homosexual men, of whom 74 were seronegative and 79 seropositive for HIV-1. Fewer circulating B lymphocytes (CD19+) were found in HIV-1-seropositive subjects relative to a seronegative reference group. HIV seropositivity was not associated with decreased numbers of CD8+ T cells or activated T cells, which suggests that the number of circulating B cells specifically decreased. In addition to CD19, B cells were measured by CD20 and CD21 in a subset of subjects, and decreases in circulating CD20+ and CD21+ B cells were also apparent in HIV-1-seropositive subjects. The decrease in B-cell numbers was present at the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection (asymptomatic, clinically silent) and became more pronounced at more advanced stages of HIV-1 infection. The absolute B-cell numbers correlated with absolute CD4+ cell numbers (r = 0.59, p less than 0.001). These data suggest that HIV-1 infection is associated with progressive, selective decreases in the numbers of circulating CD4+ T cells and B cells.\r"

The antibody specificity of only a small amount of the total CSF IgG in these patients is known, and is directed against a variety of HIV-1 antigens. The specificity of the remaining CSF IgG is unknown. We report the results of the first study of CSF aCL in an HIV-1-infected population. We measured aCL IgG and IgM in the CSF of 21 HIV-1-infected patients without nervous system symptoms or AIDS, and in four HIV-1-negative controls. Twelve HIV-1-infected patients had an abnormal serum aCL value and CSF immunologic abnormalities and 9 HIV-1-infected patients had either abnormal serum aCL or CSF immunologic abnormalities but not both, or were normal in both regards. There was no difference between any HIV-1-infected patient and controls for CSF aCL IgM. Nine of 12 patients with an abnormal serum aCL and CSF immunologic abnormalities had CSF aCL IgG values that were at least 5 SD above normal control values, whereas none of the remaining patients had abnormal CSF aCL IgG values. All patients with abnormal CSF aCL IgG values had an intact blood-brain barrier as evidenced by an albumin index of less than 9, and all had nonreactive CSF VDRL tests.

All patients had had a prior molar pregnancy evacuated and presented with a rise or plateau in their beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels. The ultrasonography was considered to be abnormal if the image demonstrated a focal area of altered echogenicity within the uterus or if Doppler scanning revealed a focal area of detectable intrauterine blood flow. The ultrasound findings were compared with the pathologic results from dilation and curettage specimens. Ten of the 17 patients had pathologically proven macroscopic tumor. Of those 10, 7 had an abnormal sonographic image (sensitivity, 70%), and 9 had an abnormal Doppler examination (sensitivity, 90%). In all 10 patients the image and/or Doppler examination was abnormal. Among four patients with microscopic disease, imaging was positive in one case, and the Doppler examination was positive in three. Imaging and Doppler ultrasonography are complementary modalities that can reliably detect persistent uterine GTT, and Doppler ultrasonography appears to be more sensitive than imaging in making this diagnosis.\r"

Only one pathologic feature, fibrinoid deposits, identified in sharp curettings was associated with the development of persistent GTT. While 12 (48%) of 25 patients who attained remission without chemotherapy had fibrinoid deposits, only 1 (12.5%) of 8 patients who developed persistent GTT had them (P less than .10).\r"

This technique allows a clear distinction to be made between diploid and triploid hydatidiform moles. Additional ploidy aberrations, such as tetraploidy and aneuploidy, have also been reported in flow cytometric studies of hydatidiform moles. Recent investigations have suggested that aneuploidy in complete hydatidiform moles is associated with a high risk of persistent gestational trophoblastic disease. In addition to DNA ploidy analysis, cell cycle activity may be calculated from analysis of the DNA histogram. No significant correlation between clinical course and cell cycle kinetics has been demonstrated to date. By providing valuable DNA ploidy data, flow cytometric studies of hydatidiform moles may be helpful in the identification of patients at high risk of postmolar trophoblastic sequelae.\r"

Abnormal uterine artery Doppler measurements in cases of IUGR diagnosed with a sonogram and umbilical artery Doppler scan were associated with chronic maternal hypertension. Those fetuses fared worse than those in which the uterine artery Doppler scans were normal. In contrast, small infants from pregnancies in which all three studies were normal performed well overall.

Previous studies suggested that amnioinfusion may improve the fetal metabolic state and reduce the incidence of cesarean delivery in selected patients. In this study the hypothesis was tested that intrapartum amnioinfusion will relieve cord compression in pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios and will result in a reduced incidence of fetal intolerance to labor as well as improved fetal acid-base status at delivery. Thirty-five patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomized to either the control (n = 16) or amnioinfusion treatment group (n = 19). Analysis of the data suggested that the two groups were similar for the perinatal parameters evaluated. No differences were observed in the umbilical artery blood gas analysis or incidence of cesarean section between the two groups. Intrapartum amnioinfusion does not appear to improve the perinatal outcome in pregnancies with oligohydramnios.\r"

Skin changes were monitored with transepidermal water loss (TEWL), capacitance (CAP) (as an indicator of stratum corneum hydration) and visual scoring (VS). In forearm skin, irritant dermatitis developed in most subjects, as indicated by a VS and TEWL increase, with the reaction in premenopausal women significantly more intense than in postmenopausal women. In vulvar skin, however, irritant reactions were not observed. CAP increased significantly in the forearm of premenopausal but not postmenopausal women, whereas it decreased significantly in postmenopausal vulvar skin. Thus, vulvar skin was less reactive to SLS at low concentrations than was forearm skin. However, SLS did affect vulvar skin stratum corneum hydration. The irritant response in the forearm decreased with age for all parameters studied, whereas in vulvar skin age-related differences in irritant reaction were limited to stratum corneum hydration.\r"
