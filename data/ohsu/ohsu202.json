Daily doses of theophylline were sufficient to keep serum levels between 55 and 110 mumol/L. The subjects were 26 patients with severe asthma whose symptoms were inadequately controlled by regular treatment with inhaled salbutamol. The severity of BHR improved within 3 wk in the group treated with BDP, whereas no change occurred in the group treated with theophylline. There were no significant changes in FEV1 in either group during the study. When BDP was changed to theophylline there was a deterioration in BHR. Aerosol steroids, rather than theophylline, are the treatment of choice when reduction in the severity of BHR is the aim of treatment in patients with severe asthma.\r"

The prevalence of active tuberculosis was 0.91%, which is 28 times the age-matched NYC rate. Screening only those persons with a positive PPD and a cough substantially increased the yield of active tuberculosis to 7.2%, or 225 times the NYC rate. The prevalence of a positive tuberculin skin test was 32.4%, or 1.5 times greater than the age-matched NYC rate. Treatment or prophylaxis for tuberculosis was required in 128 or 13.2% of the screened population. Seventy thousand NYC welfare clients are routinely evaluated for medical illness each year. This study predicts that in 1 yr this subpopulation could yield 239 clients with active tuberculosis and 3,181 requiring INH prophylaxis. Screening for tuberculosis in the alcoholic and drug abusing welfare clients is therefore urgently recommended.\r"

Blood lymphocytes, labeled in vitro with a fluorescent dye, were injected either intravenously or into the left heart. Comparable high numbers of lymphocytes were found in the lung after 30 min, demonstrating a specific homing of lymphocytes to the lung vascular bed. When the left lung was perfused with a cell-free medium for as long as 4 h in vitro, a continuous venous release of lymphocytes was found that resulted in about 1.5 x 10(9) lymphocytes and 5.7 x 10(6)/min leukocytes. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were labeled with 51Cr in vitro and injected intravenously. Fifteen minutes or 1 day later the lungs were perfused, and the release of cell-bound radioactivity was measured. The data indicate the existence of a large intravascular pulmonary lymphocyte pool. The sequestration of lymphocytes in the lung in many lymphocyte migration studies is not a removal of effete cells but a physiologic phenomenon.\r"

Analysis of the lavage fluids from high risk patients and patients with ARDS showed an 8- to 10-fold increase in the total number of cells, an increase in the percentage of neutrophils present (control subjects = 1 +/- 0.4%, high risk = 53 +/- 8%, ARDS = 70 +/- 7%), and a 10- to 40-fold increase in protein content. The adherence of normal neutrophils to plastic surfaces after pretreatment with either concentrated lavage fluid, ultrafiltrates of BALF, or plasma samples was determined to evaluate the neutrophil adherence-promoting activity of each. Lavage fluid from high risk patients and patients with ARDS promoted an approximate 3-fold increase in neutrophil adherence when compared with control lavage fluid. Neutrophil adhesion-promoting activity of the plasma and lavage filtrates (mw less than 500 daltons) was not significantly different from that of control subjects. The adherence-promoting activity found in ARDS lavage was stable at 56 degrees C for 30 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Diltiazem decreased systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures without changes in cardiac output and in filling pressures of the heart, and with a slowing of heart rate. Pulmonary vascular resistances decreased from 401 +/- 59 to 329 +/- 58 dyne.s.cm-5.m2 (mean +/- SEM), p less than 0.01. Arterial Po2 decreased from 87 +/- 10 to 80 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.02) without changes in arterial PCO2, mixed venous PO2, and O2 consumption. Lung compliance and airway resistances did not change. Diltiazem increased true shunt from 23 +/- 5 to 30 +/- 7% of total blood flow (p less than 0.02) without other modification in the pattern of VA/Q distribution as measured by the multiple inert gas elimination technique. These results suggest that pulmonary vascular tone contributes to the maintenance of VA/Q matching in patients with ARDS.\r"

A preliminary study was conducted in asthmatics to assess whether the selected dose of atropine provided adequate muscarinic blockade. On different days we measured the provocation dose (in milligrams) of carbachol causing a 15% decrease in FEV1 (PD15FEV1) without and with atropine premedication (0.008 or 0.012 mg/kg subcutaneous atropine 30 or 90 min before carbachol challenge test). We found that 0.008 to 0.012 mg/kg subcutaneous atropine increased the PD15FEV1 carbachol by 6- to 10-fold, inducing a consistent and prolonged decrease in nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness to cholinergic agent. Then we examined 10 subjects with a history of sensitization to TDI in 2 sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we studied the subjects before and after exposure to TDI (0.04 ppm; 30 min) after no treatment. In the second set of experiments, carried out 1 to 2 wk later, we repeated the same procedure after treatment with atropine (0.008 to 0.012 mg/kg atropine sulfate administered subcutaneously 30 min before TDI challenge, and then at 90-min intervals after TDI exposure); all patients showed symptoms of atropine effect (dryness of mouth, cycloplegia, increased heart rate).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test the hypothesis that this is in part due to dysfunction of overtaxed inspiratory muscles, we studied 3 patients with BIDP before and after 2, 5, and 18 wk of daily intermittent external surface negative pressure ventilation (ENPV). The patients were evaluated using a zero to 10 functional score (FS) that graded dyspnea, orthopnea, capacity to perform activities of daily living, and ability to work. Pleural (Ppl), abdominal (Pab), and transdiaphragmatic (Pdi) pressures were used as an index of respiratory muscle function. All patients improved their functional score (FS increased 2, 6, and 6, respectively) and their pressure generating ability (Pplmax increased -18, -37, and -46 cm H2O, respectively). Forced vital capacity and functional residual capacity increased in the 2 patients ventilated for longer than 2 wk. These results indicate that ventilatory muscle dysfunction may result from chronic increased work of the inspiratory muscles and that it may improve after periods of intermittent ENPV. This may occur as early as 2 wk after initiation of therapy.\r"

Suspended road dust produced by studded tires increases from 30 micrograms/m3 during the summer season to levels as high as 400 micrograms/m3 during the snow season in the downtown areas of Sendai, Japan. Road dust retained in the lungs, containing 3% iron, was magnetized from the surface of the chest wall, and PMFS was measured. Three to 5 sequential PMFS measurements were made in each subject in March and October of 1984 and 1985, and in March 1986. The PMFS in control subjects in March 1984 was 37 +/- 14 pico-Tesla (mean +/- SD) and did not significantly differ from the PMFS in October 1984 or that in March 1985. In March 1984, the PMFS of the subjects in highly polluted areas was 95 +/- 100 pico-Tesla (mean +/- SD) and was significantly higher than that of control subjects (p less than 0.01) and subsequently decreased in March 1985 and in March 1986, corresponding to a decrease in suspended road dust brought about by a campaign to eliminate the use of studded tires. Our findings suggest that some road dust caused by studded tires is retained in the lungs.\r"

All resected specimens at primary surgery were reviewed by one gastrointestinal pathologist to evaluate, retrospectively, the influence of residual microscopic disease at resectional margins on recurrence rate. No statistically significant difference was reported between patients with involved margins and those without such findings as to recurrence rate, interval between primary surgery and reoperation at site of recurrent disease. This review does not provide evidence for adverse influence of residual microscopic disease at the margins of resection. Therefore, limited resection of macroscopically diseased bowel is recommended.

The mechanisms of injury varied from assaults with a blunt object to a low-velocity motor vehicle accident. Diagnosis was confirmed in all with computed tomography of the abdomen. Seven patients were successfully managed nonoperatively. The hospital course in these seven patients was uncomplicated with a mean hospital stay of 10 days. Three patients underwent splenectomy after failure of nonoperative management; two operations were performed semielectively and one as an emergent procedure. In the latter patient, the diagnosis of splenic rupture was made 7 days after the injury and was not suspected on initial presentation. The limited experience suggests that adults selected for nonoperative management should fulfill certain criteria that include 1) rapid hemodynamic stabilization after fluid resuscitation, 2) lack of other serious intra-abdominal injuries, 3) lack of extra-abdominal trauma that requires a prolonged general anesthetic or that results in an altered state of consciousness, and 4) progressive symptomatic improvement early during the hospitalization. Patients involved in high-speed motor vehicle accidents should not be considered as candidates because of the high prevalence of other serious injuries. From these guidelines, the results support the concept of nonoperative management of selected adults with splenic injury.\r"

To assess its safety, a consecutive series of 18 patients in whom PTD was performed prior to definitive operations for obstructive jaundice was reviewed. Internal biliary drainage was attempted in every instance. The biliary system was successfully cannulated in 100 per cent and the drainage catheter was passed into the duodenum in 16 patients (88%). Five patients (28%) had serious complications of PTD requiring emergency operations; three died. Complications after internal PTD were no rarer or less serious than those after transhepatic cholangiography without drainage.

  ".U": "88047713\r", 
  ".W": "Forty-six professors of surgery in answers to a questionnaire reported that 143 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome had been admitted to their hospitals within the last 2 years. The bed capacity of these hospitals totaled 27,019. In extrapolating these figures, it is seen that the capacity of the 46 institutions averaged 587 beds per hospital, and that an average 71.5 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome were admitted each year. In other words, a hospital with 587 beds might expect 1.55 yearly admissions of patients suffering from this disease. Two surgical methods have emerged as today's main treatment choices for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome that is unaccompanied by isolated gastrinoma. These are 1) preoperatively administered H2 blockers followed by less-than-total gastrectomy, truncal vagotomy, and postoperative H2-blocker therapy; and 2) preoperatively administered H2 blockers followed by highly selective vagotomy plus postoperative H2-blocker therapy. Only seven of 46 respondents still maintain that total gastrectomy should be carried out to cure the disease. All respondents advocate excision of an isolated gastrinoma as the treatment of choice if one is found at surgery.\r"

One was placed in the right renal vein, one in the right common iliac vein, and another in the right inferior vena cava in a patient with caval duplication and left ileofemoral thrombosis. A review of the postprocedure radiographs was performed. It was found that two of the three malpositioned filters were at an appropriate vertebral level, and, therefore, this single criteria was inadequate to judge proper filter positioning. A more reliable parameter was the maximal diameter of the open legs of the filter. The mean diameter of the legs in the correctly positioned filters was 29.9 mm compared with 19.0 mm for the malpositioned filters. The authors recommend that the diameter of the filter legs be measured on all postprocedure radiographs. If this diameter is not 30 +/- 4 mm (two standard deviations), then malposition of the filter should be suspected, regardless of the vertebral level at which the filter lies.\r"

During the last 17 months, a new antigen latex agglutination test for candidiasis has been evaluated. Results indicate that this new test allows early, accurate diagnosis of the disease. In 36 consecutive cases of culture-proven candidiasis in surgical patients, the test was found to be 94.4 per cent sensitive and 100 per cent specific. On the basis of these findings initiation of amphotericin B therapy in patients with a positive Candida antigen titer is recommended.\r"

Such stones are undoubtedly the result of chronic pancreatitis and stasis within the ductal system and may themselves serve to exacerbate ductal obstruction and recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. Endoscopic sphincterotomy has been used to relieve common duct obstruction secondary to biliary stones. This report suggests that sphincterotomy may also be used to approach selected patients who have pancreatic duct stones and recurrent pancreatitis. The technique involves a preliminary ERCP followed by standard endoscopic sphincterotomy with the papillatome positioned in the bile duct. A balloon catheter is then directed into the pancreatic duct orifice to extract ductal calculi. Although the main duct may be cleared, side branches are more difficult, and perhaps unnecessary, to clear. This method has provided relief of pain in a limited series of patients and may mark the beginning of a more aggressive approach to pancreatic endoscopy.\r"

Since its success has been controversial, a glycogen depletion histochemical technique was used to examine reinnervation. An ansa cervicalis NMP was implanted into the denervated PCA in nine cats. Eight months later, vocal cord activity was evaluated. The NMP nerve was stimulated extensively in seven cats (experimental group). Optical densities of NMP-supplied PCA muscle fibers from experimental and control groups were compared to detect differences in glycogen content. The results demonstrated quantitative evidence of reinnervation in two experimental animals. Electrical stimulation of the NMP produced abduction in one of these two animals, but was never observed during spontaneous respiration or airway occlusion. These observations indicate that reinnervation can occur but abduction requires electrical stimulation. The NMP technique may be more successful with an electrical pacer.\r"

In children, the stenosis is usually due to scar formation secondary to prolonged airway intubation, rather than to external trauma. The location and extent of the stenosis are highly variable; consequently, corrective measures need to be selected to suit the individual problem. In the present series of children, conservative treatment was adequate for lesser degrees of stenosis; those with more severe scarring required external laryngeal surgery. The preoperative evaluation and treatment plans are reviewed.\r"

These fractures were found to cause changes in glottal configuration sufficient to affect glottal resistance as well as amplitude and noise content of the voice signal produced by each larynx. Therefore, relatively minor injuries of the thyroid cartilage may cause potentially serious disorders of phonation.\r"

Just as the surgeon's judgment is crucial for a successful primary laryngotracheal reconstruction, so are his or her skill and judgment vitally important in managing the various problems that frequently are found following reconstructive surgery of the larynx and trachea. These problems, although seemingly minor, may prevent successful decannulation if not managed appropriately. This paper discusses the various problems that have been encountered while achieving decannulation following laryngotracheal reconstruction. An approach to such frustrating problems as suprastomal collapse, granulation tissue, and the inability to decannulate are presented.\r"

Patient records were reviewed retrospectively and the following data extracted: age, sex, laryngeal region and number of sites involved by tumor, T and N categories, and success or failure of radiotherapy. Tumor volume for each patient was calculated from pretreatment computed tomograms by summing the products of the cross-sectional tumor area on each CT cut and the interval in millimeters between sequential CT cuts. The mean tumor volume for patients failing radiotherapy was 21.8 cm3, and the mean volume for patients primarily controlled by radiotherapy was 8.86 cm3. Tumor volume significantly predicted disease-free interval (p = .045) and outcome with radiotherapy (p = .02). The study suggests that tumor volume is a significant factor in determining the outcome of primary radiotherapy in advanced laryngeal carcinoma.\r"

Therefore, in this investigation, listener judgments were obtained of 22 different sound sources with a view to incorporating the preferred speech sound in a new version of the device. Electroglottograms were used as sound sources in a speech synthesizer and sentences were produced with different voice qualities for judgmental tests. The results of the listening tests showed a distinct preference for waveforms corresponding to a long completely open phase, a very brief completely closed phase, and an abrupt closing gesture. The optimum acoustic characteristics for the device will be used by electrical engineers to manufacture a new version of the artificial larynx with an improved voice quality.\r"

Many have found, however, that it is not always possible to obtain consistently satisfactory video images of stroboscopic laryngoscopy. The problem is related to the low intensity of the xenon light source during stroboscopy. The authors have tried many different video cameras available, along with the Bruel & Kjaer Rhino-Larynx Stroboscope type 4914, and two types of endoscopes (flexible and rigid). The cameras included 1) single tube camera, 2) single chip metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) solid-state camera, 3) single chip charge-coupled devices (CCD) solid-state camera, 4) three-tube camera, and 5) three-chip CCD camera. Currently available video cameras and their adaptability for stroboscopic videolaryngoscopy are discussed.\r"

The vocal function varied greatly from individual to individual; however, the following tendencies were observed in many cases: 1) the glottis did not close completely; 2) supraglottic structures (false fold, arytenoid region, and epiglottis) were hyperfunctional and vibrated instead of or together with the unaffected vocal fold; 3) vibrations of the laryngeal structures were irregular; 4) maximum phonation time was short; 5) mean airflow rate was high; 6) fundamental frequency and intensity ranges of phonation were limited; 7) the voice was rough, breathy, and/or strained; and 8) cases with poor vocal function were most frequent in the skin flap group and least frequent in the lip mucosa group.\r"

Although the probability of cure for patients with stage I and II nasopharyngeal carcinoma is high, the probability of cure for patients with stage III and IV disease is poor because of a higher rate of local-regional and distant failure. Between February 1981 and August 1986, 24 patients with previously untreated, stage IV nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with two to four monthly courses of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy. A response to induction chemotherapy was recorded in 75% of patients (29% complete response and 46% partial) prior to radiotherapy. By actuarial estimate with a median follow-up of 42 months, the 2-year failure-free survival for all patients was 57%. In conclusion, induction chemotherapy has significant activity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The toxicity of this approach, as well as the influence of initial histopathology and response to chemotherapy on survival, will be discussed.\r"

The Roy and Sherrington hypothesis has been widely accepted to account for the phenomenon: increased neuronal metabolic activity will give rise to the accumulation of vasoactive catabolites, which decrease vascular resistance and thereby increase blood flow until normal homeostasis is reestablished. However, the hypothesis does not account for the disproportionate increase in flow that occurs in a number of circumstances. There are additional difficulties in reconciling more recent experimental data with the Roy and Sherrington hypothesis. In this review we direct attention toward the rich perivascular nerve supply to all parts of the cerebral circulation as possibly being an alternative control system allowing for rapid parallel changes in flow and neuronal activity.\r"

We examined the response of 22 patients to six different daily dosages of oral physostigmine, using selective reminding tests that were administered twice daily. Nine patients had a \"best\" dose/day (mode = 13 mg/day), which was used in a subsequent double-blind crossover study. The other 13 were given the highest tolerated dose. The selective reminding test and a full neuropsychological battery were given during the drug and placebo periods. As a group, the 22 patients improved significantly on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Digit Symbol subtest and a shape cancellation task (p less than 0.05). Nine patients showed improved performance on the selective reminding test during physostigmine treatment, and 9 showed no response; 4 patients performed better during placebo treatment. Dose finding did not help in predicting response in the crossover study; only 2 of the 9 who showed improvement had a best dose. Dementia severity did not predict crossover response. This suggests that: (1) physostigmine as administered had no pronounced effect on memory in Alzheimer's disease; (2) oral physostigmine produces no greater benefits on memory in mildly than in moderately demented patients; (3) response in a dose-finding phase does not predict response in double-blind crossover; and (4) Digit Symbol and cancellation tasks may be more sensitive than memory tests to the effects of oral physostigmine.\r"

Twenty-four hours after microembolization, the pathological alterations along the length of 55 myelinated fibers were reconstructed by computer imaging of 2,000 serial semi-thin epoxy sections of a tissue block that extended from just above and into an ischemic core. From proximal to distal, the typical sequence of pathological alterations was: normal----swollen dark axons + thin myelin or demyelination----attenuated axons----axon cytolysis (46 fibers) or normal axons (9 fibers). Because organelle accumulation and axonal swelling were the earliest and most proximal pathological lesions, we infer that regional hypoxia causes axonal stasis as a primary event. Demyelination was found in fibers showing swollen dark and attenuated axons. These findings suggest that axons are selectively vulnerable to acute ischemia and that, depending on severity, the fibers either undergo axonal degeneration or transitory structural alterations without axonal degeneration, the latter consisting of axonal changes and secondary demyelination.\r"

Seven patients, including 2 patients with neurofibromatosis, developed multiple primary malignant neoplasms. The median time to tumor progression after surgery was 31 weeks, with local recurrence representing the mode of treatment failure in nearly all patients. Notable clinical features included symptomatic leptomeningeal metastasis (13 patients) and intratumoral hemorrhage (9 patients). The estimated median survival time for all 50 patients was 98 weeks, with a 3-year survival rate of 32%. A trend toward longer survival was seen in patients 12 years of age or younger at diagnosis.

Mean levels of serotonin or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were elevated in most striatal subdivisions, whereas concentrations of dopamine or its metabolite homovanillic acid were slightly to markedly reduced. Dopamine and serotonin were at control levels in the nucleus accumbens and substantia nigra. Whereas the above-normal serotonin can most likely be accounted for by striatal atrophy, the reduced dopamine suggests either a marked down-regulation of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons or an actual reduction in the arborization of the striatal dopamine neurons. As experimental animal data suggest, the relative excess of striatal serotonin or one of its metabolites may facilitate the neurodegenerative process in Huntington's disease striatum.\r"

  ".W": "The penetration of roxithromycin (RU 28965), an ether oxime derivative of erythromycin, into the cells and fluid lining the epithelial surface of the lower respiratory tract was studied by performing fiber-optic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage on eight patients who had received roxithromycin at 300 mg perorally every 12 h for 5 days. The apparent volume of epithelial lining fluid recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage was determined by using urea as an endogenous marker. There was a significant relationship (r = 0.75; P less than 0.02) between roxithromycin levels in plasma and epithelial lining fluid, with a correlation whose slope suggested that the level of drug penetration into the lining fluid was 0.2. Concentrations of the antibiotic in cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (21 +/- 10 micrograms/ml) were 2 and 10 times higher than in plasma (11.4 +/- 5.7 micrograms/ml) and epithelial lining fluid (2.0 +/- 1.7 micrograms/ml), respectively. Thus, when administered perorally in humans, roxithromycin is markedly accumulated by resident alveolar macrophages in concentrations largely exceeding the MBCs of the drug for most facultative intracellular pathogens including Legionella pneumophila, despite low concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid.\r"

One such compound, desciclovir (DCV), is converted to acyclovir in vivo by xanthine oxidase. We gave each of 13 healthy volunteers 250 mg (about 3.25 mg/kg of body weight) of DCV orally thrice daily for 10 days, collected serial plasma and urine specimens, and measured DCV and ACV concentrations. The absorption of DCV was at least 75%, and almost two-thirds of the administered oral dose was recovered in the urine as ACV. Peak ACV levels in plasma were about 5 micrograms/ml and were reached in less than 1 h. The levels of ACV achieved in plasma were of the same magnitude as those reported for subjects given intravenous ACV at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg and approximately 10-fold higher than levels attained after administration of 200 mg of oral ACV every 4 h as measured in previous studies. The half-life of DCV was 0.85 +/- 0.16 h, compared with 2.6 +/- 0.5 h for ACV, indicating rapid conversion of DCV to ACV. There was no substantial increase in ACV levels in plasma on day 11 compared with day 2. No serious or consistent adverse effects were noted. In particular, the creatinine level in serum did not significantly rise in any subject and remained within the normal range in all.\r"

On the basis of MIC and MBC determinations, cefamandole was more active than cefuroxime against oxacillin-resistant S. epidermidis. Although temperature had minimal effect on the activity of either cefamandole or cefuroxime, NaCl significantly decreased the activity of cefuroxime but not of cefamandole. Neither cephalosporin consistently produced greater than or equal to 99.9% bactericidal activity within 24 h in timed killing-curve studies. No consistent relationship was observed between cefamandole or cefuroxime activity and oxacillin resistance phenotype.\r"

From the decoded results, intralaboratory variability among replicate determinations was found usually to fall within a fourfold range. Interlaboratory variation, however, was 16-fold or greater for all isolates, ranging to 50,000-fold differences for some isolates. Relative susceptibilities of isolates within each method could be determined in 11 of the 24 drug-method combinations and agreed with the reference rank order in all but one instance. Our findings underscore the lack of agreement among laboratories for the susceptibility testing of yeasts but indicate that such differences could likely be resolved by standardization without loss of clinical value.\r"

Terbinafine displays a primary fungicidal action against dermatophytes, other filamentous fungi, and S. schenckii. The type of action against yeasts is species dependent and can be primarily fungicidal (Candida parapsilosis) or fungistatic (Candida albicans). The in vitro activity of terbinafine is pH dependent and rises with increasing pH value.\r"

Cefotaxime-ciprofloxacin and clindamycin-ciprofloxacin were the most effective combinations, with 16% of all isolates and 44% of the Bacteroides fragilis group isolates responding synergistically to the former combination and 9% of all isolates and 37% of Peptostreptococcus isolates responding synergistically to the latter. Occasional synergy was seen with all other antibiotic combinations except for metronidazole-ciprofloxacin. Likewise, synergism was seen with all groups of anaerobes except for Fusobacterium species. Antagonistic interactions were observed only with a Peptostreptococcus intermedius strain tested against clindamycin-ciprofloxacin.

Patients were eligible if they received three or more days of therapy and at least two serial audiograms were available. The overall auditory toxicity rate was 9.6% (18 of 187). Auditory toxicity was detected in 4.4, 10.8, and 23.5% of patients given netilmicin, tobramycin, and amikacin, respectively (P = 0.05). In the univariate analysis, patients who developed auditory toxicity were significantly older (P = 0.01) and had a significantly higher (P = 0.04) percentage of trough levels of netilmicin or tobramycin above 2 mg/liter or amikacin above 5 mg/liter. In the final logistic regression model, only age was retained as independently influencing the development of auditory toxicity (P less than 0.00001). Conversely, factors that did not add significantly to the prediction of auditory toxicity were aminoglycoside serum levels, total aminoglycoside dose, duration of therapy, sex, peak temperature, presence of bacteremia, shock, liver cirrhosis, dehydration, previous otic pathology or renal failure, and development of renal toxicity. At least in certain populations, age is the most important predisposing factor for the development of auditory toxicity in patients receiving aminoglycosides.\r"

Similarly, sensitization of A. salmonicida strains by PMBN to the bactericidal action of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) serum complement was less pronounced than the similar effect of PMBN against other gram-negative bacteria in certain mammalian sera. The surface array protein (A layer), overlying the outer membrane of virulent A. salmonicida strains, did not appear to cause resistance to PMBN sensitization since an A-layer-deficient mutant showed similar responses to PMBN as its parent strain. Electron micrographs of PMBN-treated A. salmonicida cells revealed very little visible outer membrane disruption when compared with the extensive blebbing on the outer membrane surface caused by PMBN in certain enteric bacteria, including Escherichia coli K-37. However, small extracellular vesiclelike components, which may have been derived from the outer membrane, were numerous around PMBN-treated A. salmonicida cells. In this connection, PMBN caused disruption of the A layer in the form of bulges, breaks, and detached fragments which appeared to be associated with the accumulation of these vesicles underneath the A layer of wild-type A. salmonicida strains.\r"

Limitations in minoxidil solubility and percutaneous absorption have impaired the development of more effective topical therapy. Oral minoxidil (5 mg every 12 hours), a dose demonstrated to be relatively well tolerated if a 2-g sodium diet is strictly followed, was given to 65 patients with severe, treatment-resistant alopecia areata in an attempt to bypass the limitations of topical treatment and increase efficacy. Although hair regrowth progressed more rapidly and was more extensive with oral than topical 5% minoxidil, cosmetic response was seen only in 18% of the patients. Neither serum nor tissue levels of minoxidil correlated with response. These findings suggest that improved preparations of topical minoxidil, when used as a single therapeutic agent, are unlikely to be cosmetically effective in the majority of patients with severe alopecia areata.\r"

The mean specific activity for this free radical reducing enzyme in psoriatic vs uninvolved skin was 28.5 +/- 8.0 U vs 16.8 +/- 4.25 U. Because TR contains two reactive thiolate groups at its active site, this enzyme reacts with anthralin to form a covalent anthralin-TR complex causing irreversible enzyme deactivation. This mode of action for anthralin was confirmed by using pure TR from Escherichia coli. Keratinocyte cell cultures, grown from normal and psoriatic skin of one donor, revealed 24% and 42% inhibition of cell surface TR activity, respectively, in the presence of 2 X 10(-5)M anthralin. Time-dependent topical application of anthralin on guinea pig skin gave 70% inhibition of TR with concentrations of 0.25% to 1.0% after 24 hours in open and occlusive applications of the drug. Short contact with 1% anthralin showed 70% inhibition after 120 minutes.\r"

Cutaneous blood flow in the malar region did not change. Because vasomotor control of the finger skin is principally vasoconstrictor and that of the malar area vasodilator, these results suggest that mental activity unrelated to obvious stress may provoke changes in cutaneous blood flow in areas controlled by sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibers. Simultaneous changes in digital cutaneous blood flow, digital cutaneous pulse pressure, and heart rate indicate an autonomic-mediated effect.\r"

A 37-year-old man with congenital lymphatic dysplasia and a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the groin and foot was observed by us to have edema of all four extremities, numerous flat warts, and pityriasis versicolor-like papules over the trunk and arms. Condylomatous lesions were noted in the groin and a periungual verrucous nodule on the thumb. Biopsies showed the trunk and arm lesions to be verrucae and the thumb lesion to be Bowen's disease. Results of molecular hybridization studies from four lesions of the arms showed the presence of only HPV 3 DNA; HPV 16-related DNA was detected in the intraepidermal carcinoma on the thumb. Immunologic evaluation revealed anergy to routine skin testing, depressed mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte transformation, decreased B-lymphocyte count, and a severe reversal of the T-lymphocyte helper:suppressor ratio.\r"

Recent progress in understanding of the functional role of lipids in stratum corneum provides a new pathophysiologic basis for these earlier clinical observations. In stratum corneum, lipids are segregated within intercellular membranes, where they appear to regulate permeability barrier function and desquamation. Cholesterol is an important constituent of these membranes and may be essential to both of these functions. Perturbation of barrier function induces cholesterologenesis locally within the epidermis. Polar sterol metabolites, such as cholesterol sulfate, may also regulate epidermal sterologenesis under normal or pathologic circumstances. Cholesterol homeostasis may also modulate desquamation. For example, hairless mice fed azacosterol hydrochloride (20,25-diazacholesterol) develop a generalized scaling disorder without loss of barrier function. In these mice, total stratum corneum sterol content is markedly decreased, and topical or systemic repletion with cholesterol can correct the scaling abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Menkes' kinky-hair syndrome is an X-linked recessive neurodegenerative and connective-tissue disorder, with decreased serum copper and ceruloplasmin-copper oxidase concentrations and tissue-specific increases in copper content. Clinical manifestations can be related to relative copper deficiency and reduced activity of cuproenzymes in multiple organs. An animal model is provided by mice hemizygous for mutant alleles, such as the blotchy allele, at the X-linked mottled locus. This locus may be homologous in mouse and man. The basic defect is unknown but has been thought to reside in the regulation of the function or synthesis of metallothioneins. In the blotchy mouse and in cultured skin fibroblasts derived therefrom, we showed that the mutation specifically affects the metabolism of copper and not other trace metals. Excessive accumulation and abnormal (reduced) exit kinetics were demonstrated for copper but not for the related trace metals cadmium and zinc. While metallothionein-I messenger RNA (mRNA) concentrations were elevated in blotchy fibroblasts, the elevations in metallothionein-I mRNA in response to metallothionein inducers (cadmium, copper) were similar in blotchy and control cells. Further, metallothionein-I mRNA levels were indistinguishable in mutant and control fibroblasts containing equivalent intracellular copper concentrations. Finally, metallothionein-I mRNA content was not elevated in blotchy kidneys at early developmental stages, before storage of excessive copper. The aggregate data suggest that the basic defect in the blotchy mouse--and, by analogy, in Menkes' syndrome--does not reside in defective modulation of metallothionein function and does not cause abnormal regulation of metallothionein synthesis.\r"

Ten children coughed on 27 nights with a median of six bouts of coughing a night (range 0-272). The cough rate in the two hours after going to bed was significantly higher than the cough rate in the middle of the night (2-4 am or 4-6 am). Peak coughing times were 7-9 pm and 6-8 am. The room temperature was lowest between 5 and 7 am. There were no significant differences between cough rates during periods of rapid temperature change (more than 1 degree C an hour). The timing of nocturnal cough observed in this study differed from the known basophase of circadian cycles described for adults and children.\r"

Further pulses of endogenous cortisol production of 4000 nmol/l or more occurred in association with clinical complications such as intraventricular haemorrhage.

In particular, the children with diplegia showed a bimodal frequency distribution. Children of normal birth weight with diplegia had a higher prevalence of severe mental retardation than those of low birth weight. These differences may be due to survival bias and may not be of aetiological importance. Furthermore, the mothers of diplegic infants had a significantly higher proportion of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and low birthweight infants in their obstetric history. This suggests that prenatal factors predominate in the aetiology of diplegia.\r"

Many suffered severe illness in early childhood and nearly 30% died; many had feeding problems, severe fever, atopic disease, and recurrent respiratory infections. Some infants failed to thrive. We found no consistent common endocrine or immunological abnormality, although, most had abnormal immunoglobulin production. This may be related to the abnormal mucosa of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts which exacerbates the chronic obstructive airways disease found later in life in those who smoke. Mental handicap was not a feature, although convulsions sometimes occurred during fever. Early diagnosis is important to avoid attacks of severe fever and so that rational management may be planned for other problems that arise. Dental advice should be sought before school age and genetic counselling may also be required. Many female carriers may be recognised at clinical examination: their affected sons can then be diagnosed more readily.\r"

The mean (SD) absolute difference between SaO2P and SaO2 was 2.6% (2.4) after attempt to correct for the co-oximeter falsely measuring a proportion of fetal haemoglobin as carboxy haemoglobin. For 19 infants and children greater than or equal to 5 months old, who have very little fetal haemoglobin, the mean (SD) absolute difference of 27 comparisons was 1.8% (2.1). Comparison of SaO2P and PaO2 measurements in 46 instances when PaO2 was less than 6.67 kPa showed SaO2 to be less than 90% on 40 occasions. In 24 instances when PaO2 was greater than or equal to 13.3 kPa the SaO2P was greater than or equal to 98% on 22 occasions. In 23 infants undergoing neonatal intensive care, transcutaneous oxygen monitors were compared with arterial PO2 measurements in 60 instances. The mean (SD) absolute difference between PaO2 and transcutaneous oxygen measurements was 1.60 kPa (1.73). Ten of the 60 comparisons had differences greater than 2.67 kPa and three greater than 5.33 kPa (maximum 8.40 kPa). Pulse oximetry is a clinically useful technique for managing oxygenation but further studies are needed to confirm its safety in premature infants at risk of retinopathy of prematurity.\r"

  ".W": "It is claimed that suddenly squeezing a newborn baby's trunk with a pressure of 3-4 kPa produces a flow volume curve that can be used to measure the function of the small airways. If the squeeze is applied during expiration rather than at the end of inspiration, however, anomalous results may be obtained. One possible explanation is that the babies are limiting expiratory flow by making inspiratory efforts in response to the applied external pressure. The response of 10 healthy term neonates to forced expiration was studied by using an oesophageal balloon. The squeeze was provided by an inflatable jacket, and measurements of oesophageal pressure and jacket pressure were recorded, as well as flow and volume changes at the mouth. Two hundred and twenty one squeezes were performed at different points in the respiratory cycle. In 188 squeezes an inspiratory effort was evident before the oesophageal pressure reached a plateau (mean time to peak pressure = 155 ms). For the remaining squeezes a plateau pressure was associated with closure or narrowing of the upper airway in most of the babies. When the squeeze was applied at low lung volumes the inspiratory effort was significantly earlier and stronger than around end inspiration. Thus a baby makes a reflex inspiratory response to chest compression that may interfere with the measurement of airway function when this technique is used.\r"

In five instances specific complications occurred: a drop in haemoglobin concentration (three), transient hypotension (one), and haematoma at the biopsy site (one). The result of liver biopsy was diagnostic in 83% of cases, compatible with unspecified metabolic disease in 8%, and normal or not diagnostic in 9%. This study suggests that percutaneous liver biopsy can be performed with relative safety in small infants if coagulation is normal and there are no major contraindications, and the results yield important diagnostic information which cannot be obtained using less invasive procedures.\r"

The infants were well matched for weight, gestation, and postnatal age at the time of the study and were receiving full enteral feeds. They were investigated by balance techniques and plasma sampling on at least two occasions. Ten larger infants weighing 1330-1740 g and being fed on the same formula feed were also studied as an additional control group. Formula fed infants retained more nitrogen and gained weight faster. Plasma phosphorus concentrations were higher in the group fed on the formula feed, and alkaline phosphatase activity was lower. There were no significant differences in plasma concentrations of urea, electrolytes, or albumin or in acid base status. Taurine and arginine concentrations were higher in the group being breast fed, but there were no other significant differences in plasma amino acids, and no toxic concentrations occurred after either feed. The results of this study show that this formula (and presumably other feeds of similar composition) seem to be metabolically safe for the smallest infants.\r"

This followed a rise in the incidence of triplet and higher order multiple births which had started in the late 1970s. Analyses of data for births between 1978 and 1983 showed that while stillbirth, perinatal, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortalities among multiple births fell considerably, they remained consistently higher than those for singleton births. Differences in the distribution of birth weight do not wholly explain these differences. Analyses of certified causes of stillbirth and death are difficult to interpret because a considerable proportion were attributed to 'multiple pregnancy'.\r"

Groups that most closely matched the SIDS definition employed were reported to be healthier throughout life and freer from illness in the 48 hours before death. From the findings of this study the 'true' SIDS group did not appear as an 'at risk' population. The study group as a whole was not marked by social deprivation, poor mothering, or less privileged families. The importance of intensive investigation, including postmortem examination was emphasised, as misdiagnosis may give a 'falsely' inflated picture of the incidence of the syndrome and could cause unnecessary anxiety.\r"

At 1 year they had lost 41.4 +/- 1.8% of preoperative weight and the body mass index (BMI) decreased from 46.7 +/- 1.2 to 27.0 +/- 0.6 kg/m2. Despite rapid weight loss, malnutrition did not develop and their body composition became indistinguishable from that of normally nourished volunteers. Twenty-nine patients had a \"satisfactory\" result with more than 25% weight loss but were not within 30% of ideal. Their weight decreased by 34.8 +/- 1.0% as their BMI decreased from 55.4 +/- 1.2 to 36.0 +/- 0.8 kg/m2. Seven patients lost less than 25% of their preoperative weight (an \"unsatisfactory\" result). Malnutrition did not develop in any patient. In the authors' experience, in contrast to other weight reducing operations, vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) results in rapid weight loss without the concomitant development of malnutrition even in patients who return to normal weight.\r"

Chemotactic response to C5a and FMLP, phagocytosis of 14C labeled Staphylococcus aureus, and zymosan-induced superoxide release were evaluated 21 days after bile duct ligation (BDL), sham operation, or in normal controls. Serum total bilirubin level was elevated after BDL (p less than 0.01). Chemotactic ability was similar to each group. PMN phagocytic uptake of 14C labeled Staphylococcus aureus was depressed in BDL (p less than 0.05). BDL rats exhibited impaired PAM phagocytic indices and improved PMN superoxide release (p less than 0.03). PAM superoxide release was similar in each study group. Alterations in phagocytic function with cholestasis are important deficits in nonspecific cellular immunity that may contribute to the high incidence of infective complications associated with obstructive jaundice.\r"

The four currently advocated procedures, the straight endorectal anastomosis, the J pouch, the S pouch, and the lateral isoperistaltic ileal reservoir were evaluated in a puppy model with four animals in each experimental group. Measurement of rectal capacitance showed that all groups achieved 80-85% of control values at 6 months after surgery. Intestinal transit time decreased by one-half in all groups. Stool consistency, stool culture, water, and electrolyte absorption did not show any statistical superiority of one group over another. Stool frequency varied widely at 6 months; 10 stools per 8-hour period were counted in the lateral reservoir group versus 25 with the J pouches, and 16 with the straight and S groups. Stool frequency did not correlate with transit time, stool consistency, or rectal capacitance. Barium enemas showed that straight pullthroughs more closely resembled the measurements of the normal animal's endorectal canal. Based on these studies, there appears to be no advantage to adding a reservoir to the endorectal pullthrough.\r"

  ".U": "88048602\r", 
  ".W": "The first significant experience with the straight endorectal pullthrough for the management of ulcerative colitis was presented before the American Surgical Association in 1977 by Lester Martin. Since then the operation with or without modification has been used extensively. High stool frequencies in some series led to disenchantment with the straight anastomosis and to the development of various reservoir procedures to increase rectal capacity and thereby reduce frequency. As a result, no large series of straight pullthroughs is available for comparison with the reservoir modifications. Between September 1977 and September 1986, 72 children and adults, 61 with ulcerative colitis and 11 with familial polyposis, underwent endorectal pullthrough (ERPT) and straight ileoanal anastomosis under the overall direction of a single surgeon (AGC). Sixty patients have undergone ileostomy closure and form the basis of this study. Mean age at operation was 22.7 years (range 4-48 yr), and duration of active disease averaged 6 years. One-half of the patients underwent total abdominal colectomy with ERPT as a primary procedure. There were 11 cases of adhesive bowel obstruction following ERPT, and in six patients in the series permanent revision to a Brooke ileostomy was required. One patient died of hepatic failure in the late postoperative period. Follow-up has ranged from 3 months to 9 years. Mean stool frequency for the group as a whole at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months was 11.8, 11.2, 9.6, 9.0, and 8.3 per 24 hours, respectively. Daytime continence was achieved in all patients. Occasional nocturnal soiling occurred in 11.1% of patients at 1 year. Stool frequency and continence were also analyzed by age group above and below 18 years and above and below 30 years. There were no statistically significant differences between these groups. The authors conclude from this study that ERPT with straight ileoanal anastomosis remains an appropriate alternative for children and adults with ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis and compares favorably with the more complicated ERPT involving a reservoir.\r"

Twenty-nine patients underwent coloanal or colopouch-anal anastomosis for either carcinoma of the rectum not technically amenable to conventional low anterior resection, severe radiation injury, large benign lower third tumors, or complications of previous operations. The mean age of the patients was 61 years and 82% were men. A diverting colostomy was constructed in 55% of the patients. The mean (+/- SEM) length of follow-up was 20 +/- 3 months. There was no operative mortality. Transient urinary retention, however, occurred in 40%, anastomotic stricture in 28%, and anastomotic leakage in 3.4%. Four patients (14%) could not have intestinal continuity restored and therefore were considered failures. The stool frequency for all remaining patients (N = 25) was 3 +/- 1 per day (mean +/- SEM) and did not vary with age, sex, or indication for operation. Complete continence was achieved by 84% of patients, but no patient was incapacitated by poor bowel function. In patients in whom a conventional colorectostomy is impractical or unwise, coloanal anastomosis is a safe and efficacious alternative operation that preserves anal continence.\r"

Arterial or venous occlusion was carried out in 11 muscles and six bowel segments, with the remaining sham flaps serving as controls. Imaging was performed over 2 hours using a spin echo pulse sequence with T2 weighting. Arterial occlusions in muscles resulted in T2 values 15-30% higher than controls, while venous occlusion produced T2 values 55-75% higher than controls. Differences became significant (p less than 0.05) at 10 minutes after venous occlusion and at 35 minutes after arterial occlusion. Differences between occluded and control bowel segments, although demonstrating a similar trend, failed to reach statistical significance in this preliminary study. The authors conclude that magnetic resonance imaging may be a valuable method for early detection of venous and arterial occlusion in muscle flaps. Further study may also demonstrate this technique to be useful in the diagnosis of ischemic bowel.\r"

Conventional arteriotomy closure was performed during 483 operations, while patch angioplasty using a distal segment of saphenous vein was employed in 434. Preoperative risk factors, surgical management, and antiplatelet therapy were equivalent in the vein patch (VP) and nonpatch (NP) groups. Early results were evaluated by intravenous angiography (DSA) in 715 patients (89%), and 332 reconstructions (36%) have been reassessed by objective imaging during a mean follow-up interval of 21 months. Ischemic strokes occurred after 18 (1.9%) of the 917 procedures (0.7% VP, 3.1% NP; p = 0.0084), and symptomatic (N = 9) or unsuspected (N = 8) thrombosis of the internal carotid artery was confirmed by neck exploration or routine DSA after 1.9% of all operations (0.5% VP, 3.1% NP; p = 0.0027). Only ten patients (1.2%) have required reoperations for severe recurrent lesions, but the cumulative 3-year incidence of new defects (greater than or equal to 30% stenosis) documented by objective studies in the VP and NP groups was 9% and 31%, respectively (p = 0.0066). These results strongly suggest that VP angioplasty enhances the safety and durability of carotid endarterectomy.\r"

Anesthetized dogs (N = 15) were subjected to 4 hours of infrarenal aortic cross-clamping. In untreated control animals (N = 7), plasma levels of TxB2 rose from 654 +/- 74 pg/mL to 1238 +/- 585 pg/mL at 5 min (p less than 0.05), and to 3174 +/- 912 pg/mL 3 hours after declamping (p less than 0.05). Mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) rose 5 min after declamping from 13 +/- 2 mmHg to 21 +/- 2 mmHg (p less than 0.05). Cardiac Index (CI) declined during ischemia from 181 +/- 30 mL/kg.min to 128 +/- 16 mL/min.kg (p less than 0.05), and to 80 +/- 8 mL/min.kg after 4 hours of reperfusion (p less than 0.05). Platelet counts declined but platelets labeled with In 111 did not accumulate in the lungs, whereas quantitative counts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the lungs 4 hours after declamping yielded 213 +/- 33 PMN/25 high power fields (HPF) in dependent areas of the lung and 153 +/- 26 PMN/25 HPF in nondependent areas. The wet/dry weight ratio of the lungs was not elevated, although foci of proteinaceous exudate and PMNs in alveoli were noted. Another group of dogs (N = 8) were pretreated by random choice with the Tx synthase inhibitor OKY-046 2 mg/kg IV every 2 hours, which led to: lower TxB2 levels at baseline 95 +/- 35 pg/mL (p less than 0.05), 5 min after ischemia 140 +/- 93 pg/mL and after 3 hours of reperfusion 122 +/- 36 (p less than 0.05); lower MPAP, 16 +/- 2 mmHg (p less than 0.05); higher CI throughout (p less than 0.05); normal histology and reduced pulmonary PMN sequestration both in dependent 127 +/- 15 PMN/25 HPF and nondependent areas of the lungs 95 +/- 11 PMN/25 HPF (p less than 0.05). In animals undergoing sham ischemia (N = 3), levels of TxB2 and cardiopulmonary function remained unchanged from baseline. There were 150 PMN/25 HPF in dependent and 85 PMN/25 HPF in nondependent lung areas. The results indicate that ischemia-generated Tx mediates a rise in MPAP, a fall in CI, and PMN entrapment in the lungs.\r"

Thrombosis of the graft, which was invariably due to venous outflow obstruction, was the most common complication encountered. Revision of the venous anastomosis was not necessary in about one-third of the thrombosed grafts if a size 3 coronary dilator could be passed and the augmentation test was satisfactory. For revisions, creation of a new venous anastomosis using a jump graft was preferred over patch angioplasty or venous endarterectomy. Crossing the elbow for this purpose did not adversely affect graft patency. The incidence of aneurysm formation and infection was 16% and 35%, respectively. Infections involving the graft were managed by drainage, antibiotics, and bypass of the infected portion. Immediate bypass and delayed bypass were equally effective. About one-half of the infected grafts were salvaged by these techniques. The most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus. With a combination of the techniques outlined above, the service life of individual PTFE grafts can be extended. Two-year access patency in this series was 77%.\r"

  ".W": "Responding to a survey about their practice in 1985, 2,969 (70%) Board-certified thoracic surgeons provided data that were compared with data from manpower surveys in 1980 and 1976. (table; see text) Thoracic surgeons were most active between ages 35 and 54 years when they accomplished 61% of all general thoracic and 85% of cardiac operations. Surgeons older than 50 years performed significantly more general thoracic operations than younger surgeons, and the younger group performed significantly more cardiac operations than their older counterparts. Solo practice continued to decline. In smaller referral areas, the number of general thoracic procedures per surgeon increased, but the number of cardiac operations have decreased compared with 1980. Overall, general thoracic and cardiac operations increased, but peripheral vascular procedures and pacemaker insertions decreased in almost all nine census regions. Fewer general thoracic and cardiac operations were performed per thoracic surgeon in the western United States than in central and eastern regions. In response to questions about work load, 55% believed that their clinical activity was satisfactory, 42% operated too little, and 3% operated too much. The 363 non-Thoracic Board-certified surgeons who responded performed 14% of general thoracic and 8% of cardiac surgery in 1985. During the first half of the 1980s, our specialty certified an average of 134 thoracic surgeons annually, which is higher than the 120 surgeons per year estimated to meet the projected demand.\r"

As in non-small cell lung cancer, patients with Stage I disease were amenable to operation with 60% (3/5) free from disease between one and six years postoperatively. However, Stage II adenosquamous carcinoma (14 patients) exhibited highly aggressive behavior with rapid progression of disease (mean interval, 2.1 months). Despite combinations of surgery (6 patients), chemotherapy (6 patients, one response), and radiotherapy (10 patients, no response), median survival for patients with Stage III adenosquamous carcinoma was 5.0 months, worse than that for Stage III small cell cancer (9.6 months), adenocarcinoma (9.0 months), and squamous cancer (7.8 months).\r"

Twenty children (age, 1.16 +/- 0.3 years) underwent repair of congenital intracardiac malformations using aortic cross-clamping and cold potassium cardioplegia (ischemic time, 56.1 +/- 4.5 minutes). Metabolic protection was assessed by measuring the myocardial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content by microbioluminescence. Before and after ischemia 10-mg myocardial samples were obtained from the left ventricular apex using a Tru-cut biopsy needle. In 15 patients, postoperative ventricular function was measured by radionuclide ventriculography at 72 to 96 hours following operation. Five of 6 patients with a postischemic ATP level less than 40% of control (26.3 +/- 2.8) had a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) lower than 55% (50.3 +/- 2.3). Seven of 9 patients with an ATP level greater than 40% of the preischemic level (98.0 +/- 14.4) had a normal EF (61.8 +/- 2.9; p less than 0.04). Two other patients with postischemic ATP levels lower than 40% of control died of low cardiac output and had no postoperative ventricular function studies. Thus, of 7 patients with postischemic ATP levels lower than 40% of preischemic levels, 2 died and 5 had depressed left ventricular function. These data support the concept that low postischemic ATP levels correlate with death or poor postoperative ventricular function, and indicate that this variable will be useful to assess future improvements in myocardial protection during pediatric cardiac operations.\r"

The oxygen consumption/body surface area at an arterial lactate level of 20 mg/dl (VO2/BSA at La-20) was adopted as the blood lactate threshold. Age and pulmonary function parameters such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/body surface area (BSA), FEV1/forced vital capacity, diffusing capacity for the carbon monoxide/lung volume, and maximum ventilatory volume/BSA revealed significant differences between patients with postthoracotomy pulmonary complications and those without such complications. However, there was no difference in pulmonary function test results between the surviving and deceased patients. In contrast, although VO2/BSA at La-20 did not differ between the patients with and without pulmonary complications, it differed significantly between the surviving and deceased patients. We concluded that postthoracotomy pulmonary complications depended on the severity of preoperatively associated pulmonary function disorders and that the blood lactate threshold expressed by VO2/BSA at La-20 was an important indicator of the risk of hospital mortality.\r"

  ".W": "From June, 1983, to February, 1987, 91 patients with pulmonary outflow tract obstruction underwent a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt without an invasive study. The surgical indication was based on two-dimensional (2-D) and Doppler echocardiography only. In 82 patients (90.1%), 2-D and Doppler echocardiography allowed correct assessment of the intracardiac anatomy and of the morphology of the pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, and aortic arch. The aortic arch anatomy was misdiagnosed in 6 patients (6.6%) who underwent a modified instead of a classic Blalock-Taussig shunt. In 3 patients (3.3%), the indication for the systemic-pulmonary artery shunt was inappropriate; in 1, operative death resulted from the incomplete diagnosis. After the preselection of patients based on knowledge of the anatomical patterns, a systemic-pulmonary artery shunt may be performed without cardiac catheterization if these rules for definitive patient selection are followed: (1) accurate clinical assessment to identify the patients with restricted pulmonary blood flow; (2) precise intracardiac diagnosis by 2-D and Doppler echocardiography; and (3) definitive 2-D echocardiographic visualization of the pulmonary venous connection and the confluence of the pulmonary arteries.\r"

In 20 of the patients, MRI correctly diagnosed 20 of 21 aneurysms of the thoracic aorta (6 dissecting, 4 saccular, 10 fusiform), but 1 surgically proven fusiform aneurysm was categorized as an enlarged aortic dissection based on both MRI and angiographic findings. One dissection and 1 fusiform aneurysm were shown by MRI only. Coarctation of the aorta was identified in 4 patients. Ascending aortic enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy were identified by MRI in 4 patients with aortic stenosis. In 7 patients (25%), MRI provided additional important information not shown by angiography and in 1 patient, the MRI findings resulted in a change in the surgical approach. In 14 of 28 patients (50%), angiography was necessary for definitive preoperative evaluation of the aortic valve, the coronary arteries, or the brachiocephalic vessels. MRI was a useful noninvasive supplement to angiography for the preoperative assessment of thoracic aortic disease.\r"

The patients were randomized into two groups of 60 patients each. One group received doxycycline (deoxytetracycline) prophylaxis for five days, and the other received cefuroxime (a second-generation cephalosporin) for one day. The groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, common risk factors, diagnosis, and operative procedures. A reduction in the infection rate was noted in the cefuroxime group (10/60) compared with the doxycycline group (19/60), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.055). In major infections (empyema and pneumonia) there was no difference between the groups (4/60 in the cefuroxime group and 5/60 in the doxycycline group), but a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction was noted in minor infections (6/56 and 14/55, respectively) such as lower respiratory tract infections and prolonged fever. There were no wound infections in the two study groups. There were significantly (p less than 0.05) fewer postoperative fever reactions (axillary temperature greater than 37.5 degrees C) in the cefuroxime group (30/60) compared with the doxycycline group (44/60). Both antibiotics were effective in preventing wound infections, but cefuroxime may also be beneficial in preventing minor respiratory infections. The bactericidal effect of cefuroxime may explain this finding.\r"

There are, however, instances when a median sternotomy provides a more versatile approach and allows for equally acceptable repair. Twelve patients (age, 2 days to 16 years) with coarctation of the aorta serve to illustrate the value of the technique. All but 3 patients were under 3 years old. Five patients had repair of coarctation combined with repair of other congenital cardiac anomalies (atrial and ventricular septal defects, 2 patients; atrial septal defects, 2 patients; and valvular aortic stenosis, 1 patient). Six patients had complicated recurrences of previously repaired coarctations and 1 patient had a primary coarctation that involved the aortic arch. All repairs were accomplished through a median sternotomy with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and periods of (1) total circulatory arrest (6 patients); (2) reduced flow (4 patients); or (3) normal flow with multiple sites of arterial inflow (2 patients). All patients did well with no operative mortalities and no sequelae to date (8 weeks to 4 years). Examples of various techniques are provided to demonstrate the flexibility obtainable with this method. Median sternotomy can provide a viable approach to difficult problems involving coarctation of the aorta.\r"

The effects of different types of oxygenator and of blood suction on this natural humoral and cellular host defense mechanism were investigated in dogs undergoing CPB during sham open-heart operations. Airborne contamination of the wound area and the CPB circuit was performed by aerosolizing Staphylococcus aureus. A membrane oxygenator in the CPB circuit maintained a normal host defense mechanism. The use of cardiotomy suction during CPB with this type of oxygenator affected the host defense to some extent. The use of a bubble oxygenator in the CPB circuit together with cardiotomy suction seriously impaired the host defense. Postoperatively bacteremia developed in no dogs in the membrane oxygenator group, whereas 8 of 15 dogs in the bubble oxygenator group had a positive blood culture for the indicator microorganism. We conclude that the use of a membrane oxygenator is helpful to maintain the host defense. Attention has to be paid to reduce the deleterious effects of cardiotomy suction.\r"

Preoperative diagnosis was established by echocardiography in 2 infants. Anatomical surgical correction was undertaken in all 3 infants under cardiopulmonary bypass. There were no operative deaths. One child required reoperation at 15 months for anastomotic stenosis. All 3 children were well two to five years postoperatively with scintillographic evidence of normal ventilation and perfusion.

  ".W": "In recent years, the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt--a polytetrafluoroethylene graft from the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery--has been preferred over the standard shunt by some surgeons because (1) it requires less dissection and (2) length of native vessels is not critical. From January, 1979, to June, 1985, we operated on 51 infants less than 1 year of age, including 26 less than 1 week of age, to palliate severe complex cyanotic congenital cardiac malformations. Twenty-four modified Blalock-Taussig shunts and 29 standard Blalock-Taussig shunts were created. The groups were concurrent. We reviewed all available cineangiograms and measured branch pulmonary and subclavian arteries. Pulmonary artery index was not different preoperatively in patients given a modified versus a standard Blalock-Taussig shunt (144 +/- 118 and 118 +/- 59 mm2/m2, respectively), but it was greater postoperatively in patients with a modified shunt (431 +/- 188 and 189 +/- 106 mm2/m2) (p = 0.07). Distortion of the pulmonary artery occurred less often after a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (4/11) than a standard Blalock-Taussig shunt (6/8) (p = 0.06), though none of the distortions was severe. Early and late shunt failure occurred less often with a modified shunt (5/24) than with a standard shunt (15/29) (p less than 0.05). The modified Blalock-Taussig shunt had advantages over the standard Blalock-Taussig shunt in our series: pulmonary artery growth was greater, distortion of pulmonary arteries was less commonly seen, and shunt failure occurred less often. Thus, in infants, we believe the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt should be considered a reasonable alternative to the standard Blalock-Taussig shunt.\r"

The patients had high inflammatory activity as measured by erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP). Serum cholesterol and cholesterol levels in the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein fractions were reduced by 20% to 30% compared with healthy controls; and triglyceride levels in VLDL and high-density lipoprotein were reduced by 10% to 30%. There were significant correlations between the inflammatory activity and certain lipoprotein lipids, ie, between CRP and VLDL triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, and serum triglycerides. The fractional elimination rate (K2) measured by an intravenous fat tolerance test was 30% higher in the patients than in the controls despite reduced tissue lipoprotein lipase activities. There was correlation between CRP and the K2 value. These findings suggest that it is the degree of inflammatory activity that governs the altered lipoprotein metabolism in untreated active chronic inflammatory arthritides. The relationships between CRP and VLDL and between CRP and K2 suggest that the VLDL particles may be altered by inflammatory process, and that the increased elimination may take place through the \"scavenger pathway.\"\r"

Before treatment the lipoprotein pattern was characterized by low cholesterol concentrations in all lipoprotein fractions and low triglyceride concentrations in the very-low-density lipoprotein fraction as well as in the high-density lipoprotein fraction. During treatment with prednisolone combined with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide (n = 10), a reduction of the disease activity was achieved and the lipoprotein pattern was normalized; similar results were noted in a small group of patients (n = 4) treated with prednisolone alone while nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy (n = 9) neither significantly affected the lipoprotein pattern nor the inflammatory activity measured by the acute-phase reactants. The long-term treatment with penicillamine (n = 4) and chloroquine (n = 6) induced both a clinical remission of the disease and a reduction of the inflammatory activity. The lipoprotein concentrations started to reverse to the normal values during penicillamine treatment. In contrast, in the chloroquine-treated group the alterations in lipoprotein lipid concentrations were further pronounced, ie, the cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in serum and the very-low-density lipoprotein fraction decreased.\r"

Three years after the prospective evaluation, 54% of the patients had died. Only four factors, all psychosocial, were prognostically important. The patients who survived rated higher on the Karnofsky scale (85 vs 78 points), gained less weight between dialyses (1.5 vs 1.9 kg), more often underwent home dialysis (44% vs 21%), and less often wished for transplantation (28% vs 57%). In stepwise and multiple regression analysis, home dialysis and Karnofsky scale resulted in best fit. No somatic variable predicted outcome. Thirty-one patients were reinterviewed three years later. At that time, more patients were depressed and had a lower income, fewer wanted a transplant, and five had lost their living companion. There was a decrease in the number of patients who cooked their own meals, spent time outdoors, went to church, or had hobbies. Activity on the Karnofsky scale decreased from 87 to 84 points. The home dialysis patients' perceived health decreased from 3.9 to 3.4 points. Our study shows that psychosocial, but not somatic variables, are prognostically important in survival of older patients undergoing dialysis, and there is a measurable decline in these variables during a three-year follow-up period.\r"

More than half of all long-term dialysis patients received at least one transfusion annually, and the average transfused patient received 10 U of blood. A review of data on 318 dialysis patients over one year showed there is a sizable group (15.0%) who require greater than ten transfusions of blood. This group of intensely transfused dialysis (ITD) patients account for a disproportionate 67% of all units transfused. The majority of these patients (73%) were women, which may have been related to the relatively small proportion (12.5%) of women undergoing dialysis who were treated with synthetic androgens. These ITD patients were older and underwent dialysis longer than others in the population studied. One year mortality in the ITD group was 27%; more than twice that of the entire group (12.8%). A retrospective examination of transfusion practice in the five years preceding the present study showed that the number of transfusion recipients was essentially a constant fraction of the dialysis population. However, there was a significant trend to less intense transfusion of each transfused patient. Most of the ITD group had significant iron overload, and attending physicians indicated that concern about transfusion related hemosiderosis outranked other reasons including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, that would account for the more conservative transfusion practice of recent years.\r"

All roentgenograms were interpreted by two of the investigators who were \"blinded\" to diagnoses. Comparisons of readings were made that assured interrater agreement. A group of patients who underwent cholecystectomy served as controls. Studied in a logistic regression analysis model, controlling for the effects of age, sex, and race, primary hyperparathyroidism was found to be significantly associated with vertebral fractures. Subgroup analyses performed on the patients with hyperparathyroidism failed to identify specific biochemical or clinical markers associated with fractures. Our results suggest that the bone loss of primary hyperparathyroidism is clinically significant, leading not only to decreased bone densities but also to an increased prevalence of fractures.\r"

Physicians perceive the medical history as having much higher value in diagnosis than either the physical examination or laboratory/radiography information (mean scores, 5.76, 2.41, and 2.49, respectively). The perceptions of the importance of the physician-patient relationship were significantly correlated with the diagnostic value of the history. There was also a strong relationship between the perceived value of the history and preferences for more skilled interviewing responses, as measured by the Helping Relationship Inventory. Contrary to expectations, the perceptions of residents toward the diagnostic value of the patient's history increased significantly over the course of training (5.00 to 6.00). We conclude that despite the increasing emphasis on diagnostic technology, internal medicine residents and faculty continue to view the patient's history as the preeminent source of diagnostic information. Physician attitudes toward the physician-patient relationship and toward the medical interview may contribute to the diagnostic value of the history.\r"

To determine their impact on the management of outpatients with lung disease, both tests were performed on 100 consecutive patients (40 men and 60 women; mean age, 52 +/- 15 years) who returned for reevaluation 16 +/- 9 weeks after their previous clinic visit. Patients with obstructive (n = 45), restrictive (n = 35), and mixed (n = 20) lung diseases were initially assessed by history and physical examination and classified clinically as improved, stable, or worse. A clinical management plan (CMP) was formulated based on this initial evaluation. Changes in the proposed CMP due to spirographic or roentgenographic results were then noted. None of the 19 patients who were clinically improved and only two (3%) of the 64 clinically stable patients had a change in CMP. In contrast, five (29%) of the 17 patients whose conditions deteriorated clinically had their proposed CMP modified after review of the spirograms and roentgenograms. Therapy was intensified in three of the seven patients whose CMPs were modified, while in the other four, treatment was withheld because results of both tests were unchanged. These results indicate that routine spirograms and chest films have little influence on the CMP of clinically stable patients. However, unexpected roentgenographic and spirometric findings frequently alter the management of the individual whose condition has clinically deteriorated.\r"

Detailed journals were designed for the study to assess the timing and symptoms of the panic attacks and the levels of activity. Systolic blood pressure increased by 27 +/- 9 mm Hg during the hour of the panic attack compared with the hour immediately prior to the episode of anxiety, while diastolic blood pressure increased by 5 +/- 2 mm Hg. The ambulatory heart rate increased by 14 +/- 6 beats per minute during the hour of panic attack vs the hour immediately prior to the attack. There was a strong relationship between the increase in heart rate and increase in systolic blood pressure. These data confirm that normotensive patients with panic disorder have episodically hypertensive blood pressure readings associated with an increase in heart rate; these hemodynamic alterations appear to be secondary to their panic attacks and not to increased physical activity. However, despite these episodic \"hypertensive\" periods, the mean ambulatory blood pressures remain within the normotensive range.\r"

Results indicate that a stable, reproducible assessment of clinical skills can be achieved in a one- to two-day test battery, depending on the specific skills measured. The resulting score profile provides faculty with important information about the clinical competence of students that is not readily available from other sources, thus improving the breadth and accuracy of student assessment. A long-term goal is that performance-based testing techniques will be incorporated into the licensure process to evaluate clinical skills and ensure the competence of graduating physicians.\r"

Of the patients who had not received a specific vaccine, about 60% indicated that they would take pneumococcal or influenza vaccine if it was offered while they were in the emergency room setting. Offering vaccine in an emergency room setting promises to complement other approaches to immunizing adults at high risk for complications of influenza and pneumococcal infections.\r"

The study group included 47 consecutive critically ill patients with LBBB in the medical intensive care and coronary care units, who underwent a total of 82 pulmonary artery catheterizations. Twenty-six patients had an acute myocardial infarction, 34 patients had severe congestive heart failure (Killip class III or class IV), and 15 patients died during their hospitalization. Thirty patients had an old LBBB (more than one month in age), nine patients had a new LBBB, and the age of the LBBB was indeterminate in eight patients. There were five episodes of CHB in the group of patients with old LBBB. However, none of these episodes were related to the pulmonary artery catheterization, since CHB occurred either prior to catheterization (one case) or from one to 16 days after the pulmonary artery catheter had been removed (four cases). There were no episodes of CHB related to the pulmonary artery catheterization procedure in the patients with either old LBBB or indeterminate-aged LBBB. There were two episodes of CHB in patients with new LBBB. In both patients, the CHB occurred one day after the pulmonary artery catheter had been inserted. In both patients, CHB developed after episodes of ventricular tachycardia that eventually resulted in their deaths. Although it is unlikely, we could not rule out the possibility that the CHB was related to the presence of the pulmonary artery catheter. We conclude that the incidence of CHB complicating pulmonary artery catheterization with balloon-tipped, flow-directed catheters in critically ill patients with old or indeterminate-aged LBBB is extremely low. Therefore, we do not recommend the routine placement of a temporary transvenous pacemaker in all patients with LBBB prior to pulmonary artery catheterization.\r"

False-normal 99mTc bone scans have been described recently in neonates with biopsy-proved osteomyelitis. This phenomenon seems to be extremely rare in adults. Two elderly patients with hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis had normal technetium Tc 99m diphosphonate bone scans when first evaluated. In both cases the bone scans became abnormal four to six weeks after onset of symptoms and two to four weeks after the initial normal results of the study. When suggested by the clinical picture, hematogenous osteomyelitis cannot be ruled out by a normal 99mTc bone scan at any age. Gallium scan, computed tomographic scan, or bone biopsy can be helpful in such cases.\r"

It may also provide clinicians with a clue as to the presence of a dysproteinemia.\r"

To investigate the potential reversibility of cognitive deficits and the role of state variables, eg, attention and motivation, three groups of patients with schizophrenia were administered the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test on six consecutive occasions. Two of the groups received incremental information on how to do the test, including explicit card-by-card instruction. The third group served as a control. Regardless of the degree of instruction, patients who could not do the test could not learn it. The deficit did not appear generalized, as patients were able to learn word lists on the Selective Reminding memory test and were not globally demented on the Mini-Mental State Examination. These data suggest that prefrontal-type cognitive deficits in schizophrenia may be more profound than is generally appreciated.\r"

Following mCPP, but not following placebo, patients with OCD experienced a transient but marked exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Moreover, compared with healthy controls, patients exhibited greater other behavioral (but not endocrinologic or thermal) changes after mCPP.

The increases in the prolactin level following intravenous infusion of tryptophan and in response to protirelin were also determined. In male subjects, the GH responses to tryptophan and apomorphine were markedly increased by dieting; while also significantly increased, the GH responses to clonidine were much less affected. Female subjects showed similar trends in the GH responses to tryptophan and clonidine. In male subjects, prolactin responses to tryptophan and protirelin were not increased by dieting. In females, the prolactin response to protirelin was similarly not increased, but the prolactin response to tryptophan was markedly enhanced. These results are relevant to the use of neuroendocrine tests in depression. In addition, they suggest different effects of weight loss on neurotransmitter function in men and women.\r"

In depressed patients who lost less than 10 lb, PRL responses were significantly reduced compared with controls. In contrast, the PRL responses of patients with weight loss exceeding 10 lb were significantly greater than those of either controls or the other depressed patients. Growth hormone responses to tryptophan were significantly decreased in patients who lost less than 10 lb. Prolactin, but not GH, responses correlated significantly with the postdexamethasone plasma cortisol concentration; however, an apparent relationship between GH and PRL responses and suicidal behavior was probably due to the common factor of weight loss. The results suggest that depressed patients have different types of abnormal 5-hydroxytryptamine-mediated neuroendocrine responses that correlate with the presence or absence of severe weight loss and cortisol hypersecretion. Further investigations are needed to establish if these abnormalities are central to the depressive disorder or have implications for treatment response.\r"

Using sleep deprivation, we studied the extent to which age- and psychopathology-related sleep \"decay\" is reversible in aged normal, depressed, and demented subjects. Depression or probable Alzheimer's dementia compromised the augmentation of sleep continuity and SWS seen in healthy elderly following sleep deprivation. Rapid eye movement (REM) latency decreased during recovery sleep in the controls but increased in both patient groups. Compared with demented patients, depressed elderly had greater severity of sleep continuity disturbance both before and after sleep deprivation, a more protracted course of recovery sleep, and increased slow-wave density in the second non-REM (NREM) sleep period (during recovery). The REM sleep time was diminished in dementia compared with depression both at baseline and during recovery sleep. These differential effects of age, health, and neuropsychiatric disease on recovery from sleep loss are relevant to recovery or reversal theories of sleep and have implications for daytime well-being in the elderly.\r"

The rate of neuropsychologic deficit rose from 27% in mild hypoxemia to 61% in severe hypoxemia. Various neuropsychologic abilities declined at different rates, suggesting differential vulnerability of neuropsychologic functions to progress of COPD. Multivariate analyses revealed a consistent significant relationship between degree of hypoxemia and neuropsychologic impairment, but the amount of shared variance was small (7%). Increasing age and lower education were also associated with impairment.\r"

On the other hand, dual reporting is not advisable, as it would clutter reports and increase the cost and complexity of SI conversion, without yielding benefits. Results should be converted to SI units at the instrument, not by the computer. The Greek mu (mu) may be represented as u. Conversion graphs can be printed on the unused reverse side of report forms. The most important factors in the success of conversion to SI reporting will be thorough education of those reading the reports, and coordination of the conversion process within each locality.\r"

We assess the usefulness of new parameters derived from these measurements, such as mean corpuscular volume and red blood cell distribution width, which characterize cell size, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and hemoglobin distribution width, which characterize cell hemoglobinization in evaluating normal and abnormal subjects. The value of these parameters in classifying anemias is assessed in our patient population that includes those with iron deficiency anemias and thalassemias, as well as other forms of anemia.\r"

Of these, all but three were detected using a combination of S-Plus V-generated flags and preset laboratory criteria. There were 16 cases with red blood cell morphologic abnormalities, eight of which were not associated with specimens referred for complete manual differential cell count. In none of these 11 unreferred cases was the undetected abnormality of clinical significance relative to the patient's upcoming surgery. The use of the S-Plus V three-part differential in this patient population can result in a significant cost savings without adversely affecting patient care.\r"

Data from 443 patients (including 325 men and 118 women) who had undergone coronary angioplasty were analyzed. Total men, total women, aspirin-treated men, and aspirin-treated women received separate statistical treatment. The only statistically significant difference in mean laboratory values between success (no recurrent stenosis) and recurrence groups was for serum cholesterol in aspirin-treated women, where the recurrence group showed a higher value than the success group. Multiple logistic regression showed a statistically significant association between elevated mean cholesterol and low mean hemoglobin concentration and recurrence in the female aspirin-treated group. Although only a small number of the laboratory test results fell outside normal laboratory reference ranges, we noted that for some tests, patients with extreme values predominantly developed recurrent stenosis while for certain other tests they were mainly successful. For example, seven of eight male diabetics with plasma glucose concentrations above 9.4 mmol/L (170 mg/dL) developed recurrence, while recurrent stenosis did not occur in any of six men with a bleeding time greater than twice normal. The results of these studies do not support the hypothesis that lipoprotein, coagulation, and platelet factors influence the development of recurrent stenosis in the majority of patients, although abnormalities in certain of these parameters may contribute to the process in specific cases.\r"

A distinctive feature of the intimal thickening at the site of the distal anastomosis is the presence of an organized thrombus. These data suggest that obstruction of the distal anastomosis occurs due to the development of an atherosclerotic plaque complicated by an organized thrombus.\r"

However, the rest of the left coronary system, including the left anterior descending coronary artery and the left circumflex coronary artery, were intact in their normal positions. Arterial flow to the left coronary system was supplied by a dilated collateral vessel that originated from the right main coronary artery and coursed between the right ventricular infundibulum and the aorta. Our case suggests that atresia of the left coronary ostium and the left main coronary artery, often associated with death at an early age, may also be compatible with symptom-free longevity. Moreover, attention is focused on the nomenclature of single coronary anomalies.\r"

  ".W": "Hemiparetic gait is characterized by slow speed and poorly coordinated movements. Because the values of gait parameters vary with changes in speed, the slow speed that is typical of hemiparetic gait necessitates applying controls for the influence of speed when comparing hemiparetic and able-bodied persons. Gait kinetics and kinematics were measured in seven hemiparetic and seven able-bodied adults to compare their gait patterns at similar speeds and to assess the effectiveness of ankle-foot orthoses which were double-stopped in 5 degrees of dorsiflexion or 5 degrees of plantarflexion. Hemiparetic persons ambulating without the orthoses had a shorter step length, longer duration stance, and shorter duration swing than normal. They displayed greater than normal flexion of the affected hip during midstance, which, by putting the center of mass farther in front of the knee, may explain the increased knee extension moment due to vertical force. Affected hip adduction during single support was less in hemiparetic persons than in able-bodied persons, indicating a decreased lateral shift to the paretic side. During the swing phase, the affected limbs of hemiparetic persons were in less knee flexion and less dorsiflexion than normal, necessitating circumduction to achieve toe clearance. Ankle-foot orthoses increased walking speed to normalize heelstrike duration through use of an optimally adjusted plantarflexion stop. An improperly adjusted orthosis may produce an exaggerated knee flexion moment resulting in knee instability.\r"

Forty-two patients were treated with one of several \"cyclic\" antidepressant drugs, and 18 received no drug treatment. Objective ratings, based on current standard criteria for \"major depression\" (DSM-III), were used to establish degree of depression at initial evaluation and within six weeks after the start of treatment. Overall, improvement in depression was no greater in treated than in untreated patients. However, a subgroup (40%) of drug-treated patients was identified with a substantial (greater than or equal to 40%) improvement in depression ratings. Only three (17%) untreated patients showed a comparable improvement within a similar time period. Eighteen (43%) of the drug-treated patients experienced minor side effects (especially mild sedation), but only three (7%) experienced major side effects that required cessation of treatment. The degree of initial depression was not correlated with the degree of motor or functional disability among patients. These results suggest that antidepressants may constitute safe and effective treatment for some patients with poststroke depression, and further studies of the pathophysiology and treatment of this disorder are indicated.\r"

Four gait measures (speed, cadence, independence, and appearance) were all significantly correlated with one another. Stepwise multiple regressions indicated that motor control and balance were the best predictors of gait performance. The results provide guidance as to which predictor variables might be important in assessing stroke patients. The results also provide some guidance for identifying appropriate targets for treatment intervention with hemiparetic stroke patients.\r"

  ".W": "A tridimensional (3-D) x-ray method of evaluation of the shoulder was contrasted with six clinical and radiologic techniques used to evaluate shoulder subluxation, in 50 hemiplegic subjects. The 3-D evaluation is obtained through a mathematical computation associating two x-rays of the same shoulder, one taken at 0 degree (anteroposterior) and the other at a 45 degrees oblique view. A vector is thus obtained quantifying the separation from the apex of the humeral head to the inferior border of the glenoid fossa. The Y component (cephalocaudal) of this vector is used to represent the inferior displacement of the humeral head. The six other techniques of evaluation were: a) palpation, or the number of finger breadths inserted between the acromial process and the head of the humerus; b) anthropometry, or the distance between the acromial process and the lateral epicondyle of the humerus; c) templates, or the use of four schemas representing different degrees of separation of the humeral head from the glenoid fossa; d) a measure of the relation of the center of the humeral head to the center of the glenoid fossa; e) the vertical distance between the center of the humeral head and the center of the glenoid fossa; and f) the vertical distance between the apex of the humeral head and the inferior border of the glenoid fossa. Correlation coefficients contrasting the 3-D x-ray technique and the six other measures ranged from .738 to .995. The high level of precision and reliability of the 3-D measure indirectly validated the other measurement techniques.\r"

This technique gave the true vertical distance separating the apex of the humeral head and the inferior margin of the glenoid cavity. Both shoulders of each subject were evaluated and the difference used as a measure of subluxation. This measure was then compared to the orientation of the scapula relative to the vertical, to the abduction, and to the relative abduction of the arm. Relative abduction is defined as the angle between the humerus and the glenoid fossa. It has been suggested that these factors are associated with inferior subluxation in hemiplegia. Results of this study of 50 volunteer stroke patients indicated that the affected and nonaffected shoulders were different (subluxed) in terms of the vertical position of the humerus vis-a-vis the scapula. The orientation of the glenoid cavities was also different, the subluxed one facing less downward. The angle of abduction of the arm of the affected side was significantly greater than on the nonaffected side, but the relative abduction of the arm was on the same order of magnitude for both sides. There was no significant relationship between the orientation of the scapula and the severity of the subluxation. The abduction of the humerus was weakly (r = .24) related to the subluxation, which partly explained the weak association found between the relative abduction of the arm and the subluxation. It was concluded that the position of the scapula and the relative abduction of the arm cannot be considered important factors in the occurrence of inferior subluxation in hemiplegia.\r"

PC antigen concentration and its anticoagulant activity were measured in nine SCI men with ESRD maintained on hemodialysis and in a control group of ten normal able-bodied men. The results showed a significant increase in PC anticoagulant activity in the SCI group. Consequently, the ratio of the PC activity to its concentration, which is a measure of the functional integrity of PC molecule, was markedly depressed. These findings are indicative of the presence of inactive or abnormal PC in SCI-ESRD patients and may suggest its in vivo activation. The combination of impaired PC activity shown in this study, with previously demonstrated antithrombin III deficiency and other coagulation abnormalities, is suggestive of a hypercoagulable state.\r"

At this site the latency was, on the average, 1.4msec longer than at the midcalf location.

After ten years of follow-up, the local failure rate of patients without an EIC (193) was 3% compared with 35% for those with an EIC (107). Eight-year recurrence rates were 18% for clearly defined tumors and 71% for tumors in which the intraductal component was detectable only histologically.\r"

Although it has been established that enlarged, palpable lymph nodes contain metastases in less than half of the cases, no definitive data concerning the incidence of metastases in lymph nodes measuring 5 mm or less are available. We treated the surgical specimens of 52 consecutive patients who had colon cancer with a lymph node clearance technique at the Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo. We found 2699 lymph nodes in the 52 specimens, with a mean of 52 lymph nodes per specimen (range, five to 151). Sixty-four lymph nodes were found with metastases in 21 (40%) of the 52 patients. Fifty-nine of 64 of the lymph nodes were reexamined and remeasured. Thirty-nine lymph node metastases measured less than 5 mm, 13 were between 5 and 10 mm, and eight were larger than 10 mm. We concluded that lymph node metastases in colon cancer occur most frequently in lymph nodes measuring less than 5 mm (small lymph nodes). The use of lymph node clearing techniques in surgical specimens improves detection of small lymph node metastases and thereby diminishes understaging.\r"

These chromosomal data have been used to differentiate myxoid liposarcoma from other myxoid tumors exhibiting a non-characteristic histologic picture, as well as to ascertain the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma in undifferentiated soft-tissue sarcomas. The results to date indicate that identification of specific chromosomal changes in sarcomas may provide a new diagnostic criterion for these tumors and possibly improve prognostication with regard to survival and response to treatment.\r"

In 91 patients (70%), preoperative colonoscopy revealed no synchronous adenomatous polyps or cancer. Synchronous adenomatous polyps were found in 35 patients (27%), and three patients (2.3%) had a synchronous invasive cancer. Nineteen (54%) of the 35 patients with synchronous adenomatous polyps developed metachronous adenomatous polyps during the follow-up period compared with 24 (26%) of 91 patients without synchronous adenomatous polyps. The median interval to the development of metachronous adenomatous polyps was 19 months, and all of these polyps were 1 cm or less in size. Patients with synchronous adenomatous polyps less than 30 cm from the primary lesion (68%) developed metachronous polyps more often than did patients whose synchronous adenomatous polyps were more than 30 cm from the primary lesion (37%). Preoperative colonoscopy is important for determining synchronous pathology and identifying patients at risk for metachronous polyps.\r"

Low preoperative NK cytotoxicity was predictive of recurrence independent of age, sex, hematocrit, procedure, blood loss, duration of surgery, Dukes' stage, specimen length, tumor size, tumor differentiation, and post-operative therapy. Low levels of in vitro NK-cell cytotoxicity may identify a subgroup of patients at high risk for recurrence.\r"

Doses of intraportal epinephrine from 1 to 10 micrograms produced an immediate rise in capillary blood flow, reaching peak levels by 16 s. The increased flow lasted an average of 57 s. Because epinephrine selectively increased tumor blood flow, studies were performed to determine if enhancement of the chemotherapeutic effect of doxorubicin could be achieved. Forty-two rats with seven-day hepatic implants were treated sequentially with intraportal epinephrine (10 micrograms) and doxorubicin hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) or doxorubicin alone. After only two courses of chemotherapy, a significant difference in necrosis and cell viability was obtained in those animals treated with epinephrine intraportally prior to doxorubicin infusion. Enhancement of the tumoricidal effect of chemotherapy can be achieved by manipulating the blood flow to developing tumors pharmacologically.\r"

The study was unique in the sense that patients chose which system would be inserted, unless continuous infusion was anticipated. A total of 115 systems were inserted in 102 patients. Forty-four HCs were inserted in 34 patients (total system days, 8533 [mean, 194 days]); 71 ICVADs were inserted in 68 patients (total system days, 18,681 [mean, 263 days]). Complications required removal in 38.6% of HCs and 18.3% of ICVADs. Complication rates were one in 501 days in the HC group and one in 1450 days in the ICVAD group. Although 15 systems were removed for suspected infection, closer analysis revealed that bacteremia ultimately found to be unrelated to the catheter resulted in premature removal in many cases. The catheter tip was located high in the superior vena cava or in the subclavian vein in all systems removed due to thrombosis. Miscellaneous complications in HCs included dislodgment and catheter embolism. The increased longevity, lower complication rate, and decreased maintenance requirements in the use of ICVADs support their superiority over HCs in the treatment of patients with cancer.\r"

Twenty-one human colon cancers (four nonmetastasizing and 17 metastasizing tumors) collectively contained 24 spectral peaks. A peak at 6.7 to 6.87 parts per million cycles (ppm) was found in three nonmetastasizing tumors but only one metastasizing tumor; the mean area at this peak location was significantly higher in the nonmetastasizing tumors. Mean peak areas at 1.4 to 1.47 ppm, 2.0 to 2.33 ppm, and 8.3 to 8.6 ppm were significantly higher in metastasizing tumors; however, these peaks were observed with only marginally greater frequency in metastasizing vs nonmetastasizing tumors: seven of 17 vs zero of four, 11 of 17 vs one of four, and eight of 17 vs zero of four tumors, respectively. This study suggests that magnetic resonance spectral features may aid in staging human colon cancers and could be used to enhance magnetic resonance imaging of these lesions.\r"

The tumors were smaller than 5 cm in 13 patients, and in seven patients they were larger than 5 cm. A total resection was not feasible in any of the patients with lesions larger than 5 cm. Ten of the 11 patients treated with wide local resection, in whom the margins were clearly negative or close, remained free of disease for six to 16 years. Nine patients required additional treatment with radiotherapy (nine patients) and chemotherapy (five patients). Two died of local disease progression. In the remaining seven children, the disease was controlled. We describe our strategies for managing this disease in a pediatric population.\r"

Discontinuation of tamoxifen therapy resulted in reductions of DHEA, E1, and E2 levels by 44%, 49%, and 42%, respectively. Ablation or suppression reduced sex steroids to minimal levels and produced responses in all patients. Elevations of DHEA, E1, and E2 could be provoked by readministering tamoxifen to hypophysectomized and oophorectomized, but not adrenalectomized, patients, indicating that the adrenal gland is the source of these sex steroids. We conclude that tamoxifen stimulates adrenal production of DHEA, which is aromatized to E1 and E2. Buildup of E1 and E2 overwhelms the competitive binding of tamoxifen to the estrogen receptor, resulting in tumor progression.\r"

Patient response was good, with rapid pain relief in 75% and tumor control as detected by physical examination, computed tomographic scan, and decline in carcinoembryonic antigen levels. Pelvic drug exposure averaged 7.8 times that of systemic drug exposure. Of the 20 patients with recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma, one complete response (duration, eight months), seven partial responses (average duration, greater than or equal to 10 months), four patients with stable disease (average duration, greater than or equal to 12 months), and five with disease progression were observed. Three patients could not be evaluated due to late deaths as a consequence of their disease. There were two postoperative deaths in the remaining seven patients, one due to drug toxicity and one due to probable cardiac arrhythmia. Pelvic I-P has evolved with the avoidance of laparotomy and increased drug dose. We conclude that hyperthermic I-P for pelvic cancer is a safe, effective procedure and an excellent therapeutic option for patients with persistent pelvic cancer.\r"

A retrospective, computer-aided chart review identified 4185 patients with melanoma who had stage I disease clinically. During a follow-up period of one to 14 years, 35.9% suffered a recurrence. Melanoma of the trunk (37.8%) and head and neck area (46.1%) had an increased incidence of recurrent metastases compared with melanoma of the extremities (29.8%). Local regional metastases accounted for 62.5%, 77.3%, and 85.6% of the recurrences in the head and neck, trunk, and extremity primary sites, respectively, with 65% of the relapses occurring within the first three years. Actuarial five-year survival rates of patients who had recurrent disease were significantly decreased compared with those of patients who had no evidence of metastases during their clinical course. A multivariate analysis was performed to estimate the survival of patients after recurrence. One may use this mathematical model to predict the outcome of individual patients after recurrence and provide a more rationally based prognosis for them and their families.\r"

A definitive diagnosis of thymoma was not made until after thymectomy in 61 patients (35%); in patients not treated with thymectomy, 23% of associated tumors were diagnosed at autopsy. Patients with occult thymomas treated with the transcervical approach had a clinical course superior to those with tumors diagnosed prior to surgery and treated with the transsternal approach. Most of the advantage could be attributed to the association of occult thymomas with small tumor size and to the association of the latter with absence of invasiveness. Small tumor size was significantly associated with higher remission and lower mortality as shown in a proportional hazards analysis. Occult thymomas were accessible through the transcervical approach, with some operations necessitating a complementary mediastinotomy. Thymectomy, through the transcervical approach if technically feasible, is of benefit to all patients, has minimal morbidity, and should be performed early in the course of the disease as a diagnostic and therapeutic intervention since the risk of occult thymomas in patients with myasthenia gravis is high.\r"

In a historic prospective study, 202 patients with dementia were matched by age and sex with 202 nondemented controls attending the same geriatric assessment clinic and receiving comparable medical and psychiatric care. The three-year survival rate was 70% for patients with dementia and 84% for controls. Patients with multi-infarct dementia survived more poorly than patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The relative risk associated with dementia in the context of a multivariate analysis was 1.92 (95% confidence [1.25, 2.97]). We conclude that dementia carries a significantly increased risk of mortality but that the survival of patients with dementia may be better than previous reports would suggest.\r"

In addition to ocular motility problems, ataxia, dysmetria, and mild pyramidal signs, there were consistent behavioral observations and neuropsychological findings. All of the patients had initial deficits in arousal, and gradually improved to normal wakefulness. When awake, all of the patients had impaired attention, mental control, and slowed verbal and motor responsiveness. They were apathetic, poorly motivated, and affect was flat or occasionally labile. All of the patients had a memory disorder characterized by anterograde and retrograde loss. One patient had significant language impairment. These deficits persisted in all but one patient who had a predominantly mesencephalic lesion. We believe the cluster of findings in these patients constitutes a characteristic syndrome of dementia related to paramedian mesencephalic and diencephalic infarcts. This syndrome bears close resemblance to that associated with some subcortical degenerative disorders such as progressive supranuclear palsy. In cases of paramedian mesencephalic and diencephalic infarcts, however, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can delineate clinicoanatomic relationships that account for specific constituents of the syndrome.\r"

Acute confusional state was diagnosed on the basis of the results of the Mini-Mental State Examination, and AAD was distinguished from ACS by the characteristic behavioral abnormality. Of these patients, 25 presented with ACS, and six with AAD. Acute confusional state and AAD are common syndromes after infarction of the right middle cerebral artery, and infarction in this territory, therefore, has an important clinical implication as a cause of these syndromes. Acute confusional state is a disorder in which cognitive and integrative functions become defective, reflecting disturbance of global attention, and is closely correlated with other right hemispheric global and directed attentional disorders. It is linked to damage to the right frontostriatal region and is associated with lesion volume. In comparison, AAD is a disorder in which emotional and affective components are predominantly altered. None of the right hemispheric behavioral syndromes correlated with AAD. It may be related to damage to the right middle temporal gyrus.\r"

Despite minimal group differences in performance, the dyslexic group showed an increased hemispheric asymmetry (left greater than right) on a semantic classification task and a reduced anteroposterior difference on a line orientation task relative to controls. The exaggerated asymmetry suggests the possibility of less efficient information processing or inadequate bihemispheric integration. The reduced anteroposterior gradient may reflect a deficit in the ability of frontal systems to respond adequately to cognitive demands.\r"

Rimmed vacuoles were present in 3.4% of all fibers and 15- to 18-nm filaments were identified in the biopsy specimens of nine of 11 patients. A panel of monoclonal antibodies immunoreactive with lymphocytes and cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage suggested that the inflammatory reaction in IBM was similar to that in PM (but not dermatomyositis) and mediated by cellular immune responses. These studies confirm the clinical and histopathologic distinctions between IBM and chronic PM, and that differentiation between these disorders is often difficult.\r"

The combined findings of chronic partial denervation of the small hand muscles, decreased SAP amplitude from digit 5 and sometimes also from digit 3, and normal motor and sensory conduction velocity are compatible with a compression of the C-8 and T-1 roots or the lower trunk of the brachial plexus.\r"

While the most effective therapeutic range of anticoagulation is unclear, some investigators have found an increased risk of bleeding complications with more intense anticoagulation. Recent studies have suggested that lower levels of anticoagulation may be as efficacious as high levels but with a reduced incidence of bleeding complications. In order to better assess the anticoagulation parameters used by neurologists and house officers, we performed a questionnaire survey at six major medical centers. Responses were obtained from 30 attending neurologists and 52 house officers. Attending physicians and house officers selected mean partial thromboplastin times of 57.7 s and 63.3 s, respectively. The mean prothrombin time (PT) was 21.0 s for attending neurologists and 19.4 s for house officers. The average PT ratio was 1.82 for attending neurologists and 1.69 for house officers. Forty percent of attending neurologists and 17.7% of house officers specified PT ratios of 2.0 or greater. These results indicate that many physicians may be using warfarin in dosages above recommended guidelines.\r"

On a task requiring the inhibition of an inappropriate response, the patient with a left-sided lesion again performed normally. Conversely, the patient with a right-sided lesion had significant problems inhibiting the extremity contralateral to the lesion. We postulate that the medial frontal lobe may participate in response preparation and response inhibition by modulating the levels of excitability of the motor systems. Our findings also suggest that the right hemisphere may have a dominant role in mediating these processes.\r"

We have experienced three cases that included typical clinical, electrophysiologic, and neuropathologic manifestations of FAP, and yet no known family history of the disorder. The patients and members of their families were studied by radioimmunoassay for a variant transthyretin with a methionine-for-valine substitution at position 30. All three patients had the variant transthyretin in the serum, at concentrations of 54.5, 87.9, and 105.9 mg/L (5.45, 8.79, and 10.59 mg/dL). Although parents and siblings had neither neurologic nor electromyographic evidence of FAP, some of these family members had serum concentrations of variant transthyretin as high as those of the propositi. It was from these asymptomatic parents that the \"nonfamilial\" patients inherited the gene for FAP. Further study is needed to define the mechanisms retarding or preventing, as well as those promoting, the clinical development of FAP when the variant transthyretin is present in the serum at a high level.\r"

This article presents a review of recent studies concerned with the development of oligodendrocytes and suggests that the primary lesion in MS could be related to damage to oligodendroglial progenitor cells. Loss of the capacity to generate oligodendrocytes could alter the course of normal development such that insufficient cells are produced to support growth and replace cells lost through attrition, and as a result, regions of demyelination appear. The site and extent of the primary loss of oligodendroglial precursors would then predetermine the time of onset, site, and severity of the neurologic manifestations of MS. It is suggested that MS is a single, continuous process and that clinical, pathologic, and immunologic findings may be understood as the consequences of the acquired inability to generate sufficient oligodendrocytes to maintain myelin.\r"
