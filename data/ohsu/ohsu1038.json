  ".W": "A collection of coagulase-positive and -negative clinical strains of staphylococci, all of which gave a positive reaction with a mec-specific DNA probe, was analyzed for the mode of phenotypic expression of methicillin resistance by using population analysis on agar plates containing different concentrations of the antibiotic. Strains could be divided into four arbitrary expression classes. Cultures of class 4 strains were composed of uniformly and highly resistant bacteria (MIC greater than or equal to 800 micrograms/ml). In contrast, cultures of strains belonging to classes 1, 2, and 3 were heterogeneous: they were composed of two or more subpopulations of cells that differed from one another in MICs and frequencies. In cultures of strains belonging to expression class 1, most of the cells had methicillin MICs of 1.5 to 3 micrograms/ml, i.e., only two to three times higher than those for truly susceptible strains. In cultures of strains belonging to expression classes 2 and 3, the methicillin MICs for the majority of bacteria ranged from 6 to 12 and up to 50 to 200 micrograms/ml, respectively. While the definition of the expression classes was arbitrary, the modes of phenotypic expression were specific and reproducible: randomly picked colonies of a given strain produced identical population profiles. The strain-specific mode of expression was also retained after numerous single-colony picks and sequential passages in antibiotic-free medium. We suggest that these classes represent stages in an evolutionary sequence leading to progressively improved phenotypic expression of methicillin resistance in staphylococci.\r"

We examined the effect of oral ciprofloxacin on antipyrine disposition in 13 young (ages, 23 to 34 years) and 9 elderly (ages, 65 to 82 years) healthy volunteers. Ciprofloxacin decreased antipyrine oral clearance in young and elderly subjects (P less than 0.05), with the average decreases being similar in both groups (23.3% for the young subjects and 27.9% for the elderly subjects). Ciprofloxacin concentrations in serum were significantly higher (mean, 57%) in the elderly. The formation clearance of 4-hydroxyantipyrine and 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine was also significantly decreased in both groups of subjects; however, norantipyrine formation, accounting for 15 to 20% of antipyrine clearance, was reduced only in the elderly. These results suggest that elderly subjects are not more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of ciprofloxacin on antipyrine metabolism. However, careful clinical monitoring is necessary with all patients, irrespective of age, taking ciprofloxacin concomitantly with drugs primarily eliminated by the cytochrome P-450 system.\r"

Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., and Serratia marcescens) are inhibited at low concentrations. Cefquinome is also active against many strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Its in vitro activity against gram-negative anaerobes is very limited. The high in vitro activity of cefquinome is reflected by its high in vivo efficacy against experimental septicemia due to different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. We studied the pharmacokinetic properties of cefquinome in mice, dogs, pigs, and calves. After single parenteral administrations, cefquinome displayed high peak levels, declining with half-lives of about 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.3 h, respectively. The areas under the concentration-time curve determined for dogs and mice showed linear correlations to the given doses. In dogs the urinary recovery was more than 70% within 24 h of dosing.\r"

The MICs for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for S. agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis; 0.125 micrograms/ml for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, PD 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. In most instances, the in vitro potency of PD 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.\r"

Up to 10(5) U of interferon per ml was detected in mouse sera 1 to 4 h following oral (200-mg/kg of body weight) and intraperitoneal (50-mg/kg) doses of the compound. 7-Deazaguanosine also caused significant activation of natural killer and phagocytic cells but did not augment T- and B-cell blastogenesis. Intraperitoneal treatments of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day administered 24 and 18 h before virus inoculation were highly protective in mice inoculated with lethal doses of Semliki Forest or San Angelo viruses. Less but still significant survivor increases were evident in treated mice infected with banzi or encephalomyocarditis viruses. In most cases, the degree of antiviral activity was similar to that exhibited by the biological response modifier 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine. 7-Thia-8-oxoguanosine was more potent than 7-deazaguanosine against encephalomyocarditis virus in mice, however. Oral efficacy was achieved with 7-deazaguanosine treatments of greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg against all virus infections, whereas 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine is reported to be devoid of oral activity in rodents. Thus, 7-deazaguanosine represents the first reported orally active nucleoside biological response modifier exhibiting broad-spectrum antiviral activity against particular types of RNA viruses.\r"

Furazolidone exhibited only slight activity as a prophylactic agent but was moderately effective in the therapy of pneumocystosis. The median histologic score and organism count fell from 4+ and 10(8) to 10(9) cysts per lung, respectively, in the controls to 1+ to 2+ and 10(7) to 10(8) cysts per lung, respectively, in the furazolidone-treated groups. However, these results were not as good as those obtained with the standard drug, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (0+, 10(6) to 10(7) cysts per lung). Nitrofurantoin showed little anti-P. carinii activity despite different doses or drug preparations. The high doses of furazolidone used here and their toxic effects on the rats will probably discourage investigation of this drug in the treatment of pneumocystosis in humans. Nevertheless, since many nitrofurans have been synthesized, further exploration of this class of compounds might be helpful in developing new anti-P. carinii agents or in studying structure-activity relationships.\r"

  ".W": "The extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are believed to arise by mutations which alter the configuration around the active site of TEM- and SHV-type enzymes so as to increase their efficiency with otherwise nonhydrolyzable cephalosporins and monobactams. This hypothesis predicts that the genes for these new enzymes should be found on the same wide variety of plasmids that encode TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 beta-lactamases and that at least some of them should be mediated by transposons. Fifteen plasmids, each encoding an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, were examined. Unlike the average TEM plasmid, all were large, ranging in size from 80 to 300 kb. All determined resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents, ranging from 5 to 11, and some conferred resistance to heavy metals and UV radiation as well. The plasmids belonged to a limited number of incompatibility (Inc) groups, including IncC, IncFI, IncHI2, and IncM. Because most of the mutations giving rise to extended-spectrum activity are G.C----A.T transitions and some of the mutant genes have as many as four base substitutions, a plasmid-determined mutator gene was searched for, but no such property was found. Several techniques were used to detect transposition of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes, but a mobile genetic element could not be demonstrated even though eight of the plasmids hybridized with a DNA probe derived from the tnpR gene of Tn3. The genesis of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases may not be as simple as has been supposed.\r"

However, Chs2 is more resistant to these antibiotics than Chs1. When Co2+, the best stimulator of Chs2, was used in the assay for this enzyme, the differences in the Ki values for nikkomycins between the two isozymes reached 3 orders of magnitude. These results point to differences in the active sites of the two isozymes. Polyoxin D was much more effective than nikkomycin Z in inhibiting cell growth. This underlines the importance of the choice of enzyme and of assay conditions when cell wall-synthesizing enzymes are used in screens for possible antifungal agents.\r"

In quinolone-susceptible cells (top+ gyr+) as well as in topA mutants and in gyrB mutants, plasmid DNA was relaxed after the addition of ciprofloxacin. In cells partially resistant to quinolones, low ciprofloxacin levels led to an increase in negative superhelicity of plasmid DNA, whereas at higher ciprofloxacin concentrations, DNA became relaxed. Cells exhibiting partial resistance to quinolones carried either a gyrA mutation alone or a combination of gyrA and gyrB mutations. Moreover, they showed a reduction in gyrase activity, indicated by the supercoiling of a reporter plasmid. Therefore, we conclude that a low level of quinolone action and a DNA with a lower-than-normal level of superhelicity are the two essential conditions for obtaining a ciprofloxacin-promoted increase in plasmid DNA supercoiling. In contrast, deficiency in topoisomerase I is not required for this effect.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of four monoesters of sucrose with different acyl chain lengths (palmitate, C16; myristate, C14; laurate, C12; and caprate, C10) on the aggregation state of amphotericin B (AmB), its binding to cholesterol and ergosterol, its toxicity to cells, and its lethality to mice were determined. In solution, all four of these esters inhibited AmB binding to cholesterol more than to ergosterol; this effect correlated with the ester-induced shift from the mainly aggregated form of AmB to the mainly monomeric form. In experiments with cells, the esters inhibited the toxicity of AmB to mouse erythrocytes and cultured mouse fibroblast L-929 cells more than its toxicity to Candida albicans cells. When injected intravenously with AmB, these esters decreased AmB lethality to mice. In all of these assays, the ester with the shortest chain length (caprate) was much less potent than the other three esters. Our results indicate a correlation between in vitro and in vivo assays and suggest that the in vitro and in vivo selectivity of AmB may be enhanced by surface-active agents which modulate the aggregation state of AmB.\r"

No differences in rifampin agar dilution MICs were detected for the 23 isolates and parent strain that were tested. None of the 13 isolates from animals treated with rifampin alone had a high number of resistant organisms detected by using a rifampin gradient plate assay. Thirteen isolates plus the parent strain were tested by using a quantitative method of determining resistance frequency. Considerable heterogeneity among isolates was observed, but there was no evidence of increased resistance for any treatment group. The range of rifampin resistance frequencies was 10(-7) to 10(-8). No evidence for rifampin-induced resistance of L. pneumophila was found in this study.\r"

These results indicated that tetracycline enters cells through diffusion as a protonated form (TH2) and is accumulated as a membrane-impermeable magnesium-tetracycline chelate complex (THMg+). This noncarrier diffusion hypothesis was confirmed by the fact that tetracycline accumulated in protein-free liposomes through an artificially imposed pH difference.\r"

The time of initiation of study following burn injury was 7.0 +/- 1.4 days. Four patients at first dose and at steady state were studied. Aztreonam concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and a two-compartment model was used to fit the data. No significant differences in any pharmacokinetic parameters between first dose and steady state were observed. Volume of distribution of the central compartment after first dose (0.14 liters/kg) and volume of distribution at steady state (0.31 liters/kg) were approximately 30% higher than those reported for other patient populations. Total drug clearance and renal drug clearance when normalized to creatinine clearance (CLCR) were similar to those previously reported for other critically ill patients. CLCR was strongly correlated with renal drug clearance (r = 0.94) and total drug clearance (r = 0.95). The extent and degree of burn (percent second or third degree burn) were poorly correlated with all pharmacokinetic parameters with the exception of the volume of distribution at steady state, which was correlated with both total body surface area burn (r = 0.95) and percent second degree burn (r = 0.83). Aztreonam pharmacokinetics are altered as a result of thermal injury; however, CLCR can be used to assess the clearance of aztreonam in burn patients.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of five new beta-lactams to permeate the outer membrane of intact Enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamase-overproducing cells was measured by using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based technique that avoided certain possible artifacts of the traditional methods. Low concentrations of antibiotics were mixed with bacterial suspensions, and at different times, the cells were removed from the medium by filtration. Residual beta-lactam concentrations in the medium were then assessed by HPLC and UV detection. The assay was performed under conditions in which no beta-lactamase activity was detected in the filtrate and the number of viable cells remained constant during the experiment. Outer membrane permeability was assessed with the Zimmermann-Rosselet equation, in which outer membrane permeability was rate limiting for hydrolysis of the beta-lactam by periplasmic beta-lactamase. Thus, the rate of disappearance of beta-lactam was equal to the rate of outer membrane permeation. Preincubation of bacterial suspensions with 300 micrograms of cloxacillin per ml inhibited the hydrolysis of beta-lactams by intact cells, demonstrating that beta-lactam hydrolysis by periplasmic beta-lactamase was essential in order to allow measurement of outer membrane permeability by this method. Permeability coefficients (P) were calculated from the Zimmermann-Rosselet equation and were independent of the external concentration of antibiotic over a 100-fold concentration range. Cefepime and cefpirome exhibited rates of outer membrane permeation 5- to 20-fold higher than those of carumonam, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime. Thus, the presence of a positive charge in the 3-lateral chain increased the permeation ability of beta-lactam molecules considerably.\r"

  ".W": "The roles of outer membrane permeability, beta-lactamase stability, and inhibition of penicillin-binding proteins in the activity of new beta-lactams against Enterobacter cloacae were reappraised by using several methodological improvements. Outer membrane permeability in intact cells was determined by using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based technique that avoided certain possible artifacts of the traditional methods. Vmax values were calculated from the numbers of enzyme molecules produced per cell and from catalytic constant (Kcat) values, which were obtained with purified beta-lactamase. Minimal periplasmic antibiotic concentrations needed to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis were estimated from the Zimmermann-Rosselet equation. All the beta-lactams tested formed relatively stable complexes with purified beta-lactamase. The antibiotics that exhibited low affinity for beta-lactamase apparently needed higher periplasmic concentrations to inhibit cell wall synthesis, suggesting a possible correlation between the affinity of beta-lactamase and the affinity of penicillin-binding proteins for the new beta-lactams. By using these estimates of outer membrane permeability, beta-lactamase hydrolysis, and cell wall-inhibiting concentrations, MIC could be theoretically predicted to within 1 dilution for five beta-lactams in three isogenic E. cloacae strains with differences in antibiotic susceptibility due to different porin or beta-lactamase contents.\r"

A total of 54 patients were randomized, and 40 were evaluable. Of the 40, 9 had infection of indwelling vascular catheters. Four infections were due to Staphylococcus aureus, and five were due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. In concert with catheter removal, all patients were treated successfully, regardless of which drug they were taking. Of 31 patients without an indwelling catheter, 19 were infected with S. aureus, and 12 of the 19 had either endocarditis or mycotic aneurysm. Six of eight patients given teicoplanin failed treatment, as opposed to one of four patients given vancomycin (P = 0.14). Of greater concern, four of four patients with left-sided endocarditis or mycotic aneurysm failed to recover when given teicoplanin, as opposed to one of three patients given vancomycin (P = 0.07). Although not quite statistically significant, the unexpectedly high number of treatment failures with teicoplanin resulted in a decision to discontinue patient enrollment. It is suggested that future trials explore the efficacy of larger doses of teicoplanin.\r"

A marked synergy between penicillins or imipenem and glycopeptides against the glycopeptide-resistant strains but not against the glycopeptide-susceptible strains was observed by the double-disk agar diffusion assay. The synergy of combinations of amoxicillin, imipenem, penicillin G, or piperacillin with vancomycin or teicoplanin against resistant strains was confirmed by the checkerboard technique. The fractional inhibitory concentration indexes were generally below 0.25, except for one strain of E. faecium resistant to high levels of penicillin G. However, the combinations were not bactericidal as tested by time-killing experiments, and high concentrations (64 micrograms/ml) of amoxicillin, penicillin G, or piperacillin combined with 8 micrograms of vancomycin or teicoplanin per ml tended to be antagonistic. Addition of 4 micrograms of gentamicin per ml to these combinations enhanced their bactericidal effect, but they occasionally remained slightly less effective than beta-lactams associated with gentamicin. The combination of 10 micrograms of daptomycin per ml with gentamicin was bactericidal after 6 h against 11 glycopeptide-resistant strains.\r"

Extraction with 0.025% W-1 at 4 degrees C for 24 h effectively solubilized and activated the enzyme. Under these conditions, greater than 85% of the protein in membrane preparations was released, and about 64% of the glucan synthase activity could be recovered in the soluble form. Soluble enzyme activity was stable for more than 12 days at 4 degrees C. Also, glucan synthase activity in the extracted membrane preparations could be activated to achieve more than twice the enzyme activity in the original, unextracted membrane preparations. The soluble glucan synthase had characteristics similar to those of the membrane-bound enzyme. Soluble glucan synthase had an apparent Km of 2.0 mM, and particulate glucan synthase had an apparent Km of 2.5 mM. Kinetics of cilofungin inhibition for both enzyme preparations were noncompetitive, with an apparent Ki of 2.5 microM; both preparations could be inhibited by cilofungin but not by its peptide nucleus or side chain, either alone or in combination. The reaction products from both forms of the enzyme were sensitive to (1,3)-beta-D-glucanase degradation but not to alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, or proteinase K degradation and thus were shown to be beta(1----3) glucan.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ethanol (4.7 g/kg body wt intragastrically as a single dose or once daily for 35 days) on the levels of the thiamine metabolizing enzymes (thiamine pyrophosphokinase, TPKase; thiamine pyrophosphatase, TPPase; and monophosphatase, TMPase) was studied in different organs (liver, kidney, small intestine, heart and skeletal muscle) and nervous regions (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, pons, corpus callosum, hypothalamus and sciatic nerve) of the rat. In order to evaluate the non-specific effects of the stress of gastric gavage and of the additional caloric intake, appropriate control groups of animals were treated intragastrically with water or with a saccharose solution isoenergetic with ethanol respectively. All animals were reared on a nutritionally adequate diet supplying amounts of thiamine higher than the recommended daily requirement. Enzymatic activities were determined quantitatively by biochemical methods. Tissue TPKase levels were generally reduced by both acute and chronic ethanol administration. TPPase levels were generally reduced after acute and increased after chronic ethanol treatment. Changes in brain TMPase levels were similar to those observed for TPPase. In visceral organs and skeletal muscle TMPase activity was increased by chronic ethanol treatment as compared to acute ethanol administration. In conclusion, ethanol exerts a marked influence on the tissue levels of the thiamine metabolizing enzymes: the activity of the enzymes dephosphorylating thiamine phosphates is increased whereas the activity of the thiamine pyrophosphate synthesizing enzyme is reduced. These changes may contribute to an important extent to the disturbances in thiamine cellular uptake and metabolism observed in alcoholism.\r"

We performed direct assays of blood concentrations of free thiamine and thiamine phosphate in excessive drinkers with or without peripheral neuropathy and in control subjects. We found no difference in free thiamine concentrations between excessive drinkers with and without neuropathy, and no difference in free thiamine concentrations between the two groups of excessive drinkers and the control group. By contrast, a deficiency in thiamine phosphate was observed in each group of excessive drinkers compared to the control group. This was reflected in blood concentrations of total thiamine which were also lower in excessive drinkers than in controls. Finally, the thiamine phosphate: free thiamine ratio was slightly but significantly lower in the two groups of excessive drinkers than in the control group. Both groups of excessive drinkers showed typical moderate liver disease of alcoholic origin. In conclusion, the free thiamine fraction was not diminished in this group of alcoholic hospital inpatients. Thiamine deficiency would not therefore appear to play a determining role in the onset of peripheral neuropathy. In contrast, the phosphorylated fraction was slightly reduced, probably owing to the liver disease in these subjects. Contrary to studies using indirect assay techniques, our results suggest that thiamine deficiency is either slight or absent in chronic drinkers.\r"

The major efficacy criterion was plasma gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), as an indicator of recent alcohol ingestion. This analysis was completed by criteria concordance analysis on a number of indicators of alcohol intake. Patients in both groups were similar initially. After 3 months of treatment, the patients in the CA group had significantly lower GGT (1.4 +/- 1.56 versus 2.0 +/- 3.19 times normal, P = 0.016). All significant differences (P less than 0.05) or trends (0.10 greater than P greater than 0.05) were in favor of a superior effect of CA over placebo. The major side-effect of CA was diarrhea (present in 13% of CA patients versus 7% of placebo, P = 0.04). CA proved superior to placebo on the evolution of markers of alcohol ingestion at three months, in this large-scale multicenter study. It could be a new modality in the drug therapy of alcoholism, not involving an antabuse effect, an antidepressant action, or conditioning.\r"

The AcDH-overloaded erythrocytes contained 1.55 +/- 0.25 I.U. of AcDH activity per ml of packed erythrocytes, a value 12-15 times higher than that of corresponding unloaded or native red cells. The AcDH-loaded erythrocytes were found to metabolize 4 +/- 0.8 mumol of acetaldehyde/hr/ml of red blood cells, whereas the glycolytic activity was almost unmodified. Estimates of intracellular adenine nucleotides showed 50% ATP decay in the AcDH-loaded cells when incubated in the presence of acetaldehyde concentrations higher than 50 microM, whereas the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio was strongly decreased but to the same extent as in control cells, suggesting that this was due to the acetaldehyde itself and not to the presence of encapsulated AcDH. Similar results were obtained using mouse erythrocytes. AcDH-overloaded mouse red blood cells from donor animals were also injected intraperitoneally into compatible recipients (Balb/C) and 80 to 85% of these were found to enter into circulation within 24 hr and to circulate with a half-life of 6-7.3 days (normal half-life 11 days). Following an acute dose of ethanol (2g/kg intraperitoneally), blood levels of acetaldehyde were significantly lower in mice receiving the AcDH-loaded erythrocytes than in controls. Blood levels of ethanol were also lower in the treated mice compared to controls. These results show that AcDH-overloaded erythrocytes can perform in vitro and in vivo as bioreactors improving alcohol and acetaldehyde metabolism, and suggest that administration of these cells to alcoholic patients could be of value in restoring to normal, or improving, alcohol and acetaldehyde metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "(1) Liver cirrhosis was induced in male rats by treatment with carbon tetrachloride and phenobarbitone for 130-142 days. Detailed histological examination showed all livers from rats treated with carbon tetrachloride had annular fibrosis, necrosis, loss of normal hepatic architecture and other features that were consistent with an established micronodular cirrhosis. (2) Plasma biochemical analysis showed a significant reduction in total protein concentration (13%), which was due entirely to a reduction in plasma albumin (29%). There were also large increases in the plasma activities of alkaline phosphatase (110%) and aspartate aminotransferase (159%), when compared to phenobarbitone-treated controls. Plasma cholesterol was also increased (67%), but other plasma analytes were not significantly altered. (3) The soleus (Type I), plantaris (Type II) and gastrocnemius (Types I and II) muscles were dissected and examined for possible differential effects. There were minor reductions in all three muscle weights, but these changes did not reach statistical significance. The protein, RNA and DNA concentrations, total muscle content and content relative to body weight in cirrhotic rats were also not significantly altered in any of the muscles. Cirrhosis did not cause any perturbations in derived parameters, i.e. amount of synthetic apparatus per cell, RNA/DNA ratio, apparent cell size, protein/DNA ratio and the capacity for protein synthesis or RNA/protein ratio. (4) The gastrocnemius was fractionated into soluble, stromal and myofibrillar proteins. The concentrations and contents of all three proteins were unaltered in cirrhotic animals, compared to controls. (5) It is concluded that in this experimental model of cirrhosis there were no effects on those skeletal muscle variables which are strikingly altered by chronic alcohol feeding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 5 min, all concentrations of ethanol induced mitochondrial fusion and a remarkable increase in glycogen granules, and the mitochondrial outer membrane seemed more fragile. These initial ultrastructural changes then recovered with time. Glycogen granules were decreased, then returned to normal more rapidly as the ethanol concentration was increased. Mitochondrial fusion and fragile appearance of the outer membrane were hardly seen at 1 hr in the presence of 12.5 or 50 mM ethanol, but were still evident with higher ethanol concentrations (200 and 500 mM), though less frequently than at 5 and 30 min. Furthermore, 'giant mitochondria' (with at least a five-fold increase in sectional area) appeared in the presence of 200 and 500 mM ethanol with increasing time of exposure. These results are discussed in relation to the direct effects of ethanol.\r"

There was a selective blunting of the hypothermic effects of ethanol, but no significant change in the intoxicating effects of ethanol, as measured by evaluation of the righting reflex. The selective effect of exposure to bright light on the hypothermic actions of ethanol suggests that bright light may be modifying the function of only a limited number of brain regions, including the hypothalamus.\r"

Microsomes derived from animals pretreated with the better characterized inducers phenobarbital and Aroclor 1254 were also studied as positive controls. The specific activities (units/mg microsomal protein) but not the turnover numbers (units/nmol cytochrome P-450) were significantly increased by ethanol ingestion compared to pair-fed controls for methoxy-, ethoxy-, and pentoxy-resorufin O-dealkylation. Ethanol ingestion produced a significant increase in both specific activity and turnover number for the O-dealkylation of benzyloxy-resorufin. The degrees of induction of alkoxyresorufin-O-dealkylation activity measured for EtOH-induced microsomes range from 1.7 for methoxyresorufin to 4.8 for benzyloxyresorufin and are small in comparison to the values for phenobarbital and Aroclor 1254. This pattern of induction suggests that the minor isoforms induced by phenobarbital may be propagated by chronic ethanol ingestion.\r"

The purpose of the report which follows is to assess the existing range and level of alcohol services and training in south-east England against which the course was set up, and to appraise the course itself against its aims and objectives. The first part of the study was based on a questionnaire survey of senior administrators in Health and Social Services in London and the South East, and the examination of the course was based on student progress. The results from the first part of the study are bleak. Respondents believed that the majority of clients with alcohol problems were simply not detected, and a lack of resources to mount satisfactory training schemes was among the principal reasons. Only a minority of the organizations provided secondary-level training of any sort, and the majority placed alcohol problems at the bottom of their priorities for training and, by implication, for services overall. The results from the second part of the study were more encouraging. While there was little to suggest that students' knowledge and attitudes changed during the course, there were a number of small changes in behaviour. The most hopeful findings, however, came from students' and managers' perceptions, where one of the most positive outcomes of the course was a perceived growth in student maturity, confidence, and role security.\r"

  ".U": "91197563\r", 
  ".W": "Located close to the crown of the V3 type-specific neutralization loop of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (IIIB) SU glycoprotein gp120, are several potential sites that should be susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by enzymes of trypsinlike or chymotrypsinlike specificity, or by aspartic proteinases. The linkages potentially sensitive to chymotryptic/aspartic proteinase cleavage are retained also within the equivalent domain of HIV-2 (ROD) gp105. We show that thrombin and tryptase cleave HIV-1 gp120 specifically at the tryptic site (GPGR decreases AFVT), and that cathepsin E, an endosomal aspartic proteinase, cleaves at the chymotrypsinlike site (GPGRAF decreases VT). HIV-2 gp105 is also cut by cathepsin E at a site (QIML decreases MSGH) in its V3 loop. Cleavage of HIV-1 gp120 by thrombin is enhanced by sCD4 binding, but is prevented by transient exposure of gp120 to nonionic detergent. Thrombin treatment of HIV-1 gp120 destroys the binding sites for some neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) on the V3 loop, but does not affect the affinity of gp120 for sCD4. Conversely, binding of neutralizing MAbs to the HIV-1 V3 loop prior to addition of thrombin or cathepsin E blocks the cleavage reactions, and the binding of some HIV-positive sera to gp120 blocks thrombin cleavage. Analysis of published sequences suggests that all HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunovirus (SIV) isolates contain potential proteolytic cleavage sites at similar positions in their V3 loops or equivalent domains. We suggest that cleavage of the V3 loop by a cell surface or endosomal proteinase occurs during the HIV-cell fusion reaction, and that neutralizing antibodies directed against the V3 loop might act by inhibition of this reaction.\r"

  ".U": "91197566\r", 
  ".W": "Development of a vaccine for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has proven difficult, and so alternative approaches such as idiotypic manipulation have been suggested. As applied to AIDS, this approach could involve immunizing with an anti-CD4 antibody resembling gp120, to induce anti-idiotypic antibodies which would bind to gp120. The CD4 binding site on gp120 is conserved, and so, such an immune response should protect against all variants. Induction of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immunity has been reported using anti-Leu3a, and this result has led to testing in humans. Negative results obtained by others have been attributed to differences in immunization protocols. Because of the importance of this question, we reinvestigated the potential of anti-Leu3a to induce anti-HIV antibodies, compared with control immunizations with OKT4A (another anti-CD4 antibody) and the irrelevant Ig MOPC-21. Responses to anti-Leu3a showed induction of high-titer anti-idiotypic activity, and included combining-site-related activity. Yet sera showed no binding to gp160 above controls and no detectable neutralizing activity in a sensitive HIV plaque assay, so the anti-idiotypes induced were not internal images of CD4. We conclude that the pronounced anti-HIV responses reported with anti-Leu3a cannot be generalized, and thus that anti-Leu3a does not offer promise as an HIV vaccine. However, these results do not negate the promise of the idiotypic approach, and a vaccine for AIDS based on idiotype manipulation remains a possibility.\r"

Significant reduction (greater than or equal to 90%) in the amount of virus released, as measured by reverse transcriptase, is obtained if the cells are treated for 1 h with 0.01-0.02 microM CPT at the time of virus infection, and expression of viral proteins is also blocked. CPT is also shown to reduce the level of infection when chronically infected cells are cocultivated with uninfected cells. These results with CPT suggest that this compound may represent a new class of drugs with antiretroviral potential.\r"

Supernatants from uninfected cultures of 6083, the human monocyte line U937, and from freshly isolated peripheral human monocytes, were found to contain a monocyte-derived inhibitory factor (MDIF) which interferes with a standard assay for RT. MDIF is a heat-labile activity of approximately of 40 kD. Both substrates and products of the reverse transcriptase assay are degraded by MDIF which is not affected by reduction and alkylation of disulfide bonds. MDIF is inhibited by the addition of a particular thioated oligonucleotide (S-dG30) to the reaction mixture but this addition also inhibits RT. The optimum method to minimize MDIF interference in the RT assay is by addition of ethylene glycol bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA); MDIF requires divalent cations for activity and has a strong preference for calcium which is preferentially chelated by EGTA. The potential presence of this inhibitory activity should be considered when using RT levels as a measure of retroviral infection.\r"

HIV-1 was isolated from 2 of 7, 1 of 7, and 1 of 7 cocultures of splenic, thymic, and trypsin-resistant cells from the liver and placenta, respectively, with peripheral blood mononuclear cells; 20-30% and 40-60% of splenic and of thymic cells were CD4+ lymphoid cells and 40-80% of trypsin-resistant cells were mononuclear phagocytes.

  ".W": "Primary human glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP+) brain cells (enriched population) have successfully been infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vitro, when cocultivated with HIV-1-producing H9 cells. Direct incubation of brain cells with HIV-1 resulted only in a limited infection. The percentage of HIV+ cells increased from 5% in passage 1 to 40% in passage 8. Simultaneously with the increase of infected cells, the reverse transcriptase activity in the culture medium increased and reached maximal values in passage 8. The infected cells also produced intact viral particles. In the early phase of cultivation the HIV-infected cells displayed a significantly higher proliferation rate than the uninfected controls. At passage number 8 the HIV-infected GFAP+ cells had almost totally lost the ability to grow, while the controls proliferated at a rate almost unimpaired from the beginning of the cultivation. Up to 10 to 15% of the HIV-infected GFAP+ cells contained at passage number 5 more than 3 nuclei. Memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane), a blocker of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels, was found to display a significant anti-HIV effect (at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml) on enriched cultures of GFAP+ cells in vitro.\r"

Three hundred and eight men from a consecutive series of 479 men with transmural (Q wave) acute myocardial infarction, admitted to a single coronary care unit, were randomly allocated to eight weeks of group aerobic exercise training or group light exercise. Groups were well matched for all characteristics other than site of infarction, which did not significantly affect results. Mean (SD) physical working capacity (metabolic equivalents) determined by treadmill testing at the start of the study (in the third week after infarction) was 6.8 (2.2) v 6.7 (2.5) METs, at the end (in the eleventh week after infarction) 10.8 (2.3) v 9.9 (2.4) METs, and at 12 month review 10.8 (2.4) v 10.7 (1.9) METs for the exercise training group and the light exercise group respectively. The difference of 0.9 METs at the end of the study was the only significant difference between groups. There were no significant intergroup differences at any stage in resting and maximal heart rate, resting and maximal systolic blood pressure, or rate-pressure product. Apart from a small temporarily greater physical working capacity, the physical benefits of aerobic exercise training were equally well achieved by group light exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The correlation between P pulmonale and right atrial overload in chronic lung disease was studied. Right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and cardiac output were measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter in nine patients with chronic lung disease and P pulmonale on the electrocardiogram (P wave amplitude of greater than or equal to 2.5 mm (0.25 mV) in leads II, III, and a VF. The results were compared with those in six patients with an atrial septal defect (left to right shunt greater than or equal to 50%) and six patients with pulmonary hypertension (mean pressure greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg without left sided heart disease). Right atrial volume and wall thickness were measured in 10 cases of P pulmonale among 1000 necropsy cases and compared with 141 normal hearts from the same series. The patients with P pulmonale did not show a significant increase in right atrial or pulmonary artery pressures. None of the patients with an atrial septal defect or pulmonary hypertension had P pulmonale on the electrocardiogram. In the necropsy cases of P pulmonale mean (1 SD) in right atrial volume (32 (12) ml) and wall thickness (1.5 (0.7) mm) were not significantly increased (40 (14) ml and 1.4 (0.5) mm in the normal hearts). There was a significant inverse relation between the presence of P pulmonale and the cardiothoracic ratio. In all the patients with P pulmonale chest x ray showed a low cardiothoracic ratio, a considerably depressed diaphragm, and a pendulous heart. This study showed no correlation between P pulmonale and right atrial overload in chronic lung disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Eleven patients with coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure were studied before and three months after the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was added to their frusemide medication. The following were measured: left ventricular pressure and volume with transient occlusion of the inferior vena cava, radionuclide angiography, and hormone concentrations in plasma. As in other reported studies, the clinical condition of the patients improved and their exercise tolerance increased moderately. Addition of enalapril reduced end diastolic and systolic pressure, reduced ventricular volume, and concomitantly increased the ejection fraction. The end systolic pressure-volume relation shifted to the left as it did in a similar animal study. In the animal study unloading by a vasodilator did not induce a leftward shift, so it can be inferred that in the present study unloading combined with a decrease in the angiotensin concentration was instrumental in remodelling the heart. Though unloading was expected to have a beneficial effect on the oxygen supply/demand ratio of the heart, the patients still showed the same drop in the ejection fraction during exercise as they did before treatment with enalapril, and early diastolic filling did not improve. Normally, regression of cardiac dilatation is only found if pump function improves; the present study showed that unloading in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reshapes the ventricle without improving intrinsic pump function.\r"

Alcohol (0.5 or 1.0 ml) was delivered after selective catheterisation of the atrioventricular nodal artery in the 10 patients in whom the artery could be identified by cineangiography. The other four patients underwent electrical ablation when the nodal artery could not be catheterised. Temporary atrioventricular block induced by dilute contrast and cold saline (0.9%) confirmed that the catheter was in the correct position before the alcohol was delivered. In all 10 patients complete atrioventricular block developed after alcohol ablation. The block persisted in all four patients given 1.0 ml alcohol but not in four of the six given 0.5 ml. The mean (SD) creatine kinase (MB fraction) at four to six hours after ablation was 76.5 (49.5) IU after 1.0 ml and 75.5 (43.1) IU after 0.5 ml alcohol (normal less than 20 IU). The overall success rate of alcohol ablation in the whole group on an \"intention to treat\" basis was 43%. The procedure was a technical success in six of the 10 patients in whom the nodal artery was identified. Transcoronary alcohol ablation of atrioventricular conduction should be considered in patients in whom electrical techniques have been unsuccessful.\r"

Catheterisation via the umbilical vein was attempted in 37 infants aged less than 48 hours old and was successful in 27. No complication was clearly attributable to the procedure though two infants died. A nine day old child died from disseminated intravascular coagulation the day after septostomy by the iliofemoral route and another, aged nine days, died of necrotising enterocolitis which had developed when he was eight days old, after umbilical catheterisation at eight hours. Balloon atrial septostomy is a safe and easy procedure under cross sectional echocardiographic imaging control. Catheterisation via the umbilical vein was safe, easy to perform, and is appropriate in infants aged less than 48 hours.\r"

Because this difference is often augmented when the circulation is stressed by exercise, exercise tests are a useful part of the evaluation. Doppler echocardiography was used to estimate this pressure difference in 16 adult patients in whom simultaneous pressure and Doppler recordings were made both at rest and during exercise. There was a close correlation between the invasive peak instantaneous gradient and the Doppler gradient both at rest and during exercise. There was only a moderate correlation between the invasive peak to peak gradient and the Doppler gradient at rest and during exercise. Doppler echocardiography is recommended as an easy and accurate method of estimating the peak instantaneous gradient both at rest and during exercise in patients with suspected recoarctation.\r"

Coronary vascular resistance was negatively correlated with age, body surface area, and left ventricular mass. Younger children require a much greater coronary blood flow per left ventricular mass and have a higher coronary vascular resistance than older children and adolescents. These results may indicate that coronary blood flow is less efficient in childhood than in adolescence or adulthood.\r"

Two groups of eight patients were studied. One group (control, or cold) received routine intraoperative and postoperative care. All patients in the second group (warmed) were maintained at normothermia during anaesthesia and surgery; these patients were nursed after surgery in a warm room (ambient temperature 28-30 degrees C) for a period of 24 h. General anaesthesia, surgical care and nutritional support were similar in both groups. A constant nutritional intake, based on nitrogen 0.1 g kg-1 day-1 and energy 20 kcal kg-1 day-1, was provided orally for 7 days before surgery and i.v. after operation for 4 consecutive days. Whole body protein breakdown and synthesis, as assessed by stable isotope methodology, increased significantly 2 and 4 days after surgery in both groups (P less than 0.01), but the increase in protein breakdown in the warmed group on day 2 was significantly less than that in the cold group (P less than 0.05). The increase in leucine oxidation in the warmed group on the 2nd day after surgery was not significant, and was less than the increase observed in the cold group (P less than 0.05). However, by the 4th day, leucine oxidation was enhanced significantly in both groups (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four different subarachnoid solutions of bupivacaine were compared: 0.5% heavy bupivacaine alone, or with adrenaline, fentanyl or adrenaline and fentanyl. The incidence of complications and time of regression of the sensory block were analysed. The technique is recommended because it allows rapid onset of anaesthesia and the advantages of an extradural catheter. The subarachnoid solution of choice was 0.5% heavy bupivacaine 12.5 mg with fentanyl 10 micrograms.\r"

We found no changes in fetal myocardial function with extradural anaesthesia, except for an increase in the right ventricular inner end-diastolic dimensions.

Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1 i.v. and tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium 0.2 mg kg-1. During anaesthesia, ventilation was assisted or controlled with 1% enflurane and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Patients receiving saline showed a significant increase in mean arterial pressure and rate-pressure product associated with tracheal intubation. These increases following tracheal intubation were less in trimetaphan-treated patients compared with those of the control group (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in heart rate following tracheal intubation between the three groups. These data suggest that trimetaphan may be used as a supplement during induction, to attenuate the hypertensive response associated with laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.\r"

Anaesthesia comprised thiopentone, alfentanil, isoflurane and 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Recovery from anaesthesia was assessed using a clinical score, electro-oculographic measurements and reaction times to auditory stimuli. Psychomotor tests were performed the day before surgery and 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after arrival of the patient in the recovery room. Psychomotor performance was decreased significantly after operation in the three groups (P less than 0.05) and returned to baseline at 240 min.

Previously noted disparities between mechanomyogram and electromyogram measurement of the first response of the train-of-four (T1) and the ratio of the fourth (T4) to the first response (TOF ratio) were found in most cases, but were unaffected by pyridostigmine. Pyridostigmine did not affect significantly the overall characteristics of neuromuscular block, but repeated IFP after a placebo unexpectedly produced marginally less depression of T1 and more rapid recovery. The hysteresis relationship between T1 and T4 during onset and recovery of block was confirmed, but was not affected by pyridostigmine. Clinically, the results may indicate that pyridostigmine pretreatment is unlikely to have significant effects on the subsequent use of alcuronium.\r"

IL-1 is the prototype of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in that it induces the expression of a variety of genes and the synthesis of several proteins that, in turn, induce acute and chronic inflammatory changes. IL-1 is also the prototypic \"alarm\" cytokine in that it brings about increases in a variety of defense mechanisms, particularly immunologic and hematologic responses. Most studies on the biology of IL-1 have been performed in animals, but human subjects have recently been injected with recombinant IL-1 and the results confirm the two fundamental properties of IL-1 as being both a mediator of disease as well as of host defense. However, in either situation, over or continued production of IL-1 leads to debilitation of normal host functions; therefore, reduction of IL-1 synthesis or its effects becomes a target of therapy in many diseases. In this review, the structure, gene expression, synthesis, and secretion of IL-1 are described. In addition, the two IL-1 surface receptors, possible signal transduction mechanisms, various biologic activities, and production of IL-1 during disease states are discussed. Similarities and differences between IL-1, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-6 are presented. Although various agents for reducing the synthesis and/or for antagonizing the effects of IL-1 have been proposed, the recent cloning of a naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) has opened new experimental and clinical approaches. The ability of this IL-1ra to block the triggering of IL-1 receptors in animals without agonist effects has reduced the severity of diseases such as hemodynamic shock, lethal sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, experimental arthritis, and the spontaneous proliferation of human leukemic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Pentoxifylline (Trental), used routinely for the treatment of intermittent claudication, has been shown previously to decrease the levels of tumor necrosis factors-alpha (TNF-alpha) RNA in cancer patients and to lead to a general improvement of well being. Increased TNF-alpha levels have been observed not only in cancer patients but also in cachectic patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and TNF-alpha is known to increase the expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) via activating its long terminal repeat (LTR). Moreover, TNF-alpha decreases the therapeutic efficacy of zidovudine (AZT). Here we show a significant decrease in HIV-1 replication by pentoxifylline in infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The reduction was proportional to the downregulation of expression of a reporter gene, the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, linked to the HIV-1 LTR in human monocytoid cells. We conclude that patients with AIDS may benefit from pentoxifylline treatment because of its blockage of TNF-alpha-mediated HIV-1 upregulation, from increased efficacy of AZT, and also from improvement in TNF-alpha-induced cachexia.\r"

Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the RAR alpha rearrangements persisted in the APL samples containing maturing myeloid cells 2 to 3 weeks after the start of RA treatment, but disappeared after 5 to 8 weeks, when the patients achieved CR. Our investigations provide clear evidence that CR occurs at molecular level and that there is reconstitution of an apparently normal, nonclonal hematopoiesis. Further, it shows that RA acts by triggering differentiation rather than by exerting a cytotoxic effect on the leukemic clone.\r"

Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used for prophylaxis against acute graft-versus-host disease. Fifty-seven patients were randomized to receive 2.0 Gy fractions of irradiation daily for 6 days and 59 were randomized to receive 2.25 Gy fractions daily for 7 days. The probabilities of relapse at 4 years were 0.25 for the 12.0 Gy group and 0.00 for the 15.75 Gy group (P = .008). The actuarial probabilities of survival and relapse-free survival at 4 years were 0.60 and 0.58 among the patients who received 12.0 Gy compared with 0.66 and 0.66 for those who received 15.75 Gy. The 4-year probabilities of transplant-related mortality were 0.24 and 0.34 respectively (P = .13) while the probability of moderate to severe acute graft-versus-host disease was 0.33 for the 12.0 Gy group and 0.44 for the 15.75 Gy group (P = .15). The lower relapse probability in the patients receiving the higher dose of total body irradiation did not result in improved survival because mortality from causes other than relapse was increased.\r"

  ".W": "4'-Demethoxydaunorubicin (idarubicin [IDR]) is a new anthracycline that differs from its parent compound by the deletion of a methoxy group at position 4 of the chromophore ring. This minor structural modification results in a more lipophilic compound with a unique metabolite that has a prolonged plasma half-life as well as in vitro and in vivo antileukemia activity. To determine its activity in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 130 consecutive adult patients between the ages of 16 and 60 with newly diagnosed disease were randomized in a single institution study to receive either IDR in combination with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) or standard therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and Ara-C. The trial was analyzed using the O'Brien-Fleming multiple testing design that allowed for periodic inspection of the data at specific patient accession points. After accrual of 60 patients per arm, analysis showed that patients who received IDR/Ara-C had a superior response compared with those who received standard therapy: 48 of 60 patients (80%) achieved complete remission on the former arm compared with 35 of 60 patients on the latter (58%, P = .005). Logistic regression analysis of factors associated with complete response indicated that treatment with IDR/Ara-C offered a significant advantage to patients who presented with a high initial white blood cell count compared with treatment with DNR/Ara-C. The degree of marrow aplasia was approximately the same on each arm as was nonhematologic toxicity. Overall survival for patients on the IDR/Ara-C arm was 19.5 months compared with 13.5 months on the DNR/Ara-C arm (P = .025) at a median follow-up of 2.5 years. We conclude that IDR/Ara-C can effectively replace standard therapy with DNR/Ara-C in adult patients less than age 60 with newly diagnosed AML.\r"

Two percent to five percent of bone marrow TdT + mononuclear cells belong to the T-lymphoid lineage by virtue of expression of CD7 or CD5. Three-color immunofluorescence studies showed that, like early B-lymphoid precursors, most bone marrow TdT + T cells express HLA-DR and the progenitor cell antigen CD34, and about half express CD10. All CD5 + TdT + cells express surface CD3 and T-cell receptor alpha, beta, while a subset of CD7 + TdT + cells lack these \"mature\" T cell features. CD2 is low or absent on CD5 + TdT + cells. Examination of isolated CD34 + cells showed that approximately 70% of CD34 + TdT + cells expressed neither CD19, CD22, CD7, nor CD5, and 15% to 50% also lacked CD10. Thus, a major subset of CD34 + TdT + cells lack lineage-specific surface antigens. TdT expression may be the earliest available marker of lymphoid differentiation, and CD34 + TdT + cells are likely to include progenitor cells for both the B and T lineages.\r"

The defect is known to reside in the marrow microenvironment of these animals, which is reproduced in vitro by primary marrow explants as well as by cloned marrow stromal cell lines. Bone marrow progenitor cells are incapable of adhering to primary Sl/Sld stromal cells or cloned stromal cell lines derived from them to form cobblestone-islands and proliferate. The role of hemonectin, a marrow-specific adhesion protein in the defective hematopoiesis of the Sl/Sld mice, was studied. Indirect immunoperoxidase staining of marrow in situ from Sl/Sld mice showed little specific staining while specific staining was seen in a pericellular distribution in marrow from +/+ mice. Hemonectin expression in several cloned stromal cell lines from Sl/Sld mice was compared by immunoblotting with that in cloned stromal cell lines from normal +/+ littermates. Cell line Sld3, which has the least hematopoiesis supportive capacity in vitro, showed no detectable hemonectin by immunoblotting, while Sld1 and Sld2 showed detectable but greatly reduced amounts compared with normal +/+ 2.4, GBI/6, and D2XRII. Confluent cultures incubated with purified hemonectin and engrafted with enriched progenitors showed a significant increase in the cumulative number of cobbleston-islands and day 14 spleen colony-forming units (CFU-s) forming progenitors (39.15 +/- 3.6/dish; 16.3 +/- 3.1/dish, respectively), compared with untreated Sld3 cultures (cobblestone-islands 8.1 +/- 3.6/dish; CFU-s forming progenitors 8.8 +/- 0.05/dish). Hemonectin-mediated progenitor cell binding to the Sld3 stromal cells was specifically inhibited by antihemonectin but not by preimmune serum. These data support the role of hemonectin in early progenitor-stromal cell interactions.\r"

  ".W": "To define the relationship between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in hematopoietic stem cells and virus production by their progeny, we performed kinetic studies infecting bone marrow (BM) stem cells and culturing them in the presence of hematopoietic growth factors. CD34-positive (CD34+), CD4-negative (CD4-) BM cells were isolated and infected in vitro with the monocytotropic HIV-1JR-FL strain or the laboratory-maintained HTLV-IIIB strain at a high multiplicity of infection. The cells were susceptible to productive infection only with HIV-1JR-FL, and virus production as measured by p24 protein release was markedly increased (more than fivefold) in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3). Macrophage CSF (M-CSF) was less stimulatory and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) had no effect on virus production. Virus production coincided with proliferation of mononuclear phagocytes but was not related to granulocytic proliferation in G-CSF-treated BM cultures. Although peak virus production from GM-CSF-treated macrophages occurred 2 to 3 weeks after infection, peak virus production in infected stem cells was observed 5 to 6 weeks after. Enhancement in virus production had a more rapid onset when CD34+/CD4- cells were cultured in the presence of both GM-CSF and IL-3 for 7 or 14 days. Under these conditions there was a 10-fold enhancement in virus production after 7 days of preincubation and a 50-fold enhancement after 14 days. These data indicate that while the stem cell compartment may be susceptible to infection with a monocytotropic HIV-1 strain, productive and sustained infection is realized only after macrophage differentiation. The lack of effect of G-CSF on virus production is likely because of the limited effect of this hematopoietin on mononuclear phagocyte generation and function.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a potent and selective growth inhibitor of early hematopoietic progenitors and leukemic cells. The cellular mechanism(s) underlying this antiproliferative effect is, however, currently unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that TGF-beta inhibits the expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), and granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) receptors on murine factor-dependent and independent hematopoietic progenitor cell lines without a significant change in receptor affinity. A maximum reduction in GM-CSF receptor numbers of 65% to 77% was observed by 96-hour incubation with TGF-beta. The TGF-beta induced trans-down-modulation of GM-CSF receptors was prolonged, noncytotoxic but reversible, and not due to endogenous production of GM-CSF. The TGF-beta induced reduction in CSF receptor numbers preceded TGF-beta's growth inhibitory action. In addition, the ED50 (1 to 10 pmol/L) for TGF-beta's CSF receptor modulatory and antiproliferative effect was similar. The effect of TGF-beta on cell surface CSF receptor expression was specific, because the expression of other cell surface proteins (Ly 5 and Ly 17) was not affected by TGF-beta treatment, and because other growth inhibitors (tumor necrosis factor and interferon) did not affect CSF receptor expression. These data suggest that the downregulation of the growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells by TGF-beta involves reducing the cell surface expression on growth factor receptors.\r"

Previous work from our laboratory has shown that CD34+ marrow cells can engraft lethally irradiated baboons. Because the CD34 antigen has not been detected on most solid tumors, positive selection of CD34+ cells may be used to provide marrow cells capable of engraftment, but depleted of tumor cells. In seven patients with stage IV breast cancer and two patients with stage IV neuroblastoma, 2.5 to 17.5 x 10(9) marrow cells were separated by immunoadsorption with the anti-CD34 antibody 12-8 and 50 to 260 x 10(6) positively selected cells were recovered that were 64 +/- 16% (range 35% to 92%) CD34+. The patients received 1.0 to 5.2 x 10(6) CD34-enriched cells/kg after marrow ablative therapy. Six patients engrafted, achieving granulocyte counts of greater than 500/mm3 at 34 +/- 10 (range 21 to 47) days and platelets counts of greater than 20,000/mm3 at 46 +/- 14 (range 28 to 66) days posttransplant. Five of these patients showed durable engraftment until the time of death 82 to 386 days posttransplant. One patient failed to sustain engraftment associated with metastatic marrow disease. Three patients died at days 14, 14, and 17 posttransplant, two of whom had evidence of early engraftment. These studies suggest that CD34+ marrow cells are capable of reconstituting hematopoiesis in humans.\r"

  ".U": "91198502\r", 
  ".W": "An elucidation of the interaction between the bone marrow microenvironment and hematopoietic stem cells is critical to the understanding of the molecular basis of stem cell self renewal and differentiation. This interaction is dependent, at least in part, on direct cell to cell contact or cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. Long-term bone marrow cultures (LTMC) provide an appropriate microenvironment for maintenance of primitive hematopoietic stem cells and a means of analyzing this stem cell-stromal cell interaction in vitro. Although LTMC have been successfully generated from murine and human bone marrow, only limited success has been reported in a primate system. In addition, few permanent stromal cell lines are available from nonmurine bone marrow. Because the primate has become a useful model for large animal bone marrow transplant studies and, more specifically, retroviral-mediated gene transfer analysis, we have generated immortalized bone marrow stromal cell lines from primate bone marrow using gene transfer of the Simian virus large T (SV40 LT) antigen. At least one stromal cell line has demonstrated the capacity to maintain early hematopoietic cells in long-term cultures for up to 4 weeks as measured by in vitro progenitor assays. Studies were undertaken to characterize the products of extracellular matrix biosynthesis and growth factor synthesis of this cell line, designated PU-34. In contrast to most murine bone marrow-derived stromal cell lines capable of supporting hematopoiesis in vitro that have been examined, the extracellular matrix produced by this primate cell line includes collagen types I, laminin. Growth factor production analyzed through RNA blot analysis, bone marrow cell culture data, and factor-dependent cell line proliferation assays includes interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-7, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, M-CSF, leukemia inhibitory factor, and a novel cytokine designated IL-11. This immortalized primate bone marrow stromal cell line may be useful in maintaining early progenitor cells for experimental manipulation without the loss of reconstituting capacity and as a potential source of novel hematopoietic growth factors.\r"

  ".W": "Granule membrane protein (GMP-140), also known as platelet activation-dependent granule-external membrane (PAD-GEM) is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is expressed on the platelet surface following degranulation. GMP-140, also expressed by endothelial cells, is part of a new family of cell adhesion molecules (selectins) related to the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM-1) and to the lymphocyte homing receptors in humans (Leu-8/TQ1) and in mouse (gp90MEL-14). The role of GMP-140 in platelet functions remains to be elucidated. In this study, a monoclonal antibody, LYP20, was raised against GMP-140. LYP20, directed against a disulphide bridge-dependent epitope, significantly binds to thrombin-stimulated platelets (12,200 +/- 1,184 bound molecules/platelet, kd = 5.0 +/- 0.61 nmol/L) compared with controls (2,400 +/- 266 molecules/platelet, kd = 2.3 +/- 0.54 nmol/L) and inhibits collagen or thrombin-induced aggregation of washed platelets or platelets in platelet-rich plasma. In addition, LYP20 inhibits rosetting of thrombin-activated platelets to U937 cells. These results strongly suggest that GMP-140 plays an important role in platelet aggregation and platelet interaction with other blood cells.\r"

Flow cytometric studies, using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), showed that Serratia marcescens protease treatment removed greater than 97% of the glycocalicin portion of GPIb but did not affect the changes in the expression of GPIX or GMP-140 that were induced by high concentrations of alpha-thrombin (10 nmol/L). However, Serratia treatment almost completely abolished the increase in platelet surface GMP-140 induced by low concentrations of alpha-thrombin (0.5 nmol/L) and diminished the downregulation of platelet surface GPIX by 60.9% +/- 5.6% (mean +/- SEM, n = 3). When present in 20-fold molar excess, an MoAb directed against the alpha-thrombin/von Willebrand factor (vWf) binding domains of GPIb completely blocked the ristocetin-dependent binding of vWf to platelets but inhibited only to about 50% the binding of alpha-thrombin and the activation-dependent binding of vWf. In platelets treated with Serratia marcescens protease to remove GPIb, a concentration of this MoAb 16,000-fold in excess of the maximum possible remaining copies of GPIb failed to inhibit platelet activation by alpha-thrombin. These studies demonstrate that activation of intact platelets by alpha-thrombin proceeds by both GPIb-dependent and GPIb-independent mechanisms.\r"

Platelet function anomalies including impaired aggregation, increased circulating aggregates, and our finding of shortened platelet survival indicate that platelets may be involved in the hypercoagulability in thalassemia. Consequently, we used a technique based on thin layer chromatography purification and enzyme immunoassay to measure urinary metabolites of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) in nine splenectomized patients with beta-TM regularly transfused, five non-splenectomized patients with beta-thalassemia intermedia (TI), and 20 healthy individuals. A significant 4- to 10-fold increase was observed in the urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-TXB2, 11-dehydro-TXB2 and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha in patients with TM and TI as compared with healthy controls. No significant differences were found in the concentrations of these metabolites between TM and TI patients. Six TM patients received a very low dose of aspirin (20 mg/day) for 7 days. A significant decrease was observed in the urinary concentrations of 2,3-dinor-TXB2 and 11-dehydro-TXB2 derived from platelets. However, the levels of urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha reflecting vascular production and TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha originating from the kidney were not significantly changed. These results are consistent with those of increased in vivo production of TXA2 because of endogenous platelet activation.\r"

Before APC infusion, detectable plasma levels (about 30 ng/mL) of APC-alpha 1AT complex were found in the baboon plasma. At the lower APC dose, APC-PCI and APC-alpha 1AT complex levels were 1.4 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- SD) and 0.8 +/- 0.1 microgram/mL after 1 hour of infusion. At the higher APC dose, the APC-PCI level was similar to the APC-alpha 1AT level during the first 30 minutes, but after 1 hour of infusion the APC-alpha 1AT level was higher than the APC-PCI level, reaching 4.1 +/- 1.2 and 2.9 +/- 1.2 microgram/mL, respectively. After 24 hours, complex levels had returned to basal conditions. During infusion of protein C (1.0 mg/kg in 1 hour), both complexes were detected in low concentrations. Following bolus injection of APC, half-lives (t1/2) for APC and APC-PCI and APC-alpha 1AT complexes of 10, 40, and 140 minutes, respectively, were observed. After 1-hour incubation with 2.5 micrograms/mL APC, baboon plasma contained 1.0 +/- 0.2 and 0.8 +/- 0.1 microgram/mL of APC-PCI and APC-alpha 1AT, respectively. Addition of 10 micrograms/mL APC to baboon plasma yielded 2.5 and 2.4 micrograms/mL APC-PCI and APC-alpha 1AT after 1 hour, respectively. Immunoblotting analysis also showed in vivo formation of complexes of APC with an auxilliary inhibitor but not in vitro in citrated plasma. These data show that both PCI and alpha 1AT are physiologic inhibitors of APC and suggest that when PCI is depleted by a high dose of APC, alpha 1AT becomes the major inhibitor of APC.\r"

One of the monoclonal rheumatoid factor K variable regions was sequenced at the protein level and belongs to the human VK III group, as a high proportion of monoclonal rheumatoid factors and some B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) membrane bound Igs.

  ".W": "Differentiation of a human eosinophilic leukemia cell line, EoL-1, induced by the culture supernatant of a human ATL cell line, HIL-3 (HIL-3 sup) was compared with differentiation induced by defined cytokines. HIL-3 sup induced EoL-1 cells to express eosinophilic granules and segmented nuclei after 6 to 9 days of incubation. HIL-3 sup also induced the expression of Fc epsilon receptor II (Fc epsilon RII/CD23) and an eosinophil differentiation antigen EO-1 mainly on eosinophilic granule (+) cells. Furthermore, HIL-3 sup induced EoL-1 cells to respond to an eosinophil chemotactic factor, platelet activating factor. HIL-3 cells express messenger RNA (mRNA) of interleukin-5 (IL-5), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and IL-3 but not granulocyte CSF (G-CSF). Granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were detected in the HIL-3 sup. Recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2), rIL-3, rIL-4, rIL-5, rM-CSF, and rGM-CSF did not induce eosinophilic granules. rG-CSF induced a few eosinophilic granule (+) cells, and TNF-alpha, which did not induce eosinophilic granules by itself, enhanced the ability of G-CSF to induce them. However, G-CSF and TNF-alpha did not induce the expression of Fc epsilon RII and EO-1 antigen. Moreover, anti-G-CSF, anti-TNF-alpha, anti-GM-CSF, anti-IL-3, and anti-IL-5 antibodies did not suppress the effect of HIL-3 sup on the differentiation of EoL-1 cells. All the data suggest that HIL-3 sup contains an unidentified factor that induces differentiation of EoL-1 cells, and that EoL-1 cells and HIL-3 sup provide an important model for the examination of differentiation mechanisms and functions of eosinophils.\r"

  ".W": "Microscopic intracellular detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) messenger RNA in Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's disease (HD) was possible by in situ hybridization, in tissue sections prepared by a method termed modified acetone methyl benzoate xylene (ModAMeX). The ModAMeX method was initially developed for simultaneous optimal preservation of leucocyte differentiation antigens and morphology. Two biotinylated DNA probes, corresponding to the same BamHI-W (internal repeat) of the EBV genome were used. EBV mRNA was detected in neoplastic cells in 16 of 54 (30%) lymph node biopsy specimens from usual subtypes of HD (lymphocyte predominance, 0/5; nodular sclerosis, 4/22; mixed cellularity, 12/26; unclassified, 0/1). EBV mRNA was also detected in the lymph node biopsy of 1 additional human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related case of HD (mixed cellularity) and in 2 of 4 cases of B-cell lymphomas occurring in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, EBV mRNA was detected in only 1 of 41 cases. Cases of HD positive for EBV mRNA were immunostained by CD30 and CD15 antibodies. The hybridization signals were exclusively restricted to Reed-Sternberg cells and variants. When analyzed retrospectively, no statistically significant correlation emerged between hybridization findings, EBV serology, or disease outcome over the 3 years of the availability of ModAMeX technique. The findings support the contention of a direct role of EBV in the pathogenesis of HD, at least in some cases.\r"

We extracted RNA from selected human tumor cells known to produce at least one hematopoietic growth factor and found high levels of abnormally stable cytokine messenger (m)RNA. Half-life experiments performed after preventing RNA synthesis by exposing cells to actinomycin D before RNA extraction showed stabilization of cytokine messages in tumor cells in liquid culture as well as in human tumor xenografts grown in mice. Exposure to the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) caused enhancement of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) message level in lung cancer cells and in control fibroblasts but elevated levels persisted far longer in the tumor cells. In normal cells, an AU-rich sequence in the 3' untranslated region of cytokine mRNAs confers lability to the message. Although a beta-globin gene expression vector containing this region appears to produce unstable mRNA in lung cancer cells, cytokine mRNAs, which also contain this sequence, are very stable in the tumors we studied. This may indicate that another region of the cytokine mRNA molecule is of greater importance than the AU-rich region in determining mRNA stability in tumor cells.\r"

Using a CSF-1 radioimmunoassay, we surveyed concentrations of biologically active CSF-1 in the peripheral blood of 316 patients with malignant and premalignant hematologic disorders; 75 had a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 12 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 7 chronic myelogenous leukemia, 21 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 106 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; of low-, intermediate- and high-grade malignancy), 46 Hodgkin's disease (HD), 46 multiple myeloma (MM), and 3 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Controls were 64 healthy subjects. The CSF-1 concentration was correlated with the type of disease, status of the disease, treatment status, and hematologic parameters. CSF-1 concentration was significantly elevated in 83.5% of the patients with active disease, and for each active disease group it was significantly greater (P less than .0001) than in the control. Thus, the high circulating CSF-1 concentration was not associated with a particular malignant phenotype or MDS subtype, but did correlate with the disease activity of both NHL and HD, and the tumor burden in MM, AML, and CLL. There was no correlation of the CSF-1 level with total counts of monocytes or neutrophils in patients with MDS or other malignancies. The cellular basis for the elevated circulating CSF-1 was not investigated. However, the results are consistent with the possibility that the premalignant or malignant cells themselves produce CSF-1 or regulate its production by normal cells.\r"

  ".W": "The human AML-193 cell line requires exogenous granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3) for growth in liquid or semisolid medium. However, these CSFs do not stimulate the differentiation of the cell line. We show that addition of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3) induces AML-193 cells to differentiate into the granulocytic or monocytic lineage, respectively. On the other hand, addition of either G- or M-CSF alone exerts virtually no differentiative effect. Terminal granulocytic or monocytic differentiation was observed when AML-193 cells were treated with RA and G-CSF, or D3 and M-CSF, respectively, as evaluated by cell morphology, analysis of surface antigens, and phagocytic functions. These positive interactions indicate that the differentiating activity of G- and M-CSF on leukemic cells may be unmasked by preliminary treatment with RA and D3, respectively, ie, the physiologic inducers override the leukemic differentiation blockade and CFSs exert their differentiative activity on the unblocked leukemic cells. These preliminary observations on a single cell line may pave the way for the designing of clinical protocols combining physiologic inducer(s) and hematopoietic growth factor(s) in the treatment of acute leukemia.\r"

We report that unequal but homologous crossing-over between alpha and delta glycophorin genes results in three hybrid genes encoding MiV, MiV(J.L.), and Sta glycophorins. Restriction mapping and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization grossly defined the third intron as the probable crossing-over site and showed that MiV and MiV(J.L.) genes are arranged in the same 5' alpha-delta 3' frame whereas Sta gene is in a reciprocal 5'delta-alpha 3' configuration. Genomic sequences spanning the extracellular domain exons 2 to 4 were amplified from each variant gene by polymerase chain reaction and determined by direct DNA sequencing. Comparison of nucleotide sequences encompassing the third intron showed that the three hybrid genes differed in location of crossing-over sites. The alpha-delta breakpoints in MiV and MiV(J.L.) genes were localized to the 3' end of the HindIII site downstream from exon 3 and to the 5' end immediately upstream from exon 4, respectively, whereas the delta-alpha breakpoint in Sta gene resided in between. An AAAGT sequence oriented in either forward or reverse direction was identified within the crossing-over region of each hybrid gene whose surrounding sequences bear a strong local strand asymmetry. The single nucleotide substitution in exon 4 of MiV and MiV(J.L.) genes (ACG [Thr] to ATG [Met]) demonstrated that the two genes differed in the delta glycophorin alleles that must have participated in the recombination.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed results of secondary therapy in 427 patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who did not have a durable satisfactory response after primary treatment. At the beginning of secondary treatment, 320 patients (75%) had rash, 252 (59%) had liver dysfunction, and 228 (53%) had gut dysfunction. Secondary treatment was with glucocorticoids (n = 249), cyclosporine (n = 80), antithymocyte globulin (n = 114), or monoclonal antibody (n = 19) either singly (n = 390) or in combination (n = 37). Parameters of GVHD severity were recorded weekly, and responses were determined according to values at the initiation of tertiary treatment or, for patients without such treatment, using values on day 29 of secondary treatment or the last recorded values before death, whichever occurred first. Minimal criteria for improvement or deterioration were defined for each organ, but no attempt was made to define liver or gut outcome if another complication such as venocclusive disease or infectious enteritis was present. Improvement or resolution of GVHD in the respective organ was seen in 45% of patients with skin disease, 25% of patients with evaluable liver disease, and in 35% of patients with evaluable gut disease. Overall complete or partial responses were seen in 40% of patients. The highest complete response rate with secondary therapy (23%) was seen when GVHD recurred during the taper phase of primary glucocorticoid treatment and was managed by increasing the dose of glucocorticoids. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify patient, disease, or treatment factors associated with likelihood of complete response or overall improvement. A similar analysis was performed to identify covariates associated with time to treatment failure (defined as initiation of tertiary therapy or death not due to relapse of malignancy). Severe dysfunction in the skin, liver, and gut at the beginning of treatment was associated both with a decreased likelihood of complete response and an increased treatment failure rate. The times to treatment failure and the proportions of patients in various response categories were similar for primary and secondary treatment, suggesting that the potential efficacy of new immunosuppressive agents for treatment of acute GVHD can be assessed meaningfully in patients who have not responded adequately to initial therapy.\r"

We studied the antileukemic effect of (1) Single-cycle complement-mediated lysis by two different monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) (M195 [CD33] and F23 [CD13] 40 micrograms/mL), reactive with distinct antigens found on early myeloid cells and monocytes, used alone and in combinations; (2) 4-Hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) (80 mumol/L or 100 mumol/L) alone; or (3) combined with VP-16 (5 micrograms/mL) and (4) a cocktail of 1 through 3 as above (combined immunochemotherapy). More than 4 logs of HL-60 tumor cell elimination were observed after 1 hour of incubation with both MoAbs plus 4-HC + VP-16 while the single treatment (immunotherapy or chemotherapy) provided 1.5 and 3.5 logs of colony-forming inhibition, respectively. When the same protocols were tested on cryopreserved leukemic cells from eight patients with AML, we observed a mean value of CFU-L inhibition of 92.3% +/- 2.5% SD, 95.5% +/- 1.4% SD, and 99% +/- 0.8% SD after MoAbs and complement lysis, 4-HC, and 4-HC + VP-16 treatment, respectively. The combined treatment of MoAbs and 4-HC + VP-16 produced more than 3-log reduction of CFU-L colony formation. By comparison, the mean recovery of committed normal bone marrow progenitors after incubation with MoAbs and complement was 12% for CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), 22.9% for burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), and the recovery following 4-HC + VP-16 treatment was 4.4% for CFU-GM and 5.6% BFU-E. In subsequent experiments, highly purified CD34+ blast cells, enriched by positive selection, and stimulated in liquid culture by cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-3, and combination of both) or MO-conditioned medium (MoCM), demonstrated that immunochemotherapy spares hematopoietic colony-forming cells earlier than day 14 CFU-GM, in vitro.\r"

All patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. When examined at 3-month intervals for the first year post-BMT, all patients had uniform measurements of hematocrit (Hct) and serum creatinine. Sixteen patients who initially exhibited Hct and creatinine values that were normal range for the BMT populations developed a sudden decrease in Hct and increase in creatinine between 3 and 11 months post-BMT and fulfilled the clinical and laboratory criteria for HUS. None of these patients had known active cytomegalovirus infection, graft-versus-host disease, or cyclosporine administration. The degree of decrease in Hct and creatinine elevation ranged from solely laboratory abnormalities to a clinically significant syndrome. Twelve of the 16 patients developed acute clinical complications of congestive heart failure, hypertension (HTN), or peripheral edema. Twelve patients required red blood cell support, whereas only four patients required platelet transfusions. Both hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia have resolved in virtually all cases. At a mean follow up of 18 months postdiagnosis, creatinine elevations have persisted along with HTN. All patients have survived without life-threatening long-term sequelae. With the increasing use of BMT as a curative modality for patients with hematologic malignancies, it becomes important to prospectively monitor patients for the development of HUS and its potential long-term impact on renal function.\r"

Autotransplant patients were found to have low responder cell frequencies in tests for lymphokine-secreting helper function, and for IL-2 dependent proliferator and cytotoxic function. Multiple regression analysis showed that function was lower in autotransplant patients than in allorecipients, and lower in male patients for all three functional assays. Patients with clinically significant infection tended to have lower proliferative function in both transplant groups and lower cytotoxic function in the allotransplant population. Graft-versus-host disease was associated with lower T-cell function, but was present only in the allotransplant group; therefore, it cannot account for the even lower levels of function observed in the autotransplant population. Because we observe deficits in T-cell regeneration in autotransplant recipients that are even more severe than in allorecipients, we postulate that cellular immunodeficiency after bone marrow transplantation may reflect limitations in thymic-dependent repopulation rather than an effect of genetic disparity between host and donor (eg, clinical or subclinical graft-versus-host).\r"

Three main patterns of management could be identified: (1) 'conventional treatment', consisting of pancreatic resection or necrosectomy with drainage; (2) 'local lavage', consisting of necrosectomy followed by regional lavage; and (3) 'open management', with resection or necrosectomy followed by planned multiple re-explorations. From this review it appears that local lavage and open management offer better survival prospects than conventional treatment. Open abdomen techniques, however, are associated with an increased risk of complications, such as colonic necrosis, intestinal fistula, and intra-abdominal bleeding. Excellent results can be achieved in specialized centres with any of the three methods, provided adequate debridement and prompt reoperations are undertaken if the septic state persists.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed 30 reports of Merkel cell tumour and described a further five cases in order to establish a database and from this more clearly define the biology of this tumour, prognostic factors that govern outcome, and optimal management. After excision alone of the primary lesion, local recurrence occurred in 39 per cent of patients and regional failure occurred in 46 per cent. In contrast, in patients treated by excision plus prophylactic treatment (adjuvant node dissection and/or adjuvant radiation), local recurrence occurred in 26 per cent and regional failure in 22 per cent. Locoregional recurrence carried an ominous significance with 67 per cent of patients subsequently dying of the disease. For patients who either presented with regional disease or later developed regional disease, the best outcome (44 per cent survival with mean follow-up of 40 months) was obtained following treatment by therapeutic node dissection with or without radiation. In contrast, treatment of regional disease with radiation alone was associated with only a 20 per cent survival rate. Unfavourable prognostic factors included young age, lesions sited in the head and neck or trunk, male sex, and the presence of locoregional failure and/or systemic disease. We conclude that Merkel cell tumours behave in a similar manner to the aggressive variants of melanoma and that minimal treatment consists of wide surgical resection of the primary lesion (with a margin of 2.5-3 cm) coupled with resection and probably also radiation of regional disease if present. In addition, consideration should be given to prophylactic node dissection in node negative patients, especially in those patients with unfavourable prognostic factors.\r"

  ".W": "We considered using a randomized trial to assess the value of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. The pros and cons for the timing of such a trial were in favour of not beginning the trial until surgeons learned to use the new procedure safely and effectively, and until key endpoints and outcome indices could be identified and assessed using valid measures. Instead an observational study was implemented to monitor the learning curve of surgeons as they mastered the laparoscopic equipment and procedures, and to assess the responses of the patients to the procedure. In the first 100 patients, the procedure proved to be as safe and feasible to use as conventional surgery, and there were strong benefits in terms of quicker recovery of the patients with less pain, discomfort, and a reduced length of hospital stay. The responses of the surgeons and the patients to the new procedure now place ethical constraints on the planning of a randomized controlled trial. Currently, comprehensive surveillance and monitoring of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the only realistic method with which to assess the impact of this new technology in our clinic.\r"

  ".W": "An initial experience of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 50 consecutive patients was reviewed and the results compared with those of a group of 25 patients who underwent laparotomy cholecystectomy during the 3 months before the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully performed in 44 of 50 consecutive patients in whom it was attempted. When compared with laparotomy, laparoscopy cholecystectomy was associated with longer mean (s.d.) anaesthesia, 155 (61) min versus 102 (31) min (P less than 0.001), shorter mean postoperative hospital stay, 3.5 (1.5) versus 8.8 (3.2) days (P less than 0.001), and reduced mean cost, pounds 895 (376) versus pounds 2210 (822) (P less than 0.001). Perioperative morbidity was also reduced following laparoscopy cholecystectomy (9 per cent versus 16 per cent) but not significantly so. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe, effective procedure which completely removes the gallbladder. It significantly reduces hospital stay, is cosmetically satisfactory and has financial benefits. We suggest that this technique be considered for all patients having cholecystectomy.\r"

However, no data exist to substantiate these selection criteria. In this study, the selection criteria were broadened to include patients with radiolucent stones of any size and number, and radio-opaque stones less than 3 cm in diameter. To date; 108 symptomatic patients with gallstones have received treatment. All patients received up to six outpatient sessions of ESWL (6000 shock waves per session) without sedation or analgesia. The dissolution therapy consisted of combined bile salt and terpene administration. The clearance rates were 9 per cent within 2 months, 21 per cent at 2-4 months, 38 per cent at 4-8 months, 60 per cent at 8-12 months, and 78 per cent at 12-18 months. Of patients with a successful outcome only 19 (18 per cent) would have satisfied traditional selection criteria. There have been no significant complications except in one patient who developed mild acute pancreatitis, which settled on conservative treatment, and two patients who developed acute cholecystitis. This study would suggest that the previously accepted selection criteria underestimate the number of patients suitable for gallstone ESWL and dissolution therapy.\r"

The case records of 46 such patients operated on for inflammatory bowel disease between 1960 and 1983 were reviewed. Using the preoperative clinical information, pathological and radiological reports, it was possible to divide the patients into three groups: group 1, probable Crohn's disease (19 cases); group 2, probable ulcerative colitis (11 cases); and group 3, indeterminate colitis (16 cases). The patients were followed for a minimum of 2.5 years (median 10, range 2.5-28 years). During this period the probable diagnosis changed in five cases only. One patient in group 1 (Crohn's disease) was subsequently considered to have ulcerative colitis (group 2). The other four patients were all in group 3. Three were reclassified as ulcerative colitis and the fourth as Crohn's disease on the finding of a single granuloma in a rectal biopsy. No case in group 3 required subsequent small bowel surgery. These data suggest that patients continuing with a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis in spite of careful preoperative and postoperative assessment are unlikely to show features of Crohn's disease in the long term. This may be important when considering a subsequent restorative proctectomy.\r"

Emergency surgery for carcinoma of the right colon consisted of primary resection in 95 per cent of cases and was followed by a 28 per cent mortality rate. Perforated tumours of the left colon and rectum were managed by primary resection in 82 per cent of cases with a 22 per cent mortality rate. In contrast, obstructing tumours of the left colon and rectum were treated by primary resection in 38 per cent of cases with a 6 per cent mortality rate, and by primary decompression in 62 per cent of cases with a 25 per cent mortality rate. The overall postoperative mortality rate was 23 per cent and increased with advanced tumour disease, perforation and peritonitis. Cardiac decompensation and intraabdominal sepsis were the major causes of death. Although the long-term survival rate following emergency surgery was worse than after elective surgery, improvements in outcome should be achieved by better management of the initial emergency situation.\r"

Nine patients had undergone previous laparotomy. Enteroscopy was performed successfully in all cases, with fresh blood and discrete vascular lesions being the chief findings (10 of 12 cases). Segmental resections (n = 8) and local resections (n = 2) were performed in ten patients, with two patients having more than one laparotomy for rebleeding. Five patients developed postoperative complications and there was an operative death and one late death. Three of the ten surviving patients experienced further rebleeding. Intraoperative enteroscopy is now an essential adjunct to laparotomy for gastrointestinal bleeding which has been localized to the small bowel before operation.\r"

Peritonitis requiring emergency laparotomy occurred in 8 per cent of the patients who did not have a defunctioning stoma compared with less than 1 per cent of those patients who had a defunctioning stoma (P less than 0.01). There was no mortality related to closure of the stoma but seven patients developed a faecal fistula and ten developed an incisional hernia. Despite current trends to avoid the defunctioning stoma, these results suggest that after total mesorectal excision the faecal stream should be temporarily diverted away from the anastomosis that is 6 cm or less from the anal verge to protect against potentially life-threatening anastomotic leakage.\r"

At 1 year after operation the functional results did not differ between groups 1 and 2 in terms of daily frequency of defaecation (mean 5.6 and 5.4 in 24 h respectively), or in terms of anal basal or maximal squeeze pressures. There was a significant (P less than 0.01) saving in total hospital stay (median 11 days) and in operating theatre time (mean 41 min) in patients with no covering ileostomy.

The nature of the complication was related to initial pathology; thrombosis was far commoner in those with occlusive disease, and enteric fistula and false aneurysm were commoner in those with aneurysmal disease.\r"

One hundred and twenty-four patients referred for venography with a clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis were investigated by light reflection rheography to determine the accuracy of the technique in diagnosing acute thrombosis. In half of the patients venography confirmed a deep venous thrombosis. Light reflection rheography had a sensitivity of 92 per cent and a specificity of 84 per cent in detecting acute thrombosis. The technique had a negative predictive value of 92 per cent in selecting those patients with no thrombosis. Light reflection rheography can be performed at the bedside or in the radiography department which makes it a suitable technique for screening patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis.\r"

In uncomplicated varicose veins there was a median of 6 white blood cells per mm2, in patients with lipodermatosclerosis there were 45 white blood cells per mm2, and where there was a history of ulceration, 217 white blood cells per mm2. No change in white blood cell content was observed after the venous pressure was raised for 30 min by sitting the patient with the lower limb dependent. White blood cell infiltration of the skin is associated with lipodermatosclerotic changes caused by venous insufficiency.\r"

Complete response occurred in 38 women, partial response in 17, no change in 34 and progressive disease in 24. Where progressive disease occurred, or where patients relapsed after an initial response, the most suitable conventional therapy was given. The actuarial 5-year survival rate was 49.4 per cent for all patients and was much higher (92 per cent) in those showing an initial complete response. Seventy patients (61.9 per cent) were not controlled by tamoxifen alone to death or most recent follow-up. Tamoxifen provides an alternative treatment for operable breast cancer in older women in the short term and may be particularly suitable for those with concurrent disease or who are unwilling to undergo surgery. The low morbidity rate from tamoxifen must be balanced against the need to maintain close follow-up. In the medium to long term, sole primary treatment by tamoxifen delays more definitive therapy.\r"

These patients were treated by mastectomy and histology confirmed widespread in situ carcinoma or multifocal/multicentric invasive carcinoma.

Routine preoperative mammography is essential in the management of patients with small breast cancers.\r"

One hundred and five patients (72 per cent) had an acute abdomen on admission and were operated on immediately. The remaining 41 patients (28 per cent) had minimal or equivocal abdominal signs and were observed with serial clinical examinations. Seven of the observed patients needed subsequent laparotomy, but there was no mortality or serious morbidity. Had a policy of mandatory exploration for abdominal gunshot wound been applied the incidence of unnecessary or negative laparotomies would have been 27 per cent. By using a policy of selective conservatism this figure was only 5 per cent. We suggest that abdominal gunshot wounds should be assessed and managed exactly like knife wounds. Physical examination is reliable in detecting significant intra-abdominal injuries. Many carefully selected patients with abdominal gunshot wounds can safely be managed non-operatively.\r"

Full follow-up data to date or death were available for 58 (81 per cent) patients and partial follow-up for 14 patients. The study showed that the patients generated a good deal of investigation and a number of surgical procedures but that seldom were their symptoms attributable to serious pathology. Familiarity with the test, taken in the context of a proper history and examination, has been found helpful in assessing such patients and saves the inconvenience, expense and occasional hazard of investigation, and even surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1977 and 1988, 67 patients underwent surgical removal of residual metastatic deposits following an aggressive chemotherapy regimen (cisplatin, vincristine, methotrexate and bleomycin alternating with etoposide, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide) for disseminated germ cell tumours of the testis (stage IIB or above). Ninety-one surgical procedures were performed. There were 63 (69 per cent) retroperitoneal lymph node dissections, 16 (18 per cent) thoracotomies, three (3 per cent) hepatic resections, three (3 per cent) craniotomies, five (5 per cent) delayed orchidectomies and one anterolateral decompression of the vertebral column. Nine (13 per cent) patients required a repeat retroperitoneal node dissection and one patient needed a repeat thoracotomy to remove recurrent metastatic deposits during the period of follow-up. Multivisceral resections and vascular reconstruction procedures were required in 20 (30 per cent) patients undergoing retroperitoneal node dissection. Fifty-five (82 per cent) patients remain in complete remission with a mean follow-up period of 49.6 months (range 2-121 months). Nine (13 per cent) patients died with metastatic disease between 2 months to 4 years after operation. There were three deaths in the perioperative period (4 per cent). The histology of the resected metastases revealed undifferentiated active tumour in 20 (30 per cent) patients, differentiated mature teratoma in 29 (43 per cent) patients and fibrosis/necrosis in 18 (27 per cent) patients. Twelve (60 per cent) patients with undifferentiated elements and 15 patients (60 per cent) with raised preoperative tumour markers (poor prognostic categories) are in complete remission. Cytoreductive surgery in patients with metastatic germ cell tumours offers the best chance of remission following chemotherapy even in poor prognostic group categories.\r"

Outcome for each patient was assessed using the TRISS system which calculates the probability of survival based on anatomical extent of injury and degree of physiological disturbance at the time of admission. Thirty-nine patients were admitted following major trauma, of whom nine died. Seven of the deaths were in patients with a greater than 50 per cent chance of survival according to the TRISS system. In contrast, four patients survived who had a greater than 50 per cent chance of death. Details of these 11 cases are given. The numbers of patients who were referred to neurosurgeons and cardiothoracic surgeons in regional specialist centres were recorded, as was the relative contribution of general and orthopaedic surgeons in our own hospital. We conclude that, in the absence of specialized trauma centres, a reasonable standard of care for patients who have sustained major trauma can be delivered in a district general hospital.\r"

The cohort was followed for 27-35 years. There was a slight but significant decrease in relative survival rate to 92 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval 87-97 per cent) 35 years after operation. No decrease in relative survival rate was observed during the first 20 years after operation. There was no difference by gender or surgical procedure, but patients operated on for gastric ulcer, compared with duodenal ulcer, and patients operated on at younger ages had a poorer relative survival rate. The effects of partial gastrectomy on survival, both overall and by diagnosis or age at operation, are probably attributable to confounding factors linked with the peptic ulcer disease rather than to the surgical procedure itself. We conclude that partial gastrectomy seems to have very little impact on survival once the patient has survived the first year after operation.\r"

TEE was measured with doubly labelled water containing stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen to allow calculation of TEE over fixed periods from the differential rate of excretion of the two isotopes. Results were available for eight patients in the 28 degrees C group but for only seven in the 20 degrees C group (one patient in this group was excluded as the temperature allocated was not achieved). The groups were similar with respect to body-weight and lean body mass. The 20 degrees C group received more grafts than the 28 degrees C group, resulting in an increase in cross-clamp and bypass times. Mean preoperative TEE was similar in both groups. The mean difference in fractional turnover rates of hydrogen and oxygen was not significantly different in the postoperative period. There was a non-significant increase in the mean 10-day postoperative TEE, calculated in total calories, of 4.7 per cent in the 28 degrees C and 5.1 per cent in the 20 degrees C group. When changes in postoperative TEE were calculated according to lean body mass, the mean increases were respectively 3.7 and 3.2 per cent. Cardiac surgery utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass and intraoperative hypothermia results in only a modest increase in postoperative TEE. In this study a more profound level of intraoperative hypothermia did not influence the change in postoperative TEE.\r"

There was minor hernia recurrence in four (8 per cent) patients. In each instance it was due to partial detachment of the peripheral fixation of the patch. Complications were: wound infection, four (8 per cent); wound seroma, two (4 per cent); wound haematoma, one (2 per cent); and wound sinus, six (12 per cent).

The overall postoperative mortality rate was 0.4 per cent and the morbidity rate was 13 per cent. Only two minor complications were attributed to the anaesthetic method used.

No statistically significant differences in survival time were found between the two treatment techniques. A major problem in the interpretation of the results was the use of semicurative radiation therapy (3000 to 4200 cGy) to the primary tumor and mediastinum, which was given with symptomatic intent. Three long-term survivors were seen in the latter group.\r"

These side effects were promptly reversed after rTNF was stopped and intravenous phosphate supplementation was started. As no significant or consistent increase in urinary phosphate excretion was detected, the rTNF-induced hypophosphatemia probably resulted from an intracellular shift of phosphate. Since tumor regression was clearly associated with the lowest levels of serum phosphate, hypophosphatemia may be important in the antitumor effects of rTNF.\r"

One hundred six patients received radiation therapy (5000 cGy given by two anteroposterior-posteroanterior [AP-PA] opposed fields) and chemotherapy (mitomycin C plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) from 1983 to 1989. Patients with primary tumors (n = 86) had a complete response rate of 84% and a 5-year survival rate of 72%. There was no significant difference in survival rate according to tumor stage. Patients with local recurrence (n = 20) after primary surgery had a complete response rate of 50% and a 5-year survival rate of 40%. Fifteen percent of the patients experienced late treatment-related symptoms including anal incontinence, intestinal obstruction, and chronic pelvic pain. The current treatment regimen is effective but carries a considerable risk of complications. As survival rate was independent of tumor stage, the locoregional treatment should probably be less extensive for small tumors than for advanced tumors. This strategy may reduce the late side effects for patients with small tumors without reducing the survival rate.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of palliative radiation therapy in the treatment of spinal cord and cauda equina compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma was evaluated in 38 sites in 35 patients treated between 1970 and 1990. All patients had radiographic documentation of epidural compression. The median dose of radiation therapy was 2850 cGy (range, 500 to 4000 cGy), with daily fractions ranging from 200 to 800 cGy. Twenty-eight sites in 26 patients were evaluable 1 month after completion of radiation therapy, and symptoms responded completely in 11 of 28 (39%) sites. Fourteen sites (46%) showed a partial response of symptoms. Response lasting until death was documented in 21 of 26 patients (81%). Patients receiving a total dose of 3000 cGy or greater were more likely to achieve a complete response than those receiving less than 3000 cGy (62% versus 20%) by univariate (P = 0.025) and multivariate (P = 0.048) analyses. A treatment program of radiation therapy and corticosteroids is effective in palliating the symptoms of epidural compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma. It is recommended to deliver an accelerated course of radiation therapy to a dose of 3000 cGy or greater without exceeding spinal cord tolerance (e.g., 3000 cGy in ten fractions at 300 cGy per fraction).\r"

  ".W": "Concentrations of bleomycin labeled with cobalt 57 (Co-bleo) over time were measured in vivo in 17 patients with 32 sites of lymphoma and 18 patients with lung tumors after administration of the same dose of bleomycin. There were marked variations in individual tumor drug concentrations even among tumors with the same histologic type, indicating that the tumor concentration of this drug in individuals cannot be predicted from the administered dose. Also, tumor concentration could not be predicted from the area under the concentration over time curve (AUC) of Co-bleo in the blood; there was no correlation (r = 0.53) between the AUC and the concentration in the tumor at any point in time between 30 minutes and 8 hours after injection. There was no significant difference in the percent of the injected dose per milliliter (%ID/ml) which was delivered to the tumor when low and high amounts of bleomycin were administered to the same patient. Also, a good correlation (r = 0.88) between the %ID/ml over time was found when injection of low and high doses of bleomycin were compared. The results indicate that using quantitative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and a labeled tracer dose it is possible to predict what fraction of the dose of a chemotherapeutic drug will concentrate in an individual patient's tumor in vivo. They also show that, for bleomycin, escalation of dose will result in a proportional increase of tumor concentration. This increase depends on individual properties of tumors which can be measured quantitatively in vivo by SPECT and are expressed as percent of %ID/ml of tumor tissue.\r"

For detection of inherent multi-drug resistance, the expression of P-glycoprotein was determined by immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry using the monoclonal antibody C219. For detection of doxorubicin resistance and reversal of this resistance by trifluoperazine, the incorporation of nucleic acid precursor was measured after addition of doxorubicin and trifluoperazine, respectively. Both P-glycoprotein expressing resistant normal and malignant kidney tissue cultures could be modified by trifluoperazine. However, sensitive normal kidney and kidney carcinoma cultures were little affected by trifluoperazine. Thus, circumvention of primary resistance to doxorubicin is not limited to tumor cells. This might have important implications for the use of resistance modifiers in the clinical setting.\r"

Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rHuTNF alpha) was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity using a human malignant mesothelioma cell line [DeH128(m)], both in culture and heterotransplanted in nude mice. In vitro, rHuTNF alone had no direct antimesothelioma activity assessed using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay, but in combination with the transcription inhibitor, dactinomycin (AD), mesothelioma cell metabolic activity was inhibited (80% of control). The effects of this combination of agents were studied on DeH128(m) cells heterotransplanted as subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. In vivo there was no significant inhibition of tumor growth by combined rHuTNF alpha and AD therapy, but the combination produced marked cachexia in doses at which each component (rHuTNF alone or AD alone) was well tolerated. The authors conclude that the well-described in vitro interaction between AD and rHuTNF also operates in vivo to produce cachexia and that the combination of these two agents is likely to have a low therapeutic index in malignant mesothelioma.\r"

The patients ranged in age from 32 to 77 years (average, 60.3 years). No patients had received any specific anti-cancer therapy before tissue collection. All patients but one had underlying liver disease: cirrhosis in 13 and chronic hepatitis in eight. The positive rate of each receptor was 18% for PgR, 48% for ER, and 82% for AR. The titer was highest for AR, intermediate for ER, and lowest for PgR. The titers of PgR in four PgR-positive patients ranged from only 1.1 to 3.0 fmol/mg of protein. There was no relationship between PgR, ER, and AR in terms of positivity and titer. Also, other clinical and histopathologic data did not influence the positivity or concentration of these three sex hormone receptors. It can be concluded that no or little PgR exists in the cytosol of untreated HCC.\r"

The selection of the surgical procedure was based on the surgeon's preference and not on the basis of clinical stage, age, or sex. The surgical results and survival rates were assessed according to the pathologic stage of the tumors. Among patients with Stage I tumor, radical nephrectomy produced better survival rates at 5 and 10 years (P = 0.03); however, when the non-cancer deaths were excluded, the difference in survival was not statistically significant. For Stage I tumors the survival free of disease at 5 years was better for the radical nephrectomy group, but this difference was not statistically significant. No difference was noticed in the local recurrence rate between the two groups. Nephrectomy in patients with Stage IV disease did not alter survival regardless of the type of operation.\r"

Both patients had CD4+ CD45R+ \"virgin\" or suppressor-inducer T-CLL, but Patient 1 had hypogammaglobulinemia and Patient 2, immunoglobulin (Ig) M hypergammaglobulinemia. Although, CD25+ interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors were present on leukemic T-cells of both patient, OKT9+ (CD71) transferrin receptors and OKT10 (CD38) activation antigens were found only on Patient 2's cells. Highly elevated amounts of IL-2 was secreted from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated and concanavalin A-stimulated T-cells in both patients. In Patient 1 with hypogammaglobulinemia, immune defects involve T-cells, first an intense suppressor activity on B-cell-induced IgM and IgG synthesis and, second, deficient production of B-cell growth factor (BCGF) and B-cell differentiation factor (BCDF). In Patient 2, highly elevated BCGF and IgM-specific BCDF was secreted by T-cells, a mechanism leading to IgM hypergammaglobulinemia in this patient. These studies stress the importance of BCGF and BCDF activity of leukemic T-cells in humoral antibody immunodeficiency disorders in T-CLL cases.\r"

Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis revealed that p105 expression was rarely observed in the resting cells of normal gastric epithelium. On the contrary, the immunofluorescence (IF) intensity of cancer cells in G1 phase was approximately two-fold to three-fold greater than that of G0 phase of cancer cells or normal gastric epithelium. The p105 antigen content of cancer cells increased with cell cycle progression, and increased more rapidly in cells in late S-phase than in cells in G0 and early S-phase. Microphotometric study demonstrated that cells in M-phase exhibited a dramatic increase in the amount of the antigen, and the IF intensity of the mitotic cells were approximately five-fold to ten-fold greater than that of cells in G1 and S-phase. These results indicate that the antigen demonstrated by the p105 monoclonal antibody is present in the G1, S, G2, M-phases, but not in the G0 phase. Immunohistochemical technique demonstrated that patients with lymph node metastases are more likely to have high p105-positive rates than did node-negative patients. The mean p105-positive rates of aneuploid tumors was significantly higher than those of diploid tumors. From these results the authors speculate that the measurement of p105-positive rates may be a powerful prognostic indicator of gastric carcinoma.\r"

As a model for this approach, the biodistribution of an anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) MoAb coupled to fluorescein was studied in mice bearing a human colon carcinoma xenograft. In vitro, such conjugates with fluorescein-MoAb molar ratios ranging from four to 19, doubly labeled with 125I, showed more than 82% binding to immobilized CEA. In vivo, conjugates with a fluorescein-MoAb molar ratio of ten or less resulted in a tumor uptake of more than 30% of the injected dose of radioactivity per gram tumor at 24 hours. Tumor to liver, kidney, and muscle ratios of 20, 30 and 72, respectively, were obtained 48 hours after injection of the 125I-MoAb-(fluorescein)10 conjugate. The highest fluorescence intensity was always obtained for the tumor with the anti-CEA MoAb conjugate; whereas in control mice injected with fluoresceinated control immunoglobulin G1, no detectable increase in tumor fluorescence was observed. To compare these results with a classically used dye, mice bearing the same xenografts received 60 micrograms of Photofrin II. The intensity of the fluorescence signal of the tumor with this amount of Photofrin II was eight times lower than that obtained after an injection of 442 ng of fluorescein coupled with 20 micrograms of MoAb, which gave an absolute amount of fluorescein localized in the tumor of up to 125 ng/g of tumor. These results illustrate the possibility of improving the specificity of in vivo tumor localization of dyes for laser-induced fluorescence photodetection and phototherapy by coupling them to MoAb directed against tumor markers.\r"

  ".W": "Catecholamines are involved critically in the mechanisms of liver cell proliferation by acting on hepatic alpha-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors. To identify the role of these receptors in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the density was examined of alpha-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors with their affinity and coupling of beta-2 adrenoceptors to adenylate cyclase in HCC tissue and in nonadjacent/nontumor tissue from the same livers. Studies were also done on healthy livers from age-matched and sex-matched patients undergoing abdominal surgery for nonhepatic diseases. Twenty-two HCC had a decrease of about 72% in alpha-1 adrenoceptor density compared with their nonadjacent/nontumor tissue and a decrease of about 40% compared with healthy controls. Nonadjacent/nontumor tissue from HCC patients had a 125% increase in alpha-1 adrenoceptor density compared with healthy livers. Twenty-three of 24 HCC had an increase of about 180% in beta adrenoceptor density compared with their nonadjacent/nontumor tissue and healthy controls. Beta adrenoceptors were coupled to adenylate cyclase, as evidenced by a guanosine triphosphate-mediated right shift in (-)-isoproterenol competition isotherms and by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production after stimulation with (-)-isoproterenol. The HCC tissue yielded a larger increase in cAMP than nonadjacent/nontumor tissue and healthy controls. The authors conclude that a higher density of alpha-1 adrenoceptors in nonadjacent/nontumor tissue from HCC characterizes the \"healthy\" part of the liver in HCC patients and that an increase in beta-2 and a decrease in alpha-1 adrenoceptor densities characterize the tumor part of the liver in human HCC.\r"

Although an overlap exists between aggressive fibromatosis and the benign group, high values of PK activity are indicative of Grade 2 and 3 malignancy. Significant shifts in isozyme pattern, favoring the expression of K-type subunits were found in tumors with a metastasizing potential and aggressive fibromatosis. These changes in the isozyme pattern of PK in aggressive fibromatosis may act as another argument to place them in the category of malignant fibroblastic tumors.\r"

The RNA transcript levels of GST-pi in the tumor tissues were higher than those in normal tissues in 20 of 25 cases (80%). The mean GST-pi mRNA value in the tumor tissues (n = 25) was significantly (P less than 0.01) elevated as compared with that in background mucosa (n = 29), and in ten of 25 tumors (40%) the level of GST-pi mRNA exceeded the mean normal tissue value by two standard deviations (normal mean value + 2 X SD). The results obtained from the current experiment thus suggests that GST-pi might be a useful marker for human esophageal cancer. No correlation between GST-pi mRNA level and clinical stage or histologic characteristics was apparent.\r"

  ".W": "Postthymic (peripheral) T-cell malignancy shows marked diversity in histopathologic appearances as well as in clinical and prognostic aspects. Histologic findings and clinical behavior of 110 cases of the three specific types of low-grade, peripheral T-cell lymphomas, i.e., lymphoepithelioid (LeL), angioimmunoblastic (AILD), and T-zone (TzL) lymphomas, were studied. There were 74 men and 36 women (age range, 24 to 90 years; median, 58). Histologic study of LeL, AILD, and TzL showed prominent reactive features which are distinct from those of high-grade, T-cell lymphomas (pleomorphic/immunoblastic types). Corresponding to the differences in the histologic pictures of each type, there were differences in the clinical pictures and prognosis. Hypergammablobulinemia (greater than 4 g/dl) was more common in AILD than in the others. However, these three types exhibited a widely variegated, sometimes overlapping spectrum of histologic appearances, and it was extremely difficult to distinguish one from the other on several occasions. The same was true of their clinical and laboratory findings, and they had a relatively favorable prognosis as compared with pleomorphic/immunoblastic lymphomas. Although the conventional phenotypic analysis showed the prominent mixture of helper/inducer and cytotoxic/suppressor T-cells with a varying degree of B-cells and histiocytes, the double immunohistochemical study revealed that the neoplastic cells consisted predominantly of helper/inducer cells. Furthermore, five cases (5%) showed the morphologic transition among the three types or development into pleomorphic/immunoblastic lymphoma. They seemed to constitute a comprehensive and yet distinct group of T-cell lymphomas. Based on morphologic findings and clinical data, the authors demonstrated the distinct character of the node-based, low-grade, T-cell lymphomas and also the relationship among the three types in this group. The results of phenotypic and genotypic analyses also support the concept proposed here.\r"

The median age was 42 years. Virtually all tumors were of large cell type. Three main morphologic categories were identified, with one rare exception. In some tumors, the cells were compatible with centrocytes and centroblasts (four). Others had cells readily identifiable as centroblasts (six). Both these groups had a variable proportion of cells with multilobed nuclei. A third group was composed mainly of unclassifiable cells with multilobed nuclei (five). All had discernible sclerosis of varying intensity. A wider range of morphologic features and different sex distribution was noticed in comparison with previously reported clear cell features and younger women. The dominant phenotype of these B-cell lymphomas was CD19+, CD22+, CD37+, CD21-, CD30-, CD10-, CD5-, and Ig-negative. The finding of CD21-, Ig-negative phenotype, as observed by the authors and others, overlaps with some high-grade lymphomas of follicular center cell origin but is thought to bear similarity to a noncirculating population of thymic medullary B-cells. The tumors attained large size without peripheral dissemination and responded to chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy.\r"

Aneuploidy was observed in 150 cases (55.6%). Multivariate analysis showed that the DNA ploidy pattern was the third significant prognostic factor behind peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis. The 5-year survival rate of diploid patients (62.9%) was significantly higher than that of aneuploid patients (22.7%) (P less than 0.01). This trend was most clear in patients with Stage III and IV tumors. Among aneuploid cases the high DNA index group indicated a worse prognosis than the low DNA index group. It was thus assumed that the DNA ploidy pattern was a useful prognostic indicator of advanced gastric cancer.\r"

Human liver tissue specimens from 70 patients with various histologic findings from almost normal to cirrhosis were examined (using northern blot analysis) for the expression of nine cellular oncogenes. With c-K-ras, four RNA bands (5.6-kilobase [kb], 2.1-kb, 1.5-kb, and 1.2-kb RNA species) were detected in all liver tissue examined. Expression of c-fos was also detected in a few samples examined when 50-micrograms samples of total RNA were applied. Other oncogenes such as H-ras, myc, erbB, raf, fms, fes, and myb were not detected. These results indicate that particular oncogene(s) may not be highly expressed during liver regeneration in human liver disease, or that populations of regenerating hepatocytes may be too small to show significant elevations of oncogene expression. The new finding of a constant expression of c-K-ras in human liver tissue suggests that it is linked to essential hepatocellular function rather than carcinogenesis.\r"

All patients were followed and those with recurrence were investigated carefully. There was no correlation between tumors with an abnormal cellular DNA content (aneuploid or tetraploid) and patient age, sex, tumor site, pathologic stage, or histologic grade. In 236 patients who underwent potentially curative operations, 75 (32%) had local and/or distant recurrence. The recurrence rate was significantly higher (test statistic, 4.3; P = 0.04) for those patients with aneuploid tumors (52 of 142, 37%) compared with those with diploid tumors (23 of 94, 24%). The subgroups of patients where ploidy exerted an effect were in patients with Stage B tumors or mobile tumors and in patients over 65 years of age. Further analysis showed that there was a twofold increase in local recurrence and a threefold increase in distant recurrence in patients with aneuploid tumors, but no excess of patients who had both local and distant recurrence. Measurement of DNA ploidy can identify a group of patients undergoing curative surgery for colorectal cancer at high risk for recurrence. In combination with clinicopathologic factors, DNA ploidy may be useful in analyzing the results of trials and in planning adjuvant therapy.\r"

Furthermore, there was a significant inverse correlation between the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells and the length of survival (P less than 0.001). Serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels also showed a significant inverse correlation with survival, but this was less strong than that for Ki-67 (0.01 less than P less than 0.02). Thus, Ki-67 positivity appears to indicate the aggressiveness of ATL, and can possibly be used for the clinical classification of ATL patients as well as for the prediction of prognosis.\r"

The extent of hepatic involvement of the tumor and that of portal vein invasion were significantly greater in patients with positive HBsAg compared with findings in the negative patients (P less than 0.001). For cases of both positive and negative HBsAg, patients with a more extensive HCC were significantly younger. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hepatitis B antigenemia and younger age were statistically significant and independent positive predictors of extensive HCC.

Patterns of prostate cancer care were examined using sets of branching logic standards in the form of criteria maps. A chart-based comorbidity index was used to control for the effect of coexisting diseases on cancer management. Regression models indicated that patient age affected the intensity of both the diagnostic evaluation and therapy, even after controlling for independent factors such as comorbid disease and individual hospital differences. Patients aged 75 years and older had significantly less intensive clinical staging workups and use of surgical and radiation therapies compared with patients aged 65 to 74 years and patients aged 50 to 64 years. In conjunction with similar results noted in studies of elderly patients with other malignancies, these results suggest that age bias is likely to be widespread. Physicians need to consider life expectancy, the ability of the patient to tolerate diagnostic procedures and therapies, and the quality of life in making treatment decisions.\r"

Four lesions had necrosis, and four had a heavily pigmented malignant component. Four patients had recurrences; ten patients had metastases, and eight died of their disease.

The actuarial survival probability of each group of patients was compared with that of the age-matched and sex-matched control population. The survival of the patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia did not differ from that of the control population (P = 0.92 and, 0.22, respectively), whereas the survival of the patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis was strikingly reduced with respect to the control population (P = 0.0000000007). Thus, in terms of survival, current therapeutic procedures may be considered as quite satisfactory in patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. On the other hand, due to poor survival of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis, new therapeutic approaches for this condition are clearly needed.\r"

The OR for current smokers in the highest quintile of number of cigarettes was 5.15 compared with 3.99 for exsmokers. Those who consumed alcohol were in general at lower risk than nondrinkers. Coffee drinkers were collectively at lower risk than nondrinkers, particularly when coffee was consumed with meals, not on empty stomach.\r"

Education programs were developed for the general public, young people, and the mass media. In 1989, a Working Group of the Society reviewed the guidelines and found them to be valid, the only change being to combine two of them. This paper summarizes recent dietary recommendations of other health authorities, describes progress in meeting ACS dietary recommendations, analyzes the barriers to and opportunities for dietary improvement, and proposes new leadership opportunities for the Society. Concern is expressed that the current guidelines lack the clarity and specificity needed for public education, and that they are inconsistent with recent dietary recommendations of other authorities such as the US Department of Health and Human Services and the National Academy of Sciences. Revisions to the ACS Dietary Recommendations and implications for ACS programs are proposed.\r"

Two lines of transgenic GM-CSF mice were analyzed. The major abnormality exhibited was an elevation in the number of macrophages, eosinophils, and polymorphs in the peritoneal and pleural cavities. Disease states exhibited by the lines were dependent on the insertion site of the GM-CSF gene. These disease states seem best explained on the basis of CSF-mediated macrophage activation and may provide valuable clues as to the cause of comparable human diseases such as malignant histiocytosis, polymyositis, or rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Receptor binding studies with HL-60, JM-1, AML-193, and KG-1 cell lines suggested that the GM-CSF and IL-3 regions had adopted a native conformation within the fusion protein. The fusion protein also exhibited enhanced biologic activity compared with GM-CSF or IL-3 in assays of normal, primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells. pIXY 321 may offer significant clinical advantages over the individual cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "When writing an exercise prescription, the contributions of the pulmonary system are commonly forgotten. The lung has a tremendous potential to improve its work output, and its contributions are only realized when pulmonary disease or environmental stresses of altitude limit pulmonary performance. At altitudes of 5000 feet above sea level, hypoxia is significant in limiting aerobic capacity, and the exercise prescription should follow relative percentages of VO2max guided by the training heart rate rather than actual work output. Training at altitude will improve performance at altitude, but training at altitude does not always improve sea level performance. Suggestions of using longer recovery intervals, sojourns back and forth from sea level to altitude, and shorter-duration, high-intensity exercise sessions may help improve sea level performance, but more research is needed. The limitations of reactive airway disease and exercise-induced asthma can be minimized with proper attention to training techniques, environmental modifications, and pharmacologic treatment. In the 1984 Olympics, 41 medals were won by athletes with the diagnosis of reactive airway disease. Finally, the crippling limitations of chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease can be improved by a proper exercise rehabilitation program that uses an accurate and thorough assessment procedure prior to beginning an exercise program. Also, careful follow-up and continual monitoring of cardiac rhythm, oximetry, and exercise intensity of the pulmonary impaired patient will result in optimal improvement in the patient's sense of well-being, tolerance to dyspnea, and increased ability to do aerobic work, as well as an enhanced quality of life.\r"

In recent years more attention has been paid to the psychologic effects of exercise, and much evidence can be found in the literature to support these beneficial effects. Psychologic states such as anxiety, distress, depression, and coronary-prone behavior have been found to be reduced by regular aerobic exercise. Exercise has also been shown to elevate mood, increase intellectual functioning, and improve self-concept. In encouraging their patients to exercise, physicians can more effectively motivate them by following certain psychologic principles, thereby ensuring greater compliance and adherence to the exercise program. Doing an objective fitness assessment establishes a baseline and creates a stimulus for awareness for the patient. The resulting exercise prescription will more likely be followed if the physician helps the patient establish realistic goals, and understand the minimums of exercise that can still lead to improvement, the exercise physiology behind the prescription, and the physical and psychologic gains to be made from exercise. It can also be extremely helpful if the physician individualizes the program to make it convenient and fun, provides supervision and ample positive reinforcement, and teaches by example, that is, not only be a proponent of exercise, but a participant. In spite of the many benefits of exercise, there are certain psychologic liabilities as a result of excessive exercise. Negative states such as exercise addiction, overtraining, and burnout can be attributed to excess exercise, but they are also often a result or symptom of other psychologic problems. By being aware and knowledgeable, the physician can intervene in this system to help the individual confront the real problems and maintain his or her participation in the sport or exercise program.\r"

Several physiologic mechanisms interact to enhance the body's functional capabilities. Central cardiac adaptations such as improved pump efficiency and peripheral adjustments related to efficient energy transfer are the principle manifestations of proper exercise training. Related benefits of physical activity include reduction in risk from life style-related diseases, increased energy reserves for the activities of everyday living, and an improved quality of life. Functional exercise testing when administered properly can be used to establish safe exercise prescriptions, evaluate patients at risk, and determine program efficacy. The method of choice is a maximal exercise stress test with direct determination of oxygen uptake. Results from such evaluations help to accurately and safely determine the appropriate exercise prescriptions and establish a patient's physiologic profile. The exercise prescription should encompass an approach that denotes the proper application of frequency, intensity, duration, and mode of exercise. For the noncompetitive athlete, training programs should begin with a gentle progression of low-level intensity activities that encourages compliance and reduces risk. Short-term reachable goals documenting gradual increases in activity have been shown to be successful in terms of compliance and desired benefits. Although intense exercise training may be an ambitious goal for many persons, moderate levels of habitual physical activity are a more realistic goal. The clinician should realize that habitual physical activity is an integral part of a healthy life style. Lack of fitness has been strongly associated with all-cause morbidity and mortality. Obviously, the health potential of exercise cannot be realized if a society remains inactive. It is estimated that 40% of Americans are completely sedentary and another 40% are active at levels well below a threshold that would produce gains in cardiovascular fitness and health. This situation exists even though the US Public Health Service has prioritized the importance of physical fitness and habitual physical activity in maintaining preventive health measures and population health status.\r"

The time has never been so right to go forward and onward to the heights with sport, recreation, and physical activity to produce lives worth living by persons with handicapping conditions. George Washington warned: \"We ought not to look back unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors, and for the purpose of profiting by dearly bought experience.\" In this case some might advise not to look back at all, because pessimists and disbelievers may be trying to overtake optimists and believers. As Henry David Thoreau stated: \"If you build castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.\" Physical activity, recreation, and sport are important in physical, mental, emotional, and social adjustment of individuals with handicapping conditions. In many cases, active participation in such activities provides more effective and efficient rehabilitation and therapy than formal rehabilitation and therapeutic modalities and approaches. Throughout history some pioneers striving to introduce and use such techniques and approaches have been rebuffed and rejected by many facets of the medical establishment. Often, progress has come from highly committed advocates from various professional specializations with interests in activity programs for their populations. Although progress continues to be made, much greater recognition by and involvement of the medical profession are needed from the classrooms in medical schools, through all internships and residencies, to hospitals and clinics of all types, and among all medical branches and specialties.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past 30 years, mortality rates from coronary artery disease (CAD) have decreased by more than 30% in the United States. However, CAD remains the major public health problem in this country. There is now substantial evidence linking exercise training to a reduced risk for CAD and for mortality after myocardial infarction. The actual mechanism by which physical activity aids in reducing the risk for developing or dying from CAD has still to be elucidated. Several highly plausible mechanisms have been postulated, including decreased myocardial oxygen demand, increased myocardial oxygen supply, reduced propensity toward ventricular arrhythmias, reduced platelet aggregation, increased plasma fibrinolytic activity, and modification of multiple CAD risk factors. Irrespective of the precise mechanism, it now appears that lower levels of physical activity are needed to reduce the risk for CAD than are needed to optimize cardiorespiratory fitness. In this regard, we recommend that the type, frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise training be modulated to achieve a weekly energy expenditure of between 14 and 20 kilocalories per kilogram of body weight. Although aerobic activities should be emphasized, muscle strengthening and flexibility exercises should also be incorporated into the training program in order to promote musculoskeletal health.\r"

Ten subjects received, by intravenous route, a placebo, 1 gm acetaminophen, and 1 gm acetylsalicylic acid. Analgesia was assessed by measurement of the subjective pain threshold and the objective nociceptive flexion reflex threshold in response to selective transcutaneous electrical stimulations. A close correlation was observed between subjective and objective pain thresholds. Acetaminophen increased both thresholds for more than 4 hours (24% and 23% of baseline value at 120 minutes, respectively; p less than 0.001, ANOVA). In contrast, acetylsalicylic acid had no noticeable effect on either threshold. These findings show that acetaminophen-induced analgesia is centrally mediated, in contrast to aspirin. The time delay between plasma concentration kinetics and acetaminophen analgesic effect is another argument in favor of its direct action on the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "Venoconstriction of the dorsal hand vein by local norepinephrine infusion was measured by the linear variable differential transformer method in 15 healthy unrelated subjects and eight pairs of monozygotic and six pairs of dizygotic twins. Incremental norepinephrine infusion produced dose-related venoconstriction. In unrelated subjects the doses of norepinephrine constricting basal vein diameter by 50% (ED50) ranged from 3.9 to 120.5 ng/min. There was a positive linear relationship between doses of norepinephrine infused and local steady-state plasma concentrations of norepinephrine achieved in each subject. The reciprocals of the slopes of these dose-concentration relationships, which reflect local norepinephrine clearance (disposition) in the vein, ranged from 0.47 to 1.86 ml/min. Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine associated with reduction of basal vein diameter by 50% (EC50) ranged from 1.4 to 110.2 ng/ml, with variability similar to that of ED50. There was a very high level of concordance in ED50, EC50, and clearance of norepinephrine within pairs of monozygotic twins but not within dizygotic twins. Differences in pharmacokinetics of infused norepinephrine exert a minor impact on overall intersubject variability. Genetic aspects of \"tissue responsiveness\" (i.e., vascular alpha-adrenoceptor response, smooth muscle contractility, and endothelial function) appear to be largely responsible for the wide intersubject variability in venoconstrictor responsiveness to norepinephrine.\r"

Inhibition of the morning increase in platelet aggregation would be of therapeutic benefit. In this study the effect of the selective alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine on platelet aggregation was evaluated in healthy subjects. Yohimbine administered orally selectively antagonized epinephrine but not collagen, arachidonic acid, or adenosine diphosphate-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation. The lowest dose of yohimbine that significantly inhibited epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation was 8 mg. The inhibitory effect of yohimbine on platelet aggregation lasted 10 hours with the 12 mg dose. At the doses studied (4, 8, and 12 mg), yohimbine did not modify blood pressure, standing heart rate, or plasma catecholamine or glucose concentrations. Twelve milligrams of yohimbine moderately but significantly accelerated supine heart rate (mean maximal increase, 7 +/- 3 beats/min). Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate whether bedtime administration of 12 mg yohimbine may block the morning increase in epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation.\r"

Three randomized, double-blind, crossover trials evaluated standardized submaximal exercise hemodynamics after oral verapamil (120 mg) and beta-blocker, alone and in combination, in groups of eight healthy men. The beta-blockers were propranolol (80 mg), metoprolol (100 mg), and pindolol (5 mg). During submaximal exercise, each beta-blocker produced similar reductions in heart rate. Likewise, each verapamil and beta-blocker combination caused greater decreases in heart rate and prolongation of PR interval than did either drug alone. Only the verapamil and propranolol combination produced greater reduction of systolic blood pressure and prolongation of rate-adjusted PR interval. All verapamil and beta-blocker combinations caused frequent adverse events, predominantly exercise fatigue and resting first-degree heart block. Although the verapamil and metoprolol or pindolol combinations produced lesser negative dromotropic or inotropic effects compared with verapamil and propranolol, coadministration of verapamil and any beta-blocker should be performed cautiously.\r"

Blood pressure was reduced by ketanserin both after the initial dose (p less than 0.01) and after 4 weeks of treatment (p less than 0.01). During placebo, serotonin, 1 ng/kg/min, increased forearm blood flow by 51% +/- 9% (p less than 0.01), whereas the highest dose induced a decrease in flow (-33% +/- 6%; p less than 0.01). Methoxamine elicited a vasoconstriction (p less than 0.001). These effects of serotonin and methoxamine were not influenced by either the initial dose of ketanserin or after 4 weeks of treatment. It is concluded that serotonin cannot be considered a general endogenous pressor agent in these patients. The antihypertensive effects of ketanserin cannot be attributed to either vascular alpha 1-receptor or serotonin, type 2, receptor blockade.\r"

Plasma levels of cobalamin, folate, homocysteine, and methionine were determined in 40 patients before and after operation under nitrous oxide anesthesia (range of exposure time, 70 to 720 minutes). Twelve patients anesthetized with total intravenous anesthesia served as control subjects (range of exposure time, 115 to 600 minutes). Postoperative plasma levels of folate and homocysteine increased (p less than 0.001) up to 220% and 310%, respectively, in nitrous oxide-exposed patients, whereas plasma levels of methionine decreased (p less than 0.025). Response occurred after 75 minutes of nitrous oxide exposure. The percentage increase of plasma folate and homocysteine correlated significantly with exposure time (p less than 0.025 and p less than 0.0001, respectively). In eight patients receiving nitrous oxide anesthesia plasma homocysteine levels had not returned to preoperative levels within 1 week (p less than 0.01). Urinary excretion of folate and homocysteine increased during and after nitrous oxide exposure (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.002, respectively) and correlated with exposure time (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.005, respectively). It can be concluded that disturbance of homocysteine and folate metabolism by nitrous oxide develops with little delay and return to normal levels requires several days. Elevation of plasma homocysteine levels may therefore be used for monitoring nitrous oxide-induced cobalamin inactivation.\r"

The total plasma clearance of sulfamethoxazole was found to be increased in cystic fibrosis (0.0262 +/- 0.0064 L/hr/kg) when compared with that found in control subjects (0.0188 +/- 0.0043 L/hr/kg). This increase in clearance was found to be primarily attributable to an increase in the metabolic clearance of sulfamethoxazole to N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole (0.00903 +/- 0.00247 versus 0.00355 +/- 0.00049 L/hr/kg) with the renal clearance of sulfamethoxazole remaining unchanged. These conclusions were not altered when the pharmacokinetic parameters were computed for the unbound drug or when they were normalized with respect to body surface area. These data indicate that, in cystic fibrosis, the enzymes mediating the metabolism of sulfamethoxazole to N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole, N-acetyltransferase(s), may be induced, activated, or both, or that the uptake of sulfamethoxazole by cells that metabolize sulfamethoxazole to N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole is enhanced. The total plasma clearance of trimethoprim was also found to be increased in cystic fibrosis (0.1808 +/- 0.0440 L/hr/kg) when compared with that found in control subjects (0.1139 +/- 0.0193 L/hr/kg). In contrast to sulfamethoxazole, this increase in clearance was found to be primarily attributable to an increase in the renal clearance of trimethoprim (0.1240 +/- 0.0299 versus 0.0720 +/- 0.0166 L/hr/kg). These data indicate that the tubular secretion of trimethoprim may be enhanced in cystic fibrosis.\r"

Each of 62 normal volunteers was given a 50 mg capsule of dextromethorphan hydrobromide and collected urine (0 to 8 hours) and saliva (at 3 hours). Dextromethorphan and dextrorphan in saliva and urine were assayed by HPLC. The distributions of paired urinary and 3-hour salivary metabolic ratios of samples from 61 subjects were compared. The urinary and salivary metabolic ratios were distributed trimodally and bimodally, respectively. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient for logarithm of urinary metabolic ratio vs that of salivary metabolic ratio was 0.704. All the poor metabolizers identified by urinary metabolic ratio were also identified by the metabolic ratio in saliva at 3 hours (100% concordance). This study demonstrates that salivary analysis for determination of dextromethorphan metabolic phenotype is feasible.\r"

Ten subjects received fluconazole, 200 mg orally, and 10 received placebo daily on study days 8 to 21.

Serum phenytoin area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours increased 75% and minimum plasma drug concentration increased 128% after administration of fluconazole, 200 mg/day, for 14 days. These values were significantly greater than the 5% increase in area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours and 11.6% increase in minimum plasma drug concentration in the placebo group. Fluconazole trough concentrations remained unchanged during the coadministration of phenytoin. The increased phenytoin concentrations in the presence of fluconazole suggest that fluconazole inhibits phenytoin metabolism. Serum concentration monitoring with a reduction in phenytoin dosage is clinically warranted in patients receiving phenytoin and concomitant fluconazole therapy.\r"

The model was tested by fitting the kinetic and heart rate data from an earlier study. The data from five subjects in that study were well fit by the model: mean Emax, 64 beats/min, and mean drug concentration producing 50% of Emax, 838 ng cocaine/ml. The data from the other three subjects in that study were fit well, employing a linear rather than an Emax drug effect relationship: mean effect coefficient, 0.035 beats/min/ng cocaine/ml. The findings emphasize the importance of conditioning in the responses to psychoactive drugs.\r"

The peak plasma concentration appeared 1 to 2 hours after administration, followed by a biexponential decline with half life values of about 1 and 7 hours, respectively. The mean oral clearance was 16 L/hr. Biochemically, the capacity of the platelets to form thromboxane A2 ex vivo (serum) was inhibited greater than 90% at both doses. In contrast to the short plasma half-life, the suppression of ex vivo serum thromboxane production was maintained greater than 70% to 80% at 48 hours after dosing. Inhibition of the thromboxane production in vivo (urine) was also substantial, but incomplete at both doses (200 mg daily; thromboxane B2, 75%; 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2, 83%; 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, 90%). The urinary excretion, however, returned to the predose level at the end of a 1-week follow-up period after the last dosing. In conclusion, CGS 12970 is an orally active, reversible inhibitor of thromboxane synthase with a prolonged duration of action in humans.\r"

A two-compartment model was sufficient to describe the kinetics of morphine in ventricular CSF. Morphine diffuses to the lumbar level, and the mean maximum concentration was 192 +/- 105 ng/ml at 4.5 +/- 1.3 hours. Ventricular and lumbar CSF morphine kinetics showed a similar decline during the elimination phase, with terminal half-lives of 3.8 +/- 0.6 hours and 4.2 +/- 1.6 hours, respectively. Pain relief was evaluated by a visual analog scale: the test showed a rapid onset of analgesia (less than 10 minutes). Analgesic effectiveness reached a maximum between 6 and 10 hours. The relationship between pharmacologic effect and morphine concentrations in ventricular CSF resulted in an anticlockwise hysteresis curve. The presence of morphine in lumbar CSF suggested an additive spinal action of morphine, which probably plays a role in the duration of analgesia.\r"

Before and after each fenoldopam dose, thermodilution cardiac output, right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) were measured with a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter, and heart rates and blood pressures were recorded with an automated sphygmomanometer. Compared with fasting, bioavailability of fenoldopam was decreased significantly when administered with food: mean peak plasma fenoldopam level decreased from 26.5 (+/- 4.1 SEM) ng/ml to 10.9 (+/- 1.7 SEM) ng/ml (p = 0.0004) and mean area under the concentration-time curve was decreased from 44.7 (+/- 5.8 SEM) ng.hr/ml to 26.8 (+/- 4.1 SEM) ng.hr/ml (p = 0.0001). Fenoldopam administration to fasting patients resulted in decreases in mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and PCWP and significant increases in cardiac index without change in heart rate. The maximum changes in mean cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and PCWP were greatest 1 hour after oral administration and did not persist beyond 3 hours after administration. In fasting patients, changes in cardiac index were correlated with plasma fenoldopam levels, whereas changes in PCWP and mean arterial pressure did not correlate significantly with the observed fenoldopam level.\r"

After an intravenous dose of 14C-fosinoprilat (7.5 mg), total body clearance of fosinoprilat was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) in patients with normal renal function than in renally impaired patients but was not related to the degree of renal impairment in patients with creatinine clearance values of 11 to 72 ml/min/1.73 m2. Decreases in renal clearance were compensated for by increases in hepatic clearance, so that total clearance was maintained. After oral 14C-fosinopril (10 mg), plasma kinetics and bioavailability of fosinoprilat were similar for the three groups of renally impaired patients. The dual elimination of fosinoprilat by the liver and the kidney distinguishes fosinopril from other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.\r"

With this intermittent schedule both drugs improved sleep, with about one-third reduction in total wake time; this reduction was significant for temazepam but not for triazolam. Even though the periods of drug administration were quite brief, withdrawal of triazolam consistently produced rebound insomnia, with increases in total wake time above baseline of 61% and 51%, respectively, for the first night of each withdrawal period. With temazepam this effect was more variable, with total wake time increased only with the second withdrawal period (39%). Thus these findings indicate that even under conditions of brief, intermittent use and withdrawal, triazolam and, to a lesser degree, temazepam produce rebound insomnia after abrupt withdrawal, thereby predisposing to drug-taking behavior and increasing the potential for drug dependence.\r"

The ECG and chest x-ray add useful information to the history and physical examination. Echocardiography, Doppler, and color flow Doppler techniques have an important role in defining the presence and severity of valvular stenosis and regurgitation. Nuclear techniques provide useful information about global biventricular systolic function, regional wall motion, and myocardial perfusion. Exercise testing is most valuable in confirming objectively the patient's functional status and exercise tolerance. Newer imaging techniques, such as cine CT and MRI, are capable of displaying and measuring cardiac chamber size and myocardial thickness; however, visualization of the cardiac valves and demonstration of flow abnormalities are difficult, limiting the current usefulness of these techniques in patients with valvular heart disease.\r"

When exposed to 30 mM glucose, 70% of 52 primary cultures of human endothelial cells, each derived from a single umbilical vein, showed increased levels of fibronectin (median 181% of control, range 104-549%) and collagen IV mRNA (175% of control, range 101-807%). The response of the two transcripts to high glucose was concordant in 77% of the 52 cultures studied (P = 0.01), required 5 days of exposure, and was accompanied by proportionally increased synthesis of the respective protein. Laminin B1 expression was also upregulated by high glucose, concordantly with that of fibronectin and collagen IV. Increased fibronectin and collagen IV mRNA levels resulted from increased gene transcription (median 183 and 236% of control, respectively) without evidence of translational regulation, were not triggered by hypertonicity or signals originating from the matrix, and were also induced by hexoses with limited (D-galactose) or no (L-glucose) access to metabolic pathways but capable of inducing nonenzymatic glycosylation. There was no amplification of the overexpressed genes. Thus, high glucose upregulates in a coordinated fashion the transcription of genes coding for basement membrane components through effects exerted intracellularly or at the cell-matrix boundary and modulated by individual characteristics of the target cells.\r"

Axonal transport has previously been evaluated by indirect methods. In this study, direct-measurement techniques were applied (with computer-enhanced video-recorded images) for the first time to evaluate intra-axonal organelle speed and frequency (the amount of organelle traffic) in both the anterograde fast component (AFC) and retrograde fast component (RFC) of axonal transport in diabetic nerve. Sciatic nerve and dorsal and ventral nerve roots were studied in the animal model of insulin-dependent diabetes (BB/Wistar rat) and sciatic nerve in the non-insulin-dependent (streptozocin-induced) model of diabetes (STZ-D rat). STZ-D rats were studied at 1 mo, and BB/Wistar rats were studied at 1 and 2 mo of diabetes duration. Statistically significant decreases in peripheral axon organelle speed were found only for RFC at 1 mo of diabetes in both the BB/Wistar (8.1%) and STZ-D (5.4%) rats. The difference was no longer significant in BB/Wistar rats at 2 mo of diabetes. This recovery suggests that the underlying abnormality is reversible. No differences were seen in AFC of any axons, and the only other difference seen was a 5.1% decrement in RFC at 2 mo in the ventral roots. No significant difference was observed in any group for organelle frequencies. Other factors should be considered to explain the decrease in materials transported in accumulation studies. The transient deficits in RFC speed observed remain of undetermined significance in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy.\r"

In multivariate analysis, taking only age into consideration as a confounding factor, low initial concentration of SHBG was significantly correlated to the incidence of NIDDM and stroke, and high initial concentration of CBG was correlated to the incidence of NIDDM. There were also significant correlations between SHBG and CBG concentrations on one hand and possible risk factors for the end points studied, such as serum triglycerides, serum cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, body mass, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, smoking habits, and systolic blood pressure, on the other. When these possible confounders, in addition to age, were taken into consideration in multivariate analyses, only the inverse significant correlation between SHBG and NIDDM remained. The increased incidence of diabetes was confined to the lowest quintile of SHBG values, where it was 5-fold higher than in the remaining group. This incidence was further increased to 8- and 11-fold in the lowest 10 and 5% of the values, respectively. We conclude that SHBG is a uniquely strong independent risk factor for the development of NIDDM in women.\r"

Recipients of kidney subcapsular islets displayed normal growth rate, peripheral serum glucose and insulin levels, and metabolic parameters. However, their functional reserve was markedly reduced as revealed by diminished glucose tolerance and reduced insulin-secreting capacity after an intravenous glucose challenge. Vascularized whole-organ pancreatic grafts with portal venous drainage led to complete normalization of all parameters determined in this study. This study showed that the long-term function of islets transplanted under the kidney capsule is superior compared with islets transplanted into the portal vein.\r"

Both phases of insulin release were blunted when 20 mM L-leucine was tested; the secretory response to a subsequent leucine stimulation was also blunted compared with the control group. The ability of 20 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate to stimulate the release of insulin was also greatly diminished in islets from glucose-infused rats. The secretory response to 50 microM tolbutamide plus 7 mM glucose by perifused islets from glucose-infused rats was 45% lower than in the control group. In addition, the response to a subsequent 10 mM glucose stimulation was lost. On the other hand, islets from glucose-infused rats responded to 20 microM forskolin plus 16.7 mM glucose with on significant change in the amount of insulin released during both phases of stimulation compared with the control group. The response to 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was 3.1-fold higher in islets from glucose-infused compared with saline-infused rats. The finding that chronic infusions of glucose lead to selective impairment of the secretory response to fuel stimuli and agents such as tolbutamide that act on metabolically regulated K+ channels gives support to the notion that alterations in the generation of metabolic coupling signals might be involved in the phenomenon described here.\r"

There was no labeling of GLUT4 in endothelial cells of the capillaries. There also was no labeling of GLUT4 on the surface plasma membrane (sarcolemma) under either basal or insulin-stimulated conditions. Specific labeling for GLUT4 was clearly observed in two compartments: within the triad (on terminal cisternae and transverse tubules) and on an intracellular compartment, possibly sarcoplasmic tubules. Isolated triad membranes from rat muscle also contained substantial quantities of GLUT4 transporter, but there was no detectable GLUT4 protein in isolated sarcolemmal membranes. These data suggest a possible mechanism that involves glucose transport across the muscle cell at the transverse tubule membrane, not the sarcolemma.\r"

Dogs were infused peripherally with insulin (18-21 pmol.kg-1.min-1) for 150 min to induce systemic hypoglycemia. During the liver-clamp (LC) protocol, glucose was infused via the portal vein to maintain euglycemia at the liver. In control experiments, i.e., matched infusion (MI), glucose was infused peripherally at a rate determined to yield similar arterial glycemia levels in the two protocols. Arterial glucose concentrations were not different between protocols during the final hour of insulin infusion (3.26 +/- 0.21 and 3.25 +/- 0.21 mM during LC and MI, respectively; P = 0.91). Calculated hepatic glucose concentrations during the same period were significantly higher for LC (5.22 +/- 0.23 mM) than for MI (3.25 +/- 0.21 mM). During MI, both epinephrine and norepinephrine rose significantly from basal values of 562 +/- 87 pM and 1.21 +/- 0.19 nM to plateaus of 3691 +/- 1097 pM (P = 0.0001) and 2.38 +/- 0.35 nM (P = 0.0002), respectively. However, during LC, the elevation in epinephrine was suppressed by 42 +/- 8% (P = 0.015) relative to MI. Six of seven animals demonstrated a suppression in the norepinephrine response, averaging 32 +/- 13% (NS, P = 0.068). The glucagon response to hypoglycemia was unaffected by the level of hepatic glycemia. Hepatic hypoglycemia is essential to produce the full sympathoadrenal response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia.\r"

To assess the importance of endogenous insulin release in regulation of normal fetal growth, eight fetal lamb pairs were given either an intravenous injection of streptozocin (STZ), a nitrosourea that selectively damages pancreatic beta-cells, or buffer infusion (controls). In six preparations, twins were used, and in two cases, triplets, thus allowing for comparison between treated and control fetuses residing in the same intrauterine environment. Fetal STZ injection was associated with relative fetal hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and a decrease in the fetal plasma insulin-glucose ratio. Fetal lambs exposed to STZ also developed a mild nonprogressive metabolic acidosis compared with controls. Fetal body weight was depressed by 21% overall, the magnitude of reduction related to length of time in utero after STZ injection. Similar reductions in organ weights (liver, heart, and kidney) were also observed in STZ-administered fetuses compared with controls. Protein accretion in carcass, liver, and kidney after STZ was also depressed, but no significant changes in fetal lipid accretion were observed. Skeletal growth, as measured by tail and tibial lengths, was also depressed after STZ but to a lesser extent than body weight or protein accretion. Thus, in a stable maternal environment, isolated fetal insulin deficiency is associated with significant retardation of somatic and skeletal growth and protein deposition.\r"

To address the issue of this distinction, we studied the ability of insulin to stimulate colony formation in primary cultures of erythroid progenitors (assumed to retain environmental influences) and immortalized T lymphocytes (presumed to reflect only genetic influences). Four patients with hyperinsulinemia and disturbed glucose metabolism were studied (2 patients with acanthosis nigricans, 1 of whom had circulating anti-insulin-receptor antibodies, 1 with partial lipodystrophy, and 1 with Cushing's syndrome). The mean colony-forming ability of their erythroid progenitor cells in response to insulin stimulation (less than or equal to 1.6 pM) was significantly blunted compared with control cells (P less than 0.05). The mean responsiveness of their immortalized T-lymphoblast cell lines to similar insulin concentrations was no different than that of control T-lymphocyte lines, consistent with an acquired cause for the observed insulin resistance in each case. A T-lymphocyte line from a patient with leprechaunism, however, showed no stimulation in response to physiological concentrations of insulin. With these same in vitro methodologies, there was normal T-lymphocyte line responsiveness to insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) or insulin concentrations greater than 8.6 pM; both of these responses could be completely blocked by preincubation with an antibody to the IGF-I receptor. These findings suggest that, despite resistance to physiological levels of insulin, the high circulating insulin concentrations present in the serum of these patients could mediate unwanted tissue-specific growth through an intact IGF-I receptor-effector mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of alginate-polylysine-alginate microencapsulation on glucose-induced insulin secretion by rat islets. Applying the encapsulation method originally described by Lim, we found severely reduced in vitro insulin release (expressed as picomoles of insulin.10 islets-1.45 min-1 when incubated in 16.5 mM glucose), because the insulin release with encapsulated islets was 1.42 +/- 0.49 compared to 13.58 +/- 0.80 with free control islets. This could not be explained by inadequate permeability of the capsule, because insulin release was also severely reduced (2.12 +/- 0.61) when islets were subjected to the procedure but without the membrane-forming polylysine step. Therefore, islets were tested after having been subjected separately to each of the steps of the procedure. Insulin release was not affected by either alginate or CaCl2 but was severely reduced after prolonged suspension in saline or treatment with citrate. When saline and citrate were replaced by Ca2(+)-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB) and 1 mM EGTA, respectively, insulin release improved significantly both with complete and with incomplete (no polylysine step) encapsulation. This outcome was verified in a set of experiments run in parallel with islets derived from the same isolation procedure. Insulin release was 1.20 +/- 0.23 from islets encapsulated with the method of Lim and 10.73 +/- 1.04 from free control islets. With the modified procedure, insulin release was 9.17 +/- 0.52 vs. 9.61 +/- 1.27 for complete versus incomplete encapsulation, respectively. We conclude that Ca2(+)-free KRBB instead of saline and EGTA instead of citrate should be used to obtain an adequate insulin response from encapsulated islets and that the capsule membrane as such has no influence on glucose and insulin diffusion.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that the decline in glucose tolerance with age is not a primary aging effect but is secondary to a combination of other age-associated characteristics, i.e., disease, medication, obesity, central and upper-body fat deposition, and inactivity. To test this hypothesis, we first eliminated from analysis the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants with identifiable diseases or medications known to influence glucose tolerance. Seven hundred forty-three men and women, aged 17-92 yr, remained for analysis. As indices of fatness, body mass index and percent body fat were determined. As indices of body fat distribution, waist-hip ratio and subscapular triceps skin-fold ratio were calculated. As indices of fitness, physical activity level, determined by detailed questionnaire, and maximum 02 consumption were calculated. We tested whether the effect of age on glucose tolerance remains when data were adjusted for fatness, fitness, and fat distribution; 2-h glucose values were 6.61, 6.78, and 7.83 mM for young (17-39 yr), middle-aged (40-59 yr), and old (60-92 yr) men and 6.22, 6.22, and 7.28 mM for the three groups of women, respectively. The differences between the young and middle-aged groups were not significant, but the old groups had significantly higher values than young or middle-aged groups. Fatness, fitness, and fat distribution can account for the decline in glucose tolerance from the young adult to the middle-aged years. However, age remains a significant determinant of the further decline in glucose tolerance of healthy old subjects.\r"

Most individuals were receiving diet and/or drug therapy for diabetes. Subjects were separated into four groups based on World Health Organization criteria: nondiabetic control subjects, subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), patients with diabetes, and patients with other disorders without IGT. The overlap of AG values between each group was less than that of HbA1c or FA values. AG levels were significantly correlated with fasting plasma glucose (r = -0.627), HbA1c (r = -0.629), and FA (r = -0.590) levels. If we took 14 micrograms/ml as the normal lower limit, AG level was highly specific (93.1%), and a decreased AG level indicated diabetes mellitus (84.2% sensitivity). According to the selectivity index (sensitivity value times specificity value), AG determinations were superior to both HbA1c and FA measurements for diabetes screening. When combinations of these tests were used, only AG and HbA1c together were slightly better than AG alone. Thus, together with other advantages of AG, e.g., its wide variance with relatively fair glycemic control and the negligible influence of the sampling conditions, AG level has more potential than HbA1c or FA level as a screening criterion for diabetes.\r"

In this study, we examined the effects of replacing complete medium in the absence or presence of insulin on the regulation of insulin-receptor gene expression in cultured human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Failure to replace complete medium resulted in growth arrest of HepG2 cells and a six- to sevenfold increase in insulin-receptor mRNA due to the prolongation of insulin-receptor mRNA half-life. Northern analysis revealed multiple insulin-receptor mRNA species; the largest species (11 kilobases) was disproportionately increased in growth-arrested cells. High concentrations of insulin (500 ng/ml) induced a 33.8% decrease in the abundance of insulin-receptor mRNA (n = 14). At lower concentrations, a trend of inhibition was observed but was not statistically significant. Insulin (500 ng/ml) did not affect insulin-receptor mRNA stability. The effect of conditioned media, insulin, and dexamethasone on insulin-receptor promoter activity was also examined. Various constructs of the 5'-flanking region of the insulin-receptor gene were attached immediately upstream to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and transiently transfected into HepG2 cells via a pBR322-derived plasmid (pCAT). In cells replaced with complete medium, 12 and 118% of the promoter activity was contained within 578 and 877 base pairs, respectively, from the major translational initiation site. Conditioned media from growth-arrested cells in culture for 7 days increased promoter activity approximately twofold in 48 h. However, this increase failed to localize to any specific region on the insulin-receptor promoter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the early events in insulin signal transmission in liver, isolated rat hepatocytes were labeled with 32P, and proteins phosphorylated in response to insulin were detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-receptor antibodies and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In these cells, insulin rapidly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the 95,000-Mr beta-subunit of the insulin receptor and a 175,000-Mr phosphoprotein (pp175). Both proteins were precipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, whereas only the insulin receptor was recognized with anti-insulin-receptor antibody. In the insulin-stimulated state, both pp175 and the receptor beta-subunit were found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine residues. Based on precipitation by the two antibodies, receptor phosphorylation was biphasic with an initial increase in tyrosine phosphorylation followed by a more gradual increase in serine phosphorylation over the first 30 min of stimulation. The time course of phosphorylation of pp175 was rapid and paralleled that of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor. The pp175 was clearly distinguished from the insulin receptor, because it was detected only when boiling SDS was used to extract cellular phosphoproteins, whereas the insulin receptor was extracted with either Triton X-100 or SDS. In addition, the tryptic peptide maps of the two proteins were distinct. The dose-response curve for insulin stimulation was shifted slightly to the left of the insulin receptor, suggesting some signal amplification at this step. These data suggest that pp175 is a major endogenous substrate of the insulin receptor in liver and may be a cytoskeletal-associated protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thus, on the 1st day of infusion with 40% glucose, the islets responded to 16.7 mM glucose with a 3.9-fold increase in insulin release during the first 10 min with no significant change during the second-phase insulin output compared with the control group. On the 2nd day, there was a 2-fold enhancement of insulin release during the initial 10 min of stimulation, the second phase being a similar to control islets. On the 5th day of infusion, the pattern of insulin release was not significantly different from the control group. After 7 day of infusion, there was a 46% decrease in first-phase and a 33% decrease in second-phase insulin response to glucose. The response to 10 mM arginine plus 5 mM glucose was not modified by chronic glucose infusion. Priming experiments indicate that islets from rats infused for 7 days were not able to recover the normal pattern of secretion in vitro. Islets from 7-day glucose-infused rats contained 75% more protein and had a significantly higher insulin content than control islet, suggesting that insulin synthesis is not involved in the loss of the response observed. Glucose metabolism by the islets was modified by glucose infusion with a significant increase in glucose utilization and no changes in glucose oxidation, suggesting that alterations in mitochondrial oxidative events are involved in the phenomenon of desensitization.\r"

To determine the contribution of hepatic glucose cycling (defined as the net effect of glucose/glucose-6-phosphate cycling and uptake and release of glucose from hepatic glycogen) to postprandial hyperglycemia, diabetic, glucose-intolerant, and nondiabetic subjects were fed mixed meals. The meal contained both [2-3H]glucose (an isotope that is extensively detritiated during hepatic glucose cycling) and [6-3H]glucose (an isotope that is not detritiated during hepatic glucose cycling). Of the 50 g of carbohydrate contained in the meal, approximately 4-8 g underwent hepatic glucose cycling. Although total cycling of ingested glucose did not differ between diabetic, glucose-intolerant, and nondiabetic subjects (361 +/- 67 vs. 494 +/- 106 vs. 322 +/- 44 mumol.kg-1.5 h-1, respectively), the data suggested that hepatic cycling was increased in the diabetic and glucose-intolerant individuals but not in the nondiabetic subjects during the first 2 h after eating. Hepatic cycling during the first 2 h after eating was correlated with the prevailing glucagon concentration (r = 0.6, P less than 0.01) and increased (P less than 0.05) as hepatic glucose release increased. Hepatic glucose cycling had a marked effect on the measurement of so-called initial splanchnic glucose uptake. Nevertheless, however measured, initial splanchnic glucose uptake was not decreased and, if anything, was increased in diabetic and glucose-intolerant patients. Integrated postprandial hepatic glucose release increased (r less than 0.01) with the severity of fasting hyperglycemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of a diabetogenic diet on blood glucose and insulin levels, insulin sensitivity, and weight were evaluated in F1 and both (BL/6 X A/J) F1 X BL/6 and (BL/6 X A/J) F1 X A/J backcross mice. These results suggest that diet-induced hyperglycemia is largely determined by a recessive gene and diet-induced insulin resistance by a dominant gene. Analyses of both backcrosses indicated that insulin sensitivity and blood glucose levels were unrelated, suggesting that they are controlled by different genetic factors. This conclusion was supported by data from nine recombinant inbred BXA strains in which no correlation was observed between these variables. Furthermore, insulin sensitivity and body weight correlated differently in the two backcross groups, suggesting that insulin resistance is not simply a function of obesity. The number of genes that predominantly influence diabetic traits was estimated by comparing the variance observed in (BL/6 X A/J) F1 X BL/6 backcross mice with that observed in parental mice. The data suggest that relatively few genes predominantly affect the diabetic phenotype in this murine model.\r"

Family physicians at the perinatal referral centers performed significantly more artificial rupture of membranes, epidural blocks, augmentations of labor, and episiotomies on their low-risk patients than did those at the low-risk hospital. This trend was also found for obstetricians but did not reach statistical significance. Thus, the conclusion was drawn that caring for low-risk patients in a high-risk care environment is associated with a higher intervention rate by family physicians. Factors that may contribute to this finding are discussed.\r"

Yet further development of COPC practice within family practice has been hampered by difficulties in defining a target population that can be addressed in the variety of practice settings typical of family practice. This paper describes the application within a residency practice of the principles of COPC to the practice population, consisting of all members of the households of active patients. The results suggest that this approach is feasible, applicable in virtually any practice setting, and likely to reveal a large number of health and health care problems that can be remedied but that might otherwise have been unnoticed. The implications of this approach to COPC on the practice and training of family physicians are discussed.\r"

However, cocaine could also bring on headaches after several hours, both in chronic headache sufferers and in those not subject to headaches. The facts that cocaine may relieve headache immediately, and also may precipitate headaches several hours after use, suggests that the well-known vasoconstrictive actions of cocaine may be responsible. Migraineurs seem more susceptible to some of these effects of cocaine than are people without chronic headaches.\r"

The finding of a female preponderance, like that in chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, is a new observation. HC is, in general, a unilateral headache in the sense that it sets in on one side and subsequently sticks to this side. In two cases, both sides might possibly be involved, when the pain was at its maximum. In another (somewhat dubious) case the headache was bilateral. The pain was continuous from the beginning in 8 of 18 cases (early stage ratio continuous: non-continuous = 0.8). Over time, the headache developed a continuous character in 16 of the 18 cases, producing a \"continuous: non-continuous ratio\" of 8:1. The intensity of pain generally was moderate and was not reported as excruciatingly severe by any patient. The autonomic involvement from a clinical point of view, was clearly less pronounced than that of other unilateral headaches, such as cluster headache and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania.\r"

All subjects submitted to two 30-minute sessions of quiet monitoring, and for the headache subjects, one of the sessions was headache active. A bogus, but convincing preliminary \"assessment\" revealed insufficient headache activity in the headache active session, forcing subjects to reschedule that session in the future when a strong headache was present. A parallel manipulation was employed with the normal subjects. A MANOVA failed to discriminate within- or between-group differences on the psychophysiological measures. Self-reported pain was uncorrelated with the psychophysiological indices. These results cast further doubt on the validity of the psychophysiological measures employed in this study, the same ones routinely endorsed by headache researchers and therapists. We discuss problems of recruitment, compliance, and attrition in basic headache research.\r"

No differences were found between tension headache subjects (N = 43) and headache-free controls. While only an initial exploration of the importance of family characteristics in chronic headache, these results suggest that there are important differences in headache subjects' (particularly migraine) reports of family environment and functioning.\r"

The following were evaluated: anthropometric data, alcohol intake in grams per day, total body water, fat-free mass, fat mass, and body mass index (kg/m2). Two methods of measurement were used: skin fold thickness evaluation, and bioelectric impedance assay (BIA). BIA is a non-invasive method based on the principle that lean tissues conduct a low frequency alternating current of electricity better than do fatty tissues. Body mass index was increased in the alcohol-induced migraine patients (p less than 0.04), as was fat mass, (p less than 0.03) as evaluated by skin fold measurements. Bioelectric impedance assay demonstrated a slight total body water increase in alcohol-induced migraine patients (p less than 0.07). Possibly, if this total body water increase was reflected at the neuronal level, the bioelectric properties of the migrainous brain may be altered, thus creating a hypothetical link with the phenomenon of spreading depression.\r"

The oldest patients were more highly symptomatic, were more likely to be in heart failure, had more multivessel disease and were more likely to undergo multivessel dilation. The immediate success rate of angioplasty was higher in the oldest patients (92.8% versus 82%) (p = 0.0003). The hospital mortality rate was also higher (6.2% versus 1.6%) (p less than 0.001). Long-term overall survival was high. However, long-term event-free survival was lowest in the oldest patients, and recurrent severe angina was particularly common. Thus, in very elderly patients, coronary angioplasty is usually successful, but extra caution is warranted; also, long-term relief from angina is less common than in younger patients.\r"

However, the provocation of severe ischemia might potentially cause delayed recovery of myocardial function. To investigate the possibility that maximal exercise testing could induce prolonged impairment of left ventricular function, 15 patients with angiographically proved coronary disease and 9 age-matched control subjects with atypical chest pain and normal coronary arteries were studied. Radionuclide ventriculography was performed at rest, at peak exercise, during recovery and 2 and 7 days after exercise. Ejection fraction, peak filling and peak emptying rates and left ventricular wall motion were analyzed. All control subjects had a normal exercise test at maximal work loads and improved left ventricular function on exercise. Patients developed 1 mm ST depression at 217 +/- 161 s at a work load of 70 +/- 30 W and a rate-pressure product of 18,530 +/- 4,465 mm Hg x beats/min. Although exercise was discontinued when angina or equivalent symptoms occurred, in all patients diagnostic ST depression (greater than or equal to 1 mm) developed much earlier than symptoms. Predictably, at peak exercise patients showed a decrease in ejection fraction and peak emptying and filling rates. Ejection fraction and peak emptying rate normalized within the recovery period, whereas peak filling rate remained depressed throughout recovery (p less than 0.002) and was still reduced 2 days after exercise (p less than 0.02). In conclusion, in patients with severe impairement of coronary flow reserve, maximal exercise may cause sustained impairement of diastolic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This concept of a fixed threshold has recently been challenged. To evaluate the effects of varying exercise intensity on the ischemic threshold, 33 patients with coronary artery disease and provokable myocardial ischemia, documented by thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging, underwent two exercise tests 2 to 7 days apart. A symptom-limited incremental treadmill exercise test was followed by a 20 min submaximal treadmill test at an intensity approximating 70% of the peak heart rate attained during the incremental test. During the incremental exercise test, angina pectoris developed in 16 patients and 17 patients were asymptomatic. At least 0.1 mV of ST segment depression developed in all subjects during the incremental exercise test at a mean exercise duration of 5.3 +/- 2.6 min, a rate-pressure product of 19,130 +/- 5,735 and oxygen uptake of 19.6 +/- 7.0 ml/kg per min. During the submaximal exercise test, 28 (85%) of the 33 patients had significant ST segment depression. Of these patients, 24 (86%) were asymptomatic, including 10 patients who had previously reported anginal symptoms during the incremental test. The average time to onset of 0.1 mV ST segment depression during the submaximal test was 8.1 +/- 4.5 min. These changes occurred at a rate-pressure product of 15,250 +/- 3,705 and an oxygen uptake of 14.3 +/- 5.9 ml/kg per min, and were significantly (p less than 0.001) lower than values observed during the graded exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias was investigated by 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 49 hypertensive patients who had normal findings on coronary arteriography. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy was assessed by both ECG and echocardiography. The frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias were significantly related to the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy whether it was defined by wall thickness (interventricular septum or posterior wall greater than or equal to 1.2 cm) or by left ventricular mass indexed to height (left ventricular mass/height greater than or equal to 163 g/m in men and greater than or equal to 121 g/m in women). The relation between left ventricular mass or wall thickness to ventricular arrhythmia was graded and continuous; for every 1 mm increase in the thickness of interventricular septum or posterior wall there was an associated two- to threefold increase, respectively, in the occurrence and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias. In conclusion, left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias in the absence of coronary artery disease, and the relation is graded and continuous.\r"

Forty-nine patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who were taking a variety of antiarrhythmic medications including the class IC agents propafenone and flecainide were followed up for a median of 371 days with use of transtelephonic electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring to document symptomatic rhythms. Eighteen patients had 96 episodes of regular tachycardia; the cumulative incidence rate was 25% at 6 months, 33% at 1 year and 41% at 18 months. Eighty of the 96 episodes occurred with a heart rate less than or equal to 180 beats/min and could have been explained by atrial flutter with 2:1 block. However, nine patients had a total of 16 episodes with a rate greater than 180 beats/min that were probably not due to atrial flutter with block; the cumulative incidence rate of these fast regular tachycardias was 14% at 6 months, 17% at 1 year and 25% at 18 months. QRS duration during the first episode of regular tachycardia was significantly longer in patients taking a class IC drug (median 105 vs 90 ms, p less than 0.001 Wilcoxon rank sum test). In contrast to drug therapy with amiodarone or the combination of digoxin and verapamil, the QRS duration of regular tachycardias during class IC therapy was directly related to the tachycardia heart rate (Spearman's rank, p less than 0.01). All episodes of fast, regular tachycardias with a QRS duration greater than 120 ms occurred in patients taking a class IC drug. Clinicians treating patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation should expect a substantial incidence of regular tachycardia in addition to atrial fibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine is an endogenously produced compound that has significant effects as a coronary and systemic vasodilator. Previous studies suggest that intravenous infusion of adenosine, coupled with thallium-201 scintigraphy, may have specific value as a noninvasive means of evaluating coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of adenosine thallium testing with that of standard exercise thallium testing. One hundred subjects were studied with exercise thallium imaging and thallium imaging after adenosine infusion, including 47 with angiographically proved coronary artery disease and 53 control subjects. The overall sensitivity of the thallium procedures was 81% for the exercise study and 83% for the adenosine study (p = NS); the specificity was 74% for the exercise study and 75% for the adenosine study (p = NS). The diagnostic accuracy of the exercise study was 77% and that of the adenosine study was 79%. Ninety-four percent of subjects had an adverse effect due to the adenosine infusion; however, most of these effects were mild and well tolerated. All adverse effects abated within 30 to 45 s of the termination of the study, consistent with the very brief half-life of the agent. Thus, thallium-201 scintigraphy after intravenous infusion of adenosine has a diagnostic value similar to that of exercise thallium testing for evaluation of coronary artery disease. Adenosine thallium testing may be particularly useful in evaluating patients unable to perform treadmill exercise testing.\r"

To determine the feasibility of Tc-99m teboroxime imaging in the diagnosis of patients with suspected coronary artery disease, 30 patients underwent single photon emission computed tomography imaging with Tc-99m teboroxime (25.2 +/- 1 mCi) at peak exercise and again 60 min later at rest. All patients underwent either a thallium stress test (n = 26) or automated quantitative coronary arteriography (n = 25), or both, without intervening revascularization or infarction. Images were reviewed by two investigators who had no knowledge of clinical data. Coronary lesions with greater than or equal to 50% diameter narrowing by quantitative coronary arteriography were considered significant. Both thallium and Tc-99m teboroxime detected disease in all patients with two or three vessel disease. One vessel disease was detected with Tc-99m teboroxime in 9 of 10 patients and with thallium in 8 of 10 (p = NS). In patients without angiographically significant disease. Tc-99m teboroxime demonstrated normal perfusion in six of eight patients and thallium in three of five (p = NS). Overall, when presence or absence of disease detected by Tc-99m teboroxime or thallium was compared with quantitative coronary arteriography, there was no difference between Tc-99m teboroxime and thallium. These results suggest that Tc-99m teboroxime is comparable to thallium as an imaging agent. The rapid biologic half-life, 5.3 min, allows studies to be completed in 60 to 90 min.\r"

Primary coronary angioplasty was performed in 22 patients and successful intravenous thrombolytic therapy was given to 15 patients, both within 6 h of the onset of chest pain. Patency of the infarct-related artery was confirmed by angiography in all 37 patients. In the remaining six patients (three with and three without early thrombolytic therapy) the infarct-related artery remained occluded. Single photon emission computed tomography was performed within 6 h of the administration of technetium-99m isonitrile and repeated at the time of hospital discharge. Radionuclide ejection fraction at discharge was significantly lower for patients with anterior infarction (0.41 +/- 0.12) than for those with inferior infarction (0.56 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.001). Early perfusion defect size, a measure of myocardium at risk, was greater in patients with anterior than in those with inferior infarction (52 +/- 9% vs. 18 +/- 10% of the left ventricle, p = 0.0001) as was final defect size (30 +/- 20% vs. 9 +/- 8%, p less than 0.01). The change in myocardial perfusion, an estimate of myocardial salvage, was also greater in patients with anterior infarction (24 +/- 16% vs. 10 +/- 7%, p less than 0.01). However, the proportion of jeopardized myocardium salvaged (salvage index) was not significantly different between patients with anterior or inferior infarction (0.49 +/- 0.34 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.35, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a new approach to interpretation could improve the accuracy of thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of left anterior descending coronary artery disease in patients with left bundle branch block, 69 patients were evaluated. Forty-four had angiographically proved coronary artery disease; the remaining 25 were considered to have a \"low\" (mean 13.5 +/- 6.4%, range 3.4% to 24.9%) likelihood of disease before thallium-201 scintigraphy. The conventional scintigraphic criterion for detection of left anterior descending artery disease (septal, anterior or apical defects) was compared with a new criterion that required the apex to be abnormal to indicate left anterior descending disease. The normalcy rates in the low likelihood patient group were significantly improved by using the new approach, from 16% to 80% (p less than 0.0001) by visual analysis and from 24% to 64% (p = 0.003) by quantitative SPECT polar map analysis. The sensitivity for left anterior descending disease was similar for the conventional and the new method by visual (100% vs. 94%) and quantitative (100% vs. 83%) analyses. In contrast, the specificity was significantly improved by using the new approach, from 14% to 79% (p = 0.0006) by visual analysis and 14% to 64% (p = 0.007) by quantitative analysis. In conclusion, septal and anterior thallium-201 SPECT defects are common in patients with left bundle branch block without coronary artery disease, resulting in low specificity for left anterior descending artery disease. The normalcy rates and accuracy for detection of left anterior descending coronary artery disease were significantly better when an apical defect was used as the criterion for disease.\r"

Measurements were made at the same time on 5 to 6 sequential days from an apical window with use of both continuous wave and pulsed wave Doppler techniques. Two statistical measures of reliability were calculated, the intraclass coefficient of correlation (R), which varies between 0 (null reliability) and +1 (perfect reliability), and the 95% confidence interval for the error-free value of a single measurement. For sequential measurements of arterial pressure, 24 h urinary volume and sodium excretion and body weight, the intraclass coefficients of correlation ranged from 0.85 to 0.99, indicating low day to day variability consistent with tight environmental control. Continuous and pulsed wave modes were proved equally and highly reliable for measuring minute distance of aortic flow. However, continuous wave Doppler ultrasound provided acceptable signals more frequently than did the pulsed wave technique. For continuous wave Doppler ultrasound, R was 0.87 (p less than 0.00001); the 95% confidence interval was +/- 1.81 m/min (or 11% of the mean of all measurements), which indicates that this method can be used in a single individual to detect a greater than 11% change in minute distance measured once before and after an intervention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Gas exchange data were collected continuously during each of the following protocols, performed on separate days in randomized order: Bruce, Balke and an individualized ramp treadmill; 25 W/stage, 50 W/stage and an individualized ramp cycle ergometer test. Maximal oxygen uptake was 16% greater on the treadmill protocols combined (21.4 +/- 8 ml/kg per min) versus the cycle ergometer protocols combined (18.1 +/- 7 ml/kg per min) (p less than 0.01), although no differences were observed in maximal heart rate (131 +/- 24 versus 126 +/- 24 beats/min for the treadmill and cycle ergometer protocols, respectively). No major differences were observed in maximal heart rate or maximal oxygen uptake among the various treadmill protocols or among the various cycle ergometer protocols.

Eighteen specimens were differentially stained by a newly developed method that precisely determines relative collagen content; these tissues were compared with postmortem hypertrophied and normal control subaortic specimens. Quantitation revealed a 72% higher level (36.5 vs. 22.1 micrograms collagen/mg protein) of stainable collagen in the hearts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in hypertrophied control hearts. The endocardial plaque was quantitated morphometrically, and it constituted only 4.6 +/- 1.7% of the total increased collagen content in the cardiomyopathy specimens. For the matrix studies, the cardiomyopathy specimens were stained by a silver impregnation technique that identifies connective tissue elements not normally visible with routine histologic methods. There was a marked increase in content of all matrix components, both in areas of pathologic scarring and in \"normal\" zones. Whorls of matrix connective tissue were noted in regions of myocyte whorls, as well as independent of them. Thus, these studies revealed a striking increase of both scar-type and matrix connective tissue in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The extensive scarring and the pronounced interstitial and intercellular matrix connective tissue may contribute to the increased ventricular chamber stiffness and impaired relaxation in this disease.\r"

Atrial fibrillation had occurred spontaneously in 31 (54%) of the 57 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and in 1 (3%) of the 33 with a concealed accessory pathway (p less than 0.001). Sustained atrial fibrillation was induced in 23 of 31 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and spontaneous atrial fibrillation (Group A), in 7 of 26 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome without spontaneous atrial fibrillation (Group B) and in 5 of 33 patients with a concealed accessory pathway (Group C). The anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway was shorter in Group A than in Group B (252 versus 297 ms, p less than 0.001). There were no differences among groups in PA interval, right to left atrium conduction time, cycle length of tachycardia and atrial and retrograde accessory pathway effective refractory period. Atrial fibrillation is more frequent in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome than in those with a concealed accessory pathway. Patients with overt pre-excitation and atrial fibrillation have a shorter anterograde accessory pathway refractory period. It seems therefore that the anterograde rather than the retrograde conduction properties of the accessory pathway are the critical determinants of atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\r"

The other 26 fetuses had normal cardiac anatomy; in 19 cases the mother had connective tissue disease or tested positive for antinuclear antibodies. Six fetuses showed progression from sinus rhythm or second degree block to complete AV block. Of the 55 pregnancies, 5 were terminated and 24 fetuses or neonates died; at the end of the neonatal period 26 fetuses were still alive. Fetal or neonatal death correlated significantly with the presence of structural heart defects (4 of 29 surviving, p less than 0.001), hydrops (0 of 22 surviving, p less than 0.001), an atrial rate less than or equal to 120 beats/min (1 of 12 surviving, p less than 0.005) or a ventricular rate less than or equal to 55 beats/min (3 of 21 surviving, p less than 0.001).
