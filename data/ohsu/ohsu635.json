The ratio of KS to KA can be used as an indicator of the intensity of the selective constraints on the amino acid sequence of a protein. By this approach we have shown that for both gp120 and gp41, the rate of change in amino acid sequence relative to the overall rate of change in nucleotide sequence is higher than for any other protein yet analyzed. The gag proteins p15 and p17 evolve slightly less rapidly, but p24 is relatively strongly conserved. We have compared the env gene of HIV with those of two other retroviruses for which appropriate data are available. In neither murine leukemia virus nor feline leukemia virus do the envelope glycoproteins evolve particularly rapidly. These results suggest that HIV is unusual among retroviruses in that both gp120 and gp41 are evolving under extremely weak selective constraints relative to the rest of the viral genome; accordingly, much of the observed variation may be selectively neutral.\r"

It encodes besides the gag, pol, and env genes several novel genes (S1 and bel 1, 2, and 3) that are comparable to the regulatory genes R, X, tat, art, and 3'-orf of the human (HIVs) and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) with respect to genomic location and to sizes of the putative gene products. A comparison between the HIV protein sequences of the pol and the novel genes to the corresponding gene product sequences of HSRV revealed that HSRV is related to the lentiviruses but occupies a distinct phylogenetic placement of its own. A detailed analysis of the reverse transcriptase domain allows the construction of a phylogenetic tree for the known retroviral subfamilies and/or groups, including the oncoviruses, the lentiviruses, the spumaviruses, the HLTV-BLV group, and the D-type viruses. Regions of the putative novel HSRV gene products with segmental protein sequence homology to the regulatory protein of other human retroviruses are discussed. The results strengthen the view that HSRV and its novel genes should be studied in comparison to the new genes of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) viruses and human T cell leukemia viruses (HTLV).\r"

Cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes from these patients formed multinucleated giant cells and reacted with sera and monoclonal antibodies to HTLV-1 in a manner identical to adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) patient lymphocytes. Western blot analysis failed to reveal any marked difference in the antigens recognized by sera from TSP and ATLL patients. The sera from TSP patients, their asymptomatic relatives and ATLL patients were titrated using the following assays: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), particle agglutination, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and pseudotype neutralization. There were significantly stronger serologic responses in the TSP patients than in their relatives or ATLL patients. High antibody titers in the presence of replicating virus often reflect the antigen load; however, these data are also consistent with the suggestion that neurologic damage in TSP may be immunologically mediated.\r"

The women had worked as prostitutes for an average of 5 years; one-fourth serviced foreign visitors exclusively, mainly sailors. Only 4 women used condoms, and only 1 woman gave a history of parenteral narcotic abuse, although 53% were regularly exposed to unsterile needles outside the medical setting for injections of vitamins, antibiotics, or steroids; another 29% are thought to probably use unsterile needles. None of the 140 prostitutes screened was seropositive for HIV, despite a very high prevalence of antibody to T. pallidum (24%), C. trachomatis (97%), HSV I and II (100%), and hepatitis B (51%); 5% were HbsAg positive. These data indicate that HIV has not yet been introduced into female prostitutes in the Peruvian port city. We believe that widespread use of unsterile needles in developing countries, such as Peru, represents a serious health threat and will amplify the spread of HIV, once introduced.\r"

First, calcification has not been a major problem because of the relatively short implant durations (less than 5 years). The second observation was that thromboembolism was found to be practically nonexistent. The third observation was that the leaflets of certain valves that had been removed showed leaflet stretching, which resulted in excess stress in certain loci of the leaflet. The studies reported here showed that the bovine pericardial sac was distensible to various degrees. Strips from various sections of pericardium had a large spectrum of strain (5-45%), at very small stress levels (less than or equal to 4 g/mm2). Further, within any section the material was anisotropic, with strain differences of 25%. Finally, histologic studies of clinical grade Ionescu-Shiley bovine pericardial valves showed marked discrepancies in structure and staining characteristics, further documenting that this material is not homogeneous. New methods of tissue selection are mandatory and have been designed to improve uniformity and ultimately reduce the viability in performance in the clinical setting. This method can be applied to all pericardial valves.\r"

  ".W": "Several preimplantation processes have been shown to inhibit the calcification of pieces of porcine aortic valves and of bovine parietal pericardium implanted subcutaneously in rats. To investigate the effectiveness of these processes in modifying the calcification of bioprosthetic valves implanted in an intracardiac position, mitral and tricuspid valve replacements were performed in young sheep. Bioprosthetic valves treated with the following preimplantation processes were studied: 1) surfactants, including sodium dodecyl sulfate, polysorbate-80, Triton X-100 and N-lauryl sarcosine; 2) covalently bound aminohydroxypropane diphosphonic acid; 3) toluidine blue; and 4) incorporation of polyacrylamide into valvular tissues. Quantitative calcium analyses showed that only the surfactants substantially reduced calcification of bioprostheses implanted in intracardiac positions. This effect was evident only in porcine aortic valvular bioprostheses, and not in pericardial bioprostheses. Triton X-100 and N-lauryl sarcosine not only reduced calcification but also induced alterations that decreased the durability of the valves. Toluidine blue decreased calcification to a degree that was statistically significant but not biologically important, while polyacrylamide incorporation and diphosphonate binding increased calcification. Thus, data regarding anticalcification treatments obtained from subcutaneous implantation studies in small animal models should be interpreted cautiously and validated by studies with intracardiac valvular implantation in large animals.\r"

The valve is examined from three aspects: hemodynamics, thromboembolism, and durability. The hemodynamic performance of the porcine bioprosthetic heart valve reveals that it performs as well as the Hall-Medtronic valve, better than the Starr-Edwards valve, but not as well as the St. Jude valve. The main reason for using the bioprosthetic heart valve is to decrease thromboembolism or avoid anticoagulation. The author concludes that evidence appears to support that with bioprosthetic heart valves the incidence of thromboembolism is indistinguishable from the best mechanical heart valves, with the difference being that patients with bioprosthetic valves do not need to be anticoagulated. In our experience with durability at 15 years, freedom from primary tissue failure with the porcine bioprosthetic heart valve is 41% for all valves, 44.8% for the aortic valves, and 40.8% for the mitral valve. After 15 years experience with the porcine bioprosthetic heart valve its main limitation is its lack of durability and therefore currently is used for selected indications.\r"

L. Gore and Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ) placed in the carotid arteries of normal baboons. Platelet deposition plateaued over 2 hr postoperatively and occurred primarily at the graft-vessel anastomoses. A positive correlation was found between the circulating platelet count in individual animals and the extent of early platelet thrombus deposition. Unmodified ePTFE grafts accumulated 4.6 +/- 1.2 x 10(9) platelets per graft, or 2.3 +/- 0.71 x 10(9) platelets per anastomosis. Acutely, platelet accumulation was reduced versus control graft results by coating the graft lumenal surfaces with a smooth layer of silicone rubber polymer (0.60 +/- 0.19 x 10(9) platelets per anastomosis; P less than 0.02) but not by coating the grafts using a plasma polymer based on methane, which did not modify graft texture (8.2 +/- 1.7 x 10(9) platelets per graft; P greater than 0.10). The benefit of the silicone rubber coating persisted for at least 48 hr. However, longer term patency was not preserved because 10 of 12 grafts placed had failed within 1 to 2 months.\r"

Excellent immediate function was observed universally allowing catheter use for dialysis and good skin-device interface; however dialysate leakage occurred within 2 to 4 weeks in four patients. Lack of permanent bonding between the catheter and the adjustable proximal cuff, resulting in suboptimal or slow ingrowth of tissue around it, appears to be the cause of this phenomenon.\r"

Higher plasma filter sieving coefficients for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were obtained from healthy volunteers, suggesting that in hypercholesterolemic patients the LDL fraction has a larger mean particle size. The difference in plasma filter sieving coefficients for apoprotein B and LDL cholesterol indicates a large heterogeneity in LDL particle sizes. The HDL cholesterol post treatment concentration decreased an average of 30% compared with the pretreatment concentration. However, because the total drop in cholesterol concentration was about 60%, the ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol improved substantially. Removal of LDL and total cholesterol closely approximated the theoretic 100% removal line representing plasma exchange, and a high return of HDL cholesterol was achieved. The simple kinetic model can be used for treatment planning (calculation of plasma volume to be processed) to achieve the desired post treatment macrosolute concentrations.\r"

The authors manufactured a new hybrid artificial liver containing hepatocyte monolayers and evaluated its function. Hepatocytes isolated from an adult dog liver were cultured on collagen coated borosilicated glass (10 X 20 X 0.04 cm). A long-stroke artificial liver module was constructed by stacking 200 glass plates bearing hepatocytes, which were viable and functioned well during 4 weeks in perfusion culture; glyconeogenesis = 110 ng/micrograms DNA/min, urea synthesis = 3.6 ng/micrograms DNA/min and albumin synthesis = 29 micrograms/10(6) cells/day at the 5th day of perfusion. The levels were maintained for 2 weeks. The new device was applied to anhepatic dogs (Group 3) and compared with untreated (Group 1) and plasma exchange dogs (Group 2). The survival times were 21.3 +/- 5.6 hours in Group 1 (N = 6), 27.8 +/- 4.0 hours in Group 2 (N = 3), and 55.0 +/- 10.3 hours in Group 3 (N = 4). The longest survival was 65 hours. Serum ammonia increased to over 2,000 micrograms/dl after 12 hours in Groups 1 and 2, but remained under 400 micrograms/dl in Group 3. This new type of hybrid system may be a pilot design for the complete artificial liver.\r"

The basic requirements for high-quality 3D reformations are an absence of patient movement and narrow-width transaxial sections. Speed of examination is an important factor in optimizing image quality. One hundred examinations were performed on an IGE CT 9800 scanner. For bone studies, 80 mAs and, for certain soft tissues, 140 or 200 mAs were employed with 120 kVp. The advantages of such a \"low-dose\" technique are significant reduction in patient skin dose and a faster examination. The main disadvantage is a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio. The image quality obtained in 3D presentations has nevertheless been sufficient to enable all bony abnormalities to be identified. Three-dimensional examinations are now being performed routinely using a dynamic mode and this \"low-dose\" technique.\r"

During a selected 2-week period, 84% and 76% of all examinations performed on Accident and Emergency patients and inpatients, respectively, were found to be normal. Previous reports suggest that the number of radiographs requested in the Accident and Emergency department can be reduced without detriment to patients by the implementation of appropriate clinical guidelines. We consider that if similar guidelines were developed and applied to the use of out-of-hours radiography, substantial savings could be made. We estimate that in our hospital these savings could amount to 18% of the current expenditure on this service.\r"

Cytogenetic analysis of the damage in irradiated V79 cells gave an RBE of 6.7 +/- 1.4. Irradiation in a polyethylene phantom markedly attenuated the beam's biological effect. For both cell lines 2 cm of polyethylene virtually eliminated cell killing. Addition of boron 10 to the medium led to increased cell killing and a value of 4 was obtained for the RBE of the 10B(n, alpha)7Li reaction in HeLa cells.\r"

The induction of chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes in vitro was examined and a linear dose effect with a relative biological effectiveness similar to fission neutrons was obtained. For samples placed at depths in a plastic phantom the aberration yields declined with depth at a rate matching the fall in the sum of dose due to proton recoils and neutron capture in nitrogen 14. The presence of boron 10 at 30 micrograms ml-1 did not affect the aberration yield. By using the mixed sample method, the probability of interphase death or mitotic delay in cells crossed by an alpha particle or lithium-7 ion produced in the boron capture reaction was shown to be close to 1.0. Thus these cells are prevented from coming to mitosis in culture. The implications for boron capture therapy are that this filtered beam has a \"high LET\" effect which could lead to poor normal tissue sparing. However there may be a significant therapeutic advantage due to a high probability of killing tumour cells that have incorporated boron 10.\r"

The response of the cells to 24 keV neutrons was predicted satisfactorily by the LET distribution, in spite of the fact that the maximum range of the recoil protons is only 0.5 micron.

For the application of such beams to boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) these calculations show the superiority of 2 keV neutrons over 24 keV neutrons and the importance of using large-area beams. A 24 keV neutron beam has been used to irradiate HeLa cell cultures in vitro, with and without the addition of 10B, at various depths within a narrow polyethylene phantom. Survival data obtained from these experiments have been used to estimate depth-damage profiles for normal (unboronated) and tumour (boronated) brain tissues when exposed to 24 keV neutrons. A good differential between damage to normal and tumorous tissue is obtained under suitable irradiation conditions. Although lower-energy neutrons are probably preferable, these results demonstrate the possibility of using beams of 24 keV neutrons for the BNCT of brain tumours.\r"

  ".W": "A new two-tumour system has been developed to examine the effect of an angiogenic stimulus on the tumour bed effect (TBE) in C3H mouse skin treated with 20 Gy X rays. The first tumour was implanted intradermally to stimulate angiogenesis. The Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) was used for this since it is isogeneic in C57 B1 mice and after initial growth (mean volume 69 mm3), tumours completely regressed within 24 days. The second tumour, the RIF-1 fibrosarcoma (RIF) isogeneic to C3H mice was used to assess stromal function using the TBE assay. After complete regression of the 3LL tumour, RIF cells were implanted into the centre of the stimulated sites and 24 days later the resulting RIF tumours were excised and the TBE measured from the yield of viable RIF cells obtained from each tumour. There was an approximately 10-fold increase in cell yield from tumours implanted into stimulated, pre-irradiated beds compared with those implanted into unstimulated, pre-irradiated beds. This suggests that the angiogenic stimulus provided by the growth of the 3LL tumour led to a substantial restoration of the capacity of the radiation-damaged stroma to support tumour growth. If stromal restoration, as seen during these experiments using artificially induced angiogenesis, was to occur in unstimulated stroma during the normal course of repair and regeneration, this slowly dividing tissue constituent might eventually recover given sufficient time. This raises the possibility that the role of the stroma in late radiation damage might not be as important as was previously thought.\r"

  ".W": "This report analyses the changes in the classification of the genitourinary tumours introduced by the 1987 edition of the TNM system. Criticism and suggestions for improvement are given. These are based on the extensive experience of the EORTC GU Group with clinical trial work particularly the identification of prognostic factors, on their success in reaching international consensus on tumour classification, and on information from the literature. Many of the changes introduced in the 1987 system are not considered to be strictly necessary. These include the introduction of the new additional descriptors, including \"C\" and \"R\", the changes in the T classification of prostatic and renal cancer, and the introduction of uniform N categories for all tumours and other features. We regret the omission of minimal requirements, the omission of the V classification for macroscopic or microscopic vascular invasion, the changes in the T categories of carcinoma of the bladder and the introduction of stage groupings for all urological tumours. Some of these changes are considered unacceptable. The attitude of the EORTC GU Group toward the use of the new TNM classification is indicated in detail.\r"

Of the 25 patients available for analysis, 20% developed immediate surgical complications, 20% had residual post-operative stone and 33% developed true ipsilateral stone recurrence during the period of follow-up. Our results from partial nephrectomy for calculus disease are compared with the results of treatment by percutaneous nephrolithotomy and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. It was concluded that partial nephrectomy should be reserved for situations where stone disease is associated with anatomical abnormalities which cannot be treated by the newer modalities of stone management.\r"

About 30 clinically affected patients have been reported in the literature. APRT deficiency is an enzyme disorder which is inherited autosomally in a recessive manner. The use of adenine in purine metabolism is disturbed and it accumulates in the body, where it is oxidised to poorly insoluble 2,8-dihydroxyadenine by xanthine oxidase. The dihydroxyadenine forms stones which can be mistaken for uric acid stones. Our patient had had frequent episodes of urolithiasis and the diagnosis was finally made after pyelolithotomy and stone analysis. The total APRT deficiency was detected in the haemolysate of erythrocytes. Partial deficiency of APRT in the patient's relatives showed heterozygosity of the enzyme defect. The only clinical manifestation of the defect is the formation of urinary stones. This can be prevented by diet and allopurinol.\r"

In order to assess whether there is an occult neuropathy associated with chronic retention, neurophysiological measurements were used to test the integrity of the lower urinary tract nerve supply. A series of 22 male patients with chronic urinary retention secondary to prostatic hyperplasia underwent sacral reflex latency measurement; 73% demonstrated a sensory suprasacral abnormality with intact spinal reflex arcs. These results suggest that although the sacral reflex pathways are intact, there is a sensory/proprioceptive abnormality in the higher neurological centres which may be an adaptive mechanism to the presence of bladder outflow obstruction.\r"

Delayed voiding was common immediately after surgery but voiding problems were not encountered once micturition had been re-established. Although a significant objective failure rate was demonstrated, the Stamey procedure has many advantages and it can be recommended as first-line treatment in cases of stress incontinence.\r"

This ratio can differentiate hormonally treated patients with carcinoma of the prostate from those untreated and from those with benign prostatic hypertrophy. The specificity is increased for individuals by repeat samples. Comparison of samples before and after resection showed no loss of function and no difference was found between groups treated with orchiectomy or LHRH agonist (Zoladex). The VB3/VB1 zinc concentration could be used in a prospective study of hormonal treatments directed against the prostate, where it could give objective evidence of a fall in secretory function of the gland.\r"

In the corpus spongiosum, field stimulation evoked twitch-like contractions followed by relaxations. These relaxations were enhanced and prolonged by neostigmine and partly suppressed by atropine. Guanethidine abolished the twitch-like contractions and increased muscle tone. The relaxations observed after pre-treatment with guanethidine were abolished by tetrodotoxin (TTX), thereby indicating that these muscles are innervated by adrenergic excitatory, cholinergic and non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory nerves. In the helicine artery and bulbus glandis, field stimulation evoked contractions and these contractions were abolished by guanethidine or TTX, indicating that these muscles are innervated by adrenergic excitatory nerve fibres. After pre-treatment with guanethidine and atropine, muscle relaxation appeared in response to field stimulation in the helicine artery but not in the bulbus glandis, indicating that the helicine artery in the corpus spongiosum is also innervated by non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory nerves in addition to the excitatory adrenergic nerves. In the smooth muscle cells of the corpus spongiosum, slow potential changes were correlated with spontaneous contractions and field stimulation evoked excitatory or inhibitory junction potentials. The neural mechanism involved in erection is discussed in relation to the topical difference in the autonomic innervation patterns in the corpus spongiosum, helicine artery and bulbus glandis.\r"

In a study of 53 normal subjects we demonstrated this temperature gradient with a median temperature difference between the rectum and lower, mid and upper anal canal of 0.4, 0.2 and 0.1 degrees C respectively. The second condition was examined in 15 normal ambulatory subjects by measuring mid-anal sphincter (SP) and rectal pressures (RP) with a microtransducer catheter. The signals were digitalized and recorded in a portable electronic memory for later computer display, and analysis. Marked spontaneous sphincter relaxation resulting in equalization of RP and SP occurred 7 times per hour (1-4). The conscious sensation of the presence of flatus was associated with an SP reduction of 30 mmHg (20-50 mmHg) and an RP increase of 7 mmHg (0-15 mmHg), such that RP greater than or equal to SP in 80 per cent of 144 recorded events. Using this new technique we have demonstrated the highly dynamic nature of the anal sphincter. Several times an hour the sphincter relaxes with subsequent equalization of rectal and anal pressures, allowing entry of rectal contents into the anal canal so that its presence and nature can be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-three consecutive patients having restorative proctocolectomy since April 1986 were randomly allocated to reconstruction using a stapled J pouch (n = 18) or a sutured W pouch (n = 15). There were no deaths, but one patient required pouch excision for ischaemia (J). One patient developed a leak from the pouch necessitating loop ileostomy (J) and one patient had a low pouch vaginal fistula successfully treated by a seton (W). There were no other major complications. Median (range) operative time was 200 min (165-290) for J pouch and 255 min (220-330) for the W pouch (P less than 0.05). In 24 patients followed up for more than 4 months after restoring intestinal continuity, median frequency of defaecation over 24 h was 4 (3-6) for the J pouch and 4 (3-6) for the W pouch. There was no incontinence, urgency or soiling. These results indicate that the quicker J pouch provides identical functional results to the larger W pouch in this series of patients.\r"

After standard procedures, carried out by all grades of surgeons, the omentum was mobilized as a pedicle graft based on the left gastro-epiploic arcade and transposed to the pelvis or perineum. All wound were closed primarily without drainage. Twenty-six patients had anterior resection, 11 abdominoperineal resection and 3 an extended Hartmann's operation. Patients were assessed clinically and radiographically by Gastrografin enema and ultrasound for evidence of anastomotic leakage, pelvic collections and wound healing. After anterior resection there were three radiological leaks and no overt clinical leaks. One patient had a collection related to a leak. Of 11 perineal wound 8 healed primarily in 2 weeks and all healed by 4 weeks. There was no frank wound breakdown. The three patients who had Hartmann's operations all healed without complication. There were no unavoidable complications of the procedure. Retrocolic omentoplasty is a simple, safe and effective adjunct to rectal surgery. The additional time taken (15-20 min) is well rewarded by sound healing of these operations.\r"

Of 50 patients examined by colonoscopy, the whole colon was seen in only 21 (42 per cent) and almost half of these had a tumour in the caecum or ascending colon. In most cases, an incomplete examination was the result of narrowing of the lumen by the tumour preventing passage of the endoscope. Of 80 patients examined by double contrast barium enema, the entire length of the colon was visualized in 83 per cent but the quality of the examination was sufficient to confidently exclude synchronous neoplastic lesions in only 51 per cent. The incidence of synchronous cancer in this series was within the expected range, although two such cancers were not detected until laparotomy, but the incidence of synchronous adenomas was two-thirds of the expected number in colonoscopy patients and one-third in those examined by barium enema. It is concluded that, in patients with known colorectal cancer, preoperative investigation is unreliable for the detection of all synchronous neoplasia and that patients should have postoperative colonoscopy.\r"

A control group given no intestinal stimuli were studied to determine the frequency of spontaneous emptying during fasting (n = 18). 99mTc-EHIDA (2,6 diethylphenylcarbamoylmethyliminodiacetic acid) was used as the biliary tracer. The frequency of gallbladder emptying during fasting was 0.0045/min. Thus, in any 20 min period emptying occurred spontaneously in only about 1 in 11 volunteers. Significant emptying (greater than 5 per cent over 20 min) occurred in 8 out of 15 volunteers after sham feeding a sandwich (P less than 0.001 versus control), in 8 out of 15 volunteers after sham feeding a cooked meal (P = 1.0 versus sandwich sham feed, n.s.), in 6 out of 9 volunteers after gastric distension (P less than 0.001 versus control) and in 14 out of 14 volunteers after meal ingestion. The rate of emptying was significantly greater in the gastric distension and meal ingestion groups compared with other groups (P less than 0.05). However, the emptying rate after sham feeding was not significantly different from spontaneous gallbladder emptying (P greater than 0.05, n.s.). There was no significant difference in time to onset of emptying between the four stimulus groups (P greater than 0.05, n.s.). These results suggest that pre-duodenal stimuli can evoke gallbladder emptying in man, although the precise physiological significance of this phenomenon remains to be established.\r"

Urgent ERCP (less than 72 h) was performed in 68 cases and early ERCP (3-30 days) in 63 cases; 47 had predicted severe attacks and 84 had predicted mild attacks (modified Glasgow criteria). The highest incidence of common bile duct stones occurred in those with predicted severe attacks and those who had urgent ERCP. Highly significant correlations were found between age and common bile duct and pancreatic duct diameters. Significant correlations were also found between the common bile duct and pancreatic duct (correcting for age) and between these and the admission serum bilirubin. The common bile duct diameter was greatest in those with common bile duct stones and predicted severe attacks. A considerably lower incidence of pancreatic duct filling occurred in those with predicted severe attacks and common bile duct stones; in predicted mild attacks the pancreatic duct diameter was greater in those with common bile duct stones. In gallstone patients complications were highest in those with predicted severe attacks but more significantly in those with common bile duct stones. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was undertaken in 37 patients with common bile duct stones without mortality. The overall complication rate in gallstone patients was 19 per cent and the mortality rate was 2 per cent. These findings suggest that common bile duct stones cause acute common bile duct and pancreatic duct obstruction and are closely associated with complications. Urgent ERCP for detection of common bile duct stones, and endoscopic sphincterotomy for treatment, is strongly recommended for patients with predicted severe attacks due to gallstones and should also be considered for others who fail to show clinical improvement.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-four hour ambulatory intragastric pH (24 h IGpH) recording, a highly reproducible technique, was used to compare the effects of ranitidine and highly selective vagotomy (HSV) in 20 patients who had been referred for surgical treatment of duodenal ulcer. The 24 h IGpH was recorded when they were taking either placebo or ranitidine 300 mg at 10 pm, and again 4 to 13 weeks after elective HSV. Median 24 h IGpH and 24 h hydrogen ion activity (24 h [H+]) were calculated for each patient. Median (quartile) 24 h IGpH was 1.4 (1.3-1.6) with placebo, 2.2 (1.8-2.7) after ranitidine and 2.6 (1.8-3.7) after HSV. IGpH was significantly higher after both ranitidine (P less than 0.0001) and HSV (P less than 0.0001) than after placebo, but IGpH after ranitidine did not differ from IGpH after HSV (0.5 greater than P greater than 0.4). HSV reduced 24 h [H+] by a median 68 per cent (quartiles, 47-82 per cent) whereas ranitidine reduced it by only 50 per cent (34-69 per cent, 0.1 greater than P greater than 0.05). The 24 h pH recording was then analysed as two distinct periods; 'daytime' (8 am to midnight) and 'night-time' (midnight to 8 am). HSV reduced daytime [H+] by a median 77 per cent (59-93 per cent) whereas ranitidine reduced it by only 30 per cent (13-45 per cent, P less than 0.0001). HSV reduced night-time [H+] by a median 57 per cent (40-83 per cent) but ranitidine reduced it by a median 92 per cent (78-98 per cent, P less than 0.01). Thus, HSV inhibits gastric acidity more during the day than at night, whereas ranitidine given at 10 pm effectively suppresses night-time acidity but is much less effective in suppressing daytime acidity. However both HSV and ranitidine will heal more than 90 per cent of duodenal ulcers. Hence, contrary to Dragstedt's teaching, suppression of nocturnal acidity is not of crucial importance for the healing of duodenal ulcers.\r"

Glove perforation did not influence bacterial counts on the surgeons' hands or on the outside of their gloves. A separate clinical study of 100 adult hernia repairs gave no evidence that perforation increased wound sepsis. After standard pre-operative hand preparation, glove perforations are of no clinical significance to the patient, but their high incidence should alert surgeons to the need for protection against pathogens transmissible during surgery, such as hepatitis B and the human immunodeficiency virus. Protection of the surgeon is the main indication for preoperative change of damaged gloves.\r"

Following excision of a 3 cm2 disc of tissue from the liver, 42 rabbits were randomized to the use of gauze swabs (n = 6), oxidized cellulose (Surgicel) (n = 12), porcine collagen (Medistat) (n = 12) or calcium alginate (Kaltostat) (n = 12) to control the resulting haemorrhage. Blood loss and time to haemostasis were accurately recorded. The absorbable materials were left in situ and animals killed between 2 weeks and 6 months later to examine speed of absorption and resulting adhesions. Calcium alginate stopped bleeding in less than 3 min in all animals compared with a mean (+/- s.e.m.) of 5.7 +/- 0.75 min for porcine collagen, 12.5 +/- 0.9 min for oxidized cellulose and greater than 15 min with gauze (P less than 0.001). Oxidized cellulose and calcium alginate reabsorbed within 3 months leaving a fibrous scar, but a vigorous foreign body reaction was seen with porcine collagen which caused intestinal obstruction in 5 out of 12 animals within 3 months.\r"

Such features included postpubertal onset maximal during the third decade; female preponderance (13:5); premenstrual flare in 57 per cent of women; absence of this flare associated with irregular or anovulatory menstrual cycles; and an increased incidence of obesity and acne. Detailed hormone profiles in 36 female patients and 14 controls showed evidence of relative androgen excess and decreased progesterone levels in those patients without a premenstrual flare. Obesity and enhanced peripheral androgen conversion by apocrine tissue are possible explanations for normal serum androgen profiles in patients with a flare. Precise elucidation of the hormonal abnormality is a prerequisite for effective medical treatment of early disease.\r"

In the 106 (72 per cent) patients operated upon, 47 per cent of the cystic swellings were neoplastic and 14 per cent were malignant. In men 29 per cent of cystic swellings were malignant and 11 per cent in women. Only twelve cystic ITS were permanently abolished by aspiration and FNAC was inaccurate in predicting neoplasia. The incidence of malignancy in cystic ITS is higher than generally accepted and most cysts not abolished by aspiration should be removed.\r"

  ".W": "To identify changes in incidence, presentation, management and outcome, 670 patients with torsion of the spermatic cord presenting in Bristol between 1960 and 1984 have been reviewed. Among the susceptible population of 150,000, the annual incidence of torsion has increased fourfold from 11.2 cases between 1960 and 1964 to 42.8 cases between 1980 and 1984. Throughout this period greater than 90 per cent of patients have been managed by general surgeons. Patients aged between 12-18 years comprised 62 per cent but 20 per cent were 21 years or older. Torsion was commoner in the cold months, 24 per cent of cases occurring during December and January (chi 2 = 30.26, P less than 0.01). When acute torsion was relieved within 12 h of the onset of symptoms only 4 per cent of affected testes were considered non-viable, but beyond this time 75 per cent of patients received orchidectomy. Overall, 238 of 624 (38 per cent) acutely twisted testes were found to be infarcted at operation, and a further 35 patients (6 per cent) had marked testicular atrophy on review 3 months later. The testicular salvage rate has steadily improved from 45 per cent in the years 1960-64 to 67 per cent in 1980-84. Much of the increased incidence of testicular torsion is likely to reflect a greater awareness of the condition by general practitioners. It has been more than matched by an improvement in testicular salvage rate because of earlier referral.\r"

Anal sensation was measured in 14 patients before operation, 16 patients after restorative proctocolectomy with end-to-end anastomosis (RP + EEA) and 13 patients after mucosal proctectomy with endo-anal anastomosis 1 cm above the dentate line (MP + EAA). Threshold electrosensitivity was measured in the upper, mid and lower anal canal by means of a bipolar constant current stimulator probe. The 'recto'-anal inhibitory reflex was tested, and the patients' ability to discriminate between flatus and faeces and to release flatus 'safely' was assessed by interview. In the upper anal canal, threshold sensitivity was significantly greater in patients who had undergone MP + EAA than in patients who had undergone RP + EEA (P less than 0.05). In the mid and lower anal canal, electrosensitivity in the three groups of patients did not differ significantly. Twelve patients (75 per cent) regained the 'recto'-anal reflex after RP + EEA, but after MP + EAA only three patients (23 per cent) did so (P less than 0.02). Thirteen patients after RP + EEA could release flatus safely without fear of faecal leakage, compared with only four after MP + EAA (P less than 0.02). The proportions of patients in these two groups who said they were able to discriminate flatus from faeces did not differ significantly. Anal sensation and discriminatory function are significantly better after end-to-end ileoanal anastomosis than after mucosal proctectomy with endo-anal anastomosis.\r"

We examined 15 hospital employees allergic to latex surgical gloves, using various skin tests and RAST, to determine the most reliable diagnostic method and to investigate coexistent allergy to glove powder and rubber chemicals. Prick testing using a stock solution made from one brand of latex glove yielded positive (2+ to 4+) reactions in all 15 employees: 8 retained positive reactions at a 1/10 dilution, 1 at 1/100 and 4 at 1/1000. A prick test using rubber-tree sap (Hevea brasiliensis) was positive in 12/15 employees and a scratch-chamber test using crushed rubber-tree leaf was positive in 13/15. A latex glove use test was positive in 12/13 employees and a latex RAST detected measurable amounts of specific IgE in 8/15. No positive prick test reactions were obtained using glove powder. On patch testing, 2/15 employees showed delayed allergy to rubber chemicals but no immediate reactions were detected. The present results indicate that in addition to the use test, prick testing with a stock solution prepared from latex surgical gloves is an adequate test method for routine practice when diagnosing latex glove contact urticaria. The correlation between prick tests and whole glove use tests was good, but latex RASTs yielded some negative results.\r"

A series of 1,4-substituted benzene derivatives has been used to examine this prohapten concept in the guinea pig model. Using both topical and intradermal routes of application, it is demonstrated that in the guinea pig 1,4-substituted benzene derivatives capable of oxidation to benzoquinone, including hydroquinone and PPD, show only restricted evidence of cross-reactions. These results support the prohapten concept. However taken in combination with data on cross-reactivity with 1,2- and 1,3-substituted benzenes, rather than giving rise to a single common hapten, they can be more readily interpreted as the formation of a spectrum of antigenic determinants in vivo, some of which are shared in common.\r"

Reliance cannot be placed on standard screening trays because such testing can be negative when testing to shoe materials is positive. Furthermore, the relevance of positive screening tests is almost never proven by extracting that allergen from the patient's shoes. We present a case of insole dermatitis to tennis shoes in which we directly isolated the causative allergens by step-by-step patch-test monitoring of active fractions. Chromatographic separation of the active fractions led to the isolation of 2 allergens, mercaptobenzothiazole (Captax) (MBT) and its dimer, dibenzothiazyl disulfide (Altax) (DBTD). Patch tests to DBTD were noticeably more potent than those to MBT. In what might be considered an obvious case of contact sensitivity to MBT, the actual allergen is DBTD. Using this method, unknown shoe allergens can be isolated, identified, and added to the shoe test tray of potential allergens.\r"

When pet. was used, the challenge concentrations could be raised and cross-reactivity between the colour developers, but not with p-phenylenediamine-dihydrochloride, was revealed. When water was used as vehicle, the challenge concentrations were limited because of staining of the test sites and irritation. CD-2, CD-3 and CD-4 were found to be extreme sensitizers according to the classification by Magnusson and Kligman. The importance of using an appropriate vehicle to obtain optimal conditions for the GPMT is stressed. To study the purity and stability of the chemicals used, analysis by HPLC of the test substances at different stages of the GPMT procedure was performed. Aqueous solutions of the colour developers were found to be unstable, while pet. mixtures were stable.\r"

These pentenyl caffeates proved to be the major sensitizers of propolis and of poplar bud secretion in our previous study. In addition, 3 further minor allergens have now been investigated. Experimental sensitization indicates that phenylethyl caffeate is as strong a sensitizer as the major allergen \"LB-1\", while benzyl salicylate is a moderate sensitizer. Benzyl cinnamate plays only a subordinate role. At least 3 further esters of caffeic acid or cinnamic acid remain to be studied. Interestingly, relationships between propolis and balsam of Peru were found. 8 compounds are common to both materials.

We report a follow-up study of 37 diabetic adults with major depression (according to DSM-III), 28 (76%) of whom were located and reinterviewed 5 yr after the index evaluations. At follow-up, 18 (64%) of the 28 depressed patients had experienced an episode of major depression within the previous 12 mo; 12 of these patients satisfied diagnostic criteria for depression at the time of reevaluation. The 18 patients with recurrent depression had a mean of 4.2 depressive episodes over the 5-yr period. An additional 4 patients met criteria for current dysthymic disorder, bringing the number to 22 (79%) of the total patients ill with affective disorder during the 5-yr follow-up period. In contrast, the likelihood of symptomatic affective disorder was only 10% over the same follow-up period in a comparison group of diabetic subjects without depression at the index evaluation (P less than .001). Occurrence of depressive episodes appeared independent of diabetes complications because both the depressed and comparison groups had similar rates of neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy. These data suggest that the natural course of depression in diabetes is malevolent, possibly more so than depression in the medically well.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the wide distribution of devices for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), there is no internationally accepted agreement on a standardized procedure for their evaluation. This is due to incomplete or even inappropriate technical evaluation and to inadequate evaluation criteria for their clinical acceptability. To provide adequate information on the performance of these devices over the whole clinically relevant range for SMBG (30-350 mg/dl), a standardized test procedure has been established for technical (accuracy, precision, and total deviation) and clinical (acceptance analysis) evaluation. To demonstrate the potency of this new approach, the following SMBG devices and test strips were evaluated: Chemstrip bG batch (n = 10), Glucostix batch (n = 2), Accu-Check II (n = 5), Diascan (n = 5), Diascan strip batch (n = 4), Glucocheck SC (n = 4), and Glucometer II (n = 4). The devices and test strips were examined by trained technicians, and in addition, 1 Chemstrip bG batch and 2 Accu-Check II meters were examined by 10 and 5 trained diabetic patients, respectively. Even the best-performing device did not achieve the American Diabetes Association's goal that SMBG measurements should be within 15% of the reference value. Instead, the maximal total deviation within the clinically relevant blood glucose range reached values that equalled deviations from the reference value between 16 and 108%. Three of 36 devices were classified as good, 29 as acceptable, and 4 as unacceptable for clinical use. In conclusion, this new approach to the technical and clinical evaluation of devices for SMBG is easy to perform and provides more realistic and comparable information for clinical use and approval than commonly used methods.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen insulin-dependent diabetic subjects [age (mean +/- SD) 33.2 +/- 10.6 yr] participated in a study designed to determine the metabolic and cutaneous parameters associated with activation of the nocturnal hypoglycemia monitor Sleep Sentry. Plasma glucose, glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and pancreatic polypeptide concentrations were determined every 10 min during a 2-h constant intravenous insulin infusion (40 mU.kg-1.h-1). In addition, skin temperature and electrical conductance were monitored at the same time intervals, and subjects were asked to rate the degree to which they felt cold and/or sweaty. Ten of the subjects (alarmers) activated the device with a mean plasma glucose nadir of 52.8 +/- 13.8 mg/dl, whereas eight (nonalarmers) failed to do so despite a mean plasma glucose nadir of 50.5 +/- 8.2 mg/dl. There were no significant differences between alarmers and nonalarmers with respect to initial or nadir plasma glucose levels, rate of fall of plasma glucose, or changes in plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, or pancreatic polypeptide concentrations. In addition, changes in skin temperature and conductance were similar in both groups as were descriptive variables including age, disease duration, gender, and level of glucose control. No subject reported an increase in coldness, whereas 80% of both groups reported an increase in sweatiness. Three subjects studied on more than one occasion over a year failed to exhibit consistent activation of the alarm. This study suggests that it may not be possible to identify patients for whom the Sleep Sentry would be a reliable addition to their self-management regimen and that physicians should exercise caution in recommending its use.\r"

Nocturnal hypoglycemia (0200-0300 BG concentration less than or equal to 50 mg/dl) occurred in 27 patients (41%) and in 36 profiles (13%). All the patients with nocturnal hypoglycemia received two or more injections of insulin each day. When hypoglycemia occurred at 0200-0300, the preceding BG concentration at 2100 was significantly lower than when nocturnal BG was greater than 100 mg/dl (108 +/- 11 vs. 145 +/- 12 mg/dl; P less than .05; mean +/- SE). A BG less than or equal to 120 mg/dl at 2100 preceded nocturnal hypoglycemia in 24 (67%) of 36 profiles. The mean BG at 0700 was significantly lower in the profiles associated with nocturnal hypoglycemia than in those with nocturnal BG levels greater than 150 mg/dl (156 +/- 10 vs. 201 +/- 11 mg/dl; P less than .05). BG values greater than 180 mg/dl at 0700 were infrequently (11 of 143 or 8% of profiles) preceded by nocturnal hypoglycemia, and no instances of major hyperglycemia (BG greater than 300 mg/dl) at 0700 were preceded by nocturnal hypoglycemia. Furthermore, BG at 0700, 1100, and 1500 on the day before the occurrence of nocturnal hypoglycemia were similar to those on the day after.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cytotoxicity of antibodies towards RPMI 4788 was studied by means of a chromium release assay using peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes of healthy subjects as effector cells. Using a four hour antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity assay sera from 29% of ulcerative colitis patients contained antibodies cytotoxic for the target, while only 3% of the Crohn's patients and 6% of the disease controls and non of the healthy controls were positive. When an 18 hour assay was applied, however, not only 40% of ulcerative colitis patients, but also 14% of Crohn's patients and 21% of disease controls were found positive. The reactive antibody in the four hour assay was mainly of the IgG class, which points at a classical antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity mechanism. In the 18 hour cytotoxic assay IgG and particularly IgM antibodies were found to be reactive. This suggests that in the latter case other cellular cytotoxic mechanism might be involved. There was a significant inverse correlation between the appearance of the ulcerative colitis restricted IgG-anticolon epithelial cell antibodies (four hour assay) and the disease activity (p less than 0.01). Absorption studies showed that the reactive antigen is not specific for ulcerative colitis colonic tissue, but is similarly found in Crohn's bowel tissue, and to a lower extent in normal bowel, liver and kidney. The reactive antigen, however, could not be detected in brain and lymphoblastoid cells.\r"

The effects of the alcohols on gastric parietal cell apical and microsomal membrane vesicle integrity was also studied. Membrane vesicle integrity was determined from the enclosed volume of the vesicle preparations, measured as [14C]glucose space at equilibrium. Exposure of vesicles to the three alcohols caused concentration dependent decreases in enclosed volume. The rank order of potency of the alcohol was octyl greater than benzyl greater than ethyl. Concentrations greater than or equal to 10 mM benzyl alcohol significantly reduced the enclosed volume of duodenal or jejunal vesicles; jejunal vesicles were disrupted by 625 mM ethanol, whereas 2 M ethanol was required to disrupt the duodenal vesicles. Gastric apical membrane integrity was reduced with 0.25 M ethanol, the vesicles being approximately an order of magnitude more sensitive to ethanol than gross estimates of gastric mucosal damage, but 1 M ethanol was required to significantly damage gastric microsomes. All concentrations of benzyl or octyl alcohol tested (greater than or equal to 5 mM) reduced the enclosed volume of both gastric apical membrane vesicles and gastric microsomes. As determined by shrink-swell techniques, benzyl alcohol permeated duodenal vesicles at a faster rate than NH4Cl (apparent rate constant of 9.89 (0.71) X 10(-3)s-1 compared with 4.48 (0.23) X 10(-3)s-1). Therefore, reductions in enclosed volume in response to alcohol treatment could not be explained by alcohol induced osmotic shrinkage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ethanol effect could partly be the result of inflammatory mechanisms, possibly reflected by an enhanced local granulocyte turnover. This study investigated habitual alcoholics by segmental perfusion of the jejunum and analysed the perfusion fluid content of granulocyte granule constituents. The mean jejunal secretion rate of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a neutrophil granule constituent, was 152 (26) (SE) ng/min/40 cm jejunal segment in the controls (n = 16). The MPO secretion rate in non-cirrhotic habitual alcoholics (n = 7) was on average 450 (103) ng/min and significantly increased compared with controls (p less than 0.001). In contrast alcoholics with cirrhosis (n = 6) had normal MPO secretion rate. The mean secretion rate of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), an eosinophil granule constituent, was in the controls 77 (15) ng/min/40 cm jejunal segment. Corresponding values in non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic alcoholics were 141 (38) and 130 (93) ng/min, respectively (ns). The data suggest an enhanced neutrophil granulocyte turnover in the jejunum in alcoholics, possibly contributing to the ethanol induced affection of the small bowel. The lack of increased neutrophil activity in cirrhotic alcoholics may reflect a role of the liver for granulocyte activity.\r"

Whereas BBMV from controls showed a seven-fold enhancement of D-glucose uptake in the presence of an inwardly directed sodium gradient compared with its absence, no such enhancement was seen in the patient's vesicles. In BBMV from the patient, initial D-glucose uptake under sodium gradient conditions was only 10% of the mean control value. In contrast, sodium/proton exchange in BBMV from the patient was intact. These data provide the first unequivocal evidence that the jejunal brush border membrane is the site of a specific defect in sodium dependent glucose transport in glucose-galactose malabsorption. Measurement of glucose uptake by BBMV may well be the optimal diagnostic technique in this disorder.\r"

Lactitol was given as a 20 g daily dose to six healthy volunteers for 14 days and on the seventh day, 10 muCi of L-[U-14C]-lactitol was given with the unlabelled sugar and excretion of the 14C in breath, urine and faeces was followed. The peak of 14CO2 excretion occurred at six hours and total 14CO2 accounted for 62.9 (5.0)% of isotope given, whilst 6.5 (3.6)% and 2.0 (0.3)% of the label were recovered from faeces and urine respectively. These data suggest that lactitol is extensively metabolised in the human colon and that a significant proportion of the bacterial metabolites are available for colonic absorption. Calculation revealed that 54.5% of the theoretical energy content of this compound was utilised by the subjects. It is suggested that this sugar, and other soluble 'non-absorbed' sugars (lactulose, sorbitol, mannitol), may undergo a similar pattern of colonic metabolism and can be considered as reduced calorie compounds.\r"

Two stages of jejunal maturation were observed: an initial stage of morphological development and crypt proliferation (days 12 to 22), followed by a period of stabilisation (days 24 to 30). By day 22 of the initial phase, villi increased principally in width but not in length, crypt length increased, and crypt cell production rate increased from 0.5 (day 12) to 11.1 (day 22) cells/crypt/hour. Various measures of mucosal immune activity showed a biphasic response. Up to days 20 to 22, the weight of the mesenteric lymph node increased seven-fold (p less than 0.0001), counts of jejunal eosinophils and goblet cells increased 3- (p less than 0.0001) and 19-fold (p less than 0.0001) respectively, and mean serum rat mucosal mast cell protease II, released from mucosal mast cells, increased from 24 (day 12) to 313 (day 22) ng/ml (p less than 0.0001). After day 22, mesenteric lymph node weight stabilised, eosinophil count stabilised and goblet cells decreased, serum rat mucosal mast cell protease II decreased three-fold (p less than 0.0001), and mean jejunal count of intraepithelial lymphocytes increased from 26 (day 22) to 54 (day 24) cells per mm of muscularis mucosae (p less than 0.0001), before stabilising. These results demonstrated a close association between maturation of the small intestine and change in activity of the mucosal immune system.\r"

Cryptosporidium was the intestinal parasite most often identified (30%); Isospora belli was found in 12% of the patients. Histological examination of the duodenal mucosa showed a non-specific inflammatory reaction in a significantly higher number of HIV-seropositive patients (82%) than HIV-seronegative controls without diarrhoea (52%) (p = 0.02). Lymphocytes were more likely to be found in inflammatory reactions in HIV-seropositive patients than in controls (p less than 0.0001). Pathogens were observed in histological sections of the duodenum of HIV-seropositive patients only (p = 0.002) and included cryptosporidia (four patients) Isospora belli (one), Strongyloides stercoralis (one), and Cryptococcus neoformans (one). On histological examination the rectal mucosa of HIV-seropositive patients and controls was similar, except eosinophils were more likely to be present in inflammatory reaction in HIV-seropositive patients (p = 0.05) and enteric pathogens were observed only in HIV-seropositive patients (cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies (one) and Schistosoma mansoni (two). The aetiology of persistent diarrhoea in most African AIDS patients remains unclear.\r"

In the patients with idiopathic neurogenic anorectal incontinence the internal anal sphincter showed loss of smooth muscle cells, disruption of the normal relationships of the remaining cells, stretching of elastic tissue, and increased collagen fibril content. These ultrastructural changes in the morphology of the internal anal sphincter, although probably not the primary cause of faecal incontinence, have functional relevance in the clinical syndrome, as shown by the reduction in resting anal canal pressure found in some patients with this syndrome.\r"

A specially designed probe with the electrodes inside a low pressure expandable insulating latex balloon was introduced in the oesophagus. Stepwise inflation and deflation was done for analysis of oesophageal compliance and hysteresis. The rabbits were allocated to three groups: a control group, one with oesophageal varices and one with varices which were treated by sclerotherapy. The oesophageal varices were induced by portal banding five months before the investigation. A uniform pattern of changes in the biomechanical properties of the oesophageal wall was seen in the group with oesophageal varices when compared with controls. The compliance was significantly decreased, and the hysteresis was lessened. Endoscopic sclerotherapy changed the wall properties to a pattern not distinguishable from normal. Thus, in vivo investigation of the biomechanical wall properties showed a significant loss of distensibility of the oesophagus with varices and restorement of the wall distensibility when the varices were treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy.\r"

  ".U": "89121608\r", 
  ".W": "Aspirin, acetyl salicylic acid, damages gastric mucosal cells. This effect is considered related to its inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. On the other hand, sodium salicylate has been reported to be cytoprotective against drug damage to gastric mucosa in vivo. One reason for this difference is that salicylic acid, unlike acetyl salicylic acid does not inhibit prostaglandin synthesis by gastric mucosa in vivo. Previous studies on tissue culture cells from our laboratory have required gastric mucosa from fetal rats; this was time consuming and expensive. The purpose of this study was to develop a primary cell culture of adult rat fundic epithelial cells and to test the effect of sodium salicylate on: (1) prostaglandin (PGE2) production, (2) cell viability, (3) reducing cell damage by sodium taurocholate. Gastric epithelial cells were isolated from adult rat stomachs and cultured on collagen gel. Cells reached confluency on day 4 at which stage fibroblasts were rarely seen (less than 1%). Autoradiographic study showed that cultured cells incorporated [3-H] thymidine into nuclei. In histochemical studies, 94% of the cells contained PAS positive granules (mucous cells). Mucous granules were observed in the cytoplasm of the majority of cells by electronmicroscopy. These cells synthesised prostaglandin E2 as determined by radioimmunoassay. Indomethacin 10(-4) M strongly suppressed PGE2 production after 30 minutes while 10(-3) and 10(-4)M sodium salicylate had no effect. Pharmacologic concentrations of 10 mM sodium salicylate had no effect on PGE2 production at 30 minutes and only weakly inhibited production after one hour incubation. Sodium salicylate up to 30 mM had no effect on cell viability, a concentration of 50 mM being necessary to produce significant cell damage. Sodium salicylate 10 mM significantly protected cells against damage induced by 10 mM sodium taurocholate. We conclude: (i) adult rat gastric mucous epithelial cells can be successfully cultured in vitro; (ii) prostaglandin synthesis is inhibited by indomethacin but not by low doses of sodium salicylate; (iii) sodium salicylate does not damage gastric mucosal cells except at very high concentrations; (iv) sodium salicylate protects against damage to cells induced by sodium taurocholate.\r"

  ".U": "89121609\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of intermittent dosage with omeprazole on basal and pentagastrin stimulated gastric acid secretion and fasting plasma gastrin was assessed in eight duodenal ulcer subjects who were in remission. Omeprazole (20 mg daily) was given for a three day 'weekend' each week for two months. Twenty four hours after the first and eighth weekend, basal and peak acid output were still markedly suppressed (greater than 50%) compared with pretreatment. After the treatment free four days, however (just before the eighth weekend), peak acid output had returned to pretreatment values; basal acid output was still somewhat reduced (mean 3.6 mmol/l) but the difference from baseline was not statistically significant. Fasting plasma gastrin concentration increased slightly but significantly, from a baseline median of 17 pmol/l to 25 and 31 pmol/l respectively, 24 hours after the first and eighth weekends. All but two values (of 16) remained within the reference range. Before the fourth and eighth weekends, and again at 12 days and three months after treatment, gastrin values were not significantly different from baseline. Thus a 'weekend therapy' regimen with this long acting antisecretory compound produces substantial acid suppression, but for only part of the week, with modest and reversible changes in fasting plasma gastrin. It should therefore be suitable for efficacy testing for prevention of recurrence of peptic ulcer or reflux oesophagitis.\r"

Benign oesophageal stricture was present in 23 (41%) of 56 patients consecutive with CLO. In 18 the stricture lay at the squamocolumnar mucosal junction and was associated with reflux oesophagitis, in five it was situated in the columnar lined segment and in four of these it was known to have been preceded by a chronic ulcer at the site of the stricture. Controls were an age and sex matched group of patients with benign stricture related to reflux oesophagitis unassociated with columnar epithelialisation. CLO associated strictures involving squamous mucosa were situated significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in the oesophagus than non-CLO strictures. The response to endoscopic dilatation and active medical treatment was significantly better, as judged by the need for subsequent dilatation (p less than 0.01) in the CLO than in the non-CLO group. It is concluded that associated columnar epithelialisation of the oesophagus is not in itself an indication for antireflux surgery in the management of benign stricture and these usually respond well to dilatation and medical treatment.\r"

One of these is the double sampling technique of George which has the advantage that it enables multiple measurements of total gastric volume in one experiment. In order to estimate net gastric emptying, however, it is important to differentiate between the test meal volume present in the stomach and gastric secretion. In the present study George's technique was extended with a calculation procedure to estimate gastric secretion and net test meal outflow. An in vitro experiment was carried out which showed an accuracy of 5-10% for this method. An in vivo comparison was made with Hunt's chloride technique, which is used for estimating gastric secretion. Sixteen subjects participated in a 60 minute test with water as a test meal. Regression analysis showed a high degree of correlation (R2 = 0.99) between Hunt's method and the proposed method. The data obtained indicate that the proposed method gives a reliable estimation of net gastric emptying and is simple to do as no further measurements have to be carried out other than those needed for George's method.\r"

  ".W": "Applied potential tomography (APT) is a new, non-invasive technique that can yield sequential images of changes in the resistivity of gastric contents. Studies were performed to investigate the application of APT to measure gastric acid secretion. Experiments in 20 normal volunteers showed that changes in gastric resistivity were closely correlated with changes in the volume (r = 0.80), the acidity (r = 0.83) and the total conductivity of gastric contents (r = 0.87). Studies in 13 patients referred for a pentagastrin test showed that changes in gastric resistivity before pentagastrin were closely correlated with basal acid output measured on a separate occasion (r = 0.85, p less than 0.001), while changes in gastric resistivity after pentagastrin were correlated with maximal acid output (r = 0.58, p less than 0.05). Ingestion of alcohol by six normal subjects decreased gastric resistivity markedly, probably due to alcohol induced gastric acid secretion as it was prevented by cimetidine. Applied potential tomography is a safe non-invasive method of measuring gastric acid secretion. The equipment is simple to use, and the test is comfortable and acceptable to patients.\r"

This study has now been extended and includes both nonirradiated and irradiated mandibles. Of a total of 46 nonirradiated mandibles (10 partially dentate and 36 edentulous) invaded by tumor, 41 were invaded through the occlusal surface. This confirms the findings of the preliminary report. These findings indicate that there is a rational basis on pathologic grounds for adopting a conservative approach to the nonirradiated mandible. In 16 irradiated mandibles, the routes of tumor entry were found to be much more variable than in the nonirradiated mandible. In 16 irradiated mandibles, the routes of tumor entry were found to be much more variable than in the nonirradiated mandible, and multiple foci of tumor invasion of the bone were often present wherever tumor in adjacent soft tissues approached the bone. This variability of tumor entry means that a conservative approach to mandibular excision cannot be pursued in the previously irradiated mandible and full-thickness segmental resection is necessary if bone involvement appears likely.\r"

  ".W": "For patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck whose primary lesion is managed with radiotherapy, radiotherapy alone or in combination with neck dissection may be used to treat clinically positive neck nodes. Although these two treatment options produce similar control rates for small mobile nodes, it is our impression that radiotherapy plus neck dissection is the preferred treatment for more advanced neck disease. The question that arises is whether the addition of a neck dissection after radiotherapy will decrease the likelihood of successful surgical management of a subsequent recurrence at the primary site. In an effort to answer this question, the records of 227 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were reviewed. All patients had clinically positive neck nodes and were treated with radiotherapy alone to the primary lesion. There was no apparent difference in the rate of disease control at the primary site or in the ability to manage patients successfully who developed a local recurrence when comparing patients initially treated with radiotherapy alone to those managed by radiotherapy and neck dissection. We conclude that postradiotherapy neck dissection does not decrease the likelihood of successfully managing a recurrence at the primary site.\r"

The objective was to determine whether the incidence of this cancer exhibited the inverse association with geographic latitude that is characteristic of skin cancer incidence. The SEER areas were grouped into three regions (north, central, and south), based on indices of ultraviolet radiation. The southern area had significantly higher rates for white males and females compared with the northern area for all histologic subtypes combined (standardized incidence ratios were 1.6 for males and 1.4 for females), as well as for specific histologic subtypes (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and males only with mucoepidermoid carcinoma). However, there were no significant differences in incidence between the central and northern areas. These data provide further evidence of an association between skin and salivary neoplasms, both exhibiting a pattern of incidence suggestive of susceptibility to ultraviolet radiation exposure.\r"

In the other aneuploid case, the patient died of disseminated disease 8 months after presentation despite having a low-grade (follicular, predominantly small cleaved cell type) and low-stage (tumor confined to thyroid at presentation) lymphoma. These data suggest that the DNA ploidy of primary NHL of the thyroid can be determined using fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue.

This article presents the clinical and histopathologic characteristics of 23 new cases. The patients' ages ranged from 3 to 19 years (median 9). Most tumors were asymptomatic and were associated with an unerupted tooth or teeth. All patients were treated with simple enucleation of the tumor. We found that histologically these lesions comprise a spectrum. Some were probably benign odontogenic tumors (neoplasms) and others were odontomas undergoing maturation (hamartomas); however, in any given case we were, on histologic grounds, unable to differentiate the two. The majority, if not all, of our cases were nonaggressive with little or no tendency to recur, whereas some reported cases have exhibited local aggressiveness and recurrence, suggestive of neoplasia. In our opinion, it is clinically important to distinguish the mixed odontogenic tumors from ameloblastoma since the mixed tumors, found mostly in children, are relatively benign when compared to ameloblastoma, which is found in all age groups (usually adults). The usually innocuous behavior of these lesions does not justify aggressive treatment initially, and simple enucleation should be appropriate in most cases.\r"

By contrast, it was found in the irradiated specimens that osteoblastic activity was absent but that osteoclastic activity persisted. The hemopoietic marrow was replaced by fibrous tissue. The lack of osteoblastic activity was interpreted as being due to irradiation. The extent of these changes and their relationship to the invading tumor have implications for both surgeon and pathologist.\r"

The local and regional treatment consisted of initial surgical resection followed by postoperative radiotherapy. Forty-three patients were not treated by induction chemotherapy; 95 patients received preoperative chemotherapy with bleomycin as a single agent; 98 patients received three preoperative courses of vincristine, methotrexate, bleomycin, or endoxan, and 46 patients were treated by three courses of induction chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, bleomycin, methotrexate, or 5-fluorouracil. Seventy-two patients received less than 150 mg of bleomycin and 17 patients received only one or two cycles of multiple-agent chemotherapy. Survivals were higher when multiple-agent chemotherapy was employed as compared with single-agent induction chemotherapy. Further prospective investigations are necessary to confirm that induction chemotherapy enhances survival in pyriformk sinus cancers.\r"

Intramuscular hemangioma is seldom diagnosed preoperatively, perhaps due to unfamiliarity with this uncommon lesion. Preoperative diagnosis is important, however, to properly evaluate feeding arterial blood supply and prevent potential operative morbidity. Surgical excision represents the treatment of choice. Intramuscular hemangioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of deep head and neck masses.\r"

The mean age was 61 years, sex distribution was equal, and 75% occurred in the parotid. Only 42% presented with signs or symptoms other than a painless mass. Glandular excision was done in early stages of the disease while biopsy was done at later stages. Frozen section analysis was accurate in all but one case and was useful in determining if biopsy were adequate. All patients were definitively treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Several instructive points are apparent. Any patient presenting with an isolated salivary gland mass can have a lymphoma. There has, in fact, been a significantly increasing proportion of salivary gland lymphoma among the various salivary gland tumors in our patient population. In contrast to other salivary gland tumors, surgery is reserved for diagnosis and not for treatment. A lymph node biopsy may be sufficient to establish a diagnosis, in which case, glandular excision is unnecessary. Most of the patients presented with an asymptomatic isolated salivary gland mass. The presence of adjacent adenopathy, a rubbery feel to the mass, and the intraoperative appearance were the most suggestive signs of lymphoma. Frozen section analysis is helpful in determining the appropriate extent of surgery and is recommended.\r"

Systematic computed tomography evaluation with contrast serves to define the extent of the lesion and assist in the differential diagnosis of parapharyngeal masses.

Aside from distant metastasis to the lung, liver, and brain, the regional metastatic spread pattern includes the nodal groups of the buccal, submental, and submandibular areas, with the possibility of bilateral involvement. All consultants agreed that the primary tumor should be treated with a wide local excision; however, there is no agreement as to the extent of nodal groups included in the nodal dissection. No consultant recommended primary septal reconstruction. The use of postoperative radiotherapy in high-dose fractions remains experimental, in the protocol research stage.\r"

  ".W": "Because cardiac output decreases after burn injuries, investigators have assumed, based upon dye clearance techniques, that hepatic and intestinal blood flow are also decreased following these injuries. Blood flow to the liver, stomach, small intestine, and kidney was determined by the uptake of 201thallium and 125I-labeled fatty acid (para-125I-phenyl-3-methyl pentanoic acid) in a 20% body surface area scald injury that also included plasma volume replacement resuscitation. Uptake of these radioisotopes was determined 15 minutes, 18 hours, and 72 hours after injury. The uptake of the 201thallium and 125I-labeled fatty acid by the gastrointestinal tissues was not statistically different at any of the time periods after comparison of the injured and control (sham-treated) animals. 201Thallium uptake by the kidney was significantly diminished 15 minutes after the burn injury (P less than 0.01). Based on these blood flow measurement techniques, the data suggest that the 20% body surface area scald injury did not alter blood flow to the liver or gastrointestinal tract within the initial 72 hours after the burn injury even though a decrease in renal blood flow was easily detected. These results suggest that the dysfunction of the gastrointestinal system or hepatic system observed after an acute burn injury is not simply the result of hypovolemic shock, which reduces both renal and mesenteric blood flow. These gastrointestinal and hepatic alterations may be related to a factor or factors other than intestinal ischemia.\r"

Profession, sex, and years of contact with burned patients did not influence inter-rater agreement. Any randomly selected panel of four raters produced reliable average ratings. The effect of impaired skin texture on overall ratings of cosmetic disfigurement (both clothed and unclothed) was three to five times as important as the effect of impaired color. Despite its subjectivity, cosmetic disfigurement can be measured reliably.

Final results--including lip length, scar appearance, vermilion quality, and lip roll--were assessed and compared to early and conservative excisional techniques. Burn appliance therapy results were equivalent to results of excisional techniques. Burn appliance therapy additionally preserved the potential for secondary cosmetic repair. Appliance therapy may therefore reduce the number of surgical revisions required to achieve an acceptable results with a concurrent decrease of in-patient hospital days and total patient cost. We believe that nonsurgical management of perioral burns with use of a burn appliance is the treatment of choice for these injuries.\r"

Significant improvements were seen in both mean test scores and the percentage of children answering all the test questions correctly. A much less formal type of evaluation was done with the elderly group. Senior citizens were assisted with a pre-program questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire were compared to the results of \"BURN-GO\" (copyright 1986), a bingotype game, played immediately after the educational session. Again, the post-implementation results of the program were significantly higher than those achieved prior to the intervention.\r"

This study was done to determine whether subeschar tissue fluid (STF) functions as an immunobiologic reservoir. Seven patients with a mean BSA burn of 55% underwent isotonic volume resuscitation and burn treatment with low penetration topical agents. STF was collected at the time of fascial excision. Chemical analysis of STF was similar to serum; bacterial cultures grew no organisms. Ten percent dilutions of STF and burn serum significantly blunted mitogen-induced blastogenic response compared to control serum. STF was significantly more suppressive than burn serum (P less than .03). Conclusions: 1. STF may act as both an immunologic barrier to microbial clearance in otherwise viable subcutaneous tissue and a reservoir for systemically reabsorbed immunosuppressive factors. 2. In addition to removing dead tissue, fascial excision may prove beneficial because it removes large amounts of immunosuppressive STF.\r"

In this study, isolated coronary perfused guinea pig hearts were used to determine if free radical scavengers improve left ventricular (LV) intrinsic contractile response to burn shock. Parameters measured included peak isovolumic LV pressure (LVP) and maximal rate of LVP rise (+dP/dtmax) and fall (-dP/dtmax) at a constant preload. Control animals were immersed in body temperature water and divided into four groups: Group 1, untreated N = 10; Group 2, control animals treated with unbound superoxide dismutase (SOD), N = 5; Group 3, control animals treated with ficoll-SOD, N = 5; and Group 4, control animals treated with PEG-SOD, N = 5. Scald burn equivalent to 45% of total body surface area was produced in 64 animals. Fluid resuscitation was initiated immediately after burn in all animals, and animals were then divided into seven burn experimental groups. In Group 5, 10 animals were treated with fluid alone, lactated Ringer's, 4 mL/kg/% burn. Burned animals in Group 6 (N = 10) received a reduced volume of Ringer's 2 mL/kg/% burn plus unbound-SOD, 50 mg/kg; 10 animals in Group 7 received this volume of Ringer's plus ficoll-SOD, 50 mg/kg. In groups 8, 9, and 10 animals were given fluid, lactated Ringer's, 2 mL/kg/% burn plus varying doses of PEG-SOD (Group 8: N = 9, 1,000 U; Group 9: N = 10, 6,000 U; Group 10: N = 5, 12,000 U). In Group 11 (N = 10), animals received SOD-PEG, 6,000 U, plus catalase, CAT-PEG, 6,000 U, given with 4 mL/kg/% burn lactated Ringer's solution. Hypotension, hypothermia, and hemoconcentration were similar in all animals after thermal injury, regardless of treatment regimen. Burn hearts showed significantly lower LVP, +dP/dt max, and -dP/dt max than control hearts (P less than 0.05). Compared to controls, coronary pressure and coronary vascular resistance were significantly higher in all treated burn groups. There was no significant difference in heart rate or time to peak pressure or time to maximal contraction or relaxation among the groups. Left ventricular function curves for burned hearts were shifted downward and to the right of curves obtained from control hearts (P less than 0.01), regardless of scavenger treatment. PEG-SOD, 6,000 U, improved left ventricular contractility (+dP/dt) at maximal levels of end-diastolic pressure but deficits in left ventricular pressure and relaxation persisted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the last four years, we have had five cases of noncandidal sepsis (four mucoraceae and one aspergillus) that are illustrative of these differences. Early recognition and diagnosis are essential. Radical excision when the infection is confined to superficial invasion of only one anatomic area is key to decreasing mortality from this lethal disease.\r"

The evidence suggests that treating burn wounds with 1% silver sulfadiazine cream (SSD) is contributory, but that other factors exist, possibly including burn stress. Differences of opinion exist as to whether SSD applications to the wounds of non-septic burn patients should be discontinued if EPBL develops. A survey of opinion in 101 North American burn treatment facilities and a review of the literature show a strengthening of the perception that EPBL, whether caused by SSD or not, holds little risk for the burn patient. The majority of burn patients are now being assigned to treatment strategies in which the onset of EPBL requires discontinuance of SSD only at WBC counts lower than 2,000/cu mm or not at all. This is significantly lower (p less than .02) than the mean of the values recorded in the literature. There is now substantial experience with continuing the SSD therapy in this setting regardless of the WBC count. No complications are reported therefrom.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the true etiology of MRSA burn wound infections. Patients with a 30% or greater TBSA burn had both burned and unburned skin surface cultured upon admission, using RODAC plates. All other body fluids were cultured when sepsis was suspected. Admission cultures of 14 patients who developed MRSA wound infections were examined for methicillin-resistant organisms. Both admission isolates and infection isolates were compared by antibiogram analysis. Of the 14 patients admitted who developed MRSA infections, 57.1% of these had methicillin-resistant staphylococci present on admission. However, the remaining 42.9% of the patients had methicillin-sensitive, B-lactamase positive staphylococci present on admission. Isolates of group D streptococci resistant to methicillin were isolated in 35.7% of the patients. This data suggests that burn wound infections caused by MRSA very likely arise from the endogenous flora present at the time of injury through conferring the resistant plasmid by conjugational transfer.\r"

All of the study boxes had some organism present on or in the used box; the most common type found was Staphylococcus aureus. Eleven of the 13 subjects (85%) had specific antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus present on cultures obtained from open wounds. Seven (64%) of these corresponded to the glove boxes assigned to that patient. The remaining four boxes of gloves had no S. aureus present. In all of the boxes of gloves that had positive S. aureus cultures, 100% of the resistant strains occurred after it was first cultured from the patient. As a result, nonsterile gloves can be used safely for routine non-invasive procedures in the thermally injured patient. It is imperative to avoid using a common box of gloves for two or more patients to prevent the transfer of organisms between patients.\r"

The combining of home health care with burn prevention activities has proven to be an effective means of reaching thousands of high-risk homes per year. We believe this approach would be equally effective in other areas.\r"

The dialogue is delivered in a manner that is not threatening. It covers the child's hospitalization, types of burns and how they heal, feelings on scarring and returning to school as well as the conventional preventive measures. The realism in the video comes from the puppets, which have been specially constructed to teach children about burns, skin grafts, donor sites, and rehabilitative garments. High technology comes from the use of the puppets' pretaped accounts incorporated with the actual puppet show creating a completely integrated presentation. Initial response has been overwhelmingly positive. Our survey of one control group one week after viewing the puppet show demonstrated that all found it favorable. Forty percent remembered basic first aid and 65% mentioned significant points of the presentation. We plan to continue ongoing evaluations with the estimated 1,500 children who will view our program this school year.\r"

The muscle vascularized pedicle flap technique allows one to select a skin territory and convert it into a free flap donor site as long as it is within the arc of rotation of a major vascular pedicle. The vascular pedicle and small portion of muscle is simply sutured to a sequentially delayed skin flap. After approximately two or three weeks the newly revascularized skin and subcutaneous tissue is transferred as a conventional free flap. The main advantage is that of freeing the reconstructive surgeon from the anatomical landmarks of the conventional free flap areas. In addition, one can fashion a very thin flap to fit the defect exactly. Illustrative cases are presented.\r"

The results correlated significantly by regression analysis (r = .87, p less than .01, 1/Young's Modulus of Elasticity v percent stretch in vivo). Normal dorsal hand skin was tested elastometrically in six volunteers of both sexes. Values (units: percent stretch) ranged from 29 to 43 with a small standard error (+/- 4%). In nine patients with hypertrophic burn scars, the mean percent stretch was 16.2 +/- 1.8 v 37.9 +/- 6.5 in the mirror-image normal skin. There was no overlap between the two groups. There was a trend towards higher values in older scars. Elastometric measurements have increased appreciably in some burn scars undergoing treatment. The elastometer should be useful in documenting objectively the spontaneous maturation of burn scars and/or their response to treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was conducted to determine if a Wright's stain of stool specimen to detect fecal leukocytes was accurate in predicting the presence of a bacterial pathogen on stool culture. Entry criteria were patient age greater than or equal to 3 months and diarrhea of greater than 1 day. The patient population was drawn from an urban county hospital emergency department on the Texas-Mexican border. A total of 69 patients were evaluated by both routine stool culture and stool Wright's stain. Twenty-three were evaluated for parasitic pathogens. There were seventeen cultures positive for bacterial pathogens and twenty-three positive Wright's stains. Bacterial isolates included Shigella, Salmonella and Campylobacter. Also detected were Giardia, Shistosoma, Blastocytis and Cryptosporidium. The sensitivity of a Wright's stain positive for fecal leukocytes for the presence of a bacterial pathogen by culture was 82%, with a specificity of 83%. These were significantly correlated with a positive culture for a bacterial pathogen (P less than .01). The predictive value of a positive result was 61%, and predictive value of a negative result was 94%, for bacterial pathogens. The Wright's stain is a useful tool for the early presumptive diagnosis of infectious bacterial diarrhea in the emergency department.\r"

The number per ejaculate of spermatozoa with regular oval heads was the best discriminant, followed by the concentration of progressively motile spermatozoa. This contrasts with the in vivo fertilizing capacity, which depends mostly on the proportion and concentration of spermatozoa with rapid linear progression. The lower limit of sperm characteristics was assessed as the fifth percentile of in vitro fertile semen and was compared with the lower limit of semen of fertile men and of subfertile men who achieved spontaneous or treatment-related conception in vivo. It appeared that the semen quality needed for in vitro fertilization is inferior to that of fertile men but not remarkably different from that of subfertile men who achieved spontaneous conception during 1-year follow-up after consultation. If conventional methods for semen preparation are used, there seems to be no major advantage in favor of IVF for the treatment of male infertility due to sperm deficiency. An increased success rate may, however, be attained, thanks to improved techniques of semen collection, semen preparation, and oocyte insemination.\r"

No differences could be detected using these assays. The lack of sensitivity of the mouse bioassays could not be attributed to the protein source or medium type. The hamster sperm motility assay (HSMA) permitted quantitative discrimination between water sources (Milli-Q greater than HPLC greater than tap). Media prepared for use in human IVF using water that exceeded minimal HSMA quality standards resulted in pregnancy rates that were greater than those attained with a lot of HPLC water that did not meet these standards. The HSMA can serve as a basis for a quality-control program in the human IVF laboratory.\r"

We have compared our PP results with those using a conventional, individualized, and fully monitored protocol (OP) in order to show that PP does not compromise the quality of care. Hormonal presuppression made possible an arbitrary starting day for the cycle. In 80% of the cycles, oocyte retrieval (OR) was performed on the planned day or 1 day later. There was no statistically significant difference between the two regimens in oocyte/embryo numbers, quality or pregnancy rates. The cycle cost was significantly reduced. In addition, patient stress was lessened because of the reasonable predictability of cycle timing. We conclude that PP has significant financial and emotional advantages for the patient over OP but does not appear to diminish the chance for pregnancy in an IVF cycle. PP also allows program staff to manage time more effectively, thereby reducing staff stress.\r"

Women not intending to continue IVF had older husbands, a larger proportion was mothers, and more of them had an IVF pregnancy. Those stopping and continuing, however, did not differ in their ages, the length of their infertility, or their number of IVF attempts. Women's intentions about IVF were best predicted by their attitudes toward another attempt and their perceptions of social pressures. While women intending to continue or discontinue IVF had similar beliefs about the value of motherhood, the satisfactions in having children, the importance of happy marriages, and the need to be well adjusted; discontinuers were less optimistic about another attempt making them mothers, making their marriages happier, or improving the quality of their lives. Both groups of women, however, judged another IVF attempt as likely to involve some stress, disappointment, and financial strain. In terms of their perceptions of social pressures, discontinuers also believed that their husbands, family, friends, and doctors did not think that they should have another IVF attempt. Finally, infertile women's attitudes about having another attempt and their perceptions of social pressures to try again or to stop were better predictors of their decisions about IVF than the background characteristics and fertility histories of women and their husbands. At the same time, together these variables explained only half of the variance in women's IVF decisions, and many other factors need to be considered in future research.\r"

Ten women with ovarian cysts formed during induction of ovulation were treated by puncture and aspiration and compared to a control group of five patients in whom the ovarian cysts could not be punctured. Induction protocols in both groups were based on hMG/hCG or pFSH/hCG administration. In patients in the study group the mean volume aspirated from cysts was 7.4 +/- 2.1 ml. Mean estrogene (E2) levels on the day of hCG were 1411 +/- 213 and 1036 +/- 177 pg/ml in the hMG and pFSH groups, respectively. Mean progesterone (p) levels were 1.6 +/- 0.4 and 1.9 +/- 0.3 ng/ml, respectively. Oocyte collection was done with the aid of a vaginal ultrasound transducer. A mean of 6.2 and 5 oocytes was picked up respectively, with a fertilization rate of 74.3 and 69.1%. In all cases embryo transfer was performed. Two clinical pregnancies were achieved, one in each of the induction protocol groups. In the control group, patients underwent early luteinization, i.e., requiring cancelation of the cycle, after the ovarian cysts had not been aspirated. It is suggested that puncture and aspiration of ovarian cysts occurring during induction of ovulation may be an efficient method to avoid early luteinization. It should be evaluated further.\r"

As expected, marked contralateral and less severe ipsilateral visual inattention were observed in patients with right-sided cerebral lesions whereas those with left-sided lesions showed only mild contralateral neglect. Stimulus material (shapes vs letters) and array (random vs structured) interacted in a complex manner to influence target detection only in patients with right-sided lesions. Furthermore, the search strategy of these patients tended to be erratic, particularly when the stimuli were in an unstructured array. A structured array prompted a more systematic and efficient search. It appears, therefore, that stimulus content and spatial array affect neglect behaviour in patients with right-sided lesions and that a lack of systematic visual exploration within the extrapersonal space is one factor that contributes to visual hemispatial inattention.\r"

The most frequently occurring type of lesions were multiple lacunar infarctions of the brain (43%). These were combined with other types of stroke in an additional 21%. Atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries occurred alone in 18% and was associated with other types of stroke in another 25%. Embolic cerebral infarctions were present alone in 8% and were combined with other types of stroke in 15%. MID was more frequent in men (62%) than women (p less than 0.002). Mean bihemispheric gray matter cerebral blood flow (CBF) values showed a fluctuating course and when results were pooled and compared between different types of MID, extracranial occlusive disease and/or multiple lacunar infarctions resulted in lowest CBF values. The location of cerebral infarctions was more importantly related to cognitive impairments than was the total volume of infarcted brain. Mortality rates among 125 MID patients followed for 31 months has been 5%. Correct clinical classification of the types of cerebrovascular lesions was confirmed in three necropsied cases.\r"

A broad range of GDH activity was found in all three groups. Low activity failed to correlate with a specific clinical entity. Patients followed to post-mortem examination to date have demonstrated histological features of at least three distinct morbid entities. It is concluded, contrary to earlier reports including the authors', that low leukocyte GDH activity does not identify a particular type of multiple system atrophy.\r"

Twenty eight patients, 13 women and 15 men, mean age 37 years (range 15-78), were studied with dystonia or tremor in whom the onset of abnormal movements was related, in time and in distribution, to injury of a body part. Among 23 patients with latency of less than one year after injury, focal dystonia of the involved body part was found in 18, nine of whom had associated reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). One of five patients with peripherally induced tremor had RSD. Abnormal electromyography or nerve conduction velocities were found in the affected limb in four patients, but other electrophysiologic techniques provided evidence for disturbed central function. In 15 patients (65%) possible predisposing factors may have contributed to the pathogenesis of the trauma induced abnormal involuntary movements.\r"

  ".U": "89124930\r", 
  ".W": "There are conflicting reports about factors that may be associated with the development of involuntary movements in patients exposed to long-term neuroleptic treatment. Recent evidence suggests that some of these inconsistencies may relate to the practice of regarding these disorders as a unitary syndrome. There is also evidence that both the topographic distribution of these involuntary movements and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying them may differ in the young and in the old. In this study, demographic, clinical, treatment and neuropsychological variables were investigated for association with the presence of orofacial and limb-truncal dyskinesias in 57 schizophrenic patients aged less than 60 years. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis showed that orofacial dyskinesia, at different degrees of severity, was negatively associated with positive schizophrenic syndrome and with either age at assessment or age at onset of illness. None of the indices of schizophrenic deficit (cognitive impairment, clinical defect state, behavioural deterioration, or neurological dysfunction) was related to orofacial dyskinesia. Limb-truncal involuntary movements were negatively related to current daily dosage of neuroleptics. The findings indicate that these two types of dyskinesia may involve different underlying mechanisms and that, for young schizophrenic patients, current pathophysiological or neurochemical theories of involuntary movement disorders are inadequate in explaining their origins.\r"

These variables, in isolation and in interaction with each other, were found to have a number of effects on both asymmetry and overall level of responding. The results were interpreted in the context of an information processing model of functional hemisphere asymmetry in schizophrenia, and the implications regarding the nature of schizophrenic symptomatology and the effects of antipsychotic drugs were discussed.\r"

All patients had raised intracranial pressure (27.4, SE 1.7 cm.CSF). CSF AVP levels were significantly elevated in benign intracranial hypertension (2.1, SE 0.3 pmol/l) compared with controls (0.7, SE 0.1 pmol/l, p less than 0.001) but CSF OT concentrations were similar in both groups. CSF osmolality and plasma AVP and osmolality were identical in patients and controls. There was no correlation between CSF AVP concentration and intracranial pressure. The selective elevation of AVP in CSF may be of importance in the pathogenesis of raised intracranial pressure in benign intracranial hypertension.\r"

In 10 patients with unilateral cerebellar lesions associated with ipsilateral past-pointing there was an asymmetry in finger stability. Compared with normal subjects there was a significant decrease in stability contralateral to the lesion, while the ipsilateral side's stability was not different from normal. In patients with high brain stem lesions at the level of cranial nerves VII and above, tremor had frequencies of 5-7 Hz. In those with lower brain stem lesions, often with long tract signs as well, the frequencies of tremor were faster, 8-11 Hz, which may reflect damage to cerebellar inflow tracts. A broad if not specific correlation was found between clinical condition, site of lesion and finger stability and tremor.\r"

After baseline testing with a localisation task that permitted no feedback about performance accuracy, prism adaptation was tested at 4 minute intervals over a 28 minute trial. All subjects erred initially, reaching too far to the left of the target, but a separate pointing task encouraged adaptation and reaching error decreased at a similar rate in Parkinsonians and controls. Immediately after the prisms were removed, all subjects reached to the right of the target. This negative after effect was present in controls but not patients when assessed 4 minutes later, suggesting that the patients could not maintain the new sensorimotor relationship imposed by the prisms after their removal. This is similar to performance on visuospatial and executive tasks in Parkinsonians, where ongoing behaviour cannot be modulated without external guidance.\r"

Antibodies to HSV were detected in CSF and serum from the 14 HSVE-patients with a reactivated HSV infection and from 3 of the 5 patients with a primary HSV infection. The predominant subclass pattern was an early HSV-specific IgG1 rise, followed by IgG3 and, more seldom, IgG4; HSV IgG2 was rarely seen. In HSVE patients, HSV IgG3 was absent in early samples and usually appeared 10-20 days after onset of disease. In 14 out of 16 seropositive healthy controls, on the other hand, HSV IgG3 was present in the CSF. Rising VZV IgG levels in serum and CSF were found in 11 HSVE patients. Eight of them showed signs of intrathecal VZV IgG1 synthesis. The VZV IgG reactivity was restricted to IgG1 in 7 of these whereas the HSV IgG subclass response also included IgG3 or 4. The appearance of several HSV IgG subclasses appeared to serve as a marker of HSV infection in spite of the serological VZV reaction, usually restricted to VZV IgG1. Intrathecal synthesis of the quantitatively minor HSV IgG3 and 4 subclasses was detected earlier than intrathecal synthesis of total HSV IgG, dominated by IgG1 in 4 patients with HSVE.\r"

Analysis of the EMG findings in acute and chronic lesions shows that CRD are a feature of a chronic proximal motor axon lesion. Furthermore, the frequently focal occurrence of CRD in the iliopsoas muscle in clinically distal diabetic polyneuropathies suggests that this muscle and its nerves represent a locus minoris resistentiae.\r"

This group comprised 6 acute infantile, 12 chronic childhood, and 3 each with adult-onset proximal, and distal forms of the disorder. Distal HMN constituted 12.5% of the total cases. The crude average annual incidence of acute infantile HMN was 0.3/100,000 total population and 1/12,500 births in Benghazi. The crude prevalence rates of chronic childhood, adult-onset proximal, and distal types of HMN were 2.3, 0.6, and 0.6/100,000 respectively. The segregation ratios, 0.26 for acute infantile HMN and 0.24 for chronic childhood HMN, suggested autosomal recessive inheritance. The consanguinity rates among parents of cases and the population did not differ significantly.\r"

  ".U": "89125354\r", 
  ".W": "Deterministic simulation models are used to show that HIV transmission dynamics in homosexual populations can be strongly affected by sexual partner selectiveness. The type of selectiveness or biased mixing examined is where individuals with similar new partnership formation rates are more likely to form a pair than would be expected by chance. The effect of such selectiveness could be strong even when the total number and distribution of new sexual partnerships and sex acts remains constant. This means that in order to predict the future course of HIV transmission and identify the populations at highest risk, we must have information not only on the frequency of new sexual partnerships and types of sex acts, but also on who has sex with whom. Given high sexual partner selectiveness, some groups of homosexuals with low rates of sex and new sex partners would take many decades before a single introduction would generate an epidemic. Epidemics in these groups can be markedly accelerated by only modest contact with higher risk groups. Even in very low activity groups, which if isolated would have no epidemic, an important proportion of their members can be infected when they are not selective. The relative risks of AIDS in groups making high numbers of new sexual partnerships compared to groups making low numbers are markedly affected by sexual partner selectiveness. The models developed were examined using information collected in 1984 from the Coping and Change Study in collaboration with the Chicago Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. This population was divided into activity groups by the rate at which individuals established new sexual partnerships and then a structure of new sexual partnerships between these activity groups was defined consistent with available data. Even without introducing any behavior change in the models, the proportion of the homosexual population infected was seen to level off temporarily at around 50% after several years as a consequence of saturation in the high risk groups when lower risk groups were not yet being consumed by the epidemic process. Most sex in the study population is casual or anonymous. The sample selection procedures were biased toward individuals who engage in such sex. There is, however, a large group of individuals that avoids the casual and anonymous sex scene. Simulated epidemics indicated that under a variety of conditions, the population that does not engage in casual and anonymous sex could experience an epidemic of HIV infection quite some time after the epidemic in the population that does has waned.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This violent patient frequently bit or scratched others, his mouth had blood and saliva, while his fingernails were at times soiled with semen, feces, and urine. He was HIV antibody and antigen positive. Although HIV was recovered from his peripheral blood lymphocytes, after 2.5 years of serial follow-up, all traumatized personnel were clinically normal, no HIV was cultured from their blood, and all were HIV antibody and P24 antigen negative. We conclude that this viremic AIDS patient, while producing copious amounts of body fluids, failed to infect those caring for him through bites and scratches. The risk of transmission of HIV through this route under similar conditions should be low.\r"

  ".W": "Intracerebral disease was diagnosed in 14 out of 450 patients who presented with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma between January 1976 and January 1987. Twelve of the 14 presented after June 1980. Age ranged from 31 to 73 years and eight patients were male. Two patients had other tumours, and three had relevant associated immunosuppressive disorders. Radiological assessment of one further patient showed a cavitating bronchial carcinoma. Five patients were untreated, and one died before radiotherapy was complete. Eight patients completed courses of whole-brain irradiation; four of these received higher doses. All entered remission. Three patients are alive, between eight months and seven years after treatment. Of the remaining five, one never recovered intellectual function and died of bronchopneumonia; three died between eight and 30 months after treatment and autopsy showed severe radionecrosis of the brain with no residual tumour. All three had received higher doses of radiation and had undergone burrhole aspiration before treatment. Autopsy was refused on one patient who also appeared to have died from radionecrosis of the brain. Immunohistological examination in eight cases confirms that cerebral non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a B-cell tumour. As other groups have found, its incidence appears to be rising. Survival rate is poor, and at least some deaths are related to both radiation necrosis and the bulk of residual tumour after diagnostic surgery.\r"

The diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia was based on observed abnormalities of ciliary ultrastructure or beating in vitro (beat pattern, beat frequency or percentage of motile cilia). Beat frequency and motility indices approached the normal range in some cases and suggests that the term 'immotile cilia syndrome' is not appropriate. Morphological abnormalities were most commonly due to deficiency of dynein arms, affecting the outer arms (n = 7), inner arms (n = 3) or both (n = 10). Examples of radial spoke and microtubular defects were also identified but in seven subjects ciliary ultrastructure was normal. In six patients paired samples of nasal and bronchial cilia were obtained and showed consistent abnormalities of motility and ultrastructure. Adenosine triphosphate and adenosine triphosphatase did not restore in vitro motility when added to dynein deficient cilia. The clinical picture was of life-long sinusitis and recurrent bronchial infection but the spectrum was broader than that encompassed by Kartagener's triad (dextrocardia, sinusitis and bronchiectasis). Fourteen patients had normal cardiac situs and definite or highly suggestive evidence of bronchiectasis was present in only 17 patients. Radiological evidence of sinusitis was common but absence of frontal sinuses was not universal. Chronic serous otitis media was a frequent finding but deafness was rarely profound. Fertility problems were common but were not universal in female subjects. Lung function testing revealed evidence of airflow obstruction but this was mild in most cases.\r"

Of the latter group two patients died from rebleeding, and the asymptomatic patient would not undergo surgery. The 16 operated patients underwent surgery after a delay ranging from 6 to 90 days after hemorrhage (25 days on average). The delayed surgery allowed the patients to be operated on in better neurological status: seven were graded I or Ia, six graded II, three graded III, and none graded IV. The results were excellent (with resumption of their previous activity) in 11 cases (69%), good (autonomous but with a slight deficit) in 4 cases (25%), and bad in 1 case (6%).

Although the incidence of both cerebral vasospasm and mortality was low in the patients who had cisternal drainage, the incidence of hydrocephalus was significantly higher in these patients. Drainage has been recommended as a useful procedure because it has been shown to improve the prognosis through prophylaxis and relief of vasospasm and removal of blood-contaminated cerebrospinal fluid. However, the results of this study indicate that extensive cerebrospinal fluid drainage may lead to hydrocephalus, which can be controlled by regulation of the drainage outflow and pressure.\r"

Three days after laser-sealed arteriotomy, no aneurysms were found, but in animals studied 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after laser-sealed arteriotomy, a 100% (17/17) aneurysm formation rate was achieved. Serial angiography did not demonstrate significant changes in size when performed at 2-week intervals, but angiography significantly underestimated true aneurysm size (p less than 0.001) as a function of increasing aneurysm diameter (p less than 0.001). By light-microscopic analysis, these aneurysms were similar to human cerebral saccular aneurysms. This saccular aneurysm model could be used to study various surgical and interventional radiology techniques in experimental animals.\r"

Computed tomography of the chest showed potentially inoperable tumour in 37 patients, of whom 25 had tumour confined to the chest. Three patients were shown to have malignant disease within the mediastinum and abdomen; five within the mediastinum and brain; and four within the mediastinum, abdomen, and brain. Computed tomography of the abdomen disclosed deposits in nine patients, but in only two were the abnormalities restricted to the abdomen. Computed tomography of the brain showed metastases in 10 patients, of whom only one had metastatic disease confined to the brain. Thus three patients had isolated deposits in the abdomen and brain. In 12 patients the identification of metastases in the abdomen and brain removed the need for mediastinoscopy. Preoperative computed tomography of the abdomen and brain detected occult metastases in 15 patients (13%) in this study. In three patients the extrathoracic abnormality proved the only contraindication to surgery, but in the other 12 it provided valuable corroborative evidence of incurability and facilitated the assessment of the mediastinal abnormality.\r"

Small volume washings, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsy, and bronchial brushings were carried out and fluid or tissue was sent for cytological or histological examination as appropriate. Of the 71 patients, 51 were subsequently shown to have malignant disease. In 38 of the patients the diagnosis of malignancy was made by bronchoscopy, from histological specimens alone or in conjunction with cytological specimens in 33, from brushings alone in two, and from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid alone in three patients. There were no important complications. Thus fibreoptic bronchoscopy in conjunction with fluoroscopic screening appears to be an effective and safe method for the initial investigation of a peripheral lung lesion more than 2 cm in diameter.\r"

In study 1 nasal resistance (posterior rhinomanometry) and specific airway resistance (sRaw) were measured before challenge and one, five, 10 and 30 minutes after four minutes of exhausting legwork exercise in nine asthmatic subjects and nine age matched healthy subjects. One minute after exercise there was a reduction in nasal resistance of 49% (SD 15%) from baseline in the healthy subjects and of 66% (17%) in the asthmatic subjects. This response and the subsequent return of nasal resistance to baseline values did not differ significantly between the two groups despite a substantial difference in the change in sRaw, an increase of 74% (45%) in the asthmatic subjects 10 minutes after exercise, and no change in the non-asthmatic subjects. In study 2, nasal and specific airway resistances were monitored according to the same measurement protocol in six subjects with increased airway reactivity. Subjects exercised on two occasions, wearing a noseclip, once while breathing cold, dry air and once while breathing warm, humid air. The fall in nasal resistance was similar under both conditions (to 47% and 39% of baseline), through sRaw rose only after cold air inhalation (to 172% of baseline). The results indicate that the nasal response to exercise is not related to bronchial obstruction in asthmatic subjects after exercise or to the temperature or humidity of the air inspired through the mouth during exercise.\r"

Alveolar macrophages from control subjects displayed a strong and homogeneous staining pattern and only 0.1% of cells were negative after staining. Macrophages from patients with sarcoidosis showed reduced TAcP activity and up to 7% of the cells were negative. The percentage of TAcP negative macrophages was correlated with the percentage of lymphocytes and with the ratio of CD4 to CD8 lymphocytes among cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage. The reduced TAcP activity in alveolar macrophages from patients with sarcoidosis may be due to an increased recruitment of immature precursors from blood.\r"

Many of these tests are terminated before dyspnoea occurs because of leg fatigue, arthritic pain, or claudication. A study was carried out to determine whether arm ergometry testing might serve as an alternative method to leg testing in eight patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. The patients had mild to moderate dyspnoea on exertion and required bronchodilator treatment. They had smoked an average of 62 pack years and had a mean FEV1 of 1.88 l. Arm and leg ergometry yielded similar levels of maximum ventilation (arm 47.2, leg 48.6 l/min), maximum heart rates (126 v 124 beats/min), maximum tidal volume (1.5 v 1.6 l), and respiratory rate (30 v 29 breaths/min); but maximum oxygen consumption (1120 v 966 ml/min), maximum power output (62 v 26 w), and oxygen pulse (9.1 v 7.8 ml/beat) were all higher with leg than with arm ergometry. In addition, ventilation and heart rate at a given level of oxygen consumption were higher for arm than for leg work during both submaximal and maximal exercise. It is concluded that arm ergometry offers an alternative testing method to leg testing in patients with moderate chronic obstructive lung disease.\r"

Before treatment mean (SD) FEV1 was 48% (16%) of the predicted value (% pred); the geometric mean concentration of methacholine required to produce a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was 0.44 (range 0.07-3.32) mg/ml; and TLCO was 59% (21%) predicted. The exponential constant (k) defining the shape of the static volume-pressure curve was 146% (66%) predicted and pulmonary conductance relative to predicted lung volume at a transpulmonary pressure of 5 cm H2O (sGL5) was 72% (37%) predicted. After prednisolone treatment (0.6 mg kg-1 day-1 for two weeks) FEV1 increased by 8% (19%) (p less than 0.05) and daily mean peak flow (PEF) by 3% (10%) (p less than 0.01) over pretreatment values. Three patients had an increase in FEV1 of more than 30%, two of whom had sputum eosinophilia (p less than 0.05). The three were among the 13 patients with a reduced sGL5. The increase in FEV1 did not correlate with initial PC20 (r = 0.16), k (r = -0.12), or TLCO (r = -0.14). Thus measurements of bronchial responsiveness, lung distensibility, and TLCO did not predict corticosteroid response in patients with stable chronic airflow obstruction. Patients with sputum eosinophilia or reduced pulmonary conductance may be more likely to respond.\r"
