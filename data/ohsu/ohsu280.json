However, it has been avoided in nonedematous patients because of concern for complications, including intravascular volume depletion. In this study, 12 nonedematous patients with chronic liver disease, portal hypertension and tense ascites underwent 14 large-volume (5-liter) paracenteses for the relief of discomfort and/or respiratory distress. Plasma volume was measured directly by a dilution method with 125I-labeled human serum albumin prior to and at 24 or 48 hr after 13 of the paracenteses. All patients felt better postparacentesis. No dizziness, hypotension, tachycardia, encephalopathy or change in mean serum sodium, creatinine or blood urea nitrogen occurred. Two patients experienced a decrease in hematocrit, which was not explained by blood loss or increase in plasma volume. Mean plasma volume was 3,713 +/- 129 ml (55.1 +/- 1.5 ml per kg ideal body weight) preparacentesis and 3,684 +/- 136 ml postparacentesis, the difference being -0.78% (p = 0.48, NS). Our results suggest that 5-liter paracentesis in nonedematous patients with tense portal hypertension-related ascites improves patient comfort and is not associated with a decrease in measured plasma volume.\r"

Intrahepatic pressure has been advocated by some as a simple and safe index of portal venous pressure. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability of intrahepatic pressure measurement and its relationship to portal venous pressure. Fifty patients requiring liver biopsy were included: 29 with cirrhosis (n = 20 micronodular, n = 9 macronodular) and 21 with various hepatic disorders but no cirrhosis. The procedure was performed under fluoroscopic guidance, using a Chiba needle connected to a manometer by a saline-filled catheter. Immediately prior to biopsy, each patient underwent measurement of: (i) 3 to 5 separate intrahepatic pressures, the intraparenchymal site being inferred by the lack of blood or bile return; and (ii) portal and hepatic venous pressures, the intravascular position of the needle being ascertained by the reflux of blood and the vessel identified with injection of contrast. Intrahepatic pressure measurements showed great intraindividual variability (variation coefficient up to 115%). Mean intrahepatic pressure (13.19 +/- 8.32 mm Hg) was similar to portal venous pressure (14.43 +/- 6.10 mm Hg) in the noncirrhotics but significantly lower in the cirrhotics (intrahepatic pressure = 18.34 +/- 8.82 mm Hg, portal venous pressure = 22.52 +/- 9.47 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). The difference between these two parameters exceeded 3 mm Hg in 50% of patients (mean = 9 mm Hg, range = 4 to 19 mm Hg), both in cirrhotics and noncirrhotics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The vasodilators were nonselective alpha-adrenergic antagonists (phentolamine, ifenprofil, isoxsuprine and buflomedil), a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol) and an agonist (isoproterenol), an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist (clonidine), calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem), nitrovasodilators (nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside), papaverine and other unclassified vasodilators, some of them with rheological properties (diazoxide, vincamine, cinepazide, naftidofuryl and pentoxifylline). The most potent drugs were ifenprofil, phentolamine, isoxsuprine, clonidine, sodium nitroprusside and buflomedil. Diazoxide, papaverine, pentoxifylline and trinitrine were less powerful. Verapamil, diltiazem, propranolol, isoproterenol, vincamine, cinepazide and naftidofuryl were ineffective. We conclude that different classes of pharmacological agents have significant vasodilatory properties on the hepatic microvasculature. This offers interesting perspectives in the treatment of cirrhosis and stressful states where high levels of circulating norepinephrine may contribute to the altered liver perfusion.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of ethanol on liver regeneration are poorly understood. Acute and chronic exposure to ethanol have been found to exert opposite effects on the induction of ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis. Polyamines are necessary for DNA synthesis and liver regeneration after chemical or surgical liver injury. Short-term exposure to ethanol, which inhibits ornithine decarboxylase has been shown to inhibit DNA synthesis and liver regeneration, whereas more chronic exposure to ethanol increases ornithine decarboxylase activity and therefore could conceivably stimulate DNA synthesis and regeneration. To explore this later possibility, the effects of chronic ethanol consumption on ornithine decarboxylase activity, DNA synthesis and liver regeneration were studied in rats after sham laparotomy and partial hepatectomy. Chronic ethanol feeding failed to inhibit the induction of ornithine decarboxylase that occurred after partial hepatectomy and yet significantly inhibited posthepatectomy DNA synthesis and restitution of liver mass. These data suggest that the induction of hepatic polyamine biosynthesis is dissociated from DNA synthesis and liver regeneration after chronic consumption of ethanol.\r"

Alcohol dehydrogenase immunoreactive protein and activity were increased in female and castrated rats as compared to normal male rats. By immunohistochemistry, alcohol dehydrogenase protein was found localized principally in the perivenous area of the hepatic lobule in all of the animals. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity eluted from the male rat liver, during bidirectional digitonin perfusion, exhibited a pattern characteristic of cytosolic enzymes predominantly localized to the perivenous area. The elution of the enzyme was more rapid during cava-porta than porta-cava perfusion occurring in close association with the elution of glucokinase, an enzyme localized principally in the perivenous area. By contrast, elution of lactate dehydrogenase, which is located predominantly in the periportal area, preceded elution of alcohol dehydrogenase during porta-cava perfusion, but followed it during cava-porta perfusion. These differences were less apparent in the cava-porta than in the porta-cava direction. The predominant localization of alcohol dehydrogenase immunoreactive protein and activity to the perivenous area of hepatic lobule was not affected by sexual difference or increase in the enzyme following castration.\r"

All of the compounds tested more or less affected the tissue levels of polyamines, including putrescine, spermidine, spermine and acetylpolyamines (N1-acetylspermidine and N1-acetylspermine). It was found that they were classified into two groups of substances: one group (including radical-producing drugs and lipopolysaccharide) which elevated the tissue levels of N1-acetylspermidine, especially in the liver, while another group of drugs (such as D-galactosamine and DL-ethionine) had little effect on the acetylpolyamine levels. When the acetylpolyamine levels rose, the levels of spermidine and spermine declined, and then putrescine levels were elevated. N1-Acetylspermine was detected only when N1-acetylspermidine levels were very high after treatment with radical-producing drugs and lipopolysaccharide. Halogenated carbon, such as carbon tetrachloride and halothane, elevated the levels of acetylpolyamines especially in the liver, while paraquat elevated them in all tissues examined.\r"

[3H]Retinoids were administered either orally, to make an inventory of the cell organelles involved, or intravenously as chylomicron remnant constituents to study retinoid processing by the liver with time. No qualitative differences were observed between the two routes of administration. Time-related changes in the distribution of grains were studied using chylomicron remnant [3H]retinoids. The percentages of grains observed over cells and the space of Disse at 5 and 30 min after administration were, respectively: parenchymal cells, 72.6 and 70.4%; fat-storing cells, 5.0 and 18.1%, and the space of Disse, 14.4 and 8.9%. Low numbers of grains were observed over endothelial and Kupffer cells. The percentages of grains observed over parenchymal cell organelles were, respectively: sinusoidal area, 59.6 and 34.4%; smooth endoplasmic reticulum associated with glycogen, 13.8 and 13.4%; mitochondria, 5.4 and 13.6%; rough endoplasmic reticulum, 4.2 and 7.3%, and rough endoplasmic reticulum associated with mitochondria, 3.7 and 6.5%. It is concluded that chylomicron remnant [3H]retinoids in combination with electron microscopic autoradiography provide a good system to study the liver processing of retinoids in vivo. These results, obtained in the intact liver under physiological conditions, further substantiate that retinoids are processed through parenchymal cells before storage occurs in fat-storing cell lipid droplets, that retinoid uptake is not mediated through lysosomes and that the endoplasmic reticulum is a major organelle in retinoid processing.\r"

The plasma levels of pipecolic acid, when compared to those in normal subjects (1.00 +/- 0.08 nmoles per ml), were found to be significantly elevated (p less than 0.01) in patients with liver cirrhosis (1.93 +/- 0.24 nmoles per ml) and hepatocellular carcinoma (2.22 +/- 0.49 nmoles per ml), but did not show any significant change in patients with chronic active hepatitis. Plasma levels of pipecolic acid correlated positively with serum bile acid and bilirubin, and negatively with indocyanine green disappearance rate, cholinesterase and prothrombin time but not with plasma lysine levels. These results suggest that plasma levels of pipecolic acid increase almost parallel to the severity of liver damage, and that this increase in pipecolic acid may reflect the injury of liver peroxisomes which appear to be related to the degradation of pipecolic acid.\r"

  ".W": "Autoantibodies against inner mitochondrial membrane proteins are a hallmark of primary biliary cirrhosis. Specifically, these antimitochondrial autoantibodies recognize two polypeptides of approximately 70 and 52 kD, respectively. Although the specificity of antimitochondrial autoantibodies has been studied for the past 2 decades, the complementary DNA encoding the major primary biliary cirrhosis-specific 70 kD antigen has only recently been cloned. The availability of the recombinant autoantigen has resulted in the development of a highly sensitive and specific ELISA to detect antimitochondrial autoantibodies and to determine their immunoglobulin isotypes. We report herein that IgG3 is the predominant isotype of antimitochondrial autoantibodies in a group of 74 primary biliary cirrhosis patients. This finding is significant in light of the genomic immunoglobulin in heavy chain gene arrangement. Ninety-three per cent of primary biliary cirrhosis patients possessed IgG3 antimitochondrial autoantibodies with titers of 1:10(3) or higher; 32% of these patients possessed titers of 10(4), 29% at 10(5) and 7% at 10(6). IgM antimitochondrial autoantibodies were next most prevalent; 63% of the patients were positive and 50% of these patients showed titers of 10(3), 43% at 10(4) and 6% at 10(5). Other isotypes were present but in much lower titer and occurrence. Isotypes of antimitochondrial autoantibodies reactive to the 52 kD antigen were also determined using immunoblotting techniques. The predominance of IgG3 and IgM were similarly observed. Finally, the serum immunoglobulin isotype levels of primary biliary cirrhosis patients were compared with healthy normal adults by radial immunodiffusion. Serum IgG3 and IgM were very elevated in primary biliary cirrhosis; with IgG3 at 5.5-fold and IgM at 4.3-fold above normals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88185990\r", 
  ".W": "Like the rat peritoneal macrophage, the isolated Kupffer cell is capable of processing and releasing iron acquired by phagocytosis of immunosensitized homologous red blood cells. When erythrophagocytosis is restrained to levels which do not affect cell viability, about one red cell per macrophage, close to 50% of iron acquired from red cells is released within 24 hr in the form of ferritin. Immunoradiometric assay of the extracellular medium indicates that 160 ng ferritin are released by 10(6) Kupffer cells after 24-hr incubation at 37 degrees C. Iron release is temperature-dependent, the rate at 37 degrees C being nearly 5-fold greater than at 4 degrees C. As estimated by sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation, ferritin released by the erythrophagocytosing Kupffer cell averages 2,400 iron atoms per molecule. When reincubated with isolated hepatocytes, this released ferritin is rapidly taken up by the cells. Via this process, hepatocytes may accumulate more than 160,000 iron atoms per cell per min. Such accumulation is not impeded by the presence of iron-loaded transferrin in the culture medium, but is markedly depressed by rat liver ferritin. In contrast to the conservation of transferrin during its interaction with hepatocytes, the protein shell of the ferritin molecule is rapidly degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments. Ferritin-mediated transfer of iron from Kupffer cells to hepatocytes may help explain the resistance of the liver to iron deficiency as well as the liver's susceptibility to iron overload.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate intercellular compartmentation of liver metabolism, we have recently introduced new procedures for quantitative assessment of metabolic liver cell heterogeneity both along sinusoids of portal and septal origins as well as at the level of the parenchymal unit, and also for three-dimensional imaging of enzyme and metabolite distribution. As part of the evaluation of the role of metabolic liver cell heterogeneity for the regulation of net substrate flux in the glucose-6-phosphatase/glucokinase system, and for the reduction of of these antagonistic enzymes, these techniques were used on livers from male rats. They served to obtain distribution data on glucose-6-phosphatase (the hydrolytic component of the glucose-6-phosphatase/glucokinase system) and its substrate, glucose-6-P, during the postresorptive phase (i.e., a metabolic state of net glucose release). Glucose-6-phosphatase (Vmax) and glucose-6-P were shown to decrease along the sinusoidal axis, and values of both parameters were significantly higher along sinusoids of portal than septal origin. Distribution of in vivo rates of glucose-6-P hydrolysis indicates the importance of metabolite distribution for in vivo regulation of liver cell function, insofar as it considerably increases the degree of heterogeneity among hepatocytes over that maximal rates of glucose formation. Histo- and microchemical data support the concept of a \"lobular parenchymal unit\" composed of \"primary lobules,\" and justify the conclusion that hepatocyte function, in addition to the hormonal and nutritional states of the animal, not only depends upon cell location along the sinusoidal axis, but also on the origin of sinusoids.\r"

The mechanism responsible for the phenobarbital increment in the rate of transcription of cytochrome P-450 b,e genes is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess whether active protein synthesis was needed for phenobarbital to induce the liver cytochrome P-450 b,e genes. Cycloheximide (2 mg per kg, i.p.) was administered 90 min prior to a single inductive dose of phenobarbital (80 mg per kg, i.p.) and mRNAS measured at 3, 6 and 12 hr by dot-blot hybridization. While phenobarbital increased cytochrome P-450 b,e mRNAs about 12-fold at 3 hr, this induction was abolished by cycloheximide. To define whether the absence of protein synthesis in hepatocytes inhibited the phenobarbital induction of cytochrome P-450 at the transcriptional level, in vitro transcription rates using isolated nuclei were measured. After phenobarbital administration, there was about a 20-fold increment in transcriptional rate of cytochrome P-450 b,e genes. This increment was abolished by prior injection of cycloheximide. It is proposed that either preexisting regulatory proteins or transacting factors dependent on active protein synthesis participate in the regulation of liver cytochrome P-450 b,e gene transcription after phenobarbital.\r"

  ".W": "The parameters which are important in causing changes in the T1 and T2 proton magnetic relaxation times of dogs bile were investigated. Three factors were found to be important in causing relaxation in bile: (i) total bile salt concentration; (ii) total protein concentration, and (iii) viscosity. The T1 and T2 values of hepatic and gallbladder biles were found to be independent of specific gravity, osmolarity and electrolyte concentrations. In vitro experiments were conducted with taurocholic acid, bovine serum albumin and porcine stomach mucin to examine the effects of intermolecular interactions on proton relaxation. Relative to each of the molecules alone, various combinations of the bile salt and proteins exhibit relaxation rates of 20 to 60% below theoretically expected values. This influence of in vitro molecular interactions on T1 and T2 is also likely to occur in hepatic and gallbladder biles in vivo. Thus, the effects of complex intermolecular interactions associated with the gallbladder microenvironment complicate but likely will not preclude direct assessment of physiologic data with magnetic resonance imaging.\r"

  ".W": "Nucleation-influencing activity was determined in T-tube bile samples derived from patients with obstructive jaundice. Since native T-tube bile samples do not nucleate, nucleation-influencing activity was determined by measuring the influence of T-tube bile on the nucleation time of model bile. In the assay, T-tube bile was mixed with model bile, and the nucleation time of this mixture was compared with the nucleation time of a model bile supplemented with the same amount of lipid as present in the bile sample. The results were expressed as ratio of the nucleation time of the mixture and the nucleation time of the control (NTm/NTc). There was a significant difference (p less than 0.01) between bile samples from patients with cholesterol gallstones and samples from patients with biliary obstruction due to other causes. More than 80% of the 33 samples from eight patients with stones were nucleation-promoting (NTm/NTc less than or equal to 0.6). Of the 40 bile samples from patients without stones, 7 were nucleation-promoting, 25 had no effect (NTm/NTc = 0.8 to 1.2) and 8 bile samples were nucleation-inhibiting (NTm/NTc greater than or equal to 1.4). There was no correlation between the lipid or protein content of a T-tube bile sample and its nucleation-influencing activity. The presence of both nucleation-promoting and nucleation-inhibiting activity in the same T-tube bile was demonstrated by chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose. More than 75% of the biliary protein did not bind to the column. This fraction showed nucleation-inhibiting activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88185999\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of side chain length on bile acid conjugation by human and rat liver fractions was examined. The rate of conjugation with glucuronic acid, sulfate and coenzyme A of several natural (C24) bile acids was compared with that of their corresponding nor-bile acids. The rate of coenzyme A ester formation by nor-bile acids was much lower than that of the natural bile acids. In human liver microsomes, the rate of coenzyme A formation was less than 8% of the rate for the corresponding C24 bile acid. Rat liver microsomes formed the coenzyme A ester of nor-bile acids less than 20% of the rate of their corresponding C24 homologs. Glucuronidation rates were greater than sulfation rates in both species. With human liver microsomes, nor-bile acids were glucuronidated more rapidly than their corresponding C24 homologs, whereas with rat liver microsomes the reverse was true. Purified 3 alpha-OH androgen UDP-glucuronyltransferase catalyzed the glucuronidation of both nor-bile acids and bile acids. Human liver cytosol sulfated nor-bile acids more slowly than the corresponding bile acids. Rat liver cytosol, however, sulfated nor-bile acids more rapidly than the corresponding bile acids. The highest rate was seen with lithocholylglycine. The results indicate that the novel biotransformation of nor-bile acids seen in vivo--sulfation and glucuronidation rather than amidation--is most likely explained as a consequent of defective amidation, to which the rate of coenzyme A formation contributes. Thus, side chain and nuclear structures as well as species differences in conjugating enzyme activity are determinants of the pattern of bile acid biotransformation by the mammalian liver.\r"

  ".W": "Bile acid synthesis is thought to be regulated by a negative feedback mechanism which is presumably dependent upon the flux of bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation. To characterize further the role of bile acids in regulation of bile acid synthesis, we have administered pure taurine or glycine conjugates of ursodeoxycholic acid or cholic acid to chronic bile fistula rats by continuous intraduodenal infusion, thus simulating restoration of the enterohepatic circulation. The effects of these bile salt infusions on bile acid synthesis, biliary cholesterol and phospholipid secretion and on the activities of the hepatic microsomal enzymes cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and HMG-CoA reductase were evaluated. Because the rate of biliary bile salt secretion in rats with intact exteriorized enterohepatic circulation averaged 27.1 +/- 1.4 mumoles per 100 gm rat per hr, infusion rates for bile fistula studies were chosen to match (24 to 36 mumoles per 100 gm rat per hr) or exceed (48 mumoles per 100 gm rat per hr) this physiological flux. Infusion of tauroursodeoxycholic acid for 48 hr at 24 and 48 mumoles per 100 gm rat per hr failed to suppress cholic acid synthesis. Bile flow and biliary cholesterol and phospholipid secretion exhibited small, dose-dependent increases with tauroursodeoxycholic acid infusions. No suppression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase or HMG-CoA reductase activity was observed. By contrast, taurocholic acid inhibited synthesis of chenodeoxycholate and its metabolites alpha- and beta-muricholate by 10% (NS), 66% (p less than 0.05) and 75% (p less than 0.05) at infusion rates of 24, 36 and 48 mumoles per 100 gm rat per hr, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pretreatment values of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity in patients' serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were not statistically different from values from control subjects. When interferon was administered, serum levels of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase began to rise within 3 hr, reached peak values at 12 hr and then declined. The levels of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity both in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased substantially during interferon treatment, ranging 2- to 50-fold greater than initial levels. The levels of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase in serum correlated closely with levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, when the levels of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase rose during interferon administration, serum hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase values fell, and, in some cases, DNA polymerase rose again when 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase fell after discontinuation of interferon. These findings suggest that 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity in serum accurately reflects the antiviral effect of interferon and could be used to monitor interferon treatment.\r"

Marmot No. 2 in the experimental group experienced an episode of seroconversion from woodchuck hepatitis surface antigen to anti-woodchuck hepatitis antibody. Woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA was detected, and woodchuck hepatitis surface antigen particles of both spherical and filamentous forms and intact woodchuck hepatitis virus virions were found in its serum. By contrast, none of the control group animals (receiving the negative pool) produced any marker of woodchuck hepatitis virus. This suggests that young Chinese marmots can get woodchuck hepatitis virus infection.\r"

All of the 18 children showed mild but definite liver histologic changes: 15 had nonspecific histologic changes, and three had chronic persistent hepatitis. In 13 of 18 children, follow-up aminotransferase activities were abnormal, but none exceeded 100 KU. At the time of biopsy, ALTs on four children were above the upper limit of normal. All children were HBeAg-positive in early infancy, but five lost this antigen and developed antibody during follow-up. The histologic findings in HBeAg-positive children did not differ from those in children with antibody. Perinatal hepatitis B virus infection has been thought to play an important role in chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma. This study indicates that some pathologic changes following perinatal infection begin very early.\r"

The majority (79%) of symptomatic children had histologically aggressive diseases: 11 had chronic active hepatitis and 10 had cirrhosis. In contrast, most asymptomatic children had nonaggressive diseases (35 cases); only 2 had chronic active hepatitis. Nine of the 10 children with cirrhosis were under 6 years of age, and the cirrhosis was often advanced, indicating that hepatitis B virus infection can cause the rapid development of cirrhosis in early life. HBcAg was present in 71% of 62 cases examined and correlated well with the status of HBeAg in serum. Cytoplasmic HBcAg was more frequently associated with aggressive disease than was nuclear HBcAg expression alone or no detectable HBcAg in the liver. A male predominance (75%) was found, particularly in children with aggressive diseases (91%) compared to those with nonaggressive forms of disease (67%). Sera from mothers of 43 of these children were tested for HBsAg, and 51% were positive. HBsAg was particularly common among mothers of children with symptomatic disease (69%) or cirrhosis (100%). These findings suggest that male sex and perinatal infection are important factors in the development of overt chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis in children.\r"

To explore these tenets, we examined several aspects of cellular Na+ homeostasis in serially passed, cultured skin fibroblasts from 30 subjects (15 hypertensive blacks and whites and normotensive subjects matched for sex, age, and race.) Fibroblasts from blacks demonstrated higher cellular Na+ turnover rates than did those from whites. This difference was expressed by accelerated Na+-K+ pump activity (ouabain-sensitive Na+ washout rate, 3.46 +/- 0.216 for blacks vs 1.84 +/- 0.283 mEq/L/min for whites; p = 0.0006) and a higher rate of cellular accumulation of Na+ in the presence of ouabain (0.964 +/- 0.0743 vs 0.562 +/- 0.0440 mEq/L/min for blacks and whites, respectively; p = 0.0045). Associated with these findings, fibroblasts from blacks had higher cellular Na+ concentration than did those from whites (9.78 +/- 0.512 vs 7.50 +/- 0.400 mEq/L; p = 0.0170, as measured by atomic absorption, and 7.84 +/- 0.470 vs 5.03 +/- 0.980 mEq/L; p = 0.0141, as derived from the equilibrium distribution ratio of 22Na+). It is concluded that blacks differ from whites with respect to cellular Na+ turnover rate, which is evidenced by an increased Na+ influx and accelerated Na+-K+ pump activity in their fibroblasts. Our findings support the tenet that innate racial differences in cellular Na+ regulation may underlie the predisposition of blacks to hypertension.\r"

Results indicated greater heart rate and blood pressure reactivity among black children than among white children. Thus, the previous results were replicated.

To determine whether the increased forearm vascular resistance observed following vasodilator maneuvers in hypertensive patients is predominantly due to structural or to functional changes, we examined the influence of different vasodilator stimuli on forearm blood flow and blood pressure in 22 male patients with established essential hypertension and in 22 age-matched normotensive men (age range, 28-52 years). Blood pressure was measured directly, and blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. The maneuvers applied were 1) arterial occlusion combined with handgrip exercise and local heating, 2) intra-arterial infusion of the calcium entry blocker nifedipine, 3) intra-arterial infusion of the nonspecific vasodilator sodium nitroprusside, 4) arterial occlusion initiated after intra-arterial infusion of nifedipine. Vascular resistance during vasodilation induced by arterial occlusion or infusion of nifedipine or sodium nitroprusside remained significantly higher in the hypertensive than in the normotensive subjects. However, the maximal vasodilation achieved by the combination of arterial occlusion and nifedipine resulted in a similar resistance in both groups (1.6 +/- 0.2 in the hypertensive vs 1.4 +/- 0.2 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml tissue in the normotensive subjects. These data suggest that there is an important functional component of the elevated resistance in patients with essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The responsiveness of central nervous system alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the neural control of renal function was compared in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) on normal or high sodium intake (3-4 weeks of 1% NaCl for drinking). The responsiveness of central alpha 2-adrenergic receptors was determined by comparing among groups the dose-response curves for the effects of cumulative intracerebroventricular injections of guanabenz (5, 25, and 125 micrograms) on changes in mean arterial pressure, renal sympathetic nerve activity, and urinary sodium excretion. Guanabenz altered mean arterial pressure similarly in SHR on normal or high sodium intake and in WKY on normal or high sodium intake. High sodium intake shifted the guanabenz-renal sympathetic nerve activity and guanabenz-urinary sodium excretion dose-response curves to the left in SHR and to the right in WKY. The dose-response curves between SHR and WKY on normal sodium intake were similar. Surgical renal denervation or pretreatment with an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist (rauwolscine, 30 micrograms i.c.v.) attenuated the ability of guanabenz to inhibit renal sympathetic nerve activity or increase urinary sodium excretion in SHR and WKY on either normal or high sodium intake. We conclude that the responsiveness of central nervous system alpha 2-adrenergic receptors regarding the neural control of renal function is increased by high sodium intake in conscious SHR, but not in conscious normotensive WKY.\r"

Air stress increased renal sympathetic nerve activity and decreased urine flow rate and urinary sodium excretion in conscious Dahl rats on a high sodium diet, but it had no effect in rats on a low sodium diet. Mean arterial pressure did not change during air stress in any group. Renal denervation prevented the antidiuretic and antinatriuretic responses to air stress in DS and DR on a high NaCl diet. An increased renal tubular reabsorption of sodium and water appeared to mediate the antinatriuretic and antidiuretic responses to air stress, since glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were unchanged. Thus, environmental stress increases renal sympathetic nerve activity and decreases urinary sodium excretion more in Dahl rats on a high NaCl diet than on a low NaCl diet. On a high NaCl diet, these responses are greater in DS than in DR.\r"

Four and 20 weeks later, with the rats under ether anesthesia, peak cardiac output and stroke volume were measured during volume loading and peak left ventricular developed pressure and maximum rate of rise of pressure (dP/dtmax) were determined during aortic occlusion. Additionally, passive pressure-volume relations were obtained during saline infusion in potassium-arrested hearts, and the chamber stiffness constant was derived from one exponential function. There was a mortality of 16.1% in the diabetic SHR only. While basal and stressed cardiac performance was unchanged despite the already decreased mean arterial pressure and left ventricular weight at 4 weeks, the diabetic SHR revealed significant decreases in peak cardiac pumping indexes, peak left ventricular developed pressure, and dP/dtmax, with unchanged resting cardiac function, at 20 weeks. Changes seen in the diabetic WKY were reduced left ventricular weight at 4 weeks and reduced peak left ventricular dP/dtmax at 20 weeks. The chamber stiffness was unaltered with strain or diabetes. These data show that imposition of even moderate diabetes substantially influences the stress-loaded in vivo cardiac performance in the SHR, whereas it produces only minor changes in the WKY.\r"

  ".W": "The role of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation in the regulation of systemic vascular capacity and venous return, a major determinant of cardiac output, is not well understood. With the influence of the central nervous system isolated from the systemic circulation, the direct peripheral vascular effects of two specific, chemically distinct alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists, UK 14,304 and B-HT 920, were investigated in 19 dogs on total cardiopulmonary bypass with constant arterial perfusion and central venous pressure. Five-minute intra-arterial infusions of UK 14,304 (200 micrograms/min) resulted in increased arterial resistance (mean arterial pressure increased 18 +/- 4 [SEM] mm Hg; p less than 0.01) and a decrease in systemic vascular capacity (81 +/- 20 ml; p less than 0.01). This decrease in systemic vascular capacity appears to result from vasoconstriction, since there was no decrease in transhepatic resistance to portal flow and no significant change in hepatic vein flow to suggest redistribution of arterial blood flow. Yohimbine abolished both the arterial and systemic capacity effects, whereas prazosin did not. Intra-arterial administration of B-HT 920 (200 theta grams/min) in five dogs produced similar changes in arterial resistance and systemic capacity. These findings provide direct evidence for beta 2-adrenergic control, not only of arterial resistance but also of systemic vascular capacity, which in the intact animal would increase venous return to the heart.\r"

To find a more sensitive method, we applied the principle of differentiated impedance (dZ/dt) to the tail-cuff measurement of systolic blood pressure. We obtained clear pulse signals from the tail in awake rats without preheating the animals, and the systolic blood pressure obtained by this method had an excellent correlation with the directly measured femoral artery pressure (correlation coefficient = 0.98). Heating the animals at 40 degrees C for 5 minutes increased systolic blood pressure by a mean of 6 mm Hg as compared with that determined at the ambient temperature of 21 to 24 degrees C. Mean systolic blood pressure in young female diabetic rats was 122 +/- 3 mm Hg, which was significantly higher than the 111 +/- 2 mm Hg of normal rats. It is concluded that the technique of electrical impedance as applied to the tail-cuff method is simple and highly sensitive and is suitable for measurement of tail systolic blood pressure in awake rats without preheating.\r"

  ".U": "88186125\r", 
  ".W": "In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the progression (or absence of regression) of cardiac hypertrophy despite adequate blood pressure (BP) control by arterial vasodilators has been attributed to increased cardiac sympathetic activity. We evaluated changes in indices of general and cardiac sympathetic tone in relation to changes in cardiac anatomy during treatment of normotensive rats and SHR with hydralazine, 120 mg/L, or minoxidil, 120 mg/L of drinking water. In SHR, both vasodilators reduced BP rapidly and consistently. Significant increases in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine were observed only in the initial 2 days of arterial vasodilator treatment. After 5 weeks of treatment, marked increases in left and right ventricular sympathetic activity (as assessed by norepinephrine turnover rates) were present, but no increase was seen in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine. Intravascular volume expansion was observed on Day 14 of minoxidil and Day 35 of hydralazine treatment. Prolonged treatment with minoxidil induced significant increases in left ventricular internal diameter, as well as in left and right ventricular weights, but not in the wall thickness of the left ventricle. Treatment with hydralazine did not affect left ventricular weight and caused a small increase in the weight of the right ventricle. In normotensive rats, both vasodilators initially decreased BP, but tolerance developed within 1 to 2 weeks of treatment. Plasma norepinephrine and heart rate showed increases only at Day 1 of either treatment, whereas cardiac sympathetic hyperactivity persisted at 2 and 5 weeks of treatment. Changes in cardiac anatomy were qualitatively similar to those observed in SHR. We conclude that, during treatment of normotensive rats and SHR with arterial vasodilators, cardiac sympathetic hyperactivity persists and may be involved in the cardiac effects of arterial vasodilators. However, other mechanisms, such as chronic cardiac volume overload, may also play an important role, particularly with minoxidil.\r"

Hypothalamic contents of pyridoxal phosphate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and serotonin in the pyridoxine-deficient rats were significantly lower than those in pyridoxine-supplemented controls. Hypertension was associated with sympathetic stimulation. Treatment of pyridoxine-deficient rats with a single dose of pyridoxine (10 mg/kg body weight) reversed the blood pressure to normal levels within 24 hours, with concomitant restorations of hypothalamic serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid as well as the return of plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine to normal levels. Also, pyridoxine treatment reversed the hypothalamic hypothyroidism observed in pyridoxine-deficient rats. These results indicate an association between pyridoxine deficiency and sympathetic stimulation leading to hypertension.\r"

A liquid-filled capsule was implanted into a rib to measure pleural liquid pressure with minimal distortion of the pleural space (Wiener-Kronish et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 59: 597-602, 1985). Capsule position relative to lung height was measured from thoracic radiographs taken in each position. In each body position, pleural liquid pressure was most negative in the superior lung regions and least negative in the inferior lung regions. In the supine position, the magnitude of the vertical gradient in pleural liquid pressure was 0.67 cmH2O/cm ht and was not significantly different from 1 cmH2O/cm ht. In the inferior lung regions (less than 50% lung ht), pleural liquid pressure averaged -1.3 cmH2O, indicating a low transpulmonary pressure over the region of the chest where most of the lung mass is located. When animals were in the prone position, the magnitude of the vertical gradient in pleural liquid pressure was 0.14 cmH2O/cm ht and was not statistically different from 0 cmH2O/cm ht. In each body position, mean transpulmonary pressure, measured postmortem, was similar to the estimated magnitude of pleural liquid pressure at 50% lung ht. This suggests that pleural liquid pressure is closely related to pleural surface pressure. These results are consistent with the poor ventilation distribution and reduced lung volumes measured in anesthetized horses in the supine position compared with values measured in horses in the prone position.\r"

Blood flows were measured using labeled microspheres before exercise and at 0.5, 15, and 30 min of fast treadmill walking at 15 m/min. An initial infusion of ADA (1,000 U/kg) was given 30 min before the first blood flow measurement and a second injection (1,000 U/kg) was given 5 min into exercise. These infusions maintained ADA activity above 5 U/ml blood throughout the experimental period. This plasma concentration of ADA was shown to be sufficient to result in a 64% decrease in muscle adenosine levels during ischemic contraction. Blood flows were measured in all of the muscles of the hindlimb (28 samples) and in various nonmuscular tissues in ADA-treated and control rats. Preexercise blood flows were primarily directed to slow-twitch muscles and exercise blood flows were highest in muscles with fast-twitch oxidative fibers. ADA treatment did not reduce total muscle blood flow or exercise blood flows in any of the muscles at any time. These findings do not support the hypothesis that adenosine plays an essential role in controlling muscle blood flow in skeletal muscles during normal locomotor activity.\r"

Total glutathione, glucose, pyruvate, and lactate concentrations and L/P did not change significantly during sustained exercise. During recovery, GSH and GSH/GSSG increased from exercise levels and significantly overshot preexercise levels, reaching maximum values after 3 days. Oxidation of GSH during submaximal exercise and its reduction in recovery suggest increased formation of active O2-. species in blood during physical exercise in moderately trained males.\r"

Very little of the labeled rabbit surfactant phosphatidylcholine lost from the lungs could be recovered in other organs, and 90% of the recovered labeled phosphatidylcholine in the liver was unsaturated, implying de novo synthesis using precursors from degraded phosphatidylcholine.

Resulting estimates of efficiency and stress indicate that the circularly arranged obliquely striated muscles in squid mantle produce maximum tensions about half those of vertebrate cross-striated muscle, that \"anaerobic\" fibers contribute to aerobic swimming, and that peak pressure production requires an instantaneous power output higher than is thought possible for muscle. Radial muscles probably contribute additional energy via elastic storage in circular collagen fibers. Although higher rates of aerobic power consumption are only found in terrestrial animals at much higher temperatures, the constraint on squid performance is circulation, not ventilation. Anaerobic power consumption is also among the highest ever measured, but the division of labor between \"aerobic\" and \"anaerobic\" fibers suggests a system designed to optimize the limited capacity of the circulation.\r"

We also addressed the questions of what affects active expiration during exercise. Exercise effects on EELV were determined by a He-dilution technique and verified by changes in end-expiratory esophageal pressure. We also used abdominal pressure-volume loops to determine active expiration. EELV was reduced with increasing exercise intensity. EELV was reduced significantly during even mild steady-state exercise and during heavy exercise decreased an average of 0.71 +/- 0.3 liter. Dynamic lung compliance was reduced 30-50%; EELV remained greater than closing volume. Changing the resistance to airflow (via SF6-O2 or He-O2 breathing) during steady-state exercise changed the peak gastric and esophageal pressure generation during expiration but did not alter EELV; breathing through the mouthpiece produced similar effects during exercise. EELV was significantly reduced in the supine position. With supine exercise active expiration was not elicited, and EELV remained the same as in supine rest. With CO2-driven hyperpnea (7-70 l/min), EELV remained unchanged from resting levels, whereas during exercise, at similar minute ventilation (VE) values EELV was consistently decreased. At the same VE, treadmill running caused an increase in tonic gastric pressure and greater reductions in EELV than either walking or cycling. We conclude that both the exercise stimulus and the resultant hyperpnea stimulate active expiration and a reduced FRC. This new EELV is preserved in the face of moderate changes in mechanical time constants of the lung. This reduced EELV during exercise aids inspiration by optimizing diaphragmatic length and permitting elastic recoil of the chest wall.\r"

Studies done 8 wk after the injections showed that final body weight, lung dry weight, lung DNA content, and air and saline lung volumes were significantly lower in both young and adult diabetic rats compared with the controls. In young diabetic rats, volume-pressure (V-P) curves expressed as percent maximal lung volume (%MLV) were shifted downward and to the right of those in young control rats at 5 cmH2O transpulmonary pressure (PL) for air and at 4, 6, and 8 cmH2O PL for saline-filled lungs; specific lung compliance (CL) values obtained from both air and saline V-P curves were significantly reduced, and concentration of hydroxyproline relative to DNA was significantly increased. In adult diabetic rats, V-P curves expressed in %MLV, CL values, and concentrations of protein and hydroxyproline were similar to those in adult control rats. We conclude that in both young and adult rats, diabetic state leads to somatic and lung growth retardation. In addition in young diabetic rats lung distensibility is decreased.

Changes in PVR were assessed using the arterial and venous occlusion technique and the vascular pressure-flow relationship. Changes in alveolar surface tension were confirmed from measurements of pulmonary compliance as well as from measurements of surface tension of extracts from lung homogenates. After surfactant depletion (the perfusion rate constant) the total pressure gradient (delta PT) across the lobe increased from 13.4 +/- 1 to 17.1 +/- 0.8 mmHg. This increase in delta PT was associated with a significant increase in the arterial and venous gradients (3.7 +/- 0.3 to 4.9 +/- 0.4 and 5.7 +/- 0.5 to 9.4 +/- 0.6 mmHg, respectively) and a decrease in middle pressure gradient (4.1 +/- 0.8 to 2.9 +/- 0.6 mmHg). The vascular pressure-flow relationship supported these findings and showed that the mean slope increased by 52% (P less than 0.05), whereas the pressure intercept decreased slightly but not significantly (3.7 +/- 0.7 to 3.2 +/- 0.8 mmHg). These results suggest that the resistance of arteries and veins increases, whereas the resistance of the middle segment decreases after surfactant depletion. These effects were apparently due to surface tension that acts directly on the capillary wall. Direct visualization of subpleural capillaries supported the notion that capillaries become distended and recruited as alveolar surface tension increases. In the normal lung (perfused at constant-flow rate) changes in alveolar pressure (Palv) were transmitted fully to the capillaries as suggested by equal changes in pulmonary arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined maximum expiratory flow (Vmax) in two canine preparations in which regional changes in lung mechanical properties were produced. In one experiment serial bronchial obstructions were made to determine whether flow-limiting sites (choke points, CP) would occur in series. With the right lung tied off, constrictions were placed at the left lower lobar bronchus (LLL) and left main-stem bronchus. On deflation from total lung capacity, the obstructed LLL and nonobstructed left upper lobe (LUL) emptied into the obstructed left main-stem bronchus. Although a CP common to both lobes was identified at the main-stem obstruction, which limited total Vmax, we questioned whether there was also a CP at the lobar obstruction that fixed LLL flow. In that case the rate of LLL emptying would not be dependent on the presence of the common (i.e., central) CP and thus the flow contribution of the LUL. We found that when the LUL was removed, the LLL increased its rate of emptying. Thus a lobar CP did not fix LLL flow and CP did not occur in series. In a second experiment emphysema was produced in the left lung to reduce lung recoil, whereas the right lung was normal. CP were identified at approximately lobar bronchi of each lung, and the lungs were emptied at different rates. A CP common to both lungs was not identified. Our results indicate that in localized lung disease, if flows from the different regions are high enough, then wave speed is reached in proximal airways, and a CP occurs centrally rather than peripherally. On the other hand, if flows are low, then wave speed is reached peripherally and a CP common to all lung regions does not occur.\r"

  ".W": "To facilitate the study of respiratory wheezes in an animal lung model, an isovolume, constant-flow excised dog lung preparation was developed. Dog lungs were inflated to 26 +/- 4 cmH2O and coated with layers of epoxy glue and polyester compound. A rigid shell 2 mm thick was obtained around the entire pleural surface and the extra-pulmonary airways. The adhesive forces between the pleura and the shell were strong enough to hold the lung distended after the inflation pressure was removed. Holes 2 mm diam were drilled through the shell over one of the lung lobes in an array, 4 cm across. The holes penetrated the pleural surface, so that constant flow could be maintained in the expiratory direction by activating a suction pump connected to the trachea. Downstream suction pressure and flow rate were measured with a mercury manometer and a rotameter, respectively. Sounds were recorded by a small (0.6 cm OD) microphone inserted into the trachea. When suction pressure was increased, flow initially increased to 31 +/- 3 l/min. Further increase of suction pressure caused only very slight additional increase in flow (i.e., flow limitation). During this plateau of flow, a pure tone was generated with acoustic properties similar to respiratory wheezes. Both the flow plateau and the wheezing sounds could be eliminated by freezing the lungs. It is concluded that wheezing sounds were associated with flow limitation in this preparation. It is suggested that the stable acoustic properties obtained by this preparation may become useful in the analysis of mechanisms of wheezing lung sounds generation.\r"

  ".W": "Sublethal inhibition of citrate metabolism in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with monofluoroacetate (MFA) has been shown to cause a fivefold increase in myocardial blood flow without any change in cardiac output, blood pressure, or O2 consumption (C. Liang, J. Clin. Invest. 60: 61-69, 1977); however, blood flow did not increase to any organs examined other than the heart, including resting limb skeletal muscle. Preferential inhibition of glycolysis with iodoacetate (IA) failed to cause similar changes in distribution of blood flow. This unique response of myocardium to TCA cycle inhibition suggested a unique metabolic control of cardiac vasodilation. An alternate explanation is that MFA is preferentially concentrated in active muscle. After MFA, tissue citrate accumulates behind the block and the highest levels are reported in the heart and diaphragm, suggesting enhanced blockade or enhanced compensation in these two continuously active muscles. To test the hypothesis that vasodilation in the heart after MFA is not unique and that similar vasodilation will be evoked in active respiratory muscles, we measured blood flow to the myocardium, kidney, diaphragm, intercostals, transverse abdominals, and triceps brachii in anesthetized dogs using radionuclide-labeled microspheres, before and after MFA, and in another set of dogs before and after IA. Before MFA or IA, inspiratory loading significantly increased blood flow to active muscles of breathing in proportion to the added load. After MFA, blood flow to active muscles of breathing as well as to the heart became abnormally elevated with respect to mechanical work, and loading evoked no further increase in blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four groups of rats were exposed for 550 min to O2 at 1.67, 1.90, and 2.15 ATA and to air at 1.90 ATA, respectively. Ventilatory parameters (frequency, tidal volume, and minute ventilation) were measured using whole-body plethysmography, before the hyperbaric exposure, immediately after the exposure, and up to 20 days after the exposure. Resting ventilation was not affected after exposure at 1.90 ATA to air or at 1.67 ATA to O2. HBO at 1.90 and 2.15 ATA caused a reduction of frequency and an elevation of tidal volume at different inspired gases: air, 5% CO2 balance O2, 80% O2, and 4.5% O2. However, minute ventilation on the day after the hyperoxic exposure was not different from the control at either air, 5% CO2, or 80% O2 but was markedly attenuated on the first three breaths at 4.5% O2. The hypoxic ventilation decreased to 48 +/- 13 (SD) and 32 + 11% after 1.90 and 2.15 ATA, respectively. The ventilatory parameters recovered in the days after HBO. We conclude that HBO reversibly depresses the hypoxic ventilatory drive, most probably by a direct effect on the carotid O2 chemoreceptors.\r"

The nitrogen balance data revealed that bodybuilders required 1.12 times and endurance athletes required 1.67 times more daily protein than sedentary controls. Lean body mass (density) was maintained in bodybuilders consuming 1.05 g protein.kg-1.day-1. Endurance athletes excreted more total daily urea than either bodybuilders or controls. We conclude that bodybuilders during habitual training require a daily protein intake only slightly greater than that for sedentary individuals in the maintenance of lean body mass and that endurance athletes require daily protein intakes greater than either bodybuilders or sedentary individuals to meet the needs of protein catabolism during exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of posture on the mechanics of the respiratory system are not well known, particularly in terms of total respiratory resistance. We have measured respiratory impedance (Zrs) by the forced random noise excitation technique in the sitting and the supine position in 24 healthy subjects. Spirometry and lung volumes (He-dilution technique) were also measured in both postures. The equivalent resistance (Rrs), compliance (Crs), and inertance (Irs) were also calculated by fitting each measured Zrs to a linear series model. When subjects changed from sitting to the supine position, the real part of Zrs increased over the whole frequency band. The associated equivalent resistance, Rrs, increased by 28.2%. The reactance decreased for frequencies lower than 18 Hz and increased for higher frequencies. Consequently, Crs decreased by 38.7% and Irs increased by 15.6%. All of these parameter differences were significant (P less than 0.001). A covariance analysis showed that a significant amount of the postural change in Rrs and Crs can be explained by the reduction of functional residual capacity (FRC). This indicates that the observed differences on Zrs can in part be explained be a shift of the operating point of the respiratory system induced by the decrease in the FRC.\r"

Analysis of competitive displacement of ([3H]NMS binding by pirenzepine demonstrated the presence of M1- (27 +/- 2%) and M2G- (73 +/- 2%) receptors on isolated tracheal submucosal gland cells (TSGC's) in control. Daily administration of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) inhibited cholinesterase activity by greater than 95%. After 7 days of DFP treatment, [3H]QNB binding to intact TSGC's decreased from 14.2 +/- 0.6 to 6.3 +/- 0.8 fmol/10(6) cells; similarly, [3H]NMS binding fell from 8.1 +/- 1.9 to 2.0 +/- 0.8 fmol/10(6) cells. The loss of mAChR's was predominantly of the M2G subtype with the relative proportion dropping to 33%. In addition, 90% of the receptors assumed the high-affinity state for carbachol displacement of [3H]NMS. Mucus secretion was quantitated by measuring the release of 3H-labeled mucus macromolecules from explants of tracheal submucosal glands and isolated cells. Acetylcholine (ACh), 2 X 10(-5) M, stimulated mucus secretion by 2.5 and 2.3 times the basal rate, respectively. Elimination of acetylcholinesterase (AChe) by DFP increased the ACh sensitivity by 18- and 5-fold. Tracheal explants or TSGC's obtained 2 h after an in vivo DFP treatment showed a 6- and 3-fold ACh stimulation. This ACh sensitivity decreased during the continued daily dosing with DFP such that only a 1.3- and 1.1-fold ACh stimulation was apparent after 7 days of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cutaneous blood flow (CBF) was estimated indirectly from the heating power of the electrode (HP) and with an 8-MHz bidirectional ultrasonic probe by Doppler shift in a fingertip at 45 degrees C (DF). Blood flow was regulated by an upper arm cuff. Mean transcutaneous PO2 during air respiration was 86.0 +/- 6.2 Torr, and the correlation to arterial PO2 (Pao2) was 0.96 at normal blood flow. The arterial inflow was intermittently reduced in 10-15% stages of effective perfusion pressure (Peff). There was a hyperbolic decrease in PO2 when CBF was restricted in stages. A linear dependence between Peff, HP, and DF was found, which means that there is no autoregulation in the capillary bed at 45 degrees C. Transcutaneous PO2 can be also taken as an indication of CBF. The transcutaneous index, transcutaneous PO2/Pao2, is helpful for estimating local O2 availability.\r"

We evaluated the efficacy of antihistamines to determine the physiological role of histamine in canine anaphylaxis. Either a saline vehicle (control group), an H1 antihistamine (chlorpheniramine, 10 mg/kg), or this H1 antihistamine and an H2 antihistamine (cimetidine, 30 mg/kg) was administered to three separate groups of anesthetized dogs (n = 8). Cardiopulmonary responses and plasma histamine levels were measured after the separate intravenous injection of Ascaris suum antigen and histamine. Results were analyzed only from the animals demonstrating physiological responses or histamine release after antigen injection. In the control group, antigen produced a 43 +/- 15% (mean +/- SE) decrease in mean arterial blood pressure, a 34 +/- 13% fall in cardiac output, and a 19 +/- 9% decrease in lung compliance, whereas pulmonary vascular resistance increased 161 +/- 87% and airway resistance rose 114 +/- 66%. Similar physiological abnormalities were observed with histamine shock. However, peak plasma histamine levels were, in most cases, greater after histamine injection than after antigen injection. An H1 antihistamine alone or in combination with an H2 antihistamine did not alter the physiological changes associated with systemic anaphylaxis. In contrast, the combined use of H1 and H2 antihistamines prevented the cardiopulmonary responses associated with the intravenous administration of histamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We therefore studied 18 adult patients with congenital (16) or noncongenital (2) right-to-left shunts and a group of normal control subjects during constant work rate and progressive work rate exercise to assess the effects of these alterations on the dynamics of exercise ventilation and gas exchange. Minute ventilation (VE) was significantly higher in the patients than in the controls, both at rest (10.7 +/- 2.4 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.2 l/min, respectively) and during constant-load exercise (24.9 +/- 4.8 vs. 12.7 +/- 2.61 l/min, respectively). When beginning constant work rate exercise from rest, the ventilatory response of the patients followed a pattern that was distinct from that of the normal subjects. At the onset of exercise, the patients' end-tidal PCO2 decreased, end-tidal PO2 increased, and gas exchange ratio increased, indicating that pulmonary blood was hyperventilated relative to the resting state. However, arterial blood gases, in six patients in which they were measured, revealed that despite the large VE response to exercise, arterial pH and PCO2 were not significantly different from resting values when sampled during the first 2 min of moderate-intensity exercise. Arterial PCO2 changed by an average of only 1.4 Torr after 4.5-6 min of exercise. Thus the exercise-induced alveolar and pulmonary capillary hypocapnia was of an appropriate degree to compensate for the shunting of CO2-rich venous blood into the systemic arterial circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We observed that under both hypoxic hypobaria and normoxic hypobaria, lung lymph flow (Qlym) significantly increased from the base-line values of 6.4 +/- 0.3 to 13.0 +/- 1.0 ml/h and 6.0 +/- 0.2 to 9.4 +/- 0.3 ml/h, respectively (P less than 0.05) and that the lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio remained unchanged. Moreover, pretreatment with a 2-h denitrogenation inhibited the increase in Qlym. These results suggest that rapid exposure to hypobaria causes an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability and that intravascular air bubble formation may account for this permeability change.\r"

VO2max of the trained runners was in the good or above range based on their age and that of the sedentary subjects was average or below.

When subjects consumed self-chosen diets, basal urinary Cr excretion of the trained subjects was also significantly lower than that of the untrained subjects. Daily urinary Cr excretion of trained subjects was significantly higher on the day of a single exercise bout at 90% VO2max compared with nonexercise days, 0.12 +/- 0.02 and 0.09 +/- 0.01 microgram/day, respectively. Urinary Cr excretion of sedentary subjects was not altered after controlled exercise. These data demonstrate that basal urinary Cr excretion and excretion in response to exercise are related to VO2max and therefore degree of physical fitness.\r"

We studied the effects of several modes of metabolic inhibition on the bioelectric properties and solute permeability of dog bronchial epithelium mounted in Ussing chambers. Net Na+ absorption and short-circuit current were inhibited by approximately 75% by hypoxia or by 10(-3) M NaCN. The reduced net Na+ absorption was characterized by a decrease in absorptive flux and an increase in backflux. The latter change was proportional to an increase in permeability to [14C]mannitol, implying that solute flow through a paracellular shunt was increased. In contrast, the reduction of conductance expected from exposure to amiloride (0.94 +/- 0.15 ms/cm2 or 12%) was abolished by NaCN pretreatment. Metabolic inhibition also decreased epithelial conductance and unidirectional Cl- fluxes by approximately 25%. NaCN rapidly and reversibly inhibited the hyperpolarization of potential difference (PD) induced by low luminal bath [Cl-]. This effect was mimicked by the Cl- channel blocker, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid. Because the transepithelial Cl- diffusion PD reflects, in part, the depolarization of the Cl- -conductive apical cell membrane, metabolic inhibition appears to affect this path. We conclude that metabolic inhibition not only decreased net ion transport by dog bronchial epithelium but also inhibited cellular Na+- and Cl- -conductive pathways and increased paracellular permeability.\r"

These values were also compared with untrained age-matched control animals. The animals, which were 10 or 24 mo old after 6 mo of training, were fasted for 24 h before they were killed. Resting gastrocnemius glycogen did not differ among the groups. After 30 min of running, gastrocnemius glycogen was lower in the untrained than the trained groups and was not different between the trained groups. Resting liver glycogen was lower in the old trained group than the untrained groups but not statistically different from the young trained group. The postrun liver glycogen did not differ among the groups. Estimated gastrocnemius and liver glycogen utilization during exercise was decreased in both trained groups compared with untrained age-matched controls. These results indicate that the training-induced glycogen sparing during exercise of the same relative intensity was not diminished with age in identically trained young and old rats.\r"

Diaphragmatic fibers were obtained from 15 rats, and papillary muscles, soleus, and EDL were obtained from 10 animals. Isometric force generated in response to 1-Hz supramaximal electrical stimulation was measured with a highly sensitive photoelectric transducer. After control measurements, perfusion with a Krebs solution depleted of calcium (0 Ca2+) was started while the fibers were continuously stimulated (4 times/min) and twitches recorded. For the papillary fibers, perfusion with zero Ca2+ was followed by an immediate decrease in twitch tension, complete twitch abolition occurring within 3 +/- 1 min after zero-Ca2+ exposure. Diaphragmatic fibers behaved similarly, although twitch abolition was delayed (10 +/- 3 min after 0-Ca2+ exposure). For the soleus fibers, the twitch amplitude amounted to 38 +/- 10% of control (62% decrease on the average) after 30 min of zero-Ca2+ exposure, no twitch abolition being noted even after 1 h of Ca2+-free exposure. The twitch amplitude of the EDL fibers amounted to 75 +/- 7% of control (25% decrease) after 30 min of zero-Ca2+ exposure. The recovery kinetics for the four fiber types after reexposure to Ca2+-containing solution were also different, with papillary and diaphragmatic fibers recovering completely within 2.5 +/- 0.5 and 4 +/- 0.5 min, respectively. By contrast, neither the soleus nor the EDL showed complete recovery after 30 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the range of arterial pressure from approximately 7 to 14.5 Torr and venous pressure of 1.4 to 10.8 Torr, the total lobar blood volume ranged from approximately 2 to approximately 2.6 ml/kg body wt. About 19% of the lobar vascular volume was in the arteries, approximately 59% was in the capillaries, and approximately 22% was in the veins. The lobar vascular compliance was approximately 0.065 ml.Torr-1.kg body wt-1 with an arterial-capillary-venous distribution of approximately 30:49:21. These results suggest that the largest fractions of the intralobar blood volume and compliance are in the capillary bed. The segmental compliances along with outflow occlusion data were used to place lower and upper bounds on the arterial, capillary, and venous resistances. These bounds were 13.6 and 61.4% of the total vascular resistance for the arteries, 0 and 59.4% for the capillaries, and 5.5 and 64.9% for the veins, respectively. These bounds are rather broad, but they help to put the information content of the occlusion data under the conditions of these experiments into perspective.\r"

We found that the resistance distribution had two modes, a larger one upstream and a smaller one downstream from a local minimum. Over the range of vascular pressures studied the total vascular resistance decreased and the vascular volume increased with increasing vascular pressure. However, the shape of the normalized resistance distribution was independent of vascular pressure. Comparisons of the resistance distributions with the distributions of arterial, capillary, and venous volumes suggest that the modes represent regions of relatively high resistance proximal and distal to the capillary bed. These results are consistent with the concept that within the lobar vascular bed the highest resistance per unit blood volume is in the smallest arteries and veins, as suggested by morphometric data from other sources.\r"

Lungs from New Zealand White rabbits (n = 10) were excised, perfused with saline and autologous whole blood (1:1), ventilated, and continuously weighed. Pulmonary arterial and venous pressures (Pvas) were referenced to the most dependent part of the lung. A change in vascular volume (delta Vvas) and a fluid filtration rate (FFR) were calculated from the change in lung weight that occurred from 0 to 30 s and from 3 to 5 and 5 to 10 min, respectively, after changing alveolar pressure (PA). FFR's and delta Vvas's were measured with Pvas equal to 2 or 10 cmH2O and PA changing from 15 to 30 cmH2O when the lungs were normal and after they were made edematous. When Pvas = 2 cmH2O, increasing PA increased the Vvas and the FFR in both normal and edematous lungs. However, when Pvas = 10 cmH2O, increasing PA only slightly changed the Vvas and reduced the FFR in the normal lungs, and decreased Vvas and markedly decreased the FFR in the presence of edema. Inflating zone 1 lungs by positive pressure has an effect on transvascular fluid flux that depends on the Pvas. The results suggest that the sites of leakage in zone 1 also vary depending on Pvas and PA.\r"

With the use of the glycogen depletion method, the specific location and proportion of muscle fibers innervated by the fifth (C5) or sixth (C6) cervical ventral roots were determined for different regions of the DIA. The sternal and ventral portions of the costal and crural DIA regions were innervated primarily by C5. The dorsal portions of both the costal and crural regions were innervated primarily by C6. Thus the somatotopic organization in the segmental innervation of the DIA was not correlated with the anatomic division of the sternal, costal, and crural regions. Instead, the somatotopic projections of cervical ventral roots were organized in the ventrodorsal axis of each DIA region. This topographical pattern resulted in an extensive overlap of the DIA territories innervated by C5 and C6. Within a region, the fibers innervated by a specific ventral root were not randomly distributed but often followed fascicle divisions. This frequently resulted in a wide range in the proportion of fibers innervated by a ventral root even within a specific region.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the dihedral angle, alpha, at the characteristic three-way septal junctions of lung parenchyma, we examined photomicrographs of sections. The three angles, A, formed where three septal traces meet on section, were measured and found to range between approximately 50 and 170 degrees. Theoretical considerations predicted that the dispersion of alpha is much narrower than that of A. The mean of A and alpha is identically 120 degrees. The standard deviation of alpha was inferred from the cumulative distribution function of A. In lungs inflated to 30 cmH2O (VL30), the standard deviation of alpha was very small (approximately 2 degrees) and increased to approximately 6 degrees in lungs inflated to 0.4 VL30. These findings imply that at VL30 tensions exerted by septa are locally homogeneous (2% variation) and at lower lung volumes become less so (6% variation). At high distending pressures, tissue forces are thought to dominate interfacial forces, and therefore the local uniformity of tensions suggests a stress-responsive mechanism for forming or remodeling the connective tissues. The source of the local nonuniformity at lower volumes is unclear but could relate to differences in mechanical properties of alveolar duct and alveoli. Finally, local uniformity does not imply global uniformity.\r"

We cultured bovine fetal aortic endothelial cells on fibronectin-coated polycarbonate filters and confirmed that our system was similar to others in the literature with regard to morphological appearance, transendothelial electrical resistance, and the permeability coefficient for albumin. We then compared our system with in vivo endothelium by studying the movement of neutral and negatively charged radiolabeled dextran tracers across the monolayer and by using electron microscopy to follow the pathways taken by native ferritin. There were a number of differences. The permeability of our monolayer was 10-100 times greater than seen in intact endothelium, there was no evidence of \"restricted\" diffusion or charge selectivity, and ferritin was able to move freely into the subendothelial space. The reason for these differences appeared to be small (0.5-2.0 micron) gaps between 5 and 10% of the endothelial cells. Although the current use of cultured endothelial cells on porous supports may provide useful information about the interaction of macromolecules with the endothelium, there appear to be differences in the transendothelial permeability characteristics of these models and in vivo blood vessels.\r"

  ".W": "Theoretical studies dealing with the principle of minimal respiratory effort usually make use of sinusoidal or saw-tooth-like breathing patterns. Recent observations in anesthetized cats have shown that the driving pressure waveform for inspiration can be described by a power function of time and that most of expiration is passive. This driving pressure waveform, however, results in breathing patterns that differ from those described above. For this reason, we have reevaluated in anesthetized cats the principle of minimal respiratory effort by computing optimal duration of inspiration (TI) and optimal tidal volume (VT) for different ventilatory conditions using actual driving pressure waveforms. The results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations; i.e., optimal TI decreases and optimal VT increases with increasing minute ventilation. On the average, a good agreement is found between measured and computed values of TI. In some cats, however, there are substantial differences between observed and predicted values of TI, which can probably be ascribed to inaccuracies in the data used in our computations. Despite its limitations, the present model analysis is more realistic than previous ones because actual driving pressure waveforms are used together with actual values of effective inspiratory impedance.\r"

In vivo, we measured the doses of carbachol that induced a 100% increase in lung resistance (PD100 RL), a 50% decrease in dynamic lung compliance (PD50 Cdyn), and the value of systolic blood pressure at the carbachol dose of 10 micrograms (Pa 10 micrograms). In vitro airway smooth muscle and systemic arterial smooth muscle responsiveness was assessed by measuring the maximal response to acetylcholine, the slope of the linear portion of the dose-response curve, and the negative logarithm of the molar concentration of acetylcholine producing 50% of the maximal response (pD2). PD100 and PD50 were about four times greater in BN rats than in RA rats. In contrast, Pa 10 micrograms was 1.5 lower in the BN rats. These differences persisted after bivagotomy. Tracheal pD2 was 25% greater in the RA than in the BN strain. The mean dose-response curve of parenchymal strips of RA rats was situated upward and to the left of the BN curve, but the reverse was observed for aortic smooth muscle dose-response curves. Thus 1) airway smooth muscle responsiveness to cholinergic agents is greater in RA strain than in BN, but the reverse is true for systemic arterial smooth muscle responsiveness; and 2) these differences are not due to factors extrinsic to the smooth muscle, since they occurred in vitro and may depend on different densities of muscarinic receptors.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism underlying the polyphasic airflow pattern of the equine species, we recorded airflow, tidal volum, rib cage and abdominal motion, and the sequence of activation of the diaphragm, intercostal, and abdominal muscles during quiet breathing in nine adult horses standing at rest. In addition, esophageal, abdominal, and transdiaphragmatic pressures were simultaneously recorded using balloon-tipped catheters. Analysis of tidal flow-volume loops showed that, unlike humans, the horse at rest breathes around, rather than from, the relaxed volume of the respiratory system (Vrx). Analysis of the pattern of electromyographic activities and changes in generated pressures during the breathing cycle indicate that the first part of expiration is passive, as in humans, with deflation toward Vrx, but subsequent abdominal activity is responsible for a second phase of expiration: active deflation to below Vrx. From this end-expiratory volume, passive inflation occurs toward Vrx, followed by a second phase of inspiration: active inflation to above Vrx, brought about by inspiratory muscle contraction. Under these conditions the abdominal muscles appear to share the principal pumping duties with the diaphragm. Adoption of this breathing strategy by the horse may relate to its peculiar thoracoabdominal anatomic arrangement and to its very low passive chest wall compliance. We conclude that there is a passive and active phase to both inspiration and expiration due to the coordinated action of the respiratory pump muscles responsible for the resting adult horse's biphasic inspiratory and expiratory airflow pattern. This unique breathing pattern perhaps represents a strategy of minimizing the high elastic work of breathing in this species, at least at resting breathing frequencies.\r"

Nasal occlusion at end expiration was achieved by inflating balloon-tipped catheters located within the portals of a nose mask. No seal was placed over the mouth. During nose breathing in non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, nasal airway occlusion resulted in multiple respiratory efforts before arousal. Mouth breathing was not initiated until arousal. Phasic inspiratory genioglossus activity was present in eight subjects during NREM sleep. In these subjects, comparison of peak genioglossus inspiratory activity on the first three occluded efforts to the value just before occlusion showed an increase of 4.7, 16.1, and 28.0%, respectively. The relative increases in peak genioglossus activity were very similar to respective increases in peak diaphragm activity. Arousal was associated with a large burst in genioglossus activity. During airway occlusion in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, mouth breathing could occur without a change in sleep state. In general, genioglossus responses to airway occlusion in REM sleep were similar in pattern to those in NREM sleep. A relatively small reflex activation of upper airway muscles associated with a sudden increase in subatmospheric pressure in the potentially collapsible segment of the upper airway may help compromise upper airway patency during sleep.\r"

Changes in mechanical properties of the respiratory system during hypoxia have been considered an important reason for this fall in minute ventilation (VE). We have studied the dynamic mechanical behavior of the respiratory system in eight unanesthetized intact newborn lambs (mean age 2 days) during normoxia and hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.08). Mouth pressure (P), airflow (V), and volume (V) were recorded while lambs were breathing through a leak-proof face mask and a pneumotachograph. Active compliance (C') and resistance (R') of the respiratory system were computed from P developed during an inspiratory effort against airway closure at end expiration and V and V of the preceding breaths. Tidal expiratory V-V curves were analyzed to estimate the elevation in functional residual capacity (FRC) over resting volume (Vr). After hypoxia, there was an immediate increase in VE in the first 2 min, from 0.49 to 1.13 l.kg-1.min-1, followed by a rapid decrease to 0.80. After 8 min of hypoxia, C' was unchanged. The inspiratory R' decreased during hypoxia, probably reflecting a drop in inspiratory laryngeal resistance. The expiratory V-V curves during hypoxia showed considerable braking, often with a double peak in expiratory V. This pattern was only occasionally seen during normoxia. In animals with a linear segment of the expiratory V-V curves the FRC-Vr difference could be calculated and averaged 1.93 ml/kg during normoxia and 3.47 during hypoxia. The recoil P of the respiratory system at end expiration was 0.75 cmH2O during normoxia vs. 1.63 cmH2O during hypoxia (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three days after the placement of a rib capsule in 18 sheep, we instilled a 10 ml/kg 1.0 g/dl autologous protein solution with labeled albumin and erythrocytes through the capsule into the pleural space. Erythrocytes were used as a marker for lymphatic flow. We measured terminal pleural liquid volume and radioactivity at periods from 2 to 48 h. In three sheep, we obtained a third volume measurement at 6 h by the volume of dilution technique. We found that hydrothorax removal could be described by a linear function with a constant rate: 0.28 +/- 0.01 ml.kg-1.h-1 (mean +/- SE) for the grouped data, and 0.20, 0.28, and 0.31 ml.kg-1.h-1 for the individual sheep. At 24 h, erythrocyte clearance was 89 +/- 16% (mean +/- SD) that of liquid and albumin clearance. We conclude that in awake sheep with large hydrothoraxes, pleural liquid and protein are removed at a rate of 0.28 +/- 0.01 ml.kg-1.h-1 (mean +/- SE) and lymphatics are responsible for at least 89% of this removal.\r"

The present findings indicate that exercise SV in untrained men is preload dependent and that increases in exercise SV occur in response to the first 400 ml of PV expansion. It appears that approximately one-half of the difference in SV normally observed between untrained and highly endurance-trained men during upright exercise is due to a suboptimal BV in the untrained men.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the role of barometric pressure in high-altitude pulmonary edema, we randomly exposed five unanesthetized chronically instrumented sheep with lung lymph fistulas in a decompression chamber to each of three separate conditions: hypobaric hypoxia, normobaric hypoxia, and normoxic hypobaria. A combination of slow decompression and/or simultaneous adjustment of inspired PO2 provided three successive stages of simulated altitudes of 2,600, 4,600, and 6,600 m during which hemodynamics and lymph flow were monitored. Under both hypoxic conditions we noted significant and equivalent elevations in pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), cardiac output, and heart rate, with left atrial and systemic pressures remaining fairly constant. Normoxic hypobaria was also accompanied by a smaller but significant rise in Ppa. Lymph flow increased to a highly significant maximum of 73% above base line, accompanied by a slight but significant decrease in lung lymph-to-plasma protein ratio, only under conditions of combined hypobaric hypoxia but not under equivalent degrees of alveolar hypoxia or hypobaria alone. Arterial hypoxemia was noted under all three conditions, with arterial PO2 being uniformly lower under hypobaric conditions than when identical amounts of inspired PO2 were delivered at normal atmospheric pressure. We therefore hypothesize that alveolar pressure significantly alters the Starling forces governing transcapillary fluid flux in the lung and may affect the alveolar-arterial gradient for O2 as well.\r"

This is based on the implicit assumption that changes in thoracic volume (Vtho) and Vsyr are equal. We undertook to verify this assumption through simultaneous measurements of Vtho by respiratory inductive plethysmography and Vsyr in six comatose, paralyzed, intubated patients. At any constant Vsyr, Vtho fell and was smaller on deflation than on inflation during inflation-deflation (ID) cycle. The rate of fall was 110 +/- 64 (SD) ml/min. During ID cycles lasting 76 +/- 7 s, thoracic PV curves showed less hysteresis and a larger compliance on deflation than PVsyr curves (12 +/- 2 vs. 18 +/- 6% and 73 +/- 13 vs. 67 +/- 12 ml/cmH2O, P less than 0.05). With PVsyr curves, hysteresis increased and compliance on deflation decreased with increasing rate of fall of Vtho. We submit that the difference between changes in Vsyr and Vtho is best explained by gas exchange and should be taken into account when performing PV curves with a syringe in paralyzed patients.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the relationship between airway closure and collateral ventilation, Ar bolus single-breath washout tests were performed in the supine position in 10 mature dogs (animals with a well-developed collateral ventilation). Transpulmonary pressure was measured simultaneously to obtain the volume above residual volume of the inflection point in the pressure-volume curve (VIP). In pigs, closing volume (CV/VC%, mean 27.4%, where VC is vital capacity) equaled the volume of inflection (VIP/VC%, mean 35.1%) when the dead space (0.07 liter) was accounted for, indicating simultaneous onset. In dogs, closing volume (CV/VC%, mean 48.1%) was greater than the volume of inflection (VIP/VC%, mean 27%). Furthermore, as closing volume increased, so did the volume exhaled between closing volume and the volume of inflection [(CV-VIP)/VC%]. These increases were strongly age related, with the oldest dogs showing the greatest differences between closing volume and volume of inflection. These results support the previous suggestion that this difference is a measure of the degree of collateral ventilation. We defined a concavity index (CI) of phase IV by measuring the ratio of the end-to-mid phase IV height above extrapolated phase III (no concavity implies CI = 2). Whereas pigs had a low CI (mean 3.3), dogs had a high CI (mean 10.6). In dogs, the CI correlated well with closing volume (CV/VC%) and the volume exhaled between closing volume and volume of inflection [(CV-VIP)/VC%]. Again, this relationship was strongly dependent on age, suggesting that the CI is also a valid indication of the degree of collateral ventilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During hypoxia (PO2: 40 +/- 4 Torr) the responses of isolated porcine pulmonary artery and vein spiral strips to LTD4 increased approximately three- and two-fold, respectively, and the vein also exhibited an augmented response to histamine. The augmentation was blunted (LTD4) or reversed (histamine) during anoxia (PO2: 0 +/- 2 Torr). Responses to KCl were not systematically altered by reduced oxygenation. In contrast, the contractions of the guinea pig parenchymal lung strip by all three agonists were generally suppressed by reduced oxygenation. After reoxygenation, the contractile responses of each of the three smooth muscle preparations were generally increased compared with previous and concurrent base-line observations, particularly the LTD4-induced pulmonary vein contraction that increased approximately sevenfold after reoxygenation after anoxia. The contribution (if any) of leukotrienes to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction may reflect increased vascular responsiveness to leukotrienes during hypoxia as well as (or instead of) increased leukotriene release.\r"

Pulmonary mechanics were assessed using the technique of rapid airway occlusion during constant-flow inflation which allows measurement of the intrinsic pulmonary resistance (RLmin) and of the overall \"pulmonary flow resistance\" (RLmax), which includes the additional pulmonary pressure losses due to time constant inequalities within the lung and/or stress adaptation. We observed that, at fixed inflation volume, 1) RLmin fitted Rohrer's equation, 2) RLmax was higher at low than intermediate flows, and 3) RLmax-RLmin decreased progressively with increasing flow. At fixed flow, RLmax increased, whereas RLmin decreased with increasing volume. We conclude that during eupneic breathing in cats, the pulmonary flow resistance as conventionally measured includes a significant component reflecting stress adaptation.\r"

Two impulses (10 s at a 235-W increase above a 25-W base line, I-235; and 5 s at a 475-W increase above a 25-W base line, I-475), four steps (ST) (25-65 W, ST1; 65-105 W, ST2; 25-105 W, ST3; and 25-145 W, ST4), and the corresponding off-transient responses were performed six to eight times by each of five subjects. The integrated area (G) of the VO2 response for I-235 was similar to that of ST1 and ST2 (P greater than 0.05); the I-475 G was significantly greater (P less than 0.05). The time constant of VO2 during the step function on-transient response for the second exponential component was significantly faster for ST1 and significantly slower for I-235 and I-475 than for ST2, ST3, and ST4 (P less than 0.05). However, I-235 and I-475 time constants for VO2 were not different from the ST off-transient values. Attempts to superimpose the integral of the impulse on the ST data showed that the early rapid increase in VO2 in the ST was underpredicted by the impulse and that the impulse response lagged behind the ST at all points before steady state. It can be concluded that VO2 kinetics failed the test of superposition and are therefore described by a nonlinear dynamic system.\r"

To distinguish between effects of reduced caloric intake and infection per se, we also studied healthy control animals and noninfected animals subjected to caloric restriction. Three muscles were tested in vitro: plantaris, soleus, and diaphragm. Both caloric restriction and LD infection caused loss of body weight and reduced muscle cross-sectional areas and wet weights. The interventions had variable effects on in vitro contractile properties, the most pronounced being reduction in peak tension in response to tetanic stimulation. Tension loss was 35-45%, except for a loss of 65% in plantaris of LD-infected animals. We conclude that chronic LD infection affects skeletal muscles in both indirect and direct ways. 1) Reduced caloric intake due to anorexia decreases muscle size and active tension. Disuse probably enhances this effect in limb muscles. 2) Infection produces profound weakness of inactive fast-twitch muscle by unknown mechanisms.\r"

To study the intact trachea from guinea pigs we developed an in vitro preparation that permits independent stimulation from either the inner epithelial surface or the outer serosal surface. The whole guinea pig trachea was excised, cannulated, and perfused at a constant flow with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution that was in direct contact with the inner epithelial-lined surface. The outer serosal surface of the trachea was immersed in a separate system (bath) containing KH solution. Tracheal responses were assessed by measuring the pressure drop between the tracheal inlet and the outlet under conditions of constant flow. When the trachea was precontracted with carbachol or KCl, hyperosmolar stimuli (KCl, mannitol, urea, or NaCl) produced concentration-dependent relaxation when applied to the inner epithelial surface. Relaxation was not produced when the hyperosmolar stimulus was applied to the serosal surface and was markedly reduced or abolished when the epithelial surface had been physically damaged or removed. These results indicate that hyperosmotic stimuli induce epithelial-dependent relaxation of trachea. A defect in this mechanism may be partially responsible for the bronchoconstriction seen in asthmatic subjects after exercise.\r"

The accumulated O2 deficit was determined for 11 subjects during 5 exhausting bouts of treadmill running lasting from 15 s to greater than 4 min. The accumulated O2 deficit increased with the duration for exhausting bouts lasting up to 2 min, but a leveling off was found for bouts lasting 2 min or more. Between-subject variation in the maximal accumulated O2 deficit ranged from 52 to 90 ml/kg. During exhausting exercise while subjects inspired air with reduced O2 content (O2 fraction = 13.5%), the maximal O2 uptake was 22% lower, whereas the accumulated O2 deficit remained unchanged. The precision of the method is 3 ml/kg. The method is based on estimation of the O2 demand by extrapolating the linear relationship between treadmill speed and O2 uptake at submaximal intensities. The slopes, which reflect running economy, varied by 16% between subjects, and the relationships had to be determined individually. This can be done either by measuring the O2 uptake at a minimum of 10 different submaximal intensities or by two measurements close to the maximal O2 uptake and by making use of a common Y-intercept of 5 ml.kg-1.min-1. By using these individual relationships the maximal accumulated O2 deficit, which appears to be a direct quantitative expression of the anaerobic capacity, can be calculated after measuring the O2 uptake during one exhausting bout of exercise lasting 2-3 min.\r"

We studied the effects of liquid expansion of the fetal lung by measuring vascular conductance in perfused lungs in situ and arterial diameters in excised lungs of fetal lambs. Pulmonary vascular conductance invariably rose as the lung was deflated from its initial volume; maximal deflation to residual volume increased conductance 122%. With reexpansion, conductance fell progressively, culminating in cessation of flow at lung volumes of twice the initial volume. These changes persisted after vagotomy and thoracic sympathectomy and therefore were mechanical in character. Lung expansion from residual volume initially expanded 300- to 500-micron arteries but compressed arteries greater than 1,500 micron. Further expansion reduced the caliber of all arteries. Thus increasing lung liquid volume progressively constricts the pulmonary circulation in the fetus. Because the fetal pulmonary vascular resistance-lung volume relationship differs from that of the U-shaped form found in adult lungs, concepts based on the adult pulmonary circulation are not appropriate for liquid-filled fetal lungs.\r"

This model has been modified to permit the stimulation of the pressure and flow distribution effects of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction for a two-compartment lung and generalized to allow comparison with the experimental results from dogs (and probably other species). Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is simulated by reduction of the initial diameter of the smallest six orders of pulmonary arteries. Expressions are presented that relate the alveolar and mixed-venous O2 tensions to a graded constriction of these vessels. In addition, the diameter of the capillary sheet and the six small arteries is defined with a maximum diameter at a transmural pressure of 20 cmH2O. Pressure-flow curves are derived for any combination of alveolar and mixed-venous O2 tension, alveolar and pleural pressure, left atrial pressure, and hematocrit. The two-compartment model is solved by an iterative procedure to identify the distribution of the flow and the resulting pulmonary arterial pressure when the compartments differ by size, hypoxic constriction, or other imposed conditions. The results of the model are compared with those from a variety of experimental preparations. It is concluded that the model is useful for identifying the quantitative causes of changes in the response to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and for the exploration of the functional influence of mechanical properties of the vasculature.\r"

In the face of significant muscle weakness produced by pancuronium, breathing patterns are characterized by decreases in both tidal volume and respiratory frequency. The decreased tidal volume corresponded to the decrease in occlusion pressure, indicating that the decreased tidal volume results solely from a decreased contractile force of the respiratory muscles. The decreased respiratory frequency was due to prolongation of both inspiratory and expiratory time without changing the ratio of the inspiratory time to the total breath time. Withdrawal of phasic vagal influence by airway occlusion before partial muscle paralysis revealed that an active Breuer-Hering inflation reflex was operative in only 8 of all 17 subjects. Since the contribution of the Breuer-Hering inflation reflex alone does not seem to account for the consistent decrease in respiratory frequency, some other mechanisms modulating respiratory frequency might be involved in the characteristic breathing patterns during partial muscle paralysis under enflurane anesthesia.\r"

The shape of EMG trajectory was similar for all muscles and conditions; activation of different muscles could be thus compared on the basis of changes in peak activity. In intact dogs changes in peak activity were greater for the scalenes and cranial parasternals than for the caudal parasternals and greater for the inspiratory thoracic muscles (ITM) than for the DI. Posture, vagotomy, and cordotomy at C7-T1 did not affect the rate of rise of DI activity. The relations between peak activity of ITM did not change because of posture, vagotomy, and phrenicotomy. Vagotomy selectively depressed the rate of rise of ITM activity, but relative changes in peak ITM activity for a given change in peak DI activity were independent of intact vagi. Differences in the pattern of activation between inspiratory muscles with rebreathing are largely independent of proprioceptive inputs and likely reflect properties of central control mechanisms. However, airway occlusion at end expiration caused a reflex fall of DI activity and reflex increase of ITM activity in intact and vagotomized dogs. Cordotomy at C7-T1 did not change DI response, whereas reduction of ITM activity occurred after phrenicotomy, indicating that both facilitatory and inhibitory segmental inputs are involved in ITM response to loading.\r"

At a minimum twenty-four-month follow-up, the average Hospital for Special Surgery knee-rating score for the patients who had a cemented kinematic-II prosthesis was 9 points higher than the average score for the patients who had a non-cemented anatomic implant (88 points and 79 points).

Over-all, 85 per cent of the results were good or excellent at final follow-up. Tibial radiolucent lines of one to two millimeters were observed in 29 per cent of the knees at follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After an average duration of follow-up of 6.5 years (range, two to 25.7 years), the complications were many and severe. Of eight arthroplasties that were done for replacement of a joint, five required early revision or excision: two, because of mechanical loosening; two, because of sepsis; and one, due to a fracture of the prosthetic stem. There was excessive perioperative blood loss, prolonged hospitalization, and medical or surgical complications in all patients, including the three who had sickle-cell trait and only slight manifestations of systemic disease. A survivorship analysis of this series indicated that a failure rate of 50 per cent could be expected by 5.4 years postoperatively.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-eight (49 per cent) of seventy-seven paraplegic patients whose level of injury was at or caudad to the second thoracic vertebra were found to have signs and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. The prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome was found to increase with the length of time after the injury. In the eighteen patients in whom manometric studies were done, the carpal tunnel pressures when the wrist was in the neutral position were higher than those that have been reported in non-paraplegic patients who did not have carpal tunnel syndrome but were lower than the values in non-paraplegic patients who did have the syndrome. When the wrist was in flexion, the pressures were similar to the values that have been reported for non-paraplegic patients. However, in the paraplegic patients, regardless of whether or not they had carpal tunnel syndrome, the pressures that developed when the wrist was in extension were significantly higher than those in non-paraplegic patients, regardless of whether or not they had carpal tunnel syndrome. Most of the activities of daily living of paraplegic patients, including the maneuver to relieve ischial pressure that consists of arising from the seated position using the extended arms, are performed with the wrists locked in maximum extension. The pressure that develops in the carpal canal during this forced extension of the wrist, probably combined with the repetitive trauma to the volar aspect of the extended wrist while propelling a wheelchair, contributes to the high frequency with which carpal tunnel syndrome is found in paraplegic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Teleroentgenograms of the upper extremity in 244 children (123 boys and 121 girls) were made at six-month intervals from the age of seven to the time of skeletal maturity. Lengths were measured to determine the growth remaining at both growth plates of the humerus, radius, and ulna. The subjects were healthy, well nourished, middle-class Americans, mostly of northwest European descent. After the age of seven, the proportion between the upper and lower arms does not change appreciably. The humerus is 18 per cent of standing height in girls at the age of seven and 19 per cent at the age of fifteen. In boys, the humerus is 18 per cent of standing height at the age of seven and 20 per cent at the age of seventeen. The length of the radius is 13 per cent of standing height in girls at the age of seven, increasing to 14 per cent by skeletal maturity. In boys, the length of the radius increases from 14 per cent of standing height at the age of seven to 15 per cent at skeletal maturity. From the age of seven to skeletal maturity, the humerus grows approximately 1.2 centimeters in girls and 1.3 centimeters in boys each year. In girls, the ulna grows approximately 1.0 centimeter and the radius, 0.9 centimeter each year after the age of seven. In boys, the ulna grows approximately 1.1 centimeters and the radius, approximately 1.0 centimeter each year from the age of seven to skeletal maturity. Based on these data, accurate predictions of growth and of growth discrepancy in the upper extremity can be made, and the time at which to perform equalization procedures can be determined more precisely.\r"

  ".W": "The latissimus dorsi was transferred on its neurovascular pedicle to reconstruct the shoulder or brachium in nineteen patients. Group I consisted of seven patients in whom transfer of the latissimus dorsi was used only to obtain active flexion of the elbow. Although there was complete necrosis of the transferred muscle in one patient, six patients achieved an average of 111 degrees of active flexion and full extension of the elbow. There was only a modest gain in active supination because of pre-existing pronation contractures. The three patients in Group II had sustained loss of the flexor muscles of the elbow and the overlying soft tissue as a result of trauma. After the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flexorplasty, an average of 135 degrees of active flexion of the elbow was restored, but there was an average loss of 12 degrees of extension. The three patients in Group III had a large, noninfected defect of the soft tissue over the shoulder or brachium; the bone, shoulder joint, or neurovascular structures were exposed in each patient. Transfer of the latissimus dorsi with the overlying skin provided satisfactory coverage of the defect. The six patients in Group IV had chronic osteomyelitis or septic arthritis of the glenohumeral joint. Treatment consisted of radical debridement of the infected soft tissue and bone followed by transfer of the latissimus dorsi. This provided satisfactory coverage for subsequent osteosynthesis of the humerus or arthrodesis of the shoulder when one of these procedures was indicated. At the time of writing, an average of 2.3 years after the latissimus dorsi transfer, none of the patients in this group (including one who died nine months post-operatively of unrelated causes) had drainage.\r"

The techniques that were studied were intraoperative irrigation with saline solution or with antimicrobial solution, perioperative systemic administration of antibiotics, and the addition of an antibiotic to bone cement. Irrigation with saline solution did not reduce the incidence of infection. A slight reduction was found after irrigation with neomycin solution and after systemic administration of cefazolin solution. The use of bone cement containing gentamicin caused a statistically significant reduction in the rate of infection; in fact, no infection developed in any animal that was treated with bone cement containing gentamicin. There was excellent but not absolute correlation between findings on culture that indicated the presence of infection and histological evidence of inflammation.\r"

Five dogs were ovariectomized and five dogs had a sham operation. After waiting four months to allow the levels of circulating estrogen to decline, a titanium-alloy implant that contained four surface pads of titanium-alloy mesh was implanted in the proximal part of the humerus of each dog bilaterally. Two months later, the implants were harvested and subjected to a mechanical push-out test and quantitative histological study. The push-out strength of the implants from the ovariectomized dogs was 31 per cent less than in the control animals. Ovariectomy caused no difference in the amount of ingrowth of bone but resulted in a significant increase in the amount of fibrous connective tissue within the porous pads. The presence of this fibrous tissue appeared to have an important effect on bone-implant fixation: in the control dogs, strength correlated positively with ingrowth of bone and negatively with ingrowth of fibrous tissue, whereas in the ovariectomized dogs, strength correlated positively with ingrowth of fibrous tissue and not at all with ingrowth of bone.\r"

There were 51 per cent excellent, 29 per cent good, 4 per cent fair, and 16 per cent poor results after a minimum follow-up of two years. The resection of tibial bone that was produced by the osteotomy could not be related causally to the fair or poor clinical results that were found after arthroplasty. Radiographic study, however, showed that 80 per cent of the knees had patella infera before the arthroplasty, which may contribute to altered biomechanics of the patellofemoral joint of the arthroplasty. The procedure for total knee replacement is made more difficult by the previous osteotomy, and a custom-made prosthesis may be required. The clinical results that were obtained in this series are similar to those for the revision total knee arthroplasties that have been done at this institution, but they were not as satisfactory as those that were obtained after primary total knee replacement. Our results should be considered when a surgeon compares the advantages and disadvantages of proximal tibial osteotomy with those of total knee arthroplasty for an older patient who has unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee.\r"

When they were first seen, fifty-two patients (95 per cent) were unable to stand erect and forty-nine (89 per cent) had back pain. The previous use of distraction instrumentation with a hook placed at the level of the lower lumbar spine or the sacrum was the factor that was most frequently identified as leading to the development of the flatback syndrome. Sixty-six extension osteotomies were performed in these fifty-five patients. Nineteen patients (35 per cent) had an associated anterior spinal fusion. Thirty-three patients (60 per cent) had one or more complications, including pseudarthrosis, a dural tear, failure of hardware, neurapraxia, and urinary tract infection. The results of the operation were evaluated at follow-up by review of clinical records, radiographs, and questionnaires. At an average follow-up of six years (range, two to fourteen years), most patients felt that they had benefited from the corrective osteotomies. However, twenty-six patients (47 per cent) continued to lean forward and twenty patients (36 per cent) continued to have moderate or severe back pain. The failure to restore sagittal plane balance led to a higher rate of pseudarthrosis, which was associated with recurrent deformity. Anterior spinal fusion combined with posterior osteotomy resulted in greater maintenance of correction. The prevention of flatback syndrome is important, since its treatment is difficult. When a spinal fusion must be extended to the level of the lower lumbar spine or the sacrum, the use of distraction instrumentation should be avoided in order to prevent this deformity.\r"

  ".W": "An autogenous graft of tibial periosteum was sutured (with its cambium layer facing into the joint) to the base of a five by ten-millimeter full-thickness defect in the patellar groove of each of forty-five adolescent rabbits. The rabbits were randomly treated postoperatively by either four weeks of immobilization in a cast, intermittent active motion in a cage, or two weeks of continuous passive motion. One year postoperatively, the regenerated tissue from each rabbit was analyzed macroscopically, histologically, histochemically, and biochemically. Gross degenerative changes were seen in 57 per cent of the rabbits that had been immobilized in a cast, in 73 per cent of the rabbits that had been allowed intermittent active motion, and in 22 per cent of the rabbits that had been subjected to continuous passive motion (p less than 0.05). Out of a possible score of 7.0 points for the nature of the regenerated tissue, the scores for the three groups were: immobilization in a cast, 4.1 points; intermittent active motion, 4.0 points; and continuous passive motion, 5.9 points (p greater than 0.05). Out of a possible perfect combined score of 10.0 points for the structural characteristics of the regenerated tissue, the cast-immobilization group scored 3.8 points; the intermittent active-motion group, 2.5 points; and the continuous passive-motion group, 6.4 points (p less than 0.001). The total scores for freedom from cellular changes of degeneration, a perfect score being 5.0 points, were: immobilization in a cast, 2.4 points; intermittent active motion, 2.3 points; and continuous passive motion, 3.9 points (p less than 0.01). Degenerative changes in the adjacent cartilage, which were noted in 42 and 46 per cent of the knees in the immobilization and intermittent active-motion groups, respectively, were not found in the knees that had been subjected to continuous passive motion (p less than 0.05). The total indices, which were derived by combining the scores for all categories (maximum, 24.0 points), revealed that the index for the continuous passive-motion group was significantly better than the index for either of the other two groups: immobilization in a cast, 12.9 points; intermittent active motion, 11.2 points; and continuous passive motion, 19.2 points (p less than 0.0005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These strategies, especially admission of off-service ICU patients, led to an increased patient census despite an unchanged number of burn admissions and a decrease in the number of burn patient days because of earlier discharge. Policies for control of nonburn patients were essential, as were programs to educate nurses in management of other critically ill patients. These measures resulted in increased utilization and commitment of additional personnel to the burn center.\r"

Medical records of pediatric and adult patients were retrospectively reviewed. The findings showed a significant linear decline in mean plasma copper, ceruloplasmin, and total serum protein during the first three days postburn, followed in general by a gradual rise in levels; however, patients with burns larger than 60% TBSA maintained copper, zinc, and ceruloplasmin levels significantly below the lower limits of normal during the observation period. Significant decrements in copper, zinc, total serum protein, and ceruloplasmin levels have been demonstrated in these patients. Trace metal determinations should be obtained in patients with significant burns soon after admission and routinely throughout their hospital course. Specific trace metal supplementation should be administered when indicated.\r"

Peroxide and hydroxyl ions have been implicated as mediators in the increased microvascular permeability and pulmonary edema noted after inhalation injury. In this study we evaluated the use of an O2-free radical scavenger, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and heparin in the treatment of smoke inhalation. Ewes (N = 26) that had been surgically prepared five days earlier were insufflated with smoke from burning cotton. There were four groups: controls (n = 7), DMSO (n = 6), heparin (n = 6), and DMSO plus heparin (n = 7). All animals were given ventilatory support to maintain their PO2 above 60 mmHg and their PCO2 below 45 mmHg. There was a significant difference in survival rates between groups. By 72 hours all seven of the control group were dead. All animals in the DMSO plus heparin group survived, four of the DMSO group died, and two of the heparin group died. Lung lymph flow was not as high in the DMSO plus heparin group as in the heparin-only group. DMSO was proved effective in reducing the lung injury associated with smoke inhalation.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated coronary perfused guinea pig hearts were used to determine if aging alters left ventricular (LV) intrinsic contractile response to unresuscitated burn shock. We first compared control hearts from both young (N = 10) and aged (N = 10) guinea pigs. Compared with young control hearts, aged control hearts showed significantly lower left ventricular performance (LVP) (84.2 +/- 1.6 v 76.0 +/- 1.5; P less than 0.003), +dP/dtmax (1417.5 +/- 52.4 v 1048 +/- 48.7; P less than 0.001), and -dP/dtmax (1079 +/- 79 v 916 +/- 27; P less than 0.001) at a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) of 10 mmHg. A 43% +/- 2% third-degree burn (Walker model) was studied in 20 young and 10 aged guinea pigs. The aged burn hearts showed significantly lower LVP (57.1 +/- 2.1 v 65.5 +/- 2.0; P less than 0.01) and +dP/dtmax (1026 +/- 66.4 v 1219 +/- 59.9; P less than 0.001) at an LVEDP of 10 mm Hg. In addition, LV function curves for the aged burn hearts were shifted downward and to the right of curves obtained from the young burn hearts (P less than 0.05). Contractile defects in the aged group were neither related to altered beating frequency nor to maximally effective increases in diastolic stretch. While increased extracellular calcium concentration (from 1 to 8 millimolar [mM]) increased LVP, +dP/dtmax, and -dP/dtmax in a dose-dependent manner in both young and aged burn hearts, absolute values of measured contractile performance were consistently less in the aged hearts compared with the young hearts at identical calcium concentrations. Finally, we examined the effects of thermal injury on contractile function within the aged group. Peak LVP and maximal rate of relaxation were uniformly decreased in all burn hearts compared with control aged hearts. The +dP/dtmax was not significantly altered by burn in this age group (burn: 1026 +/- 66; control: 1048 +/- 49). This study suggests that severe myocardial contractile changes resulting from a major thermal insult in subjects with already compromised hearts is likely a significant limiting factor in the response to burn shock.\r"

A laser Doppler flowmeter was used to study cutaneous perfusion for at least 72 hours in partial-thickness wounds on patients with burns of less than 15% TBSA and in experimental wounds of similar size on rats. Clinical wounds that healed without grafting consistently showed elevated perfusion levels which increased further within 72 hours, whereas wounds eventually requiring grafting experienced lower perfusion levels with no obvious pattern of increase. Differences between average flow levels for healing and nonhealing burns were statistically significant throughout the study period. Perfusion levels in experimental wounds were stratified according to burn severity, with shallower wounds showing a pattern of increase similar to the clinical wounds.\r"

A retrospective chart analysis of 101 pediatric admissions in 1985 demonstrated that childhood burns and follow-up requirements varied, depending on circumstances of injury, presence and behavior of caregivers, and the ability of parents or caregivers to assume responsibility for the child's supervision, safety, and health needs. We must view childrens' risk for injury as dependent upon the supervisory capacity of their parents, and continue to identify and develop specific interventions appropriate to each level of understanding and responsibility. Adequate documentation of the circumstances of injury and parent behavior are the key factors in determining level of risk and appropriate management.\r"

When medical evaluation reveals the possibility of child abuse, a social work assessment, including a developmental history of the child and psychosocial assessment of the family, is crucial. In addition, physicians must be well versed in the gathering of evidence for potential utilization by the legal system. This includes the obtainment of photographs and detailed documentation of the burn injury. A plan of evaluation and the effective coordination of services during hospitalization and following discharge have proven essential to meeting the best interests of the child.\r"

However, it is unclear which component of rehabilitation (emotional v physical) is predicted by this variable; furthermore, the predictive validity of preinjury mental health has not been compared with physical variables. The present study compared preinjury mental health, physical variables, and length of hospitalization in predicting the rehabilitation progress of 59 major burn patients at three-month follow-up. Preinjury mental health was assessed by the Rand Mental Health Form; physical status, by the Upper Extremity Index (standard measures of upper limb joint mobility); and hospital stay, by the number of days of acute hospitalization. These variables were assessed at the time of discharge. Three-month rehabilitation outcome was measured by the Sickness Impact Profile, a self-report inventory that evaluates patient outcome in 12 different areas. These areas were in turn placed in the categories of disability (ie, difficulties in functioning in activities of daily living; eating) handicap (ie, difficulties in functioning in general areas of living; employment) and mental health status. In predicting mental health status at three months, preinjury mental health was significantly correlated. In predicting physical disability, physical factors were found to be important. Conversely, physical status was not significantly related to mental health outcome, and preinjury mental health was not related to physical disability. The results indicate the importance of defining outcome when attempting to predict rehabilitation progress of burn patients.\r"

To assess the effectiveness of the MPA, a retrospective chart review was conducted. The study population consisted of 85 patients admitted to the center between 1974 and 1986 who had incurred burns to the perioral region or to the lower two thirds of the face. The chart analysis of 83 patients revealed that, with diligent and persistent use of the MPA, only one patient required surgical repair for the development of microstomia. The MPA has proved effective in decreasing the need for reconstructive procedures and in preventing the occurrence of microstomia.\r"

Thirty-five of these registries were in the form of handwritten logbooks, while 43 were personal computers with a wide variety of hardware and software. Uses of these registries include patient census and reports (64% of responders), clinical research (62%), patient care (61%), and, less common, quality assurance and education. Twenty-five facilities stated that they do not maintain a registry, but 22 (88%) of them indicated interest in developing one. It seems unlikely that a single system could be designed to fill the needs of all facilities, nor is it likely that existing registries can be \"networked\" successfully. This is due not only to the diversity of data in the existing registries, but also to the important differences in the way basic terminology is used in different facilities. For burn care facilities interested in developing their own registry, a selected list of successful representative registries is provided.\r"

Twenty young healthy volunteers (mean age 30 years) underwent continuous wave Doppler examination from the suprasternal notch at rest, during each stage of a standard exercise protocol and immediately after exercise. On completion of the control test, each subject received either 60 to 80 mg of propranolol or 120 mg of verapamil orally, and the same exercise protocol was repeated after 90 min. During the control test, values for modal velocity, acceleration and flow velocity integral all increased significantly from baseline (p less than 0.0002 for each). When exercise was repeated after propranolol administration, values for all Doppler measurements were significantly altered. Modal velocity at baseline was significantly lower after propranolol when compared with control (0.53 +/- 0.11 versus 0.63 +/- 0.17 m/s; p less than 0.0001). Similarly, modal velocity at maximal exercise was significantly lower after propranolol (1.11 +/- 0.2 versus 1.25 +/- 0.21 m/s; p less than 0.0001). The effect of propranolol on acceleration was even greater, with blunting of baseline (11.4 +/- 2 versus 15.4 +/- 5 m/s per s; p less than 0.0005) and exertional (33.4 +/- 10 versus 56.3 +/- 15 m/s per s; p less than 0.0001) acceleration. The flow velocity integral during exercise was greater after propranolol (14.1 +/- 3.1 versus 10.1 +/- 3.2 cm; p less than 0.0005) than during the control test. Verapamil failed to influence any Doppler-measured index of aortic blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A 28 year old man with a stable permanent idioventricular rhythm of 80 to 85 beats/min, with all the characteristics of a pacemaker, is described. This pacemaker was slowed by maneuvers that enhanced vagal tone, including carotid sinus massage, the postrelease phase of the Valsalva maneuver and phenylephrine. The pacemaker was also slowed by a cholinesterase inhibitor (edrophonium hydrochloride) and accelerated by a muscarinic receptor blocking drug (hyoscine butylbromide). The actions of these maneuvers and agents were independent of sympathetic tone as propranolol pretreatment did not alter their effects. Similarly, propranolol did not affect the pacemaker rate. The pacemaker was not dependent on a slow inward current because verapamil did not affect its rate. The pacemaker accelerated in response to increased sympathetic tone induced by exercise and upright tilting and to the adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. The pacemaker was localized to the high posterior septal region of the left ventricle underneath the mitral valve. This report describes in a man an idioventicular pacemaker that is innervated by sympathetic and vagal fibers and responsive to alterations in tone of both limbs of the autonomic nervous system. It offers the first clear proof that a ventricular pacemaker can be innervated and controlled by the vagus nerve and provides its location.\r"

  ".W": "Endarterectomy was performed in vivo using a high speed rotating abrasive-tipped catheter device in 11 normal canine coronary arteries. The device is designed to remove atheromatous material from diseased arteries by the abrasive action of its rotating tip. It was operated percutaneously from a femoral approach using conventional angioplasty guiding equipment. The rotating device was advanced over a guide wire from just beyond the tip of the guide catheter into the distal vessel. Six arteries were harvested immediately after endarterectomy and five were left in place for 7 +/- 2.8 days; in the latter group, the animals were maintained on a regimen of aspirin, 325 mg/day. Angiography before and after treatment demonstrated vessel patency in all cases. Caliper-measured luminal diameters were not significantly changed after endarterectomy. Histologic examination of pressure-fixed vessels showed extensive intimal loss and 20 to 30% loss of the internal elastic lamina. Medial damage was superficial and never exceeded 40% of the total medial thickness. There were no vessel perforations. Results of histologic study of the myocardium supplied by the treated vessels were normal without evidence of distal embolization or infarction. It is concluded that a high speed rotating abrasive device can be safely operated percutaneously in normal coronary arteries and results in minimal vessel damage and continued patency at 7 +/- 2.8 days.\r"

  ".U": "88187199\r", 
  ".W": "To assess whether the prophylactic administration of anipamil, a new calcium antagonist, protects the heart against the effects of ischemia and reperfusion, rats were injected intraperitoneally twice daily for 5 days with 5 mg/kg body weight of this drug. The heart was then isolated and perfused by the Langendorff technique. Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to monitor myocardial energy metabolism and intracellular pH during control perfusion and 30 min of total ischemia (37 degrees C), followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Pretreatment with anipamil altered neither left ventricular developed pressure under normoxic conditions nor the rate and extent of depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate during ischemia. Intracellular acidification, however, was attenuated. On reperfusion, hearts from anipamil-pretreated animals recovered significantly better than untreated hearts with respect to replenishment of ATP and creatine phosphate stores, restitution of low levels of intracellular inorganic phosphate and recovery of left ventricular function and coronary flow. Intracellular pH recovered rapidly to preischemic levels, whereas in untreated hearts a complex intracellular inorganic phosphate peak indicated the existence of areas of different pH within the myocardium. It is concluded that anipamil pretreatment protects the heart against some of the deleterious effects of ischemia and reperfusion. Because this protection occurred in the absence of a negative inotropic effect during normoxia, it cannot be attributed to an energy-sparing effect during ischemia. Therefore, alternative mechanisms of action are to be considered.\r"

In five adult myocardial preparations, d-sotalol produced concentration-dependent increases in action potential duration at 50% (APD50) and 90% (APD90) repolarization and effective refractory period. In six neonatal myocardial preparations, d-sotalol produced a biphasic response; APD50, APD90 and effective refractory period decreased at 10(-6) and 10(-5)M. At 10(-4)M, these values increased significantly but to a lesser extent compared with values in adults. In seven adult Purkinje fibers, d-Sotalol significantly increased APD50, APD90 and effective refractory period in a concentration-dependent manner. All six neonatal Purkinje fibers responded in a biphasic manner, with values for APD50, APD90 and effective refractory period being less than control at 10(-6)M and near control values at 10(-5)M. At 10(-4)M, these variables were significantly increased, but to a lesser extent than in adult preparations. Our data confirm the typical class III effects of d-sotalol in adult cardiac tissues. The shortening of repolarization and refractoriness at lower drug concentrations in developing cardiac tissues may relate to age-dependent differences in cellular ionic function and basic electrophysiology.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of distant potentials on local epicardial unipolar electrograms were examined utilizing a model that enabled both ventricles to be paced independently in five dogs. The right ventricular isolation procedure electrically isolates the right from the left ventricle. Right ventricular electrograms were separated into their local (right ventricular) and distant (left ventricular) components by altering the left-right ventricular pacing interval. Waveform configuration, peak to peak amplitude, magnitude of the slope and timing of the fastest downstroke were carefully evaluated at each electrode site, both with and without the presence of distant left ventricular potentials. Except for the timing of the fastest downstroke, all of these variables were significantly altered by distant potentials. Although the slope of the fastest downstroke was significantly affected by distant potentials, it remained a sensitive indicator of local versus distant activation. All electrograms of local right ventricular activation had a slope magnitude greater than 2.5 mV/2 ms whereas none of the right ventricular electrograms containing only distant left ventricular activity had a magnitude greater than 2.5 mV/2 ms. Computer-generated electrograms were calculated by digitally summing the recorded local right and distant left ventricular components. The simulated electrograms correlated well with the recorded electrograms during synchronous ventricular pacing. Thus, the configuration, amplitude and slope of unipolar electrodes were profoundly influenced by distant potentials. The timing of the fastest downstroke is largely independent of the effect of distant potentials and most closely represents local activation. The magnitude of the slope of the recorded electrogram accurately distinguishes local from distant activation.\r"

In this case series of eight patients (aged 10 to 53 years) with drug-resistant right atrial focal tachycardia, results of electrophysiologic studies, surgical techniques and long-term follow-up are described. Atrial focal tachycardia was reproduced during electrophysiologic study, and endocardial mapping localized the earliest onset of atrial activation in the right atrium in all patients. Epicardial mapping confirmed the location of atrial tachycardia foci in seven of eight patients whose tachycardia was inducible intraoperatively. Of four patients treated with epicardial cryoablation alone, two had recurrent tachycardia and required a second procedure. None have had arrhythmia recurrence. In all four patients after right atrial excision (two of whom had intraoperative recurrence of atrial focal tachycardia after epicardial cryoablation alone), there has been no recurrence during a clinical follow-up period of 11 to 67 months (mean 30). It is concluded that in adult patients 1) electrophysiologic study with endocardial and epicardial mapping permits successful surgical treatment of atrial focal tachycardia; 2) epicardial cryoablation alone may be associated with recurrence of atrial focal tachycardia either intraoperatively or postoperatively; and 3) subtotal right atrial resection appears to be a well tolerated procedure with no long-term recurrence of atrial focal tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of dopamine-1 agonist therapy in severe hypertension, blood pressure, heart rate, catecholamines and left ventricular function were studied in 18 patients (10 with renal disease) with diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mm Hg (range 124 to 160) after intravenous fenoldopam therapy. Constant infusions of fenoldopam were titrated upward every 10 to 20 min from an initial dose of 0.1 microgram/kg per min to a maximal dose of 0.9 microgram/kg per min. The therapeutic goal of a supine diastolic blood pressure of less than 110 mm Hg was achieved in every patient within 1 h at an average dose of 0.34 +/- 0.22 microgram/kg per min. Blood pressure decreased from 214/134 +/- 33/10 mm Hg at baseline to 170/96 +/- 29/7 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001) at 3 h, whereas heart rate increased from 77 +/- 23 to 88 +/- 21 beats/min (p less than 0.01). Plasma norepinephrine increased during the fenoldopam infusion; epinephrine and dopamine levels did not change. Two indexes of left ventricular function (end-systolic dimension and isovolumic relaxation time) improved during the fenoldopam infusion, but mitral flow velocities during ventricular filling were unchanged. Side effects of intravenous fenoldopam were mild, transient and associated with the marked vasodilatory properties of the drug. Thus, fenoldopam is safe and effective as a parenteral monotherapy in patients with severe essential and renovascular hypertension. Preliminary data suggest that blood pressure reduction with selective dopamine-1 agonist therapy is accompanied by improved left ventricular function.\r"

  ".W": "In this study of the limits of reversibility of left ventricular function after aortic valve replacement for aortic regurgitation, measurements were made of pre- and postoperative coronary blood flow and left ventricular volumes. Eighteen patients who had undergone aortic valve replacement for pure aortic regurgitation using the Bjork-Shiley valve or the Bicerval valve were restudied an average of 8 +/- 3 months after surgery. Postoperative left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes returned to near normal values. The slight left ventricular wall thickening apparent before surgery remained unchanged after surgery and, consequently, left ventricular mass, though somewhat reduced, remained abnormally high. Ejection fraction, which was low preoperatively, returned to normal postoperatively. Total coronary sinus blood flow decreased after surgery, but coronary sinus blood flow per 100 g of left ventricular mass increased. This recovery of coronary flow per unit mass was believed to cause the improvement in left ventricular function. A significant correlation was found between postoperative systolic function and preoperative left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, wall thickness and, especially, left ventricular mass, the latter indicating that, if preoperative left ventricular mass is less than 350 g/m2, postoperative improvement of systolic function is attainable. Another significant correlation was indicated by measurements of coronary sinus blood flow per 100 g of left ventricular mass. If this is greater than 35 ml/min before surgery, a postoperative improvement in systolic function to within the normal range may be expected.\r"

The women were older than the men and had a risk factor profile dominated by hypertension and hypercholesterolemia rather than smoking. Women had a higher rate of unstable angina than did men after adjustment for age distribution. Women with acute infarction showed a higher rate of complications, which was associated with their greater age. They had a higher in-hospital mortality rate (12.6%) than did men (6.6%, p = 0.002). A logistic regression was used to adjust mortality and complication rates for differences in age between the sexes. When this was done, women and men had similar in-hospital prognoses. It is concluded that differences in risk factor profile may result in differences between the sexes in the expression of acute coronary heart disease, but that gender as such does not exert an independent influence on short-term prognosis in this disease.\r"

In both study groups, lower body negative pressure induced a significant decrease in right atrial pressure, left ventricular filling pressure and cardiac output, an increase in systemic vascular resistance and no change in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. In normal subjects, there was also a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine concentration (from 294 +/- 39 to 421 +/- 47 pg/ml, p less than 0.01). This increase was accompanied by a reduction in coronary blood flow, assessed by the continuous thermodilution method (from 101 +/- 5 to 79 +/- 4 ml/min, p less than 0.05). An increase in coronary vascular resistance (from 0.865 +/- 0.1 to 1.107 +/- 0.1 mm Hg/ml per min, p less than 0.05) and in myocardial oxygen consumption was detected in normal subjects during cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading. In contrast, in hypertensive patients, -10 mm Hg lower body negative pressure failed to induce any change in plasma norepinephrine, coronary blood flow or vascular resistance. Intravenous propranolol administration caused no significant change in the systemic hemodynamic response to -10 mm Hg lower body negative pressure in either study group, but it did abolish the decrease in coronary flow and the increase in plasma norepinephrine, coronary vascular resistance and myocardial oxygen consumption observed in normal subjects in control conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Previous studies of these effects have been of limited value because they were performed with 1) imaging techniques that, like cineventriculography or radionuclide ventriculography, do not allow beat to beat monitoring of left ventricular filling throughout the entire ischemic attack; and 2) exercise, which, even if effective in inducing myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease, also considerably shortens cycle length, thus leading to additional nonischemic filling alterations. To overcome these limitations, left ventricular filling was studied by means of Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of transmitral flow velocities before and immediately after rapid atrial pacing in 17 patients. Eight patients had coronary artery disease but did not develop ischemia (ST depression greater than or equal to 1.5 mm) during atrial pacing (Group 1) whereas nine had coronary artery disease and developed ischemia during atrial pacing (Group 2). No differences were observed from rest to postpacing in any of the filling variables considered in Group 1 patients. In contrast, a significant rearrangement of left ventricular filling occurred during ischemia in Group 2 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Rapid atrial pacing confirms myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease when angina is provoked, and is accompanied by an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. In such cases, abnormalities in the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) are often not apparent. To enhance detection of subendocardial ischemia during rapid atrial pacing, local unipolar electrograms were recorded from the tip of a 0.025 in. (0.064 cm) diameter guidewire positioned against the endocardial surface of potentially ischemic regions. Endocardial electrograms, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and multiple surface ECG leads were recorded during rapid atrial pacing in 21 patients with coronary artery disease. Before pacing, endocardial electrograms in all 21 patients were free of ST elevation. Marked ST elevation was apparent in 17 of the 21 patients after rapid atrial pacing and could be abolished by nitroglycerin. Moreover, in several patients, endocardial ST elevation after rapid atrial pacing was abolished after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the critically stenosed artery supplying the ischemic region of myocardium. It is concluded that ST elevation in the endocardial electrogram after rapid atrial pacing is a reflection of myocardial ischemia and may be a sensitive marker of pacing-induced ischemia appearing earlier than angina, postpacing increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or ST depression in the surface ECG.\r"

  ".U": "88187224\r", 
  ".W": "Most studies investigating the ability of exercise two-dimensional echocardiography to identify patients with coronary artery disease have included patients with left ventricular wall motion abnormalities at rest. This has the effect of increasing sensitivity because patients with only abnormalities at rest are detected. To determine the diagnostic utility of exercise echocardiography in patients with normal wall motion at rest, 64 patients were studied with exercise echocardiography in conjunction with routine treadmill exercise testing before coronary cineangiography. All 24 patients who had no angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease had a negative exercise echocardiogram (100% specificity). Nine of 40 patients with coronary artery disease (defined as greater than or equal to 50% narrowing of at least one major vessel) also had a negative exercise echocardiogram (78% sensitivity). Of the nine patients with a false negative exercise echocardiographic study, six had single vessel disease. Among 25 patients with single vessel disease, exercise echocardiography was significantly more sensitive (p = 0.01) than treadmill exercise testing alone (76 versus 36%, respectively). Among 15 patients with multivessel disease, the two tests demonstrated similar sensitivity (80%). In conclusion, exercise echocardiography is highly specific and moderately sensitive for the detection of coronary artery disease in patients with normal wall motion at rest. Although exercise echocardiography is significantly more sensitive than treadmill exercise electrocardiographic testing alone in patients with single vessel disease, the two tests are similar in their ability to detect coronary artery disease in patients with multivessel disease and normal wall motion at rest.\r"

Analysis of the data revealed significant differences in mean peak-to-trough fluctuations of serum theophylline concentrations between the formulations of SR theophylline, which varied from 60% to 106% of trough concentration (p less than 0.0001, analysis of variance). On at least one occasion in every subject, switching between brands of SR theophylline was responsible for raising the serum theophylline concentrations outside the accepted therapeutic range, and this was associated with symptoms of toxicity in five of the subjects. Worsening pulmonary functions were observed in two of the subjects whose switching resulted in lowered theophylline concentrations. Many of the formulation-related changes in theophylline concentrations appeared to be idiosyncratic and could not be predicted by the overall bioavailability differences between the drugs. These results argue against the open substitution of these formulations and suggest that if patients are switched between different brands of SR theophylline, their serum theophylline concentrations need to be closely monitored.\r"

All beds were in regular use during the study period. Dust from mattresses and EHBs was collected monthly and analyzed for D by microscopy. Blankets were turned on during daytime and were washed every 3 months. For each bed the median concentration of D during the entire period was related to initial value. In the beds supplied with blankets, the overall median was 52% compared to 122% in the control beds (p less than 0.05). The difference between the two groups of beds was observed within the first month. Major antigens from D were reduced to 32% in the beds supplied with blankets and increased to 120% in the control beds (p less than 0.05). Climatic conditions were measured beneath the blanket in a spare bed. When beds were covered by eiderdown, temperature was increased by 26 degrees C, and the relative humidity was decreased by 24% within 3 hours. In conclusion, EHBs appear capable of reducing relative humidity and concentration of house dust mites on mattress surfaces.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether leukotrienes (LTs) are released into the bronchial fluid of patients with symptomatic asthma, bronchial lavage was carried out in 17 patients with mild to severe asthma and nine healthy subjects without asthma. LTE4 was detected in 15 of the 17 patients with asthma with reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The identify of LTE4 was confirmed by ultraviolet spectrometry and by positive ion fast atom-bombardment mass spectrometry. LTD4 was found in two patients and 20-OH-LTB4 in 12 patients. No LTs were detectable in the lavage fluid from any of the healthy subjects without asthma. The finding of LTs in bronchial lavage fluid from the patients with asthma despite bronchodilator and/or corticosteroid therapy suggests that these compounds may be important in asthma. However, the presence of significant quantities of LTE4 in patients with mild asthma requiring only intermittent bronchodilator therapy for control and the lack of correlation between LTE4 and pulmonary function also suggests that other factors may be important in determining the net end organ response. The present study points to the importance of studying the whole spectrum of mediators that are released. Analysis of bronchial lavage fluid may be useful in determining the relative role of these mediators and the effect of pharmacologic intervention.\r"

We have identified 10 patients (six male and four female subjects, aged 1 to 54 years) with AD and contact sensitivity to a variety of aeroallergens. Marked improvement in skin symptomatology was noted when these patients were removed from their usual environment. The patients had markedly positive immediate wheal-and-flare reactions to a variety of aeroallergen extracts in response to prick tests and were subsequently patch tested on uninvolved skin with aeroallergen extracts (1:20 wt/vol, 50% glycerine) that elicited positive prick tests. Patch tests were applied for 48 hours, removed, and then were interpreted 24 hours later. Fifty percent glycerine was used as a negative control. Significant delayed cutaneous responses to a variety of aeroallergens were noted: house dust mite, tree, grass and weed pollens, animal danders, and various molds. Positive delayed cutaneous responses correlated strongly with aeroallergens identified in the patient's environment and/or suspected by the patients as provocateurs of their AD. Delayed cutaneous reactions were negative to aeroallergens not historically relevant to their AD. We conclude that aeroallergen contact may play an important role in selected patients with AD. The demonstration of immediate and delayed cutaneous responses in AD suggests both IgE and cell-mediated hypersensitivity as contributory mechanisms.\r"

The antibody levels were determined with ELISA in sera obtained from mothers at delivery, and from their babies at birth, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 18 months. High levels of maternal IgG, IgA, or IgM antibodies to food at delivery did not appear to protect the baby against development of atopic disease. Maternal avoidance of cow's milk and egg during pregnancy had no significant influence on the level of food antibodies in cord blood, but the mother's intake of these foods during lactation affected the immunologic response of the baby, not only to these antigens but also to gliadin as well. Babies with minimal cow's milk exposure before 6 months had significantly lower levels of IgG to beta-lactoglobulin than babies regularly exposed to cow's milk. We conclude that maternal elimination diet during lactation influences the immunologic response of the baby, but if this prevents the development of atopic disease or just delays the immunologic maturation remains to be evaluated.\r"

By regression analysis, only the presence of strictures or large ulcers correlated with time. First quartile times suggest that small ulcers and granulomas were the earliest lesions of those studied. Regeneration, metaplasia, submucosal lymphoid follicles, and transmural inflammation appear to be sequelae of ulceration. Sinuses and strictures are late complications of ulceration. The results confirm clinical, radiological, and subjective pathological impressions of the progress of the disease and suggest a central role for ulceration in this disease.\r"

During the early hospitalization period, daily intakes of calories (1,826 +/- 1,050 kcal) and protein (1.5 +/- 0.4 g/kg) were not sufficient to maintain energy (-548 +/- 964 kcal/day) and nitrogen (-1.5 +/- 3.9 g/day) balances. Energy expenditure and nitrogen losses at the end of the study were similar to the values obtained on admission, but because of a voluntary increase in caloric (by 42%) and protein (by 37%) intake during the hospitalization both energy balance (+434 +/- 409 kcal/day) and nitrogen balance (+4.6 +/- 6.5 g/day) (p less than 0.05) improved. These results suggest that, although the metabolic impact of active ulcerative colitis is mild, it does result in negative energy and nitrogen balances. Dietary intake can be voluntarily increased during hospitalization to improve energy and nitrogen equilibrium.\r"

On stepwise discriminant analysis, only C-reactive protein distinguished proctosigmoiditis from more improved the discrimination.

We evaluated whether hyperplastic polyps could serve as a marker for patients who might benefit from colonoscopy. We retrospectively reviewed 1,588 consecutive colonoscopy reports and hospital charts on 1,407 different patients examined between May 1983 and August 1985: 242 patients had adenomas, and 94 had hyperplastic polyps. Of patients with hyperplastic polyps 93.6% had concomitant adenomas, as compared with 35.7% of those without, p less than 0.001. Adenomas proximal to the rectosigmoid were found in 61.7% of patients with hyperplastic polyps and in 25.3% of those without, p less than 0.001. Patients with hyperplastic polyps in the rectosigmoid had proximal adenomas more frequently (64.7%) than did those without rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps (29.4%), p less than 0.001. We conclude that patients with hyperplastic polyps are more likely to have adenomas, and patients with rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps are more likely to have proximal adenomas. Based on these preliminary data, we believe that the finding of hyperplastic polyps in the rectosigmoid might justify full colonoscopy and that this should be studied further.\r"

Starvation could deplete the protective factor glutathione, thus augmenting hepatotoxicity. In the therapeutic misadventure group, four of six patients developed acute tubular necrosis, as compared to two of seven in the suicide group. One patient died in each group.

One such antibody, 25E11, which bound to all NK cells and a subset of monocytes, consistently led to enhancement of in vitro hemopoiesis when 25E11+ cells were depleted by complement or the FACS. In cultures maximally stimulated by erythropoietin and human placental conditioned medium, depletion of 25E11+ cells from beta-thalassemic PBMC resulted in up to a fourfold enhancement of multi-potential and pure erythroid colonies and a twofold enhancement of non-erythroid colonies when compared with C-only treated cells. This enhancement of in vitro hemopoiesis was also observed with cells from normal bone marrow, cord blood, and peripheral blood. The enhancement of in vitro hemopoiesis was abrogated by removal of either adherent cells or monocytes using Leu M3 antibody and C lysis. The data presented herein suggest that NK cells and a subset of monocytes may exert a negative regulatory control on both granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis. Consequently, the number of progenitor and multipotential cells in cultures of unfractionated cell populations may be greatly underestimated.\r"

In fact, a microtubule and microfilament (MF) rearrangement in the lytic sequence of CTL and NK cells has been observed. In particular, MF seem to be related to the binding phase, because MF inhibitors suppress the binding of NK cells to the target, whereas microtubule inhibitors suppress only the killing phase. In this paper, the distribution of two cytoskeleton components, actin and alpha- and beta-tubulin, has been studied in PBL from AIDS patients, who maintain the capacity to bind to the target cell line K562 but are not able to kill it. PBL were labeled with mAb to these two cytoskeleton components, and then indirect immunofluorescence was used to visualize their distribution in the conjugates. A normal polarization of actin in the effector PBL was found, whereas no tubulin rearrangement was evident in the effector and target cells. On the contrary, in conjugates of PBL or large granular lymphocytes from normal donors and K562, a polarization of actin in the effector cell and a polarization of tubulin both in the effector and in the target cells, at the site of the attachment, was evident. These data suggest that a deficiency of tubulin rearrangement may underlie the inability of the NK cells from AIDS patients to kill their target.\r"

Whereas the intact mAb released histamine from the RBL-2H3 cells, the Fab was inactive. The addition of the Fab fragments to RBL-2H3 inhibited the IgE-mediated histamine release reaction. The Fab fragments also inhibited in vivo passive cutaneous reactions in rats when injected intradermally either before or after IgE. The injection of the mAb Fab i.v. before the injection of the IgE into the skin sites also inhibited reactions, although it was less effective. The results demonstrate that anti-R antibodies can be used as a model for inhibiting immediate hypersensitivity reactions.\r"

Two co-isogenic strains, B10.D2/nSn (C5 sufficient) and B10.D2/oSn (C5 deficient), which are genetically identical except for the C5 gene locus, were immunized with acetylcholine receptors (AChR) in CFA to induce myasthenia gravis. Both strains had equivalent concentration of serum autoantibodies to muscle AChR and antibodies bound to muscle AChR. C5-sufficient B10.D2/nSn, but not C5-deficient B10.D2/oSn, demonstrated increased incidence of clinical disease and death and lost significant amounts of muscle AChR. Therefore, C5 deficiency in B10.D2/oSn prevented EAMG. C5 gene, which codes for C component C5, may influence EAMG pathogenesis through activation of the terminal lytic C sequence (C5 to C9) required for muscle AChR destruction, which is the primary pathology.\r"

The 35S-labeled proteoglycans were extracted by the addition of detergent and 4 M guanidine-HCl, and separated from unincorporated precursor by Sephadex G-50 chromatography. 35S-Proteoglycans chromatographed over Sepharose 4B with a Kav of 0.48. 35S-Glycosaminoglycans separated from the parent 35S-proteoglycans by beta-elimination and chromatographed over Sepharose 4B with a Kav of 0.63. Characterization of 35S-proteoglycans by chondroitin ABC lyase treatment revealed approximately 36% of the proteoglycan to be composed of chondroitin sulfates. Analysis by HPLC of component disaccharides liberated by chondroitin ABC lyase using an amino-cyano-substituted silica column indicated that the chondroitin sulfates consisted of the monosulfated A disaccharide (GlcUA----GaINAc4SO4) (75%) and the over-sulfated E disaccharide (GlcUA----GaINAc4,6-diSO4) (25%). Nitrous acid/heparinase-susceptible heparin proteoglycans accounted for approximately 62% of the total 35S-proteoglycans present in the HLMC. Proteoglycans remaining after exposure of the original proteoglycan extract to either heparinase or chondroitin ABC lyase were of similar size, suggesting that the majority of heparin and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans were on separate protein cores. Proteoglycans extracted from HLMC were protease insensitive. Hence, in addition to heparin proteoglycans, HLMC synthesize a hitherto unrecognized quantity of chondroitin sulfate E proteoglycans.\r"

LGL tumor cells displayed modest spontaneous killing of rodent trypanosomes but were considerably more effective in the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity mode in the presence of specific antibody. The trypanosomes were quite resistant to lysis by the cytolysin-containing granules, compared with other types of cells. The slow inefficient lysis that occurred in the presence of divalent cations involved granule concentrations thousands of times greater than was required for lysis of SRBC. Rodent trypanosomes were significantly more susceptible to lysis when divested of their surface glycoprotein coats. In the absence (or near absence) of divalent cations, a substance (or substances) present in the granules rapidly destroyed intact and nude trypanosomes; this activity probably was not associated with cytolysin. The rate and efficiency with which the divalent cation-independent substance destroyed three species of trypanosomes indicate that this material deserves further study with an eye to its potential use as a therapeutic agent.\r"

The Ly-6 locus contains multiple tightly linked genes which have been mapped to a specific region on murine chromosome 15. The present approach to further define the Ly-6 Ag is based on the transfection of cloned genes and identification of the expressed products by using mAb. Screening of Ly-6 related chromosomal clones revealed one that contains a gene that is closely related to yet distinct from that of the previously characterized Ly-6E.1 protein. Transfection of this chromosomal clone into COS cells shows that it contains the gene encoding Ly-6C.1 determinants. The expression of the transfected Ly-6C.1 gene is enhanced in COS cells following treatment with mouse IFN. Characterization of the DNA sequence of the Ly-6C.1 gene has established that it consists of four exons, the first of which is untranslated. Several possible regulatory elements have been identified in the putative promoter region of this gene (5' to the first exon), including a 28-base sequence closely resembling the consensus IFN-responsive sequence found in the promoter regions of other IFN-responsive genes.\r"

The result of occlusal adjustment was assessed immediately after completion of treatment. The effect of treatment on globus symptoms was assessed 2 to 3 months later in a double-blind study. Binomial tests showed that there was a significant association between the success of occlusal adjustment and disappearance of the globus symptom.

Two approaches to medical ethics may be used to address this issue: one takes a strong rights-oriented position; the other takes a best-outcome position. The interests that patients have in knowing relate to both schools of thought. The authors surveyed 224 adult patients who were waiting to see their physicians. The findings showed that over 90 percent of patients want to be told of the diagnosis. Reasons for wanting to be told included making plans for care, obtaining a second opinion, and settling family matters. No demographic markers could be used to predict who would not be told. Even though several patients indicated that reading a case description made them feel suicidal, reactions to not being told are generally negative. Following either ethical approach leads to the conclusion that patients ought to be told. Subjects' interests in whom else should be told were also recorded, raising questions of confidentiality.\r"

Two mailings produced an 82 percent response rate. A four-year residency was favored by 32 percent of recent graduates, 20 percent of program directors, and 34 percent of third-year residents. Over 60 percent of residents and recent graduates would have entered a family practice program had the residency been of four years' duration. Perceived barriers to a four-year residency included lack of resources, loss of appeal, and the additional time commitment. Respondents were most willing to complete a fourth year of residency to receive additional training in orthopedics, obstetrics, gynecology, and pediatrics. Many respondents believed that the additional year would be helpful in obtaining hospital privileges in obstetrics and in coronary care and intensive care units. This study provides information useful in discussions regarding extending residency training.\r"

Three hundred one patients with clinical stages (CS) I or II HD entered in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) clinical trials were included in this study. All relevant data and long-term follow-up were available for these patients. A stepwise logistic regression was performed to assess the prognostic value of ESR changes independent of other prognostic parameters and treatment. The incidence of early relapse was found to be significantly increased in patients in whom ESR remained elevated (greater than 30 mm at one hour) after completion of therapy, regardless of the value before therapy. This was true whether the ESR was elevated in plateau fashion, oscillating between normal and abnormal, or was lower than at onset, but still abnormal. Moreover, early relapse predicted by elevated ESR posttherapy was associated with poor survival despite subsequent initiation of combination chemotherapy. Thus, the persistence of an abnormal ESR appears to be a reliable indicator for high probability of early relapse and subsequent poor prognosis. This might be introduced as a prognostic variable in the design of future therapy programs for HD.\r"

Fifty-five group III evaluable patients (pts) less than 15 years of age with tumor size greater than 5 cm in diameter, without high-risk features of CNS involvement, and 15 group IV RMS pts were randomized to receive VAC as primary chemotherapy (CT): VCR, 1.5 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) days 1 and 8; CYC, 275 mg/m2 IV days 1 through 5; and ACT-D, 0.45 mg/m2 IV days 1 through 5 every 28 days for three cycles (33 pts), or VAC-M: CYC, 150 mg/m2 intramuscularly (IM) days 1 through 7; VCR, 2.0 mg/m2 IV day 8; and ACT-D, 1.7 mg/m2 IV day 8 every 21 days for four cycles (37 pts). Major responses (complete plus partial responses [PR]) were obtained in 67% of the VAC pts and in 70% of the VAC-M pts. Toxic effects were low, and no increased toxicity was observed in pts treated with high, single-dose ACT-D. These results confirm the effectiveness and feasibility of single, high doses of ACT-D with the advantage of requiring less pt hospitalization.\r"

In this dose-ranging trial, 44 patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy known to produce nausea and vomiting (including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) received three intravenous (IV) infusions of GR-C507/75 every two hours beginning 30 minutes before chemotherapy. Ten dosage levels were explored, ranging from 0.04 mg/kg to 0.35 mg/kg in each of the three infusions. Toxicities were mild and included sedation, dizziness, headache, transient elevations of SGOT or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and dry mouth. No akathisia or acute dystonic reactions were observed. Antiemetic effects were seen in patients receiving cisplatin at 120 mg/m2. GR-C507/75 can be safely administered on this schedule at IV dosages up to 0.35 mg/kg in patients receiving chemotherapy. Further studies of this agent at higher dosages and by different schedules are appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "Thioguanine (TG) is an antimetabolite with established antileukemic activity. The most pharmacologically rational manner of TG administration is continuous infusion. Intraperitoneal (IP) delivery of TG provides the opportunity to definitively test the concept of high-dose, long-term antimetabolite administration. The high systemic clearance and in vitro activity of TG against ovarian carcinoma suggested that it would be an excellent candidate for IP administration as a prolonged infusion. TG was administered as a 48-hour continuous IP infusion in this phase I/pharmacokinetic study. TG infusions were administered using a portable, programmable pump (Pancretec Provider Model 2000; Pancretec, Inc, San Diego). Twenty-five patients were treated. At a dose of 900 mg/m2/48 h, TG produced unacceptably severe myelosuppression. The dose-limiting toxicity was granulo-cytopenia. Other toxicities were mild: emesis, alopecia, skin rashes, and photosensitivity reactions. IP TG did not produce chemical peritonitis, hepatotoxicity, or mucositis. The pharmacokinetics of IP TG were determined in 16 patients. TG levels were measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). At steady state, the mean peritoneal to plasma TG ratio was 1,800 at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Steady-state TG levels in the peritoneal cavity and plasma were 2 mmol/L and 1.1 mumol/L, respectively, at a dose of 744 mg/m2. The elimination half-life of TG from the peritoneal cavity was one hour. TG exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range investigated. Encouraging clinical activity was seen with IP TG. There was one partial response (PR) and four minor responses (MR). TG can be safely administered by the IP route. The recommended dose for phase II testing is 744 mg/m2/48 h. IP TG has a favorable pharmacokinetic advantage and has demonstrated encouraging clinical activity. Further studies of IP TG infusions are warranted.\r"

All patients underwent wide local excision for a primary extremity melanoma of 1.5 mm or greater in thickness. A proportional hazards regression analysis for recurrence of disease and survival identified the significant prognostic factors, of which tumor thickness was the most important. Corrected for these factors, it was not possible to demonstrate a statistically significant effect for perfusion in terms of time to limb recurrence (P = .61), time to regional lymph node metastasis (P = .11), time to distant metastasis (P = .73), disease-free interval (P = .42), and survival (P = .90). No statistically significant differences were seen for adjuvant perfusion in any of the subgroups.\r"

The tumor had no predilection for sex, and the patients' age at diagnosis ranged from 15 to 39 years. The lesions were located in the lateral and/or third ventricles. Total removal of the tumor was performed in three patients, and the remaining three underwent partial resection. Postoperative irradiation was given to five patients. A follow-up study revealed that five patients were free of recurrent tumor at 15 to 227 months after treatment, and one was alive with disease 25 months after surgery. Histologically, all tumors were composed of small uniform cells, with perinuclear halos and regular round nuclei. Tumor cells were sometimes arranged around nucleus-free fibrillary zones. Mitoses were infrequent. Ultrastructurally, neoplastic cells had round nuclei with dispersed heterochromatin and organelle-sparse cytoplasm containing occasional microtubules, 20 to 25 nm in diameter, and scattered dense-core vesicles, 100 to 200 nm in diameter. Cell processes containing dense-core and clear vesicles were frequently present. Thus, these neoplasms should be considered neuronal in origin, and should be classified as \"intraventricular neurocytomas.\"\r"

Surgical decompression of the orbit was reserved for patients who failed to respond to medical treatment. Eleven patients (nine women and two men) were followed for periods from 3 to 48 months. Visual loss was the commonest presentation and the main indication for surgery. All patients had failed to respond to medical therapy, consisting of steroid and/or radiation therapy. Three patients had previously undergone orbital decompressions with limited success. Six patients had preoperative visual acuity of worse than 20/200. Preoperative exophthalmos ranged from 24 to 35 mm (normal 16 mm). The orbits were approached by a bifrontal scalp flap with exposure of the temporal and infratemporal fossae. The orbital roof was approached transcranially. The posterior wall of the frontal sinus was removed together with the mucous lining. To maximize the decompression, the periosteum surrounding the orbital contents was incised, allowing the contents to prolapse through the newly created windows into the maxillary antrum, temporal fossa, anterior cranial fossa, and nose. During the past 3 years, 22 orbits in 11 patients have been decompressed by this technique. Symptomatic relief was obtained in all but one patient who still had significant exophthalmos with keratitis, but did have a dramatic improvement in vision. The decrease in exophthalmos ranged from 1 to 13 mm (mean 7 mm). The most dramatic improvement was in vision, with postoperative acuity of 20/20 to 20/30 in all but two patients. There were no deaths and no major morbidity.\r"

To provide simultaneous access to both the intracranial and extracranial aspects of these tumors, a temporal or frontotemporal craniotomy may be combined with a lateral exposure of the infratemporal fossa. The approach, which is readily achieved by a neurosurgeon and an otolaryngologist acting as a team, involves a unilateral frontotemporal incision extended inferiorly onto the neck, a lateral facial flap reflected anteriorly, and transection of the zygoma followed by its reflection inferolaterally with the temporalis muscle. This exposure provides excellent visualization of both the intradural and extradural aspects of the anterior portion of the cavernous sinus, allowing for an aggressive resection of neoplasms involving this region. Experience with this procedure is reported here in the management of nine patients: three with nasopharyngeal angiofibromas, three with low-grade malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract, and three with sphenoid ridge meningiomas.\r"

Two patients who died postoperatively were excluded from analysis. Eleven patients had mixed tumors, with a minor astrocytic component. The overall survival rates for the 29 patients with pure oligodendroglioma were 61% and 33% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; these rates for the 11 patients with mixed tumors were 57% and 38% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The 10-year survival rate for 14 patients with pure oligodendroglioma who received greater than 45 Gy irradiation was 56% versus 18% for 11 patients who did not receive postoperative irradiation (p = 0.09). Nine patients with mixed tumor who received more than 45 Gy postoperatively had survival rates similar to those for the 14 patients with pure tumors irradiated with more than 45 Gy (p = 0.89). All patients who died of their tumor had evidence of intracranial recurrence. One patient, who did not receive initial postoperative irradiation, also had clinical and myelographic evidence of spinal seeding. All five patients examined postmortem had tumor recurrence at the primary site; one patient also had intraventricular seeding. Six of the 10 patients with pure oligodendroglioma who had a repeat biopsy at the time of tumor recurrence or at postmortem examination showed histological progression to an anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme. Based on this study, adult patients with pure or mixed oligodendroglioma currently are treated with partial-brain irradiation to a dose of about 60 Gy. In general, children are treated with partial-brain irradiation to about 50 Gy.\r"

  ".W": "To provide baseline information for the \"local\" therapy of the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), whole-brain histological sections of 15 untreated GBM's were studied to determine the distribution of neoplastic cells. These findings were then compared with the computerized tomography (CT) scans in 11 cases in order to determine the extent to which the peripheral portion of the neoplasm can be estimated by the presence of a low-density area without contrast enhancement. The results of the histological study confirmed the marked heterogeneity of GBM's and disclosed a great variability in the geometry, extent, and character of the peripheral \"infiltrating\" margin. In spite of the widely held concept that glioblastomas are localized within 2 cm of the contrast-enhanced rim, there were three cases in this two-dimensional study in which this distance was exceeded, and it seems likely that three-dimensional reconstructions would have detected additional cases in which neoplastic cells extended beyond this arbitrary limit. Only three of the 15 GBM's were restricted to the distribution of one internal carotid or one vertebral artery. To the extent that the neoplasms in the present series are representative, this suggests that glioblastomas will be difficult to treat successfully by intra-arterial therapy using existing therapeutic agents. Correlations of histological sections with the CT scans revealed that the vast majority of the neoplastic tissue was contained within the contrast-enhancing and \"peritumoral\" areas of low density, but that in five cases fingers of neoplasm extended for short distances beyond the outer margin of the latter region. This indicates that the distribution of cells of a GBM cannot be inferred from CT images since the \"peritumoral\" area of low density can over- or underestimate the extent of the lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of high-grade astrocytoma includes surgery, chemotherapy, and various methods of irradiation. Radiation therapy usually results in necrosis and edema around the primary tumor site. Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) and standard radionuclide imaging techniques are unable to reliably distinguish recurrent tumor from necrosis or edema since these images depict localization of contrast material or tracer, which primarily depends on blood-brain barrier breakdown. Thallium-201 (201Tl) appears to incorporate into viable tumor cells more rapidly than into normal brain cells. This report describes a new method to quantify the uptake of 201T1 in the tumor: the tumor-to-cardiac uptake ratio (T/C). Twenty-three 201T1 brain scans were performed on eight patients to differentiate recurrent viable high-grade astrocytoma from posttherapy changes. Planar images of the head and heart were obtained in order to calculate the ratio of tumor counts to cardiac counts. This ratio represents a numerical estimation of 201T1 uptake in the brain tumor relative to cardiac counts and is expressed as the T/C index. The T/C index correlated well with the clinical course in all eight patients. In general, however, CT suggested more extensive regrowth of tumor than the actual clinical status suggested. In one patient's course of radiological monitoring, tumor recurrence was detected by means of 201T1 imaging four months prior to its appearance on CT. In conclusion, when performed serially, the T/C index can provide an accurate estimate of residual tumor burden or recurrence, and detect and quantify viable tumor during therapy.\r"

The ELISA showed no cross-reactivity with intestinal alkaline phosphatase except in very high concentrations, after samples had been heat-treated. Three patients with germinoma were studied for serum PLAP levels and in all the levels were elevated (3.78, 0.52, and 2.11 IU/liter). Two of the germinoma patients were studied for PLAP levels in the CSF, and both had elevated levels (0.83 and 9.83 IU/liter). The intratumoral cyst fluid in one case of germinoma was tested for PLAP and the level was found to be very high (603 IU/liter). These PLAP levels decreased concomitantly with the reduction in tumor size during irradiation. Serum PLAP levels were measured in 40 control adult male individuals and in the CSF of 20 nonpregnant patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The upper normal limits were 0.20 and 0.11 IU/liter in the serum and the CSF, respectively. All PLAP levels measured in the serum of patients with various brain tumors were 0.18 IU/liter or less. This study strongly suggests that PLAP is a clinically useful tumor marker for primary intracranial germinoma.\r"

One SAC placement was associated with an intracerebral hematoma. There were no infections. For the 31 patients with SAC's and IVC's, there were 2706 pairs of ICP measurements with a mean difference of -0.12 torr and a standard deviation of 5.29 torr. The waveforms from the SAC's and IVC's were indistinguishable. For the nine patients with SAC's and SAB's, there were 773 pairs of ICP measurements with a mean difference of 1.24 torr and a standard deviation of 32.83 torr. The SAB waveforms were of varying quality and all dampened with time. The paired t-test (ts) demonstrated no statistically significant difference between SAC's and IVC's (ts = - 1.19). An analysis of variance demonstrated the scatter of the measurements obtained from SAB's to be 38.5 times that of SAC's, p less than 0.00005. The SAB is shown to be relatively inaccurate with a wide range of variance, while the SAC is demonstrated to be an accurate, reliable, and safe method of continuous ICP measurement and an acceptable alternative to ventriculostomy.\r"

Brain-stem auditory evoked responses (BAER's) were found to be pathological in different small series of patients with a postconcussion syndrome who were examined months after sustaining a slight cranial or cervical trauma; abnormal BAER's have also been reported in larger groups of patients examined early after minor head injury. A relationship between these findings and late subjective symptoms has never been demonstrated. The results of a prospective study into the value of BAER's in the prognosis of a postconcussion syndrome after minor head injury are presented. In 103 patients with minor head injury, BAER's were recorded within 48 hours of the trauma. One year later, the patients were examined for headache, dizziness, depression, anxiety, subjective loss of memory and concentration, and irritability. Eighty percent claimed at least one symptom, most often irritability (54%), memory loss (47%), or depression (39%). Pathological BAER's were found with the same prevalence in patients with and without a postconcussion syndrome. This study confirms the disturbance of brain-stem function in some head-injured patients. However, the lack of correlation with a postconcussion syndrome limits the prognostic value of BAER recordings for postconcussion syndrome. The data suggest that BAER's not be used for medicolegal evaluation of patients with a postconcussion syndrome.\r"

The myelographic appearance of the abnormal vessels may resemble that of the dilated veins or redundant nerve roots sometimes seen adjacent to regions of spinal block, obscuring the diagnosis. Two patients are described who presented with clinical histories and myelographic findings that led to laminectomies for presumed spinal stenosis; ultimately, both were found to have an AVM. Treatment of the AVM arrested the neurological decline in one patient, and resulted in dramatic improvement in the other. A hypothesis related to hemodynamic consequences of venous hypertension is presented in an attempt to link the pathophysiology of the two conditions.\r"

The average daily gain (ADG) and gain-feed (G-F) ratio of pigs fed the diet containing 100% milk protein were greater than those of pigs fed the diets containing either soybean meal or ROS. In experiment 2, heated nonfermented whole soybeans (HUS) or heated whole soybeans fermented with either AOS or ROS replaced 50% of the milk protein in isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets. Proximate and amino acid analyses of HUS and the fermented soybean products, AOS and ROS were similar. Pigs fed a diet containing either HUS or AOS had greater (P less than 0.05) mean ADG and G-F ratios than pigs fed the diet containing ROS. Apparent biological value, apparent net protein utilization and digestible and metabolizable energy utilization were similar for all dietary treatments. In conclusion, the protein and energy values of whole soybeans were not improved by fermentation with ROS or AOS compared to nonfermented heated whole soybeans, soybean meal or dried skim milk in diets fed to neonatal pigs.\r"

Animals fed 0.5 and 0.8 g tryptophan/kg grew more slowly, consumed less feed and had a lower efficiency of feed utilization than animals fed higher concentrations of tryptophan. Thirty similar animals were used in a second experiment. Diets containing 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 g tryptophan/kg diet (n = 6) were fed for 14 d, after which all animals were killed and samples were taken of longissimus dorsi, triceps brachii and biceps femoris. Protein synthetic activity was determined by monitoring the incorporation of [14C]phenylalanine into protein in vitro. There was no significant difference in synthetic activity between different muscle types. There was no effect of diet on the activity of the muscle soluble protein fraction. The activity of the muscle ribosomal fraction, however, was positively correlated with increasing concentrations of dietary tryptophan. It was concluded that tryptophan has the potential to regulate muscle protein synthesis in a manner beyond serving simply as a component of protein.\r"

Increasing the dietary leucine content of 2.3 to 10.6 or 12.6% DM led to a significant decrease in food intake. This depressing effect was not influenced by dietary protein content. Increasing the dietary leucine content from 2.3 to 6.4% DM in an adequate protein diet for a week did not significantly improve nitrogen retention in the preruminant lamb. Plasma leucine and its alpha-keto acid concentrations increased with leucine intake. Plasma valine and isoleucine concentrations were significantly decreased only in lambs fed the highest excess leucine diet. Surprisingly, a maximal 50% decrease of their plasma alpha-keto acid concentrations occurred even in the group fed the lowest excess leucine diet. Our results might be explained by an inhibition of the rate of transamination of valine and isoleucine by high leucine concentration.\r"

Hepatic cysteine dioxygenase activity, hepatic concentration of glutathione, cysteine and taurine and urinary taurine were examined. In addition, the sulfur amino acid metabolism of rats fed these diets fortified with the appropriate first limiting amino acid for 7 d was also examined. High urinary taurine excretion was observed in the three gluten groups, whereas very low urinary taurine excretion was observed with up to 24% soy protein or up to 16% casein. The hepatic hepatic cysteine dioxygenase activities of the gluten diet groups were higher than those of corresponding soy protein or casein diet groups, except that of rats fed the 24% casein diet. The hepatic concentrations of both glutathione and cysteine in gluten diet groups were also higher than those of corresponding soy protein or casein diet groups, except 24% soy protein and 16 and 24% casein diet groups. In rats fed the casein or soy protein diets urinary taurine excretion and hepatic cysteine dioxygenase activity increased with increasing methionine supplementation, the first limiting amino acid. Conversely, in rats fed the gluten diet both urinary taurine excretion and hepatic cysteine dioxygenase activity decreased with increasing lysine supplementation, the first limiting amino acid. These findings suggest that urinary taurine excretion and hepatic cysteine dioxygenase activity may be useful as sensitive indicators of the nutritional value of dietary protein.\r"

Feeding of xantham gum for 1 or 2 d decreased the rise in two enzyme activities and in total liver lipids, but after 4 or 7 d only total liver lipids were affected. Agar, which is insoluble at room temperature, was effective only when incorporated in the diet as a stiff gel. Guar, carrageenan, karaya and pectin reduced the change in at least one hepatic parameter, but acacia and gum ghatti, which impart little viscosity to water, were without effect. The ability of seven gums to form semisolid gels at low concentrations was measured and appeared to be associated with the variable effectiveness of those gums in influencing lipid contents and enzyme activities of the liver.\r"

The digestibility of phytase-deactivated wheat bran was studied on eight occasions and untreated wheat bran on two occasions in healthy ileostomates. Five subjects were studied for two 4-d periods and one subject on two occasions for two 4-d periods while fed a constant low fiber diet. The low fiber diet was supplemented with 16 g/d wheat bran in the second period. Three other subjects fed a low fiber diet were studied for 10 consecutive days, bran being added to the diet on d 5, 6 and 7. Inositol hexaphosphate and its degradation products were analyzed with a recently developed HPLC method. On average, 95% of the ingested phytate from phytase-deactivated wheat bran and 40% of the ingested phytate from untreated wheat bran were recovered in ileostomy contents. These results differ from those of a previous analysis using an iron precipitation method. Mucosal phytase and alakaline phosphatase, if present in the human small intestine, do not seem to play a significant role in phytate digestion in humans, whereas the dietary phytase may be an important factor for phytate hydrolysis. Iron precipitation methods are not adequate for determinations of phytate digestion.\r"

The present study identified the response of rat serum SOD activity contents to marginal and deficient copper intakes and to inflammation. Rats fed copper-deficient diet (less than 0.2 mg/kg Cu) for 5 wk displayed serum SOD activity contents that were only about 20% of those found in rats fed copper-supplemented diet (6.0 mg/kg Cu). Activities in rats fed a marginal diet (1.5 mg/kg Cu) were about 55% of those in the adequate rats. Turpentine-induced inflammation lowered serum SOD in rats within each dietary group. However, the change in the marginal group was not statistically significant. Based on chromatographic characterizations and inhibitor studies, rat serum SOD activity seemed to result primarily from a copper protein other than ceruloplasmin, Cu-Zn SOD or the recently discovered tissue extracellular SOD. In conclusion, low copper intake and inflammation may compromise extracellular defenses against superoxide. In addition, serum SOD activities could provide a non-ceruloplasmin-related means of assessing copper status, but nondietary variables can also affect these SOD values.\r"

Group NC rats exhibited typical copper deficiency signs such as decreased body weight, hematocrit and liver copper levels but increased heart/body weight ratios. Adipose and cardiac triglycerides of group NC rats had greater 18:0 to 18:1n-9 ratios. All tissues in group NC rats had higher levels of longer-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in triglycerides than those in AC or PF rats. Specifically, the following triglyceride fatty acids were in greater concentration in NC rats than in AC or PF rats: for liver, 18:2n-6, 22:5n-6, 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3; for cardiac, 20:3n-6, 20:4n-6 and 22:5n-6. Liver phospholipids had lower levels of 20:4n-6 in NC rats than in AC or PF rats.

Antibody titers after primary immunization with sheep erythrocytes were significantly lower in rats fed copper-deficient diets. Compared to starch, fructose markedly attenuated antibody production in copper-deficient rats. Dietary carbohydrate did not affect the humoral immune response of rats fed diets with adequate copper. Concentrations of copper in thymus, spleen, liver and heart were also significantly lower in rats fed fructose with deficient copper (F-Cu) than in the group fed starch with deficient copper. Thymic hypogenesis was observed only in the F-Cu group. Tissue concentrations of copper were reduced before antibody production was impaired. Repletion of previously copper-deficient rats rapidly restored immunocompetence and stimulated thymic growth. Immunoresponsiveness and tissue concentrations of copper reached control levels in rats fed diets containing starch and fructose at 1.2-1.6 and 2.2-2.9 mg Cu/kg diet, respectively. The results demonstrate that the amount of dietary copper required for optimal function of the humoral immune system, thymic growth and maintenance of normal tissue levels of this essential micronutrient is greater when young rats are fed diets with fructose than with starch.\r"

  ".W": "Intestinal 65Zn transport and metallothionein levels were examined in rats fed zinc-adequate and zinc-deficient diets and in rats subjected to an overnight fast. 65Zn uptake by intestines perfused with 1.5 microM 65Zn was greater in both zinc-deficient and fasted groups than in the control group. Mucosal retention of 65Zn was also greater in the zinc-deficient group but not in the fasted group. The greater 65Zn uptake in the fasted group was associated with a compartment that readily released 65Zn back into the lumen. Kinetic analysis of the rate of 65Zn transfer to the vascular space (absorption) showed that 65Zn absorption involved approximately 3% of mucosal 65Zn in a 40-min perfusion period. The half-life (t1/2) of this mucosal 65Zn rapid transport pool corresponded directly to changes in intestinal metallothionein levels. Both metallothionein and t1/2 were higher in the fasted group and lower in the zinc-deficient group than in controls. While the rate of 65Zn transport from this rapid transport pool decreased with increasing metallothionein level, the predicted pool size increased when the metallothionein level was elevated by fasting. These results indicate that the rate of zinc absorption is inversely related to intestinal metallothionein levels, but the portion of mucosal 65Zn available for absorption is directly related to intestinal metallothionein.\r"

Preferential use of substrates for lipid synthesis results in inefficient use of dietary nitrogen for protein deposition. Three studies were carried out to determine whether an increased protein requirement caused hyperphagia and whether young Zucker rats preferentially regulated protein or energy intake. Rats were offered isoenergetic diets with nitrogen contents ranging from 4.5 to 53.2 mg/g, or isonitrogenous diets with energy contents of 2.2, 3.3 or 4.2 kcal/g. In both situations obese rats had significantly higher food intakes than lean rats. Within phenotype the rats maintained an almost constant energy intake so that nitrogen intake was proportional to dietary nitrogen concentration. In a third experiment lean and obese rats were given different proportions of their control protein intake by stomach tube. Energy intake was determined by voluntary consumption of a protein-free diet. Within phenotype energy intake was the same for all levels of protein intake. It appears that obese Zucker rats regulate energy intake at an elevated level and that protein intake is determined by dietary nitrogen content. Hyperphagia does not appear to result from a desire to obtain protein.\r"

Thirty-six per cent of 972 patients developed fever (temperature exceeding 38 degrees C). Their 13% mortality rate and 13.2-day average hospital stay exceeded the 3% mortality and seven-day hospitalization for afebrile patients (p less than 0.0001 for both). Most fever episodes occurred during the first two hospital days. Approximately 30% of first and subsequent fever episodes were caused by bacterial infections; illnesses involving tissue necrosis (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction) accounted for 20%. Five conditions comprised 53% of diagnoses: respiratory and urinary tract infections, neoplasm, myocardial infarction, and drug reaction. Only one patient had a fever of uncertain origin. Several clinical clues used frequently to identify bacterial infections were reevaluated. Patients with bacterial infections had higher temperatures on the first febrile day (mean 38.9 degrees C) and were more likely to have had prior infections than those with other causes of fever (mean 38.3 degrees C, p less than 0.001). Older patients (greater than 75 years) had a lower febrile response to bacterial infections than younger patients. Fever in hospitalized medical patients is a common and important concomitant of increased mortality and length of hospitalization.\r"

Identical criteria yielded comparable groups (cases = 109, controls = 211) receiving primary care at this tertiary center. Radiology and medical records were examined for mammograms; these were blindly categorized \"diagnostic,\" \"screening,\" or \"indeterminant.\" The major, unexpected finding was that less than 6% of controls had ever had screening mammography. The associations between screening and metastatic cancer (odds ratios) suggest a beneficial effect of screening: OR/0.73 for ever screened and OR/0.71 if screened within the year of cancer diagnosis. All confidence intervals include one; however, low screening participation leaves this study with little power. The major implication is that despite the current recommendations, the elderly are not being included in screening mammography programs.\r"

Also, there was a significant increase in the development of secondary malignancies (observed, 53; expected, 31, p less than 0.01). However, there was no significant increase in secondary malignancies if only those malignancies occurring at least six months after the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was made were analyzed (observed, 38; expected, 29, p = 0.26). This suggests that the increase in secondary malignancies is not treatment-related, and may be due to the underlying disease.\r"

Three hundred and four patients awaiting appointments at a university hospital's ambulatory medical clinic were randomized to view one of five videotapes (VTs) of a patient seeking advice about antimicrobial prophylaxis for a heart murmur. In VT-1 and VT-2, the physician disclosed no uncertainty and prescribed therapy. In VT-3, VT-4, and VT-5, the physician openly conveyed uncertainty but then: (VT-3) prescribed antibiotics without resolving his uncertainty; (VT-4) consulted a reference book with the patient present, then prescribed; or (VT-5) checked a computer with the patient present, then prescribed. Patients rated their satisfaction with the physician on a standardized questionnaire. Differences in satisfaction between the five VTs were significant (p = 0.001), with the highest ratings found for VT-1 and VT-2, where no uncertainty was disclosed. The lowest ratings in satisfaction were found when the physician expressed but then ignored uncertainty (VT-3) or examined a textbook (VT-4). Global satisfaction was inversely and significantly correlated (r = -0.47) with the patients' perception of uncertainty in the physician. The manner in which clinical uncertainty is disclosed to patients and then resolved by the physician appears to affect patients' satisfaction.\r"

Unvaccinated surgical residents were also concerned about side effects (64%). Stepwise discriminant function analysis revealed that medical residents were vaccinated if they were concerned about risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus and the chronic complications of infection and if they had received hepatitis B immune globulin and influenza vaccine. Surgical residents were vaccinated if they believed hepatitis B vaccine was efficacious, but were not vaccinated if they believed hepatitis B virus infection was not serious.\r"

Little is known, however, about whether a successful intervention aimed at improving performance applied in one setting will carry over to another. To explore this issue, the authors examined the impact of an intervention involving lecture, feedback, and checklists introduced during an ambulatory care rotation at one hospital (SPR) on resident performance of six preventive care measures at a second outpatient clinic (VA). The performance of 15 residents who had been exposed to the program was compared with that of 13 who had not been exposed to the program. The mean proportion of indicated measures performed by the exposed residents was significantly higher than that of the residents without exposure to the program (0.49 vs. 0.36, p less than 0.05). Improvement was found for all measures but was statistically significant only for influenza vaccination (0.28 vs. 0.07, p = 0.03). Post-intervention performance at SPR was also significantly improved (0.53 vs. 0.36, p less than 0.001). The authors conclude not only that the intervention improved resident performance of preventive care but also that the improvement was carried over to practice in a second outpatient setting.\r"

Many students (32%) had greater than or equal to 2 sexual partners in the past year, but only 23% of these had changed their sexual practices because of concern about AIDS. Some students with high-risk sexual behavior were not very knowledgeable: among homosexual or bisexual men, those with greater than or equal to 6 recent sexual partners knew less than others (P less than 0.001). Overall, less knowledgeable students had more personal concerns about AIDS, favored limiting the social activities of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and favored screening for HIV-antibody; these associations between knowledge and attitudes were significant even when controlling for demographic characteristics and sexual behavior with multiple linear regression. The authors conclude that many students receiving primary care reported sexual behavior that could spread HIV, and that less knowledgeable students had particular concerns and attitudes about AIDS.\r"

The decline of interest in primary care specialties occurred mainly in general internal medicine. Changes in career activity since 1981 reflected increasing interest by the students in full-time academic appointments and decreasing interest in solo, private practices. Changes in the size of a city in which students planned to practice reflected an increasing interest in large cities or suburbs. The students' preferences for certain geographic regions of the country for practice locations changed very little. Finally, total postsecondary educational debt increased from an average of +19,697 in 1981 to an average of +33,499 in 1986. This difference represents a 70 percent increase as measured by 1987 dollars and a 37 percent increase in constant dollars.\r"

The author considered that members of the 1982 class were less likely than those in the 1986 class to have been influenced by perceptions of increased competition for residency positions. The students in the class of 1986 were found to have deferred third-year clerkships into the fourth year more often than the class of 1982. The class of 1986 selected more courses related to their intended specialty than did the class of 1982, particularly for those intending to pursue residencies in orthopedics. Also, the class of 1986 spent a greater proportion of their fourth year in electives at hospitals where they intended to apply for residencies. These data support the contention that medical students' perception that residency positions were more difficult to obtain led to changes in selecting courses in the fourth-year of medical school.\r"

The students' assessments of geriatric content were found to be not valid. Considerable variability was found in the amount of geriatric content within courses, and review of course examinations was found to be the most valid review method. Pharmacology and second-year psychiatry courses were shown to have the most coverage of geriatrics, while microbiology, biochemistry, and neuroanatomy courses were shown to have the least coverage of geriatric items. The geriatric items in the course examinations correlated strongly (r = .71) with the National Board of Medical Examiners Part I and Part II examinations; because of this correlation, the investigators felt the study findings may be generalizable outside the one medical school. It would appear that geriatric content within the medical school curriculum is low; however, the results of the review methods indicate that disagreement exists over the degree of deficiency. The authors conclude that examination review offers an expeditious method to determine the relative emphasis placed upon geriatrics material within specific courses.\r"

To assess whether residents who received a packet of printed material on these four health-related practices and had a 5- to 15-minute review of the material with a physician and an educator would increase their promotion of these healthful behaviors, a controlled trial was conducted at the University of Missouri--Columbia Hospitals and Clinics. When baseline differences in the behavior between the intervention and control groups of residents were controlled statistically, there was no significant difference in the amount of health promotion done by the two groups after the educational intervention. An educational intervention may not be an effective way to increase residents' promotion of healthful activities. These results raise questions about the methods used in some previously published studies that suggested favorable effects of education on physicians' behavior.\r"

  ".W": "In 1982 the Division of Community Pediatrics of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill began a new training program for all first-year pediatrics residents and fourth-year medical students taking an ambulatory pediatrics elective. The program was designed to introduce the trainees to community resources for children and increase their knowledge of the factors affecting children's development. During their regular hospital clinic rotations, the trainees spend approximately one-third of their time in program activities that involve 25 community agencies. Educational packets (consisting of books, journal articles, films, slides, videotapes, self-instruction materials, manuals for developmental tests, and/or agency materials) are provided for each program component. At the end of each one-month rotation of program activities, the trainees meet individually with the program director and coordinator to discuss the trainee's experiences and reactions and to identify strengths and weaknesses of the program components.\r"
