  ".W": "Endothelial cell seeding is the transplantation of vascular endothelial cells to denuded vascular surfaces. Seeding theoretically reduces the probability of graft or vessel thrombosis and of neointimal fibrous hyperplasia. Thus far, clinical seeding trials disclosed modest improvements in patency and the development of hyperplastic anastomotic lesions in failed grafts. Seeding inefficiency theoretically contributes to anastomotic hyperplasia. The inefficiency is linked to two steps in the seeding process, namely harvesting and cell retention. Of these, cell retention on the seeded surface is the more critical. Priorities for future research should be set first on the retention of seeded endothelium in vitro and second on improved and standardized methods of cell harvesting.\r"

Further studies will be necessary to provide further insight into the healing and long-term behavior of these grafts, both with respect to the thrombogenicity of the surface as well as the influence on anastomotic hyperplasia.\r"

Eleven of sixty-five brains in the Medical Research Council Central AIDS Brain Bank were selected for study. The selected patients died without opportunistic infection or neoplasm affecting the brain; they had HIV encephalitis or minimal changes. We compared their neuronal counts with those of eight control subjects (seven died of systemic illness, one of pontine haemorrhage which did not affect the cerebral hemispheres). The neuronal numerical density was significantly lower in the HIV group than in the control group (mean [SD] 307 [46] vs 499 [113] x 10(2) per mm3; p less than 0.001). This difference represents a loss of about 38%. There was no significant difference between the HIV subgroups, which suggests that neuronal loss occurs in cases of minor pathology as well as in HIV encephalitis. This finding contributes to the understanding of dementia in AIDS patients and has important implications for their future treatment.\r"

Drug or placebo was given at 2200 h, 5 h before the mean time of sleep onset determined by pretrial sleep logs. In all 8 subjects sleep onset time (mean advance 82 [range 19-124] min; p less than 0.01) and wake time (117 [10-187] min; p less than 0.01) were significantly earlier during melatonin treatment than during placebo. Mean total sleep time was slightly less on melatonin (8 h 12 min) than on placebo (8 h 46 min). Alertness acrophase calculated from the subjects' ratings of alertness made every 2 h while awake was unaltered.

The cumulative prevalence of new gallstones within 3 years of major surgery was 28%; no new gallstones were seen from 36 to up to 140 months postoperatively. By univariate and logistic regression analysis, age and major abdominal surgery were the only significant clinical determinants for the appearance of gallstones during follow-up. The findings of this retrospective study indicate that major abdominal surgery may accelerate the development of gallstones in some patients. If confirmed in a prospective study, it may be possible to define groups at high risk of gallstones after surgery and to institute prophylactic measures.\r"

To avoid recall bias and to allow measurement of important biological factors a prospective cohort study of the cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is being conducted. The infants included are those at high risk of the syndrome as assessed by a perinatal score. Of the 3110 members of the cohort born between January, 1988, and end of March, 1990, 23 infants later died of SIDS. Sleep position information was available for 15 of these. Matched analysis to control for the confounding effects of infant birthweight and maternal age indicated that prone sleeping position was associated with an increased risk of SIDS (OR 4.47 95% Cl [1.30-15.43]). The findings are strengthened by the results of a concurrent retrospective case-control study of 42 SIDS cases in which the prone position was also associated with an increased risk of SIDS (unadjusted OR 3.45 [1.59-7.49]).\r"

  ".W": "Subtle impairments of cognitive function may be an important cause of occupational and psychosocial morbidity in patients with chronic liver disease. Correlation of structural brain abnormalities with cognitive deficits has yielded inconsistent results. 10 patients with cirrhotic liver disease were compared with 10 age, education, and intelligence matched control subjects. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant overall cognitive impairments in cirrhotic patients compared with controls (p = 0.02). Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPET or SPECT) and showed increased uptake of radiotracer in the right and left posterior parts of the basal ganglia and right occipital lobe, together with reduced uptake in the right anterior cingulate region. The degree of cognitive impairment was directly correlated with functional abnormalities in the basal ganglia and limbic cortex (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that impaired cognitive status may be associated with abnormalities of regional brain function in patients with chronic liver disease. Since these deficits are clinically inapparent, our findings have important implications for identification and management of patients with chronic liver disease.\r"

Autonomic tests indicated selective impairment of adrenergic sympathetic function. Plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, and dopamine beta hydroxylase were undetectable. Skin biopsy specimens showed loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y (markers of adrenergic sympathetic fibres) and of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (sensory neuropeptides). A sural nerve biopsy specimen showed severe depletion of unmyelinated fibres. The constellation of losses were compatible with nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation, which was confirmed on assay. This new syndrome may be explained by loss of trophic action of NGF.\r"

We examined the records of 249 such women treated between 1975 and 1985, and compared overall and recurrence-free survival in those whose operation was 3-12 days after their last menstrual period (LMP) (group 1, n = 75) with those in whom it was 0-2 or 13-32 days after LMP (group 2, n = 174). Overall and recurrence-free survival were greatly reduced in group 1 women (p less than 0.001 for both). Actuarial survival at 10 years was 54% in group 1 versus 84% in group 2. This effect was independent of other factors, was of much the same importance as nodal status in multivariate analysis, was largely confined to histologically node-positive cases, seemed to be greater in women with small tumours (less than or equal to 2 cm), and was seen in patients with oestrogen-receptor positive and negative tumours. Thus phase of menstrual cycle at operation is of great importance for long-term outlook in premenopausal women with breast cancer.\r"

The available manpower and resources can only provide services for less than 10% of the new blind cataract patients each year, and little is being done for the estimated 3 million \"cataract backlog\". A serious limiting factor to the development of prevention of blindness programmes is lack of trained manpower. Despite an increase in the number of ophthalmologists trained in cataract surgery (which varies greatly from country to country), this number is not keeping pace with increased demand for eye-care services, especially in large rural populations. Initiatives that will help to overcome this dilemma are specific post-graduate courses in community ophthalmology in Africa, plans to develop a one-year diploma in ophthalmology course for English-speaking West African countries, and a proposal to upgrade a similar course in Zimbabwe. Additionally there is a need for the training of more ophthalmic assistants, cataract surgeons, and nurses in the diagnosis and management of common ophthalmic disorders. Experienced expatriate ophthalmologists also have an important role in the teaching of doctors and ophthalmic assistants how to select patients and carry out successful inexpensive cataract surgery with appropriate technology and limited facilities.\r"

Therefore, the electromyographer must choose his technique and optimal parameters depending on the situation, type of condition, whether the purpose is diagnosis or monitoring, and so on. In this presentation the relationship between EMG parameters and physiologic and morphologic counterparts in some pathologic conditions will be discussed.\r"

Fibers in a fascicle were divided into layers according to their relation to the perimysium. In each layer the proportions of type 1 and 2, subdivided into 2a, 2b, and 2c fibers were determined and normalized by the fiber type proportion in the whole fascicle. A consistent arrangement of fiber types within the fascicles was obtained, regardless of subject, sampling site, fiber type proportion, and fascicle size. A high proportion of 2b fibers on the border, a prevalence of type 1 fibers in the layer beneath, and a rather uniform distribution of 2a fibers in all layers are the main characteristics of the distribution of fibers in a fascicle. Developmental processes in fiber type differentiation most probably constitute the basis for fiber type arrangement, which can further be influenced by local factors.\r"

Fibrillation potentials are commonly seen and tend to reflect active disease, diminishing after successful medical management or disease regression. Other muscle diseases can present with similar electromyographic abnormalities, thereby necessitating muscle biopsy for definitive diagnosis.\r"

Strips of jaw muscle were permitted to regenerate bilaterally in the beds of a fast limb muscle with innervation on one side being prevented surgically. Immunocytochemical analyses using anti-myosin heavy chain antibodies were done at various times postoperatively, the latest being after 78 days. We found little difference between innervated and uninnervated regenerates up to 27 days postoperatively. All regenerating myotubes expressed fetal myosin. In addition, some myotubes stained for superfast or slow myosin, while others stained for both superfast and slow myosins. Subsequently, uninnervated myotubes became atrophic but continued to express fetal, slow, and superfast myosins while innervated myofibers suppressed fetal and slow myosin expression. These results are consistent with the notion that satellite cells of jaw-closing muscles are committed to express superfast myosin during myogenesis, and that the expression of this program is independent of innervation.\r"

The MR was abnormal in 20 of 23 cases with bilateral INO and in 21 of 28 with unilateral INO. The R1 component of the BL (BL-R1) was abnormal in 7 of 23 patients with bilateral INO and 10 of 28 with unilateral INO. Combined MR and BL-R1 changes occurred in 8 of 28 cases with unilateral INO and 7 of 23 with bilateral INO. The findings provide evidence for a rostral/caudal localization of lesions within the medial longitudinal fasciculus causing INO on the basis of MR and BL-R1 abnormalities. An abnormality limited to MR suggests a midbrain location in 58.8% of patients while abnormal BL-R1 with or without an associated MR change suggests a rostral pontine location in 35.3%.\r"

We propose that CAD may be associated with a reversible sensory-autonomic neuropathy in the absence of cryoglobulinemia.

We report a case of LHM involving the proximal ulnar nerve in a 13-year-old boy. Serial clinical and electrophysiological observations were done, including intraoperative recordings directly from the nerve on two occasions. The evolution of abnormalities, as documented by electrophysiological and immunohistochemical studies, is compatible with a process of progressive thinning of myelin sheaths, culminating in axonal degeneration in later stages. Intraoperative recording of nerve action potentials was used to guide surgical management of the lesion. Ultimately, there was a good clinical and electrophysiological response to resection of the lesion and sural nerve fascicular grafting.\r"

  ".W": "The localizations of myoglobin in skeletal muscle cells of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), myotonic dystrophy (MyD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. In normal skeletal muscle cells, myoglobin was localized mainly in the I-band region. In degenerating muscle cells of patients with DMD and MyD, myoglobin was also demonstrated in the distended lumen of the internal membrane system and in the intermyofibrillar space, through which it seemed to pass into the extracellular space. No myoglobin was detected in opaque fibers or in some of small-sized fibers in DMD muscle. In patients with ALS the staining intensities of myoglobin varied in different muscle cells, but myoglobin was restricted to the I-band region in many muscle cells. These findings suggest that changes in the localization of myoglobin in skeletal muscle cell sensitively reflect the pathologic status of muscle cells.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine how the new myotendinous junctions were re-established at the proximal and distal ends of the soleus muscle after tenotomy. Both proximal and distal tendons of the soleus muscle in mature female rats were severed. The animals were killed and the soleus muscles were removed and prepared for light and electron microscopic examination 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days after the operation. It was found that segmental fiber destruction followed by removal by macrophages occurred at the ends of the soleus muscle fibers. This resulted in the liberation and myogenic activation of satellite cells. By 3 days after tenotomy the fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes could be seen. The myotubes developed within the original basal lamina and reattached to the surviving non-necrotic segments and grew in both length and width so that by 6 weeks postoperation, normal myotendinous junctions had been reformed. This study is the first to show that re-establishment of the myotendinous junction following tenotomy is accomplished by regeneration of the necrotic ends of the tenotomized fibers.\r"

  ".W": "Relevant muscle- and species-specific differences may be found in the reaction of muscles to hindlimb suspension. This problem has been studied in 5 rabbits following a one-week hindlimb suspension, and in 5 ground-based controls. The soleus and the tibialis were prepared for light and transmission electron microscopy. In suspension the animals occasionally extended and flexed the hindlimbs, but, when standing still, their hindfeet were plantar-flexed to an angle of 180 degrees. In this position the length of the soleus was determined to be 35% less than in controls, whereas that of the tibialis was 30% more. Histologically, the tibialis fibers usually exhibited a preserved sarcomeric pattern, whereas soleus fibers displayed a regular sequence of areas of shortened sarcomeres, alternating with areas of myofibrillar disruption. These findings demonstrated that hindlimb suspension induces a focal breakdown of the soleus myofibrils, probably dependent on the reduced longitudinal tension of the suspended soleus and its phasic contractions against no load. It is conceivable that similar factors could also be responsible for soleus muscle atrophy induced by hypogravity as well as by other clinical conditions during which a stressful plantar flexion of the feet occurs against no load.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In experimental models of meningitis and in children with meningitis, dexamethasone has been shown to reduce meningeal inflammation and to improve the outcome of disease. METHODS. We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of dexamethasone therapy in 101 infants and children admitted to the National Children's Hospital, San Jose, Costa Rica, who had culture-proved bacterial meningitis or clinical signs of meningitis and findings characteristic of bacterial infection on examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone and cefotaxime (n = 52) or cefotaxime plus placebo (n = 49). Dexamethasone (0.15 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given 15 to 20 minutes before the first dose of cefotaxime and was continued every 6 hours thereafter for four days. RESULTS. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory profiles were similar for the patients in the two treatment groups. By 12 hours after the beginning of therapy, the mean opening cerebrospinal pressure and the estimated cerebral perfusion pressure had improved significantly in the dexamethasone-treated children but worsened in the children treated only with cefotaxime (controls). At 12 hours meningeal inflammation and the concentrations of two cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha and platelet-activating factor) in the cerebrospinal fluid had decreased in the dexamethasone-treated children, whereas in the controls the inflammatory response in the cerebrospinal fluid had increased. At 24 hours the clinical condition and mean prognostic score were significantly better among those treated with dexamethasone than among the controls. At follow-up examination after a mean of 15 months, 7 of the surviving 51 dexamethasone-treated children (14 percent) and 18 of 48 surviving controls (38 percent) had one or more neurologic or audiologic sequelae (P = 0.007); the relative risk of sequelae for a child receiving placebo as compared with a child receiving dexamethasone was 3.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 11.5). CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study, in which dexamethasone administration began before the initiation of cefotaxime therapy, provide additional evidence of a beneficial effect of dexamethasone therapy in infants and children with bacterial meningitis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The value of beta-adrenergic-antagonist drug therapy for the prevention of initial episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices is uncertain, both positive and negative study results having been reported. METHODS. In this study, we analyzed data on individual patients from four randomized, controlled trials to assess the efficacy of this treatment. Of the 589 patients studied, 286 received a beta-adrenergic-antagonist drug (propranolol in 203 and nadolol in 83) and 303 received placebo. RESULTS. After two years, the mean (+/- SE) percentage of patients who had had no upper gastrointestinal bleeding was 78 +/- 3 percent in the beta-adrenergic-antagonist treatment group and 65 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.002). The percentage of patients without fatal bleeding was 90 +/- 2 percent in the treatment group and 82 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.01). The percentage of patients surviving after two years was 71 +/- 3 percent in the treatment group and 68 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.34). After age and severity of cirrhosis were taken into account, the survival rate was better in the treatment group (P = 0.09). The percentage of surviving patients who had had no bleeding after two years was 62 +/- 3 percent in the treatment group and 53 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.04). Both propranolol and nadolol prevented a first episode of bleeding. Severe cirrhosis and especially the presence of ascites were associated with bleeding (P less than 0.001) and death (P less than 0.001) in both groups. The efficacy of beta-adrenergic-antagonist therapy in the prevention of bleeding (P less than 0.001) and of fatal bleeding (P = 0.004) and in the prevention of bleeding or death (P = 0.005) was the same after adjustment for cause and severity of cirrhosis, ascites, and size of varices. CONCLUSIONS. Propranolol and nadolol are effective in preventing first bleeding and reducing the mortality rate associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis, regardless of severity.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Endothelial cells release endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in a variety of vascular beds, including the pulmonary circulation. However, the role of EDRF-mediated pulmonary-artery relaxation in chronic hypoxic lung disease is unknown. METHODS. We studied endothelium-dependent relaxation mediated by EDRF in vitro in pulmonary arteries that had been obtained from 22 patients undergoing heart-lung transplantation for end-stage chronic obstructive lung disease. Control pulmonary arteries were obtained from 15 patients undergoing lobectomy for lung carcinoma who did not have evidence of other chronic lung disease. The responses of all vascular rings (external diameter, 1.2 to 3.4 mm) to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and adenosine diphosphate were studied immediately after lung excision. RESULTS. Pulmonary arterial rings from the patients with chronic lung disease developed a greater tension (2.19 +/- 0.16 g) in response to phenylephrine (10(-6) M) than the rings from control patients (1.28 +/- 0.18 g, P less than 0.05). Inhibition of EDRF synthesis by treatment with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (10(-4) M) eliminated this difference, increasing the tension in the rings from the controls (P less than 0.01) but not in those from the patients with chronic lung disease. Rings from control patients relaxed in response to cumulative doses (10(-10) to 10(-5) M) of acetylcholine (maximal relaxation, 81.3 +/- 3.9 percent) and adenosine diphosphate (maximal relaxation, 85.3 +/- 2.6 percent). By contrast, rings from patients with chronic obstructive lung disease achieved only 41.3 +/- 4.8 percent of maximal relaxation in response to acetylcholine (n = 32) and 49.4 +/- 5.5 percent in response to adenosine diphosphate (n = 24) (P less than 0.001, as compared with control rings). Rings from both the controls and the patients with chronic lung disease relaxed similarly in response to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (10(-4) M). There was an inverse correlation between the degree of intimal thickening and the level of maximal relaxation of the rings from the patients with chronic lung disease (r = -0.60, P less than 0.001). Maximal relaxation was also related directly to the partial pressure of arterial oxygen before transplantation (r = 0.68, P less than 0.01) and inversely to the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide before transplantation (r = -0.55, P less than 0.01), but not to the forced expiratory volume in one second (r = 0.19, P not significant). CONCLUSIONS. Endothelium-dependent pulmonary-artery relaxation in vitro is impaired in arteries from patients with end-stage chronic obstructive lung disease. Such impairment may contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension in chronic hypoxic lung disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In primary biliary cirrhosis the hepatic lesions may result, at least in part, from the intracellular accumulation of potentially toxic endogenous bile acids. Preliminary work suggests that the administration of ursodiol (also called ursodeoxycholic acid), a hydrophilic bile acid without hepatotoxicity, leads to improvement in the condition of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. METHODS. We conducted a two-year, multicenter, double-blind trial to compare the efficacy of ursodiol with that of placebo. Patients with biopsy-proved primary biliary cirrhosis were randomly assigned to receive either ursodiol (13 to 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) (n = 73) or placebo (n = 73). Treatment failure was defined as a doubling of bilirubin levels to more than 70 mumol per liter or the occurrence of a severe complication (ascites or variceal bleeding) or an adverse reaction. RESULTS. Treatment failed in 6 patients in the ursodiol group, as compared with 13 in the placebo group (P less than 0.01 by Cox regression model). A single patient in each group withdrew because of minor adverse effects. After two years of treatment, the proportion of patients with clinically overt disease decreased only in the ursodiol group (P less than 0.02). The patients treated with ursodiol had significant improvements in serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, cholesterol, and IgM (all P less than 0.001); the antimitochondrial-antibody titer (P less than 0.01); and the Mayo risk score (P less than 0.001). Follow-up analysis of 95 liver-biopsy specimens showed a significant improvement in the mean histologic score (P less than 0.002) and in all the characteristic histologic features except fibrosis only in the group given ursodiol. CONCLUSIONS. Ursodiol is a safe and effective treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis.\r"

The structures of these lipids are shown to be phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol-(3,4)bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)trisphosphate, and we present evidence that in intact neutrophils a phosphatidyl-inositol-(4,5)bisphosphate-3-kinase seems to be the focal point through which agonists stimulate the formation of 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids.\r"

It functions at a point before the control of sex determination and X-chromosome dosage compensation diverge. Here we report that sdc-1 encodes a protein of 1,203 amino acids containing seven zinc fingers. This protein motif in combination with other genetic and molecular information suggests that sdc-1 is likely to function as an embryonic transcription factor regulating downstream genes involved specifically in the sex determination and dosage compensation pathways, or regulating other genes involved in the coordinate control of both processes. These results enhance our general understanding of sex determination strategies, which are already known to involve transcriptional regulation and alternative RNA splicing in Drosophila melanogaster, DNA rearrangements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and transcriptional regulation in mammals.\r"

The phosphorylation might be catalysed by a so-far-unidentified tyrosine kinase, distinct from p60c-src. Recently we purified a protein-tyrosine kinase that specifically phosphorylates tyrosine 527 of p60c-src from neonatal rat brain. We have now confirmed the specificity of this enzyme by using a mutant p60c-src that has a phenylalanine instead of tyrosine 527, and cloned a complementary DNA that encodes the enzyme. The enzyme is similar to kinases of the src family in that it has two conserved regions, Src-homology regions 2 and 3, upstream of a tyrosine kinase domain. The amino-acid identity of each region is no more than 47%, however, and the enzyme lacks phosphorylation sites corresponding to tyrosines 416 and 527 of p60c-src and has no myristylation signal. These results suggest that this protein-tyrosine kinase, which might negatively regulate p60c-src, represents a new type of tyrosine kinase.\r"

Previously described in vitro assays of peptide binding to class I molecules have been limited by either the low proportion of accessible binding sites or the lack of allelic specificity. Here we describe a system in which the human class I molecule HLA-B27 binds considerable amounts of an influenza peptide with precise allelic discrimination. Binding requires viable cells, is stimulated by gamma-interferon and is inhibited by brefeldin A. Our results are consistent with the presence of fairly stable 'empty' HLA-B27 molecules at the cell surface. By contrast, analysis of the binding of a second influenza peptide indicates that empty HLA-Aw68 molecules are relatively short-lived. We speculate that HLA-B27 might bind extracellular peptides in vivo and that this property could underlie its association with autoimmune disease.\r"

  ".U": "91226542\r", 
  ".W": "Human herpesvirus type-6 (HHV-6) is a recently isolated herpesvirus which is highly prevalent in adult populations around the world. HHV-6 was first isolated from the peripheral blood of six individuals with lymphoproliferative disorders, two of whom were also infected with human immunodeficiency virus. HHV-6, in common with other herpesviruses, transactivates the HIV long terminal repeat linked to reporter genes and has in addition been shown to accelerate HIV gene expression and CD4 cell death in cultures co-infected with both viruses. The virus is tropic for CD4+ lymphocytes and persists in the peripheral blood of most seropositive individuals. We have now identified a gene in HHV-6 encoding a 490-amino-acid polypeptide homologous to the human adeno-associated virus type-2 (AAV-2) rep gene. This gene has an essential role in AAV-2 DNA replication, can trans-regulate homologous and heterologous gene expression, and inhibits cellular transformation. The acquisition of rep by HHV-6 could be due to natural transfer of genetic information between DNA viruses of eukaryotes and is likely to have important consequences for the life-cycle of HHV-6 and for the host CD4 cell.\r"

There were no factors predisposing to the development of response fluctuations or dementia. Younger age at disease onset predisposed to the development of dyskinesia. Dyskinesias occurred in a greater proportion of patients in whom the initiation of levodopa therapy was delayed by more than 2 years from disease diagnosis than among those in whom treatment was started earlier.

To investigate the possible development of acute tachyphylaxis, we evaluated the effects of repeated injections of intravenous levodopa in 10 PD patients with motor fluctuations by administering, during a single day, a previously determined optimal levodopa dose repeatedly each time motor function returned to baseline. Peak antiparkinsonian response was lower by 20%, and peak plasma levodopa levels lower by 35% following the first dose compared with all subsequent doses. Neither peak dyskinesia scores nor the duration of motor response changed significantly with successive levodopa doses. These data suggest that pulsatile levodopa administration does not acutely alter dopamine receptor responsiveness, and that other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors contribute to the dose-to-dose variability in response to levodopa.\r"

We found dementia, as defined by a global intellectual performance 2 standard deviations lower than mean control values, in 93% of SDAT, 66% of HD, 58% of PSP, and 18% of PD patients. Specific features of cognitive impairment distinguished the four groups of patients once they were matched for level of intellectual deterioration: remote memory and linguistic disorders in SDAT, frontal lobe-like abnormalities in PSP, concentration and acquisition disorders in HD. There was no specific alteration in demented PD patients. This study demonstrates the frequency of dementia in predominantly subcortical degenerative diseases and indicates that \"subcortical dementia,\" rather than being a homogeneous entity, should be divided into specific subtypes of cognitive impairment related to different underlying specific lesions of each disease.\r"

Ophthalmologic and neurologic investigations were negative, and follow-up of 2 to 15 years has been uneventful. Eye movement recordings showed the characteristics of the nystagmus to be indistinguishable from congenital nystagmus, which normally becomes manifest in early infancy.

  ".W": "We previously compared the diagnostic capabilities of MRI of the head with CT, evoked potentials, and CSF oligoclonal banding (OB) analysis in a prospective evaluation of 200 patients with suspected multiple sclerosis (MS). To examine the ability of MRI and other paraclinical tests to predict the diagnosis of clinically definite MS (CDMS), we did a systematic clinical follow-up of 200 patients who were previously reported. In that study, 85 of 200 could be diagnosed as having laboratory-supported definite MS (LSDMS). In follow-up, we excluded one patient diagnosed as LSDMS who in retrospect was considered to have had CDMS at entry and 15 patients who were eventually diagnosed as having other diseases. After a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, 55 of the remaining 184 patients (30%) had developed CDMS. Thirty-eight of 84 patients with an original diagnosis of LSDMS (45%) and 17 of the remaining 100 patients with suspected MS (17%) had become CDMS. Forty-six of the 55 patients who developed CDMS in follow-up (84%) had an initial MRI that was strongly suggestive of MS. Fifty-two of those 55 CDMS patients (95%) had at least one MS-like abnormality on MRI when originally studied. In contrast, 38 of 55 (69%) had CSF OB, 38 of 55 (69%) had an abnormal VEP, 35 of 55 (64%) had an abnormal SEP, and 21 of 55 (38%) had an abnormal CT when first studied. MRI was the most sensitive single paraclinical test for predicting CDMS.

  ".W": "The mechanism by which prednisone improves muscle strength and function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is unknown. We addressed the possibility that clinical improvement was related to prednisone-induced alterations in skeletal muscle dystrophin. We performed muscle biopsies on patients at the conclusion of a randomized, double-blind, 6-month trial of prednisone and analyzed dystrophin content using Western blots and antibody staining of tissue sections. These studies demonstrated no significant differences in dystrophin content between treatment (prednisone 1.5 mg/kg/d, n = 12; prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d, n = 9) and placebo (n = 12) groups. Of interest, however, was the presence of varying numbers of dystrophin-positive fibers (revertants) occurring individually or in clusters in antibody-stained tissue sections of more than one-half of the Duchenne patients. Mutation analysis revealed that revertants occurred in DMD patients with identifiable deletions half of the Duchenne patients. Mutation analysis revealed that revertants occurred in DMD patients with identifiable deletions or duplications, and in nondeletion patients. Prednisone treatment did not influence the prevalence of revertants. Revertants are most likely due to a second-site mutation occurring in a somatic cell allowing for restoration of the translational reading frame of the dystrophin transcript.\r"

To determine whether immunosuppressant effects were important in mediating this improvement, we performed immunohistochemical analyses on muscle biopsies obtained at the conclusion of the trial. We studied 33 patients: 12 from the placebo group, nine from the low-dose prednisone group (0.75 mg/kg/d), and 12 from the high-dose group (1.5 mg/kg/d). There was a significant difference in total T cells (CD2+) between the placebo group and both treatment groups. Similarly, the number of CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor T cells was significantly decreased in both treated groups compared with placebo. The number of muscle fibers focally invaded by lymphocytes was also significantly decreased in the two treated groups compared with controls. There were no differences between the low- and high-dose groups. The numbers of B cells, natural killer cells, CD4+ cells, macrophages, and necrotic muscle fibers were not significantly different in the treated and control groups. This study suggests that prednisone may improve strength in Duchenne muscular dystrophy through primarily immunologic mechanisms involving T lymphocytes.\r"

The pattern of deficits was consistent with frontal-subcortical dysfunction. Of the four patients who had follow-up assessment, two had improved and two had deteriorated.

We used a modified \"butterfly\" stimulus coil with an easily defined excitation field to activate the C-8/T-1 nerve roots, recording over abductor digiti minimi. Locating both the lowest threshold for stimulation and the points of maximum stimulation, we determined the optimum rostral-caudal position and orientation for the stimulus coil over the posterior neck and upper trunk. The most favorable positions corresponded to the C-8/T-1 neural foramina, and the most favorable orientations to the roots within them. Additional measurements of depth and electric field suggested that the stimuli used should have been insufficient to activate nervous tissue in a homogeneous medium. A simple model indicates that the induced current is intensified where it passes through a bony foramen and explains preferential excitation of the nerve root at this site.\r"

These studies may overestimate the frequency in the general MS population, since the patients in these studies were recruited from clinic populations. In the present study, we administered a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery to 100 community-based MS patients and 100 demographically matched healthy controls. Of 31 cognitive test indices examined, 48 MS patients and five controls were impaired on four or more test indices, yielding an overall frequency rate of 43% for the MS group. The pattern of cognitive decline was not uniform: MS patients were more frequently impaired on measures of recent memory, sustained attention, verbal fluency, conceptual reasoning, and visuospatial perception, and less frequently impaired on measures of language and immediate and remote memory. We developed a brief (20-minute) screening battery empirically by selecting the four most sensitive test indices from the comprehensive battery. The brief battery yielded a sensitivity value of 71% and a specificity value of 94% in discriminating cognitively intact from impaired MS patients, as defined by the comprehensive battery. Cognitive impairment was not significantly associated with illness duration, depression, disease course, or medication usage, but was significantly (albeit weakly) correlated with physical disability.\r"

In addition to a neurologic examination, MS patients completed questionnaires on mood and social functioning, underwent a comprehensive in-home occupational therapy evaluation, and were rated by a close relative or friend regarding specific personality characteristics. While there were no significant differences between the two groups on measures of physical disability and illness duration, patients in the cognitively impaired group were less likely to be working, engaged in fewer social and avocational activities, reported more sexual dysfunction, experienced greater difficulty in performing routine household tasks, and exhibited more psychopathology than cognitively intact patients. These findings suggest that cognitive dysfunction is a major factor in determining the quality of life of patients with MS.\r"

We now report three patients with a previously undescribed syndrome of relapsing isolated acute transverse myelitis. Each had two to five attacks over periods of 3 to 8 years, characterized by ascending paresthesias, urinary retention, sensory loss with a thoracic or cervical level, paraparesis, hyperreflexia, and bilateral Babinski signs. MRI demonstrated areas of increased signal intensity on T2- and proton density-weighted scans and decreased signal intensity on T1-weighed scans of the cervical or thoracic spinal cord consistent with an inflammatory or demyelinating process. All patients had normal complete myelograms, oligoclonal IgG bands were consistently absent from the cerebrospinal fluid, cranial MRIs were normal, and there was no other clinical or laboratory evidence of MS, collagen-vascular disease, or active viral infection. They were treated with high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, stabilized between episodes, and had partial or complete recovery. The recognition of these three patients at a single medical center in a 1-year period suggests that relapses of acute transverse myelitis may not be rare.\r"

One patient refused lumbar puncture, one had normal CSF constituents except for an elevated Lyme antibody index, and two had CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis that remained unexplained after extensive evaluations for causes other than Lyme disease. We treated both patients who had CSF pleocytosis with intravenous ceftriaxone; the pleocytosis and optic nerve function improved. The other two patients received oral antibiotics and showed excellent recovery of visual acuity. We believe that serologic testing for Lyme disease is warranted for individuals with optic neuritis who reside in an endemic region, and patients with rising convalescent antibody levels or unexplained CSF pleocytosis should receive antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease.\r"

Oral intake of 75 grams glucose in 225 ml of water produced significant and prolonged hypotension in all patients and an increase in MSNA in all healthy subjects. Insulin and glucose responses were not significantly correlated with arterial blood pressure reduction. PPH was prevented by an infusion of vasopressin (0.3 U/min) given before glucose intake. These results suggest that PPH is caused by the lack of sympathetic compensation for the systemic hypotensive stress of splanchnic blood pooling that occurs after food ingestion, and that prior treatment with vasopressin reduces the portal venous flow by constricting the splanchnic vessels in patients with PPH.\r"

Concentrations of somatostatin are markedly diminished in Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting possible dysfunction of the intrinsic cortical neurons in which it is produced. We determined whether cortical levels of CCK might be similarly affected in AD by dissecting postmortem brain samples from 14 histologically confirmed cases of AD and 17 age-matched controls and measuring CCK and somatostatin by radioimmunoassay. CCK-like immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in the AD brains by 24 to 38% in five of the 11 cortical areas examined but was normal in the remaining regions. Somatostatin concentrations measured in the same tissue extracts were consistently decreased by 45 to 65%. These results indicate that (1) CCK-immunoreactive neurons in cortex are affected by the AD process, and (2) the changes in levels of CCK are less dramatic than the reductions of somatostatin immunoreactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Proper use of postmenopausal hormone replacement has been the subject of debate for decades. Prevailing medical opinion has swung between enthusiastic endorsement and extreme caution. The wave of optimism over estrogen's beneficial effects on menopausal symptoms and skeletal health was temporarily set back by the evidence that linked estrogen to endometrial cancer. Once studies showed that progestogen cotherapy could protect against this adverse effect, physicians were again encouraged to prescribe hormone replacement. Since 1980, increasing epidemiologic and experimental evidence has suggested a hitherto unappreciated and immense CHD health benefit from use of postmenopausal estrogen therapy. Although addition of progestogen may offset the cardiovascular benefits of estrogen slightly, its use is reasonable and practical. No woman need be subjected to unopposed estrogen's carcinogenic effects on her endometrium. Based on available evidence, hormone replacement therapy, appropriately administered, is both safe and beneficial. Unfortunately, there is no single way to prescribe it. The treating physician must make a series of best judgments. Practically speaking, this entails, in each case, finding the form of therapy that is acceptable to the patient and that provides the greatest health benefits with the least likelihood of adverse affects. Our prescribing habits have evolved in the last 15 to 20 years. We have better discrimination of the woman most likely to benefit; improved therapy through use of newer formulations, dosages, routes, and schedules; and more appropriate implementation of monitoring procedures. Although questions remain, we should not let our imperfect knowledge dissuade us from more widespread prescribing of hormone replacement therapy.\r"

Research suggests that numerous physiologic mechanisms act to increase fetal tolerance to the circulatory and respiratory challenges of moderate maternal exercise.

Even more encouraging is the fact that these benefits can be attained at moderate levels of exercise--if long-term compliance is maintained.\r"

  ".W": "Recognizing the enormous impact that quality breast screening mammography can have on reducing breast cancer deaths, we need to determine when women's and physician's perceived restrictions for mammography examination impede the progress of its use for early cancer detection. A uniform system should emphasize valid communication and education between women and their physicians. Women seek to have a voice in their medical treatment. Yet that responsibility has an emotional price. Physicians and patients must decide together on the most appropriate strategies to enhance communication and adopt specific guidelines they will adhere to, to detect and cure early breast cancer. Women must be educated about breast screening mammography, and physicians must increase their efforts to proclaim its importance. Women need be assured the trend is toward using the most modern mammographic techniques. Quality medical care is medicine's purpose and in women's best interest. At present, no other diagnostic method is equivalent to mammography and capable of providing an equivalent impact on improving the detection and cure rate of breast cancer. Despite medical activities designed to reduce uncertainty in medicine, scientific evidence has not provided systematic answers as to the \"best\" way to approach issues of quality, cost, accessibility, or communication for breast screening mammography. No particular expert opinion or preference prevails for breast screening protocols. What is needed is adoption of a multidisciplinary approach, educating and motivating women and physicians to participate in breast screening activities. With trends directed toward high-volume breast screening operations, low-cost, quality mammography must be available and be impeccably performed. Some activities are natural subjects for financial quantification. It is objectionable to assume, however, that we can accurately place and agree on dollar amounts alone to represent the costs and benefits of screening mammography. The gaps between practices and attitudes about the benefits, risks, and costs of screening mammography suggest that people are not satisfied with the way physicians, women, influential groups, or regulatory agencies are balancing all of the elements. Better communication must exist between physicians and their peer groups involved in performing responsible mammography. Better communication must be achieved between physicians and women to take advantage of the usefulness of quality breast screening mammography. High-quality screening programs must be linked to third-party reimbursement and to legislation, if we are to make a difference. Screening mammography deserves our medical, economic, social, and political attention and action.\r"

Operative techniques for surgical exposure and fracture reduction and fixation have evolved from standard facial incisions and wire fixation to complete exposure of the cranium and orbits via a bicoronal scalp flap, application of rigid plating techniques, and use of cranial bone grafts when necessary. This evolution of surgical techniques has been accompanied by an overall improvement in cosmetic and functional results.\r"

Operative time can be reduced if the pieces of the frontal bone are reassembled and stabilized with rigid fixation devices out of the surgical field and thus made ready for reinsertion as a single unit after any necessary neurosurgical procedures are completed. Immediate reconstruction provides postoperative protection for the brain and eliminates the need to return the patient to the operating room for cranioplasty at a later date.\r"

  ".U": "91227009\r", 
  ".W": "The management of penetrating wounds of the neck provides several decision-making steps that remain controversial. The two basic concepts of management include the idea that all wounds deep to the platysma should be explored and (the more conservative concept) that selective neck exploration should be based on a battery of tests to identify traumatic injuries. The areas of agreement within these two schools of thought include exploration of wounds with obvious injury, exploration of wounds in which patients cannot be stabilized satisfactorily for further testing, and the idea that all patients with wounds deep to the platysma should be admitted to the hospital. The remaining issues, including the need for angiography, barium swallow, or endoscopy, still are contested. Mandatory exploration of neck wounds became popular during World War II. The weapons used, the lack of accurate testing, and delays in treatment caused by transport problems played significant roles in the development of this policy. Proponents of mandatory exploration of neck wounds contend that delays in treatment result in increased mortality rates. Also delays caused by lengthy diagnostic testing have resulted in rapid exsanguination of patients who might otherwise have been surgically salvageable. These factors, along with the potential for undetected injuries and the associated complications (including false aneurysms and mediastinitis) favor mandatory exploration. Advocates of routine neck explorations also note the low morbidity rates associated with a neck exploration. Reported rates of negative exploration are high, however, approaching 45%, and mortality rates vary from 2% to 9%. Selective neck exploration has gained popularity in some centers because of the lower negative exploration rates associated with this treatment, while comparable mortality rates are achieved. May found a negative exploration rate of 12% in his series of selective neck explorations and a mortality rate of approximately 3%. Furthermore, Noyes found that the hospital stay for patients with selective observation management not requiring a neck exploration was 2.8 days, compared with 4.2 days for patients with mandatory but negative neck explorations. A summary of diagnostic techniques and their indications in selecting patients with penetrating neck wounds for surgery is presented in Table 5. It has become apparent that both selective and mandatory explorations of neck wounds play important roles in treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The SCSI has adequate internal consistency for a new instrument (.79) and moderate test-retest reliability for a changeable construct (.73 to .82). Construct validity was supported by significantly lower coping scores among children with one or more stress-related conditions compared to asymptomatic controls. Factor analysis suggests the SCSI is a one-factor instrument. Low correlations between the SCSI and related but different constructs (stressors and self-esteem) measured by two different methods (self-report and observation) in a multitrait-multimethod matrix showed divergent validity. Convergent validity with the Coping Inventory was not demonstrated.\r"

Questionnaires were randomly assigned to 600 acute care nurses. Although AIDS-related risk factors were not found to influence ANCS scores, a non-AIDS medical diagnosis and DNR orders significantly reduced aggressiveness of nursing care attitudes. Study findings did not vary according to nurses' age, academic preparation, or previous practice experience with persons with AIDS or DNR orders.\r"

A convenience sampling technique was used to obtain subjects from AIDS support groups and affiliated agencies in a major southwest urban area. Ninety-five HIV-infected subjects completed a demographic data sheet, the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), and the Symptom Distress Scale (SDS). The majority of subjects (59%) listed AIDS as their category of diagnosis, 25% were HIV+ only and 16% identified ARC as their disease classification. Subjects had SIP and SDS scores which indicated HIV-infection significantly affected their quality of life. Multivariate results indicated that quality of life indicators varied as a function of HIV classification. HIV-infection had the greatest disruption in psychosocial aspects of life. The impact of HIV-infection (both physical and psychosocial) was greatest in subjects with ARC and least among subjects who were HIV+ only.\r"

Daily stress was hypothesized to affect perceived health status both directly and through the mediating variables of introspectiveness and coping efforts. A sample of 159 female adolescents completed the Hassles Scale, the Ways of Coping Checklist-Revised, the Introspectiveness Scale for Adolescents and the General Health Rating Index. The causal model was tested using the LISREL VI program. Findings indicated that the model fit the data, indicating a plausible representation of the relationships among the variables identified (x2 = 15.76, df = 12, p less than .203). Daily stress was significantly negatively related to perceived health status through the mediating variables of introspection and problem-focused coping but not emotion-focused coping. Introspectiveness had a significant direct effect on perceived health status. Problem-focused coping was found to have a direct positive effect on perceived health status.\r"

When effects were moderate, the mean power increased to .71, which is still below the conventionally acceptable power of .80. Only when a study involved large effects was the power adequate (mean of .95). Of the 583 power estimates calculated, 53% were for small effects. These analyses indicate that a substantial number of published nursing studies, and presumably even more of unpublished studies, have insufficient power to detect real effects, primarily because the samples used are too small.\r"

Nighttime users were more likely to have private physicians, were ill for shorter periods of time, were more likely to attempt treatment at home prior to arriving at the ED, tended to use the ED more often, and spent their days outside of the home (in school or daycare), as compared with the daytime controls (P less than 0.05). The average waiting time was longer during the night than during the day (7:00 AM to 5:00 PM). The prime reasons for presenting for care during the night (as well as during the day), according to the caretaker, were illness concerns and not those of convenience.\r"

Thirty-six wounds were assessed. No clinical or histologic evidence of infection or necrosis was present in any wound. Five wounds (two in the lidocaine and three in the EMLA group, P = 1.0) demonstrated a widened scar owing to healing by secondary intention following suture disruption. There was no significant difference between groups in the degree of inflammation (P = 0.08). We conclude that EMLA does not affect wound healing adversely and is comparable to 1% lidocaine infiltration in the animal model. Further study to determine its anesthetic effect in laceration repair is presently being undertaken.\r"

Although many debates about this issue have taken place within the physical therapy profession, assumptions about practice patterns have generally not been studied. This article reports some of the first-year findings from a 3-year survey research effort begun in September 1988 by Mathematica Policy Research Inc for the American Physical Therapy Association. Analyses are based on survey data from national probability samples of physical therapy facilities and discharged patients from 155 hospital-based and 166 private outpatient practices. The primary goal was to compare outpatient physical therapy practice patterns in the hospital-based and private practice settings. Findings reveal considerable homogeneity in private and hospital-based outpatient physical therapy practices. Hospital-based and private practices serve predominantly young, white adults who have private health insurance and a prevalence of orthopedic impairments. In both settings, direct access to outpatient physical therapy services was the exception and not the rule. Even in states in which direct access without a physician's referral was permitted by law, the majority of outpatient physical therapy was provided with a physician's referral. Most respondents in direct-access states indicated that reimbursement requirements were the major reason for needing a physician's referral to provide outpatient physical therapy.\r"

Results were based on the experiences of 35 chapters, 17 in direct-access states and 18 in non-direct-access states. The majority of direct-access states obtained their status in a single legislative campaign; the majority of non-direct-access jurisdictions attempting legislative change have been unsuccessful for 2 or more years. Over 80% of the chapters reported using legislative lobbyists. Opposing forces varied from state to state and included hospital and medical associations, physicians, chiropractors, and physical therapists. The following limitations on practice in a direct-access mode are found in the various practice acts: diagnosis requirements, eventual referral requirements, physical therapist qualifications, patient consent requirements, and practice setting restrictions.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the test-retest reliability of isokinetic torque measurements in the involved and uninvolved knee musculature of 20 subjects with spastic hemiparesis. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure maximal voluntary knee extension and flexion at 60 degrees and 120 degrees/s. Peak torque (PT) and average peak torque (APT) data were collected from five repetitions on two separate occasions. Average peak torque was defined as the mean of the PT values obtained during each of the five repetitions. Spasticity was measured in the involved knee musculature prior to isokinetic testing using the Ashworth Scale. Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were high (greater than or equal to .90) for both knees for PT and APT at both angular velocities. No clinically meaningful differences were found between the Pearson correlation coefficients and the ICCs of the involved versus the uninvolved knee for any testing conditions. We concluded that isokinetic evaluation of torque, as measured by PT and APT in subjects with spastic hemiparesis, can yield reliable results in both extremities.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) (2,500-pps sine wave interrupted at 50 bps) on the degree of microvascular perfusion in stimulated skeletal muscle. The tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of 36 male rats were treated with NMES for 30 minutes at current amplitudes sufficient to produce a sustained muscle contraction (motor NMES). Muscle tissue was removed at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after NMES. The perfused vessel/muscle fiber ratio (PV/F) of the stimulated animals at time 0 minutes was greater than that of the unstimulated control animals. A gradual decrease in the magnitude of the PV/F increase was noted over time. Depending on the muscle's fiber-type composition, the PV/F values returned to control levels by 10 to 30 minutes after motor NMES. The results indicate (1) that motor NMES significantly increases the degree of microvascular perfusion in stimulated rat skeletal muscle and (2) that the increased degree of perfusion persists for various lengths of time, depending on the fiber-type composition of the muscle. Thus, if responses in an animal model can be used as indicators of similar human responses, then the results of this study suggest that NMES can be used to increase the degree of microvascular perfusion in human skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "A new approach to probe the structure of trabecular bone in the vertebral bodies in humans was evaluated, and preliminary data are presented. The proposed method is based on the hypothesis that the presence of two physical phases--bone and bone marrow--causes a magnetic field distribution across the imaging voxel. The resulting spread in resonance frequency produces line broadening, which is measured as the decay rate of the region of interest signal intensity that has the properties of an interferogram. The interferogram is the result of two principal chemically shifted components of bone marrow--fat and water--getting in and out of phase with one another while being attenuated by T2* processes from the magnetic field distribution within the measuring volume. The time constant for the decay (T2*) can then be obtained by means of curve-fitting techniques. T2* in healthy persons is found to increase slightly with age. However, patients with osteoporosis (low bone mineral density and/or spine compression fractures) have significantly prolonged T2* values, which are interpreted as arising from an increase in the intertrabecular space.\r"

  ".W": "The use of magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) in magnetic resonance imaging of the human knee was evaluated in this study. MTC is generated by irradiating the macromolecular protons in tissue with a low power off-resonance radio-frequency field. This results in a decrease in water proton signal intensity where a tight magnetic coupling between water and macromolecules exists. With this approach, the authors have demonstrated that MTC can improve contrast in standard single-section, gradient-recalled-echo images of the knee with regard to fat-muscle and cartilage-synovial fluid comparisons. The effect of changes in repetition time, echo time, and flip angle were also quantitatively evaluated. More important, MTC was shown to generate useful cartilage-synovial fluid contrast on high-resolution three-dimensional images, in which contrast is difficult to generate. This approach may not only provide better structural information about the knee, but may also provide noninvasive insight into the structure and biochemical composition of cartilage in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Because truncation artifacts on magnetic resonance (MR) images may be confused with meniscal tears, measures to suppress them were investigated in a human cadaver knee and prospective and retrospective studies of patients. The artifacts were most prominent when the acquisition matrix was 128 x 256 and the 128-pixel (phase-encoded) axis was in a superoinferior (SI) orientation. An anteroposterior (AP) orientation of the 128-pixel axis or use of a 256 x 256 acquisition matrix reduced the prominence of or nearly eliminated the artifacts. A review of reports of MR imaging and arthroscopic examinations of 83 knees yielded eight menisci that were falsely interpreted at MR imaging as having tears. Retrospective review of the images suggested that the errors were due to truncation artifacts in two cases. Truncation artifacts will cause relatively little difficulty if diagnostic observers are aware of their characteristics and simple steps are taken to minimize their prominence, including acquiring images in 192 x 256 or 256 x 256 matrices or AP rather than SI orientation of the phase-encoded (128-pixel) axis of 128 x 256 matrices.\r"
