Functional residual capacity was reduced by a mean of 26%, 18% of children showing a reduction of greater than 40%. The mean reduction in total lung capacity was 16% and in forced vital capacity 18%. This restriction of lung function by bracing might have a deleterious effect on lung growth or might impose an additional risk factor in the presence of other disorders, such as asthma and diaphragmatic weakness. The use of bracing in individuals with mild scoliosis should be judiciously reassessed.\r"

We studied 44 male patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (mean (SD) FEV1 39% (14%) of predicted normal) who were not having long term corticosteroids. No differences in a vertebral deformity score or in metacarpal index were found between them and a control group of similar age. Indices of bone formation (serum osteocalcin) and bone resorption (urinary hydroxyproline) were normal and parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were also normal. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was decreased, indicating depleted vitamin D. Calcitonin concentrations were higher in the patient than in the control group of the same age. There was no increase in the prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease who had not received long term corticosteroid treatment. Increased concentrations of calcitonin may protect the skeleton from the detrimental effect of hypovitaminosis D.\r"

A cytological diagnosis of malignancy was made from the first biopsy in 473 patients (69%). A second biopsy was performed in 43 patients, a diagnosis of malignancy being made in a further 16 cases (37%). Histological material was available for comparison with cytological findings in 203 patients. Cytological examination was reliable in the diagnosis of malignancy with a high yield (75%) and low false positive rate (1.5%). Specific benign lesions were correctly diagnosed in 10 patients (1.5%). There was a false negative rate for the diagnosis of malignancy of 18% for the patients with a subsequent histological diagnosis. This compares with a false negative rate of 9% overall; the true rate probably lies between these figures. These results imply that a cytology report indicating no evidence of malignancy, but not diagnostic of a specific benign condition, does not reliably exclude a malignant lesion. In this series cytological typing was not accurate at predicting the cell type determined by histological examination (61% agreement) and was not able to discriminate between small cell and non-small cell lung cancer.\r"

The specimens of small cell carcinoma were readily differentiated from those containing lymphocytes by the argyrophil method, the range of mean number of nucleolar organiser regions per nucleus being 4.2-7.3 for small cell carcinoma cells and 0.9-1.7 for lymphocytes. This method separates malignant epithelial cells from benign lymphocytic cells and has potential in both clinical and research investigation of respiratory tumours.\r"

  ".W": "Solitary fibrous tumour of the pleura is a benign neoplasm differing from diffuse pleural mesothelioma. It was originally thought to be a variant of mesothelioma because it consists of a spindle cell stroma associated with branching tubular structures lined by cuboidal cells. In this study of two cases the tubular structures were lined with ciliated and non-ciliated cuboidal cells. Ultrastructurally most of the non-ciliated cells had the features of type II pneumocytes, while the stromal cells had all the characteristics of fibroblasts. Immunohistochemical staining showed the epithelial cells to be positive for both keratin and carcinoembryonic antigen, whereas the stromal cells were negative. The findings support the theory that these tumours are fibroblastic in origin, and that the biphasic pattern is due to entrapment of non-neoplastic bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells.\r"

To determine the risk linked to contemporary proximal deep venous thrombosis, a prospective study was organised to give clinical and scintigraphic surveillance to 50 patients with angiographically proved pulmonary embolism plus phlebographically proved proximal deep vein thrombosis during the first 15 days of anticoagulant treatment. Perfusion lung scans were performed initially and on days 3, 7, and 15. Only two patients had a recurrence of pulmonary embolism during this period; both episodes were revealed by new symptoms, and one recurrence was fatal. The systematic performance of angiography in four patients found to have new scintigraphic defects led to the diagnosis of \"spurious scintigraphic recurrence\" in three of them. It is concluded that (a) adjusted anticoagulant treatment showed an effectiveness of 96% for preventing early recurrence of pulmonary embolism in this group of supposed high risk patients, and (b) in patients with recent pulmonary embolism new defects on systematic perfusion lung scans are not specific indicators of recurrent pulmonary embolism.\r"

The range of initial FEV1 was 0.5-4.71 and the natural variability over a 20 minute period when expressed in absolute terms was similar over the entire range, and differed insignificantly from that found in normal subjects. The increase in FEV1 and vital capacity (VC) required to exclude natural variability with 95% confidence in these patients was 160 ml and 330 ml respectively. Natural variability when expressed in percentage terms was negatively correlated with the level of FEV1 recorded. The analysis of changes in FEV1 and VC after administration of bronchodilator used absolute and percentage criteria for response. The number of responders differed considerably according to the criterion used. In those defined by the absolute criterion as responders there was no evidence that size of response was related to level of FEV1. Percentage criteria have traditionally been used to identify responses to bronchodilator that may be clinically useful, while absolute criteria, although statistically valid, have not been favoured. Reappraisal of the criteria used and their limitations and implications is required.\r"

All used a nebulised beta agonist (usually 5 mg salbutamol) as first line treatment for severe acute asthma or reversible obstructive lung disease. Twenty three doctors used ipratropium bromide occasionally and 38 used it frequently, usually mixing ipratropium and a beta agonist in the nebuliser chamber. Only five doctors routinely specified whether the nebuliser should be driven by air or by oxygen. In the case of a hypercapnic patient with chronic bronchitis, 11 respondents would not specify which gas should be used and a further 14 would use oxygen, a potentially dangerous practice. In the case of a hypoxic asthmatic patient, 22 doctors would not prescribe oxygen as the driving gas. The driving gas flow rate was almost invariably determined by nursing staff. Intravenous aminophylline was used by all 67 respondents (52 of them frequent users) but only 24 used intravenous beta agonists (five of them frequent users). It is concluded that nebulised bronchodilator drugs are the most commonly used treatment for acute asthma and reversible obstructive lung disease in hospital, but further instruction in their use is required for the staff who use them most frequently.\r"

To determine the site of response to ingested ice and acid they were challenged with ice or dilute hydrochloric acid, which was orally retained on one day and swallowed on another. On a third day a placebo was given. The airway response was assessed by measuring FEV1 and the provocative concentration of histamine that reduced the FEV1 by at least 20% (PC20). There was no significant change in FEV1 or histamine PC20 after placebo or the orally retained challenges for the group as a whole or for any individual. After the ice and hydrochloric acid had been swallowed there was a small but statistically significant mean fall in FEV1, increasing to a maximum 90 minutes after ingestion, together with a significant increase in bronchial responsiveness. As conditioning of the inspired air would have been similar after orally retained and after swallowed ice or acid, the response is likely to be due to oesophageal stimulation. The mechanism of the response to oesophageal stimulation is unclear, but the slow time course seems to preclude a simple neural reflex.\r"

In 29 of the 56 patients the tumour mass was canalised by a neodymium-YAG laser immediately before the afterloading delivery tube was introduced. In 44 (79%) of the patients, there was impressive relief of dyspnoea, accompanied by tumour regression observed at endoscopy and also by highly significant improvement in ventilatory function values, lung perfusion scans, and levels of arterial oxygen tension. In the other 12 patients (21%) there was no detectable improvement. The findings suggest that this recently developed combination treatment is of value in patients with advanced tumours of the trachea and main bronchi in whom there is no possibility of further treatment by external irradiation or repeated laser coagulation.\r"

Most patients presented in infancy with respiratory symptoms and malabsorption, but 19 (6%) were diagnosed in adult life, three in their 30s. Pulmonary disease was almost universal (99.7%), being responsible for 97% of all deaths and three quarters of hospital admissions. All patients had developed a productive cough by the age of 21 and over half before the age of 5. Many complained of wheezing, but reversible airflow obstruction was present in only 40% of those tested. Minor haemoptysis was very common (62%), but major episodes less so (10%). Pneumothorax was seen in 61 cases (19%), and was often recurrent. Some irreversible airflow obstruction was present in all patients with pulmonary disease. Two patients have been followed for over 20 years without showing appreciable decline in lung function. Thirty five patients (11%) had no symptoms of malabsorption. Acute meconium ileus equivalent was seen in 16% and a chronic partial obstruction with episodic symptoms in a further 19%. Diabetes mellitus developed in 36 patients, 13 of whom were insulin dependent. Hepatomegaly was common (29%), often occurring without abnormal results in biochemical tests of liver function; only 1% of patients developed portal hypertension with varices and ascites. Skin reactions to at least one common allergen, including Aspergillus fumigatus, were positive in 70%, but very few patients suffered from hay fever or eczema. One hundred and twenty one patients have died, 97% from infection or other pulmonary complications, and 195 were alive in December 1983 (mean age 23 years). Seventy eight per cent of patients were in full time education or full or part time employment, or were housewives, and only 41 were unemployed for reasons for health. Many patients are married and 10 women have borne children. Most patients were admitted to hospital only three or four times during the period of follow up and 50 individuals (16%) have never been in hospital at all. The improvement in prognosis and quality of life for adults with cystic fibrosis should encourage a positive attitude in those who care for them.\r"

The reported 12 month period prevalence of the symptom \"ever wheezy\" was 15%, 18%, and 17% respectively in the three ethnic groups (differences not significant). In a subsample of 973 European, 47 African, and 40 Indian children forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were significantly lower by 12% and 13% in Africans and by 8% and 9% in Indians than in Europeans after adjustment to the group mean height of 128 cm. No significant ethnic variation was found for forced mid expiratory flow, FEV1/FVC, or mean transit time. Since the lung function studies were performed on a sample from a large population with little variation in respiratory morbidity, the differences are likely to reflect human biological differences. Separate prediction equations need to be developed for the different ethnic groups in childhood.\r"

Because this therapy was well tolerated and appeared safe, a double-blind, placebo-controlled IVIG immunotherapy pilot study was performed on 35 hospitalized, RSV-infected infants and children. The treatment was well tolerated and resulted in significant reductions in nasal RSV shedding and in improvements in transcutaneous oximetry readings. However, the mean duration of hospitalization was not reduced by IVIG treatment. Followup to date has revealed no harmful effects resulting from immunotherapy of RSV infections. These studies appear to refute the hypothesis that passively acquired antibody may exacerbate RSV bronchiolitis or pneumonia in infants. Studies with larger numbers of seriously ill children will be required to determine if immunoglobulin G immunotherapy of RSV infections in infants is of clinical value.\r"

Lincomycin showed a high intracellular-to-extracellular ratio (3.0), while clindamycin achieved a ratio of 15.5, which was the highest ratio of all of the 19 tested antibiotics. Ratios for rifampin, isoniazid, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim were 8.2, 1.1, 9.6, and 6.1, respectively. Six quinolone-class antimicrobial agents had ratios from 2.2 to 8.2. Flucytosine showed a penetration ratio of 4.6. Clindamycin uptake was temperature dependent and occurred best with live polymorphonuclear leukocytes; sodium fluoride, adenosine, and puromycin were inhibitory. The results obtained in this study correlate well with the results of other studies involving radioisotopic methods. This indicates that high-performance liquid chromatography is a useful method for determining the intracellular penetration of antimicrobial agents.\r"

Lantz, L.M. Switalski, K.S. Kornman, and M. Hook, J. Bacteriol. 163:623-628, 1985). We examined the effect of growth in subinhibitory levels (sub-MICs) of tetracycline on fibrinogen binding by these bacteria and found concentration-dependent inhibition of fibrinogen binding by bacteria grown in the presence of tetracycline over the range of tetracycline concentrations from 1/64 to 1/8 the MIC. Analysis of the binding data suggests that bacteria grown in the presence of sub-MICs of tetracycline bind fewer fibrinogen molecules per cell than do bacteria grown in the absence of the drug. If fibrinogen-mediated adherence is important in the establishment B. intermedius in periodontal lesions and lesions of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, then tetracycline may be effective in disrupting establishment of these organisms at concentrations well below those required to achieve a bacteriostatic effect.\r"

Regimens of nafcillin, cefazolin, cefamandole, and vancomycin were compared for efficacy in the prevention of infection caused by two methicillin-resistant strains and a susceptible strain. For the two resistant strains, vancomycin was the most effective drug tested. All regimens were effective against the susceptible strain. The two strains for which prophylaxis with beta-lactam antibiotics failed produced a beta-lactam antibiotic-inducible penicillin-binding protein (PBP) that comigrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the low-affinity PBP 2a that is associated with methicillin resistance in strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Like PBP 2a, this PBP had low binding affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. Peptide maps after either V8 protease or chymotrypsin digestion of radiolabeled PBP 2a or silver-stained preparations were virtually identical to one another and to maps of PBP 2a from a heterogeneous and a homogeneous strain of S. aureus. Methicillin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci and therapeutic failure with beta-lactam antibiotics in vivo is associated with production of PBP 2a, which appears to be highly conserved structurally among different species of staphylococci.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six subtotally nephrectomized dogs were used as a model for subclinical renal dysfunction to evaluate the nephrotoxic potential of gentamicin administered according to four different dosage regimens. Dosages were individualized based on the pharmacokinetic disposition of drug in each dog. Gentamicin at 3.75 +/- 0.15 mg/kg (mean +/- standard error of the mean, total daily dose) was given for 12 days in two or three divided daily doses (BID and TID, respectively) or in a 2-h or 4-h once-daily variable-rate infusion (2HI and 4HI, respectively) with loading dose. Analyses of serum chemistries and pharmacokinetic data were performed on the ratio of pretreatment versus posttreatment parameters in individual animals. While serum chemistries and histopathology revealed no significant differences in toxicity between treatment groups, pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a significant difference in the ratio of pretreatment versus posttreatment gentamicin clearance (1.35 +/- 0.22, BID; 2.44 +/- 0.52, TID; 0.91 +/- 0.08, 2HI; 0.91 +/- 0.07, 4HI). By using mean population pharmacokinetic parameters (all dogs), predicted times for each treatment group administered 3.75 mg/kg per day to achieve concentrations in serum above the MICs of 2, 4, 6, and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively, were 7.8, 4.2, 2.0, and 0.6 (BID); 6.1, 3.0, 0.5, and 0.2 (TID); 7.1, 5.3, 4.2, and 3.5 (2HI); and 7.4, 5.8, 4.8, and 4.0 (4HI) h daily. This study suggests that decreasing the total daily dosage of drug may decrease the incidence of gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. Regardless of the dosage regimen, however, regimens may differ significantly in predicted therapeutic efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Expression of methicillin resistance in heterogeneous strains of Staphylococcus aureus is enhanced by 2 to 5% NaCl in the medium and by selection with beta-lactam antibiotics. Resistance is associated with production of a penicillin-binding protein (PBP), PBP 2a, with low affinity for binding beta-lactam antibiotics. Therefore, the effects of NaCl and nafcillin on amounts of PBP 2a produced and its binding affinity were examined and correlated with expression of resistance. Nafcillin-triggered autolysis also was examined. No relationships between the level of resistance expressed and (i) relative amounts of PBP 2a, (ii) inducibility of PBP 2a by nafcillin, or (iii) binding affinity of nafcillin for PBP 2a were found. A protective effect of NaCl for the susceptible subpopulation, corresponding to inhibition of autolysis, was observed for heterogeneous strains. Even in the absence of NaCl, highly resistant cells were relatively tolerant to nafcillin-triggered autolysis. These results support the hypothesis that high levels of resistance require an additional factor besides PBP 2a. This factor may act within the autolytic pathway.\r"

Proposed here is a novel in vitro method called the membrane transfer technique, which acknowledges those aspects unique to localized pathogenic infections, particularly those associated with anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial lawns representing six suspected periodontopathic bacteria were prepared on membranes and then placed in contact with different concentrations of antimicrobial agents for 5 min. After incubation for 12 to 24 h, MBCs were determined with the aid of a tetrazolium chloride indicator. Four antimicrobial agents (chlorhexidine, iodine, stannous fluoride, and sodium fluoride) were used to test the applicability of the proposed in vitro method. MBCs were derived for each agent except sodium fluoride against all or most of the six bacterial strains tested. The proposed method may also be useful for examining the bactericidal action of topically applied antimicrobial agents against nonoral infections.\r"

To evaluate community and occupational exposure to TCE, we conducted environmental and medical surveys. In well water samples obtained in August 1979 within 1 km of the factory, TCE concentrations ranged to 183,000 parts per billion (ppb); EPA's proposed guideline for TCE in drinking water is 5 ppb. Levels of TCE declined with distance from the plant and decreased in the months following the spill. However, lower level TCE contamination was widespread and persistent, suggesting multiple releases. Within the plant, mean time-weighted occupational exposure to TCE of degreaser operators was 205 mg/m3; the recommended time-weighted exposure limit is 135 mg/m3. Mean short-term exposure was 1,084 mg/m3; the recommended short-term limit is 535 mg/m3. Seven of 9 exposed workers reported drowsiness, dizziness, or mental confusion. In exposed workers, mean urinary excretion of TCE metabolites rose from 298 micrograms/L pre-shift to 480 micrograms/L post-shift. On re-evaluation of the factory following improvements in ventilation and work practices, mean time-weighted occupational exposure to TCE had decreased to 84 mg/m3 and short-term exposure to 400 mg/m3; symptom frequency and concentrations of urinary TCE metabolites also were reduced. This episode demonstrates that community and occupational exposure to chemical toxins may share a common origin.\r"

The median level of lead in bone in 27 active lead workers was 29 micrograms/g wet weight (range 2-155), corresponding to 370 micrograms/g calcium (range 30-1,120). In 9 retired workers, the corresponding levels were 19 micrograms/g (5-76) and 250 micrograms/g calcium (60-700); in 14 reference subjects without occupational exposure, 1.3 micrograms/g (1-4) and 13 micrograms/g calcium (8-40). The bone lead content rose with time of exposure. Comparison of levels in vertebra with those in fingerbone, as measured by in vivo x-ray fluorescence in the same subjects, strongly suggested the presence of lead pools with different kinetics. The accumulation pattern, as well as the relation between levels in vertebra and fingerbone, suggests a much shorter half-time of lead in the mainly trabecular vertebral bone as compared to the mainly cortical fingerbone. Further, there was an association between vertebral and blood lead levels in the retired workers, which shows a considerable endogenous lead exposure from the skeletal pool.\r"

  ".W": "Eight symptomatic individuals chronically exposed to indoor formaldehyde (HCHO) at low concentrations (0.07-0.55 ppm) were compared to 8 nonexposed subjects with respect to: (1) presence of IgG and IgE antibodies to HCHO conjugated to human serum albumin (F-HSA); (2) the percentage of venous blood T and B cells by E and EAC-rosetting; and (3) the ability of T and B cells to undergo mitogen (PHA, PWM) stimulated blastogenesis as measured by the incorporation of tritiated thymidine. Anti-F-HSA IgG, but no IgE, antibodies were detected in the sera of the 8 exposed subjects; none were found in 7 of the unexposed controls. T lymphocytes were decreased in the exposed (48 +/- 11.5%) compared to the control (65.9 +/- 4.97%) subjects (p greater than .001 less than .01). B cells were 12.6 +/- 1.6% (HCHO group) and 14.75 +/- 2.1% (controls) (p greater than .02 less than .05). The incorporation of labeled thymidine by T cells (PHA) was decreased: 17,882 +/- 2,293 cpm (HCHO group) and 28,576 +/- 3,807 cpm (p greater than .001 less than .01). T and B cell blastogenesis (PWM) was 9,698 +/- 1,441 cpm (HCHO group) and 11,279 +/- 1,711 (controls) (p greater than .05 less than .1). Exposure to HCHO appears to stimulate IgG antibodies to F-HSA and decrease the proportion of peripheral T cells.\r"

The six indices of dust exposure were cumulative and \"peak\" respirable dust, quartz, and iron oxide. Both iron oxide indices were not significant at the 5% level for either ILO Category 1 or Categories 2,3. The association between dust composition and ILO radiologic category for simple pneumoconiosis was consistent, with respirable quartz being the best differentiating index between the case and control groups.\r"

Human pancreatic juice was sampled by endoscopic cannulation after administration of secretin (intravenous [i.v.], 1 mu/kg). There were 19 subjects (11 males and 8 females) and the means of their ages were 50.3 yr (male, 20-68 yr) and 52.5 yr (female, 45-64 yr). Diagnoses were: normal, 5; early pancreatic cancer, 9; and chronic pancreatitis, 5. None had symptoms suggestive of disturbances in endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas. Concentrations of metals and protein in pancreatic juice did not change significantly between males and females or with pathological changes in the pancreas. Assuming the flow rate of pancreatic juice to be 1500-2000 ml/day, the daily excretions of metals into duodenum via pancreatic juice were calculated as follows (mumoles of metal/day): Cd, 0.012-0.012; Pb, 0.216-0.288; Cu, 6.20-8.26; Fe, 2.34-3.12; Mn, 0.100-0.133; Co, 0.165-0.220; Zn, 7.46-9.94; Cr, 0.084-0.112; Mg, 274.1-365.4; Ni, 1.64-2.18; and Ca, 0.221-0.295. Toxic (Cd and Pb) and essential metals (Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Cr, and Ni) are excreted daily into duodenum via pancreatic juice.\r"

  ".W": "Individuals who paint cars often complain to doctors about respiratory problems. Car painters are exposed to isocyanates, especially hexamethylendiisocyanate (HDI), and biuret modified HDI (HDI-BT). The mean exposure to HDI-BT was 115 micrograms/m3 in the air (range 10-385 micrograms/m3), which exceeds the time-weighted Swedish threshold level of 90 micrograms/m3. Exposure to HDI was about 1.0 microgram/m3 with brief peaks. This study investigated the effect of HDI and HDI-BT on lung function and included two control groups: (1) car platers, exposed to the same solvents and grinding dust as car painters, but not to isocyanates, and (2) car mechanics (controls), not exposed to the mentioned agents. Car painters and car platers were compared to car mechanics on Monday before work. Acute effects of car painting were tested by comparing the lung function values on Monday morning with those on Friday afternoon. Pulmonary function was evaluated by means of spirometry and a single breath nitrogen washout. Spirometry in painters and platers did not differ from that in controls, i.e., car mechanics. Closing volume in relation to vital capacity (CV%) was increased in car painters, suggestive of a \"small airways disease\" on Monday before work and tended to increase during a work week. Car platers did not differ from controls.\r"

The average respirable quartz concentration from inspector samples ranged from .34-.49 mg/m3 for drilling jobs and .18 mg/m3 for bulldozer operators. For most other surface coal mine jobs, the average respirable quartz concentration was less than .1 mg/m3, and the average respirable dust concentration was less than 2 mg/m3. The results from the analysis of quartz exposures are consistent with epidemiological results for an increased silicosis risk among drillers. It is unclear, however, whether the MSHA samples provide a representative estimate of the average annual quartz concentration for drillers. Results suggest the need for a greater number of quartz samples to be taken on strip coal miners, particularly on drillers and bulldozer operators.\r"

With a 95% confidence interval, the true response rate to DHAD was less than 8%, and to DDP, less than 17%. The median survival time was 14 weeks on both drugs. Assuming a proportional hazards model, factors that are significantly associated with survival are patient performance status, the presence of the symptoms, raised bilirubin and hepatomegaly, and clinical evidence of cirrhosis. Any differences between survival rates for South African and North American patients were largely explainable by these factors.\r"

Ten patients have lived more than 2 years. Six of these patients have undergone total thoracic esophagectomy after the induction chemotherapy. Determination of the ultimate benefits of combined modality therapy may require prospective randomized trials isolating the major treatment components but our data suggest that chemotherapy contributes to improved results in this disease and that drug therapy is emerging as an integral component of combined therapy.\r"

The higher doses of prochlorperazine proved to be effective in the control of cisplatin-induced emesis. For the 20 patients who completed all 4 study cycles of treatment, a relationship was discerned between the dose of prochlorperazine administered and the antiemetic effect. When all 71 patients were analyzed in terms of the results of the first cycle of chemotherapy, a significant dose-response effect was also found. Overall toxic reactions in 82 treatment cycles using either 30 mg or 40 mg of prochlorperazine were dystonia (1 patient), restlessness (2), hypotension (3), and drowsiness (12). This study demonstrates that higher-than-conventional doses of prochlorperazine have an impressive antinauseant effect with only moderate toxicity.\r"

Of 31 evaluable patients, 29 (94%) achieved remission after receiving a median of four courses of therapy. Two patients who failed to respond to pulse therapy were subsequently cured by alternative treatment. There were 93 toxic events in 133 cycles of therapy. Ninety-two percent of adverse effects were graded as mild or moderate, and 8% were graded as severe. No life-threatening toxicity occurred. Although single-dose ACT-D efficacy and toxicity is comparable to conventional therapy for NMGTD, the advantages of easier administration, greater patient convenience, and improved cost-effectiveness make it superior to other alternatives. On this basis it is recommended as the treatment of choice for NMGTD.\r"

To evaluate the role of radiation therapy, the Duke University Medical Center series was retrospectively analyzed. Clinical history, radiation dosages, and pathologic materials were reviewed. Seventy-one patients were identified as having histologically proven oligodendroglioma. Analysis of the patient population demonstrated it to be similar in all major parameters to other populations previously reported in the literature. Multivariate statistical analysis of the demographic, clinical and radiographic variables of these patients showed that a poorer prognosis was associated with persons of increased age (P = 0.052) and black persons (P = 0.014), and in those with papilledema (P = 0.07), hemiparesis (P = 0.001), intellectual deficits (P = 0.0002), and necrosis (P = 0.041). All patients had a surgical procedure as first treatment while 18 and three patients, respectively, underwent a second and third surgical procedure. Thirty-seven patients had a subsequent course of radiotherapy. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis comparing the patients treated with surgery alone those treated with surgery plus radiotherapy revealed no significant population or prognostic differences between the groups. The median times until clinical deterioration were 39 versus 27 months, the median times until documented tumor recurrence were 27 versus 28 months and the median survival times were 4.5 versus 5.2 years, for nonirradiated versus irradiated patients. These data, from a large and rigidly evaluated population, demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the symptom-free interval, time until tumor recurrence, or survival between the groups nor did radiation appear beneficial to any subgroup evaluated. The results suggest the need for a prospective clinical trial to evaluate the true role of radiation therapy in the treatment of this tumor.\r"

In Group 1 three pheochromocytoma were depicted by MIBG scintiscan. In Group 2 MTC was seen in a small number of patients (3 of 24). In Group 3, besides adrenal hyperplasia and pheochromocytoma four patients, MIBG scintigraphy showed where MTC had localized and spread in almost half of patients (7 of 15). MIBG uptake occurred in patients with relatively high calcitonin level (greater than 0.6 nmol/l).

The treatment consisted of external beam and intracavitary therapy designed to deliver 7000 to 8000 rad to Point A and 5000 to 5500 rad to the pelvic lymph nodes. The 2-, 5-, and 10-year, disease-free survival rates were 87%, 83%, and 81%, respectively. Thirty-six patients developed recurrent and/or metastatic disease. The sites that failed to remain disease-free were: locoregional in five patients (3%), locoregional with distant metastases in 15 patients (8%), and distant metastases only in 14 patients (7%). In addition, there were two patients (1%) who are considered to have died of disease but the site or sites of recurrence could not be determined. Thirty-nine patients developed complications. The complications were mild and self-limiting--Grade I--in 24 patients (12%) and of moderate severity--Grade II--in eight patients (4%). Seven patients (4%) developed severe--Grade III--complications. A correlation was found between the dose to Point A, the bladder, and the rectum and the complications. The mean dose to Point A for patients without and with complications were 7453 rad (SE +/- 91) and 7737 (SE +/- 124), respectively, with a P value of .05. The mean dose to the bladder for patients without and with urinary complications was 5590 rad (SE +/- 103) and 6335 rad (SE +/- 411), respectively, with a P value of 0.14. The mean dose to the rectum for patients without and with intestinal complications was 5837 rad (SE +/- 103) and 6810 rad (SE +/- 236), respectively, with a P value of 0.001. No correlation was found between the dose to Point A and locoregional recurrences.\r"

Creation of a cavity to receive the transplant and the use of two surgical teams and the surgical microscope during the operation ensured its successful outcome. The transplanted ovary was followed up clinically and by ultrasound monitoring: ovarian cycles remained regular despite radiotherapy, and follicle growth occurred normally. In comparison to other types of oophoropexy described in the literature, the advantages of this technique included total protection of the ovary from irradiation, and conservation of ovarian function and fertility. One year after the procedure, puncture of the ovarian compartment produced a mature oocyte specimen.\r"

CTX yields of 23.5 +/- 21.5 U/ml, 15 +/- 18 U/ml, and 12.1 +/- 12.1 U/ml were obtained in response to PHA, PMA, and Sendai virus, respectively, as compared with corresponding yields of 207.3 +/- 93.1, 154 +/- 37.4, and 205.2 +/- 62.4 in healthy controls. The extent of reduced production of CTXs appeared to be correlated with the severity of the disease. Systemic interferon (IFN) administered to four patients caused CTX production to improve in response to PHA (147.5 +/- 55.1 U/ml compared with pretreatment values of 14.1 +/- 6 U/ml, P less than 0.05). However, CTX production in response to Sendai virus remained low. The extent to which CTX production by hairy cell leukemia mononuclear cells was reduced was proportionate to the observed decrease in monocyte counts. However, the degree to which CTX production improved after IFN treatment was significantly greater than the observed increase in monocyte counts. The major CTX induced by PHA in mononuclear cells of healthy donors and of IFN-treated HCL patients was identified as tumor necrosis factor-alpha.\r"

The histologic and histochemical data on gastric mucosa surrounding the carcinoma have been compared with data from 60 biopsy samples taken from gastric stumps without carcinoma in an age-and sex-matched group. There was a high incidence of intestinal metaplasia in the gastric stumps (24 of 60); it was even higher in the cases with a carcinoma (17 of 18). Intestinal metaplasia Type III, which is closely related to the carcinoma in a stomach not surgically treated, was rare in cases of cancer in the gastric stump (1 in 18). This finding is correlated to the high frequency of the diffuse type of carcinomas that occur in the gastric stump (15 of 20), which are rarely associated with intestinal metaplasia. Therefore, identifying intestinal metaplasia types does not always point to the fact that affected patients will also be at high risk for cancer in their gastric remnant.\r"

This study investigates whether serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement in patients with cold thyroid nodule and metastases from an unknown primary site could help identify a differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The results obtained show that Tg measurements is a useful adjunctive test when used with fine-needle aspiration biopsy. In particular, very high Tg levels point to metastatic thyroid cancer, whereas lower levels do not help determining whether metastatic cancer is of thyroid origin or not.\r"

Ninety-two cases of breast cancer, six benign mammary disease, and three normal breast tissues were studied for ER, PR, and ODC. Prolactinemia was assessed in 59 cancer patients, 14 of whom showed hyper-Prl along with significantly higher ODC than in patients with normal-Prl [(20.01 +/- 6.33) 10(-2) vs (5.20 +/- 0.90) 10(-2) pmol CO2/micrograms protein/h; P less than 0.0125]. A direct correlation was found between Prl and ODC in postmenopausal women (n = 40). Prl was assayed in seven of 13 ER-PR breast cancer patients; a highly significant, direct correlation was found between Prl and ODC in this group (r = 0.934, P less than 0.0025). ODC did not correlate with ER or PR. Carcinomas with higher ODC (n = 17) had higher cellularity, lower histologic differentiation, and higher nuclear anaplasia than those in which ODC was not detectable (n = 13). In normal breast and five of six benign mammary disease tissues, ODC was not detectable. These findings suggest that ODC could be a reliable marker for prognosis.\r"

These patients often require frequent nutritional as well as surgical or medical intervention. Attempts were made to identify, evaluate, and compensate for numerous confounding variables at each of the 374 plasma selenium determinations. Selenium levels in stable patients who were neither receiving aggressive antineoplastic therapy, nor septic, nor taking corticosteroids and who had no clinically significant metabolic imbalance were then separately analyzed. In 55 stable patients selenium levels were 28% lower than those found in 20 normal controls (mean 61.8 micrograms/L, P less than 0.0005). An analysis of all the readings showed that selenium levels were substantially decreased by recent radiotherapy or sepsis, by regional tumor spread and increased tumor burden, and by intravenous and/or enteral hyperalimentation and intravenous lipids. In contrast to these findings, levels were relatively higher in patients with an adequate oral diet or with a lesser tumor burden. The comparison between selenium levels in stable and in aggressively treated or septic patients supports the importance of the relationship of nutrition to selenium levels in cancer patients.\r"

Immunopathologic studies of all cases using S-100 protein and desmin, and electron microscopy in four cases, were unsuccessful in distinguishing between the two subtypes. Clinical behavior was aggressive regardless of histologic subtype. Extensive surgical treatment when the diagnosis is made is advocated. The combination of the rarity and the subtle histologic features of desmoplastic melanoma continues to make the correct diagnosis of this entity a challenge for the clinician and pathologist.\r"

  ".W": "In a series of 641 patients with small cell lung cancer, 189 (29.5%) had at least one neurologic disorder either at the time of presentation or during the subsequent clinical course of the cancer. The total number of neurologic disorders was 210, which included brain metastases (75.7%), meningeal carcinomatosis (6.7%), intramedullary metastases (2.4%), epidural metastases (11.0%), hyponatremia producing CNS symptoms (3.3%), and Eaton-Lambert syndrome (1.0%). The most common signs and symptoms were motor dysfunction and confusion. The overall survival of patients with any neurologic disorder was compared to that of patients without neurologic problems. There was no difference between the survival curves for the first year and a half, but patients without neurologic complications had a greater probability of long-term survival (log-rank P = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences when this comparison was made according to stage of disease. When a neurologic disorder related to cancer occurred, the survival time from the date of that diagnosis was usually short. The neurologic disorder was the immediate cause of death in the majority of cases. In patients who achieved a complete remission, the administration of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) significantly reduced the risk of developing brain metastases as the initial site of the relapse (log-rank P = 0.0034). After adjustment for performance status and extent of disease, the survival of complete responders treated with and without PCI was not significantly different. We conclude that neurologic complications are a frequent and serious problem in patients with SCLC.\r"

Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) was the most common histologic subtype (97% of cases). Patients were randomly assigned to receive various therapeutic regimens according to IRS protocols. Among 81 patients (85%) with localized disease, most (57) were in Clinical Group I (localized, completely excised tumors), and 20 were in Group II (gross excision with tumor-involved, regional retroperitoneal lymph nodes or microscopic residual). Only four were in Group III (gross residual disease in the primary site or retroperitoneal lymph nodes). Three of them achieved a complete response (CR) after induction therapy and two then relapsed. The relapse-free survival (RFS) estimates at 3 years from diagnosis were 93% in Group I and 90% in Group II. Distant metastases were present at diagnosis in only 14 patients. Twelve of them achieved CR, but four subsequently relapsed; their 3-year RFS estimate was 67%. Overall, survival rates among the 95 children were excellent (89% at 3 years) compared to the entire IRS series (63%). Treatment with radical orchidectomy and chemotherapy was sufficient for Group I patients. Orchidectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy were highly effective in Group II patients and in a large proportion of those with more advanced tumors. Recommendations for the diagnostic examinations and management of future patients with paratesticular sarcoma are given.\r"

This procedure produced evidence that the scapegoat had a significant protective effect: children were twice as likely to eat some portion of their test meal at the time of assessment if they had received the scapegoat at conditioning than when there was no intervention. Thus, the consumption of strongly flavored candies before chemotherapy appears to be a simple and effective way to reduce the impact of chemotherapy on preference for normal menu items.\r"

The eight teams assigned to the hematology/oncology unit (HO teams) saw significantly more cancer patients than did the six teams assigned to general medicine floors (GM teams). Patients seen by HO teams were sicker (P less than 0.001). Hematology/oncology teams engaged in fewer support behaviors, particularly with the sickest cancer patients, than did the GM teams. Teams did not differ on time spent with patient or patient involvement but HO teams were rated significantly lower on addressing the patient's needs. The authors propose the concentration of sick cancer patients on a designated cancer unit diminishes house staff ability to engage in supportive behaviors and to address the needs of patients during morning rounds.\r"

A significant increased risk for colon cancer was observed among first-degree relatives of colon cancer patients when compared to controls. When the patient sample was divided into two groups based on country and continent of birth--European (Ashkenazim) and other (nonAshkenazim)--the relatives of the nonAshkenazi subjects showed a greater relative risk for colon cancer (P less than 0.05). Colon cancer was found to be less frequent in nonAshkenazim than in Ashkenazim controls. These findings suggest that although the colon cancer frequency in the nonAshkenazi group is lower, the genetic component may be more important than for the Ashkenazi sample. The nonAshkenazi Jews may represent distinct subgroups that differ with respect to either primary genetic susceptibility to colorectal cancer and/or they may have been subjected to peculiar, environmental carcinogenic exposures when compared to their Ashkenazim brethren.\r"

All had painful limitation of motion of the hip that prevented proper positioning of the femoral head using a brace. The average age when the patients were first seen was eight years and six months. General anesthesia was required in order to obtain the reduction, and percutaneous tenotomy of the adductor longus was done whenever necessary. After the reduction, a Petrie cast was worn for several months. The length of follow-up averaged three years and eight months (range, two years to six years and eight months). Radiographic evaluation at the time of the last follow-up showed nine hips to be spherically congruent, twelve to be spherically congruent, and one to be incongruent. Thus, in 95 per cent of the hips, a congruent joint was obtained using this method of treatment. These results strongly support the concept that all treatment should be directed at containing the femoral head within the acetabulum during the clinically active phase of coxa plana.\r"

A technical error had been made in sixteen of the patients, and ten of the errors were associated with the ultimate failure of the original unicondylar procedure. Ninety-three per cent of the failed unicompartmental arthroplasties were revised using a posterior cruciate-sparing total knee replacement. Bone grafts, augmentation with screws and cement, a long-stem component, or a combination of these were used in half of the patients. The average follow-up after the revision arthroplasty was 4.6 years.\r"

The rate of mortality one year after the fracture was 21.6 per cent for the total group, 8.0 per cent for the low-risk group, and 49.4 per cent for the high-risk group. The standard mortality ratio was six times higher for the high-risk group than for the general population (individuals who did not have a fracture), matched for age. It was highest for patients who were less than seventy years old and lowest for those who were older than eighty. However, in the second year after the fracture, the standard mortality ratio approached unity--that is, the rate of mortality approached that of the general population. The results suggest that there is an inverse relationship between mortality and advanced age and that the impact of a fracture of the hip on mortality is seen primarily in the first year after injury.\r"

Preoperatively, we studied three distinct populations of patients. Group I consisted of sixteen patients who were scheduled to have a unilateral total knee replacement and who had no signs or symptoms of arthritis in the contralateral knee. Group II consisted of twelve patients who were scheduled to have a unilateral total knee replacement but who had asymptomatic degenerative arthritis in the contralateral knee. Group III consisted of seven patients who had bilateral arthritis that was to be managed by total knee replacement. The gait mat allowed us to measure stance time, step length, double-support time, swing time, swing-to-stance ratio, and velocity. A knee-rating scale was used to measure pain. The data were compared with those obtained from an age-matched control group of ninety-one subjects. Postoperatively, the gait evaluation revealed marked improvement in all of the patients. However, the patients in Group II did not improve as much as those in Groups I and III did. We concluded that even asymptomatic arthritis can impair gait, that bilateral total knee replacement can yield excellent results, and that patients tend to use the lower limbs in as symmetrical a way as possible. Gait analysis can be an important source of objective information, and it is easily performed by using a gait mat.\r"

Nineteen (90 per cent) of the twenty-one patients who were treated without repair of the deltoid ligament had a good or excellent result. All but two of these patients were unrestricted in the ability to walk and run and had no pain during the activities of daily living. No patient had instability of the ankle. At follow-up, the range of motion of the ankle was within 15 degrees of that of the uninjured ankle in 90 per cent of the patients. Only one ankle had radiographic evidence of narrowing of the joint space. The three patients in whom the deltoid ligament was repaired did not have as good a result as the twenty-one patients in whom it was not, but this group was too small to permit valid comparisons. We concluded that exploration of the medial side of the ankle and repair of the deltoid ligament are not necessary unless reduction of the lateral malleolus fails to reduce the talus within the ankle mortise.\r"

Bone scans indicated that the osteonecrosis was due to osseous ischemia that occurred two to twelve months before the pathological fracture. Fracture-healing was prolonged, taking as long as two years for completion in some patients. Inadequate periods of immobilization and early weight-bearing led to malunion.\r"

This approach provided anterior access to the neural elements from the clivus to the body of the third cervical vertebra, without the need for posterior dissection of the carotid sheath or entrance into the hypopharynx or oral cavity. It also provided adequate exposure for the insertion of iliac or fibular strut grafts, which was necessary in thirteen patients. The approach gave excellent exposure for anterior intralesional excision of a tumor in ten patients, marginal excision of an osteochondroma, two corpectomies of the second cervical vertebra combined with removal of the odontoid process, corpectomy of the second cervical vertebra for the treatment of fixed atlanto-axial subluxation, removal of a bullet anterior to the clivus, reduction of a dislocation of the second on the third cervical vertebra secondary to an unstable fracture of the pedicles of the second cervical vertebra, and anterior debridement for treatment of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. In contrast to the reported results of transmucosal approaches to the atlas and axis, there were no infections or iatrogenic neurological deficits of the spine in the present series. Twelve patients who were followed for two years or more had a solid anterior fusion and no subsequent loss of cervical stability. Pain in the neck was relieved in all of the patients who had had a pathological or traumatic fracture.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable interest has developed in the role of the autonomic nervous system and its effect on blood flow in bone. Theories pertaining to the long-term physiological effect of sympathectomy on blood flow in bone have been controversial. This study employed the radioactive tracer-microsphere technique to investigate the influence of sympathectomy on regional blood flow in bone over time in dogs. Blood flow was measured in fifteen adult dogs, weighing eighteen to twenty kilograms, at one hour, one day, and one, two, three, four, and six weeks after a transperitoneal sympathectomy from the first to the sixth lumbar level. Absolute control flow values were consistent with those that have been reported previously and had lower standard errors. Blood flow in bone in the femoral regions increased by 24.0 to 41.0 per cent. Greater elevations, of 37.0 to 59.0 per cent, were noted in the tibial sections. The largest increases (58.0 to 67.0 per cent) were seen in the metatarsals and proximal phalanges. All elevated values for blood flow returned to control values by six weeks. The data support the hypothesis that surgical sympathectomy exerts a significant yet transient effect on blood flow in bone. Furthermore, the greater increase distally is the first physiological evidence to support previous anatomical work that concluded that the major site of sympathetic tone lies distally in the lower extremity of the dog.\r"

In all patients, the fracture of the femur was five centimeters or less from the more proximal of the two distal screw-holes. Finite-element analysis revealed that the stress on the nail exceeded its fatigue endurance limit and that the femur had to regain 50 per cent of its original stiffness through healing to accommodate weight-bearing without the risk of fatigue failure of the nail. The risk of fatigue failure may be minimized by using nails that have a larger diameter and by avoiding early weight-bearing.\r"

  ".U": "88153794\r", 
  ".W": "The cellular basis of contracture of the palmar fascia in patients who have Dupuytren disease involves the generation of intracellular force and the transmission of this force to the surrounding tissue. A specialized cell, the myofibroblast, supposedly generates this intracellular force. Recently published studies from our laboratory demonstrated that the cytoskeleton of the myofibroblast contains non-muscle myosin and not smooth-muscle myosin, suggesting that it utilizes a non-muscle contractile system. In addition, these studies identified the extracellular glycoprotein fibronectin, not the basal-lamina-specific glycoprotein laminin, at the surface of myofibroblasts, suggesting that the transmission of the intracellular force to the surrounding tissue also occurs by a non-muscle mechanism. Because of the lack of proteins that are specific to smooth muscle in the specialized cell in Dupuytren disease, we prefer the term specialized contractile fibroblast to describe this type of cell. To determine the mechanism by which the intracellular force may be transmitted to the surrounding tissue, we examined the ultrastructure of the connection of the cytoskeleton of the specialized contractile fibroblast to the surrounding extracellular matrix. By electron microscopy, extracellular filamentous material was identified at the surface of the specialized contractile fibroblast. These extracellular fibrils were found to be in close association with intracellular bundles of actin microfilaments, resulting in specialized transmembranous associations at the surface of the specialized contractile fibroblast. Bundles of filamentous extracellular material were found to extend from the surface of the specialized contractile fibroblast, connecting it with the surrounding matrix and also with adjacent specialized contractile fibroblasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Seven different types of intercarpal arthrodeses that are commonly used in clinical practice were simulated in wrists of cadavera by drilling two nonparallel Kirschner wires across the involved joint that was to be fused. The changes in radial deviation, ulnar deviation, dorsiflexion, and palmar flexion, and the arc of motion in two planes (radial plus ulnar deviation and dorsiflexion plus palmar flexion) were compared with control values for each specimen and with each of the other arthrodeses. All of the data were analyzed by calculating the mean and standard error of the changes in these motions of the wrist as compared with the control values for each wrist. The statistical significance of the changes was derived by the t test. For values of t greater than 2.262, the observed mean reductions in the motions were statistically significant (p = 0.05) in all wrists except those that had simulated arthrodesis of the lunate-triquetrum or the capitate-hamate joint. No statistically significant differences were noted between the effects of arthrodesis of the scaphoid-trapezium-trapezoid, scaphoid-capitate, and scaphoid-lunate joints on the motions of the wrist. All arthrodeses except those of the lunate-triquetrum and the capitate-hamate joint produced a statistically significant decrease in the total arc of motion; arthrodesis of the capitate-lunate joint produced the most statistically significant decrease in total arc of motion. In our opinion, the results of the study suggest that there is limited justification for arthrodesis of the capitate-hamate joint.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three (17 per cent) of the patients had a non-union, and two of them had a poor clinical result. These two patients had had a unilateral comminuted fracture--that is, one fracture that was anterior and one that was posterior to the lateral mass, with an associated osteoperiosteal avulsion of the transverse ligament on the same side of the ring of the atlas. Six (33 per cent) of the eighteen patients had an osteoperiosteal avulsion of the transverse ligament. The avulsions usually progressed to osseous union. Rupture of the mid-substance of the transverse ligament was uncommon.

Traction pins that were placed obliquely were associated with a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) and predictable difference in the intercondylar angle (axis of the knee joint) as compared with pins that were placed horizontally. The study showed that pins for skeletal traction should be placed parallel to the axis of the knee joint and that fractures in children who are more than eleven years old should be reduced without overriding.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively studied 56 consecutive patients with severe tricyclic antidepressant ingestion to determine the incidence of associated pulmonary complications. Among the patients meeting the entrance criteria, the mean antidepressant level was 1136 ng/ml. Other characteristics were a QRS duration of greater than or equal to 0.1 seconds in 35 (63%) and seizures in 19 (34%). Seventeen patients (30%) developed 18 abnormal chest X-ray findings which included pulmonary edema in 8 cases and aspiration pneumonia in 10. Using logistic regression, we evaluated the influence of tricyclic antidepressant level, blood pressure, QRS interval, seizures, drug co-ingestion and the use of gastric lavage vs. ipecac-induced emesis on pulmonary complications. For patients with pulmonary edema, the only significantly associated factor was hypotension on emergency department presentation. For aspiration pneumonia, no significant associations were found. Co-ingestion of another drug had no apparent influence on the development of pulmonary abnormalities. Our findings suggest that pulmonary edema and aspiration pneumonia are frequent complications of severe ingestions of tricyclic antidepressants. Pulmonary edema appears to result from hypotension or its treatment. The etiology of aspiration pneumonia is unclear. A chest X-ray should be obtained in all victims of tricyclic antidepressant overdose.\r"

It has a remarkable specificity for the adrenal cortex and can produce necrosis of that organ; consequently, it has been used as a therapeutic agent for adrenocortical carcinoma. Because of the similarity between adrenocortical and testicular tissue, mitotane could be expected to cause testicular damage; however, there is sparse support for this in the literature. We recently studied a patient who developed impotency due to primary testicular failure at the time that he was treated with mitotane. A testicular biopsy, performed about four months after the drug was discontinued, showed normal appearing Leydig cells and atrophy of the seminiferous tubules with the picture of a maturation arrest. In the four and one half years since he last received mitotane, the patient's libido has slowly improved and his plasma testosterone, gonadotropins and LH response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone have become essentially normal. We propose that mitotane can be cytotoxic to the testis as it is to the adrenal cortex.\r"

We prospectively studied 121 children treated at home by a regional poison center to determine if a relationship existed between fluid volume and time to emesis. These children were treated in the usual manner except that parents were asked to measure the volume of fluid given and to note the time that fluid was given and the time of first emesis. The time ranged from 6 to 58 minutes (mean 20.6) with two who failed to respond and the volume ranged from 0 to 28 ounces (mean 6.7 ounces). In children who respond to ipecac, there is no significant relationship between the amount of fluid given and the time until emesis. We conclude that the traditional recommendation of forcing fluid with syrup of ipecac does not hasten emesis in children.\r"

Twenty female subjects immersed their hands in a standardized slurry of green chile for 40 minutes, afterwards one hand was placed in cool tap water and the other in vegetable oil for a total of 75 minutes. Pain was scored using a visual analog scale while the hands were immersed in the chile slurry, test baths, and after drying. The difference in pain score was calculated for each subject. Analysis was by pooled regression. Cool tap water immersion initially provided more relief while vegetable oil provided better long-term relief from the pain of \"chile burns\".\r"

  ".W": "The rate of detection of phencyclidine during toxicology testing of a university medical center patient population was studied by retrospective review of the results of 6,870 toxicology panels performed on urine during the period September 1, 1984 to September 1, 1987. The rate was compared with that noted in earlier studies of drug detection at this institution. For the three-year period, 91 panels (1.3%) involving 82 individuals were positive for phencyclidine: men, 49 cases; women, 15 cases; children, 10 cases; and neonates, 8 cases. The typical user was a 25 year old Hispanic or Black man who had ingested phencyclidine alone or in combination with at least one other drug (usually ethanol or cocaine) and who had been admitted to the trauma service. Despite use of the same analytical methodology and increased ordering of toxicology tests during the study period, the frequency of phencyclidine detection decreased during each year of the study (1984-85, 2.3% of 1,280 panels; 1985-86, 1.5% of 1,956 panels; and 1986-87, 0.9% of 3,634 panels). These figures are substantially lower than the 5% rate noted in our study of emergency room patients in 1979. These data suggest that the use of phencyclidine may be decreasing, possibly due to increase in abuse of other drugs such as cocaine and the amphetamines and to the more stringent restrictions placed upon phencyclidine synthesis. About half of the phencyclidine-positive findings occurred in trauma patients, suggesting the particular importance of searching for the drug in this population.\r"

If these factors are not present and preserved, they must be reconstructed.

One group is for the glenohumeral joint: the deltoid, latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major, and the rotator cuff muscles--especially the subscapularis muscle for internal rotation and the infraspinatus and the teres minor muscles for external rotation. The second group, the trapezius, rhomboids, and serratus anterior muscles, is strengthened for scapular control. Finally, general conditioning and trunk flexibility exercises are critical for a return to former competitive levels.\r"

The central portion of the disc (nucleus pulposus) moves posteriorly and oppositely to the FEM prediction. The anterior and posterior portions of the disc agree more closely with the FEM than the central portions of the disc. In general, the FEM predicts much more accurately the up-down displacement components than it does the anterior-posterior components. The measured displacements provide a new class of information concerning the function of the interior of the disc, and also provide a new basis for validation of FEMs that attempt to mimic real intervertebral disc behavior. Implications for understanding of disc function and pathology are discussed.\r"

These maneuvers are poor discriminators of trunk muscle strength, and they lack the range of resistance necessary to cover the spectrum of human trunk muscle strength capability. Use of manually handled weights can improve the above clinical tests and resistive exercise methods. As a result of selective positioning of the weights, variable resistance above and below that provided by the body segments alone can be achieved. The partial sit-up may be appropriate only for patients with significant trunk flexion weakness, and the straight head-trunk sit-up may be useful as a more strenuous test and resistive exercise. Rationale and derivations of the rigid-body equilibrium equations, as well as some of the limitations and assumptions associated with the modeling approach, are presented.\r"

Exertions were made in flexion, extension, and left and right lateral bending. Three heavy-lifting tasks also were studied. A biomechanical model was used to predict the forces in the trunk muscles, and the predictions then were compared to the measurements. The abdominal muscles were all active in attempted flexion, while the erector spinae muscles were inactive. In attempted extension, the erectors were maximally active, but considerable activity was present in the abdominal muscles as well. The highest activity levels recorded in the oblique abdominal muscles were in lateral bending. There were high degrees of correlation between the measured muscle activities and predicted muscle tensions for the erector spinae and rectus abdominus muscles, while the correlation coefficients for the oblique abdominal muscles were lower (0.4-0.7). The study indicates that inclusion of antagonistic activity is an important consideration to improve model predictions. The oblique abdominal muscles appear to be more active, in general, than predicted. For the longitudinal trunk muscles, the predictions are excellent throughout.\r"

  ".W": "The myoelectric activity of selected trunk muscles was recorded during the development of controlled isometric axial torques. Muscle activity was measured bilaterally over the erector spinae, the rectus abdominus, the oblique external and the oblique internal abdominal muscles at the L3 level. Subjects first applied graded isometric torque efforts over a 10 second ramp up to maximum voluntary contraction with the trunk in neutral rotation. They then repeated the effort with the trunk twisted to the left and right. The largest electromyographic activities were found in the agonistic oblique muscles, but considerable antagonistic activity was present also. While the activity of the internal oblique and rectus were bilaterally similar in symmetric standing a difference occurred between the two sides when the trunk was twisted to the right or left. Axial prerotation of the trunk by 30 degrees in the direction of torque development marginally decreased the maximal developed torque, whereas prerotation in the opposite direction increased the developed torque.\r"

  ".W": "A canine in vivo model of midcervical ligamentous instability was developed by dividing the anterior longitudinal ligament, anulus fibrosus, and all posterior ligamentous structures including the ligamentum flavum. The natural history of healing in the model, the effect on its healing by an adjacent one-level arthrodesis, and the effect of a one-level arthrodesis on normal adjacent ligamentous structures were studied radiographically, mechanically, and histologically. The authors determined that healing takes place primarily by anterior scar formation in their instability model but not to a degree sufficient to recreate normal mechanical stability. After three months, healing in the model was not affected by an adjacent arthrodesis; however, acutely, instability apparently was increased as three animals became quadriplegic between the second and fourth postoperative days. Arthrodesis did not affect adjacent normal ligamentous structures, during this period. Incomplete healing in the authors' model supports those who advocate arthrodesis as the treatment of choice for destabilizing cervical ligamentous injury. The authors previously reported the case of a patient who sustained bilateral facet dislocations adjacent to an arthrodesed segment and questioned whether this resulted from a stress-concentrating effect. This study indicates that this could well have been the case acutely. Thus, inadvertent exclusion of an unstable segment from an arthrodesis has potentially catastrophic results. Finally, the authors also have previously questioned whether arthrodesis of a midcervical segment could lead to instability of adjacent normal segments. This project does not support such a concern, at least for the three postoperative months of study.\r"

Intradural intersegmental connections between sensory rootlets occur frequently in the cervical region and have been shown to be clinically and surgically significant. Similar connections between motor rootlets also have been noticed, but their incidence was not reported. Fifty-four human cervical spines were dissected to investigate the incidence of both types of connections. Fifty-three of the 54 specimens had posterior rootlet connections, and nine of the 54 had anterior connections. The preponderant pattern (85%) was for a peripheral dorsal or ventral rootlet to join the central portion of the next rostral or caudal root, and for the two to pass together into the spinal cord. Six distinct patterns were recognized, and a classification system is proposed. These connections may provide a pathway for overlap of sensory dermatomes and motor innervation of the neck and upper extremity. Our observations imply that when a cervical nerve root is injured, small segments of an adjacent root may be equally affected, and the process may be clinically localized one segment higher or lower than it actually is.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen patients whose posterior tibial nerve somatosensory cortical-evoked potentials (SCEPs) were monitored for spinal surgery, underwent sequential recordings at different stimulus rates (6.1, 5.1, 4.1, 3.1, 2.1, and 1.1 Hz), after induction of anesthesia and patient positioning but before the incision was made. A markedly detrimental influence of higher (5.1 and 6.1 Hz), yet commonly used, stimulus rates on the amplitude of the evoked potential waveform was noticed. This tendency was most pronounced in patients with an antecedent spinal cord injury. In three patients with severe incomplete cord injuries, the amplitude of the cortical-evoked potential was sufficiently attenuated to preclude reliable intraoperative monitoring when stimulus rates of 5.1 Hz and greater were used. By contrast, evoked potentials could be monitored reliably in all patients when stimulus rates of 1.1 or 2.1 Hz were used. Six of seven patients (87%) whose evoked response amplitude showed a major reduction with higher stimulus frequencies had either a discrete sensory level or bilateral lower extremity weakness or both. Only two of seven patients (29%) whose evoked potential remained minimally affected by the stimulus rate had similar neurologic impairment. The authors conclude that, particularly in the setting of severe incomplete spinal cord injuries, the higher rates of stimulus presentation commonly used may result in failure to obtain waveforms that are adequate for intraoperative SCEP monitoring. The use of unconventionally low stimulus rates may greatly facilitate SCEP monitoring in such situations.\r"

Groups of male and female rats, with initial ages of 3, 6, or 24 weeks, were held for five weeks in restraints that laterally deformed their trunks. In response to these deforming moments, the spine of every animal studied acquired an at-least-temporarily fixed lateral curve. Without exception, when deforming moments were applied, the rats' spines deformed. Neither age nor sex was an important factor in this response. The implications of these results to possible mechanisms of scoliosis curve progression in humans are discussed.\r"

This finding, if confirmed with larger populations, could lead to a prognostic test for the determination of therapeutic modality. Platelet aggregation was found to be lower than in a group of controls; however, similar findings were also obtained from a group of patients with chronic orthopaedic conditions. Mitral valve prolapse, the electroencephalogram and the mother's age at patient's birth were all found to be nonspecific for the patients as compared to control groups.

The records and roentgenograms of 24 cervical spine dislocations were reviewed retrospectively. Evaluation of cervical distraction vs traction weight indicates that Ftraction = kneck delta x; where F = traction weight and x = distraction at the injured level. The constant, kneck, is different for bilateral and unilateral dislocations (P less than .001) and is a function of magnitude of injury and neck morphology. As determined in this study, traction weight needed for reduction of facet dislocations may be estimated using the formulae: Ftx = 107.1 lbs/cm (x) unilateral, and Ftx = 76.4 lbs/cm (x) bilateral.\r"

Because of frequent inequality in the size of the two vertebral arteries, damage to the larger artery may lead to ischemia of the brain stem. Vertebral artery obstruction may be produced by extension with rotation, even within normal ranges of motion. Neurologic injury following manipulation requires accurate diagnosis and prompt manipulation requires accurate diagnosis and prompt anticoagulant therapy.\r"

Thirty-one benign and 51 malignant tumors were identified. The mean follow-up in benign lesions was 9.7 years and 3.8 years in malignant lesions. Plain roentgenograms demonstrated the spinal lesion in 81 of 82 cases (99%). All spinal segments were involved, the cervical spine least frequently. Malignancy proved to be associated with an older age at diagnosis, a higher incidence of neurologic deficit, and a higher incidence of occurrence in the vertebral body. Five-year survival for patients with benign tumors was 86%, with no significant relationship between type of surgery and survival. Five-year survival in malignant lesions did correlate with the extent of initial surgery and with the tumor type. Five-year survival in patients undergoing curettage for malignancy was nil, in those undergoing incomplete resection, 18.7%, and in patients having complete excision, 75%. Plain anteroposterior and lateral roentgenograms should be obtained as a screening study in patients with persistent or atypical back pain or neurologic signs. CT scanning, myelography, and magnetic resonance imaging studies may be utilized to establish the physical margins of the lesion and to evaluate cord impingement. Surgical extirpation should be attempted whenever possible in malignant and benign aggressive lesions. In this series, the prolonged survival seen with complete excision justifies an aggressive surgical approach to the treatment of these tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A coupling between the lateral flexion and axial rotation as a result of the geometric arrangement of the motion segments is well known in a normal spine. The kinematic behavior of idiopathic scoliotic spines has been analyzed by means of a biomechanical model study and a radiologic study. The anteroposterior and lateral flexion radiographs of 40 patients with progressive adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were studied. In five of these patients, anteroposterior radiographs were also made with the spine in a ventrally flexed position. The kinematic behavior of a nonpathologic spine was examined by means of a three-dimensional, nonlinear geometric mathematical model of the spine. The frontal plane inclination of the facet joints in conjunction with the vertebral orientation in the sagittal plane influence the kinematic behavior in the normal spine. In a scoliotic spine, there is an axially rotated position and, in most cases, a dorsal inclination (lordotic) of the motion segments. Nevertheless, the direction of the axial rotation during lateral flexion does not differ from the direction of the axial rotation during lateral flexion in a normal spine. The existing axial rotation in idiopathic scoliosis cannot be explained on the basis of spinal kinematics. In contrast to normal spines, in scoliotic spines exists a coupling between ventral flexion or extension and axial rotation. This may be essential in the management of idiopathic scoliosis.\r"

The axial and torsional stiffness coefficients of each system were determined on a customized geometric spine simulator fashioned from stainless steel. The relative stability of each instrumentation system was then compared by mounting the fixation systems on bovine thoracic spines from 12-week-old calves, destabilized by anterior vertebrectomy to create simulated two column instability. Thirteen spines were tested. Each specimen was tested under axial and torsional loading conditions while monitoring with a personal computer-based data acquisition system was performed. The stability of first- and second-level CD instrumentation was tested on the bovine specimens. First-level CD instrumentation involved double-hook fixation one level above and below the level of instability. Second-level CD instrumentation involved fixation two levels above and below the level of instability without fixation at the intermediate level. In axial loading, double-level wired Harrington distraction rods, double-level wired Luque rods, and first-level CD rods were 26.5%, 18.4%, and 21.5%, respectively, as stable as second-level CD instrumentation. In torsion, double-level Harrington, double-level Luque, and second-level CD rods were 13%, 64%, and 34%, respectively, as stable as first level CD instrumentation. Locking hooks, double-hook configurations, and stabilizing transverse traction devices of the CD contributed to its greater stability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The \"fixateur interne\" is a new device for posterior spine surgery. It consists of long Schanz screws which are inserted from a posterior approach through the pedicles into the vertebral bodies, and of connecting threaded longitudinal rods, carrying mobile clamps which can be fixed in every position by nuts. The long leverarms of the Schanz screws facilitate manual reduction. They are removed at the end of operation. As the device is stable against flexion and rotation by itself, it does not act on the four-point bending principle. Thus, the fixation can be restricted to the immediately adjacent vertebrae of a lesion, leaving the rest of the spine mobile. In fracture treatment instrumentation is combined with a direct repair of the anterior loss of bone stock by a transpedicular bone grafting procedure from the same dorsal approach. This report presents and discusses 183 instrumentations in fresh fractures, posttraumatic deformities, degenerative diseases, tumors, and severe spondylolistheses. The main advantage is the short fixation area and the ease of after treatment.\r"

If that same impaired development also affected the immune and central nervous systems, there could be a relationship between the vertebral canal size, health, and academic status. A retrospective analysis was made of the general practitioner records of 94 patients, some with very narrow canals and some with wide canals. There were significantly more episodes and total attendances with infections, more episodes of low-back pain, and more attendances with trauma in those with small canals. A prospective study compared the GCE examination results of 331 children whose canals had been measured by ultrasound 3 years previously. The children in the highest three deciles for canal size performed significantly better than those in the lowest decile (P less than 0.01). There is evidence that a relation may exist between the sagittal diameter of the lumbar vertebral canal and health and academic status.\r"

To elucidate the possible mechanisms, 11 patients with acute low back pain were studied over 12 months and compared with controls. The patients showed prolongation of the euglobulin lysis time throughout the study; the fibrin plate lysis area was initially normal but became abnormal within 2 weeks. In five patients, the symptoms resolved and the initial fibrinolytic defect improved. In contrast, the fibrinolytic defect remained in six patients with persistent pain. These results suggest that the fibrinolytic defect is secondary to mechanical damage but, if persistent, may become a secondary pathogenic factor associated with the chronicity of some back pain problems.\r"

In the thoracolumbar or lumbar spine however, the criteria are much less strict for the application of this eponym. A retrospective review of all the cases of lumbar Scheuermann's disease seen at the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital revealed two distinct radiographic pictures. These consisted of a \"classic\" Scheuermann's and an \"atypical\" type characterized by vertebral end plate changes, disc space narrowing, and anterior Schmorl's nodes, but not otherwise fulfilling Sorenson's criteria. This group tended to occur in more athletic adolescents or those with a history of increased axial stress to the spine. A subgrouping of atypical Scheuermann's disease is proposed and includes acute traumatic intraosseous disc herniation. Based on these findings, a classification of lumbar Scheuermann's disease is proposed.\r"

The best result was achieved if the patient was operated on before 2 months' duration of disabling sciatica. The operative finding graded as protrusion predicted poor result. The social and psychological factors influenced the outcome more than the findings in the preoperative physical examination or the grade of operative finding. It is recommended to add indices for pain and ADL and a psychological test to the preoperative examinations of patients with lumbar disc herniation.\r"

The impaired capacity of the intestine to transport glucose in vivo could be partially restored to normal by administration of the mineralacorticoid deoxycorticosterone acetate, infusion with normal saline or the administration of insulin. The influences of alterations in mineral and glucose metabolism were confirmed by demonstrating an impairment of transport capacity in vivo in uninjured and adrenalectomized, or alloxan diabetic rats.\r"

It has been demonstrated that the levels of vasopressin, a potent natural constrictor of blood vessels, increase four- to six-fold immediately after thermal trauma. Therefore, this substance could be responsible for post-burn coronary constriction and myocardial depression. This was tested using the dog anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital receiving a 15 per cent total body surface area full thickness flame burn as the experimental model. Cardiac output was measured by the thermal dilution technique. Arterial blood pressure was sensed by a Stathem P-23 transducer. Cardiac force of contraction was measured by a Walton-Brody strain gauge arch sewn on the left ventricle. The results of this study showed a significant decrease in cardiac output, increase in peripheral resistance and decrease in myocardial force of contraction immediately after thermal trauma in untreated animals. The decrease in cardiac output and increase in peripheral resistance remained for the duration of the experimental observations (3 h). The decrease in force of contraction returned to pre-burn levels 1 h post-burn. Pretreatment of the experimental animals with d(CH2)5 Tyr(Me)AVP (SK&F 100273), a vasopressin V-1 receptor blocking agent, prevented the initial decrease in cardiac output, increase in peripheral resistance and decrease in the force of contraction. A correlation plot of peripheral resistance vs. cardiac force of contraction showed a positive correlation between these two variables in the pretreated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A large molecular weight cytotoxin (MW = 253,000 daltons) that exhibited cytotoxicity for human foreskin cells and haemolytic activity against human and rabbit erythrocytes was identified. The cytotoxic activity could be completely neutralized by antiserum formed against the cytotoxin. Further characterization of the molecule by isoelectric focusing revealed that the cytotoxin was composed of at least two toxic factors of smaller molecular weight. Both factors exhibited cytotoxicity to tissue-culture cells; however, one factor lysed rabbit but not human erythrocytes whereas the other factor had the opposite haemolytic pattern. The cytotoxicity of each factor was neutralized by the antiserum formed against the cytotoxin. A cytotoxic factor that exhibited haemolytic activity for rabbit erythrocytes, and that was neutralized by the cytotoxin antiserum, was identified in burn wound extracts of mice infected with Staph. aureus. On the basis of molecular weight and isoelectric focusing data, we conclude that the large molecular weight cytotoxin was composed of an aggregation of alpha-haemolysin and another presently unidentified toxic molecule, possibly delta-toxin. Alpha-haemolysin appears to be produced in vivo during experimental staphylococcal burn wound infection.\r"

The child was left unattended by an adult in 53 per cent of cases and documented abuse was present in 6 per cent. The mean total body surface area (TBSA) burned was 17 per cent, and 77 patients (85 per cent) had additional burns in other areas (arms 34 per cent, legs 31 per cent, chest 29 per cent and face 27 per cent). Palmar burns occurred in 24 hands (19 per cent), dorsal in 41 (33 per cent), while both surfaces were burned in 61 (48 per cent). Joints involved included the MP in 96 (76 per cent), PIP in 87 (69 per cent) and DIP in 80 (63 per cent).

Two-thirds of them suffered from burns of less than 15 per cent of their total body surface area. The mortality rate was 64 per cent. All patients were burned in single-person accidents, most often while sitting alone in their own living room, and smoking materials were involved in 85 per cent of the injuries. Senility, hemiplegia and other neurological diseases with tremor or paresis were frequently present in the victims. Several preventive measures are proposed, including smoking under supervision, use of flame-resistant aprons of adequate size, flame-resistant materials in chairs, etc., and installation of smoke detectors in rooms where patients smoke. A possible relation between the marked incidence of these accidents during weekends or holidays, at a time when staff numbers are reduced in the nursing homes, is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator is a device that can be implanted in patients for treatment of recurrent ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. It was recently approved for clinical use in Canada. The authors describe their experience with 12 patients (mean age 51.3 years) who underwent implantation of a defibrillator. All 12 patients had a history of documented ventricular fibrillation, which was idiopathic in 3 and due to ischemic heart disease in 9. Electrophysiologic testing revealed inducible ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in 8 of the 10 patients tested. An important criterion for selection for implantation was failure of pharmacologic therapy to suppress ventricular arrhythmias induced during electrophysiologic testing. Of the 12 patients, 1 died within 24 hours after implantation. During a mean follow-up period of 15.5 months there were no further deaths. All the surviving patients expressed satisfaction with the device; five of the seven under the age of 60 years have returned to work, and one has returned to school. This initial favourable experience with the automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator suggests that future increases in the availability of the device and improvements in its function will lead to much more widespread use, as the population of patients at risk of sudden cardiac death is large.\r"

This number corresponds to an incidence of 12 cholesteatomas per 100,000 inhabitants a year. A detailed follow-up was possible in 164 ears. The primary operation was performed with an intact canal wall technique (CAT) in 148 ears and a radical operation in 40 ears. A planned second look was performed in 138 of the CAT ears and residual cholesteatoma was found in 41 or 30%, mainly in the epitympanic space. An initially good healing and hearing result was obtained in 71% but in the course of time several ears developed new retractions and a new mastoid cholesteatoma. The number of ears with perfect hearing tended to decrease with time, but about one-third of CAT ears remained intact with good hearing. The CAT technique is preferable in ears with a large mastoid air cell system and when the cholesteatoma is easily accessible by the approach. A planned second look should be performed including ossiculoplasty and obliteration of the antrum. In the remaining cases a radical operation including middle ear reconstruction and obliteration of the mastoid cavity is preferred.\r"

We have attempted to interrupt this gastro-oral pathway by instilling an antiseptic (40% ethanol) into the stomach after surgery. We studied 16 patients who were randomly allocated to an 'alcohol' or control group. Alcohol was administered to 8 patients regularly via the nasogastric tube until the 5th postoperative day. The mouth, tracheostomy site and gastric aspirates were sampled on the 1st, 5th, and 10th days after surgery. No patients had IAGB grown from the mouth before surgery, but after surgery coliforms were prolific in all sites in both patient groups, and the administration of alcohol did not have any noticeable affect. However, even though coliforms were ubiquitous during the recovery period, wound complications were few, and their importance in the pathogenesis of wound sepsis is reconsidered.\r"

Local anaesthesia of the nasal vestibule by infiltrating lignocaine produced a sensation of nasal obstruction in 9 out of 15 subjects (P less than 0.02). The infiltration of normal saline had no such effect. The difference between the effect of the 2 agents on nasal airflow sensation was significant (P less than 0.05).

The proximal margin of the gastric folds in a hiatal hernia pouch provide a fixed, reproducible, anatomic landmark at endoscopy, which designates the junction of the muscular wall of the esophagus and stomach and permits one to predict the expected normal location of the SCMJ. The diagnosis of CLE should be considered at endoscopy when either the SCMJ is located or columnar epithelium is obtained by biopsy at a site greater than 2 cm above the proximal margin of the gastric folds located within a hiatal hernia pouch. This study provides an endoscopic criterion to permit a more accurate diagnosis of CLE in its earliest stages and may permit a better assessment of its prevalence.\r"

In the population sampled, routine duodenal aspiration for G. lamblia in patients not clinically suspected of having this parasitic infection is of very low yield.\r"

This report describes 44 patients tested during proximal gastric vagotomy. Evidence of incomplete vagotomy was found in over 95% at the conclusion of the conventional operation. Importantly, the test was a guide to further operative maneuvers which abolished the evidence of incomplete vagotomy upon subsequent testing. The endoscopic Congo red test satisfies the requirements for an ideal test for complete vagotomy: it is easily performed, does not require special equipment, and can be repeated several times if necessary to verify that desired effects have been achieved. The wider use of this test, therefore, appears justified.\r"

To best evaluate the newly available Renaflo hemofilter, we studied the effect of increasing filtration rates on the SC of a sample MMW substance (inulin). An in-vitro filtration system was designed to deliver varying Qf from 4.1 to 17.7 ml/min. Serum and filtrate chemistries (urea, creatinine, total protein) were determined. The results revealed no change in sieving for urea or creatinine and a universally low sieving for protein. The sieving coefficient for inulin, however, decreased significantly; from 0.93 at a Qf of 4.1 ml/min to 0.79 at a Qf of 17.7 ml/min (p less than 0.03). These results confirm that the SC of MMW substances do decrease as Qf increase. Despite the decrease found, when compared to previously published data, the Renaflo hemofilter seems to offer a greater degree of middle molecular weight sieving under conditions encountered during CAVH.\r"

Blood PO2 fell by a similar amount, but blood PCO2 was higher during bicarbonate dialysis. The blood pH became alkalotic by the second hour of bicarbonate dialysis and remained so throughout the dialysis, whereas blood pH became alkalotic only at the end of acetate dialysis. The P50 increased significantly only during bicarbonate dialysis, but 2.3 DPG concentration did not change. Red cell volume, assessed by the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, was unchanged. Without changes in the red cell volume we cannot explain the observed changes in P50 in the absence of concomitant changes in 2.3 DPG concentration.\r"

Both dialysate buffers were associated with similar degrees of early peripheral neutropenia, complement activation and elevation of lactoferrin levels, with simultaneous lung localization of radionuclide activity. However, there was not widening of the alveolar to arterial oxygen gradient, or increased wasted ventilatory fraction during this early time period. Significant hypoxemia occurred later in the dialysis, was associated with a decreased respiratory exchange ratio and only occurred with the acetate dialysate buffer. Thus, initial pulmonary leukosequestration was documented but did not have an adverse impact on gas exchange. Hypoxemia during acetate dialysis occurred instead as a consequence of alveolar hypoventilation.\r"

This could be because of a minimal loss of PAs surplus production.

EVS with sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STS) initially produced thrombosis with varying degrees of necrosis and inflammation followed by ulceration, recanalization, and eventually fibrosis with obliteration of varices. Recurrent variceal hemorrhage (VH) leading to death was highest in the acute group since all patients died of uncontrollable VH (100%); it ranged between 50-60% in both the intermediate and chronic groups. Despite variceal obliteration, recurrent hemorrhage developed in the chronic group due to gastric varices or other venous channels in the esophagus or stomach. Additionally, we describe findings not previously reported, such as the presence of sclerosant outside the varices after intravariceal injection, thrombosis of gastric varices after esophageal injections, and the development of muscular wall thickening.\r"

Half-emptying times were 116.4 +/- 7.1 min, 97.8 +/- 13.7 min, and 98.7 +/- 5.6 min, respectively. These also were not statistically different. Values of percentage retention at 2.5 hours for the same groups were 31.6 +/- 5, 24.8 +/- 6.4, and 18.6 +/- 4.4, respectively, again with no statistical difference. Patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis, symptomatic or asymptomatic, have no obvious impairment of gastric emptying of solids.\r"

Therefore, we have evaluated the frequency, extent, and clinical significance of GI complications in 75 consecutive, male, insulin-requiring diabetics (46 with neuropathy). Nineteen percent of the 75 patients and 30% of those with neuropathy had one or more GI symptoms. Esophageal, gastric, gallbladder, and small intestinal functions were studied in 30 patients using radionuclide esophageal and gastric emptying, postprandial gallbladder emptying, and intestinal transit of lactulose. We divided them into three groups: (1) 10 without neuropathy, (2) 10 with peripheral neuropathy, and (3) 10 with autonomic and peripheral neuropathy. Twenty-five patients (83%) had abnormalities of at least one GI organ, and 57% had abnormalities of two. Nineteen of the 25 patients (76%) with GI involvement and 8 of 9 (89%) symptomatic diabetics had delayed esophageal emptying. Symptomatic diabetics had more diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction than asymptomatic diabetics and also had more widespread and more severe gastrointestinal involvement than asymptomatic diabetics. Therefore, our results indicate that in diabetics, (1) gastrointestinal motor abnormalities are common even though they are usually asymptomatic and (2) gastrointestinal dysfunction, especially in symptomatic diabetics, is often widespread and usually includes the esophagus.\r"

  ".U": "88171910\r", 
  ".W": "By identifying some of the social correlates linked with completing day-care drug abuse treatment, the present study has sought to broaden understanding of how drug rehabilitations are effected. As the findings have demonstrated, completing care is a result of a complex array of causes and their interaction. The disposition of the entering patient (i.e., their determination and other strengths) has a great bearing on treatment outcome. It is also a result of the patient's family, their motivations, resources and perseverance in enduring a long course of demanding therapeutic interventions. In addition, it is the product of meanings shared and transmitted between the patient's family and the treatment staff. Patients and their families project positive attitudes about the value of the therapeutic enterprise as well as a compliant demeanor. As staff recognize that patients and parents are acting cooperatively, then such perceptions tend to create self-fulfilling prophecies. The data has established that older adolescent patients are more likely to possess the motivational resources needed for program completion than younger patients. Apparently, self-referred patients are also more inclined to meet the demands of program requirements than those referred by the courts or other outside social agencies, although the differences fell short of the .05 level of statistical significance. Those completing the program are less likely to be diagnosed as depressed at intake. Parental characteristics comprise another group of variables that are related to treatment completion. Parents of higher occupational rank, who have had mental health care for themselves, and who are of Jewish ethnicity appear to possess useful strengths for meeting program challenges. The pattern of spouse mutuality in dealing with a child's needs as it exists preceding and during treatment seems to be another useful asset for successfully getting through this form of treatment. While parents with the above characteristics possess resources that help them to endure the rigors inherent in this form of care, these attributes help project positive images to professional staff about family and patient commitment to treatment. The results of the present study also suggest that certain familial structural arrangements either facilitate or impede program completion. Three particular types of family structures were linked with remaining in treatment longer or finishing: (1) children who were the only children in their families who were living at home; (2) children with siblings who had been in treatment at the program; and (3) children without older brothers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In sum, the two best statistical indicators of drug use in California show that lowering penalties for marijuana possession did not cause a rise in the use of that drug. On the contrary, these indicators point to a stable situation regarding marijuana use in the decade after the implementation of the Moscone Act, while the use of other illegal drugs soared.\r"

No differences were observed in any of the following features: pore length, shape, or size variation; cup/disc and disc/arteriole ratio; clock positions of total rim loss; central retinal vessel entry site; rim pallor; number of rim-crossing vessels; and presence or absence of peripapillary nerve fiber layer hemorrhages, optic pits, and central retinal vessel canals. An hour-glass appearance of connective tissue bundles within the scleral lamina cribrosa, however, was present statistically less often in patients with low-tension glaucoma (p = 0.007). We speculate that the microscopic arrangement of fiber bundles within the lamina cribrosa may play an etiologic role in the pathogenesis of low-tension glaucoma.\r"

The five patients with arthropathy did not differ from the remaining 54 with respect to manifestations of cystic fibrosis. Synovial fluid obtained from two patients during acute episodes was clear, viscous and contained no cells. Biopsies of synovial membrane from the same patients demonstrated prominent congested blood vessels with some synovial oedema, but no evidence of inflammation. Immunofluorescent staining of synovial membrane demonstrated characteristic intimal deposition of immunoglobulin in the vessels. In one of the two patients acute arthropathy was accompanied by transient cutaneous vasculitis, circulating immune complexes and lowered serum complement levels, which suggests that the episodic arthropathy in at least some patients with cystic fibrosis is mediated by an immune mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred and eighteen cases of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma of the head and neck were registered with the Scottish Melanoma Group between 1979 and 1985. Distribution of histogenetic types of melanoma was lentigo maligna melanoma 50 per cent, superficial spreading melanoma 24 per cent, nodular melanoma 20 per cent, unclassifiable 6 per cent. Annual registrations of all types increased over the seven-year period but were less for lentigo maligna melanoma than for the other types. Patients with lentigo maligna melanoma were older, and those with superficial spreading melanoma younger, than the overall average. These two features support the hypothesis that the former may be more closely related to cumulative sunlight exposure than are other histogenetic types of melanoma. The sex ratio (F:M) was 1.7:1 for lentigo maligna melanoma, 1.5:1 for superficial spreading melanoma, but 1:1 for nodular melanoma. All types of melanoma were seen most commonly on the cheek. The proportion of lentigo maligna melanoma on the cheek was significantly greater than nodular melanoma or superficial spreading melanoma. Superficial spreading melanoma was significantly increased in frequency on the neck and scalp, and nodular melanoma on the ear. Melanomas of the scalp were significantly more frequent in male patients than female. The anatomical site distribution of nodular melanoma showed considerable differences between the sexes: nodular melanoma of the ear or neck occurred more commonly in male patients and nodular melanoma of the cheek was significantly more frequent in female patients. Five-year mortality data for head and neck melanoma derived from patients registered between 1979 and 1981 revealed that mortality was greater in male than in female patients, but there was no significant difference in prognosis between the three histogenetic types of melanoma when these were stratified according to tumour thickness.\r"

We believe that these findings are best explained by a resetting of osmoreceptors, a supposition in keeping with contemporary views on the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. This additional evidence of an antidiuretic state in alcohol withdrawal leads us to question the practice of fluid supplementation in its management and we suggest that this policy be revised.\r"

That such a high proportion of patients experience unstable angina as a prodromal symptom makes it possible that myocardial infarction could be prevented in some of these patients.

B cell hybridomas generated by fusion of immune Balb/c splenocytes to NS-1 cells which secreted monoclonal antibodies with specificity for the tricyclic were selected in a standard ELISA.

We performed a prospective study of 26 patients with acute overdose of sustained release theophylline to characterize vomiting, and its possible interference with the acceptance of activated charcoal. Twenty five of 26 patients vomited. The duration of vomiting correlated with both peak serum theophylline concentrations (p less than 0.001) and the duration of theophylline toxicity (p less than 0.001). Vomiting extended over 63% of the drug's absorptive phase (the time interval between ingestion and the peak level) and 49% of the elimination phase (the time interval between the peak level and decrease of theophylline level to less than 20 mcg/ml). Patients with peak serum theophylline concentrations less than 70 mcg/ml were able to accept larger amounts of activated charcoal than patients with serum theophylline concentrations greater than 70 mcg/ml (113 +/- 15 gms vs. 57 +/- 24 gms, p less than 0.05). Vomiting in acute sustained release theophylline toxicity is protracted, and limits the use of activated charcoal especially in patients with severe acute theophylline poisoning.\r"

Fasted adult, male rats were given 40 mg/kg of C-14 labelled SP by gavage (2 ml). Five minutes after drug administration, the animals were given 40 mg of either Darco (G-60), United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or SuperChar (SC) activated charcoals. The charcoals were administered as a slurry in either 1 ml of water, or 1 ml of 70 percent (w/v) sorbitol solution. Water (control) and sorbitol given alone were tested separately. Various pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the plasma concentration of SP determined at various time intervals after drug administration. When given in water, only SC significantly (p less than .01) reduced the peak plasma concentration and oral bioavailability of SP. Sorbitol given alone produced diarrhea but did not affect drug absorption. However, sorbitol selectively enhanced the effectiveness of G-60 and USP charcoals and, as a result, all charcoals significantly reduced SP absorption when given along with the cathartic. The results suggest that when given in water, charcoal antidotal effectiveness is proportional to absorptive surface area, and that sorbitol may enhance the antidotal effectiveness of some charcoals but not others.\r"

  ".W": "Distribution of lidocaine in tissue was investigated after spinal anesthesia and intravenous application in rabbits to examine aspects of forensic and clinical toxicology. Respiratory arrest occurred at 5-15 min after injection of 5 mg/kg hyper-baric lidocaine solution into the subarachnoid space followed by standing in the head down position. The minimum concentration of lidocaine in the middle part of the cervical spinal cord of the dead rabbits was 197 micrograms/g. On the other hand, maximum concentration in the same site at the critical state of almost complete respiratory arrest was 175 micrograms/g. The time at which the concentration of lidocaine reached a maximum in plasma and various tissues after subarachnoid administration was 10-15 min. The concentrations in the lumbar spinal cord, a site of administration, were 1200-1500 micrograms/g 5 min after the injection, which decreased gradually to about 180-250 micrograms/g at 60 min when paralysis of the hind legs began to recover. According to these data, the concentration of lidocaine in the spinal cord of rabbits required for neural blockade was presumed to be about 200 micrograms/g. Since the maximum concentrations of lidocaine in each tissue was already observed at 2.5 min after intravenous injection, transport of lidocaine from plasma to tissues was considered to be very rapid. Lidocaine accumulates most rapidly in the spleen and kidney, followed by the brain, lung, heart, spinal cord and plasma. The concentration in the liver was the least because of its hepatic metabolism. Distribution to adipose tissue was slower than that to other tissues, but the highest accumulation was observed at the late stage. Elimination rates of plasma and tissues other than adipose were almost the same.\r"

In contrast, the remaining 16 patients who had no evidence of white matter degeneration revealed no hybridization to the HIV probe. The cells infected with HIV included endothelial cells, perivascular macrophages/monocytes, and multinucleated giant cells and were found in or adjacent to white matter degeneration.

HTLV-IIIB and LAV differ slightly from each other even when grown in the same cell line, while LAV grown in a B cell line is less related. Molecularly distant isolates have unique patterns. While anti-HTLV-IIIB gp120 antibody neutralized both HTLV-IIIB and LAV, it recognizes only the homologous HTLV-IIIB infected cells in cytotoxicity assays. Structural analysis of isolates should be helpful in defining the range of immunological reactivities among variants as a contribution to a rational approach to a vaccine against AIDS.\r"

Seventy percent of patients revealed palpable nodes at their first examination, with a higher percentage for HC (73%) than LEC (62%). The 5-year survival rate was divided by three in the presence of contralateral, bilateral, or fixed nodes, or in cases of nodes exceeding 3 cm. Multiple positive nodes, extracapsular spread, or lower-neck positive nodes significantly decreased survival, doubled the number of neck recurrences, and tripled the number of distant metastases while control at the primary site remained unvaried.\r"

  ".W": "Between March 1973 and June 1979, patients with advanced operable squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx or hypopharynx were randomly allocated to receive either preoperative radiation therapy (5,000 rad) or postoperative radiation therapy (6,000 rad). Patients with oral cavity or oropharynx lesions were randomly assigned either preoperative radiation, postoperative radiation, or definitive radiation therapy (6,500-7,000 rad), with surgery reserved for salvage if residual disease was present 6 weeks after completion of irradiation. Three hundred twenty patients were evaluable with a median follow-up of 60 months. Based on results in 277 patients across all four regions combined, locoregional control was significantly better for patients assigned to receive postoperative radiation therapy (65%) compared with those assigned to receive preoperative radiation therapy (48%, P = 0.04). This was due to a higher rate of both persistent and recurrent local and regional disease in the preoperative group. Survival also showed a trend to be better in the postoperative group (38%) compared with the preoperative group (33%, P = 0.10). Rates of severe surgical and radiation therapy complications were similar overall. Forty-three patients were evaluable for each of the three treatment regimens assigned to patients with oral cavity or oropharynx lesions. Due to the small number of patients available for this portion of the trial, the observed differences for overall survival (4-year percentage 33% overall; 30% preoperative, 36% postoperative, 33% definitive radiation therapy) and for locoregional control (45% overall; 43% preoperative, 52% postoperative, 38% definitive radiation therapy) were not statistically significant. The use of definitive radiation therapy with surgical rescue as an ethically justified alternative treatment for these tumors remains a question for further research.\r"

Thirty-eight lesions were treated with radiotherapy after incisional biopsy, and 16 were treated after excisional biopsy (specimens showed positive margins).

Four of six recurrences were subsequently controlled by limited surgical excision and repair with preservation of the eye, whereas the other two required enucleation. Treatment sequelae such as skin atrophy, telangiectasis, and cosmetic results were evaluated in terms of radiotherapy parameters, pretreatment surgery, and size of the lesion. In 44 patients, the overall cosmetic result was judged as good to excellent, five patients had a mild to modest degree of deformity, and five had significant deformity. Such deformity was usually associated with tumor destruction or previous surgery. No major complications were noted.\r"

This is usually the result of scar formation with the associated morbidity dependent on the location, extent, and thickness of the tissue. Because of this variability, a single treatment protocol cannot be recommended. The procedure used to correct the stenosis must be tailored to the case in question. This paper reviews the treatment of laryngotracheal stenosis, specifically focusing on the variables in the preoperative assessment that must be considered in selecting an appropriate treatment plan.\r"

The second part of the study reported 152 cases treated by external radiotherapy alone either as a variant of our treatment protocol for the small-sized tumors (31 cases) or, for the major part (121 cases), as a result of surgical inoperability or patient refusal. The former subgroup had a variable survival rate (65% at 3 years and 40% at 5 years) equivalent to similarly staged patients treated with conservation laryngeal surgery, whereas the prognosis of the latter subgroup was poor. The two main causes of failure were the inability to apply the curative treatment protocol in 35% of patients ineligible for a surgery and the high risk of distant metastases in the 65% of patients able to undergo the usual management.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective study of 75 consecutive cases of spontaneous cerebellar haemorrhage was undertaken in order to evaluate the clinical features and natural history of this condition. A wide spectrum of clinical findings contributed to the poor clinical diagnostic accuracy of 23 per cent, with common misdiagnoses including brainstem stroke and vestibular or labyrinthine disturbance. Presentation with, or the later development of stupor or coma strongly correlated with poor outcome (severe disability or death; p = 0.002). The characteristics of conscious patients who remained stable were compared with those who subsequently deteriorated. The initial conscious state (alert, drowsy or confused), severity of symptoms and ataxia, and the size of haemorrhage on CT scan were not reliable prognostic indicators. However, the presence of bilateral gaze paresis, anarthria (present in eight cases), limb weakness, a systolic blood pressure above 200 mmHg and moderate hydrocephalus significantly correlated with a poor outcome. The presence of these signs warrants consideration of urgent surgical intervention at the time of diagnosis. Since no clinical or radiological findings excluded the possibility of further deterioration, careful monitoring in an intensive care unit is necessary within the first 48 h in those conscious patients who are likely to remain stable. Guidelines for making the clinical diagnosis and for selecting those patients who will require transfer to adequately equipped centres are suggested.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma lactate concentrations and acid-base status were determined in 53 patients poisoned with paracetamol. Eleven patients (Group 1) had plasma paracetamol concentrations below the standard treatment decision line; 19 cases (Group 2) presenting within 15 h of overdose had plasma paracetamol concentrations above the treatment line and received N-acetylcysteine. The remaining 23 patients (Group 3) arrived at hospital too late (more than 15 h after overdose) for treatment with N-acetylcysteine to be completely effective. Compensated metabolic acidosis was present on admission in 55 per cent of Group 1 and 42 per cent of Group 2 patients, and a further 21 per cent of cases in Group 2 had an uncompensated metabolic acidosis. Half the patients in Group 3 were acidotic: 22 per cent had a compensated and 26 per cent an uncompensated metabolic acidosis. On admission, the mean plasma lactate concentration was elevated in both Group 2 and Group 3 patients though not in Group 1 cases. Plasma lactate concentration then fell to normal in patients in Group 2 but became mildly elevated again in some cases at a time which coincided closely with the peak in serum aspartate aminotransferase activity. In patients presenting within 15 h of overdose there was a significant correlation between the elevation in plasma concentrations of lactate and paracetamol at admission. In patients presenting late (Group 3), plasma lactate remained elevated for longer than in Group 2 and acidosis and hyperlactataemia were prominent features in the four patients who died. This study demonstrates first that hyperlactataemia, with or without significant acid-base disturbance, is common following paracetamol overdose particularly in those who are severely poisoned. As uncompensated metabolic acidosis is found in 20 per cent of patients who present early and require protective therapy, it should be sought and corrected if it does not remit spontaneously. Second, half the patients presenting too late for effective treatment are acidotic and those with an uncompensated metabolic acidosis resistant to correction have a poor prognosis. Paracetamol poisoning should be considered in the differential diagnosis of metabolic acidosis of unknown aetiology.\r"

Using a visual analogue scale (0-10 cm) we studied osmotically stimulated thirst induced by hypertonic saline infusion in 15 patients with diabetes insipidus and 15 healthy controls. Plasma osmolality in the patients rose from 292 +/- 1 to 316 +/- 1 mOsm/kg (p less than 0.001), and 13 patients showed a progressive rise in thirst ratings (1.4 +/- 0.4 to 8.1 +/- 0.3 cm, p less than 0.001) with abolition of thirst by drinking, in a similar fashion to controls. Water intake following infusion was greater in patients than controls (p less than 0.001). Linear regression analysis of thirst and plasma osmolality showed no difference in the osmotic threshold for thirst onset, or the sensitivity of thirst osmoreceptors, between 13 of the patients and the control group. One patient was shown to be hypodipsic and compulsive water drinking was demonstrated in another: abnormal thirst perception caused abnormalities of salt and water balance in these two patients. Most patients with cranial diabetes insipidus have normal thirst mechanisms, though clinically significant hypodipsia or hyperdipsia may co-exist with vasopressin deficiency.\r"

However these assays are subject to in-vitro interference in two ways: where there is a variant serum albumin in familial dysalbuminaemic hyperthyroxinaemia, or where there are circulating thyroid hormone binding antibodies. In both these situations a spuriously high result for free thyroxine is obtained. This may have serious implications for patient management and we describe 10 patients in whom the finding of a misleadingly high free thyroxine concentration led to confusion in diagnosis and, in eight of the 10, to inappropriate antithyroid treatment. Clinicians should be aware of these technical problems and where a result for the free thyroxine concentration seems inappropriate to the patient's clinical state then measurement of thyrotrophin (TSH) by a sensitive immunometric method should be performed. If the results remain confusing the presence of a variant serum albumin or thyroid hormone binding antibodies should be sought.\r"

The entire United States population exhibited an increasing leukemia rate during and for several years after the open air nuclear testing and fell sharply thereafter. Regional differences in leukemia rates correspond to a composite exposure index that used 90Sr concentrations in food, cow's milk, and human bone. The calculated leukemia risk per rad for children was similar to that calculated for Japanese A-bomb children survivors.\r"

Smokers displayed significantly elevated breath levels of benzene, styrene, ethylbenzene, m + p-xylene, o-xylene, and octane. Significant increases in breath concentration with number of cigarettes smoked were noted for the first four aromatic compounds. Based on direct measurements of benzene in mainstream cigarette smoke, it is calculated that a typical smoker inhales 2 mg benzene daily, compared to 0.2 mg/day for the nonsmoker. Thus, cigarette smoking may be the most important source of exposure to benzene for about 50 million citizens of the United States. Passive smokers exposed at work had significantly elevated levels of aromatics in their breath. Indoor air levels in homes with smokers were significantly greater than in nonsmoking homes during fall and winter but not during spring and summer. The average annual increase in homes with smokers was 3.6 microgram/m3 for benzene and 0.5 microgram/m3 for styrene--an approximate 50% relative increase in each case. Thus, exposure to benzene and styrene may be increased for the approximately 60% of children and other nonsmokers living in homes with smokers.\r"

Due to data limitations, including changes in clinical laboratories and lack of pre-exposure data for some patients, the analysis was focused on 17 patients for whom data was produced by the same clinical laboratory, for 3 months of pre-exposure and 1 month of exposure. Least-squares means of each parameter by CIO2 levels of 0.0 and 1.0 mg/L at the treatment plant were adjusted for age, sex, and creatinine. Water purification at the clinic included passing the water through granular activated carbon, filtration by 5-mu filters, and the use of reverse osmosis. Chlorination products measured at the clinic after this purification and prior to preparation of the dialysate consisted only of chlorite at the 0.02-0.08 mg/L level. No evidence of CIO2-induced anemia was found, nor were any other biologically significant responses observed. Study limitations include several potentially important hematologic parameters which were not measured, the small sample size, and three clinical laboratory changes.\r"

Facial hypoesthesia, when present, was global and predominant in the mandibular and maxillary nerve areas, associated or not with absent reflexes. A disturbed TSEP was found in 40 subjects which was predictable from their clinical symptoms. Correlation with exposure parameters (duration of exposure, trichlorethanol, and trichloracetic acid urinary rates) was mainly observed in subjects presenting both clinical and electrical alterations. Electrical alterations alone were less predictive. An abnormal TSEP may thus provide objective determination of risk assessment in the absence of clinical signs.\r"

The data seem to indicate that people with lung cancer have spent a larger part of their life in a mining zone. The reason for that phenomenon cannot, however, be assessed clearly. This could be due to the geographical environment, i.e., the presence of nickel and asbestos in the soil of some parts of the territory; the observed relationship could also be due, in part, to the effects of urbanization leading to increased tobacco consumption.\r"
