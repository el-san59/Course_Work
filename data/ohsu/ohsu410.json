In the supine position, ANP was increased (361 +/- 202 pg/ml); however, only a loose correlation existed between atrial pressures and ANP (right atrial vs ANP, r = 0.03, p = N.S., and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures vs ANP, r = 0.4, p = N.S.). Standing and acute captopril therapy decreased atrial pressures and ANP but did not significantly improve the correlation between atrial pressures and ANP. With chronic captopril therapy, atrial pressures remained decreased; however, ANP had returned to control values (370 +/- 254 pg/ml vs 361 +/- 202 pg/ml) and failed to decrease with standing (370 +/- 259 pg/ml lying vs 351 +/- 194 pg/ml standing). These changes in ANP (with chronic captopril therapy) persisted even once the hemodynamic effects of captopril had dissipated (3 hours post dose). This study indicates that in patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (1) only a poor correlation exists between ANP and atrial pressures and (2) with chronic captopril therapy ANP increases to higher levels for a given atrial pressure and fails to decrease with standing despite a decrease in atrial pressures.\r"

  ".W": "Nitroglycerin and calcium antagonists are direct dilators of large coronary arteries. Their amelioration of myocardial ischemia may be in part related to their dilating action on coronary stenoses. The present study was done to determine if the effects of calcium antagonists and nitroglycerin on large coronary arterial diameter are additive. External circumflex coronary arterial diameter was measured by sonomicrometry in 16 awake, instrumented dogs. Intravenous nifedipine (mean dose 30 +/- 4 micrograms/kg) caused dilation of the circumflex coronary artery (4.01 +/- 0.13 to 4.10 +/- 0.12 mm, p less than 0.05). The addition of intravenous nitroglycerin (10 to 20 micrograms/kg) caused further coronary arterial dilation (4.10 +/- 0.12 to 4.13 +/- 0.12 mm, p less than 0.05). Intravenous verapamil (mean dose 520 +/- 77 micrograms/kg) also caused dilation of the circumflex coronary artery (4.14 +/- 0.35 to 4.26 +/- 0.35 mm, p less than 0.05). The addition of intravenous nitroglycerin caused further dilation (4.26 +/- 0.35 to 4.31 +/- 0.35 mm, p less than 0.05). Intravenous diltiazem (mean dose 640 +/- 140 micrograms/kg) caused circumflex coronary arterial dilation in four of the five dogs studied (mean change 4.14 +/- 0.36 to 4.21 +/- 0.33 mm). The addition of intravenous nitroglycerin caused further circumflex coronary dilation (4.21 +/- 0.33 to 4.26 +/- 0.33 mm, p less than 0.05). Therefore, the effects of nitroglycerin and each of these three calcium antagonists on large coronary diameter are additive, with the combination of nitroglycerin and the calcium antagonist causing more large coronary dilation than the calcium antagonist alone.\r"

  ".W": "Sotalol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent with Vaughn-Williams class III activity. Its efficacy was tested in 9 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) that had previously remained inducible during electrophysiologic testing of type I drugs (procainamide or quinidine). Eight patients had coronary artery disease with remote myocardial infarction and 1 had cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 0.34 +/- 0.08, mean +/- standard deviation). Type I drugs prolonged the effective refractory period of the right ventricle 12 +/- 14% and prolonged the VT cycle length 41 +/- 24%. In contrast, despite an equivalent effect on the effective refractory period, a sustained VT could no longer be initiated in any of the 8 patients ultimately tested while taking oral sotalol. Daily doses averaged 600 +/- 103 mg and blood levels associated with VT suppression in electrophysiologic studies were generally greater than 3,000 ng/ml. In addition, sotalol was moderately effective at reducing ventricular ectopic activity measured by ambulatory electrocardiography. Over a mean follow-up of 23 months (range 1 to 37), mild heart failure (3 patients), symptomatic brady-cardia requiring pacemaker (1) and drug-related polymorphous VT (1) have occurred. Sudden death occurred in 1 patient and nonfatal VT recurrence was noted in 2. Five of 8 chronically treated patients currently are successfully treated with minimal side effects. Sotalol appears to be a promising antiarrhythmic drug in the treatment of serious ventricular arrhythmias, even in patients refractory to type I antiarrhythmic agents.\r"

Group A (12 patients) received 20 mg of rscu-PA as a bolus followed by 60 mg infused over 1 hour and group B received 10 mg as a bolus and 30 mg as infusion. The 2 groups showed no significant difference in age, sex, height, weight, time between onset of symptoms and start of therapy, peak values and course of infarct-related enzymes. Time to reperfusion was 43 minutes in group A versus 67 minutes in group B (p less than 0.005). The rate of reperfusion 90 minutes after start of treatment was 91% in group A and 50% in group B (p less than 0.001). Plasma levels of fibrinogen, plasminogen and alpha-2-antiplasmin did not differ significantly in both groups. Systemic lytic state (fibrinogen less than 100 mg/dl) occurred in 33% of group A and in 9% of group B. Intravenous infusion of 80 mg (but not 40 mg) of rscu-PA led to reperfusion of the occluded coronary artery in nearly all patients.

To determine the optimal treatment regimen, prourokinase was applied in 3 different ways: group I received a bolus of 7.5 mg and a subsequent infusion of 40.5 mg over 60 minutes. Patency of the infarct artery was observed in 7 patients (50%) at the end of the infusion time. One hour after the end of the infusion the fibrinogen level had decreased to 87 +/- 12% of the preinfusion level; the plasminogen and alpha-2 antiplasmin levels to 61 +/- 13% and 59 +/- 34%, respectively. In group II prourokinase was administered as a 7.5 mg bolus followed by 66.5 mg over 60 minutes. Eleven patients (55%) had patent infarct-related coronary arteries and fibrinogen, plasminogen and alpha-2 antiplasmin levels had decreased to 58 +/- 29%, 38 +/- 18% and 21 +/- 14%, respectively. Group III was treated with a bolus of 3.7 mg prourokinase and 250,000 IU urokinase followed by 44.3 mg prourokinase, resulting in a patency rate of 65% (13 patients). Fibrinogen, plasminogen and alpha-2 antiplasmin levels decreased to 76 +/- 15%, 67 +/- 15% and 47 +/- 29%, respectively. Fibrin-specific thrombolysis can be achieved with glycosylated prourokinase. At higher dosages considerable systemic activation of the fibrinolytic system with little enhancement of the observed therapeutic effect occurred. The combination of prourokinase and urokinase yielded a higher patency rate than either dosage of prourokinase alone, although the difference was not statistically significant in this pilot trial.\r"

Since psychosocial factors have been implicated in the etiology of sudden cardiac death, it is possible that this association may emerge if sudden cardiac death is distinguished as an outcome distinct from other cardiac mortality. Predictors of sudden death and other cardiac outcomes were examined using data from the Recurrent Coronary Prevention Project, a 4.5-year prospective clinical trial of 1,012 postinfarction patients begun in San Francisco in 1978. A unique set of risk factors was found for the differing outcomes: sudden cardiac death had predominantly psychosocial predictors while nonsudden cardiac death and nonfatal recurrences were predominantly predicted by biologic factors. Type A behavior was an independent predictor of sudden, but not nonsudden, cardiac death in this population (p = 0.04). These results are the first demonstration of a direct relation between stress and sudden cardiac death in a large prospective clinical study, and provide insight into the failure of past prospective studies to find an association between type A behavior and cardiac mortality.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the current use of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in the treatment of coronary artery disease, 50 operators experienced in angioplasty (mean experience 949 +/- 706 cases) were surveyed. Although the use of angioplasty is still skewed toward less extensive disease (80% of 1-, 64% of 2- and 39% of 3-vessel disease), it is now estimated that 39 +/- 16% of patients undergoing diagnostic angiography are ultimately referred for PTCA, whereas only 28 +/- 13% are referred to bypass surgery. PTCA thus accounts for 58% of revascularization. Although approximately half of current PTCA patients are clinical candidates for bypass surgery, much of the growth of angioplasty has consisted of treating patients who are either too high a risk for bypass, or who have symptoms with medical therapy that are too mild to warrant surgery. Whereas elective procedures for stable angina (60 +/- 18%) are still the predominant indication for PTCA, a substantial fraction of procedures are performed for unstable angina (27 +/- 10%) or for acute myocardial infarction (13 +/- 15%). Despite a 91% current success rate, 9% of cases are unsuccessful, including 3% in which emergency bypass surgery is required. The most common reasons for unsuccessful procedures are failure to cross the lesion with a wire or balloon (52%), failure to dilate the lesion (4%), and abrupt closure of the dilated segment (44%) due predominantly to extensive local dissection. These data, based on a pooled experience of some 46,000 PTCA procedures, offer a unique glimpse into the current expanded application of this technique.\r"

Both global ejection fraction (EF) and regional wall motion of the infarct zone were measured to assess serial changes.

To examine the accuracy of 2H2(18)O during changing nutritional regimens, we compared 2H2(18)O and periodic open-circuit respiratory gas exchange (RGE) in postsurgical infants who were changing from parenteral to alternative parenteral and/or oral nutrition. The two methods were compared before and after correction for shifts in isotopic abundance of the infant water pools during the energy-expenditure period. Baseline corrections were predicted using the difference between abundances of the initial body water and final nutrient solutions. Before isotopic correction, 2H2(18)O underestimated RCO2 in eight subjects by 11.8 +/- 20.1% (mean +/- SD). After correction, agreement between the two methods improved; the underestimate was then -8.7 +/- 12.9%. To obtain maximum precision of 2H2(18)O, subjects should be maintained on the same nutritional regimen before and during the study unless valid correction formulae are used.\r"

In nine patients TSH responses to TRH were normal in five, delayed in three, and low in one.

With respect to the T3 response to TRH, various indices in patients appeared significantly lower than in the control subjects.

The residual ileum demonstrated increased sucrase activity per unit length but was indistinguishable from control ileal segments in activity per unit DNA or villus distribution. Lactase activity was negligible in all segments of the residual intestine. Villus height and crypt depth were increased in the residual ileum with slight increases in cell turnover and cell-migration rates.

If decreased effective circulating blood volume is important in pathogenesis of ascites, plasma ANP levels would be expected to be decreased in ascitic subjects because of decreased atrial distension. To test this hypothesis, we measured plasma ANP by competitive radioimmunoassay in three groups of fasted, supine hospitalized subjects: nine noncirrhotic control subjects, 12 cirrhotics without ascites, and 17 cirrhotics with moderate to marked ascites. Immunoreactive plasma ANP concentrations were 195 +/- 41, 171 +/- 31, and 137 +/- 34 pg/ml (m +/- SD), respectively, in the three groups. The mean concentration in the group with cirrhosis and ascites was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) les than those of the other two groups, which did not differ from one another. These results support the concept that decreased effective circulating volume plays a role in pathogenesis of cirrhotic ascites, and that a relative deficiency of ANP plays a role in the sodium retention of decompensated cirrhosis.\r"

After at least 72 h, this was repeated 1 h after taking 750 mg of chenodiol orally. The amount of each sugar excreted in the urine was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. Chenodiol doubled the percent urinary excretion of lactulose from 0.21 +/- 0.12 (SD) to 0.42% +/- 0.25 (p less than 0.02) and the ratio of lactulose to mannitol or to rhamnose [0.012 +/- 0.005 to 0.027 +/- 0.013 (p less than 0.01) and 0.045 +/- 0.022 to 0.087 +/- 0.039 (p less than 0.05), respectively].

An attempt was made to determine if this association might be due to an effect of alcohol on apolipoproteins A-I and B and to determine if low-dose alcohol intake might have a potentially protective effect by this mechanism in persons at increased risk for coronary heart disease. To address this, an eight-week prospective randomized clinical trial of abstention versus low-dose alcohol consumption, defined as one beverage per day, was conducted in white men, aged 21 to 60 years, most of whom were patients of a preventive cardiology program. Apolipoprotein A-I levels had a mean increase of 9 mg/dl in the 28 participants who drank alcohol compared with a mean decline of 5 mg/dl in the 28 participants who abstained (p less than 0.005). This association was independent of other cardiovascular risk factors. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-B levels had a mean increase of 7 mg/dl in both arms of the trial (NS). However, the ratio of apolipoprotein A-I to LDL-B increased by 4 percent in the drinkers and decreased 10 percent in the abstainers (p less than 0.03). No significant changes in mean levels of total high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-, HDL2-, or HDL3-cholesterol were observed with this low dose of alcohol. This effect on apolipoprotein A-I suggests a possible mechanism by which low-dose alcohol may lower the risk of coronary heart disease.\r"

Each peak contains materials that have characteristic biological activity. P1 contains a material that relaxes blood vessels and is structurally similar to a vasodilator, the 5,6 epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET). P2 contains a material that inhibits cardiac Na+-K+-ATPase, the major component of which has been identified as the 11,12 dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid. In mTALH cells obtained from rabbits made hypertensive by aortic coarctation, there was a selective increase in P1 and P2 formation compared to other renomedullary cells. We have identified AA metabolites in bovine corneal epithelium with biological properties and chemical features similar to those of mTALH cells. 12(R)hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(R) HETE) a possible derivative of the 11,12-EET, is produced by the cornea and also has been shown to inhibit Na+-K+-ATPase activity.

  ".W": "Arachidonic acid, which is esterified mainly at the Sn-2 position of phospholipids, is deacylated in response to a wide variety of neurohormonal stimuli, including sympathetic nerve stimulation and catecholamines. In most cardiovascular tissues, arachidonic acid is metabolized via the cyclooxygenase pathway into prostaglandins. The kind and quantity of prostaglandins formed in response to adrenergic stimuli vary in different tissues. For example, PGE2 is the major product of arachidonic acid formed in the spleen and kidney and PGI2 in the heart in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation and norepinephrine. The sequence of events, including the type of adrenergic receptor involved in the action of catecholamines on PG synthesis, varies from tissue to tissue. For example, PG synthesis elicited by adrenergic stimulation in the heart is mediated via activation of beta-1 adrenergic receptors, whereas in the kidney it is linked to stimulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Moreover, prostaglandin synthesis elicited by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activation in the kidney requires only partially extra- but mainly intracellular Ca++ and calmodulin. However, beta-1 adrenergic receptor stimulated PG synthesis in the heart is absolutely dependent upon extracellular Ca++ but not on calmodulin. Furthermore, alpha-1 but not beta-1 adrenergic receptor stimulated PG synthesis is inhibited by mepacrine, a phospholipase A2 and C inhibitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Arterial baroreceptors are reset when their afferent nerve activity is reduced at an equivalent arterial pressure and vascular strain. Resetting occurs as a result of stretch of the baroreceptors, usually during an acute or chronic rise in arterial pressure. It may be seen during the diastolic phase of a cardiac cycle (instantaneous resetting), after brief exposure to a sustained elevation of pressure (acute resetting), and after chronic elevation of pressure or in physiologic or pathologic states associated with structural changes in the vascular regions of baroreceptors (chronic resetting). The mechanisms reviewed here include mechanical, ionic and chemical factors. Viscoelastic properties of the carotid sinus and aortic arch may explain the instantaneous resetting that occurs with each cardiac cycle when activity begins in early systole and stops in early diastole. Viscoelastic properties and ionic mechanisms may play a role in acute resetting. Inhibition of Na+K+ ATPase reduces the magnitude of acute resetting. The release of chemicals from the endothelium may modulate baroreceptor activity. Exogenous prostacyclin suppresses and indomethacin augments acute resetting in the rabbit, suggesting that the release of endogenous prostacyclin during a rise in arterial pressure attenuates resetting. Changes in pulsatility and blood flow also may modulate baroreceptor activity. The addition of pulsatile pressure at an increased mean pressure attenuates resetting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purposes of this study were to investigate the effect of a superactive agonistic analog of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, nafarelin, on uterine leiomyomas and to assess the use of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring uterine and myoma size. Eleven women with uterine leiomyomas were treated with 800 micrograms of nafarelin per day for 6 months. Serum gonadotropin and estradiol concentrations were suppressed during treatment. The mean +/- SEM serum luteinizing hormone level decreased from 11.1 +/- 1.4 to 5.6 +/- 0.42 mlU/ml and follicle-stimulating hormone from 9.5 +/- 0.66 to 7.5 +/- 0.72 mlU/ml by 3 months of treatment (p less than 0.01). The estradiol level decreased from a pretreatment follicular phase mean +/- SEM of 43 +/- 8.3 to 19.8 +/- 3.1 (p less than 0.05) and 14.8 +/- 2.2 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) at 3 and 6 months of treatment, respectively. Mean pretreatment androgen levels (testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) were low in these women and did not change significantly during treatment. Ten women had magnetic resonance imaging, which provided excellent resolution of individual uterine myomas. As assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, the largest myoma decreased in size in nine of 10 women; the mean decrease was 46% +/- 9%. Uterine volume decreased in all 10 patients; the mean decrease was 57% +/- 7%. In several women myomas reenlarged after discontinuance of nafarelin treatment. Posttreatment myomectomy was carried out in four women; there was minimal blood loss and no surgical complications. These data indicate that suppression of ovarian estrogen production with nafarelin is associated with a decrease in uterine myoma size in many women but that myomas may regrow with reinstitution of ovarian function. Magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent method by which to monitor treatment as changes in the size of the uterus, as well as individual myomas, can be assessed. The optimal use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs may be in perimenopausal women or as presurgical treatment to decrease uterine and myoma size to facilitate myomectomy.\r"

The infusion rates for both drugs were controlled by microprocessors in order to institute constant blood levels adapted to the patients' varying needs. The mean blood level of propofol required for adequate hypnosis during anaesthesia was 2.42 micrograms/ml (SD 0.43). Awakening occurred 7.9 minutes (SD 3.4) after the end of the infusion, at a propofol blood level of 1.59 micrograms/ml (SD 0.34). The plasma level of alfentanil was 285 ng/ml (SD 72) during major noxious stimulation and 148 ng/ml (SD 56) during minor stimulation. The computer-assisted infusions showed a measured/predicted ratio of 1.01 (SD 0.28) for alfentanil and 0.88 (SD 0.22) for propofol. This indicates that the administration device used in this study is reasonably reliable. The technique of total intravenous anaesthesia was characterised by a smooth induction without significant haemodynamic alterations, by good control during anaesthesia and by a very fast recovery without major side effects.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of a constant rate infusion of propofol were studied in 11 patients who received total intravenous anaesthesia for ENT surgery. Alfentanil was administered as an exponentially decreasing infusion using a computer-assisted infusion device with a constant target plasma alfentanil concentration of 300 ng/ml. Propofol was infused at a constant rate of 6 mg/kg/hours. Plasma alfentanil concentrations were determined by gas chromatography and whole blood propofol concentrations by high-performance liquid chromatography in arterial blood samples collected at selected times during and up to 8 hours after infusion. Pharmacokinetic modelling of the blood propofol concentration-time data indicated that a three-compartment open model with central elimination was most appropriate. Derived pharmacokinetic parameters were in agreement with previous studies on the pharmacokinetics of propofol. The plasma alfentanil concentrations in 10 patients significantly exceeded the expected values at any time during the infusion. The population mean bias amounted to 20.2% (SD 12.6). Only three data sets were significantly underestimated after the infusion was stopped (mean bias 11.9% (SD 25.5]. The elimination half-life of alfentanil was approximately 75 minutes (SD 21). We conclude that alfentanil does not interfere with the pharmacokinetic profile of propofol but that propofol induces higher plasma alfentanil concentrations than expected.\r"

  ".W": "Propofol and methohexitone were evaluated as hypnotics in a total intravenous anaesthesia technique without nitrous oxide in 50 patients of ASA grade 1 or 2. Analgesia was provided by a constant alfentanil infusion and the depth of anaesthesia was controlled by varying the infusion rate of propofol or methohexitone. Induction and intubation responses were smooth and moderate in the propofol group and side effects were few. Control of depth of anaesthesia, blood pressure and pulse rate was relatively easy in this group but more difficult and sometimes inadequate in the methohexitone group, in which side effects were more frequent. The mean infusion rate for propofol was 0.12 mg/kg/minute, similar to those found in studies using nitrous oxide without an opioid. Recovery times were short in both groups but those in the propofol group tended to be shorter. Postoperatively 96% of the propofol patients were clear-headed within 20 minutes, in contrast to only 48% in the methohexitone group. We conclude that propofol together with alfentanil, both given by a bolus plus infusion technique, provide controllable and satisfactory total intravenous anaesthesia without recourse to nitrous oxide or other inhalational agents. Methohexitone was not as satisfactory as propofol.\r"

The variables were the airway deadspace (VDaw), Bohr's deadspace (VDBohr) obtained noninvasively using end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) for alveolar PCO2 in the deadspace equation, and the physiologic deadspace, VDphys. In 42 children with normal single breath tests, VDaw was two-thirds of VDBohr; in 9 children in whom phase III of SBT-CO2 (the \"alveolar plateau\") was steeper than normal, it was only half of VDBohr. Steeper slopes of phase III were seen particularly in the present of left-right (LR) shunting. VDphys was very similar in magnitude to VDBohr in all children, except those with right-left (RL) shunts. VDaw was the major component of VDphys only in children with normal arterial-end-tidal PCO2 differences, i.e., those without RL shunts. When two ventilator frequencies giving the same alveolar ventilation were compared in children with normal gas exchange, VDBohr as a fraction of tidal volume was least at the lower frequency, as it also is in adults. The data confirm that noninvasive CO2 monitoring and measurement of deadspace gives useful indexes of the adequacy of ventilation in all children except those with RL shunts.\r"

We conducted a study to investigate the effect of DCA treatment on lactic acidosis following resuscitation from asphyxial cardiac arrest. Conditioned dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg), endotracheally intubated, and mechanically ventilated to maintain an arterial pCO2 of 30 to 40 mm Hg. Asphyxial cardiac arrest was produced by endotracheal tube occlusion for six to eight minutes. After five minutes of cardiac arrest, the endotracheal tube was unclamped and closed-chest CPR was begun. Six animals received DCA 100 mg/kg IV push after one minute of CPR. Control animals (n = 6) received an equal volume of saline. CPR was continued until the return of a spontaneous pulse, when mechanical ventilation was resumed. Arterial and venous blood gases, glucose, and lactate levels were obtained at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after resuscitation. Mean arterial blood pressure, pulse, and glucose, and venous and arterial blood gases were similar in both groups throughout the study. By 45 minutes after resuscitation, the DCA-treated group showed a significantly faster rate of decline in lactate levels that continued to the final sampling period. By 90 minutes, arterial lactate in DCA animals was not significantly different from baseline (pre-arrest) values. DCA given during cardiac arrest will cause a more rapid normalization of arterial lactate after successful resuscitation. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of lowered lactic acid on survival and neurological outcome following cardiac arrest.\r"

Animals were randomly chosen to receive 4 or 10 days of no therapy (controls), pefloxacin (40 mg/kg [body weight] per day, intramuscularly [i.m.]), or amikacin (30 or 80 mg/kg per day, i.m.)-ceftazidime (150 mg/kg per day, i.m.). Pefloxacin and both amikacin regimens significantly reduced vegetation bacterial densities compared with controls at days 4 and 10 of treatment (P less than 0.0005). By day 10 of therapy, between 33 and 40% of vegetations from amikacin-ceftazidime recipients contained ceftazidime-resistant bacteria (MICs, greater than 25 micrograms/ml); nitrocefin agar overlay confirmed that these ceftazidime-resistant variants were constitutive overproducers of beta-lactamase. At therapy days 4 and 10, approximately 30% of vegetations sampled from pefloxacin recipients contained bacteria for which pefloxacin MICs were four- to eightfold higher than the MIC for the parental strain used to initially induce endocarditis (MIC, 0.19 microgram/ml). These variants also exhibited increases in ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin MICs, as well as pleotropic resistance to chloramphenicol (but not to amikacin, ceftazidime, or tetracycline). Amikacin-ceftazidime, as well as pefloxacin, was effective in this model of aortic pseudomonal endocarditis. However, in vivo development of ceftazidime resistance and step-ups in pefloxacin MICs among intravegetation isolates were associated with inability to completely eradicate P. aeruginosa from aortic vegetations.\r"

Nifurtimox-treated chagasic animals injected with 2,500 trypomastigotes developed higher parasitemia and increased mortality compared with nontreated chagasic mice. When reinfection was done with 25 trypomastigotes, treated and nontreated animals showed similar parasitemias and mortalities, which were significantly higher in nonchagasic controls infected for the first time. Immunological studies showed that treatment with nifurtimox led to a decrease in anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies engaged in parasite destruction, inducing either complement-dependent lysis or antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, but no difference in anti-T. cruzi cell-mediated immunity was found between treated and nontreated chagasic animals. It is concluded that treatment with nifurtimox leads to a loss of resistance to reinfection with a large number of trypanosomes, which is maintained with challenge with a few parasites, and that these two thresholds of premunition are probably associated with humoral and cell-mediated anti-T. cruzi immune responses, respectively.\r"

The pharmacokinetic behavior of trimetrexate administered either by intravenous bolus or orally was studied in six patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with a reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography assay. The mean clearance following bolus injection was 38 ml/min per m2, with a range of 15 to 55 ml/min per m2. The postdistributive half-life ranged from 6 to 16 h. With oral administration, the mean bioavailability was 44% (range, 19 to 67%). An oral dose of 60 mg/m2 (162 mumol/m2) resulted in concentrations in plasma that approximated those achieved with a 30-mg/m2 (81-mumol/m2) intravenous dose. The toxicity of this combination regimen was minimal. It appears that the oral route is a practical route of administration for trimetrexate in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome requiring long-term outpatient treatment or prophylaxis for P. carinii pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "Ribavirin (1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) was markedly inhibitory in vitro to Adames and Balliet strains of Punta Toro virus (PTV), a Phlebovirus related to Rift Valley fever and sandfly fever viruses. By using inhibition of viral cytopathic effect in LLC-MK2 cells with both virus strains, the 50% effective dose was 4 to 10 micrograms/ml and the virus rating was 1.3. The Adames strain of PTV infection in mice was established for evaluation of the in vivo antiviral efficacy of ribavirin. The drug was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) twice daily for 5 to 7 days beginning 4 h pre-virus inoculation, 24 h post-virus inoculation, or 36 h post-virus inoculation, with increased survivors, reduced hepatic icterus, reduction of serum glutamic oxalic acid transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic acid transaminase, and inhibition of infectious virus from sera and livers of infected mice. The minimum effective dose was 4.7 mg/kg per day, with a maximum tolerated dose of 75 mg/kg per day. When the same treatment schedule beginning 4 h pre-virus inoculation, 4 h post-virus inoculation, or 24 h post-virus inoculation was used, orally administered ribavirin was effective at doses as low as 6.3 mg/kg per day. Single s.c. ribavirin treatments at doses of 175 to 700 mg/kg administered from 4 to 48 h post-virus inoculation were also effective. No effect was seen when ribavirin was administered s.c. to mice infected intracerebrally with the PTV strain Balliet, even though treatment was begun 36 h before virus exposure.\r"

  ".W": "The susceptibility of Swiss White mice to colonization with Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis was greatly increased when the animals were given 5 mg of streptomycin sulfate per ml in their drinking water. One week after initiation of streptomycin treatment, the mice were challenged orogastrically with graded doses of streptomycin-resistant S. faecalis. The number of S. faecalis cells required to implant the intestinal tract of 50% of untreated mice was 2.9 X 10(9), but was only 4.8 X 10(3) for streptomycin-treated animals. When both groups of mice were challenged orogastrically with 4.6 X 10(6) viable S. faecalis cells, the cecum and small intestine of 100% of the streptomycin-treated animals, but only 10% of the untreated animals, were colonized with the organism. Similarly, translocation of S. faecalis to extraintestinal sites occurred in a majority of streptomycin-treated mice, but in only a small number of untreated mice. Subcutaneous administration of the experimental antibiotic LY146032 (Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, Ind.) to streptomycin-treated mice concomitant with orogastric challenge with 5.5 X 10(5) viable S. faecalis cells resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of intestinal colonization by the organism, a significant reduction in S. faecalis populations, and the absence of the organism in the liver, spleen, and heart. However, once intestinal colonization had occurred and extraintestinal infections were established, LY146032 did not significantly reduce S. faecalis populations or ameliorate the infections. We conclude that LY146032 effectively prevents translocation of S. faecalis from the intestinal tract of mice but does not resolve established extraintestinal infections.\r"

  ".U": "88208610\r", 
  ".W": "Fifty-two patients (29 female and 23 male) with lupuslike anticoagulants were reviewed retrospectively to determine whether their inhibitors were time dependent (TD). In 21 cases (40%), a TD pattern emerged: when patient plasma was added to normal plasma and an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test was performed on the mixture, the patient/control ratio after incubation for one hour at 37 degrees C (60-minute ratio) exceeded significantly the respective preincubation ratio (zero-minute ratio). In four cases (8%), anticoagulant activity would have gone undetected if mixing studies had been restricted to the preincubation phase. The TD anticoagulants appeared to be more potent than their time-independent (TI) counterparts (mean APTT, 74.1 vs 58.5 s, respectively). An APTT greater than 63 s was 85% predictive of TD behavior. Greater overlap between the two groups was seen when zero-minute ratios were compared; an equivalent cutoff of 1.36 for the zero-minute ratio was only 65% predictive of TD behavior. The separation between the two groups was most striking when 60-minute ratios were compared. Nineteen TD patients (90%) had 60-minute ratios that exceeded the mean TI ratio of 1.33, while 30 TI patients (97%) had 60-minute ratios that were lower than the mean TD ratio of 1.89. Collectively, these findings indicate that many potent lupuslike anticoagulants require incubation to express maximal anticoagulant activity. Indeed, in some cases, anticoagulant activity might not be detected if mixing studies are restricted to the preincubation phase. The APTT can be helpful in predicting which anticoagulants will show TD behavior.\r"

All patients demonstrated anemia (hematocrit [mean +/- SEM], 0.29 +/- 0.01 [29.0% +/- 1.0%]) and hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin, 22 +/- 2 g/L [2.2 +/- 0.2 g/dL]) and noted an illness longer than one week. Findings on chest roentgenograms varied from a miliary pattern, misinterpreted as congestive heart failure, to cavitary and noncavitary alveolar infiltrates, misdiagnosed as bacterial pneumonia. Tuberculosis was not considered as a diagnostic possibility on admission in any patient. The mean time from admission until consideration of tuberculosis was 4.7 +/- 1.0 days and the time to diagnosis was 7.2 +/- 1.7 days. In contrast, tuberculosis was considered on admission in 12 patients presenting with undiagnosed active tuberculosis without respiratory failure. We conclude that respiratory failure delays the diagnosis of active tuberculosis by suggesting nontuberculous pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1983, when Congress established the Medicare DRG-based Prospective Payment System (PPS) for inpatient hospital care, rehabilitation hospitals and units that qualify under federal regulations have been exempted from the system. Congress recognized that the DRGs were not designed to consider the specific circumstances of rehabilitation patients. It required the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to report on the feasibility of developing a PPS for rehabilitation (and other excluded) hospitals and units. In October 1987, DHHS released its long-awaited report to Congress on \"Developing a Prospective Payment System for Excluded Hospitals.\" The Report concludes that further research is necessary before DHHS can develop specific legislative and regulatory recommendations. Yet, the report also indicates DHHS' desire ultimately to implement a capitation-based PPS for rehabilitation. Until this goal is achieved, DHHS would like to develop a transitional PPS for rehabilitation. However, given that studies indicate that DRGs are an inappropriate basis for a rehabilitation PPS, and measures that would provide a better basis (eg, functional status or capitation) have not yet been fully developed for purposes of rehabilitation payment, it is uncertain how DHHS will achieve these goals in the short run. Until further studies are conducted, development of a transitional system appears ill-advised. Congress and DHHS should, therefore, continue to exempt rehabilitation hospitals and units until an appropriate payment system for rehabilitation can be developed.\r"

Among 72 subjects who were initially seronegative and who were re-interviewed, four were seropositive at follow-up, for a seroconversion rate of 7% per year among seronegatives. Among seropositive subjects who did not develop AIDS or fatal AIDS related complex (ARC), continued drug injection was associated with rate of T4 cell loss, and there was a non-significant trend for males to lose T4 cells more rapidly than females. While it was not possible to distinguish the mechanism underlying the relationship between continued drug injection and T4 cell loss, seropositive IV drug users should be warned that continued injection may lead to increased HIV-related immunosuppression as well as, if injection equipment is shared, risking viral transmission to others.\r"

Ten of these seropositive contacts were the sexual partners of the index cases. Overall 71% of sexual partners (10:14) were seropositive. By contrast only 2:100 of the non-sexual contacts had evidence of infection. These were the daughter of an index case and her 2-year-old son who were seropositive but had their own independent risk factors. The data presented here support the hypothesis that a major route of transmission of HIV in an African population is through heterosexual contact and furthermore suggest that transmission by other means such as intimate non-sexual contact, insect vectors, or the use of non-sterile needles is much less important.\r"

Thirty-seven (95%) of 38 patients with this eruption and severe weight loss (greater than 10% of normal body weight) were seropositive. The initial skin lesions were small, firm, intensely pruritic papules which released a small drop of clear fluid when scratched. Scratched papules became later hyperpigmented macules. Lesions were symmetrically distributed over the body and were most frequently found on the extensor surfaces of the arm, the dorsal surface of the hands, the inferior part of the legs, the ankles and the dorsum of the feet. Histologic examination showed a non-specific inflammatory reaction. Thirty-three (51%) patients reported that the skin eruption was their initial disease manifestation. In African patients, the presence of an unexplained generalized pruritic papular eruption is highly indicative of HIV infection.\r"

  ".U": "88209289\r", 
  ".W": "Research on the epidemiology of HIV infection among IV drug users is still at a relatively early stage. Multilocation studies that would permit better geographic comparisons are greatly needed. Multi-method studies within single geographic areas are also needed to assess possible biases with respect to sample recruitment and data collection procedures. The continuation of the epidemic provides a changing historical context that complicates any comparisons. Despite these problems, there are some consistencies that can be seen across studies. Studies of HIV seroprevalence among IV drug users show wide variation among cities in the United States and Europe. The time that the virus was introduced into the IV drug using group within the city is one factor in explaining these differences; other cross-city factors have yet to be identified. Once HIV has been introduced into the IV drug use group within a particular geographic area, there is the possibility of rapid spread up to seroprevalence levels of 50% or greater. Thus, a currently low seroprevalence rate should not be seen as a stable situation. Frequency of injection and sharing of equipment with multiple other drug users (particularly at shooting galleries) have been frequently associated with HIV exposure. Being female, ethnicity (in the USA) and engaging in prostitution also may be associated with increased risk for HIV exposure, suggesting that prevention programs should include special consideration of sex and ethnic differences. Studies of AIDS risk reduction show that substantial proportions of IV drug users are changing their behavior to avoid exposure to HIV. This risk reduction is probably more advanced in New York, with its high seroprevalence and incidence of cases, but is also occurring in cities with lower seroprevalence and limited numbers of cases. The primary forms of risk reduction are increasing the use of sterile equipment, reducing the number of needle sharing partners, and reducing the frequency of injection. These behavior changes are very similar to the frequently identified behavioral risk factors associated with HIV exposure, suggesting that they should be effective in at least slowing the spread of HIV among IV drug users. No linkage of risk reduction to decreases in seroconversion has yet been shown, however, and greater risk reduction is clearly required. A variety of prevention strategies will probably be needed to reduce the spread of HIV among IV drug users. Prevention of initiation into drug injection is an undeniable long-term goal for the control of HIV infection, but there is very little research being conducted in this area.\r"

At each visit, the seropositive men exhibited lower CD4 counts, CD4/CD8 ratios, hemoglobin concentrations and lymphocyte counts, and higher C1q binding, IgG and IgA levels. More important, the decline of the CD4/CD8 ratio and the rise of the C1q binding, IgG and IgA, progressed significantly in the seropositive group between visits. Seropositive men were at elevated risk of developing constitutional symptoms and generalized lymphadenopathy. An association was present between development of symptoms and inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. The 11 seropositive men who have progressed to AIDS had lower CD4 counts and CD4/CD8 ratios, and higher C1q binding, IgG and IgA, than 134 seropositive AIDS-free men a mean of 21.4 months prior to diagnosis. The AIDS group demonstrated greater decline between visits in the CD4 count, hemoglobin and white blood count (WBC) than the seropositive AIDS-free group. The present data document the long-term effects of HIV infection in a seropositive cohort and suggest the possibility of a subgroup particularly susceptible to the progressive effects of HIV that precede the development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\r"

  ".W": "The addition of both live and ultraviolet-inactivated preparations of human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and HIV to cultures of human peripheral lymphocytes impeded the ability of these cells to respond to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). This inhibition depended on the concentration of the virus and seemed due, in part at least, to interference with the generation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) activity in the PHA-stimulated cultures. However, the addition of exogenous IL-2 did not effectively restore the lymphocyte proliferative responsiveness of cells which had been co-incubated with these human retroviruses. Exposure to the viruses did not affect expression on co-incubated cells of the Tac antigen, an epitope of the IL-2 receptor, as determined by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. These results suggest that one mechanism through which human retroviruses may be able to impede cellular proliferative responsiveness is interference with the ability of target cells to respond to IL-2, even though IL-2 receptors continue to be expressed under the conditions tested.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the C3b/C4b receptor (CR1) was studied on erythrocytes of 153 individuals infected with HIV and 104 age-matched normal individuals by measuring the uptake of 125I-labelled monoclonal anti-CR1 antibody. The mean number of CR1 sites on erythrocytes of asymptomatic seropositive individuals (822 +/- 270; mean +/- s.d.) and of patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL; 775 +/- 320) did not differ significantly from that of normal subjects. The number was significantly lower in patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC; 543 +/- 233; P less than 5 x 10(-3)) and further decreased in patients with AIDS (442 +/- 271; P less than 1 x 10(-4)), whether they presented with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) or opportunistic infections. An additional finding was that of decreased expression of antigenic and functional CR1 in neutrophils from patients with AIDS, as assessed by radioimmunoassay of CR1 in detergent-solubilized cells and the capacity of intact cells to form rosettes with C3b-coated erythrocytes. Low numbers of CR1 on cells from patients with AIDS were not due to occupation of the receptor by C3 fragments on immune complexes. The correlation that was observed between decreased numbers of CR1 on erythrocytes and clinical subpopulations of symptomatic HIV-infected patients suggests that CR1 expression on erythrocytes may represent a valuable marker of the severity and natural history of HIV-associated disease.\r"

  ".W": "Recently there has been much interest in using immunohistology with monoclonal antibodies (MABs) against different cells of the immune system in lymph nodes (LNs) of patients with HIV infection. The panel of these MABs is becoming increasingly extensive. In this study we report on our finding that by using a limited number of properly chosen MABs, diagnostically and prognostically relevant parameters can be acquired. One hundred and twenty-one LN biopsy specimens from patients with HIV infection were reviewed and classified according to our expanded working classification and a fifth main type of LN lesion, the small lymphocyte follicular type, was added to our earlier classification. We propose that this new type represents a transitional form between the mixed follicular type and the follicular depleted type. In the follicular type of LN lesion there is no marked change in the number of CD4 cells within the follicles and in the extrafollicular parenchyma. The reaction against the major core proteins of HIV is always positive and the number of proliferating cells is very high. The positivity is weaker in the earlier cases and stronger in the older ones. The follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network shows degenerative changes. In the hypervascular follicular type the reaction pattern with these selected MABs is very similar to the one in the follicular type. In the mixed type there are hyperplastic follicles and regressively transformed follicles in the same node. The hyperplastic follicles show a pattern similar to those in the follicular type. However, the reaction with MABs against core proteins of HIV is often markedly stronger. The number of proliferating cells is decreased markedly. Some follicles show extensive FDC network destruction. CD4 cells within the follicles and in the extrafollicular parenchyma are decreased. The regressively transformed follicles contain very few proliferating cells and the reaction with MABs against core proteins is variable, being strong in some follicles and weak in others. The small lymphocyte type contains follicles consisting mainly of small lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are of the same phenotype as those in the primary follicles. In contrast to these, however, the numbers of CD4 and Leu 7+ cells are much decreased. The reaction with MABs to core proteins is weak and limited to the germinal centres (GCs). The number of proliferating cells is strongly diminished. The FDC network, however, is well developed in most follicles. In the follicular depleted LNs there are no follicles; however, in some LNs remnants of FDC can be seen.\r"

The emergence and persistence of BLPB after penicillin therapy may have important implications for the antimicrobial management of infections of the upper respiratory tract.\r"

After adjustment for social background variables the relative risk was reduced to 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 3.2). Among causes of death a strong predominance was found for violent death, suicide or probable suicide being the leading single cause and accounting for 236 (36%) of all deaths. The reported U shaped curve for total mortality was not confirmed, though when violent deaths were excluded a U shaped curve was suggested for other causes of death. These findings provide important epidemiological data on the drinking habits of young people and the consequences for mortality.\r"

  ".W": "The mortality of patients admitted to intensive care units with haematological malignancy is high. A humane approach to the management of the critically ill as well as efficient use of limited resources requires careful selection of those patients who are most likely to benefit from intensive care. To delineate more accurately the factors influencing outcome in these patients the records of 60 consecutive admissions to the intensive care unit (37 male, 23 female) with haematological malignancy were reviewed retrospectively. Fifty patients were in acute respiratory failure, most commonly (34 patients) with a combination of pneumonia and septicaemic shock. The severity of the acute illness was assessed by the APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II) score and number of organ systems affected. Thirteen patients survived to leave hospital. The mortality of patients with haematological malignancy was consistently higher than predicted from a large validation study of APACHE II in a mixed population of critically ill patients. Moreover, no patient with an APACHE II score of greater than 26 survived. Mortality among the 22 patients with relapsed malignancy (21 deaths), was significantly higher than among the 35 patients at first presentation (26 deaths). On discharge from the intensive care unit all survivors had responded well to chemotherapy and had normal or raised peripheral white cell counts. They included seven patients who had recovered from leucopenia (white cell count less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l). In contrast, 36 of the 47 patients who died were leucopenic at the time of death. The overall mortality of critically ill patients with haematological malignancy is higher than equivalently ill patients without cancer. The dysfunction of an increasing number of organ systems, an APACHE II score of greater than 30, failure of the malignancy to respond to chemotherapy, and persistent leucopenia all point to a poor outcome.\r"

The pick up rate of microaneurysms, haemorrhages, and hard and soft (cotton wool spots) exudates was equivalent for Polaroid prints and 35 mm transparencies of equivalent quality. In two cases with disc new vessels, however, these were not seen on the Polaroid prints. The widespread use of Polaroid colour prints obtained with a non-mydriatic camera without the necessary operative and interpretive skills further limits the usefulness of the technique.\r"

The overall incidence of recurrent ulceration was 6% after two years and 11% after five years of follow up. In the refractory group, however, the incidence of recurrent ulceration was 18% at two years and 34% after five years, whereas the incidence of recurrence was only 1.5% at two years and 3% after five years in patients whose ulcers had healed with H2 receptor antagonists. Resistance to H2 receptor antagonists was not related to preoperative basal or peak acid output but was related to cigarette smoking. Factors associated with recurrent ulceration after highly selective vagotomy were basal acid outputs before and after operation, cigarette smoking, and the surgeon who performed the operation. Duodenal ulcers that fail to respond to H2 receptor antagonists represent a more severe ulcer diathesis, for which highly selective vagotomy is less effective.\r"

A questionnaire was used to investigate the attitudes of non-responders, who were all from social classes IV and V. Attendance was found to be inhibited by a high level of anxiety about the test and about cervical cancer, by erroneous beliefs, and by concurrent family difficulties. More than half the non-attendance was directly attributable to administrative errors, which resulted in appointments being sent to wrong addresses or to inappropriate people (four after hysterectomy, 10 who had had recent smears). These matters require urgent attention. Several simple measures might improve attendance at clinics, follow up of patients, and attitudes toward screening: invitations to attend the clinic, a register of patients and results, a simpler version of the leaflet, use of well known personalities to promote cervical screening, health education campaigns, and regular evaluation of records.\r"

Providing this specialist support at home allowed much earlier discharge of low birthweight infants from hospital. When compared with the cost of providing continuing inpatient neonatal care earlier discharge was estimated to have saved roughly pounds 250,000 in 1985. Low birthweight infants have an increased risk of serious illness or death that extends beyond the neonatal period. Many are born to young and socially disadvantaged parents who can benefit from expert guidance and support at home. A community neonatal nursing service has advantages for high risk infants and their parents, is cost effective, and allows more efficient use of limited hospital resources.\r"

  ".U": "88210187\r", 
  ".W": "Based on estrogen receptor (ER) status and menopausal status, operable breast cancer (International Union Against Cancer [UICC] Stage I, II, and III) patients were randomized for adjuvant endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and chemoendocrine therapy, and the effects on the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared. Adjuvant endocrine therapy was composed of tamoxifen (TAM) 20 mg/day orally for 2 years in postmenopausal patients. In premenopausal patients, oophorectomy (OVEX) was done before TAM administration. In the chemotherapy arm, the patients were given 0.06 mg/kg of body weight of mitomycin C (MMC) intravenously (IV) and then an oral administration of cyclophosphamide (CPA) 100 mg/body orally in an administration of a 3-month period and a 3-month intermission. This 6-month schedule was repeated four times in 2 years. As the chemoendocrine therapy arm, TAM with MMC + CPA chemotherapy was added. The patients were randomized according to ER and menopausal status. Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cancer patients were randomized to three arms: TAM +/- OVEX, MMC + CPA, or MMC + CPA + TAM. For estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) patients, there were two arms: MMC + CPA, or MMC + TAM. The study started in September 1978, and 692 patients entered until the end of 1984 were evaluated. The median follow-up was about 46 months. Totally, a 9.8% rate (68/692) of recurrence was noted, a 7.5% rate (52/692) of mortality. There were no significant differences in DFS or OS among the treatment arms in ER+ or ER- patients. There was significant differences in adverse effects such as bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal disturbances, cystitis, hair loss between endocrine therapy and chemotherapy or chemoendocrine therapy groups. In this preliminary study, it was concluded that because of less adverse effects of endocrine therapy, it seems rational to select the operable breast cancer patients by the presence or absence of ER, namely, endocrine therapy for ER+ and chemotherapy for ER- cancer patients.\r"

It is known to modulate testosterone metabolism and may have a prognostic value in determining disease progression. Prolonged treatment with a GnRH analogue has been introduced recently as a therapeutic alternative to surgical castration in advanced prostatic carcinoma. It has been reported that prolactin levels remain unchanged or even decrease in GnRH analogue treatment. By contrast, in this series of 15 prostatic carcinoma patients treated with GnRH analogue, a significant rise was demonstrated in clinical responders as well as nonresponders. In the latter group, prolactin rise was more pronounced. These results suggest that frequent prolactin determinations might be of prognostic value in determining early disease progression under GnRH analogue treatment.\r"

Parenteral nutrition (PN) (nonprotein [NP], 31.4 kcal/kg/d; nitrogen [N], 0.177 g/kg/d) was started on day 6 after the beginning of chemotherapy and continued through all of the cytopenic phase. A clinical and metabolic evaluation, including measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE) by indirect calorimetry, was performed on each patient within the 2 days before beginning chemotherapy (D0), on the third day of chemotherapy (D3), and then weekly from day 7 until the end of the cytopenic phase. Measured REE at day 0 (29.5 +/- 1.4 kcal/kg/d) was significantly higher (+34 +/- 6%) than theoretical REE. Chemotherapy induced a significant decrease in REE at day 3 (26.2 +/- 1.7 kcal/kg/d; P less than 0.05), but during the cytopenic phase REE was not different significantly from its initial values (D0). A positive energy balance was observed during the whole study after the beginning of PN. In contrast, mean nitrogen balance remained negative always, due to a sharp increase in urinary nitrogen loss during the cytopenic phase. The fact that nutritional support falls short of its goal may explain why no improvement in tumor response to therapy has been described in most studies.\r"

Eleven patients had Stage IVA disease; nine patients had Stage IVB disease. Patient compliance with therapy was poor in four of nine patients with Stage IVB disease, and the 50% survival time was 6 months. In Stage IVA disease there were 18% 3-year survivals. For those that failed, the 50% survival time was 7.5 months. Because of the frequency of disseminated metastases, effective adjuvant therapy needs to be developed to use after the tumor debulking therapy, especially for Stage IVB disease. A single early Cf-NT implant followed by 6000 cGy of whole-pelvis fractionated radiation would accomplish this adequately for local tumor control and palliation.\r"

Nine patients had bone pain at the time of the first positive scan and pain developed in two patients 6 months and 2 years later, respectively. The other six patients are still asymptomatic 1 to 4 years later. False-positive scans were found in six other patients. No patient with bone pain had a negative scan.

Clinical manifestations were distributed as follows: cafe-au-lait markings were the most prevalent manifestation (87%), followed by a positive family history (49%), scoliosis (53%), neurofibromata (19%), and pseudarthrosis of the tibia (19%). The classic scoliosis was resistant to brace treatment; bracing failed in 70% of patients, necessitating spinal fusion. Pseudarthrosis of the tibia can be subdivided into normal, narrow sclerotic, and cystic medullary canal groups. This study supported the theory that tibias with narrow sclerotic medullary canals should be prophylactically braced until skeletal maturity to prevent fracture. Once fractured, the incidence of non-union is high regardless of treatment mode. Eighty percent of patients with pseudarthrosis of the tibia did not heal with multiple bone grafts and were amputated below the knee. Many patients in this study were educable or only mildly mentally retarded, and performed quite well in activities of daily living.\r"

The three-stage infusions (0.15 +/- 0.02 mg flecainide acetate/kg/min for 5 minutes, 0.046 +/- 0.004 mg/kg/min for 60 minutes, and 0.31 +/- 0.05 mg/kg/hr for 5 to 47 hours; mean +/- SE) resulted in 95% +/- 0.1% suppression of ventricular ectopic depolarizations. Based on these results, six additional patients received a uniform infusion regimen (0.1 mg/kg/min for 5 minutes, 0.025 mg/kg/min for 2 hours, and 0.25 mg/kg/hr for 46 hours). Supplemental doses of 0.25 mg/kg were given (four doses per patient). With this protocol, ventricular ectopic depolarizations were 82.6% +/- 8.5% suppressed. Measured plasma flecainide concentrations were not significantly different from those predicted by pharmacokinetic models. A prompt and sustained antiarrhythmic effect was obtained with an intravenous regimen of flecainide determined by a prospective pharmacokinetic approach. However, the dosages developed in this study may have to be modified for patients with impaired cardiac or renal function.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis and therapy of the depressive disorders has entered a new era in the 80s. Though primarily driven by breakthroughs in the neurosciences, such as neuroendocrinology, neurochemistry, and psychopharmacology, the increased sophistication of our diagnostic procedures and therapies of these disorders is by no means limited to the biomedical laboratory. A move away from preconceived concepts of the causes and course of depression has ushered in an era of empirical investigation of the clinical presentation and clinical course of the depressive disorders. This empirical approach has contributed to a new wave of epidemiologic investigations. The psychiatrist's diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the depressive disorders, more so than with any other primary psychiatric disorder, closely parallels the approach of physicians from other specialties, and has thereby increased the bond between psychiatry and the other medical specialties. Some caution, however, must be expressed. First, depressive disorders are considered by many primary care physicians to be easily understood and managed, or to be unworthy of serious attention. The requirement for specialty care in the management of treatment-resistant depressive disorders is as essential as the requirement for the coronary care unit in treating the unstable cardiac patient. In addition, the movement toward the medical management of the depressive disorders should not bias the clinician to the point that he neglects these illnesses and the patients who suffer them. We may view the depressive disorders as being primarily of biomedical causes, but patients still interpret their depressive symptoms within the context of their values, their lifestyles, and the events that impact them.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Chemosensitivity was determined to be positive when the succinate dehydrogenase (SD) activity of the drug-exposed cells, at ten times the peak plasma concentration, was decreased to below 50 percent of that of control cells on day 3 of exposure. Decrease in SD activity was remarkable in cases of exposure to HCFU, compared with six other drugs. The sensitivity rates were 32 percent for CQ, 40 percent for ADM, 24 percent for MMC, 28 percent for ACR, 32 percent for DDP, 16 percent for 5-FU, and 68 percent for HCFU. The sensitivity rate for at least one of the six drugs (CQ, ADM, MMC, ACR, DDP, and 5-FU) was 52 percent, but was 80 percent when HCFU was taken into account. Since colorectal cancer tissues are resistant to various antitumor drugs, the chemosensitivity test of HCFU should aid in determining the effects of a particular drug for an individual patient.\r"

To examine the practicality of using critical care nurses to initiate injury scoring within the first 24 hours of admission, a prospective study was undertaken. Nurses on the trauma intensive care unit were asked to calculate the ISS in patients admitted to the unit over a 4-month period. Scoring was completed within 24 hours of admission and recorded on an edited single-page chart constructed from the 1980 revision of the AIS. All patients were followed up until discharge, and the ISS was reviewed in the light of discharge diagnoses. One hundred four patients were studied, and accurate scores were calculated in 54 patients (51.9%). In three patients (2.9%) the single-page chart did not allow accurate scoring, and in 18 patients (17.3%) the diagnoses noted subsequent to the scoring time frame resulted in inaccuracy. Human errors resulted in inaccuracy in 28% of patients. In comparison with a concurrent study involving surgical residents, human error rates were similar. However, scoring within 24 hours, as opposed to 72 hours, resulted in significantly more errors related to diagnostic uncertainty. Initiation of the scoring process soon after admission, with subsequent correction during the hospital course, allows important information to be available at the earliest time.\r"

The mathematical model used was a numerical solution of the classic airway convention-diffusion equation with the addition of a distributed source term at the alveolar end. In the human studies, a static sampling technique was used to measure the exhaled concentrations and phase III slopes of CO2, He, and SF6 during the intravenous infusion of saline saturated with a mixture of the two inert gases. We found good agreement between the experimentally determined normalized slopes (phase III slope divided by mixed expired concentration) and the numerically determined normalized slopes in the model with no free parameters other than the physiological ones of upper airway dead space, tidal volume, breathing frequency, and breathing pattern (sinusoidal). We conclude 1) that the single-path (Weibel) trumpet-bell anatomic model used in conjunction with the airway convection-diffusion equation with a distributed source term is adequate to describe the steady-state lung washout of CO2 and infused He and SF6 in normal lungs and 2) that the interfacial area separating the tidal volume fron from the functional residual capacity gas, through which gas diffusion into the moving tidal volume occurs, exerts a major effect on the normalized slopes of phase III.\r"

We determined the acute and sustained (4 min) ventilatory response to a range of external inspiratory resistive loads (4, 8, 12, and 25 cmH2O.l-1.s) during wakefulness and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in seven normal men. We found that minute ventilation (VI) was well maintained with acute and sustained resistive loading during wakefulness. Immediate adjustments in ventilatory timing (prolongation of inspiratory duration) provided full compensation for airflow reduction. In marked contrast, resistive load application during NREM sleep invariably produced a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in VI with progressively larger resistive loads producing progressively greater ventilatory decrements. This decline in ventilation was a product of a falling inspiratory flow rate with inadequate prolongation of inspiratory duration (TI). The largest decrements in ventilation occurred immediately after load application followed by partial ventilatory recovery, which occurred over time in concert with rising PCO2 and augmented ventilatory effort (as reflected by P0.1 or mouth occlusion pressure). Similar observations were made during REM sleep, although the responses were less consistent and fewer data were obtained. These observations support the hypothesis that poor load compensation for increased upper airway resistance contributes to the hypoventilation characteristic of normal sleep.\r"

Seven dogs were ventilated with a driving pressure of 10 psi at rates of 2 and 5 Hz for each of three mechanical loads: control, thoracoabdominal wrap, and histamine infusion. Both load conditions reduced total expired volume and entrained volume but had no effect on jet volume. Wrap reduced entrainment more at 2 Hz while the effect of histamine infusion was frequency independent. Control arterial blood gases demonstrated that PO2 was higher and PCO2 was lower during 2 Hz ventilation than during 5 Hz ventilation despite equivalent minute volumes. Five additional dogs were studied using control and wrap loads and an additional ventilator setting of 15 psi at 5 Hz. This group demonstrated that wrap reduces entrainment more at lower frequencies for ventilatory settings providing equivalent gas exchange. We conclude that increasing mechanical load reduces entrainment during HFJV and that this reduction is frequency dependent for restrictive loads.\r"

Ratings of perceived exercise (RPE) for breathlessness and leg effort were evaluated each minute by means of a modified Borg scale during both the IET and a 12-min single-stage exercise test (SST) performed at approximately 70% of the maximal exercise capacity. The trained group showed a significant increase in the MSVC, from 71.9 +/- 26.4 to 86.9 +/- 20.9 l/min (P less than 0.01), whereas the control group showed no change (66.3 +/- 22.5 to 65.1 +/- 22.1 l/min).

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of leukotrienes in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, we measured steady-state pressor responses to graded hypoxia in isolated ferret lungs perfused with autologous blood containing 0.001, 0.03, 1, or 3 mM nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), 1 mM BW 755C, or 0.02-0.05 mM indomethacin. Untreated lungs served as controls. Perfusate concentrations of thromboxane B2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, measured by radioimmunoassay, were markedly reduced in all treated lungs, indicating inhibition of cyclooxygenase. The maximum pressor response to hypoxia measured at a blood flow of 50 ml.min-1. kg-1 averaged 26.6 +/- 2.4 Torr in untreated lungs and was not affected by BW 755C or 0.001-0.03 mM NDGA. Because BW 755C and NDGA inhibited cyclooxygenase at concentrations that did not affect hypoxic vasoconstriction and because both agents are thought to inhibit lipoxygenase with a potency greater than or equal to that with which they inhibit cyclooxygenase, these results do not support the possibility that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction was mediated by leukotrienes. At concentrations of 1 and 3 mM, NDGA inhibited the maximum hypoxic pressor response by 57 and 95%, respectively. The mechanism of this attenuation is unknown; however, it was apparently not due to cyclooxygenase inhibition, since indomethacin enhanced the maximum hypoxic pressor response by 45%. Nor was it due to blockade of calcium entry or interference with the contractile process in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, since 1 mM NDGA did not inhibit vasoconstrictor responses to KCl or prostaglandin F2 alpha.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of moderate (30-50 Torr arterial PO2) and severe (less than 30 Torr arterial PO2) hypoxia to generate endogenous opioids that modulate ventilation was studied in unanesthetized goats. Ventilation and its components, arterial blood gas tensions and pH, and plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-endorphin activity were measured before and after 4 h of sustained moderate or severe hypoxia. Ventilation, as expected, increased with hypoxia. There were no significant changes in either plasma or CSF beta-endorphin activity after sustained hypoxia. To rule out elaboration of endogenous opioids other than beta-endorphin after hypoxia, naloxone or saline was administered to five of the seven goats exposed to 4 h of severe hypoxia, and their ventilatory responses were compared for 30 additional min of hypoxic breathing. No significant differences in ventilation occurred in the two treatment groups during this time period. We conclude that, unlike increases in airway resistance, moderate and severe hypoxia do not cause the elaboration of endogenous opioids that modify respiratory output in unanesthetized adult goats. The apparent ability of hypoxia to cause elaboration of endogenous opioids in the neonate may represent a maturational phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "We studied breathing and behavioral response to increased arterial CO2 (PaCO2) in 12 fetal sheep between 130 and 145 days of gestation. Of these 12 fetuses, 10 had an increase in PaCO2 through maternal rebreathing of CO2; in the other 2 fetuses CO2 was increased via an endotracheal tube and application of continuous distending airway pressure. We used our window technique to observe and videotape fetal behavior. The experiments consisted of recording breathing activity and behavior during resting conditions (1 low- and high-voltage ECoG cycle) and during administration of CO2. We measured electrocortical activity (ECoG), eye movements (EOG), electromyography of the diaphragm (EMGdi) and neck muscles, tracheal (Ptr), amniotic, and carotid arterial pressures. Administration of CO2 by the rebreathing technique produced an increase in the amplitude of breathing activity as reflected by an increase in Ptr from 5.0 +/- 0.6 to 12 +/- 1.9 mmHg (P less than 0.01) and an increase in SEMGdi from 32 +/- 4 to 77 +/- 8% max (P less than 0.001). Frequency increased due to a decrease in inspiratory (TI) and expiratory duration. Ptr/TI increased from 11.0 +/- 2.0 to 37.4 +/- 9.0 mmHg/s (P less than 0.05) and SEMGdi/TI increased from 67 +/- 7 to 221 +/- 28% max/s (P less than 0.001). Although the response was at times prolonged into the transitional high-voltage zone, it did not persist during established high-voltage ECoG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the clearance and early hydrolysis of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in vivo. Radiolabeled ANF was cleared from the circulation of the rat with biphasic kinetics; the majority (90%) of ANF cleared with a t1/2 of 15 s, the remaining peptide was cleared with a t1/2 of 5 min. Microsequence analysis of ANF peptides recovered from the circulation of rats revealed five major degradation products of the intact hormone. The first cleavage occurred between amino acids 12 and 13 of the hormone and would inactivate ANF. Over time, additional fragments of the hormone were generated, including fragments of 6, 7, 21, and 24 amino acids in length. Whole body radioautography of rats injected with [123I]-ANF revealed the kidney as a predominant organ involved in clearance of ANF. Subsequent amino acid sequence analyses of radiolabeled ANF exposed to the kidney in vivo indicated that this organ generated four of the five major hydrolysis products observed in circulation, namely, the 6, 7, 16, and 21 amino acid fragments of the hormone. In an attempt to stabilize ANF in vivo, a synthetic analogue of the hormone was prepared that contained the amino acid analogue, aminoisobutyric acid, substituted at position 13. This analogue completely abolished the in vivo cleavage of ANF at this site. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of a protein chemistry approach in characterizing hormone metabolism in vivo and designing analogues with enhanced in vivo stability to cleavage.\r"

Agents have been identified which stimulate the adherence of purified basophils to cultured human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HuVEC). Treatment of HuVEC with interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), bacterial endotoxin, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) resulted in time and dose-dependent increases of adhesiveness for basophils. Coincubation of basophils and HuVEC for 10 min with C5a, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, the calcium ionophore A23187, platelet-activating factor, TNF, and TPA also resulted in significant dose-dependent increases in basophil adherence; this effect resulted from activation of the basophil. Adherence of basophils to HuVEC was time and temperature dependent, required divalent cations, and was unaffected by glucocorticoids. Monoclonal antibody 60.3, directed against the beta-subunit of the leukocyte adherence complex CD18, inhibited the binding of basophils to HuVEC. Adherence of basophils to vascular endothelium may be important in initiating basophil infiltrates in vivo.\r"

The anti-CMV antibody does not have RF activity and does not express the Wa idiotype. The Wa RFs do not have anti-CMV activity. A subset of Wa RFs, however, and the anti-CMV antibody do share several idiotypes on the VHIa and VKIIIb polypeptides. Since there are major differences in the antigen binding characteristics and some of the other expressed idiotypes, these data suggest that the D and J region amino acids are crucial to such specificities. Although the use of such highly homologous gene segments in different immune responses is well-documented in murine systems, these data represent the first such example in the human.\r"

We found that gerbils subjected to temporary unilateral carotid artery occlusion (ischemia) consistently developed neurologic deficits during ischemia with severities that correlated with increasing degrees of brain edema and brain H2O2 levels after reperfusion. In contrast, gerbils treated just before reperfusion (after ischemia) with dimethylthiourea (DMTU), but not urea, had decreased brain edema and brain H2O2 levels. In addition, gerbils fed a tungsten-rich diet for 4, 5, or 6 wk developed progressive decreases in brain xanthine oxidase (XO) and brain XO + xanthine dehydrogenase (XD) activities, brain edema, and brain H2O2 levels after temporary unilateral carotid artery occlusion and reperfusion. In contrast to tungsten-treated gerbils, allopurinol-treated gerbils did not have statistically significant decreases in brain XO or XO + XD levels, and reduced brain edema and brain H2O2 levels occurred only in gerbils developing mild but not severe neurologic deficits during ischemia. Finally, gerbils treated with DMTU or tungsten all survived, while greater than 60% of gerbils treated with urea, allopurinol, or saline died by 48 h after temporary unilateral carotid artery occlusion and reperfusion. Our findings indicate that H2O2 from XO contributes to reperfusion-induced edema in brains subjected to temporary ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Although muscle is considered to be the most important site for postprandial glucose disposal, the metabolic fate of oral glucose taken up by muscle remains unclear. We, therefore, employed the dual isotope technique (intravenous, [6-3H]-glucose; oral, [1-14C]glucose), indirect calorimetry, and forearm balance measurements of glucose, lactate, alanine, pyruvate, O2, and CO2 in nine normal volunteers to determine the relative importance of muscle glycogenic, glycolytic, and oxidative pathways in disposal of an oral glucose load. During the 5 h after glucose ingestion (1 g/kg), 37 +/- 3% (24.9 +/- 2.3 g) of the load was oxidized and 63 +/- 3% (42.8 +/- 2.7 g) was stored. At least 29% (19.4 +/- 1.3 g) was taken up by splanchnic tissues. Muscle took up 26% (17.9 +/- 2.9 g) of the oral glucose coincident with a 50% reduction in its oxidation of fat. 15% of the oral glucose taken up by muscle (2.5 +/- 0.9 g) was released as lactate, alanine, or pyruvate; 50% (8.9 +/- 1.4 g) was oxidized, and 35% (6.4 +/- 2.3 g) was available for storage. We conclude that muscle and splanchnic tissues take up a comparable percentage of an oral glucose load and that oxidation is the predominant fate of glucose taken up by muscle, with storage in muscle accounting for less than 10% of the oral load. Thus, contrary to the prevailing view, muscle is neither the major site of storage nor the predominant site of disposal of an oral glucose load.\r"

  ".U": "88213709\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and elevation of intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca++]i) result from phosphatidylinositol biphosphate (PIP2) breakdown. We previously demonstrated that PKC activation inhibits arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced osmotic water flow in rabbit cortical collecting tubule (CCT) perfused in vitro at 37 degrees C. To estimate the potential significance of PIP2 turnover as a modulator of water transport in this nephron segment, we examined the effect of Ca on AVP action and explored the mechanisms of action of PKC and increased [Ca++]i. In rabbit CCTs perfused at 37 degrees C, pretreatment with bath A23187 (2 x 10(-8) M, 2 x 10(-6) M), a Ca ionophore, almost totally suppressed AVP (10 microU/ml)-induced peak hydraulic conductivity (Lp). The suppression by 2 x 10(-8) M A23187 was as potent as that by 2 x 10(-6) M A23187, and significant even when it was administered 10 min after AVP. When phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 10(-9) M), a PKC activator, and A23187 (2 x 10(-8) M) were placed in the bath simultaneously, the combined suppressive effect on peak Lp was greater than that of either inhibitor alone. However, the mechanisms of inhibition by PMA and A23187 were different. While both 10(-7) and 10(-9) M PMA suppression are primarily post-cAMP, A23187 predominantly suppressed a pre-cAMP step: 10(-4) M chlorophenylthio-cAMP-induced peak Lp was not affected by 2 x 10(-8) M A23187, and only partially inhibited by 2 x 10(-6) M A23187. The PMA (10(-7) M) suppression of AVP-induced peak Lp was totally reversed by bath staurosporine (10(-7) M), a PKC inhibitor, but not attenuated by either bath indomethacin (5 x 10(-6) M) or low Ca (1-2 x 10(-6) M) bath medium. In contrast, the A23187 (2 x 10(-8) M) suppression of the peak Lp was not affected by staurosporine, but was significantly reversed by indomethacin or low Ca bath medium. We conclude: (a) Elevation of [Ca++]i, as well as activation of PKC, suppresses the hydroosmotic effect of AVP on CCT at 37 degrees C. (b) When stimulated simultaneously these two intracellular mediators are additive in their antagonism of AVP action. These results suggest that stimulated PIP2 breakdown may be an important modulator of water transport in CCT. (c) Different mechanisms underlie PKC and Ca-mediated suppression of the AVP-induced water transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In this study the immunostimulatory function of the HLA class II expressing thyroid follicular cells derived from patients with nontoxic goiter and with Graves' disease was compared by assessing their capacity to stimulate allogeneic and autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as cultured intrathyriodal T lymphocytes. Proliferation of allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells was stimulated by thyroid follicular cells from both nontoxic goiter and Graves' disease thyroids, thus demonstrating that thyroid follicular cells from both disorders are capable of presenting alloantigens. In contrast the proliferation of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells was more efficiently stimulated by thyroid follicular cells from Graves' disease than from nontoxic goiter. Cultured intrathyroidal T lymphocytes proliferated specifically in response to autologous HLA class II+ thyroid follicular cells in Graves' disease, but not in nontoxic goiter. The responses were dose dependent and HLA class II restricted. Thyroid autoantigen presentation by HLA class II expressing thyroid follicular cells thus only occurs in Graves' disease, suggesting that HLA class II expression on thyroid follicular cells is an essential feature, but by itself not sufficient for the induction of autoimmunity. Additional factors, the possible nature of which is discussed must also be involved.\r"

Intestinal apo AI and AIV mRNA concentrations were decreased by the atherogenic diet, but apo AI and AIV synthesis was increased in vitro (organ explants) and in vivo (polysome runoff), consistent with regulation at the translational level. In contrast, hepatic apo E mRNA concentration and synthesis were increased after the atherogenic diet, consistent with pretranslational regulation. The response to cholesterol feeding for hepatic apo AI and E showed a third pattern of regulation, in which synthesis increased and mRNA content remained stable or fell, again suggesting translational control, but polysome runoff synthesis was unchanged. The apparent importance of translational regulation in the intestine is consistent with the necessity for the tissue to respond rapidly to changes in intraluminal content.\r"

Indeed, the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor and the vasoconstrictor hormones are often simultaneously elevated in these patients. It is not known, however, whether atrial natriuretic factor remains responsive to sudden reductions in atrial pressure in patients with chronic heart failure, or is unresponsive like the vasoconstrictor systems. To examine this issue, the plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor and the vasoconstrictor hormones were measured in 20 normal subjects and 12 patients with chronic congestive heart failure during incremental lower body negative pressure, an intervention that lowers atrial pressure. In the normal subjects, incremental lower body negative pressure at -10, -20 and -40 mm Hg decreased central venous pressure and pulse pressure. At maximal lower body negative pressure, plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels decreased from 51 +/- 5 to 27 +/- 3 pg/ml (p less than 0.01), whereas increases occurred in plasma levels of norepinephrine (194 +/- 11 to 385 +/- 70 pg/ml, p less than 0.01), renin activity (1.4 +/- 0.2 to 3.9 +/- 0.1 ng/ml per h, p less than 0.01) and vasopressin (1.3 +/- 0.1 to 6.4 +/- 2.4 pg/ml, p less than 0.05). In the patients with congestive heart failure, lower body negative pressure also reduced central venous pressure. Baseline plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels were markedly elevated, averaging 438 +/- 138 pg/ml, and decreased to 317 +/- 87 pg/ml at maximal lower body negative pressure (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The adaptation of the secretory rate of atrial natriuretic factor to repeated adequate stimuli and the influence of the calcium antagonist verapamil on the release of atrial natriuretic factor were investigated in 16 patients. In eight patients (Group 1) right atrial pressure was abruptly increased by rapid right ventricular pacing for 4 min (stimulation I). After a 15 min interval, the identical stimulation was repeated (stimulation II). Eight patients (Group 2) underwent the same protocol but received 5 mg of verapamil intravenously after stimulation I. Pacing increased right atrial pressure in both groups identically by 70%. In Group 1, release of atrial natriuretic factor caused by the second stimulation (median 290 pg/ml over basal) was significantly (2.5-fold) larger than atrial natriuretic factor release induced by the first stimulation (median 116 pg/ml over basal). In the verapamil-treated patients (Group 2), the effect of right atrial pressure increase on release of atrial natriuretic factor was abolished after stimulation II. In both groups, changes in plasma concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate corresponded to changes in atrial natriuretic factor concentrations. Thus, the myoendocrine cells are apparently capable of a fast upward regulation of their response to repeated secretory stimuli. Verapamil appears to block the stimulatory effect of a sudden increase in right atrial pressure upon release of atrial natriuretic factor.\r"

  ".W": "The internal mammary artery is a dynamic conduit used for myocardial revascularization in which potential exists for spasm as well as for vasodilation. This study investigated vasodilator drug effects on the mammary artery using nitroprusside and nitroglycerin in vitro to measure the inhibition of contraction of human internal mammary artery and in vivo to examine blood flow through a canine mammary artery. In the in vitro study, ring segments of human internal mammary arteries were suspended on strain gauges in muscle baths containing 37 degrees C Krebs solution for measurement of isometric tension in vitro. Arterial contraction was stimulated with 70 mM potassium and 10 microM norepinephrine, and inhibition of contraction by vasodilators was measured. Nitroprusside was more potent and effective than was nitroglycerin in inhibiting potassium and norepinephrine contraction. The in vivo study utilized a canine (n = 8) right heart bypass preparation that allowed precise control of cardiac output, blood pressure and heart rate, which were maintained constant. The internal mammary artery graft and the saphenous vein graft perfused the same coronary artery bed. Electromagnetic flow probes measured graft flow (with the other graft occluded) before and after 15 min of drug infusion (1 microgram/kg per min). Nitroglycerin significantly increased mammary artery flow 36 +/- 13%, whereas nitroprusside significantly decreased it 12 +/- 2%. Saphenous vein grafts responded differently; graft blood flow decreased with nitroglycerin and increased with nitroprusside. Thus, although nitroprusside was more effective than nitroglycerin in inhibiting mammary artery contraction in vitro, it decreased internal mammary artery graft flow measured in vivo. Nitroglycerin had the opposite effect, increasing mammary graft flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The addition of streptokinase to platelet-rich plasma from the patient initiated platelet aggregation and secretion in vitro. Platelet aggregation was also seen in 1 of 15 control subjects after the addition of streptokinase, and the addition of plasma or immunoglobulin G (IgG) from the index patient supported platelet aggregation in the presence of streptokinase in all of the previously nonreactive control subjects. This in vitro platelet aggregation was specific for streptokinase and not initiated by either urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator. Streptokinase-induced platelet aggregation was not inhibited by aprotinin, but was completely attenuated by the addition of an excess of antihuman IgG Fab. These findings suggest that streptokinase can initiate specific antibody-mediated platelet aggregation in vitro and may be more than coincidentally related to clot propagation or thromboembolism in vivo.\r"

In this group the mean estradiol and progesterone levels were elevated in the early luteal phase. Despite the elevated initial values, progesterone levels fell rapidly at the mid luteal phase as a sign of premature luteolysis. The mean total amount of gonadotropin administered and the mean number of follicles punctured and of oocytes recovered did not show any significant difference between the groups of normal and short luteal phases. The present findings support the theory that hyperestrogenism in the early luteal phase may initiate the premature luteolysis observed in clomiphene-menopausal gonadotropin-stimulated cycles.\r"

All QD patients were begun on 2 ampoules of hMG, and BID patients on 2 ampoules twice daily. Individual patient responses to hMG determined subsequent doses so as to achieve continuously rising estradiol levels. The BID stimulation scheme appears to increase statistically characteristics that would be present in the ideal stimulated cycle such as elevated follicular-phase estradiol (E2) (2125 pg/ml for the BID vs 1581 pg/ml for the QD group) with an increase in the number of patients achieving the \"desired\" Jones pattern, increased oocyte retrieval (4.01 vs 2.45), and an increase in the number of transferred concepti (2.69 vs 1.87). No statistical differences were noted in the number of endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) surges or mean LH. The luteal phase does not appear to have been altered by the frequency of administration. Although the increase in the total (20.0 vs 14.5%) and live-born/ongoing (16.9 vs 11.8%) pregnancy rate per laparoscopy with the BID regimen is not statistically significant, it may be that it is clinically relevant.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of neurofilament (NF) proteins was examined in the surgical specimen from a 42-year-old woman with Lhermitte-Duclos disease. Hypertrophic granule cell neurons of the dysplastic tissues were reactive with monoclonal antibodies, including antibodies to each of the three human NF subunits. Furthermore, antibodies to dephosphorylation-dependent epitopes on NF proteins stained the cell bodies of hypertrophic granule cells, whereas antibodies to phosphorylation-dependent epitopes stained the enlarged and myelinated axons of the hypertrophic granule cells. Enzymatic dephosphorylation of this tissue abolished axonal staining with phosphorylation-dependent antibodies and uncovered determinants recognized by antibodies to the dephosphorylated state of NF proteins. The NF protein immunoreactivity of hypertrophic granule cells was indistinguishable from that of large, NF-rich neurons in control human cerebellum, suggesting that a normal pattern of expression and phosphorylation of NF proteins occurs in hypertrophic granule cells in Lhermitte-Duclos disease. An increased expression of NF proteins by cerebellar granule cells may account for many of the observed alterations of Lhermitte-Duclos disease, including the hypertrophy of the granule cells and enlargement of their axons, leading to the myelination of parallel fibers within the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Attention should now be directed at the underlying mechanisms which lead to the coordinated up-regulation of the three NF genes and whether or not additional gene products or cell types are altered in Lhermitte-Duclos disease.\r"

The striking neuropathological change was a marked atrophy of the cerebellum, where Purkinje cells were predominantly involved. Loss of Purkinje cells started at the age of six wk before the cerebellar signs had become evident clinically. The cell loss appeared to be more marked in the vermis than in the hemispheres. Cytoplasmic inclusions in most cells consisted of myelin figures composed of concentric membranous lamellae. These inclusions were found mainly in the Purkinje cells at an early stage; thereafter, they were widely distributed in the granule cells, Golgi cells, some glial cells, macrophages and endothelial cells. The neuronal inclusions were frequently located in the vicinity of the Golgi apparatus; there were no unusual mitochondrial configurations. The clinicopathological characteristics of the mutant mice are similar to those of the human Niemann-Pick disease type C.\r"

Nine of the 43 have had 12 pregnancies, resulting in eight live births, and two elective and two spontaneous abortions. All eight children are normal. Nine of 144 women transplanted for leukemia following 120 mg/kg CY and 9.20 to 15.75 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) recovered ovarian function. Two of these nine have had three pregnancies, resulting in two spontaneous and one elective abortion. The probability of having ovarian failure was 0.35 by 7 years for patients receiving CY alone and was 1.00 at 1 year for patients receiving CY plus TBI (P less than .0001). By 7 years after transplant the probabilities of having normal ovarian function were 0.92 after CY alone and 0.24 after CY plus TBI (P less than .0001). Multivariate analysis showed that TBI was the only factor significantly influencing ovarian failure and that both TBI and greater patient age at transplant were significantly associated with a decreased probability of recovering normal ovarian function. These data demonstrate that after high-dose CY, recovery of ovarian function occurs in younger women and in a minority of older women, but after CY and TBI, recovery occurs in only a few younger women and none of the older women.\r"

The effect of pretreatment with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) on the concentration-response curves of GTN and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) for cyclic GMP accumulation in intact cells and activation of guanylate cyclase in broken cell preparations was measured. Pretreatment of cells with 1 microM GTN for 3 h decreased cyclic GMP accumulation induced by GTN but had no effect on SNP-induced cyclic GMP accumulation. Pretreatment of cells with 100 microM GTN decreased the efficacy of GTN and SNP for cyclic GMP elevation by 89% and 40%, respectively. In contrast to results obtained with GTN, SNP slightly desensitized cyclic GMP accumulation induced by GTN and SNP. Pretreatment of cells with 100 nM atrial natriuretic peptide resulted in a 44% decrease in cyclic GMP accumulation induced by subsequent exposure to 10 nM atrial natriuretic peptide but had no effect on cyclic GMP elevation induced by nitrovasodilators. In experiments with crude preparations of soluble guanylate cyclase from cells pretreated with 1 mM GTN, activation of the enzyme by GTN and SNP was inhibited almost completely. Tolerance to GTN in intact cells could not be reversed by subsequent incubation with thiols such as cysteine, N-acetylcysteine or glutathione. However, overnight incubation of GTN-tolerant cells in media without added thiols resulted in complete recovery of responsiveness to GTN. Recovery of GTN-induced cyclic GMP accumulation was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by cycloheximide, suggesting that reversal of organic nitrate tolerance requires de novo synthesis of gyanylate cyclase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In kidneys perfused with Tyrode's solution containing low K+ solution (0.54 mM), ouabain (10(-4) M) enhanced tritium efflux markedly by about 20-fold at 30 min. Depletion of Na+ from the perfusion medium also produced an increase in tritium overflow which peaked at 20 min. Administration of tetrodotoxin (0.3 microM) inhibited the effect of ouabain, but not that of Na+ depletion, to increase tritium efflux and perfusion pressure. In contrast, amiloride (180 microM) enhanced the overflow of tritium elicited by ouabain but failed to alter that elicited by Na+ depletion. The rise in perfusion pressure caused by both stimuli was attenuated by amiloride. Omission of Ca++ (1.8 mM) from the perfusion medium inhibited the increase in tritium efflux and perfusion pressure elicited by ouabain and Na+ depletion by 80 and 65%, respectively. The Ca++ channel blockers omega-conotoxin (50 nM), diltiazem (60 microM) and flunarizine (2 microM), but not nifedipine (1.4 microM), inhibited tritium overflow elicited by ouabain. However, nifedipine, diltiazem and flunarizine, but not omega-conotoxin attenuated the tritium overflow elicited by Na+ depletion. The rise in perfusion pressure elicited by ouabain in low K+ and Na+ depletion was inhibited by these Ca++ channel blockers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, a wide range of doses of the novel H1 antagonists AHR 11325 (1.0-30.0 mg/kg), astemizole (up to 10.0 mg/kg) and loratadine (up to 17.0 mg/kg) usually had little effect on responding, although decreases in response rate accompanied by emesis were observed after the highest doses in some monkeys.

The dopamine uptake inhibitors cocaine (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) and bupropion (0.1-10.0 mg/kg) had behavioral effects similar to those of chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, pyrilamine and tripelennamine, whereas the muscarinic antagonist atropine (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine/5-hydroxytryptamine antagonist cyproheptadine (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), the norepinephrine uptake inhibitor desmethylimipramine (0.03-3.0 mg/kg) and the benzodiazepine diazepam (0.3-30.0 mg/kg) produced only dose-related decreases in response rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Daily cocaine injection into rodents produces a progressive increase in the motor stimulant effect of acute cocaine administration. In this study it was found that daily cocaine injection (15 mg/kg i.p. x 3 days) produced an enhanced motor stimulant response to acute cocaine injection. The behavioral augmentation was linear with regards to dose in horizontal activity and behavioral intensity rating, but was biphasic in vertical activity. Augmented vertical, but not horizontal, activity in response to acute cocaine was found to persist for 2 weeks after the last daily injection of cocaine. Acute injection of cocaine was found to significantly decrease the level of dopamine (DA) metabolites in the nucleus accumbens, striatum and A10 DA region. In rats pretreated with daily injections of cocaine (15 mg/kg i.p. x 3 days), an acute challenge of cocaine 14 days after the last daily injection produced a more consistent decrease in DA metabolites in the nucleus accumbens, striatum and prefrontal cortex compared to daily saline-pretreated rats. In contrast, daily cocaine treatment abolished the decrease in DA metabolites produced in the A10 region by an acute cocaine challenge. Acute injection with cocaine was found to significantly depress dopa accumulation in the A10 region, nucleus accumbens and striatum. This effect was abolished in the A10 region in rats pretreated 14 days previously with daily injections of cocaine (7.5, 15.0 or 30 mg/kg i.p. x 3 days), but remained intact in the nucleus accumbens and striatum, except after daily pretreatment with the highest dose of cocaine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of varying extracellular Ca++ concentration and various antioxidants and metal ion chelators on the viability of isolated rat hepatocytes incubated under 95% O2-5% CO2 was evaluated. Decreasing the extracellular Ca++ concentration from 2 mM to 50 microM or less resulted in a progressive increase in cell injury as determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage. The generation of an oxidative stress, indicated by malondialdehyde formation, occurred before and concomitant with LDH leakage. The antioxidants vitamin E, N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenyl-enediamine, chlorpromazine and promethazine, as well as the iron chelators desferrioxamine and EDTA, all prevented both malondialdehyde production and LDH leakage induced by the absence of extracellular Ca++. A marked loss of cytosolic and mitochondrial glutathione was observed in cells incubated without Ca++, which could be significantly prevented by antioxidants and iron chelators. Similar effects on hepatocyte vitamin E levels also were noted. Addition of the Ca++ chelator ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid to the incubation medium totally prevented LDH leakage and malondialdehyde production and partially ameliorated glutathione and vitamin E loss. Conversely, cell injury resulting from disrupted cellular Ca++ homeostasis after treatment with the Ca++ ionophore A23187 plus 2 mM Ca++ was only slightly inhibited by antioxidants and iron chelators. However, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid also prevented A23187-induced cell injury. These results indicate that a decrease in extracellular Ca++ generates an oxidative stress in hepatocytes which leads ultimately to severe cell injury. This oxidative stress appears to be a Ca++-dependent phenomenon, precipitating all toxicity by a mechanism distinct from that induced by A23187 treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that hypovolemia secondary to extensive blood loss alters the functionality of the central nervous system and is associated with changes in the dose requirements or intensity of action of various central nervous system depressants, including a benzodiazepine. To investigate the mechanism(s) of this effect, the influence of experimental hypovolemia on the pharmacodynamics, receptor binding and pharmacokinetics of a benzodiazepine drug was determined. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were made hypovolemic by removal of about 30% of their blood over 30 min. An i.v. infusion of desmethyldiazepam (DDZP) was started 30 min later and continued until the animals lost their righting reflex. Compared to results obtained with normal controls, the hypovolemic rats required about one-half the dose of DDZP to produce loss of righting reflex and had significantly lower DDZP concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid at that time. This effect of substantial blood removal could not be reversed by prompt return of the removed blood to the animals. Experimental hypovolemia had no apparent effect on the in vitro binding of tritiated diazepam to benzodiazepine receptor sites in the cerebral cortex of rats. The plasma clearance of DDZP was decreased significantly and the biological half-life was increased in hypovolemic rats compared to normal animals when both received a 30-mg/kg dose by i.v. infusion over 10 min. It is concluded that acute hemorrhagic hypovolemia increases the sensitivity of the central nervous system to the depressant effect of DDZP and decreases the body clearance of that drug in rats. Thus, the pharmacodynamics as well as the pharmacokinetics of a benzodiazepine are altered by hypovolemia.\r"

  ".U": "88214711\r", 
  ".W": "Recent reports have shown that the coadministration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) potentiated the hemodynamic actions of i.v. nitroglycerin (NTG) and reversed NTG tolerance in humans. This study has investigated the feasibility of various pharmacokinetic and biochemical mechanisms for the thiol-organic nitrate interaction, using the rat as an animal model. In order to establish that the potentiating interaction between NAC and NTG can be reproduced in the rat, NTG dose-blood pressure response curves were determined before and during concurrent thiol infusion. The hypotensive effect of NTG was enhanced significantly by NAC and glutathione, but not by N-acetylserine, showing clearly that the potentiating effect of NAC was due specifically to its thiol functional group. The systemic clearance of NTG was not affected significantly by NAC coinfusion. In addition, the intracellular metabolism of NTG in thoracic aorta segments from rats infused previously with NAC or N-acetylserine was similar, both with respect to total production of metabolites and their distribution. Thus, the enhancement of NTG action could not be attributed apparently to an effect of NAC on NTG systemic pharmacokinetics or vascular metabolism of NTG. Because glutathione, which does not enter cells readily, also potentiated the effects of NTG, the possibility of an extracellular pathway for the thiol-organic nitrate interaction was examined. In vitro degradation of NTG in plasma and blood was accelerated in the presence of NAC (or glutathione). NAC also promoted the formation of S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine from NTG in rat and human plasma and human blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We examined the actions of Ro5-4684 (parachlorodiazepam) and midazolam on guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle contraction. Binding studies using [3H]Ro5-4684 indicate the presence of a \"peripheral\" type binding site with a Kd of approximately 4 nM and maximum binding of 1 pmol/mg of protein. Midazolam did not displace radioligand. In tension studies no activity was seen for Ro5-4684 or midazolam at concentrations below 1 microM. Higher concentrations relaxed the airway smooth muscle under basal tone, the effect was augmented significantly by epithelium removal. Similar results were obtained in tissues precontracted with methacholine or KCl. Midazolam (1 or 100 microM) significantly (P less than .05) attenuated the response to Ca++ in K+-depolarized tracheal strips, the effect was greater at low Ca++ concentrations. The compounds appear to function as Ca++ antagonists in airway smooth muscle but ar not typical as shown by their ability to reduce basal tone in airway smooth muscle.\r"

  ".U": "88214735\r", 
  ".W": "In the 1,4-benzodiazepine (BZD) series the nature of the C(5) substituent is critical for activity. In tetrazepam this substituent is a cyclohexenyl ring, in all other clinically effective 1,4-BZD derivatives it is a phenyl ring. The activities of tetrazepam and diazepam, whose chemical structures differ only by the nature of the C(5) substituent, were compared in rodent models which are predictive of anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and sedative effects. In mice, tetrazepam and diazepam antagonized pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures, increased novel food consumption, decreased rearing behavior in the Staircase test and impaired performance in the Traction test. The effects of both drugs were abolished by Ro 15-1788. In rats, both drugs antagonized PTZ-induced seizures, released punished responding in an approach-avoidance conflict procedure and blocked the PTZ discriminative cue. In mice and rats, and with both BZDs, maximal activity occurred 15 to 30 min after drug administration. In mice and rats, the overall anxiolytic and muscle relaxant potencies of tetrazepam were one-fourth and one-sixth those of diazepam, respectively. The anticonvulsant potency of tetrazepam varied from one-half (rats) to one-twentieth (mice) that of diazepam. In rats and mice, the sedative potency of tetrazepam (Rotorod test; locomotor activity) was approximately one-sixteenth that of diazepam. Finally, tetrazepam induced a loss of righting reflex in mice, with an ED50 value which was approximately 70-times greater than that of diazepam. It is concluded that replacing the 5-phenyl ring by a 5-cyclohexenyl ring leads to a relative dissociation of the pharmacological actions of the 1,4-BZDs.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ethylene glycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) was studied in rabbit sinoatrial node cells treated with ouabain. When isolated sinoatrial node preparations were bathed in the presence of 10(-5) M ouabain in order to depress electrogenic Na-K pump activity, action potentials ceased rapidly. Thereafter, spontaneous miniature fluctuations of less than 2 mV were observed at the resting potential level, while the membrane potential reached a value of about -31 mV. After exposure to the Ca-free 2 mM EGTA solutions, the miniature fluctuations decreased in frequency as well as in amplitude. However, successive exposure to the Ca-free EGTA solutions produced a short series of slow regenerative potentials. Peak amplitude of the slow regenerative potential increased from reduced miniature fluctuations to a maximum value of 46 +/- 3 mV (mean +/- S.E.; n = 10). Resting potential before initiation of the slow regenerative potential reached a value of about -34 mV. Also, Ca-free perfusion produced a small regenerative potential reaching 19 +/- 2 mV (n = 3). In Ca-free EGTA solution, reduction of external Na produced a decrease in amplitude of the slow regenerative potential when choline chloride or LiCl replaced NaCl. Replacement of 25% of the external Na with choline suppressed the slow regenerative potential. Replacement of 60% of the external Na with Li did not affect the slow regenerative potential. Further reduction of the external Na to 0% of the control condition produced a small regenerative potential. Replacement of Na with Li did not abolish the regenerative potential. In the presence of 4 x 10(-6) M verapamil Ca-free EGTA perfusion did not induce a slow regenerative potential. In the presence of 0.7 x 10(-6) M nifedipine Ca-free EGTA perfusion induced a small regenerative potential reaching 27 +/- 5 (n = 3). For low external pH (6.3) obtained with 5% CO2, the slow regenerative potential induced by Ca-free, EGTA perfusion was suppressed, and the regenerative potential amplitude decreased by about 16 mV. Application of 2.5 mM SrCl2 caused a decrease in slow regenerative potential, and the potential decreased by about 21 mV. The slow regenerative potential is not altered noticeably by 10(-5) M tetrodotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Ascaris-induced increases in total lung resistance (RL) and falls in dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) were unaffected by pretreatment with an antihistamine (pyrilamine) given alone but were significantly attenuated (P less than .05) by the cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitor, indomethacin. The combination of pyrilamine and indomethacin also produced a significant (P less than .01) inhibition of Ascaris-induced bronchoconstriction, greater than that produced by indomethacin given alone but the difference between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant. The combination of an antihistamine, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin and the leukotriene synthesis inhibitor, U-60,257, almost completely abolished Ascaris-induced bronchoconstriction (91% inhibition of Cdyn changes; 93% inhibition of RL changes). The inhibition was significantly greater than that produced by cyclooxygenase inhibition alone. The leukotriene synthesis inhibitor piriprost (U-60,257) given alone or in combination with pyrilamine produced no inhibition of Ascaris-induced changes in RL or Cdyn. The leukotriene antagonist FPL55712 or the thromboxane synthase inhibitor U-63,557A also showed little or no activity in this model, whereas the thromboxane receptor antagonist AH23848 produced a marked inhibition of Ascaris-induced bronchoconstriction. We conclude that Ascaris-induced bronchoconstriction is mediated primarily by cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism. The role of histamine and lipoxygenase products can only be revealed during an effective cyclooxygenase blockade.\r"

Adduct formation was studied as functions of [3H]DMBA dose, of the time after single [3H]DMBA applications, and of the route by which the DMBA was administered--either topically or in the culture media. Total DMBA-DNA adduct formation [total binding index (TBI)] was determined by DNA-bound 3H activity, and qualitative binding characteristics were further studied by high-pressure liquid chromatography. [3H]DMBA was applied either in the culture media at concentrations of 0.005-0.5 micrograms/ml or topically in mineral oil or ethanol in doses of 0.005-0.5 micrograms to each tissue fragment. Histopathologic changes in DMBA-treated HCP fragments included substantial aberrations in maturation of cornified and keratin layers and focal squamatization and dysplasia of the basal epithelium--considerable tissue necrosis was encountered in the high-DMBA-dose groups. Dose-response data were qualitatively similar among treatment types, with the greatest TBIs in topical ethanol groups and the lowest TBIs in culture medium groups. Kinetics of adduct formation and removal showed a rapid increase in TBIs to peak values at 24-72 hours followed by a biphasic decrease in TBIs, which leveled off at 7%-20% of peak values at 120-240 hours. Chromatographic analyses of selected samples at various times from all treatment groups showed three major peaks that are likely to be the same 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3,4-dihydroxy-1, 2-oxide-deoxyribonucleoside adducts observed in other rodent in vivo and cell culture systems. These results are consistent with those of other laboratories studying DMBA-DNA interactions and suggest that in vitro studies of DMBA-treated HCP explants are useful in studying the molecular nature of DMBA-DNA interactions in oral mucosal carcinogenesis.\r"

Highly purified lymphocytes (greater than 99%) were obtained by counter-flow centrifugal elutriation from peripheral blood of healthy donors. After incubation for 4 days with IL-2 (1 U/ml), purified lymphocytes showed maximal LAK activity against NK cell-resistant target (Daudi) cells, as assessed by 4-hour 51Cr release assay. Addition of exogenous IFN-alpha A or IFN-beta to cultures of lymphocytes plus IL-2 resulted in significant inhibition of LAK activity, but addition of IFN-gamma had no effect on LAK induction by IL-2. IFN-alpha A caused greatest inhibition of LAK activity when added at the start of culture of lymphocytes with IL-2, and was less inhibitory when added 1 day later. Similar inhibition by IFN-alpha A or IFN-beta was observed with nine lines of human tumorigenic cells as targets of LAK activity. IFN-alpha A and IFN-beta also inhibited the proliferative responses of lymphocytes to IL-2 stimulation, and the expression of IL-2 receptors on their surface, whereas IFN-gamma did not. These results suggest that IFN-alpha A and IFN-beta may be important in in situ regulation of LAK cell induction against neoplasms.\r"

Plasma fibronectin deficiency exists in such septic patients. We determined if maintenance of fibronectin levels by administration of fibronectin-rich human plasma cryoprecipitate would lower the resuscitative fluid volume needed for support of arterial pressure in septic postoperative sheep which were experimentally depleted of plasma fibronectin. Following a 2-hr postoperative baseline period, denatured collagen (gelatin, 8.7 mg/kg), which has a high affinity for fibronectin, was infused into both control and experimental sheep in order to acutely deplete plasma fibronectin. Sheep were then challenged both intraperitoneally and intravenously with live Pseudomonas (5 x 10(10) bacteria IP; 5 x 10(9) bacteria IV). Experimentals were given fresh plasma cryoprecipitate intravenously at a dose of 4 units bolus, followed by 3 units/hr for 5 hr. Controls received plasma cryoprecipitate selectively depleted of fibronectin by affinity chromatography. Bacterial challenge rapidly resulted in severe systemic hypotension. Ringer's lactate was infused intravenously into both groups at a rate sufficient to maintain a systemic arterial pressure of approximately 50 mm Hg with a maximum pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 15-18 mm Hg. Its rate of infusion was periodically adjusted to maintain this hemodynamic status. Comparison was made of the volume of Ringer's lactate required to maintain an arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg in both groups. Net fluid requirement was significantly (p less than 0.05) less in postoperative septic sheep (47.4 +/- 6.2 mg/kg/hr) treated with fibronectin-rich cryoprecipitate compared to the fluid requirement (71.7 +/- 4.7 mg/kg/hr) for postoperative septic sheep receiving fibronectin-deficient cryoprecipitate. Thus elevation of plasma fibronectin concentration lowers the fluid requirements needed for hemodynamic support in postoperative Gram-negative sepsis.\r"

The control and four experimental groups each contained six rats. In comparison to the control group receiving normal saline (NS) solution, in which no rats survived, all rats given naloxone (Nx) (23 mg/kg), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (10,000 U/kg), or allopurinol (APL) (35 mg/kg), 15 minutes before interruption of cerebral blood flow, survived the 20-minute period of global ischemia (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively). No rat receiving deferoxamine (DEF) (20 mg/kg) survived the same ischemic period. In the second part of the experiment, the arachidonic acid (AA) content of brain samples was determined by gas chromatography and was used as an indicator of cerebral ischemia. Two control and four experimental groups consisted of six rats each. An ischemia control group received NS, whereas experimental groups were given Nx, SOD, APL, or DEF with the same previous dosage schedule. The animals were decapitated 15 minutes after drug infusion and cerebral ischemia was simulated by incubation of the heads in a 37 degrees C water bath for 60 minutes. AA content of ischemic brain treated with NS was markedly elevated (60.0 +/- 24.1 micrograms/gm of brain tissue), whereas in comparison the AA content of brain treated with Nx (5.1 +/- 3.0 micrograms/gm of brain tissue, p less than 0.05), SOD (3.5 +/- 2.7 micrograms/gm of brain tissue, p less than 0.05), or APL (2.9 +/- 1.5 micrograms/gm of brain tissue, p less than 0.05) all demonstrated much lower levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study evaluates the efficacy of bicomponent resorbable prostheses as a method of augmenting resistance to dilatation during the resorption period of the more rapidly resorbed component. Bicomponent prostheses (n = 37) were woven from compound yarns containing 74% polyglactin 910 (PG910) and 26% polydioxanone (PDS) and were interposed into adult white New Zealand rabbit infrarenal aortas. Resultant prosthesis-tissue complexes were harvested after 2 weeks to 12 months. Specimens were photographed and sectioned for light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Randomly selected fresh explants at 1 and 3 months and control aortic segments from the same rabbits were simultaneously perfused with culture media (37 degrees C, 100/80 mm Hg, 60 ml/min) and perfusates assayed by means of tritiated radioimmunoassay techniques for the stable prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha before and after the addition of sodium arachidonate (10 micrograms/ml) to the media. Results showed 100% patency, no aneurysms, and stenosis in 1 of 37 prostheses (3%). PG910 was totally resorbed by 2 months and PDS by 6 months. By 1 month inner capsule thickness was 303 +/- 30 microns. In contrast to previous reports this was significantly thicker than that within 100% PDS (230 +/- 40 microns) and significantly less thick than in 100% PG910 (530 +/- 62 microns). Inner capsules in all three groups stabilized at similar thicknesses (417 to 502 microns).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this experimental model of high-output heart failure, the animals display elevated atrial pressure and systemic vasodilation, but avidly retain sodium. Experiments were performed on Munich-Wistar rats, 8 to 14 days after placement of an infrarenal surgical anastomosis (side-to-side, 0.9 +/- 0.2 mm) and on sham operated controls. Infusion of synthetic ANF (3-28) intravenously (5 micrograms/kg prime; 0.17 microgram/kg.min) resulted in increases in urine flow (V) and fractional sodium excretion (FENa) and decreases in blood pressure (BP) that were significantly attenuated in rats with A-V fistula compared to controls. To control for the lower baseline BP that was present in rats with A-V fistula, a second series of studies was performed in which renal perfusion pressure was reduced in normal rats to 110 mm Hg with a servocontrolled pneumatic cuff. ANF infusion to this group led to significant increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), V and FENa that were greater than those seen in rats with A-V fistula (FENa = 2.7 +/- 0.3% vs. 0.48 +/- 0.12%, P less than 0.05). Thus, the moderately reduced BP in rats with A-V fistula did not account for the blunted response to ANF. To investigate whether the renal sensitivity to ANF is altered in this model, an additional series of experiments were performed in which ANF was infused over a range of doses (0.08 to 2.5 micrograms/kg.min) to both groups of rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Discriminant analysis showed that the combination of these variables that best distinguished patients from controls was provided by apo AI and apo B and a knowledge of parental history of early cardiac death, the most discriminating single factor being apo B. No other variable contributed more than these. Apo (a), however, could be substituted for parental history, which had a major influence on the serum concentration of apo (a). Apo (a) concentration accounted for much of the familial predisposition to cardiac ischaemia. These findings may prove valuable in the clinical assessment of genetic susceptibility to myocardial infarction. They also support the hypothesis that serum apo (a) concentration is a genetic trait that predisposes to arterial thrombosis. Apo B emerged as the main lipoprotein determinant of coronary disease risk.\r"

In normal pregnancy the mean fetal haemoglobin increases linearly from 11 g/dl at 17 weeks' gestation to 15 g/dl at 40 weeks' gestation and one standard deviation is approximately 1 g/dl. The haemoglobin was also measured in fetal blood from 154 red cell isoimmunised pregnancies from 17 to 36 weeks' gestation. In 48 fetuses with ultrasound features of hydrops the haemoglobin was 7-10 g/dl below the normal mean for gestation. It is proposed that in pregnancies complicated by red cell isoimmunisation the severity of the disease should be assessed and treated on the basis of the deviation of the fetal haemoglobin from the normal mean for gestation into mild (haemoglobin deficit less than 2 g/dl), moderate (deficit 2-7 g/dl), and severe (deficit greater than 7 g/dl).\r"

Taken separately, the individual trials have all been too small to provide a reliable estimate of the effects of treatment on mortality, but collectively they provide strong evidence of benefit. In total there have been 136 nitrate and 193 control deaths, and an appropriate overview of the separate trial results indicated a \"typical\" reduction of 35% (SD 10) in the odds of death (2p less than 0.001, with 95% confidence limits of about one-sixth to one-half). Both nitroglycerin and nitroprusside reduced mortality, the reduction being non-significantly greater with nitroglycerin than with nitroprusside. The greatest reduction in mortality occurred during the first week or so of follow-up, with a non-significant further reduction after this early period. This suggests that the early benefit is not rapidly lost.\r"

Three of the four patients were residents of the Soundview area of the Bronx. All diagnoses were confirmed by indirect fluorescent-antibody tests. Environmental investigation revealed that the tick vector for Rickettsia rickettsii, Dermacentor variabilis, was present in a local park. Of the 66 specimens of D. variabilis collected, 5 (8 percent) were positive for rickettsiae from the spotted fever group. Of an additional 96 specimens of D. variabilis, 5 (5 percent) were found positive for rickettsiae by a more specific monoclonal antibody assay. Eight additional New York City parks in all five boroughs were searched for ticks. D. variabilis was found in only one other park; of the 147 ticks collected there, none were positive for rickettsiae. These findings emphasize the focal nature of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and the need to consider that disease in the differential diagnosis of any obscure acute febrile illness, even in the absence of a history of travel to known endemic areas.\r"

  ".W": "Cytokines, products of stimulated macrophages, are thought to mediate many host responses to bacterial infection, but increased circulating cytokine concentrations have not been detected consistently in infected patients. We measured plasma concentrations of circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (cachectin), interleukin-1 beta, and gamma interferon, together with physiologic and hormonal responses, in 13 healthy men after intravenous administration of Escherichia coli endotoxin (4 ng per kilogram of body weight) and during a control period of saline administration. Eight additional subjects received ibuprofen before receiving endotoxin or saline. Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor were generally less than 35 pg per milliliter throughout the control period, but increased 90 to 180 minutes after endotoxin administration to mean peak concentrations of 240 +/- 70 pg per milliliter, as compared with 35 +/- 5 pg per milliliter after saline administration. Host responses were temporally associated with the increase in circulating tumor necrosis factor at 90 minutes, and the extent of symptoms, changes in white-cell count, and production of ACTH were temporally related to the peak concentration of tumor necrosis factor. Ibuprofen pretreatment did not prevent the rise in circulating tumor necrosis factor (mean peak plasma level, 170 +/- 70 pg per milliliter) but greatly attenuated the symptoms and other responses after endotoxin administration. Concentrations of circulating interleukin-1 beta and gamma interferon did not change after endotoxin administration. We conclude that the response to endotoxin is associated with a brief pulse of circulating tumor necrosis factor and that the resultant responses are effected through the cyclooxygenase pathway.\r"

One hundred eight tubes were connected to gravity flow feeding bags containing isotonic enteral formula; 54 polyurethane and 54 silicone tubes were equally divided as to external diameters of 8 French (Fr), 10 Fr, and 12 Fr. At 4-hour intervals, flow regulators on the feeding bags were adjusted to a rate of 50 ml/hour. Fluid volumes delivered per minute were measured for each tube at 2-hour intervals. One set of tubes at each station was irrigated periodically with cranberry juice, Coca-Cola, or water. On each of the 3 days, analyses revealed significant, p less than .05, effects for tube material, cranberry juice contrasted with Coca-Cola and water as irrigants, and time. Polyurethane was consistently superior to silicone as a tube material, and cranberry juice was consistently inferior to both Coca-Cola and water as an irrigant. Tube diameter had no significant effect on the incidence of tube clogging.\r"

  ".W": "It is no surprise that politics and ideology will determine the future of home health and long-term care. Those same forces will also dictate whether home care services will become more or less dependent upon federal support. At the moment the prospects are not promising. Over the last several years our national reimbursement policies have pointed toward more and more stringent use of Medicare home health care benefits, despite the assumptions (and the data) that prospective payment systems might legitimately increase their use. The implementation of tight cost limits, consolidation to ten regional fiscal intermediaries, and increased claim denials have signaled home care agencies that cost containment is the aim of the present conservative administration. Private insurance companies, however, have begun to examine the prospects for long-term care and home care policies. Presently, most home care benefits are available through employment-based policies, which, of course, are nearly useless to the elderly, the major users of home care services. But what if businesses provided more comprehensive health care policies so that their employees could have better protection in the case of long-term illnesses? What if the giant corporation such as IBM, Xerox, General Electric, General Motors, and so forth, established programs to underwrite the cost of long-term care? What if private insurance companies attempted to spread the risks among thousands of policy holders so that long-term care insurance premiums were affordable to most older Americans? Rather than new sources of funding, it is more reasonable to expect that the financing of home care services will be reshaped by innovative reimbursement strategies. The future will probably bring prospective, resource-sensitive, or capitated schemes. There are no easy remedies. We must secure the participation of all sectors of our country--both public and private--in a cooperative endeavor. And at the same time we are struggling to reshape the home care financing system, we must continue the effort to reshape the delivery system itself, because the two go hand-in-glove. It is only then that we can begin to allay one of the major deficiencies of our present health care system--the enormous gap in providing and paying for home health care.\r"

  ".W": "Full-length cDNAs encoding neonatal and adult isoforms of the Ca2+-ATPase of rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells. The microsomal fraction isolated from transfected COS-1 cells contained immunoreactive Ca2+-ATPase and catalyzed Ca2+ transport at rates at least 15-fold above controls. No differences were observed in either the rates or Ca2+ dependency of Ca2+ transport catalyzed by the two isoforms. Aspartic acid-351, the site of formation of the catalytic acyl phosphate in the enzyme, was mutated to asparagine, glutamic acid, serine, threonine, histidine, or alanine. In every case, Ca2+ transport activity and Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation were eliminated. Ca2+ transport was also eliminated by mutation of lysine-352 to arginine, glutamine, or glutamic acid or by mutation of Asp351-Lys352 to Lys351-Asp352. Mutation of lysine-515, the site of fluorescein isothiocyanate modification in the enzyme, resulted in diminished Ca2+ transport activity as follows: arginine, 60%; glutamine, 25%; glutamic acid, 5%. These results demonstrate the absolute requirement of acylphosphate formation for the Ca2+ transport function and define a residue important for ATP binding. They also demonstrate the feasibility of a thorough analysis of active sites in the Ca2+-ATPase by expression and site-specific mutagenesis.\r"

Equilibrium denaturation curves for the mutant protein exhibit biphasic or nonsymmetrical transitions by a variety of spectroscopic and hydrodynamic techniques, whereas the wild-type protein at the same concentration exhibits symmetrical transitions. The mutant protein refolds slower (by a factor of 30) and more readily precipitates upon refolding than the wild-type protein. These folding characteristics of the mutant protein are demonstrated to be a result of stabilization of an associated folding intermediate. A 38-amino acid fragment (96-133) derived from the mutant protein is helical, likely amphipathic, and more stabilized by increasing peptide concentration than is the corresponding helical peptide from the wild-type protein. The increased stability of the associated intermediate and the increased helicity of the peptide from the mutant protein are explained by preferential intermolecular interactions between helices due to enhanced hydrophobic attraction by their amphipathic surfaces.\r"

To investigate the possible role of AP1 in the control of cellular growth and in transformation of mammalian cells, we monitored its activity by binding to a specific DNA probe in normal or transformed mouse NIH 3T3 cells. A 3- to 4-fold increase in the DNA-binding activity was found after serum stimulation of quiescent NIH 3T3 cells. A 2- to 3-fold activation was found after treatment with PMA or dibutyryl-cAMP, suggesting that different signal-transducing pathways could activate AP1 factor in these cells. PMA stimulation was dependent on new protein synthesis. In contrast to normal cells, a high serum-independent AP1 DNA-binding activity was found in NIH 3T3 cells transformed by simian virus 40. These results suggest that constitutive AP1 synthesis may be a crucial step in cellular transformation.\r"

Voltage jumps elicited transient pump currents when the pump cycle was running forward or backward, or when pumps were limited to Na+ translocation, but not when they were made to carry out K+/K+ exchange. This result indicates that K+ translocation involves no net charge movement across the membrane field and is therefore voltage insensitive. The transient pump currents seen during Na+/K+ transport demonstrate that both forward and reverse pump cycles are rate limited not by the voltage-dependent step but by a voltage-independent step, probably K+ translocation. These findings severely constrain kinetic models of Na+/K+ pump activity.\r"

We found that addition of H2O2 to Me2TU yielded a single stable product, Me2TU dioxide. Me2TU dioxide formation correlated with Me2TU consumption as a function of added H2O2 concentration and was prevented by simultaneous addition of catalase (but not boiled catalase), superoxide dismutase, dimethyl sulfoxide, mannitol, or sodium benzoate. Me2TU dioxide formation, Me2TU consumption, and H2O2 concentration increases occurred in mixtures containing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and normal human neutrophils but not in mixtures containing PMA and neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease or in mixtures containing PMA and normal neutrophils and catalase. Me2TU dioxide formation also occurred in isolated rat lungs perfused with Me2TU and H2O2 but not in lungs perfused with Me2TU and elastase, histamine, or oleic acid. In contrast, Me2TU dioxide formation did not occur after exposure of Me2TU to 60Co-generated hydroxyl radical or hypochlorous acid in the presence of catalase. The results indicate that reaction of Me2TU with H2O2 selectively forms Me2TU dioxide and that measuring Me2TU dioxide formation from Me2TU may be useful for assessing the presence and significance of H2O2 in biological systems.\r"

  ".W": "The precise mechanism by which insulin is degraded in mammalian cells is not presently known. Several lines of evidence suggest that degradation is initiated by a specific nonlysosomal insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). The potential importance of this insulin protease is illustrated by the fact that there is an IDE in Drosophila melanogaster Kc cells that shares both physical and kinetic properties with its mammalian counterpart. We now demonstrate that the IDE is present in other Drosophila cell lines and in the embryo, the larvae, the pupae, and adult tissues of the fruit fly. Further, the level of the IDE is developmentally regulated, being barely detectable in the embryo but elevated approximately 5-fold in the larvae and pupae and approximately 10-fold in the adult fly. The IDE levels in the cell lines are particularly high, at least 10-fold greater than in the adult fly. Analysis of Schneider L3 cells indicates that the addition of the Drosophila hormone ecdysone, which induces differentiation of the cells, causes a small but reproducible increase in the level of the IDE and the insulin-degrading activity. These results demonstrate that the IDE is evolutionarily conserved and that its expression is tightly regulated during differentiation of Drosophila. The particular pattern of developmental regulation suggests that the IDE plays a specific and critical role in the later stages of the life cycle of the fly.\r"

We report here that individual cells from transgenic mice carrying a functionally rearranged mu heavy chain gene (capable of generating both membrane and secreted forms of IgM) can rearrange an endogenous mu heavy chain gene and simultaneously produce both transgenic and endogenous IgM. These \"double-producing\" cells express both endogenous and transgenic IgM in the cytoplasm (detected by immunohistology) and on the cell surface (detected by multiparameter fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis). In addition, they secrete mixed IgM molecules containing both transgenic and endogenous mu heavy chains (detected in serum by radioimmune assay). The transgenic mice studied also have relatively large numbers of cells that produce endogenous immunoglobulin in the absence of detectable transgenic immunoglobulin (\"endogenous-only cells\"). The mechanisms that generate double-producing cells and endogenous-only cells appear to be under genetic control because the frequencies of these B-cell populations are characteristic for a given transgenic line. Thus, our findings indicate that more is involved in triggering allelic exclusion than the simple presence or absence of membrane mu heavy chains (as has been previously postulated).\r"

The signals that direct the covalent substitution reaction in these proteins are unknown. Human DAF was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and murine BW lymphocytes. In both cases, the xenogeneic DAF in transfectants incorporated a glycolipid anchor. A chimeric CD8-DAF cDNA, encompassing the extra-cellular region of the T-lymphocyte surface antigen CD8 and the 3' end of DAF mRNA (encoding the C-terminal region of mature DAF as well as the hydrophobic extension peptide), was expressed in human leukemia lines after transfection with an Epstein-Barr virus-based episomal vector. The chimeric protein in transfectants demonstrated glycolipid anchoring, whereas unaltered CD8 in control experiments did not. The signals directing glycolipid anchoring in eukaryotic cells are thus evolutionarily conserved and contained in the 3' end of the DAF sequence.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormal tubulofilamentous structures have been identified in electron micrographs of thin sections and negatively stained impression grids prepared from brains of animals with scrapie and other spongiform encephalopathies, and we showed that such tubules contain a core of filamentous structures resembling scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF). We treated impression grids from brains of scrapie-infected hamsters with several substances that bind to or cleave proteins and nucleic acids to see if they had any effect on the abnormal tubulofilamentous structures. Treatment with three proteolytic enzymes reduced the caliber of the tubules from about 50 nm to 30 nm; subsequent treatment of the 30-nm tubules with DNase I left many typical SAF as well as transitional forms in which twisted SAF emerged from tubules. DNase treatment of the original thicker tubules had no effect, and no SAF were seen on grids. Treatment of the 30-nm tubules with any of three other nucleases (micrococcal, mung bean, and BAL-31) also produced SAF. However, treatment with RNase A had no effect either on the original 50-nm tubules or on the 30-nm tubules produced by proteolysis. Detergent treatment of any of the preparations produced SAF. Treatment with ethidium bromide resulted in staining of the tubules that was inhibited by magnesium ions. The data suggest that the abnormal tubulofilamentous particles found in spongiform encephalopathies may consist of an outer cylinder of protein, an inner cylinder of DNA, and an innermost core of SAF.\r"

  ".W": "Doxorubicin (former generic name, adriamycin), a highly effective anticancer drug, produces cardiotoxicity, which limits its therapeutic potential. The mechanism of this cardiotoxicity has remained elusive. Our data suggest that this toxicity could involve doxorubicinol, the primary circulating metabolite of doxorubicin. Doxorubicinol was markedly more potent than doxorubicin at compromising both systolic and diastolic cardiac function. Similarly, doxorubicinol was much more potent than doxorubicin at inhibiting the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum [ATP phosphohydrolase (Ca2+-transporting), EC 3.6.1.38], the Na+/K+ pump of sarcolemma [ATP phosphohydrolase (Na+/K+-transporting), EC 3.6.1.37], and the F0F1 proton pump of mitochondria [ATP phosphohydrolase (H+-transporting, EC 3.6.1.34]. Our finding that this highly toxic metabolite was produced by cardiac tissue exposed to doxorubicin suggests that doxorubicinol could accumulate in the heart and contribute significantly to the chronic cumulative cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin therapy. Our observation that doxorubicin was more potent than doxorubicinol in inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro suggests that the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin is dissociable from its anticancer activity.\r"

Activation in serum of human [Glu1]plasminogen ([Glu1]Pg) by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was inhibited by the normal serum levels of Cl- and was enhanced by physiological levels of fibrinogen in the presence or absence of Cl-. These results agree with the recognized ability of Cl- to induce a conformation in [Glu1]Pg less favorable for its activation than the conformation that results without Cl-. The enhancing effect of fibrinogen surpassed the inhibitory effect of Cl- over a wide range of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator concentrations in physiological serum. Lesser inhibition by Cl- was seen in a purified clot-lysis system, suggesting that [Glu1]Pg conformation when attached to soluble fibrin matrix was less affected by the anion. The data regarding the roles of circulating fibrinogen and Cl- in controlling the plasma level of activated [Glu1]Pg have important implications in thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.\r"

NPY inhibited the sustained ICa evoked by steps to 0 mV from a holding potential of -40 mV and the inactivating ICa, which was additionally evoked from a more negative holding potential of -80 mV. The effects of NPY on both phases of the ICa were abolished if cells were first treated with pertussis toxin (PTX). When a combination of GTP and the purified alpha-subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Go was perfused into PTX-treated cells, the inhibitory effects of NPY on the ICa reappeared in a time-dependent fashion. GTP or alpha-subunit perfused separately was relatively ineffective. The effects of NPY reappeared more rapidly at higher concentrations of alpha o. Chronic treatment of these cells with phorbol ester \"down-regulates\" protein kinase C (PKC) and reduces inhibition of the sustained current by NPY. In PTX-treated cells in which PKC had been removed by down-regulation, inhibition of ICa was also reconstituted following the perfusion of GTP/alpha o. Under these circumstances, NPY inhibited the transient phase of the ICa more than the sustained phase. These results indicate that Go, the major PTX substrate in the central nervous system, may normally mediate the inhibitory effects of NPY receptors on dorsal root ganglion Ca2+ channels.\r"

We have investigated whether the substance P receptor interacts with the inward rectification channels through a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) by using dissociated cultured neurons from the nucleus basalis of newborn rats. During intracellular application of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate and 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate, hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogues that irreversibly stimulate G proteins, substance P application almost irreversibly suppressed the inward rectification channels. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin did not significantly influence substance P action. Intracellular application of cAMP and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine or of 9-(tetrahydro-2-furyl)adenine (SQ 22,536), an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, did not alter the substance P-induced response. We conclude that the inhibition of inward rectification channels by substance P is mediated through a G protein. However, the effect is not mediated through adenylate cyclase or the cAMP system. This G protein, which is insensitive to pertussis toxin, could be an unidentified G protein.\r"

In nine cases of neurofibromatosis with a carcinoid tumour studied all carcinoid tumours were in the duodenum, were distinctive histologically and had widespread somatostatin immunoreactivity. The duodenum was the primary site in 18 of 20 further published cases of carcinoid tumour and neurofibromatosis. Phaeochromocytoma was also present in six of these 27 cases with neurofibromatosis and duodenal carcinoid tumour. Six patients have been reported with Von Hippel-Lindau complex, phaeochromocytoma and islet cell tumour. A further 11 patients showed phaeochromocytoma and islet cell tumour. No cases of Von Hippel-Lindau complex had a carcinoid tumour, and no cases of neurofibromatosis had an islet cell tumour. We conclude that the association of neurofibromatosis, duodenal carcinoid tumour and phaeochromocytoma forms a distinctive neuroendocrine syndrome, sharply separated from the association of Von Hippel-Lindau complex with islet cell tumour and phaeochromocytoma. This separation is important in pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management.\r"

A combination of structural and immunological comparisons has identified the Fos-associated protein (p39) as the protein product of the jun proto-oncogene (c-Jun). The p39/Jun protein is one of the major polypeptides identified in AP-1 oligonucleotide affinity chromatography extracts of cellular proteins. These preparations of AP-1 also contain Fos and several FRA's. Some of these proteins bind to the AP-1 site directly whereas others, like Fos, appear to bind indirectly via protein-protein interactions. Cell-surface stimulation results in an increase in c-fos and c-jun products. Thus, the products of two protooncogenes (and several related proteins), induced by extracellular stimuli, form a complex that associates with transcriptional control elements containing AP-1 sites, thereby potentially mediating the long-term responses to signals that regulate growth control and development.\r"

All infants underwent weekly virus culture and monthly serology during hospitalization and at 6 to 12 weeks after their last transfusion. Only one of 126 (0.8%) seronegative infants and one of 16 (6.3%) seropositive infants developed CMV infection. If the assumption is made that the CMV-infected infant received only 1 unit of infectious blood, the risk of transfusion-acquired CMV infection to seronegative infants is 0.16 percent per cellular unit transfused or 0.37 percent per seropositive cellular unit transfused. Despite similarities in the prevalence of CMV antibody in the donor population, the age of blood products used, and the mean number of donor exposures, a significantly lower incidence of CMV infection was found in the seronegative transfused infants than that in two previously published studies (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001). Because no mortality and very little morbidity could be attributed to transfusion-acquired CMV infection in the nurseries, the authors can see no justification for the provision of specialized blood components for the prevention of CMV infection in this patient population.\r"

The pathogenesis of granulocyte (PMN) chemotaxis (CTX) dysfunction after room-temperature storage of PMN is unclear. Previous work in the authors' laboratory and others led to the hypothesis that intracellular transmission of chemotactic signals, referred to as stimulus-response coupling (SRC), might be abnormal in stored PMN. This report presents an investigation of the ability of fresh and stored PMN to generate and respond to leukotriene-B4 (LTB4), the chief intracellular amplifier of SRC for CTX. PMN were sampled from concentrates within 4 hours of collection and after 24 and 48 hours of storage in transfer packs at room temperature (RT). Fresh, stimulated PMN synthesized 202 +/- 51 ng of LTB4 and 110 +/- 11 ng of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) per 10(7) PMN. Synthesis of LTB4, but not HETE was significantly decreased after 24 hours' storage, and LTB4 and HETE synthesis decreased after 48 hours. The incubation of stored PMN with arachidonic acid (AA) maintained levels of LTB4 synthesis in PMN stored for 24 but not 48 hours. Also, the CTX defect of stored PMN to F-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) was not improved by the supplementation of PMN with exogenous sources of LTB4 or AA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The concentrations in which they are used are strictly regulated in the United States: citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine (CPDA) is used in a 1:8 ratio for the collection of whole blood, whereas 4 percent sodium citrate (NaCit) is used in a 1:10 ratio for manual plasmapheresis. Acid-citrate-dextrose formula A (ACD-A) or formula B (ACD-B) and NaCit are commonly used in a 1:12 or 1:15 ratio during automated plasmapheresis. These anticoagulants have different initial and final pH values and citrate concentrations and different effects on the recovery of factor VIII (FVIII) in the plasma. NaCit has a higher initial pH (6.64) than ACD-A (4.98), ACD-B (5.60), or CPDA (5.12). The effects of these different anticoagulants on plasma constituents obtained from six healthy subjects were studied. In standard citrate concentrations, the FVIII level was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in the NaCit used for manual plasmapheresis than in either of the ACD solutions used in automated plasmapheresis (104 U/dl vs. 153 and 160 U/dl). When various ratios of NaCit to blood were used, the pH increased from 7.62 at a 1:10 dilution to 7.65 at a 1:50 dilution. As expected, a progressive decrease in anticoagulant level was associated with an increase in ionized calcium and also in the level of FVIII, with the latter values rising from 104 U per dl at 1:10 to 137 at 1:20 and 148 U per dl at 1:30. Clot formation was detected only at a ratio of 1:35.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hetastarch, the currently marketed preparation of hydroxyethyl starch, affects coagulation by prolonging partial thromboplastin, prothrombin, and bleeding times; by lowering clotting proteins such as fibrinogen via hemodilution; by lowering clotting factor VIII (coagulant, von Willebrand antigen, and von Willebrand activity) to a greater degree than can be explained simply by hemodilution (i.e., presumably factor VIII affected by both hemodilutional plus additional, independent effects); and, finally, by shortening thrombin, reptilase, and urokinase-activated clot lysis times. Pentastarch, a new analog of hetastarch, was found to exert lesser effects on blood coagulation, despite its greater hemodiluting properties. When compared with hetastarch, pentastarch had little effect on factor VIII (except that due to hemodilution), shortened thrombin times to a significantly lesser degree, exerted no effect on the urokinase-activated clot lysis time, and did not prolong the bleeding time. Even when plasma hydroxyethyl starch levels were similar, pentastarch seemed to alter the results of coagulation assays to lesser degree than did hetastarch, which suggests the possibility of greater safety. Therefore, pentastarch may be a desirable drug, not only for leukapheresis, but also for plasma volume expansion in trauma and surgical patients who often have additional hemostatic abnormalities that place them at increased risk of hemorrhage.\r"

The patient's pretransplantation serum contained anti-A in a low concentration; therefore, plasmapheresis was not done prior to transfusion of bone marrow. To prevent graft-versus-host disease, bone marrow was incubated with absorbed rabbit antithymocyte globulin prior to infusion, and the patient was treated with methotrexate in the posttransplantation period. After transplantation, the patient received 6 units of group O, Rh-negative (rr) packed red cells from random donors and 6 units of platelets from the marrow donor. Three months after transplantation, 0.5 percent of his red cells were still of the host's type (group O, Rh-positive), as detected by immunofluorescence technique in blood smears. Four months after transplantation, three different Rh antibodies--anti-D, -E, and -G--were detected. Since the patient received only Rh-negative red cell transfusions, it is concluded that he was immunized to his original red cells.\r"

In contrast, this report presents a case that illustrates postoperative red cell alloantibody production by the recipient of an orthotopic liver transplant. Anti-Jka, -c, and -S, detected in the recipient's serum 9 days after transplantation, resulted in significant hemolysis. These alloantibodies had not been present in the recipient's serum before transplantation or in the sera of the liver or blood donors. In addition, anti-Jka and -c were eluted from posttransfusion red cells. The patient was transfused during surgery with crossmatch-compatible blood, that carried the alloantigens Jka, c, and S. The liver donor's red cells also carried the Jka, c, and S antigens. The recipient's pretransplantation red cell phenotyping was Jk(a-), c-, S-. The recipient had received only one transfusion 10 years prior to this operation, after which time he was noted to have anti-K. Immunosuppression initially consisted of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisolone. This is believed to be the first report of delayed immune hemolysis due to non-ABO antibodies in a liver transplant patient treated with cyclosporine.\r"

Systolic blood pressure, heart rate and the rate-pressure product increased during exercise before and after beta-blockade, but levels were lower after beta-blockade. Plasma ANP levels at rest were unchanged after atenolol, but rose after acebutolol (p less than 0.01). During exercise plasma ANP increased significantly both before and after beta-blockade, but plasma ANP levels were higher after acebutolol at all workloads (p less than 0.05), whereas plasma ANP levels after atenolol were higher at 125 W exclusively (p less than 0.05). The augmented ANP levels during exercise after beta-blockade probably reflect catecholamine-stimulated ANP release, whereas the elevated plasma ANP levels after acebutolol at rest might be a beta-adrenoceptor-mediated ANP release due to the intrinsic sympathomimetic effect of acebutolol.\r"

Direct immunofluorescence (IF) using rabbit and goat antihuman monospecific antibodies demonstrated lambda light chain IF in all 13 biopsies (100%). Kappa light chain IF was detected in ten renal biopsies by the rabbit antihuman antisera and in eight renal biopsies by the goat antihuman antisera. Monoclonal antibodies studies showed lambda IF in all 13 biopsies and kappa IF in eight biopsies. Twelve biopsies showed a predominance of lambda light chain IF staining in the mesangial deposits. Identical IF patterns were observed when double IF technique with rhodamine-conjugated antihuman alpha heavy chain antiserum and fluorescein-conjugated antihuman light chain antisera were employed, and these findings confirmed that the light chains IF arose directly from the IgA deposits. These IgA nephritic patients had a significantly higher serum concentration of lambda light chain-IgA and a distinct alteration of kappa/lambda ratio of IgA compared with healthy controls. Our results support our preliminary observation that mesangial IgA deposits in IgA nephropathy consist mostly of IgA with lambda light chain.\r"

Another 50 women, considered to be at low risk for postoperative febrile morbidity, were not given antibiotic prophylaxis. Outcomes of febrile morbidity (18% vs 12%) and particularly morbidity caused by endometritis (6% vs 8%, respectively) were similar for single-dose and three-dose groups. In the untreated low-risk group there were no cases of endometritis and the febrile morbidity was comparable to that of the prophylactically treated groups (14% vs 15%). Single-dose cefazolin prophylaxis appears to be comparable to multidose prophylaxis in reducing febrile morbidity after cesarean section.\r"

Patients with the variables had higher total hospital costs, a longer hospital length of stay, more procedures per patient, a greater proportion of outliers, and a higher mortality than patients without the variables. This study demonstrates that these four clinical variables could be used to focus cost-containment efforts on gynecologic patients incurring higher costs in the coming era of limited resources.\r"

Meperidine and alfentanil differ in pharmacologic properties related to maternal-fetal transfer and neonatal metabolism. Drug-exposed infants showed neurobehavioral effects over the first 3 days of life including depressed respiration (at birth), depressed environmental response to aversive stimuli (days 0, 1, and 2), more overnight sleep (day 1), and more quiet behavior patterns while awake (day 3). In addition, drug exposure was associated with increased elicited muscle tone early in the neonatal period and earlier maturation of sitting, standing, and walking. No effects on growth or health were noted, but drug-exposed infants had lower hematocrits and an earlier onset of a linear growth rate as reflected in body weight. No qualitative or quantitative differences were noted between the two drug treatments. Because behavioral effects were seen after the drug was eliminated, a direct pharmacologic action of the drug does not fully explain the findings.\r"

The mean age was 79.8 years, 59.5 per cent were women. Mean length of initial hospital stay decreased from 10.8 days in 1983 to 7.8 days in 1986. One hundred-nineteen patients (29 per cent) were rehospitalized at least once within three months of initial discharge. The readmission rates by year were: 1983, 40.0 per cent; 1984, 27.5 per cent; 1985, 21.4 per cent; 1986, 23.2 per cent. During this same interval, the percentage of patients referred for home health care services increased from 3.3 per cent in 1983 to 13.0 per cent in 1984, 5.8 per cent in 1985, and 12.5 per cent in 1986. Thus, decreased length of hospital stay was associated with a parallel decline in early readmission rate and increased utilization of home health care services. Although this study has important methodologic limitations, the data suggest that shorter hospital stays under the DRG system are not necessarily associated with an increased rate of early rehospitalization.\r"

When variceal bleeding complicates systemic mastocytosis, shunt surgery is indicated, with the type of shunt dictated by both hematologic and hemodynamic issues. Satisfactory blockade of histamine release can be achieved preoperatively by disodium cromoglycate and/or histamine antagonists to obviate any systemic effects precipitated by shunting of mast cell-rich splenic blood into the systemic circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor 99-126 (ir ANF), plasma volume, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone were measured during pregnancy in 14 normotensive nonpregnant women, 15 normotensive pregnant women, 35 patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), and in ten patients with preeclampsia (PE). Repeated measurements were carried out 2 months after delivery in a subgroup of the same patients. The plasma levels of ANF were found to be higher in pregnant normotensive women than in nonpregnant normotensive women, but the decrease of plasma ANF 2 months after delivery was not significant on the basis of seven paired data, so that it cannot presently be stated with certainty that pregnancy per se stimulates ANF secretion. Still higher levels of ANF were found in PIH and, especially, in PE. A positive correlation was found in the pooled population of normotensive and hypertensive pregnant women between plasma ANF and mean arterial pressure. A greater decrease of plasma ANF was found after delivery in the hypertensive patients than in the normotensive controls. This excludes an absolute deficiency of ANF secretion in the pathogenesis of hypertension. These findings suggest a compensatory role of ANF in the prevention of blood pressure increase. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentrations were higher in normotensive pregnant women than in normotensive nonpregnant women. Compared to normal pregnancy, plasma volume was decreased in PIH (-17%) and in PE (-25%), whereas PRA was less increased in both groups and plasma aldosterone concentration was less increased only in the PE group. The simultaneous high levels of plasma ANF may explain this inappropriate hypostimulation of renin secretion by hypovolemia in these hypertensive states.\r"

In both strains, atrial ANF concentrations peaked at 15 days of age. Atrial ANF concentrations did not differ between the two strains from 5 to 25 days of age. However, by 51 days of age, atrial ANF concentrations in the S/JR rat were significantly greater than those of the R/JR rat. Combining these data with developmental patterns of plasma renin activity in S/JR rats suggests the possibility that the S/JR rat may become intravascularly volume-expanded between 25 and 51 days of age. This volume expansion may contribute to the etiology of hypertension in this model of essential hypertension.\r"

The long-term (2 weeks) administration of dietary lithium (Li) reduced the activation of PI by NE in left A and right V but caused no changes in MA of HT rats. The Li-treated hypertensive rats were also characterized by a lower systolic blood pressure and a lower ratio of ventricular weight/body weight.

The peritoneal cavity was simulated by a bubble oxygenator into which 10% CO2 was diffused. Bicarbonate was initially added, but subsequently regenerated by the system. An insoluble chemical (barium hydroxide lime) was used to precipitate the bicarbonate and produce OH- ions, which prevent the acidosis anticipated with the loss of bicarbonate. CO2 removal was computed from the gas flow rate and CO2 concentration as measured with an infrared analyzer. The rate of CO2 removal was found to be a directly linear function of dialysate flow rate, gas flow rate, and concentration of bicarbonate. The model removed 60 ml/min of CO2, but it is capable of removing more, since the variables affecting CO2 removal are controllable by the observer. This new method can extract bicarbonate CO2 without causing depletion of bicarbonate or requiring an infusion of alkali. It is potentially useful in management of hypercapnic respiratory failure and as an adjunct to \"apneic oxygenation\" in respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

Initial studies demonstrated that a solution of high osmolality was required to provide sufficient calories. A nutrient solution was formulated by mixing 20% glucose with electrolytes (10 ml) and 8.5% amino acids with electrolytes (20 ml). Instilling 30 ml of nutrient solution induced an IP volume of 60 ml, which was absorbed in 24 hours. Rats were studied in four groups for 7 days. One group received nutrient solution IP (n = 10); a second group received the same amount PO (n = 10); the third group received electrolytes IP (n = 10); and a fourth group was fed rat chow PO (n = 10). Rats fed this nutrient solution (IP and PO) were acclimatized by administering one third of their required nutrient the first 4 days. On the next 3 days they received two thirds of their required nutrient. Both groups fed nutrient solution (IP and PO) lost 23% body weight. Electrolyte and rat chow fed groups lost 26% and gained 8% of body weight, respectively. Due to the high osmolality (1200 mOsm/L) of this nutrient solution, sufficient food could not be delivered via the peritoneal cavity to adequately feed growing rats. Studies were then initiated to formulate another nutrient solution that contained lipids. This solution (678 mOms/L) contained 20% glucose with electrolytes (10 mls), 8.5% amino acids with electrolytes (20 ml), and 10% lipids without electrolytes (30 ml). Glucose and amino acids contained the same electrolyte concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A sample taken 30 minutes after reversion to sinus rhythm (pharmacological or non-pharmacological) showed a significant fall in 19 of the 23 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and all seven patients with atrial flutter. Because atrial natriuretic polypeptide has powerful natriuretic and diuretic properties, an increase may contribute considerably to the polyuria that is often associated with episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "Ambiguous phenotypes and genotypes were observed in 16 children with acute leukemia. Surface marker, cytogenetic, molecular genetic, and DNA flow cytometric analyses as well as standard morphologic and cytochemical studies were used to divide the patients into three groups. The first group comprised five children with acute leukemia whose blast cells were morphologically lymphoid, while immunophenotyping disclosed simultaneous expression of early pre-B cell and myeloid features. Molecular genetic studies showed evidence of heavy-chain immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements in all patients. Cytogenetic data, available in three of these children, revealed t(4;11). In five of the 16 patients, morphologic and surface marker analyses indicated the coexistence of two separate cell populations, one with myeloid and the other with early pre-B cell features. Further evidence of B cell commitment in these patients was provided by demonstration of Ig heavy-chain gene rearrangements in all five patients. Surprisingly, one of the five patients showed oligoclonal Ig heavy-chain as well as monoclonal gene rearrangement for the beta chain of the T cell receptor (beta-TCR). The last group consisted of four cases with otherwise typical acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), early pre-B cell phenotype, and coexpression of myeloid or T cell-associated antigens, and two children with unequivocal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and coexpression of T cell antigens. Gene rearrangement of Ig heavy-chain could be demonstrated in five of six patients, additional Ig light-chain gene rearrangement in two children with ALL, and bigenotypic features (Ig heavy-chain and beta-TCR gene rearrangement) in one patient. In none of the 16 patients did flow cytometry disclose clonal abnormalities of leukemic cell DNA content. Based on these findings, we suggest that malignant transformation in the first and second group of patients took place at a stage ontogenetically close to the pluripotent stem cell, whereas ambiguous phenotypes in the third group resulted from aberrant gene expression or insufficient reagent specificity.\r"

  ".W": "Blast cells from 100 cases of acute leukemia were evaluated for the presence of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAase), an enzyme important in polyamine metabolism. Ten cases (10%) had undetectable levels of MTAase activity. Of the 10, 5 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 3 had acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and 2 expressed mixed lineage markers as determined by immunophenotyping. A relatively high frequency (38%) of MTAase deficiency was seen in ALL of T-cell origin. Nonmalignant hematopoietic cells from three patients with MTAase-deficient leukemias had readily detectable enzyme activity. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in four of the seven MTAase-deficient cases in which karyotypic analysis was performed. No consistent karyotypic defect was apparent, and only one case displayed changes in chromosome 9, the putative location of the MTAase structural gene. The clinical findings among the enzyme-deficient cases were unremarkable except that all patients were male (P less than .01). Only one patient had \"lymphomatous\" features. We conclude that MTAase deficiency occurs in a wide variety of acute leukemias, that the lack of enzyme activity is specific to the malignant cells, and that an increased incidence occurs in ALL of T-cell origin. Furthermore, no specific gross chromosomal abnormality is associated with the enzyme deficiency. The marked male predominance in patients with MTAase-deficient acute leukemias suggests involvement of the X chromosome in the loss of enzyme activity. The absence of MTAase in some leukemias may be therapeutically exploitable.\r"

  ".W": "Although circulating human monocytes do not express transferrin (Tf) receptors, cultured adherent blood cells display high-affinity Tf binding sites. In the present studies, effects of various cytokines and biologically active proteins on human monocyte/macrophage Tf receptors were investigated. After culture, Tf receptor expression by adherent blood cells was time dependent and plateaued by 7 days. The addition of interleukin-1 (IL-1), alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN), granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or human IgG to macrophages cultured for 4 days did not alter Tf receptor expression. Fe-saturated, human Tf caused a significant, dose-dependent decrease in receptor expression. At a dose of 100 U/mL, gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) significantly increased Tf receptor expression by macrophages cultured for 4 (230% +/- 51% of control) or 7 days (150% +/- 22%). Scatchard analyses showed increased binding sites but no change in receptor affinity. Northern and slot blot analysis of cellular mRNA from macrophages cultured for 4 to 7 days and exposed to gamma-IFN showed a two- to fivefold increase in Tf receptor mRNA, but less than or equal to 30% increase in beta-actin mRNA. Ferritin content of gamma-IFN-treated macrophages was 47% to 63% of control cells. Net uptake of 59Fe from Tf by gamma-IFN-treated cells was 10% to 17% of control, but uptake of radiolabeled Tf was comparable. When macrophages were labeled with 59Fe and then exposed to gamma-IFN, cell-associated Fe was reduced by 43%, indicating that gamma-IFN caused macrophage Fe release. gamma-IFN specifically modulates Tf receptor display by inducing Fe release and reducing cellular Fe content. Regulation of Tf receptor expression in macrophages is controlled by cellular Fe content and is thus similar to regulatory mechanisms in dividing cells.\r"

In the present study, HILDA was purified to homogeneity from T-cell clone supernatant using successively sequential concentration, concanavalin A (ConA) affinity chromatography with differential elution (alpha-D glucopyranoside and alpha-D mannopyranoside), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC. The pure material appeared as a 38-kd glycoprotein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Biologic activity could be recovered from SDS-PAGE gel slices corresponding to the 38-kd band. We conclude from the specificity of the DA-2 cell line and biochemical characteristics described that this lymphokine is different from other known factors produced by human T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous observation on immune modulation induced by a given factor VIII (F VIII) concentrate preparation was extended by showing that the immune-modulating capacity is a more general feature of F VIII products and is independent of product purity. Interaction of human monocytes with therapeutic concentrations of various F VIII concentrates (0.2 to 2 IU F VIII/mL, six different F VIII concentrates from four manufacturers) led to a significant reduction in the expression of IgG Fc receptors in the membrane of these cells (F VIII concentrate-induced downmodulation of the receptor). This Fc receptor downmodulation was achieved by a short (1-hour) incubation of human monocytes with F VIII concentrates 16 hours prior to the Fc receptor assay and did not correlate with the respective product's IgG content. Although the IgG concentrations of the different products varied greatly (from 1.0 to 177.3 mg/1,000 IU F VIII), all products behaved comparably with respect to Fc receptor downmodulation (F VIII-treated monocytes: 34% +/- 7% to 44% +/- 4% rosette-forming cells; controls in the absence of F VIII: 83% +/- 5%). Furthermore, we also were able to demonstrate that heat treatment of F VIII, now used by virtually every manufacturer to eliminate contaminating viruses, had no effect on the respective products' Fc receptor-modulating capacity. The immune-modulating component was characterized as being a high-molecular-range compound containing IgG, IgM, F VIII, and blood group substances (most likely a combination of immune complexes and immunoglobulin aggregates). This compound is present in comparable amounts in both high-purity and intermediate-purity products and apparently copurifies with F VIII during the manufacturing process.\r"

The hybrid cell line produced large amounts of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, and a small amount of urokinase. All plasminogen activator present in conditioned medium was complexed with inhibitor because the cells secreted plasminogen activator inhibitor in excess over plasminogen activator and no activator activity was detectable in conditioned media by direct activity assays. t-PA activator activity was, however, demonstrable in conditioned media after treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate, in agreement with t-PA antigen determinations. Increased plasminogen activator inhibitor activity could be induced by incubating the cells in the presence of endotoxin or microtubule inhibitors, whereas increased t-PA activity could be induced by microtubule inhibitors. Interleukin-1 had no effect. The fibrinolytic characteristics of the hybrid cell line were stable for at least 30 passages. The perpetual human hybrid cell line EA.hy 926 therefore may be a useful tool for the study of fibrinolysis in cultured endothelial cells.\r"

We report here the study of the TCR-alpha genetic locus by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), which permits the separation of large DNA fragments. Analysis of DNA prepared from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, human endothelial cells, and a B cell line demonstrates that both V and C sequences are contained within a single 400-kb SfiI restriction fragment.

  ".W": "Thirty patients with hypercalcaemia and known malignant disease were randomly allocated to receive 60 mg 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (APD) intravenously as a single dose or as consecutive daily doses of 30 mg (two days) or 15 mg (four days). The rate of infusion was the same for each regimen (7.5 mg/hour). Calcium concentrations fell in all patients and returned to normal in all but two. Relapse of hypercalcaemia occurred after a mean of 21 days in each group. Urinary calcium excretion fell in all groups and symptoms were greatly improved. After relapse patients were retreated with APD (30 mg as a single infusion) and normocalcaemia maintained by regular infusions at two to three week intervals. APD given as a single 60 mg infusion over eight hours together with rehydration is recommended as the initial management of the hypercalcaemia of malignancy, followed by 30 mg APD roughly every two to three weeks to maintain normal or near normal serum calcium concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "To study the role of parathyroid gland activity in early primary hypertension plasma concentrations of intact parathyroid hormone were measured in 90 untreated young subjects, aged 16-29, with stable midly raised blood pressure and in 40 normotensive control subjects selected from the same population in Zoetermeer, The Netherlands. Intact parathyroid hormone concentration was significantly higher in the hypertensive than the normotensive group (2.34 (SE 0.11) pmol/l v 1.47 (0.13) pmol/l, respectively; difference 0.87 pmol/l; 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.21; p less than 0.0001). Serum total calcium concentration was 2.36 (0.01) mmol/l in the hypertensive group and 2.42 (0.01) mmol/l in the normotensive group (difference 0.06 mmol/l; 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.09; p = 0.02). Urinary calcium excretion over 24 hours did not differ significantly between the two groups (4.17 (0.28) mmol/24 h in the hypertensive group and 3.89 (0.39) mmol/24 h in the normotensive group; difference 0.28 mmol/24 h; 95% confidence interval -0.66 to 1.22). In the hypertensive group both systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased slightly though significantly with intact parathyroid hormone concentrations. No obvious associations between serum calcium concentration and blood pressure were observed. These findings support the view that enhanced activity of the parathyroid gland may play a part in the early stage of primary hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "As malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum has become resistant to chloroquine alternative drug regimens need to be developed. The prophylactic efficacy against malaria and the side effects of chloroquine phosphate 500 mg weekly with proguanil hydrochloride 200 mg daily was compared with the efficacy of chloroquine 500 mg weekly with sulfadoxine 500 mg-pyrimethamine 25 mg weekly in a randomised study of Scandinavian travellers to Kenya and Tanzania during 1984-5. A total of 767 subjects (416 male and 351 female; 384 taking chloroquine phosphate with proguanil hydrochloride and 383 taking chloroquine with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) completed a diary on the breakthrough of malaria and the side effects of treatment while taking the drugs. They were also asked to make thick blood films when symptoms like those of malaria occurred, which were sent to and analysed in Denmark. Four subjects taking chloroquine with proguanil hydrochloride and three taking chloroquine with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine developed falciparum malaria, which was verified microscopically. Side effects were reported by 36 subjects taking chloroquine phosphate with proguanil hydrochloride and 55 taking the other regimen (p = 0.043). The side effects of both regimens were generally mild, but the combination of chloroquine phosphate with proguanil hydrochloride is recommended because it results in fewer side effects. As breakthroughs of malaria occurred at the earliest after seven weeks self treatment should not be recommended for travellers staying only a short time. Thick blood films are useful for diagnosis of suspected cases of malaria, can be prepared by non-specialists in Africa, and can be analysed successfully after long delays.\r"
