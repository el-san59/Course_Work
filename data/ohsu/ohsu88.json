We also reviewed long-term survival, causes of death, and risk factors for death in old patients on dialysis at one center for the period 1966 to 1983. A comparison of the number of patients at risk with the number entering dialysis in the United States in 1979 indicates that 80% of the patients aged 25-45 years, 30% of patients over the age of 65 years, and 6% of those over the age of 75 years entered dialysis during that period. Of 239 patients over the age of 70 years followed at the Regional Kidney Disease Program at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, the seven-year cumulative survival was 17%. In this program withdrawal from dialysis was the commonest cause of death, accounting for 40% of all deaths. Age groups over 75 years, sex, time period, duration of dialysis, eight pre-existing degenerative diseases, living situation, family support, and site and type of dialysis were not risk factors for termination of dialysis, but living in a nursing home was. When compared to the young, total deaths and deaths from discontinuation were much higher, and this decision was made earlier. Half of the patients who died because dialysis was discontinued were competent and decided for themselves; the other half were incompetent and families and physicians made the decision.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The treatment time was fixed at 4 hours. Our study showed that the dialyzer surface area and the ultrafiltration rate were the major factors in dialytic inorganic phosphorus (Pi) removal. The dialysate buffer does not modify dialytic Pi removal but may influence the rebound phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "The transport mechanisms governing solvent and solute removal during CAVH were elucidated on the basis of in vitro and in vivo observations. Using a typical hemofilter (Diafilter D-20, AMICON), filtration rate rose with inlet blood flow rate until an asymptote was reached at blood flows of approximately 150 ml/min. The onset of the asymptote coincided with transition from a regime controlled by oncotic pressure (filtration pressure equilibrium), to one governed by simple Darcy's law filtration behaviour. Subsequent measurements showed that under clinical conditions, CAVH is generally in the pre-asymptotic regime and operates at filtration pressure equilibrium. These observations offer the theoretical bases for a new design for CAVH hemofilters. As a possible corollary, middle-molecule sieving coefficients were found to be stable with time during CAVH in vivo, whereas in chronic mechanical hemofiltration they declined significantly during clinical treatment. The sieving coefficients, however, were lower in mechanical hemofiltration from the beginning of the session. These observations suggest that the measured sieving coefficient for a membrane is not necessarily a constant directly and solely related to the membrane standard reflection coefficient for a given solute. Concentration polarization and the ultrafiltration rate per unit of surface area may in fact have a major effect on the final concentration of solutes in the ultrafiltrate.\r"

After plasma exchange levels of clotting factors and ATIII were markedly lowered but except for fibrinogen and factor XIII, they were not reduced by repeated exchange procedures. Thyroid hormones and TBG were reconstituted after 24 h. Pre-exchange levels, except for TT4 and TBG, were not lowered by repeated exchange procedures. Risk of bleeding or thrombosis is small and there is no appreciable risk of loss of thyroid hormones during repeated plasma exchanges.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that endogenous opioids modulate fetal lung development, separate groups of pregnant rabbits received daily injections of saline, morphine (1 mg/kg body wt), or the opioid antagonist naloxone (0.4 and 5.0 mg) for 10 days during their last trimester of pregnancy. The corresponding groups of fetuses were then delivered prematurely on day 28 of gestation (term approximately 31 days) and evaluated with respect to differences in body weight, lung weight, and the ratios of wet to dry lung weight and lung dry weight to body weight, the static inflation and deflation air and saline pressure-volume (P-V) characteristics of the lungs, and lung morphology. Mean values for body weight, lung weight, and the ratios of lung wet to dry weight and lung dry weight to body weight were not significantly different among the saline control (C), morphine (M)-, and naloxone (NLX)-treated fetuses. On the other hand, the fetal air P-V curves varied significantly (P less than 0.001), wherein the M-treated group depicted increased lung distensibility and alveolar stability on lung deflation, whereas the opposite was obtained in the NLX-treated fetuses. Moreover, morphometric analyses demonstrated that the mean alveolar air space-to-tissue ratio in lungs from M-treated fetuses were significantly greater than that observed either in C or in NLX-treated fetuses (P less than 0.05); however, the air space-to-tissue ratio did not significantly vary between the C and NLX-treated animals. These observations provide new evidence that endogenous opioids enhance fetal lung maturation.\r"

During the experiments we continuously infused the alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine hydrochloride (1.0 microgram X kg-1 X min-1 iv) or the alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine mesylate (1.0 mg X kg-1 X min-1 iv), and we measured pulmonary vascular pressures, cardiac output, lung lymph flow, and the lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio. During air embolism, alpha-receptor stimulation increased pulmonary vascular resistance and decreased lung lymph flow by 25%; alpha-receptor blockade had the opposite effects. During recovery, neither agent significantly affected pulmonary hemodynamics or lymph flow. Our results indicate that alpha-adrenergic receptors are active during air embolism and modulate pulmonary filtration by causing arteriolar constriction, which reduces the surface area or the perfusion pressure in the pulmonary microvascular bed. They may also affect venous smooth muscle tone. We found no evidence that alpha-adrenergic receptors modulate lung microvascular liquid or protein leakiness directly.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac performance was assessed in six subjects breath-hold diving to 20 m in a hyperbaric chamber, while nonsubmersed or submersed in a thermoneutral environment. Cardiac index and systolic time intervals were obtained with impedance cardiography and intrathoracic pressure with an esophageal balloon. Breath holding at large lung volume (80% vital capacity) decreased cardiac index, probably by increasing intrathoracic pressure and thereby impeding venous return. During diving, cardiac index increased (compared with breath holding at the surface) by 35.1% in the nonsubmersed and by 29.5% in the submersed condition. This increase was attributed to a fall in intrathoracic pressure. Combination of the opposite effects of breath holding and diving to 20 m left cardiac performance unchanged during the dives (relative to the surface control). A larger intrathoracic blood redistribution probably explains a smaller reduction in intrathoracic pressure observed during submersed compared with nonsubmersed diving. Submersed breath-hold diving may entail a smaller risk of thoracic squeeze (lesser intrathoracic pressure drop) but a greater risk of overloading the central circulation (larger intrathoracic blood pooling) than simulated nonsubmersed diving.\r"

Changes of contraction properties were studied in the adductor pollicis muscle. The contralateral muscle remained unrestrained and served as control. After immobilization, the maximal voluntary contraction was reduced by 55% (P less than 0.05), and the electrically evoked maximal tetanic contraction (Po) was reduced by 33% (P less than 0.05). The decrease of Po was associated with increased maximal rate of tension development (10%) and decreased maximal rate of tension relaxation (22%). The twitch times to peak and to half relaxation were increased by 16 and 14%, respectively, but the twitch tension (Pt) was not significantly changed and the Pt/Po ratio was increased by 43% after immobilization. The muscle surface action potential presented an increase of its duration (19%) and a decrease of the amplitude and the total area (15 and 26%, respectively). The comparison of the electrical and mechanical alterations recorded during voluntary contractions, and in contractions evoked by electrical stimulation of the motor nerve, suggests that immobilization not only modifies the peripheral processes associated with contraction but also changes central and/or neural command of the contraction. At peripheral sites, it is proposed that the intracellular processes of contraction play the major role in the contractile impairment recorded during immobilization.\r"

The influences of NaOH addition, equilibration temperature, and hemoglobin concentration on these respiratory changes of Osm were measured by freezing-point determination in true plasma. Addition of NaOH increases Osm by 2 mosmol X kg H2O-1 X mmol base-1 X l at constant PCO2 due to the osmotic effects of Na+ and produced bicarbonate. Respiratory compensation of the pH change further increases Osm. This contrasts to the respiratory compensation of the osmolar disturbance caused by fixed acid. Raising the equilibration temperature reduces Osm by 0.5 mosmol X kg H2O-1 X degrees C-1 at constant pH mainly caused by a lower absorption coefficient for CO2 and changed pK value for H2CO3. The slope of the linear regression lines between Osm and pH during CO2 equilibration increases with hemoglobin; the value of the quotient delta Osm/delta pH depends directly on the nonbicarbonate buffer value. The use of this quotient for the estimation of the mean nonbicarbonate buffer value of the whole body is suggested. The osmotic effects of therapeutic base infusion should be regarded with caution.\r"

Thus, female rats were subjected to the independent and simultaneous exposure of functional overload (induced via synergist removal) and hindlimb unweighting (suspension) for 6 wk. Groups (n = 7/group) consisted of normal-control (NC); overload (OV); normal-suspension (N-SUS); and overload-suspension (OV-SUS). Body weight of both suspension groups was significantly less than both the NC and OV groups (P less than 0.001). Compared with the NC group, normalized plantaris weight (mg/g body wt) of both the OV and OV-SUS groups was greater, whereas that of the N-SUS was lower (P less than 0.001). However, normalized plantaris weight was greater in OV compared with OV-SUS by 35% (P less than 0.001). Myofibril protein content (mg/g) and Ca2+-regulated myofibril adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) specific activity were similar for all groups except that ATPase was lower in the OV group compared with the other groups (P less than 0.05). Native myosin isoform analysis revealed a significant increase in the expression of slow and intermediate myosin and the repression of fast myosin 1 (Fm1) in OV compared with NC. This shift in expression was not as pronounced in the OV-SUS group. Interestingly, only traces of slow myosin were observed in the N-SUS group compared with the other groups. These results suggest that weight bearing is an essential component of the overload model for inducing significant increases in both muscle mass and slow myosin isoform expression. Second, lack of weight bearing, while not markedly affecting fast myosins, appears to repress the expression of slow myosin.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of hypoxia-induced unstable and periodic breathing on the incidence of obstructed breaths in nine subjects who varied widely in their increase in total pulmonary resistance (RL) during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. During normoxic NREM sleep, all subjects showed hypoventilation, augmented diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi), and increased RL. This response varied: two subjects doubled their mean RL (range 6-9 cmH2O X l-1 X s); four moderate snorers increased RL four- to eightfold (RL = 16-48 cmH2O X l-1 X s); three heavy snorers showed high RL (31-89 cmH2O X l-1 X s) plus cyclical obstructive hypopnea as their predominant breathing pattern. In seven of nine subjects, hypoxia and coincident hypocapnia initially caused an irregular cyclical breathing pattern with obstructed breaths (RL greater than 50 cmH2O X l-1 X s). The incidence of obstructed breaths induced by unstable breathing was closely correlated with the level of RL experienced in the control condition of normoxic sleep (r = 0.91). The obstructed breaths had relatively high O2 saturation (90-96%) and markedly reduced EMGdi activity and peak flow rate (less than 0.2 l/s) compared with breaths immediately after the obstructed breaths, which showed lower O2 saturation (81-93%) and markedly augmented EMGdi and flow rates. After 3-6 cycles of obstructive hypopnea, periodic breathing occurred in most subjects. During periodic breathing in six of seven subjects, the incidence of obstructed or high-resistance breaths was decreased or eliminated since each central apneic period was followed by breath clusters characterized by very high EMGdi, very low RL, and high flow rates. The remaining subject showed a high incidence of obstructed breaths during all phases of normoxic and hypoxic sleep. These data show that hypoxia-induced instability in breathing pattern can cause obstructed breaths during sleep coincident with reduced motor output to inspiratory muscles. However, this obstruction is only manifested in subjects susceptible to upper airway atonicity and narrowing (such as snorers) and can be prevented in most cases if respiratory drive is permitted to reach sufficiently high levels (as during central apnea).\r"

Pulsatile force was applied to the sternum in increments to determine the effects of increasing compression on chest geometry and intrathoracic vascular pressures. In 2-wk- and 1-mo-old piglets, permanent changes in chest shape developed due to incomplete recoil of the chest along the anteroposterior axis, and large intrathoracic vascular pressures were generated. In 3-mo-old animals, permanent chest deformity did not develop, and large intrathoracic vascular pressures were not produced. We propose a theoretical model of the chest as an elliptic cylinder. Pulsatile displacement along the minor axis of an ellipse produces a greater decrease in cross-sectional area than displacement of a circular cross section. As thoracic cross section became less circular due to deformity, greater changes in thoracic volume, and hence pressure, were produced. With extreme deformity at high force, pulsatile displacement became limited, diminishing pressure generation. We conclude that changes in chest geometry are important in producing intrathoracic intravascular pressure during conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation in piglets.\r"

To determine whether this decreased lung volume affected the ventilatory adaptation to exercise, minute ventilation (VE), its components, frequency (f) and tidal volume (VT), and breathing pattern were observed during incremental cycle-ergometer exercise. Eighteen Caucasian (age 8-30 yr) and 14 Black (age 8-25 yr) subjects were studied. Vital capacity (VC) was lower (P less than 0.001) in the Black subjects [90.6 +/- 8.6 (SD) vs. 112.9 +/- 9.9% predicted], whereas functional residual capacity/total lung capacity was higher (P less than 0.05). VE, mixed expired O2 and CO2, VT, f, and inspiratory (TI), expiratory (TE), and total respiratory cycle (TT) duration were measured during the last 30 s of each 2-min load. Statistical comparisons with increasing power output were made at rest and from 0.6 to 2.4 W/kg in 0.3-W/kg increments. VE was higher in Blacks at all work loads and reached significance (P less than 0.05) at 0.6 and 1.5 W/kg. VE/VO2 was also higher throughout exercise, reaching significance (P less than 0.01) at 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 W/kg. The Black subjects attained any given level of VE with a higher f (P less than 0.001) and lower VT. TI and TE were shortened proportionately so that TI/TT was not different. Differences in lung volume and the ventilatory response to exercise in these Black and Caucasian subjects suggest differences in the respiratory pressure-volume relationships or that the Black subjects may breathe higher on their pressure-volume curve.\r"

We measured esophageal temperature (Tes), mean skin temperature (Tsk, 8 sites), and local sweating (ms) from dew-point sensors attached to the skin at the chest, arm, and thigh. Skin blood flow (SkBF) of the forearm was measured once each minute by venous occlusion plethysmography. There were no gender differences in the sensitivity (slope) or the threshold of either ms/Tes or SkBF/Tes at any altitude. No change in the Tes for sweating onset occurred with altitude. The mean slopes of the ms/Tes relationships for the three regional sites decreased with increasing altitude, although these differences were not significant between the two lower PBS. The slope of SkBF/Tes was reduced in five of the eight subjects at 428 Torr. Enhanced body cooling as a response to the higher evaporative capacity of the environment is suggested as a component of these peripheral changes occurring in hypobaric hypoxia.\r"

Alveolar permeability to solute, lung compliance, total lung capacity, and alveolar protein levels were unchanged from control, but the amount of lavagable alveolar phospholipid was 90% higher in the O2-exposed rabbits. The lipid biosynthetic ability of isolated alveolar type II pneumocytes, measured by radiolabeled precursor [3H]choline incorporation, indicated that type II cells isolated from hyperoxic animals synthesized phosphatidylcholine at a rate 110% higher than those from control animals. Laser flow cytometric analyses of isolated type II cells showed a significant increase in type II cell diameter, based on time-of-flight measurements, and an average 60% increase in lipid content per cell, based on phosphine-3R fluorescence intensity. These findings indicate that exposure to 60% O2 for 21 days results in a decrease in arterial PO2 and induces several important biochemical and morphological changes in alveolar type II pneumocytes.\r"

During the contraction period muscle lactate concentrations increased from a control level of 3.6 +/- 0.6 to a final value of 24.1 +/- 1.6 mumol/g muscle. To determine whether the lactate that had accumulated in muscle during contraction could be used to resynthesize glycogen, glycogen levels were determined after 1-3 h of recovery from the contraction period during which time the perfusion medium (flow-through system) contained low (1.3 mmol/l) or high (10.5 or 18 mmol/l) lactate concentrations but no glucose. With the low perfusate lactate concentration, muscle lactate levels declined to 7.2 +/- 0.8 mumol/g muscle by 3 h after the contraction period and muscle glycogen levels did not increase (1.28 +/- 0.07 at 3 h vs. 1.35 +/- 0.09 mg glucosyl U/g at end of exercise). Lactate disappearance from muscle was accounted for entirely by output into the venous effluent. With the high perfusate lactate concentrations, muscle lactate levels remained high (13.7 +/- 1.7 and 19.3 +/- 2.0 mumol/g) and glycogen levels increased by 1.11 and 0.86 mg glucosyl U/g, respectively, after 1 h of recovery from exercise. No more glycogen was synthesized when the recovery period was extended. Therefore, it appears that limited resynthesis of glycogen from lactate can occur after the contraction period but only when arterial lactate concentrations are high; otherwise the lactate that builds up in muscle during contraction will diffuse into the bloodstream.\r"

The contractile responses to electrical field stimulation at 30 s and 1 min after the addition of autologous platelets were increased by 11.1 +/- 3.2 (SD) and 20.7 +/- 5.4%, respectively, and were accompanied by the release of thromboxane A2. These effects were inhibited either by pretreatment of platelets with indomethacin or by addition of the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist SQ 29548. Likewise, the thromboxane A2 mimetic U 46619, in subthreshold doses (i.e., insufficient to increase base-line tension), increased electrical field stimulation-induced contraction by 18.7 +/- 4.8%. The increase was greater in the presence of a concentration of physostigmine that did not cause spontaneous contraction and was blocked by SQ 29548 but not by hexamethonium or by phentolamine. Methacholine-induced contractions were unaffected by U 46619. These results indicate that aggregating platelets, by releasing thromboxane A2, increase the airway contractile response to neural stimulation probably by the accelerated release of acetylcholine.\r"

We determined what effect perfusion pump-induced hemolysis has on the value of sigma determined by this technique in both the isolated canine left lower lung lobe (LLL) and forelimb by comparing estimates of sigma obtained before and after correction for hemolysis. Hemolysis was corrected by using the slopes of the relationships between hematocrit and plasma hemoglobin concentration and between the plasma protein and hemoglobin concentrations to correct hematocrit and protein concentration to a state of zero hemolysis. Uncorrected estimates of sigma in the LLL were 1.19 +/- 0.14 (SE) at a venous pressure (Pv) of 12 Torr (n = 7) and 0.90 +/- 0.02 at a Pv of 19 Torr (n = 6). Both sets of LLL's yielded sigma values of 0.77 +/- 0.03 after hemolysis correction. In the forelimb (n = 5), uncorrected and corrected estimates of sigma of 0.99 +/- 0.03 and 0.85 +/- 0.01, respectively, were obtained. The latter values were similar to sigma's (0.88 +/- 0.01) determined by lymph analysis in five additional forelimbs. We conclude that hemolysis results in overestimates of sigma. After hemolysis correction, this technique yields similar results to those obtained from lymph analysis for the forelimb and from published values for the LLL.\r"

The responses of the chemoreceptors to contraction were dependent on the arterial pressure response to this maneuver. When contraction reflexly evoked a pressor response of at least 20 mmHg, the discharge of 26 chemoreceptors was reduced from control levels by 53% (P less than 0.01). The contraction-induced inhibition of chemoreceptor discharge was prevented by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that also attenuated the contraction-induced pressor response. In addition, the inhibition evoked by contraction was simulated by injection of phenylephrine and inflation of an aortic balloon, both of which evoked pressor responses. However, when contraction failed to significantly change arterial pressure, the discharge of 20 aortic chemoreceptors was not significantly changed from control levels. We conclude that the reflex pressor response to static contraction inhibits the discharge of aortic chemoreceptors. This inhibition of discharge needs to be considered when interpreting the effects of aortic barodenervation on the cardiovascular responses to exercise.\r"

THIP and baclofen were administered to alpha-chloralose-anesthetized cats while minute ventilation (VE), arterial blood pressure (AP), and heart rate were monitored. THIP, in doses of 0.5 to 2 mg/kg decreased VE, tidal volume (VT), and AP. No changes in respiratory rate (f) or inspiratory (TI) or expiratory (TE) duration were observed. Baclofen, in doses of 0.5 to 4 mg/kg, decreased VE, f, and AP. VT and TI increased and an \"apneustic\" breathing pattern was seen. THIP (9.5 micrograms), applied bilaterally to the glycine-sensitive area of the ventral medulla, reproduced the effects seen with intravenous administration. Application of 10 micrograms of bicuculline bilaterally to this area reversed the effects of intravenous THIP but not those of baclofen. Baclofen (5.6-56 micrograms), administered by the intracisternal route, produced the same respiratory effects seen with intravenous administration. We conclude that activation of GABA alpha- and beta-receptors produces cardiorespiratory depression. However, this is accomplished by different mechanisms and by actions exerted at different central nervous system sites.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanical parameters of the respiratory system are often estimated from respiratory impedances using lumped-element inverse models. One such six-element model is composed of an airway branch [with a resistance (Raw) and inertance (Iaw)] separated from a tissue branch [with a resistance (Rt), inertance (It), and compliance (Ct)] by a shunt compliance representing alveolar gas compression (Cg). Even though the airways are known to have frequency-dependent resistance and inertance, these inverse models have been composed of linear frequency-independent elements. In this study we investigated the use of inverse models where the airway branch was represented by a frequency-independent Raw and Iaw, a Raw that is linearly related to frequency and an Iaw that is independent of frequency, and a system of identical parallel tubes the impedance of which was computed from the tube radius and length. These inverse models were used to analyze airway and respiratory impedances between 2 and 1,024 Hz that were predicted from an anatomically detailed forward model. The forward model represented the airways by an asymmetrically branched network with a terminal impedance representative of known Cg, Rt, It, and Ct. For respiratory impedances between 2 and 128 Hz, all models fit the data reasonably well, and reasonably accurate estimates of Cg, Rt, It, and Ct were extracted from these data. For data above 200 Hz, however, only the multiple-tube model accurately fitted respiratory impedances (Zrs). This model fitted the Zrs data best when composed of 27 tubes, each having a radius of 0.148 cm and a length of 16.5 cm.\r"

After anesthesia, sheep were exsanguinated and then studied by intra-arterial injection of one of the following materials: saline containing dyes of various colors (n = 24), Microfil (n = 8), or Batson's solution (n = 6). The systemic blood supply to the cervical trachea originated from the two common carotid arteries via three to four small branches (rami tracheales cervicales) on each side. A segment of the thoracic trachea between the thoracic inlet and the origin of the tracheal bronchus (bronchus trachealis) and the bronchial tree of the right cranial lobe (lobus cranialis dexter) were supplied by the tracheal bronchial branch (ramus bronchalis trachealis), which originated from the brachiocephalic trunk (truncus brachiocephalicus). A portion of thoracic trachea between the origin of the tracheal bronchus and the tracheal carina was supplied by the thoracic tracheal branch (ramus trachealis thoracica), arising from the bronchoesophageal artery (arteria bronchoesophagea) or directly from the thoracic aorta. The bronchial branch (ramus bronchalis) originated from the bronchoesophageal artery, and its branches supplied the remainder of the bronchial tree. At 120 cmH2O pressure (n = 8), the bronchial branch contributed approximately 50% and the other two approximately 25% each of the total tracheobronchial blood flow. These three branches also supplied the visceral pleura. Additionally, several small vessels (rami pleurales pulmonales) originated from the esophageal branch (ramus esophagea) of the bronchoesophageal artery, traversed the pulmonary ligaments, and supplied the visceral pleura.\r"

In addition, w was also measured during the VO2 transients from rest to each of the above work loads. Blood lactate concentration ([Lab]) was determined before and 8 min after the end of each priming load. After the onset of any priming load, w decreases with time reaching in 2 min a steady level that is lower the higher the VO2. For the three lowest work rates, the steady w level is unchanged by increasing the duration of the priming exercise up to 30 min. For low work levels, the decrease of w as a function of VO2 is essentially parallel to that of estimated muscle concentration of ATP ([ATP]). For work levels greater than 60% of VO2max involving a substantial accumulation of lactate, the decrease of w becomes smaller than the estimated drop of muscle [ATP]. This finding is tentatively attributed to an increase of either the mechanical equivalent or of the velocity constant of ATP splitting brought about by the lowering of intracellular muscle pH after lactate accumulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The percent of dpm in the lung homogenate accounted for by PC decreased progressively while dpm in lyso-PC, unsaturated PC, and aqueous soluble metabolites [choline, choline phosphate, glycerophosphorycholine, and cytidine 5'-diphosphate (CDP) choline (CDP-choline) increased. The dpm in microsomal and lamellar body fractions isolated from lung homogenates also increased progressively with time of perfusion. The presence of 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-BrcAMP) significantly stimulated both uptake of DPPC and the appearance of radioactivity in metabolites and subcellular organelles. This effect of 8-BrcAMP was not due to stimulation of phospholipase A activity. These results indicate that exogenous phospholipids instilled into the air spaces of rat lungs are internalized and degraded by a process that is stimulated by cAMP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acutely prepared animals (n = 9) were compared with animals with a chronic lung lymph fistula (n = 5). The osmotic reflection coefficients (sigma) for total protein, albumin, immunoglobins (Ig) G and M, and the equivalent pore dimensions were calculated. Data were achieved at maximal possible lymph flows (QL) following elevation of left atrial pressure. In sheep with a chronic lung lymph fistula sigma's for total protein, albumin, IgG, and IgM at maximal lymph flows were 0.76 +/- 0.01, 0.65 +/- 0.09, 0.79 +/- 0.03, and 0.91 +/- 0.01, respectively. In the acutely prepared group the minimum lymph-to-plasma protein concentration for total protein was 0.39 +/- 0.06, corresponding to a sigma of 0.61 +/- 0.01. The sigma for albumin, IgG, and IgM were 0.48 +/- 0.04, 0.64 +/- 0.02, and 0.87 +/- 0.01, respectively. The equivalent pore radii in the chronic group were determined to be 54 and 190 A with 29% of the filtration accounted for by large pores. In the acute group the small pores were 56 A and the large pores 175 A with 53% of total volume flow at maximum lymph flows occurring through the large pores. Assuming a constant small-pore population the large pore number increased 4.5 times after surgery. For total protein, IgG, and IgM, sigma's in the acutely prepared group were significantly lower than in the control group. These results thus indicate that surgical preparation of a lung lymph fistula in sheep may cause acute increases in pulmonary microvascular permeability.\r"

Before bronchoconstriction, large inflations resulted in only small changes of dynamic compliance (Cdyn) and pulmonary resistance (RL) in both groups of dogs. After the induction of a moderate degree of bronchoconstriction with aerosolized histamine, large inflations had a more substantial effect; Cdyn increased by 7.5 +/- 2.3% (mean +/- SE; P less than 0.05), and RL decreased by 32 +/- 3.4% (P less than 0.001) in the mongrel dogs. In the B-G group, Cdyn increased by only 0.2 +/- 1.8% (NS), and RL increased by 29.3 +/- 9.2% (P less than 0.05); these changes differed significantly (P less than 0.05) from those observed in the mongrel dogs. Large-volume ventilation following the administration of indomethacin (10 mg/kg iv) and histamine increased Cdyn by 11.4 +/- 1.8% (NS vs. without indomethacin) and decreased RL by 43.9 +/- 3.4% (P less than 0.05) in the mongrel group. In the B-G group large-volume ventilation increased Cdyn by 7.6 +/- 1.7% (P less than 0.01) and decreased RL by 15.7 +/- 8.1% (P less than 0.05). Thus indomethacin enhanced the bronchodilator effects of large-volume ventilation in mongrel dogs and reversed the bronchoconstrictor effect of this maneuver on RL in B-G dogs.\r"

With sustained increases in muscle length over the range 0.5-0.8 to 1.2 maximal length (Lmax), depolarization occurred, which was related to the amplitude of the length increase. Membrane depolarizations were also evoked after stretching to lengths approximately 1.1 Lmax and returning to the control length. Stretch-induced membrane depolarizations developed after the stretch maneuver was complete; were slowly reversible; were not influenced by tetrodotoxin or atropine; were related to stretch rather than to maintained increase in muscle length; were not transmitted to adjacent nonstretched segments of the trachea; and were often associated with slow waves which appear to be secondary to membrane depolarization rather than stretch per se.\r"

At any one speed, the stiffness may be reduced in a controlled fashion by running with the knees bent more than usual. In a series of experiments, subjects ran in both normal and flexed postures on a treadmill. In other experiments, they ran down a runway and over a force platform. Results show that running with the knees bent reduces the effective vertical stiffness and diminishes the transmission of mechanical shock from the foot to the skull but requires an increase of as much as 50% in the rate of O2 consumption. A new dimensionless parameter (u omega 0/g) is introduced to distinguish between hard and soft running modes. Here, omega 0 is the natural frequency of a mass-spring system representing the body, g is gravity, and u is the vertical landing velocity. In normal running, this parameter is near unity, but in deep-flexed running, where the aerial phase of the stride cycle almost disappears, u omega 0/g approaches zero.\r"

Compared with age-matched controls (CON), soleus wet weights of suspended rats were significantly decreased (approximately 49%). In HS rats, the light adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) fibers (staining lightly for myosin ATPase, pH = 8.8) atrophied more than the dark ATPase fibers (staining darkly for myosin ATPase, pH = 8.8). Single-fiber alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activities and the proportion of dark ATPase fibers were higher in HS than CON rats. Daily forceful lengthening contractions did not prevent the suspension-induced changes. These results considered in conjunction with a collaborative study on the mechanical properties of HS rats (Roy et al., accompanying paper) suggest a shift in the contractile potential of the muscle following HS without a deficit in SDH, a metabolic property commonly associated with resistance to fatigue. The results support the view that soleus muscle fibers can change from a slow-twitch oxidative to a fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic profile, but rarely to a fast-twitch glycolytic one, and that SDH and GPD activity per volume of tissue can be maintained or increased even when there are severe losses of contractile proteins.\r"

The present study was designed to investigate these effects in single fibers. Fiber type and size and the activities of two metabolic marker enzymes were determined in a deep (close to the bone) and a superficial (away from the bone) region of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and the tibialis anterior (TA) of control (CON) and 28-day HS adult female rats. Fibers were classified as dark or light adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) based on their qualitative staining reaction for myosin ATPase following alkaline preincubation. Fiber area and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) activities were determined in tissue sections by use of an image analysis system. After 28 days of HS, the mean body weights of the CON and HS were similar. MG atrophied 28%, whereas TA weight was maintained in the HS. Both dark and light ATPase fibers in the deep region of the MG had smaller cross-sectional areas following HS, with the atrophic response being approximately twice as great in the light ATPase fibers. No significant changes in fiber type composition in either muscle or in fiber sizes in the superficial region of the MG or in either region of the TA were observed. Mean SDH activities of both fiber types were significantly lower in the MG and TA following HS. In contrast, mean GPD activities were either increased or maintained in light and dark ATPase fibers of both muscles in HS. Changes in SDH and GPD activity could not be directly linked to changes in fiber cross-sectional area. In summary, these data suggest an independence of the mechanisms determining muscle fiber size and metabolic adaptations associated with HS.\r"

An excellent correlation (r = 0.80) was found between the fall of alveolar O2 tensions (delta PETo2) and body weight, expressed as the ratio of weight to height (wt/ht, kg/cm). An even greater correlation (r = 0.89) was found between delta PETo2 and the ratio of breath-hold time X O2 consumption/FRC. Alveolar Po2 decreased to 70 mmHg in the obese group after just 15 s of apnea, whereas this degree of hypoxia did not occur in the nonobese until the breath hold was sustained for 30 s. This variable rate of fall of alveolar Po2 during a breath hold can be ascribed to the changes of O2 consumption (Vo2) and FRC associated with changing body weight. In the obese, Vo2/FRC was twice as large as in the nonobese, thus accounting for the differences of breath-hold time needed to obtain the same alveolar Po2. Sao2 measured at the end of the breath hold was the same as that value predicted from the reduction of PETo2. This suggests that the fall of alveolar Po2 can entirely account for the observed fall of O2 saturation and that venous admixture had not increased during the 15-s apnea. In patients with sleep apnea, the ratio of Vo2/(initial lung volume) may also be an important determinant of the severity of hypoxemia observed.\r"

The results were compared with the pressure-diameter behavior of airways in a lung region adjacent to the collaterally ventilating segment. Airways in each lung region were dusted with powdered tantalum, and airway diameters were measured during homogeneous and nonhomogeneous lobe inflation. Intrasegmental and extrasegmental airways behaved similarly during homogeneous lobe inflation; airway diameter increased as alveolar pressure increased. The lobe was inflated nonhomogeneously by raising pressure in the collaterally ventilating segment (Ps) while maintaining pressure at the lobar bronchus (Pao) constant at 5, 10, or 15 cmH2O. Increasing Ps at constant Pao reciprocally affected intrasegmental and extrasegmental airways. When Pao was low, intrasegmental airways were expanded, and extrasegmental airways were compressed when Ps was raised. When Pao was high, airway diameter was unaffected by increasing Ps presumably because the airways were already maximally expanded. A comparison of diameters during homogenous and nonhomogenous lobe inflation suggests a very small interdependence effect from the parenchyma surrounding the collaterally ventilating segment. These results demonstrate the combined effects of parenchymal properties and airway pressure-diameter relationships in determining the effect of local lung distortion on airway function.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution between carnitine and the acyl derivatives of carnitine reflects changes in the metabolic state of a variety of tissues. Patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) develop skeletal muscle ischemia with exertion. This impairment in oxidative metabolism during exercise may result in the generation of acylcarnitines. To test this hypothesis, 11 patients with PVD and 7 age-matched control subjects were evaluated with graded treadmill exercise. Subjects with PVD walked to maximal claudication pain at a peak O2 consumption (VO2) of 19.9 +/- 1.3 ml X kg-1 X min-1 (mean +/- SE). Control subjects were taken to a near-maximal work load at a VO2 of 31.3 +/- 1.0 ml X kg-1 X min-1. In patients with PVD, the plasma concentration of total acid-soluble, long-chain acylcarnitine and total carnitine was increased at peak exercise compared with resting values. Four minutes postexercise, the plasma short-chain acylcarnitine concentration was also increased. In control subjects taken to the higher work load, only the long-chain acylcarnitine concentration was increased at peak exercise. In patients with PVD, plasma short-chain acylcarnitine concentration at rest was negatively correlated with subsequent maximal walking time (r = -0.51, P less than 0.05). In conclusion, acylcarnitines increased in patients with PVD who walked to maximal claudication pain, whereas control subjects did not show equivalent changes even when taken to a higher work load. The relationship between short-chain acylcarnitine concentration at rest and subsequent exercise performance suggests that repeated episodes of ischemia may cause chronic accumulation of short-chain acylcarnitine in plasma in proportion to the severity of disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tracheal lung sounds were measured in six healthy subjects during forced expiration through a flow-limiting valve in series with a high-impedance suction pump. Mouth pressure, esophageal pressure, transpulmonary pressure (Ptp), flow (V), and volume were also measured. For any flow rate, V was constant until the subject became flow limited. The onset of flow limitation was documented by a small change in V and a sudden change in Ptp, which was previously found by Olafsson and Hyatt to correspond to the beginning of the flow plateau of the isovolume pressure-flow curve (J. Clin. Invest. 48: 564-573, 1969). FEW started 107 +/- 45 ml (SD) after the onset of flow limitation. Additional 79 +/- 65 ml were exhaled between the onset of FEW to the final sharp drop in V. The frequency spectra of FEW were the same as those of respiratory wheezes found in obstructive airway diseases. Administration of inhaled bronchodilator (isoproterenol) did not eliminate the FEW, nor did it change their relationship to flow limitation. The sequence of events around the onset of FEW, and the tight correlation with the onset of flow limitation correspond well to recent experimental observations on the onset of flutter in collapsible, thick-walled latex tubes.\r"

Test frequencies were 5, 7, 9, and 11 Hz with tidal volume kept constant at 2.5 ml/kg. During HFO application to the abdomen, we observed significantly higher arterial O2 partial pressure (P less than 0.05) at 5, 7, and 9 Hz and lower arterial CO2 partial pressure (P less than 0.05) at 7, 9, and 11 Hz than with rib cage or whole-body HFO. There was no significant difference in blood gases between rib cage and whole-body HFO. Thus, using blood gases as an index of ventilatory effectiveness, the present study showed that HFO applied at the abdomen was the most effective of the three kinds of body surface HFO. In comparison to rib cage or whole-body application, abdominal HFO was accompanied by substantial paradoxical movement of the diaphragm and rib cage. The associated lung distortion may result in pendelluft, which in turn may be the mechanism for increased ventilatory effectiveness with abdominal application of HFO.\r"

When we increased left atrial pressure to 42.9 +/- 5.7 (SD) cmH2O (base line = 6.6 +/- 4.6 cmH2O), the lungs became edematous and QLV increased from a base line of 20.4 +/- 21.5 microliters/min to 388 +/- 185 microliters/min. QLV plateaued at the higher level. We also measured the relationship between lymph flow rate and the height of the outflow end of the lymph cannula. From this relationship, determined at the end of the period of elevated left atrial pressure, we calculated the effective resistance and pressure driving lymph from the lungs. We also cannulated lymph vessels in the downstream direction and estimated the effective resistance and pressure opposing flow into the part of the lymphatic system between the lung hilus and the veins (extrapulmonary lymph vessels). We found that the effective resistance of the extrapulmonary part of the lymph system (0.042 +/- 0.030 (SD) cmH2O X min X microliter-1) was large compared with the resistance of the lymph vessels from the lungs (0.026 +/- 0.027). These data indicate that the resistance of the extrapulmonary part of the lung lymph system limits the maximum flow of lymph from edematous lungs.\r"

Five animals were then infused with 0.9% sodium chloride (saline), five with 5% human serum albumin (albumin), and five with 6% hydroxyethyl starch (hetastarch) to increase the pulmonary arterial occlusive pressure by 10 Torr in comparison to the postplasmapheresis level for a 5-h study interval. On completion of the procedure, the lungs were harvested and EVLW measured by the blood-free gravimetric technique. Three to six times the volume of saline compared with albumin or hetastarch (P less than 0.001) was infused. In the saline animals, COP was decreased to 3.3 +/- 1.3 Torr, whereas COP was increased to 18.1 +/- 1.4 Torr in albumin animals (P less than 0.001) and 20.1 +/- 1.6 Torr in the hetastarch group (P less than 0.001). The saline-treated dogs developed gross signs of systemic edema. The EVLW was 8.1 +/- 0.9 ml/kg in saline animals compared with 5.3 +/- 2.1 ml/kg in the albumin (P less than 0.05) and 4.1 +/- 1.4 ml/kg in the hetastarch (P less than 0.01) groups.

Dissipative limitation is also investigated. Viscous limitation can occur if n1 is greater than 0.5, and turbulent limitation can occur if n1 is not less than 0.4. For values of n1 less than 0.4, flow cannot be limited at negative pressures. Model simulations are used to show that a combination of a value of n1 less than 0.3 together with an area minimum in the bronchial tree produce a minimum (a \"hook\") in the flow-volume curve.

  ".W": "Experiments were performed in eight lightly anesthetized thiopental sodium (Pentothal) cats to examine whether diaphragmatic afferents can significantly alter the neural drive to the diaphragm when the animal is exposed to lower body negative pressure. Moving-time-averaged diaphragmatic electromyograms (EMGma) were recorded and compared before and during exposure to lower body negative pressure in each of three consecutive conditions: C7 spinalization, bilateral vagotomy, and cervical dorsal rhizotomy. Application of lower body negative pressure in C7-spinalized animals resulted in a decrease in inspiratory time and peak diaphragmatic activity compared with control levels. After bilateral vagotomy, EMGma activity was prolonged with the application of lower body negative pressure. However, there was no increase in peak EMGma activity. After transection of the cervical dorsal roots subserving the phrenic nerve, the prolongation of diaphragmatic activity negative was eliminated. Therefore, we conclude that the significant increase in duration of inspiration in response to application of lower body negative pressure in the C7-spinalized, bilaterally vagotomized cat is mediated by phrenic nerve afferents.\r"

  ".W": "We measured mitochondrial enzyme activities in skeletal muscle under conditions of iron deficiency and endurance training to assess the effects of these interventions on the contents and proportions of non-iron-containing and iron-dependent enzymes and proteins. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 21 days of age, received a diet containing either 6 (iron deficient) or 50 mg iron/kg diet (iron sufficient). At 35 days of age animals were subdivided into sedentary and endurance training groups (running at 0.7 mph, 0% grade, 45 min/day, 6 days/wk). By 70 days of age, iron deficiency had decreased gastrocnemius muscle cytochrome c by 62% in sedentary animals. In contrast, the activities of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes were increased, remained unchanged or were slightly decreased, indicating that iron deficiency markedly altered mitochondrial composition. Endurance training increased cytochrome c (35%), tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes (approximately 15%), and manganese superoxide dismutase (33%) in iron-deficient rats, whereas the same exercise regimen had no effect on the skeletal muscle of iron-sufficient animals. The interactive effect of dietary iron deficiency and mild exercise on mitochondrial enzymes suggests that adaptation to a training stimulus is, to some extent, geared to the relationship between the energy demand of exercise and the capacity for O2 transport and utilization.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously presented evidence that cultured alveolar epithelial cell monolayers actively transport sodium from medium to substratum, a process that can be inhibited by sodium transport blockers and stimulated by beta-agonists. In this study, the isolated perfused rat lung was utilized in order to investigate the presence of active sodium transport by intact adult mammalian alveolar epithelium. Radioactive tracers (22Na and [14C]sucrose) were instilled into the airways of isolated Ringer-perfused rat lungs whose weight was continuously monitored. The appearance of isotopes in the recirculated perfusate was measured, and fluxes and apparent permeability-surface area products were determined. A pharmacological agent (amiloride, ouabain, or terbutaline) was added to the perfusate during each experiment after a suitable control period. Amiloride and ouabain resulted in decreased 22Na fluxes and a faster rate of lung weight gain. Terbutaline resulted in increased 22Na flux and a more rapid rate of lung weight loss. [14C]sucrose fluxes were unchanged by the presence of these pharmacological agents. These data are most consistent with the presence of a regulable active component of sodium transport across intact mammalian alveolar epithelium that leads to removal of sodium from the alveolar space, with anions and water following passively. Regulation of the rate of sodium and fluid removal from the alveolar space may play an important role in the prevention and/or resolution of alveolar pulmonary edema.\r"

Intact and carotid-denervated (CD) conscious cats were exposed to ambient hypoxia (low inspired O2 fraction) or CO hypoxia in prevailing laboratory (23-25 degrees C) or cold (5-8 degrees C) environments. In the cold, both groups promptly decreased shivering and body temperature when exposed to either type of hypoxia. Small increases in CO2 concentration reinstituted shivering in both groups. At the same inspired concentration of O2, CD animals decreased shivering and body temperature more than intact cats. While this difference resulted, in part, from a lower alveolar PO2 in CD cats, a difference between intact and CD cats was apparent when the two groups were compared at the same alveolar PO2. During more prolonged hypoxia (45 min), shivering returned but did not reach normoxic levels, and body temperature tended to stabilize at a hypothermic value. Exposure to various levels of hypoxia produced graded suppression of shivering, with the result that the change in body temperature varied directly with inspired O2 concentration. Hypoxia appears to act on the central nervous system to suppress shivering and sinus nerve afferents appear to counteract this direct effect of hypoxia. In intact cats, this counteraction appears to be sufficient to maintain body temperature under hypoxic conditions at room temperature but not in the cold.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative assessment of lung metabolic function is thought to provide biochemical information reflecting integrity of the pulmonary microcirculation. Although multiple indicator-dilution techniques are useful in such pharmacokinetic studies, the need for fractionation and subsequent processing of blood samples greatly prolongs data generation. Accordingly, we designed and tested an in-line system which rapidly can quantify single-pass disposition of photon-emitting substances in the pulmonary circulation of intact animals. The nuclear detection system consisted of a phoswich scintillation probe optically coupled to a photomultiplier tube. Pulses were discriminated for height and shape and counts recorded in a counter-timer, the output of which was interfaced with a personal computer. A mixture of an intravascular reference substance (99mTc-sulfur colloid) and an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, N-[1(S)-carboxy-(4-OH-3-[125I]-phenyl) ethyl]-L-alanyl-L-proline (125I-CPAP), was injected as a bolus in the right heart of anesthetized ventilated rabbits and arterial blood was diverted through a flow-cell cuvette directly apposed to the phoswich detector. Single-pass extraction of 125I-CPAP was 39 +/- 3% (mean +/- SE; n = 20) and was depressed in a dose-dependent fashion by the addition of unlabeled CPAP (1-10 micrograms/kg) to the injection. These data indicate that we can now quantify, in the intact animal, saturable binding of an inhibitor to angiotensin-converting enzyme expressed on the surface of the pulmonary microvascular endothelium. Furthermore, such data can be obtained rapidly.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that, regardless of fiber type, skeletal muscles composed of regenerating fibers adapt more readily than muscles composed of surviving fibers when placed in an atypical site with atypical innervation. Fast muscles of rats were autografted into the site of slow muscles or vice versa with the donor muscle innervated by the motor nerve to the recipient site. Surviving fibers in donor muscles were obtained by grafting with vasculature intact (vascularized muscle graft), and regenerating fibers were obtained by grafting with vasculature severed (free muscle graft). Our hypothesis was supported because 60 days after grafting, transposed muscles with surviving fibers demonstrated only a slight change from the contractile properties and fiber typing of donor muscles, whereas transplanted muscles with regenerating fibers demonstrated almost complete change to those of the muscle formerly in the atypical site.\r"

Occlusion for six hours resulted in necrosis of trabecular bone and of intertrabecular marrow and vascular tissue, later followed by revascularisation and repair, as has been demonstrated previously. In contrast, raised intra-articular pressure lasting for only two hours resulted in a more complex picture: trabecular osteocytes were dead, whereas the bone-forming marrow was shown by fluorochrome labelling to remain viable, and to form appositional repair bone throughout the epiphysis. We concluded that transient vascular occlusion may cause the death of trabeculae despite intact perfusion of the bone. This type of change may be important in the pathogenesis of Perthes' disease.\r"

When both S2 roots were preserved, sphincter problems were mild and reversible. One patient died from recurrence 32 months after operation and one was lost to follow-up at eight months.

Tethering the thoracic spine into the form of an asymmetric lordosis produces a slowly progressive structural scoliosis by purely mechanical means.

This release, however, was performed with an electric soldering iron and subsequent study showed that in those animals with severe progressive deformity there was localised spinal cord damage. We suggest that it is this neural damage and not the muscle release which leads to rapid progression. The clinical implications are important in that neurological dysfunction seems to render the spinal column less able to resist mechanical buckling and may be the crucial factor differentiating severely progressive from more benign curves.\r"

We discuss the indications, technique, complications and results of the method.\r"

Radiographs of 20 knees were studied; with the patient supine and the muscles relaxed, views with the knee at full extension and 90 degrees of flexion were obtained and the movement of the meniscal bearings over this range of flexion was measured. The bearings were found to move backwards on the tibia through an average distance of 4.4 mm (range 0.0 to 13.5 mm) in the medial compartment and 6.0 mm (range 1.6 to 13.0 mm) in the lateral compartment. These movements were in the same direction as that observed in cadaver specimens but smaller in magnitude. At 90 degrees of flexion, radiographs were obtained with the tibia twisted manually to the limits of medial and lateral rotation. The average movement of the bearings between these extremes was found to be 6.6 mm in the medial compartment and 5.1 mm in the lateral; their movements on the tibia were in opposite directions in the two compartments. Bearing movement was still present in knees examined five years after operation.\r"

In 61 normal volunteers we found no significant left to right differences in anterior laxity at 200 N and anterior stiffness at 50 N. In 92 patients with unilateral anterior cruciate deficiency there were significant differences (p less than 0.0005) in anterior laxity, anterior stiffness and total laxity, the injured-normal differences averaging 6.7 mm, 1.3 N/mm, and 8.1 mm respectively.\r"

However, the ipsilateral distal growth plate grew faster than the contralateral between 12 and 18 days after operation, which appeared to be related to increased cell proliferation and height. Proximal osteotomy led to an increase in growth rates proximally which was more marked on the contralateral side. The lesser response of the ipsilateral growth plate may have been due to local impairment of blood supply, or to greater local release of metabolites after bony damage. Distal tibial osteotomy gave similar results to circumferential release of the distal tibial periosteum. Proximal osteotomy, however, produced a relative impairment of growth on the operated side. This may be of importance in the correction of childhood deformities associated with inequality of leg length.\r"

The fibronectin is incorporated in the framework of the seminal gel formed during the immediate postejaculatory phase, whereas the lactoferrin remains in solution. In the seminal gel fibronectin is linked to its predominant structural protein, a high molecular weight seminal vesicle protein (semenogelin). Both the gel-bound fibronectin and semenogelin are progressively fragmented and solubilized by the abundant prostatic kallikrein-like protease (prostate-specific antigen) during and after seminal gel liquefaction.

DEAE-cellulose chromatography of endogenously labeled mucin glycoproteins from explant tissue demonstrated the presence of six mucin species (I-VI) similar to those identified earlier in surgical specimens of human colonic tissue. The relative proportions of mucin species I-VI in tissue explants remained constant throughout a 30-h culture period. However, the proportional representation of the various mucin species in media was significantly different from that found in tissue, which suggests that some mucin species (I, II, and III) are differentially secreted, whereas others (IV and V) are retained within intracellular pools. Radiolabeled precursors were incorporated into mucin species I, II, and III at a 2.0-2.6-fold greater rate than their concentration in tissue, supporting the concept that these glycoproteins were both synthesized and secreted at a greater rate than species IV and V. Colonic mucosal explants from patients with ulcerative colitis showed greater than 90% reduction of species IV. However, the amount of species IV recovered from culture media of ulcerative colitis explants was comparable to normal controls. It appears that mucin species IV is differentially secreted rather than retained within intracellular pools in mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.\r"

LPL activity correlated indirectly with lipemia, triglyceride content of HDL2, HL activity, and levels of HDL2 but not of HDL3. HL activity correlated directly with lipemia and indirectly with HDL2 levels. Triglyceride content of HDL2 correlated directly with lipemia and indirectly with HDL2 levels. In HDL2, abundance of apolipoprotein (apo) A-II and the apoA-I/apoA-II ratio varied widely. The latter correlated positively with LPL activity and HDL2 levels, and, inversely, with HL activity, lipemia, and triglyceride content of HDL2. The study suggests that HDL-cholesterol is not an independent parameter of lipid transport, but is strongly affected by triglyceride metabolism through lipolytic enzymes, as exemplified by postprandial lipemia that affect both composition and plasma levels of HDL2.\r"

All doses (0.5-50 nmol/100 g body wt) stimulated sodium absorption. Distal sodium absorption did not saturate at dexamethasone levels that saturate the glucocorticoid receptor but also bind to greater than 35% of aldosterone receptors. Saturation of the pure glucocorticoid response occurred in both segments with RU26988, a synthetic glucocorticoid that does not occupy aldosterone receptors. Maximum velocities for pure glucocorticoid-induced sodium absorption were 15 and 16 mu eq/min per g dry tissue, and Michaelis constants (Km) were 4.2 and 4.6 X 10(-9) mol/liter for proximal and distal colon. Kms are similar to the dissociation constant for the colonic glucocorticoid receptor and too low for significant aldosterone receptor occupancy. Dexamethasone increased sodium absorption significantly within 30 min of injection, suggesting the response is not dependent on new protein synthesis. Similar time and dose responses in proximal and distal colon suggest glucocorticoids stimulate the same pathway in both segments.\r"

  ".W": "Morphological and biochemical studies of human colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-E) have been hindered by their extreme rarity. Since burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) develop into CFU-E, we used normal human blood BFU-E to generate large numbers of highly purified CFU-E in vitro. Using density centrifugation, sheep erythrocyte rosetting, surface immunoglobulin-positive cell depletion, adherence to plastic, and negative panning with monoclonal antibodies, human blood BFU-E were purified from 0.017 to 0.368%, a 22-fold purification with a 43% yield. The panned cells were cultured in methylcellulose with recombinant erythropoietin (rEp) and conditioned medium for 9 d. These cells were then collected and CFU-E were further purified using adherence and density centrifugation. This yielded almost 10(7) erythroid colony forming cells with a purity of 70 +/- 18%. Analysis of these cells by light and electron microscopy showed 94% erythroid cells. The prominent cell was a primitive blast with high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, dispersed nuclear chromatin and a distinct large nucleolus. The relation between the number of erythroid colonies and the number of day 9 cells plated in plasma clots was a straight line through the origin with a maximum number of erythroid colonies at 1 U/ml of rEp and no erythroid colonies without rEp. Specific binding with 125I-rEp showed that 60% of the binding was inhibited by excess pure erythropoietin (Ep), but not by albumin, fetal calf serum, and a variety of growth factors or glycoproteins. By days 12-13 of cell culture, when the progenitor cells matured to late erythroblasts, specific binding markedly declined. In this study, human CFU-E have been isolated in sufficient purity to characterize the morphology of these rare cells and in sufficient numbers to measure specific binding of Ep.\r"

Both the rate of cholesterol esterification and the accumulation of CE were increased within 24 h of the co-culture of adherent macrophages with platelets. Maximum increases in esterification and CE accumulation were observed within 3 to 4 d of culture and were greater than 10-fold over controls. Optimum accumulation of CE by 5 X 10(5) was obtained with 5 X 10(8) autologous platelets. When similar amounts of free cholesterol were supplied with platelets, red blood cells (RBC), RBC ghosts, or sonicated RBC, only platelets enhanced macrophage CE accumulation, which indicates specificity for platelets. Products released from platelets 30 min after thrombin stimulation were active as well. The results suggest that platelets and/or substances shed by activated platelets are potent mediators of macrophage CE accumulation.\r"

The beta-globin gene with either 1,600 or 127 basepairs of beta promoter sequence was not expressed after stable introduction into K562 cells, consistent with the known inactivity of the beta-globin gene in these cells. In contrast, a gamma/beta promoter composed of a gamma fragment spanning positions -408 to -137 joined to the 127-bp beta promoter was able to drive the beta-globin gene. The gene appeared to be inducible with hemin. A zeta-globin 5' flanking fragment also activated the beta promoter. The function of a series of composite gamma/beta promoters was then assessed by their ability to drive directly the neomycin resistance gene, again in stably transformed cells. The -408 to -137 gamma fragment activated the beta promoter in an orientation-specific manner in this assay. Deletion analysis showed that regulatory sequences were present between positions -259 and -137 of the fetal gamma-globin gene flanking region.\r"

  ".W": "We measured H2O2 release by human alveolar macrophages (AM) from normals and sarcoid patients in suspension immediately after bronchoalveolar lavage in the presence and absence of the triggering agent, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). AM from 11 sarcoid patients produced a mean (+/- SE) of 21.7 +/- 2.3 and 5.9 +/- 3.4 nmol H2O2/10(6) macrophages in the presence and absence of PMA, respectively. By contrast, AM from normals (n = 6) produced 9.8 +/- 1.7 and 1.6 +/- 0.7 nmol H2O2/10(6) macrophages with and without PMA, respectively. Macrophage activation, as monitored by H2O2 production, did not correlate with the angiotensin-converting enzyme levels, the result of gallium-67 scans, or the percent of lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage. To determine whether AM from normals could be stimulated to increase their H2O2 production to the level seen in patients with sarcoid, we measured H2O2 released by adherent AM after incubation in each of four potential activating agents: recombinant interferons alpha A, beta, gamma (rIFN alpha A, rIFN beta, and rIFN gamma, respectively), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. H2O2 release in the range seen in sarcoid patients could be induced in PMA-triggered AM from normals by rIFN gamma in a time- (t1/2 approximately 1 d) and dose-dependent fashion (threefold increase, EC50 5 antiviral U/ml) and by rIFN alpha A and rIFN beta at higher concentrations, but not by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.\r"

Liver was freeze-clamped at 90 and 180 min, and perchloric acid extracts of the liver were subjected to 13C and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Dilution in the oxaloacetate pool was determined by comparing the intrahepatic 13C enrichments of C2, C3 positions of glutamate with the C2, C3 positions of alanine and lactate. In addition steady state flux equations were derived for calculation of relative fluxes through pyruvate dehydrogenase/TCA cycle flux and pyruvate kinase flux/total pyruvate utilization. After glucose ingestion in a 24-h fasted rat direct conversion of glucose was responsible for 34% of glycogen. The intrahepatic dilution factor for labeled pyruvate in the oxaloacetate pool was 2.4. Using this factor, alanine and lactate contributed approximately 55% to glycogen formation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase flux ranged between 24 and 35% of total acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) production and pyruvate kinase flux relative to total pyruvate utilization was approximately 40%.\r"

  ".U": "87280709\r", 
  ".W": "Although 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo and in organ culture, the mechanism by which it effects this stimulation is unknown. We have recently found that the agent does not stimulate resorption by osteoclasts mechanically disaggregated from bone and incubated on slices of cortical bone. This suggests that the osteoclasts were removed by disaggregation from the influence of some cell type, present in intact bone, that mediates hormone responsiveness. We therefore tested the ability of osteoblastic cells derived from neonatal rat calvariae and of cloned, hormone-responsive osteosarcoma cells (UMR106) to restore hormone responsiveness to unresponsive populations of osteoclasts. We found that osteoblastic cells from both sources induced a two- to fourfold stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Stimulation was observed at concentrations of 10(-10) M and above. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide did not affect bone resorption by osteoclasts incubated alone, but abolished the capacity of osteoblastic cells to stimulate osteoclastic resorption in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. When calvarial cells or osteoblastlike UMR cells were incubated with the hormone, they produced a factor in cell-free supernatants that stimulated bone resorption by disaggregated osteoclasts. These experiments suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 stimulates bone resorption through a primary action on osteoblastic cells, that are induced by the hormone to produce a factor that stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption.\r"

Six of the patients had identical two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps. These differed from the normal apo E3 map by the altered mobility of a single peptide. Amino acid analysis and sequencing showed that apo E2 in these patients had a substitution of 158 Arg----Cys. The presence of this mutation in six of the seven type III patients confirms that this is the most common form of apo E2. The seventh type III patient had a unique map with a new peptide resulting from a substitution of 136 Arg----Ser. He was heterozygous for this and for the more common apo E2 (158 Arg----Cys) variant. His very low-density lipoprotein contained approximately five times more apo E2 (136 Arg----Ser) than apo E2 (158 Arg----Cys), as determined by cysteamine treatment and peptide mapping. This new apo E2 mutant thus appears to contribute significantly to the patient's hyperlipidemia.\r"

Hyperthyroid cat goiters contain single or multiple hyperplastic nodules, consisting of highly cellular tissue with an iodine metabolism exceeding that of the surrounding normal tissue. Xenografts of hyperplastic hot tissue in thyroxine-treated nude mice retain their original histologic pattern and continue to accumulate radioiodine intensely. Autoradiographs assessed for [3H]thymidine incorporation reveal autonomously proliferating follicular cells within the hyperplastic foci but not within the normal tissue. Administration of sera from donor cats into host mice fails to stimulate the xenografts. Neither hyperfunction nor growth of toxic cat goiters depends on extrathyroidal stimulators. The basic lesion appears to be an excessive intrinsic growth capacity of some thyroid cells.\r"

In both groups results of kinetic modeling were consistent with the hypothesis that all apo B enters the plasma in VLDL, mainly as B,E particles, followed by delipidation and partial conversion to IDL and LDL, with concomitant conversion of some B,E particles to B particles. In WHHL rabbits, production of VLDL apo B was reduced by 40%, but LDL production was increased threefold. Defective removal of B,E and B particles in all three lipoprotein classes, coupled with preserved processes of delipidation, can account for the observed increases in the concentration of apo B (threefold in VLDL, fivefold in IDL, and twenty-twofold in LDL) in WHHL rabbits.\r"

In a subset of patients with the autosomal dominant form of HS, spectrin displays a reduced capacity to bind protein 4.1 and, therefore, actin; both functions that are critical to the membrane skeleton. A specific structural defect has not been identified in the spectrin from these patients. Chymotryptic digestion of the isolated spectrin chains shows impaired cleavage of the distal peptide of the beta subunit, the beta IV domain. In previous work, we have shown that mild oxidation markedly diminishes the binding capacity of normal spectrin for protein 4.1. Here we observe that chemical reduction of freshly isolated, untreated HS spectrin dramatically improves its function. Thus, a primary structural defect in the beta subunit of spectrin in this subtype of HS may lead to oxidant sensitivity, and secondarily, to a functional defect in the binding of spectrin to protein 4.1 and actin.\r"

Among the whole study group, the sum of the subscripts of apoE phenotype (e.g., E2/3 = 5) was correlated positively with the fractional absorption of cholesterol (r = 0.40; P less than 0.05) and negatively with the serum level of lathosterol, a cholesterol precursor sterol reflecting the activity of cholesterol synthesis (r = -0.48; P less than 0.01).

Using the rabbit reticulocyte membrane as a model of the immature red cell membrane, we investigated the effects of human recombinant erythropoietin on membrane Ca2+-ATPase (calcium pump) activity in vitro. Erythropoietin in a concentration range of 0.025 to 3.0 U/ml progressively decreased membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity by up to 64% (P less than 0.01). These concentrations have been shown by others to stimulate in vitro erythroid growth. The action of erythropoietin on reticulocyte Ca2+-ATPase required an incubation time of 1 h before enzyme assay for maximum effect and was neutralized by antierythropoietin antiserum. Other nonhemopoietic growth factors (epidermal growth factor, insulin) had no effect in this assay. Ca2+-ATPase activity of membranes prepared from rabbit mature red blood cells was not inhibited by erythropoietin. The novel effect of erythropoietin on reticulocyte membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity is a mechanism by which erythropoietin can influence cellular Ca2+ metabolism.\r"

In control studies, 10 microU/ml AVP increased Lp (mean +/- SE, X 10(-7) centimeters/atmosphere per second) from 4.4 +/- 0.9 to 166.0 +/- 10.4. Pretreatment with dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8) suppressed AVP stimulated peak Lp (peak Lp, 21.9 +/- 3.1). Pretreatment with 10(-9) and 10(-7) M 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) also blocked the increase in Lp in a dose-dependent fashion (peak Lp, 59.3 +/- 7.5 and 18.6 +/- 4.8, respectively). Inactive phorbol ester, 4 alpha-phorbol 12 beta,13 alpha-didecanoate (10(-7) M), had no effect. PMA also suppressed the increase in Lp induced by 10(-4) M 8-p-chlorophenylthio-cyclic AMP (CcAMP): peak Lp was 169.4 +/- 14.9 in control, 79.2 +/- 5.5 with 10(-9) M PMA, and 25.7 +/- 2.9 with 10(-7) M PMA. Furthermore, when 10(-7) M PMA was added to the bath 10 min after exposure to AVP, the Lp response to AVP was blocked. Peak Lp was 52.4 +/- 9.6 with PMA vs. 165.1 +/- 10.0 in control. Phosphatidic acid (PA), which is thought to stimulate phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover, produced similar inhibitory effects on AVP as well as CcAMP-stimulated Lp: PA suppressed 10-microU/ml AVP-induced peak Lp from a control value of 159.6 +/- 7.9 to 88.9 +/- 15.8, and 10(-4) M CcAMP induced peak Lp from 169.4 +/- 14.9 to 95.5 +/- 7.7. We conclude that PMA, at concentrations known to specifically activate PKC, suppresses the hydroosmotic effect of AVP on CCT; This suppression is primarily a post-cAMP event; Inhibition of AVP-stimulated Lp by DiC8 and PA also suggests an inhibitory role for the PKC system; The ability of pre- and post-AVP administration of PMA to blunt the AVP response suggests that agents that act through modulation of PI turnover in CCT may regulate the hydroosmotic effect of AVP.\r"

There was a significant increase in acute inflammatory scores in ulcerative colitis compared with those in familial adenomatous polyposis, and pouchitis was present only in patients who had had ulcerative colitis; the morphological features of pouchitis are similar to those seen in the colorectal mucosa in ulcerative colitis.

Tissues from 137 patients with other conditions served as controls. Within the main study a smaller investigation was performed to compare sections from the left and right colon in the same subject. Several well known histochemical techniques were used to investigate possible changes in sulphation, sialic acid structure (loss of O-acetyl substituents), and changes in the ratio of sialic acid to neutral sugars. In patients with FAP, as in controls, there was increased expression of periodic acid Schiff positive mucin and fucose in the right colon. The only difference between patients with FAP and controls was the indirect demonstration of less neutral mucin in the right colon in FAP, but this did not seem to affect neutral sugars binding to UEA-1, PNL, or HPA. As in the general population, a small proportion of patients with FAP showed a lack of O-acetyl substituted sialic acid. Sialic acid heterogeneity probably has a genetic basis, but this is not associated with the genetic defect underlying FAP.\r"

The case of a young adult who developed a bronchioloalveolar carcinoma associated with a cystic congenital adenomatoid malformation is reported. The adjacent lung showed an unusual intra-alveolar hyperplasia of mucous cells. Two further cases of congenital adenomatoid malformation are also described; both patients presented in infancy and showed similar mucous cell hyperplasia in alveoli surrounding the cysts. In all three cases the staining characteristic of the mucus was identical with that of normal bronchial mucous glands. It is suggested that the benign proliferation represents a premalignant lesion. Its presence in infants shows that it may occur at an early age and reinforces the need for early removal of congenital lung cysts.\r"

Three first trimester placentas were triploid, and the remaining 29 placentas were diploid. Of the 88 cases originally diagnosed as molar pregnancies, 26 were triploid (two complete moles, 20 partial moles, and four hydropic abortions); 59 were diploid (46 complete moles, 10 partial moles, three hydropic abortions); one was tetraploid (partial mole); and two were DNA aneuploid (one partial mole, one complete mole). A significantly increased hyperdiploid fraction (a measure of cell proliferation) was detected in diploid complete moles (p less than 0.0001) and cases of persistent trophoblastic disease (p less than 0.001) when compared with diploid placentas and diploid partial moles. All seven cases of established persistent trophoblastic disease, for which follow up was available, were diploid and showed high hyperdiploid fractions within the range for diploid complete moles. These findings suggest that flow cytometric DNA measurements may be an important aid in the diagnosis of molar pregnancy. The high degree of cell proliferation found in this study may explain the premalignant potential of complete hydatidiform moles.\r"

The identity of hyaluronic acid was confirmed by a combination of electrophoretic and enzymatic techniques. The mean serum hyaluronic acid concentration for the control group was 1.09 mg/l, with a range of 0-4 mg/l. The mean concentration for patients with neoplastic disease was 10.38 mg/l, with a range of 0-100 mg/l. Sixty two per cent of the patients with disseminated neoplasm had serum hyaluronic acid concentrations above the control range. There was no correlation between the increased concentration of hyaluronic acid and tumour type, serum bilirubin, serum alkaline phosphatase, or serum urea concentrations. There was a higher incidence of hypercalcaemia in patients with increased hyaluronic acid concentrations, but the correlation between hyaluronic acid and calcium concentrations was not significant. In view of the possible role of hyaluronic acid in cellular differentiation and morphogenesis the finding of increased hyaluronic acid concentrations in patients with advanced neoplastic disease may be of fundamental importance in cancer biology.\r"

In control patients protein bound absorption decreased with age; isotope excretion was 1.0% or over in those aged under 60 and 0.5% or over in those aged 60 and above. Malabsorption of protein bound vitamin B12 with normal aqueous absorption occurred in five patients with iron deficiency, three with alcoholism, two after partial gastrectomy, two with folate deficiency and in one with a malabsorptive state. In alcoholics abstinence produced an improvement in protein bound absorption. All patients in the group for whom no cause could be found for the subnormal serum vitamin B12 concentration had normal aqueous absorption but four had malabsorption of protein bound vitamin. Although the dual isotope test gave reproducible results and was consistent with the standard Schilling test some anomalies were detected; nine patients had reduced aqueous absorption with normal protein bound absorption. Despite this the dual test may prove useful in determining the importance of a subnormal vitamin B12 concentration where the cause is not clinically apparent. Further development is needed before it can be considered for routine use.\r"

The choice of contraception should reflect the woman's feelings about induced abortion as a backup in case of contraceptive failure. If abortion is acceptable, use of any contraceptive seems reasonable. If abortion is not acceptable, depomedroxyprogesterone acetate, oral contraceptives, and intrauterine devices (each used with a condom) should provide the greatest protection against pregnancy. For most young women, the contraceptive of choice will be a low-dose oral contraceptive.\r"

These two trials were undertaken with and without ultraviolet (UV) irradiation immediately after anthralin therapy. The combined tar-anthralin therapy was significantly less of an irritant during the first 3 weeks of treatment than anthralin alone, and it did not decrease the antipsoriatic efficacy. The use of UV irradiation, either with anthralin or tar-anthralin combination, did not produce an additional therapeutic effect. These findings lead us to prefer combined tar-anthralin therapy because of its lower irritancy in comparison with anthralin alone and they show the ineffectiveness of additional UV irradiation under the conditions of this study.\r"

The dose of ultraviolet radiation received at the skin surface should be recorded to guide subsequent treatment doses as well as to monitor cumulative dose. In order to see if a single reading from an electric dosimeter accurately reflected the dose of ultraviolet radiation received at the skin surface, 212 photoresponsive dosimeter badges were affixed at various sites to the skin of one side of a female volunteer. The volunteer was then exposed to ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation in a UVA light treatment cabinet. The monitors were then removed and the received dose recorded. Portions of the body facing the lights directly received the most irradiation. Areas inclined to the plane of the lamps, shaded areas, and anatomic areas near the top and bottom of the cabinet received the least. Dosimetry as recorded by an electronic monitor in the center of the cabinet decreased when a subject stood next to it. Evidently a single measurement of dose by an electronic monitor in an empty treatment cabinet does not necessarily reflect the amount of ultraviolet radiation received at any given anatomic site by a patient undergoing phototherapy.\r"

The endogenous neuropeptide substance P is an important chemomediator of nociceptive impulses from the periphery to the central nervous system and has been demonstrated in high levels in sensory nerves supplying sites of chronic inflammation. In an attempt to alleviate the pain of 14 patients with postherpetic neuralgia, capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), known to deplete substance P, was applied topically to painful areas of skin for 4 weeks. Of the 12 patients completing this preliminary study, 9 (75%) experienced substantial relief of their pain. The only adverse reaction was an intermittent, localized burning sensation experienced by one patient with application of capsaicin. Although these results are preliminary, they suggest that topical application of capsaicin may provide a useful approach for alleviating postherpetic neuralgia and other syndromes characterized by severe localized pain.\r"

All six subjects with a history of only oyster sensitivity had minimal RAST reactivity (ratios 2 to 5) to extracts of raw or boiled oysters. Three of the seven oyster- and crustacea-sensitive subjects and six of the 12 crustacea-sensitive, oyster-tolerant or unexposed subjects had elevated RAST ratios to oyster (14 to 41). Generally, elevated oyster RAST correlated with skin prick test reactivity to oyster but not with total serum IgE levels. The oyster RAST values of the 19 crustacea-sensitive subjects (with or without oyster sensitivity) correlated with crustacea RAST reactivity (crab RAST, most significant; shrimp RAST, least significant). Rabbit antisera to crustacea extracts detected precipitating antigens present in extracts of raw or boiled oysters. Significant inhibition of the oyster RAST was obtained with oyster or crustacea extracts. These studies suggest that in the diagnosis of oyster sensitivity the RAST may not be useful and that oyster and crustacea contain common antigenic structures.\r"

In 15 atopic subjects, paired skin blister sites were simultaneously challenged with ragweed- or grass-pollen antigen or buffer for 5 hours. There were 10 times as many cells recovered at antigen (20.7 X 10(5)) than at buffer (2.0 X 10(5)) sites, p less than 0.005; greater than 97% of the cells recovered were neutrophils. The number of cells recovered at the antigen sites correlated with the total amount of histamine released (r = 0.57; p less than 0.05) but not with the extinction dilution skin test reactivity nor with the intensity of the late cutaneous allergic response measured 6 hours after the injection of antigen. Phase-contrast microscopic examination of the cells recovered from the antigen sites demonstrated that 82% to 95% were polarized compared to 0% to 1.5% of autologous blood neutrophils obtained simultaneously from the peripheral blood. Antigen site cells were as capable of serum-dependent phagocytosis as peripheral blood neutrophils. There was no significant difference in the migratory response to buffer, the chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, or leukotriene B4, but there was a significantly decreased response to platelet-activating factor when the cells recovered from antigen sites were compared to autologous blood neutrophils.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-nine percent of workers (5/17) originally studied had immunologically induced respiratory disease. Subsequent to this evaluation, increased environmental control of TMA exposure was instituted. Since that time, there have been decreasing clinical symptoms and decreasing levels of antibody against TMA conjugated to human serum albumin. These long-term studies originally used radioimmunoassays, but enzyme-linked immunoassays against TMA-conjugated proteins are now demonstrated to be equally appropriate and are more cost-effective. With appropriate clinical and immunologic studies, immunologic airway reactions to TMA may be identified and then prevented by environmental control to decrease inhalation exposure to TMA. This is likely applicable to certain other chemical antigens that immunize by inhalation.\r"

Assessment of prolonged venom treatment included analysis of immunologic parameters, efficacy of treatment, and long-term safety. Venom skin tests, venom-specific IgE antibody levels, and venom-specific IgG antibody levels comprised the immunologic parameters evaluated. A decrease in allergic sensitivity was demonstrated over time in the skin and serum. Forty-three of 57 (75%) children had less positive vespid venom skin tests, and the mean venom-specific IgE antibody level declined to less than the pretreatment value with 3 or more years of yellow jacket venom therapy. Venom-specific IgG antibody measurements rose rapidly after the initiation of venom injections and were maintained for the duration of this evaluation. During a 3- to 6-year period, 200 stings in 49 treated children resulted in only four mild systemic reactions (98% efficacy). The benign nature of interval histories, physical examinations, and laboratory analyses in these children argues optimistically for the safety of prolonged venom immunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The technique of Western blotting (immunoblotting) is being increasingly recognized as a means of identifying and characterizing allergens in complex mixtures. Because the allergens are immobilized on nitrocellulose paper, they can be probed for binding of IgE from patients' sera. In addition, the blotting technique provides useful biochemical information, such as the molecular weight of the allergen being studied. In this study we used sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to separate antigens in a crude Alternaria preparation, electrophoretically transferred these antigens to nitrocellulose, and incubated the nitrocellulose strips with individual serum and pooled sera from 13 Alternaria-sensitive subjects, sera from three nonallergic individuals, and sera from three individuals allergic to ragweed but not Alternaria. The strips were then washed, incubated with 125I-labeled antihuman IgE, washed again, and exposed to autoradiography film. We observed IgE binding to 20 allergens. Five or more sera from Alternaria-sensitive patients recognized allergens in four molecular weight regions: 55,000 to 60,000, 40,000 to 45,000, 35,000 to 40,000, and 15,000 to 20,000. With pooled sera, the most intense IgE binding was directed at allergens with molecular weights above 40,000. No IgE binding was observed with sera from individuals who were not sensitive to Alternaria. We conclude that Western blotting is an effective method for detecting allergens in complex fungal mixtures.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal, two-site radioimmunoassays (RIAs) were developed to measure allergen Der p I of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus or Der f I of D. farinae. Microtiter plates coated with monoclonal antibody (Mab) were incubated with mite extract, and bound allergen was detected with a second 125I-labeled Mab of different epitope specificity. The Mab RIAs were very sensitive (nanogram range) and highly specific. D. pteronyssinus extracts with different concentrations of Der p I demonstrated parallel binding curves, whereas a potent D. farinae extract demonstrated less than 5% of the Der p I binding in the same assay. Similar parallel curves were obtained with several D. farinae extracts in the Der f I assay, whereas D. pteronyssinus extract demonstrated little or no binding. The Mab RIAs were compared with an inhibition RIA that measured cross-reacting determinants on both Der p I and Der f I (antigen P1 equivalent [AgP1Eq]). The results demonstrated good quantitative agreement between these assays in commercial mite and house dust extracts (mean difference 1.57 +/- 0.5-fold). Thirty house dust samples with known mite counts, Der p I, and AgP1Eq content were also compared. The summed Mab RIA values for Der p I and Der f I demonstrated a very good correlation with AgP1Eq values (r = 0.86; p less than 0.001) and with assessments of total mite-allergen content by RAST inhibition (n = 21, r = 0.77; p less than 0.001). Furthermore, in samples with more than 10 mites per 100 mg of dust, the Der p I: Der f I ratio closely correlated with the ratio of the two mites counted by microscopy (n = 15, r = 0.89; p less than 0.001). The Mab RIAs can measure allergen levels in mite or dust extracts without the need for purified allergen or affinity-purified antibodies and can readily be standardized. These assays will be useful in epidemiologic studies of allergic asthma, to assess patients' exposure to mite allergens, and the effects of avoidance regimens. Because of the long-term stability and reproducibility of the reagents, Mab-based assays for specific allergens will also play an important role in the standardization of mite and other allergen extracts.\r"

These cells were demonstrated to generate highly reactive toxic species of oxygen in many pulmonary disorders; however, this was never demonstrated in asthma. The respiratory burst of bronchoalveolar lavage AM was studied in 12 subjects with asthma and in five control subjects by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (Cl). Both in subjects with asthma and in healthy subjects, the maximal value of Cl was obtained after 10 to 13 minutes of stimulation by opsonized zymozan. Baseline values and maximal Cl of AM values were significantly increased (p less than or equal to 0.03 and p less than or equal to 0.01) in subjects with asthma. There was a significant (p less than or equal to 0.01) correlation between maximal Cl of AM and the severity of asthma, assessed by a clinical score defined by Dr. K. Aas. The percentage of bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophils was significantly correlated (p less than or equal to 0.01) for all the subjects with the peak of CL of AM.

Specific IgE antibody to TCPA conjugated with human serum albumin was measured by a radioallergosorbent test and detected in all patients. After avoidance of exposure, specific IgE fell exponentially with a half-life of 1 year. Specific IgE was still detectable in 1985, and throughout the follow-up period, prick tests with the conjugate elicited immediate skin responses.

The study had a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Nedocromil sodium (1% w/v) and placebo were administered intranasally from identical metered-dose inhalers 20 minutes before allergen provocation. Three variables were measured: nasal airway resistance, the production of secretion, and the number of sneezes. Nedocromil sodium was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing nasal obstruction (p less than 0.01), rhinorrhea (p less than 0.01), and sneezing (p less than 0.05), suggesting that this drug may be useful in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.\r"

  ".W": "A study was undertaken to characterize the antibody response in rats exposed to trimellitic anhydride (TMA) by inhalation. Total antibody levels directed to trimellitic rat serum albumin (TM-RSA) from TMA-exposed rats were assayed by an ammonium sulfate technique. Total antibody levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and the matched serum were compared by correction for the albumin content of each. An ELISA was developed to detect IgG, IgA, and IgM directed toward TM-RSA in BAL and serum and to compare class-specific antibody levels in BAL and serum by normalizing for albumin content. The specificity of the rat IgG response was determined by ELISA inhibition with TM-RSA and TM-human serum albumin (TM-HSA) and compared with reciprocal inhibition studies with serum from TMA-exposed workers. The levels of total antibody in BAL were three to 15 times greater than the levels found in the matched serum pair. IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies were detected in the BAL and the serum of TMA-exposed rats but not in control rats. In each of the four rats tested, all antibody classes were present in equal or greater amounts in the BAL than in the serum. Complete inhibition of the rat IgG binding in ELISA was observed when TM-RSA or TM-HSA were added as inhibitors. Human IgG was inhibited in ELISA only by TM-HSA. In an animal model of human lung disease, the levels of total antibody as well as class-specific antibodies directed against TM-RSA were greater in BAL than in serum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 139 subjects were studied, including 63 subjects treated by grass immunotherapy and 76 untreated subjects. The sera of only four subjects were found to contain anticytochrome c IgG Ab; there was no evidence of cytochrome c-specific IgE Ab in any of these patients. Based on these data, we conclude that the prevalence of IgE and IgG Ab responses to this protein is low. Because of the small number of responders, it was not possible to demonstrate a significant association between any HLA-D specificity and immune responsiveness to ryegrass cytochrome c.\r"

Several studies have reported the nutritional status of pregnant adolescents who are considered to be at nutritional risk. This study investigated the energy, nutrient, and food intake patterns of 63 low-income pregnant women over 35 compared with 526 pregnant adolescents. Nutrient intake was assessed using a standardized 24-hour dietary recall protocol. Energy values for both groups were below recommended levels, and neither group gained the recommended amount of weight. Obesity may have been the reason for the lack of weight gain by the older pregnant women, since more than 50% of the older pregnant women were calculated to be obese prior to pregnancy. The younger women reported consuming less milk but more snack foods with lower nutrient densities, which significantly increased their energy values over those of the older group. In comparison with diets reported in other studies, the diets of the older pregnant women were more nutrient dense for most nutrients. Although all participants were enrolled in WIC, an equal number of women from both groups stated that they did not have the supplemental foods in their households at the time of interview.\r"

The indicators of energy status used were weight (adjusted for height), triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold, and energy intake. Energy status was examined by analyses of variance; the effects associated with sex, race, age, geographic region, and other potentially confounding variables were included in the model. In both surveys, there were interactions of income and food stamp use with sex. That is, poor women had greater means for weight and triceps skinfold than the nonpoor. Among the poor women, the Food Stamp Program participants weighed more than the nonparticipants, and their triceps skinfold mean was greater in NHANES II than in NHANES I. The poor men had a lower mean for triceps skinfold than the nonpoor, but there was no difference between the program participants and nonparticipants. Hence, for the poor elderly in NHANES I and II, food stamp use was not consistently associated with differences in energy status, as indicated by weight, skinfold, and energy intake.\r"

Interns also rated their perceived competence in community dietetics near the end of internships. All major and specific responsibilities from the ADA Role Delineation and Verification for Entry-Level Positions in Community Dietetics were included in the survey questionnaire. Completed questionnaires were received from 447 dietetic interns (60%), 47 internship directors (57%), and 59 Plan IV representatives (39%). Highly significant differences were found among the three groups, with Plan IV representatives' expectations highest and students' lowest. Work experience prior to internship affected mean ratings on selected responsibilities. Unlike the results of the previous studies in clinical dietetics and foodservice systems management, the ratings in community dietetics did not reach their highest until the last month of the internship. Findings from all three areas of dietetic practice suggest that students' perceived competence is considerably lower upon completion of Plan IV than after completion of an internship, indicating need for defined work experience. Different teaching techniques, i.e., lecture vs. hands-on, could be related to different ratings of perceived competence within and between practice areas.\r"

Whole milk was collected and analyzed yearly from 1975 through 1985. Yearly and overall means were similar for all elements except iron and iodine. The iron content of milk was generally low, but several samples had high levels. The distribution of iodine in whole milk was quite wide (0.002 to 0.094 mg/100 gm). The iodine content of milk is affected by the level of iodine added to cattle feed and by the use of iodophor sanitizing solutions used by the dairy industry. Overall mean levels of the elements in milligrams per 100 gm whole milk were: sodium, 42; potassium, 134; calcium, 106; phosphorus, 83; magnesium, 9.8; iron, 0.07; zinc, 0.37; copper, 0.009; manganese, 0.004; iodine, 0.034; and selenium, 0.001. Coefficients of variation were high (67% to 117%) for iron, copper, manganese, selenium, and iodine but ranged from 18% to 26% for the other elements. An 8-fl oz serving of whole milk is an excellent source of iodine, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. It also provides some sodium, magnesium, zinc, and selenium but is not a reliable source of iron, copper, or manganese.\r"

However, there is little information on the phytate:zinc and phytate X calcium:zinc millimolar ratios for total human diets. We have therefore determined the phytate:zinc and phytate X calcium:zinc millimolar ratios of self-selected diets of 29 American omnivores, 23 American vegetarians, 30 Asian Indian immigrant vegetarians, and 26 Nepalese lactating vegetarians. Criteria for selection of subjects were: good health, no extreme dietary habits, and no intake of nutrient supplements. According to the limited literature, the suggested critical values for phytate:zinc and phytate X calcium:zinc millimolar ratios in animal diets and retrospective calculations from human diets are greater than 10 and greater than 200, respectively. The mean phytate:zinc and phytate X calcium:zinc millimolar ratios of American omnivorous diets in the present study were less than 10 and 200, respectively. Confirmation of the critical molar ratios as indexes of the bioavailability of zinc in human diets has not been established by experimentation. However, if the data from animal studies are applicable to human diets, the present study suggests that phytate has little influence on zinc bioavailability of most American diets. In contrast, the mean phytate:zinc and phytate X calcium:zinc millimolar ratios of all vegetarian diets were above the proposed critical levels. Those data, therefore, suggest that phytate might increase the risk of impaired zinc bioavailability for vegetarians consuming a relatively high level of calcium.\r"

Additionally, mean serum osmolality was significantly higher among those who died (383 versus 358 mosm/L, P less than 0.0001) as was blood urea nitrogen (81.3 versus 62.3 mg/dl, P = 0.006) and sodium (148 versus 137.4 mEq/L, P less than 0.001). However, mean glucose level and anion gap were similar among patients who died and patients who survived (1068 versus 1092 mg%; 23 versus 24 mEq/L, respectively). The presence of a chronic disease or an acute comorbid illness was not associated with mortality. Diminished physiologic reserve, attendant comorbidity, or functional disability may explain the effect of age and nursing home residence. High osmolality may indicate a greater water deficit and a more advanced stage of DHS at the time of diagnosis.\r"

Vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 54%. There were eight cases of pneumonia in unvaccinated and four in vaccinated persons, three deaths in unvaccinated and one death in vaccinated persons. Complement fixation and hemagglutination inhibition tests on sera from 47 residents confirmed the diagnosis of Influenza A in the great majority of individuals, and furthermore showed very low levels of antibody for the Influenza A H1N1 and Influenza B components of the vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-nine episodes of pneumococcal bacteremia were reviewed over a 66-month period at a Veterans Administration Medical Center. Forty-one percent of these episodes were nosocomial in origin, and 59% of the patients were elderly (60 years of age or older). Nosocomial infection occurred more often in the elderly (55%) compared to those less than 60 years of age (32%; P less than 0.05). Within the elderly group, those older than 75 years of age had a higher rate of nosocomial bacteremia than those 60 to 75 years of age (76 versus 44%; P less than 0.05). The clinical presentation of the elderly and younger groups was not significantly different. All but one patient had serious underlying diseases. Eighty-three percent of the episodes were due to pneumonia, and penicillin alone was prescribed for only 21% of all cases. The mortality rate directly due to the bacteremia was 22%, while the overall mortality during the hospitalization was 47%. In the elderly, the percentage of deaths due to infection was similar to the younger group, but overall mortality during the hospitalization was significantly higher in the elderly (74 versus 26%; P less than 0.01). Physicians showed poor recognition of the significance of pneumococcal disease, as demonstrated by inclusion of the diagnosis of pneumococcal infection or bacteremia in only 27% of the discharge summaries and by predischarge vaccination of only 7% (6 of 82) of those without previous pneumococcal vaccination. In conclusion, the rate of nosocomial pneumococcal bacteremia was high in a predominantly elderly male population; it may be appropriate to consider a hospital-based vaccine program in similar populations.\r"

  ".W": "Although the basic requisites of curricula in geriatrics and gerontology have been well developed, and the need for such programs is well established, the support for development of geriatric academic programs has not been commensurate with the need. Barriers to the development of such programs include ageism, financial disincentives, scientific underdevelopment, a dearth of trained faculty, the lack of institutional support, and the declining federal role. One attempt to overcome these barriers and address the tremendous need is the development of state initiatives. In the last decade, several state legislatures have begun to provide support for geriatric education. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the initiatives of state funded university programs in geriatrics and gerontology, with particular emphasis on the California experience. A survey involving 50 states was conducted using two rounds of structured telephone interviews. The survey results found that 44 states did not have any legislatively initiated support for geriatric programs in higher education. Six states did have such programs, they included: Ohio, North Carolina, Kansas, New York, Kentucky, and California. The components of the California program are discussed in further detail. The conclusions were that although these states provide paradigms for the rest of the nation, much more still needs to be done. Several issues raised by the state programs are discussed.\r"

It is argued that advance directives can: assist the elderly person in maximizing self-determination; and help physicians in caring for the elderly and their families by removing conflict potential. Furthermore, the author compares the legal and medical understandings of patient self-determination and the uses of best interest and substituted judgment standards. It is argued that medicine and law differ on the important issues only in degree of emphasis, not in principle. To clarify the issues, a systematic classification of the multiple levels of instruction directives and agent-proxy decision-making models is developed. Finally, it is recommended that health care decision-making for the elderly can be enhanced by encouraging patients to create as much evidence as possible to affirm their preferences and values; and plan the delegation of decisions by appointing a proxy.\r"

We followed 261 patients with chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, with and without gastric ulcer, every 12 months for 9 +/- 2 years by means of endoscopic and histological examination. In the presence of dysplasia, however, studies were carried out every 6 months in moderate cases, or every 3 months in severe cases. Patients with gastric ulcer received medical therapy for 8 weeks; if healing did not occur, treatment was continued. Only subjects with healed ulcers were admitted to the follow-up. To date, 205 subjects have been included in the study. Over a 10-year period, 16 patients with recurrent gastric ulcer and 12 patients with cancer in situ or in an early stage, were subjected to surgery. One case of advanced cancer was observed. Cancer has been found in five of 95 cases of atrophic gastritis with gastric ulcer (5.2%), and in 7 of 166 cases of atrophic gastritis without gastric ulcer (4.2%). The difference was not statistically significant. Our results confirm that gastric ulcer per se is not a high-risk condition, but it must be considered as an epiphenomenon on a background of epithelial atrophy.\r"

It seems appropriate to deal separately with symptoms likely to be elicited from the upper digestive tract. Therefore, we propose \"epigastric distress syndrome\" (EDS) as a designation for chronic or recurrent epigastric pain without any anatomical antecedents and without concomitant symptoms consistent with established criteria of the irritable bowel syndrome. In this study 185 dyspeptic patients with a tentative diagnosis of EDS, based on symptoms and negative upper endoscopy, underwent laboratory screening, peroral cholecystograms, ultrasound scanning of the liver, biliary tract, and pancreas, biopsies from the distal part of the duodenum, and acid secretory tests. There were very few pathological findings. Five patients had gallstones. No single case of chronic pancreatitis or celiac disease was disclosed. Thus, EDS seems to be a \"safe\" diagnosis, and it is not unreasonable to assume that it could represent a disease entity. Although many patients had symptoms closely similar to those in duodenal ulcer, the mean basal and maximal acid output in this patient category did not differ from that observed among healthy subjects.\r"

A maximum glucose rise of 9 mg/100 ml or less indicated lactose malabsorption. Only one subject was misclassified by the milk tolerance test when compared with the lactose tolerance test (specificity 91.7%; sensitivity 100%). The test not only reproduces the worst symptoms that the subject is likely to suffer due to usual milk intake, but also accurately identifies the lactose malabsorber, thus yielding more information than the standard lactose tolerance test.\r"

Patients with IBS differed from nonpatients by reporting more severe bowel problems, more frequent doctor visits in childhood, and more pain associated with current bowel symptoms. These factors may contribute to the tendency of people with bowel symptoms to seek medical care. More patients, and in most cases nonpatients with IBS, reported poorer general health and headaches, stomachaches, and bowel complaints during childhood. They also showed evidence for greater parental attention to illness with more frequent school absences and doctor visits than normal subjects. Loss and separation during childhood, and in the current family, and conflicted or dependent maternal relationships were also more frequently reported among patients and nonpatients. These factors may contribute to the development of IBS.\r"

The magnitude of interphysician variation in testing attitudes has major implications concerning cost and risk. This is particularly applicable to the interval between follow-up colonoscopies after polypectomy and cancer surgery, and the evaluation of patients with a positive fecal occult blood test. I reviewed the recent literature most pertinent to the patients. Although I could not derive firm guidelines for most of the cases from my review, consideration of the case management decisions, in light of available information, suggests that some gastroenterologists are testing many patients more than necessary, especially with colonoscopy.\r"

Fibrin was demonstrated in the granulomas but Coxiella burnetii antigens were not. The literature on the histopathology of the liver in both acute Q fever and Q fever endocarditis shows that none of the 220 cases of Q fever endocarditis, with one possible exception, had the characteristic granulomas of acute Q fever. Rather they displayed a range from normality through nonspecific reactive hepatitis to occasional nonspecific granulomas. Thus, the characteristic granulomas of acute Q fever appear to be transient even if active infection persists. The definition of chronic Q fever should have a temporal characteristic rather than a serologic one.\r"

Maintenance drug therapy can successfully reduce the rate of recurrence and probably should be given during the first year after healing, when complications are more likely to be serious. After the first year, serious complications such as perforation, bleeding, and death are not likely. The most appropriate candidates for maintenance therapy are patients older than age 50 and those who are at high risk for relapse (e.g., those who smoke, have a family history of ulcer disease, or a history of ulcer relapse). The currently available cytoprotective agent sucralfate may be the most appropriate agent to use for maintenance therapy because it is locally acting and low in toxicity, as well as effective.\r"

Because placentation in the pig is noninvasive, these suppressor cells are not associated with decidua. Cells with similar activity are also found between the implantation sites and in the uterus of pseudopregnant pigs, suggesting that fetal trophoblast is not essential for recruitment of intrauterine suppressor cells. Cell separation studies demonstrate that two independent populations of suppressor cells are present in the pig uterus on day 28 of gestation, as well as a population of PHA-responsive cells. The inability of unseparated porcine uterine cells to respond to PHA, plus the reconstitution of suppression in remixing experiments, demonstrate directly that a functional, putative T effector cell population is blocked within the uterus during normal mammalian pregnancy.\r"

This determinant is progressively lost during differentiation, and the more committed progenitors which grow in the presence of CSF-1 alone are essentially devoid of Qa-m7. Significant increases in both the proportion of Qa-m7-positive myeloid cells and the level of Qa-m7 antigen expression have been observed in bone marrow cells regenerating after the administration of the cytotoxic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). By exploiting this increase in Qa-m7 antigen expression during regeneration and the HPP-CFC-sparing properties of 5-FU, we have been able to enrich HPP-CFC from marrows 8 days post-5-FU treatment (FU8d) to purities of greater than 20%. Furthermore, discontinuous gradient centrifugation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting of FU8d bone marrow cells on the basis of their light-scattering properties and Qa-m7 expression has unmasked a further subset of HPP-CFC which strictly requires the combined stimulus of three hemopoietic growth factors (H-1, IL 3, and CSF-1) for clonal growth. These highly enriched subsets of HPP-CFC are either identical to or co-fractionate with transplantable multipotential hemopoietic progenitors capable of reconstituting the hemopoietic system of lethally irradiated mice. Up to one in three cells in these highly enriched fractions is an HPP-CFC, and up to one in two cells may be CFU-S assayed 13 days post-transplantation. In addition, these fractions contain progenitors capable of reconstituting the platelet, erythroid, and myeloid compartments of the marrow.\r"

The six monoclonal antibodies markedly differ in their ability to induce anti-idiotypic antibodies, because the latter were not detected in the sera from the mice immunized with the MoAb AB7ae9 and with the MoAb AC6G. The MoAb AC1.59 and CR11-462 elicited antibodies to private idiotypes, and the MoAb Q5/6 and Q5/13 elicited antibodies to private and public idiotypes. The titer of the latter in the anti-MoAb Q5/6 antiserum appears to be markedly lower than that of the former ones; no marked difference was detected in the titer of the two types of antibodies in the anti-MoAb Q5/13 antiserum. Blocking experiments with a panel of monoclonal antibodies showed that the MoAb Q5/13 shares idiotypes with the anti-HLA Class I MoAb Q5/6, 127, and 441 and with the anti-HLA Class I MoAb CR11-351, Q1/28, Q6/64, and 6/31, but does not share idiotypes with any of the nine anti-human melanoma-associated antigen MoAb tested. The spectrotypes of the anti-MoAb CR11-462 and anti-MoAb Q5/13 antisera comprise two major components in the pH 6.2 to 6.7 range, that of the anti-MoAb Q5/6 antiserum comprises two major components in the pH 6.5 to 6.8 range, and that of the anti-MoAb AC1.59 antiserum comprises a number of components in the pH 5.6 to 7.2 range.\r"

If this reaction occurs in the circulation, the fate of the resulting immune complex may depend upon many factors including the ability of the immune complex to fix complement and bind to complement receptors on circulating cells (immune adherence). We studied the in vivo formation and immune adherence of soluble antibody/dsDNA immune complexes in the circulation of both a nonprimate and a primate model. The fact that this sequence of biological recognition reactions is completed in less than 2 min suggests that the immune adherence phenomenon may play a crucial role in the clearance of nascent complement-fixing immune complexes from the circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotrienes (LT), mainly LTB4, have been shown recently to affect several functions of human lymphocytes in vitro, and they are regarded as putative modulators of the immune response. Although it is recognized that human neutrophils, eosinophils, monocyte-macrophages, and mast cells can generate LTs, the synthesis of 5-lipoxygenase products by lymphocytes is still the subject of a controversy. Human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes, nylon wool-purified lymphocytes, CD4+, CD4- T cells, large granular lymphocytes, and various fractions of pure lymphocyte preparations obtained by counter flow centrifugal elutriation were stimulated for 10 min to 24 hr with ionophore A23187, phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or lipopolysaccharide with or without exogenous arachidonic acid (AA); supernatants were analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with radioimmunoassay (RIA) methods for the presence of LTB4. Pure human lymphocyte preparations, which were shown to be free of monocytes, did not release any detectable amount of LTB4. Increasing percentage of contaminating monocytes was clearly paralleled by increasing amounts of LTB4. Murine thymocytes, interleukin 2-dependent CTLL2 cytotoxic lymphocytes, EL4 thymoma cells, and human Jurkatt cells were also found to be unable to generate detectable amounts of LTB4 after stimulation with ionophore A23187, phytohemagglutinin, phorbol myristate acetate, recombinant interleukin 1, or interleukin 2 with or without exogenous AA. The addition of increasing numbers of adherence-purified monocytes to Jurkatt cells was followed by increased synthesis of LTB4. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the synthesis of LTB4 by pure human lymphocyte preparations or some human and animal lymphoid cell lines is not detectable by combined HPLC-RIA methods in any of the conditions used.\r"

To determine whether these \"breakthroughs\" might be due to the absence of specific antibodies, we tested sera from vaccinees before or at the time of exposure to varicella for antibodies to the three major glycoproteins of varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Protection could not be correlated with the presence or level of any of these antibodies. Levels of antibodies to glycoproteins before onset of zoster were similar to those in sera of individuals who had had varicella previously and did not develop varicella after household exposure. Thus, protection against infections with VZV cannot be explained by the presence of specific antibodies to glycoproteins.\r"

Neurovirulence of the Oita-1 strain to mice was, however, stronger than that of the Oita-2 strain. Synthesis of the M protein by the Oita-2 strain was not demonstrable in the infected cells when they were labeled for 24 hr; however, a new protein moiety that was smaller in molecular weight than the M protein and that was not precipitated with monoclonal antibody to M protein was demonstrated by pulse-labeling for 1 hr.

In three experiments the infection rate of restrained recipients (10 [56%] of 18), who could not touch their faces and could only have been infected by aerosols, and that of unrestrained recipients (12[67%] of 18), who could have been infected by aerosol, by direct contact, or by indirect fomite contact, was not significantly different (chi 2 = 0.468, P = .494). In a fourth experiment, transmission via fomites heavily used for 12 hr by eight donors was the only possible route of spread, and no transmissions occurred among 12 recipients (P less than .001 by two-tailed Fisher's exact test). These results suggest that contrary to current opinion, rhinovirus transmission, at least in adults, occurs chiefly by the aerosol route.\r"

The patients were compared for age, preoperative estradiol concentration, luteal-phase support, and number of follicles aspirated and were found to be similar but were not matched for cause of infertility. The lap OPU group had more oocytes recovered per follicle aspirated (P less than 0.001), but because of a lower fertilization rate (P less than 0.01), the number of embryos transferred was similar. Nevertheless, more (P less than 0.05) pregnancies occurred in the TV OPU group. Patients were subgrouped so that comparisons of patients with the same cause of infertility, tubal disease alone, were considered. This showed that the pregnancy rate was still higher in the TV OPU group (P less than 0.05). TV OPU was less painful and not associated with increased morbidity, and since the data suggest that TV OPU was at least as successful as lap OPU, it is recommended that all oocyte pickups in the future be performed transvaginally.\r"

Seven hundred twenty-eight single-cell embryos were cultured in TYH-280 medium supplemented with 8 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and a 20% concentration of Fraction A, B, C, D, or E, whole HCS, or BSA alone. Embryos cultured with Fraction A or E or whole HCS demonstrated a significantly reduced growth rate (P less than 0.01), while embryos cultured with Fraction D demonstrated a significantly increased growth rate (P less than 0.01). Additionally, 649 single-cell embryos were cultured in medium which was supplemented with 8 mg BSA/ml and a 0, 1, 2, or 5% concentration of Fraction A or E. Fraction E displayed toxicity even at a 1% concentration (P less than 0.01), while Fraction A demonstrated growth inhibition at a 5% concentration (P less than 0.05) but increased the hatching rate at a 1% concentration (P less than 0.01). Finally, 635 single-cell embryos were cultured with four distinct fractions of HCS obtained from a Sephacryl S-200 column: Fractions I, MW 100,000; II, MW 70,000-100,000; III, MW 30,000-70,000; and IV, low molecular weight (less than 5,000).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The addition of groups of 4 or 20 amino acids to TALP + glutamine medium produced differential effects, some groups inhibiting development while others stimulated it. The beneficial effect of glutamine was on the eight-cell to morula transition as well as on blastocyst formation, while the effects of the other 20 amino acids studied were only on blastocyst development. This study represents further progress made in identifying the culture requirements for growth of hamster preimplantation embryos in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Follicular fluid (FF) levels of prolactin (PRL), estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), and androstenedione (delta 4A) were related to diversities in oocyte maturation, fertilization, and cleavage among oocytes obtained for in vitro fertilization. Follicles with mature stage I oocytes contained similar concentrations of PRL and E2, more P, and less delta 4A compared to follicles containing immature oocytes. Follicles with mature stage II oocytes had higher amounts of P and E2 but similar levels of PRL and delta 4A compared to follicles with mature stage I oocytes. Prolactin was lower and E2 higher in FF associated with fertilizable oocytes than in those with unfertilized gametes. Follicles which yielded gametes that ultimately divided to more than four cells had the highest E2 levels, while the lowest E2 concentrations were associated with fertilized, uncleaved eggs. P, delta 4A, and PRL levels in FF were not related to oocyte cleavage. We conclude that human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) treatment does not necessarily lead to a synchrony or uniformity of preovulatory follicles, maturation of oocytes is associated with rising levels of progesterone and decreasing levels of delta 4A in FF, an increased cleavage rate in vitro is associated with higher FF levels of E2, and high levels of PRL in FF are associated with unfertilized oocytes. These findings emphasize that differences in the hormonal milieu surrounding oocytes may have profound effects on the success of in vitro fertilization.\r"

In the 15 women with secretory endometrium there were 11 pregnancies (3 preclinical, 6 abortions, and 2 term). This study demonstrates that endometrial biopsy at the time of embryo transfer does not exclude viable pregnancy. The presence of a proven secretory endometrium may also be an important factor in determining the successful outcome of IVF.\r"

But they were less than or equal to 50% for four of nine infertile couples (group 2) with cytotoxic sperm antibodies in both partners (n = 6) or the husband alone (n = 3). Two women in group 1 were successful in achieving normal, full-term pregnancies with the delivery of normal infants (chi2 = 4.2, P less than 0.05, by chi-square analysis). One of them consistently tested negative for sperm antibodies, while her husband was previously treated with antibiotics for infection and transient sperm antibodies in the seminal plasma. Subsequently, antibody titers in the husband were in the normal range when the successful IVF-ET was performed. One woman in group 2, with antibodies to her autoimmune husband's sperm but not control sperm and with a long-standing poor postcoital test sperm motility, conceived through artificial insemination with donor sperm (AID) after failing to conceive with her husband through IVF-ET. These data suggest that the presence of cytotoxic sperm antibodies in the serum and/or secretions of both partners reduces the rates of fertilization of mature oocytes in spite of using fetal cord serum in the IVF media. Pregnancy achievement is impaired in this group.\r"

In this study the concentrations of AP were determined in follicular fluids collected from follicles of 52 women at the time of laparoscopy performed in connection with an in vitro fertilization program. In each of the 52 women at least one ovum was harvested. Of the 52 ova, 28 cleaved in vitro, while in 24 ova cleavage was not seen. Levels of AP in follicular fluids of women whose ova did not cleave were significantly lower than those found in follicular fluids of women with at least one ovum undergoing cleavage: 0.45 +/- 0.14 (SE) and 4.78 +/- 0.37 Bess Lowry Units (BLU), respectively. Comparison of AP levels in follicular fluids of women who conceived (5) and women whose ova cleaved, but in whom pregnancy was not achieved (23), did not reveal significant differences: 5.87 +/- 1.29 and 4.55 +/- 0.35 BLU, respectively. Moreover, the enzyme level was typical for a woman and not for a follicle. Fluids of two different follicles of the same woman, when one ovum cleaved and one did not, showed similar AP levels. AP levels were high in all samples follicles of women in whom at least one ovum cleaved. These findings indicate that the presence of certain levels of acid phosphatase represents an important, albeit not the sole, condition for ovum maturation. Moreover, the follicular fluid levels of AP could serve as an indicator of proper timing of the follicular puncture in relation to the human chorionic gonadotropin injection (or the luteinizing hormone peak).\r"

The alterations in fecal nitrogen excretion were additionally correlated with changes in total body urea synthesis and degradation rates. Six patients with stable cirrhosis received a control diet alone followed by the administration of lactulose (56 +/- 6 gm/day), and eight similar patients received lactulose alone (63 +/- 5 gm/day) followed by the addition of neomycin (4 gm/day). Their feces were partitioned into individual fractions by physical separation. Lactulose administration increased nitrogen excreted in the bacterial fraction by 165% (from 0.52 +/- 0.14 gm/day to 1.38 +/- 0.21 gm/day) and by 135% in the soluble fraction (from 0.58 +/- 0.08 gm/day to 1.36 +/- 0.23 gm/day). When lactulose was supplemented with neomycin, the nitrogen content of the bacterial fraction decreased by 28%. Lactulose caused a 23% reduction in the urea production rate that was mainly accounted for by increase in fecal nitrogen excretion. The addition of neomycin caused a further reduction in urea production that was explained by an inhibition of urea degradation. These results demonstrate that a major effect of lactulose was to augment the incorporation of nitrogen into fecal bacteria although nitrogen in the soluble fraction also increased. The additional nitrogen excreted in the fecal bacterial and soluble fractions caused a reduction in urea synthesis.\r"

In this study, adenosine receptors were demonstrated on normal rabbit alveolar macrophages by examining specific binding of tritiated 5-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA) to intact cells. Scatchard analysis suggested a single class of approximately 33,000 binding sites per cell and an estimated Kd of 0.46 mumol/L. Competitive inhibition of tritiated NECA binding was demonstrated for 2-chloroadenosine (2-CA; Ki = 3.68 mumol/L) and L-phenylisopropyl adenosine (L-PIA; Ki greater than 100 mumol/L), a rank order of binding affinities indicative of an A2 receptor. Theophylline and isobutyl methylxanthine had Kis of 368 and 27.6 mumol/L, respectively. For functional correlation, NECA was found to be 10-fold more potent than L-PIA in stimulating an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. In addition, macrophages were cultured for 24 hours with NECA, 2-CA, or L-PIA to determine whether these analogues modulated expression of either cell-associated procoagulant activity or elaboration of plasminogen activator. Procoagulant activity was suppressed by as much as 62% (P less than 0.05); the rank order of potency and blockade of the effect with theophylline suggest that suppression of procoagulant activity occurred primarily by stimulation of A2 receptors. By contrast, these analogues stimulated production and release of plasminogen activator by 30% (P less than 0.05), but this effect had none of the features of an A2-mediated mechanism. Macrophages were cotreated with nitrobenzylthioinosine (10 mumol/L) and adenosine deaminase (2 U/ml) to allow adenosine accumulation exclusively within the cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A pathogenic role of growth hormone in the tissue complications of diabetes has been postulated. Because collagen has been found to accumulate in myocardial interstitium in diabetes, we have undertaken a study of the relationship of plasma growth hormone levels to collagen accumulation in a canine model of chronic diabetes. Sedentary normal animals and diabetic animals were compared respectively with physically conditioned animals in which the collagen increment associated with diabetes was minimized. Basal growth hormone levels as well as increments induced by hormone release after clonidine have been related to the myocardial alteration. Myocardial collagen concentration was increased to 2.94 +/- 0.11 micrograms/mg dry weight in the sedentary diabetic animals vs. 1.97 +/- 0.07 micrograms/mg dry weight in sedentary normals (P less than 0.01), but was normal in the exercised diabetic animals after 1 year. However, levels of growth hormone in the basal state were similar in all four groups. After provocative stimulation with clonidine in the normals there was a progressive rise of growth hormone levels that was similar in the sedentary and physically conditioned animals. The diabetic groups exhibited a rise of plasma growth hormone that was not significantly higher in the nonexercised animals. Moreover the peak levels of growth hormone after clonidine were comparable. The data suggest that collagen accumulation in diabetic myocardium does not appear to be dependent on increased plasma levels of growth hormone, but a role for enhanced sensitivity to hormonal action is not excluded.\r"

The amounts of endotoxin in the pulmonary lavage fluid, and in arterial and venous blood were determined. Forty minutes after the start of exposure to 400 micrograms/m3 of Escherichia coli 026:B6-LPS, 7.7 +/- 2.9 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could be demonstrated in the pulmonary lavage fluid, and 60 minutes afterwards, the amount was 4.9 +/- 1.4 ng/ml. In the arterial blood, the amounts at 10 and 40 minutes of exposure, and 60 minutes afterwards were 21.2 +/- 23.8 pg/ml, 29.2 +/- 31.8 pg/ml, and 1.1 +/- 1.0 pg/ml, respectively. There was no significant difference of LPS content in the arterial and venous blood. The results demonstrate that the lung is a potent barrier for penetration of endotoxins into the body. The experimental model enables studies of how other exposures such as mineral dusts, tobacco smoke, or viral or bacterial infections might affect this defense.\r"

  ".W": "Several proteins have been described that can modulate the activity of the complement component C5a, a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils. One of these inhibitors has been termed chemotactic factor inactivator (CFI). We hypothesized that CFI was antigenically present in normal human serum and that antigenic levels would correlate with the ability of serum to inhibit C5a. To test this hypothesis, CFI was purified from normal human serum, antibodies to CFI were developed in rabbits, and these reagents were used to develop an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay to measure CFI. Sera from 32 normal volunteers were assayed for CFI and found to contain 77 +/- 29 micrograms/ml (range 17 to 137 micrograms/ml). Partially purified CFI from normal human sera was found to inhibit 61% +/- 9% (range 45% to 75%) of the ability of C5a to attract human neutrophils. Importantly, the ability of CFI to inhibit C5a-induced neutrophil chemotaxis correlated with the antigenic amounts of CFI (r = 0.68, P less than 0.05), suggesting that CFI is a major inhibitor of C5a. This was confirmed by the finding that (1) all C5a inhibitory activity coprecipitated with CFI by ammonium sulfate precipitation (45% to 65% saturation), and (2) depletion of this ammonium sulfate fraction of CFI resulted in a major loss in its ability to inhibit the chemotactic activity of C5a (57% vs. 8% inhibition, P less than 0.01). To determine whether CFI could play a role in the modulation of inflammation at tissue sites, normal bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was evaluated for the presence of CFI. CFI was identified in all fluids (mean 0.50 +/- 0.09 micrograms/mg albumin, range 0.14 to 1.43 micrograms/mg albumin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Immunoglobulin G red cell autoantibodies obtained from IgG antiglobulin-positive normal blood donors were labeled with radioactive iodine and compared with alloanti-D with respect to their properties and binding behavior. Iodine 125-labeled IgG autoantibody migrated as a single homogeneous peak with the same relative mobility as human IgG on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The isoelectric focusing pattern of labeled autoantibodies varied from donor to donor but was similar to that of alloanti-D, consisting of multiple IgG populations with isoelectric points in the neutral to alkaline range. 125I-autoantibody bound to all human red cells of common Rh phenotypes. Evidence for immunospecific antibody binding of the labeled autoantibody was based on variation in equilibrium binding to nonhuman and human red cells of common and rare phenotypes, enhanced binding after red cell protease modification, antiglobulin reactivity of cell-bound IgG comparable to that of cell-bound anti-D, and saturation binding in autoantibody excess. Scatchard analysis of two 125I-autoantibody preparations yielded site numbers of 41,500 and 53,300 with equilibrium constants of 3.7 and 2.1 X 10(8) L X mol-1. Dog, rabbit, rhesus monkey, and baboon red cells were antigen(s) negative by quantitative adsorption studies adsorbing less than 3% of the labeled autoantibody. Reduced ability of rare human D--red blood cells to adsorb the autoantibody and identification of donor autoantibodies that bind to Rh null red blood cells indicated that eluates contained multiple antibody populations of complex specificities in contrast to anti-D, which consists of a monospecific antibody population. Another difference is that less than 70% of the autoantibody IgG was adsorbed by maximum binding red blood cells as compared with greater than 85% for alloanti-D. Evidence obtained indicates that the red blood cell nonadsorbable IgG, some 30%, consists of other IgG populations, one of which represents IgG autoanti-idiotypes to the autoantibody.\r"

This protein is composed of 73 amino acid residues arranged in a single polypeptide chain with homogeneous amino and carboxyl terminals. Sequence homology with protein AA from other species is quite high with near identity for residues 31 through 54. This sequence is identical to the partial structures for CBA/J mouse AA and serum amyloid A (SAA) previously reported. It is also an exact match to a predicted 73-residue segment from one form of mouse SAA complementary DNA.\r"

Homogenates were incubated with various substrates, namely, tritiated acetate (5.3 mumol/L) or tritiated acetyl-coenzyme A (2 mumol/L) or tritiated lyso-PAF (30 nmol/L) at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes in RPMI medium 1640 and were subsequently stimulated with the phospholipase agonist A23187 (9.5 mumol/L) for various time periods. Alkyl-ether lipids were analyzed by thin-layer and high-pressure liquid chromatography and identified by enzymatic and chemical treatment. To assess PAF degradation, glomerular homogenates were incubated with 3H-PAF standard (1 nmol/L) for various time periods. In response to prolonged stimulation (120 minutes) with A23187, glomerular tissue synthesized PAF primarily via an acetyl transferase, utilizing either 3H-lyso-PAF or 3H-acetate/3H-acetyl-coenzyme A. 3H-PAF was rapidly degraded mainly to 3H-lyso-PAF, and this step was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The apparent Km and Vmax values of enzymatic degradation were 16.6 mumol and 100 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The presence of PAF biosynthetic and degradative pathways may be of importance in regulating the function of the normal glomerulus and in glomerular inflammatory injury.\r"

Exposure to 20 micrograms/ml iron provided as 59Fe-ferric ammonium citrate in serum-free Ham F-10 culture medium resulted in the accumulation of 39% of the iron within 24 hours and a 10- to 12-fold increase in cellular MDA. Hypoxia (1% oxygen) resulted in a more than twofold increase in iron uptake but only minor changes in cellular MDA concentrations. Ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol (1 mg/ml) had opposing effects on iron uptake and MDA production. Ascorbic acid reduced 24-hour iron uptake by 73% (P less than 0.001) whereas alpha-tocopherol increased iron uptake by 19% (P less than 0.025). In contrast, cellular MDA after iron loading increased by 86% with the addition of ascorbate, and was reduced by 75% with alpha-tocopherol (P less than 0.001). The ratio of increase in cellular MDA relative to percent iron uptake (lipid peroxidation ratio) was 7.29 with iron loading plus ascorbate vs. 0.13 with iron loading plus alpha-tocopherol, a 56-fold difference between the two extremes. In vitro deferoxamine treatment for 3 hours resulted in a 53% reduction in the radioactive iron content of iron-loaded heart cells and a 40% reduction in MDA. Simultaneous deferoxamine and ascorbate or alpha-tocopherol treatment did not affect iron mobilization, but had a profound effect on MDA concentrations. Ascorbic acid prevented entirely the beneficial effect of deferoxamine on MDA concentrations in iron-loaded cells, whereas alpha-tocopherol potentiated the effect of deferoxamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Among several predictor variables, including lean body mass measured by DPA, weight, and height, only normalization for the projected skeletal area (i.e., calculation of the total body bone density) had an appreciable effect on reduction of TBBM variation. In regression analysis of TBBM, raw and normalized, vs. age, a menopause-adjusted age was used for interpretation of data in women. Regardless of the normalization procedure, the best fit of TBBM vs. menopause-adjusted age was obtained by a polynomial regression of the third degree or a combined linear (premenopausal)--exponential (postmenopausal) regression. In men bone loss was linear with age (0.2% to 0.3% per year). In women, no significant premenopausal bone loss was found. The postmenopausal exponential loss was 4%, 0.44%, and 0.03% per year from TBBM 1 year, 10 years, and 20 years after the menopause. This amounts to a negative calcium balance of 100 mg calcium per day during the first postmenopausal year, and returning to zero after 20 years of menopause, when about 20% of premenopausal bone is lost.\r"

The proportion of patients considered depressed using each of the measures ranged from 21 percent to 38 percent. The patient-reported measures were more closely correlated with each other than with the physician-reported measures. The finding that depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in this population supports the need for training physicians in recognition, treatment, and documentation of depression. Future research imperatives should include differentiating between depressive symptoms and diagnoses, investigating the use of interviewer-administered measures of depression as screening tools, and investigating the relationships between depression, physiologic disease, and use of health services.\r"

American blacks of similar socioeconomic status have rates that are almost double that of whites. Part of this discrepancy can be explained by lifestyles, maternal behavior, lack of access to health care, and poor nutrition. The study reported here compared the most potent predictor of infant mortality--low birthweight--among low-income black and Mexican-American infants born at Cook County Hospital. The incidence of low birthweight was 16.6 percent for blacks and 5.9 percent for Mexican-Americans, suggesting that the latter group enjoys some sociocultural protection from the effects of urban poverty in the United States. Further efforts to reduce the infant mortality rate in the inner city should be directed at preserving those sociocultural traits that improve pregnancy outcomes and changing those social and economic factors that cause and promote unhealthy maternal behavior.\r"

A questionnaire was administered to 1,564 students aged between 13 and 18 years in six high schools. Mean participant age was 15.3 years; 801 were male and 763 were female. Questions were drawn from both physical and psychosocial aspects of teenage life. The teenagers answered as to whether they would like to discuss the suggested topics on visits to physicians, and whether in fact such a discussion had taken place. The three topics of most interest to teenagers were physical fitness, nutrition, and growth. Teenagers wanted to discuss these topics in over 80 percent of the visits, and they indicated that actual discussion took place in just under 50 percent of the visits. Discussion of sexually transmitted disease was desired by teenagers 70 percent of the time, with a discussion rate of only 18 percent; contraception at 66 percent with a physician discussion rate of only 22 percent. If physicians discuss exercise, nutrition, and growth with teenage patients, in over 80 percent of cases they will be providing the patient with valued information. This initial dialogue will establish a base of communication that may allow for the discussion of issues teenagers often find more difficult (such as contraception, sexually transmitted disease, depression, drugs, and drinking).\r"

At the same time, however, concerns regarding premature declaration of death, feelings of the potential donor's family, and cost or benefit of organ donation were identified as well. Nearly one half the residents thought they had little knowledge about organ donation or transplant. Residents' feelings about donating their own organs were most predictive of their opinion of organ donation in general. Only 25 percent of residents had signed an organ donor card and had it witnessed.

  ".W": "Successful treatment of pain syndromes is one of the most common and most difficult problems facing family physicians. Frequently analgesics provide inadequate treatment, and clinicians are forced to consider alternatives. This article reviews the neurophysiologic similarities between depression and the chronic pain syndromes and describes several well-designed double-blinded studies that give evidence for the efficacy of antidepressants in chronic pain syndromes. These studies conclude that antidepressants should be considered in chronic pain syndromes that do not respond to analgesics. For chronic pain, antidepressants should be started at a low dosage and increased in a stepwise manner until an improvement in the pain occurs or intolerable side effects intervene. Side effects are a bothersome aspect of antidepressant therapy but are more tolerable at the doses generally needed for pain relief than at antidepressive doses. At least three weeks of antidepressant therapy is generally needed to gain significant relief of symptoms.\r"

There is no discussion in the literature of humeral factors related to localized fibrous mesotheliomas, but the fever, chills, and rheumatoid complaints in some patients may suggest such factors. The presence of the tumor in the already hypercoagulable state of pregnancy may have predisposed this patient to pulmonary emboli. Anticoagulation led to hemorrhage from the thin-walled vascular areas of the tumor. This acute bleeding produced the hypovolemic shock on the third postpartum day, with a cascade of events leading to adult respiratory distress syndrome and the patient's ultimate death. This case underscores the importance of broad differential diagnosis as a continuing challenge in the practice of medicine.\r"

  ".U": "87282217\r", 
  ".W": "Forensic psychiatrists should be aware of the many ways that paranoid individuals may present within the legal system. Litigious paranoids often utilize the legal system as a vehicle to act out their fantasies and delusional preoccupations. Imaginary grievances, accusations based on delusional ideation, and irrational vindictiveness toward imagined persecutors may find full expression in any number of legal contexts. They can defeat the rational and legitimate objectives of the legal system, enmesh innocent and unsuspecting victims in nightmarish legal entanglements, and subvert the process of justice. The forensic psychiatrist can assist the court by alerting it to the presence of paranoid illness in parties or witnesses and by clarifying what the effects of such psychopathology are and what the most favorable response should be. Three legal contexts wherein paranoid individuals may present within the legal system are discussed: the \"hypercompetent\" defendant, the paranoid party in a divorce proceeding, and the paranoid complaining witness. Case illustrations are presented for each legal context. Two issues are discussed: the dividing line between paranoid ideation (and its impact on the legal process) and so-called \"normal\" thinking (and its objective to use the legal process to obtain certain ends); and the degree to which psychiatric opinions in this area should influence the way an individual's case is handled by the legal system. The author concludes that, despite the costs involved, it is preferable that even paranoids have their \"day in court.\"\r"

Controlled laboratory studies revealed that the BCIP swab procedure was as sensitive as the semiquantitative SAP test currently employed in the FBI Laboratory for the presumptive screening of semen stains. A validation study of the BCIP swab procedure in parallel with the current procedure using 4305 case evidence stains indicated that the BCIP swab procedure was as effective as the current procedure in identifying those questioned stains which lack semen. The advantage of the BCIP swab procedure is that it can be performed on questioned stains in situ and thereby avoids the requirement of removing and extracting the stain before assay of SAP activity.\r"
