The apparent cause of pancreatitis was increased pressure on the pancreatic duct due to infrequent voiding and a large bladder. A frequent voiding program partially relieved the pancreatitis, but final resolution necessitated conversion of the pancreaticoduodeno-cystostomy to a Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy at 6 months posttransplant. Both renal and pancreatic function are stable after 1 year, with no recurrence of pancreatitis since urinary undiversion. We believe pressure pancreatitis or urine reflux pancreatitis to be an infrequently reported cause of graft dysfunction in bladder-drained pancreas transplant recipients.\r"

However, because potential pathology both locally (graft pancreatitis, endothelial damage of preservation and operative trauma, diminished graft blood flow) as well as systemically (atherosclerosis, hypertension) is present in SPK patients, we consider them at high risk for thromboembolic complications and therefore support prophylaxis of post-SPK thrombocytosis with platelet inhibitors.\r"

Hospitals are under economic pressures to develop methods to control the excessive use of these drugs. We expanded the capabilities of our hospital information system to monitor the duration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. For six months during one year we used the computer system to monitor antibiotics received by every surgical patient and to identify patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis longer than was deemed necessary according to generally accepted guidelines. For six months in the following year we used the system to monitor and identify the same types of patients and clinical pharmacists placed antibiotic \"stop orders\" in the charts of the patients identified by the computer. Surgical patients received an average of 19 doses of antibiotics in the first year compared with 13 doses in the second year (p less than 0.001). The average cost of antibiotics received more than 48 hours after the operation was $42 less per patient in year 2 than in year 1, resulting in a potential cost savings of $44,562 in six months. The computer system was found to be an efficient tool for monitoring all antibiotics given to surgical patients and identifying patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis longer than necessary. Clinical use of this system appears to have resulted in improved usage of antibiotic prophylaxis.\r"

Previous reports suggest that saliva ethanol concentrations measured by a colorimetric saliva dipstick assay correlate well with serum ethanol concentrations and could be useful in the emergency department. We compared saliva dipstick assay results with concurrent serum ethanol measurements in 67 emergency department patients with altered mental status. Color changes of the stick are calibrated to reflect serum ethanol concentrations of negative (no color change), 4.3 mmol/L, 10.8 mmol/L, 21.7 mmol/L, and greater than or equal to 65.1 mmol/L. Emergency department staff were instructed to conduct the measurement according to the manufacturer's directions and round up equivocal results to the next highest concentration. Serum ethanol concentrations (mean +/- SD) grouped by dipstick results were: negative, 5.2 +/- 13.1 mmol/L; 4.3 mmol/L, 29.1 +/- 18.0 mmol/L; 10.8 mmol/L, 46.6 +/- 27.6 mmol/L; 21.7 mmol/L, 47.0 +/- 18.5 mmol/L; and 65.1 mmol/L, 62.4 +/- 24.2 mmol/L. There were 12 false-negative and 2 false-positive results. Correlation between dipstick results and serum ethanol concentrations was rho = 0.611 (p less than 0.0005). The lack of accuracy of the saliva dipstick measurements and the high number of false-negative results make it a poor choice for determining alcohol use in the emergency department patient.\r"

The reaction persisted for five weeks, probably because of inability to rapidly eliminate vancomycin secondary to underlying renal failure. Maculopapular rashes have been reported in two to six percent of patients who receive this drug, with severe skin reactions rarely reported. In addition to this case report, a review of the literature including 11 Eli Lilly/Food and Drug Administration case reports is presented.

(3) Research articles of programs to improve prescribing identify types of programs that have been found to be successful. (4) Theories of human inference describe how judgments are formulated and identify errors in judgment that can play a role in prescribing. This review is presented in two parts.

LV ejection fraction was assessed by using Simpson's biplane rule. The 34 patients with normal ejection fraction (greater than or equal to 0.51) (group A) generally had the highest values of peak (31 +/- 13 mm Hg) and mean (16 +/- 6 mm Hg) gradients, whereas 19 patients with moderate to severe reduction of ejection fraction (less than or equal to 0.31) (group C) had the lowest values (17 +/- 6 and 9 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively) (p less than 0.05). Significant decreases (p less than 0.05) for acceleration and corrected (for heart rate) velocity time integral in group C were noted compared to group A, and group B (21 patients with mild to moderately reduced ejection fraction [0.50 to 0.32]). A significant inverse correlation for Doppler-derived peak and mean gradients and corrected velocity time integral was demonstrated with increasing aortic valve prosthetic sizes from 19 to 29 mm in group A patients (r = -0.41 to -0.71) but less so in group B or C. Thus, in addition to valve size, LV function should be considered an important factor in detecting prosthetic valvular flow characteristics and dysfunction. A normal derived velocity and gradient in patients with moderately to severely depressed LV function may not rule out significant valvular stenosis.\r"

Exercise training intensity was moderate (65 to 75% of peak treadmill heart rate). During the 8-week study period VO2 max increased significantly in both groups from 33.3 +/- 3.2 to 37.9 +/- 3.5 ml/kg/min in men performing long exercise bouts and from 32.1 +/- 4.6 to 34.5 +/- 4.5 ml/kg/min in men performing short exercise bouts (p less than 0.05 within and between groups). Adherence to unsupervised exercise training performed at home and at work by men in long and short bouts was high; total duration of training completed was 96 and 93% of the prescribed amount and total number of sessions completed was 92 and 93% of that prescribed, respectively. In both groups exercise heart rate measured by a portable microprocessor was within or above the prescribed range for greater than 85% of the prescribed duration. Thus, multiple short bouts of moderate-intensity exercise training significantly increase peak oxygen uptake. For many individuals short bouts of exercise training may fit better into a busy schedule than a single long bout.\r"

Recordings were made for 1 hour before sleep, during sleep and for 1 hour after awakening in all subjects at 760 torr (sea level), in 7 subjects at 390 torr (5,490 m), in 6 at 347 torr (6,100 m) and in 4 at 282 torr (7,620 m). The following results were obtained: periods of sinus bradycardia occurred during sleep in all subjects at 3 altitudes with a mean heart rate of 41 +/- 0.5 beats/min compared to a rate of 44 +/- 2 beats/min at sea level; cycling of the heart rate, presumably due to periodic breathing, occurred in 14 of 17 studies at altitude but not at sea level (cycles consisted of bradycardia [40 beats/min] for 13 seconds and tachycardia [120 beats/min for 5 seconds]; and arrhythmias were observed in all subjects during sleep and consisted of transient bradycardia (heart rates as low as 20 beats/min), sinus pauses frequently associated with escape rhythms and occasional blocked P waves. No arrhythmias were observed at sea level. Simultaneous records of respiration and the electrocardiogram at 12,500 feet (3,810 m) in 5 other normal subjects revealed tachycardia occurring during hyperpnea and bradycardia occurring during apnea. Data indicate that during sleep in normal young subjects at high altitude, cycling of the heart rate with periodic breathing is common, as are bradyarrhythmias. The mechanism of these arrhythmias has yet to be defined.\r"

LV contractile state was assessed by the analysis of the relation between end-systolic stress and ejection phase index or end-systolic volume. The LV volume and mass closely correlated with the body surface area. The LV mass/end-diastolic volume ratio (0.94 +/- 0.13 g/ml), ejection fraction (0.67 +/- 0.03) and circumferential end-systolic stress (163 +/- 21 kdynes/cm2, 165 +/- 21 g/cm2) remained constant despite the extensive increase in LV volume with physical growth. In all subjects significant inverse correlations were observed between end-systolic stress and ejection fraction or mean normalized systolic ejection rate. The ratio of the circumferential end-systolic stress to end-systolic volume index ranged from 5.00 to 12.57 (7.49 +/- 1.88). The ratio inversely correlated with age (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001), indicating that this ratio for estimating LV contractility is associated with ventricular size. These results suggested that the LV mass increased adequately in response to the extensive increase in LV cavity volume to maintain the end-systolic stress during growth in childhood and that physiologic cardiac growth was associated with appropriate hypertrophy with no significant change in LV contractile state.\r"

Pulsed Doppler recordings were obtained in the parasternal short-axis, right ventricular inflow and apical 4-chamber views at the level of the tricuspid and mitral anuli and 1 cm caudad and 1 cm cephalad to the tricuspid anulus in the 4-chamber apical view. The right ventricular filling pattern was not affected by imaging view. However, placement of the sample volume 1 cm cephalad resulted in a 16% reduction (p less than 0.01) in early velocity with a 9% increase in atrial filling fraction. Conversely, late velocity was 11% higher (p less than 0.05) at the anular level versus the other locations. Right and left ventricular filling velocities were modestly related (r = 0.50 to 0.63). Relations between age and tricuspid late velocity, velocity ratio and atrial filling fraction were weaker (r = 0.34 to 0.47; all p less than 0.05) than those between age and mitral variables (r = 0.59 to 0.74. Also, aging had a greater effect on mitral than tricuspid late velocity (i.e., a steeper slope; p less than 0.01). Tricuspid late velocity and atrial filling fraction were each modestly inversely related to RR interval (r = -0.48, r = -0.54; p less than 0.01). Thus, tricuspid velocity is affected by sample volume location, aging and heart rate, but not imaging view. Sample volume location, heart rate and age should be considered when evaluating right ventricular inflow parameters.\r"

Myocardial ischemia was evaluated by measurement of blood lactate, and wall motion was analyzed using cardiokymographs concurrently and serially. Results show that ST elevation and negative T-wave normalization were most marked in leads containing abnormal Q waves, that ST elevation greater than or equal to 1 mm during pacing was associated with a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and deterioration of left ventricular wall motion and that the magnitude of ST elevation and negative T-wave normalization was significantly correlated, but the latter appeared earlier and more markedly. In addition, there was no significant correlation between the extent of either ST elevation or negative T-wave normalization and myocardial lactate production. Thus, ST elevation and negative T-wave normalization are caused by abnormal left ventricular wall motion rather than myocardial ischemia. Negative T-wave normalization is a more sensitive marker of abnormal wall motion than ST elevation in patients with a previous myocardial infarction.\r"

The role of duration of heparin therapy in maintaining infarct artery patency was studied retrospectively in 53 consecutive AMI patients who received streptokinase therapy and underwent coronary angiography acutely and at 14 +/- 1 days. Of the 39 patients with initial infarct vessel patency, patency at follow-up angiography was observed in 100% (22 of 22) of those who received greater than or equal to 4 days of intravenous heparin but in only 59% (10 of 17) of those patients who received less than 4 days of heparin (p less than 0.05). Of the 14 patients not initially recanalized after streptokinase, patent infarct-related arteries at follow-up angiography were found in 3 of 8 (38%) treated with greater than or equal to 4 days of heparin therapy but in none of the 6 patients treated for less than 4 days (difference not significant). No significant difference in hemorrhagic complications was noted between the short- and long-term heparin treatment groups. Thus, greater than or equal to 4 days of intravenous heparin therapy after successful streptokinase therapy in AMI is more effective in maintaining short-term infarct vessel patency than a shorter duration of therapy and it may maintain the short-term patency of the infarct vessel in those patients who later spontaneously recanalize.\r"

By using stepwise discriminant analysis we selected 3 variables whose linear combination enabled us to correctly allocate 91% of the study population (jacknife procedure; specificity 92%, sensitivity 91%). To substantiate the validity of the results the discriminant function was tested on a new independent population consisting of 27 ischemic patients and 54 normal subjects from another laboratory. A proper allocation was obtained in 86% of the cases (specificity 87%, sensitivity 85%). The large number of correctly classified ischemic patients and the repeatability of the results indicate that the adopted criteria are good markers of ischemic heart disease.\r"

All had routine follow-up angiography 5 to 8 months after PTCA. Restenosis was defined as a 30% decrease in diameter stenosis or a return to greater than 50% stenosis, and progression (in any nondilated site) as a 20% decrease in diameter stenosis, assessed by a video-densitometric computer-assisted technique. Univariate and multivariate analysis with respect to progression was carried out for age, sex, initial unstable angina, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia (greater than or equal to 6.2 mmol), smoking habits, Jenkins' score, dilated artery and restenosis. Forty-one patients (33%) had restenosis, and 23 (19%) had evidence of progression; 20 (87%) of these latter patients had restenosis and 3 (13%) did not. Univariate correlates of progression were: previous myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05), higher Jenkins' score (p less than 0.0003) and restenosis (p less than 0.0001). Restenosis was the only multivariate correlate (p less than 0.00003). Progression at routine angiography after PTCA is not rare, and appears to be related to both the initial extent of coronary artery disease and restenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial lactate metabolism and left ventricular function were studied in 12 patients during angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery performed with distal coronary perfusion (oxygenated and nonoxygenated Fluosol) and by conventional technique without distal perfusion. Before balloon inflation there was net lactate extraction by the heart (31 +/- 6%). During balloon inflations performed with distal perfusion there was net lactate release into the great cardiac vein while the balloon was inflated; the great cardiac vein lactate concentration was approximately 25% lower during perfusion with oxygenated versus nonoxygenated Fluosol (p less than 0.02) indicating less myocardial lactate release. After balloon deflation washout of lactate into the great cardiac vein (net myocardial release) was observed in all 3 protocols. Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by echocardiography decreased markedly during nonperfused (53 +/- 3 to 36 +/- 3%, p less than 0.001) and nonoxygenated Fluosol (52 +/- 2 to 30 +/- 3%, p less than 0.001) inflations. This dysfunction was largely prevented by oxygenated Fluosol where only a minimal decrease in ejection fraction (51 +/- 2 vs 48 +/- 2%, p less than 0.02) occurred. Analysis of regional contractile function yielded similar results. Although oxygenated perfluorocarbons decrease cardiac lactate release during angioplasty, this study provides evidence for the onset of lactate production even when ventricular function is preserved.\r"

To assess the physiologic significance of collaterals, 80 consecutive post-infarction patients (age 58 +/- 8 years) underwent vasodilation-redistribution thallium-201 tomographic imaging after administration of 0.56 mg of intravenous dipyridamole/kg body weight. Circumferential profile analysis of thallium-201 uptake and redistribution in representative left ventricular tomograms provided quantitative assessment of transient and fixed defects and separation between periinfarctional and distant inducible hypoperfusion. Tomographic perfusion data were correlated to wall motion and collateral circulation between distinct anatomic perfusion territories. Patients were grouped according to presence (59%) or absence (41%) of angiographically visible collateral channels to jeopardized myocardium. In the presence of collaterals, distant reversible defects were larger than in absence of collaterals (p less than 0.05); the extent of combined periinfarctional and distant redistribution was also larger in collateralized patients (p less than 0.025), whereas the size of the persistent perfusion defect was similar in both groups. By prospective analysis the tomographic perfusion pattern of combined periinfarctional and distant redistribution revealed a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 78% for the detection of significant collateral circulation in this group of patients. Thus, using the exhausted flow reserve as a diagnostic tool, vasodilation-thallium-201 tomography has the potential to identify and quantitate collateralized myocardium in post-infarction patients and may guide diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making.\r"

The leads examined were those of 1 manufacturer (Medtronic) and consisted of 3 ventricular pacing leads (model numbers 6957 unipolar screw-in [11 patients], 6961 unipolar tined [12 patients] and 6962 bipolar tined [7 patients]) and 1 atrial lead (model number 6957J unipolar screw-in [10 patients]). After optimal lead position was obtained fluoroscopically in the right ventricular apex or right atrium, the pacing threshold and R- or P-wave amplitudes were measured at 5-minute intervals for 30 minutes. The acute ventricular pacing threshold with the screw-in lead was significantly higher than with the tined lead (0.84 +/- 0.17 vs 0.58 +/- 0.15 volts; p less than 0.001). There was a significant (p less than 0.001) acute decrease in the ventricular pacing threshold with both lead types, with the maximum decrease occurring 5 minutes after lead implantation. There was a significant acute increase in R-wave size with the ventricular screw-in lead that peaked 20 minutes after lead implantation (11.9 +/- 3.0 to 14.7 +/- 4.1 mV; p less than 0.001). The atrial screw-in lead behaved in a manner identical to its counterpart in the ventricle. In conclusion, there are acute changes in the pacing threshold and R- or P-wave amplitude obtained with tined and screw-in pacing leads.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Juvenile papillomatosis (JP) is a benign proliferative breast tumor rarely found in women older than 30 years of age that may exhibit considerable histologic atypia. Often these findings would be regarded as precancerous in older patients. Rarely, carcinoma and JP have been coexistent at diagnosis, but little is known about the risk for development of carcinoma after excisional biopsy of JP. To examine this issue, the authors reviewed a series of 41 patients with JP who had biopsies between 1960 and 1978 with a median follow-up of 14 years. Age at diagnosis ranged from 15 to 35 years (median, 19 years), whereas at last follow-up the patients were 22-48 years old (median, 36 years). Overall, 21 (58%) reported a positive family history for breast carcinoma, with mothers and maternal aunts being at highest risk. Six had bilateral JP. Subsequent breast carcinoma was diagnosed in four (10%) of the patients with JP. All of these patients were unusual because they had recurrent and bilateral JP. In two instances the changes were multifocal. Each had a positive family history for breast carcinoma. In this series, none of the patients with nonrecurrent unilateral, unicentric JP has thus far had subsequent mammary carcinoma develop. When counseling the JP patient one should take care not to exaggerate her near term risk for development of carcinoma. The present data suggest that concern should be greatest for women with a positive family history and recurrent bilateral JP.\r"

The authors therefore investigated immunohistochemically four polyps of this type with a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, including those directed against intermediate filaments, steroid hormone receptors, and macrophage antigens. The authors found that the atypical stromal cells of FEPV expressed vimentin, desmin, and receptors for estrogen and progesterone but lacked all the other markers studied. The homogenous antigen profile strongly suggests that FEPV form a disease entity whose characteristic cells are special hormone-sensitive stromal cells with a myoid component of differentiation. Morphologically similar stromal cells expressing steroid hormone receptors but lacking desmin were found in myxomatoid subepithelial regions of the vaginal wall and the cervix.\r"

  ".W": "Several retrospective studies suggest that abnormal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content in colorectal carcinoma correlates with adverse clinical outcome. Many of these studies have used naked nuclei retrieved from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues for flow cytometry. The purpose of this study was to prospectively analyze 137 colorectal carcinomas using fresh whole-cell suspensions for flow cytometry and to determine whether abnormal DNA content (DNA aneuploidy or tumors with high proliferative activity) correlates with Dukes' stage, histologic grade, lymphocytic infiltration of the tumor, tumor fibrosis, extramural venous spread, or tumor size. Cell suspensions for flow cytometry were prepared by enzyme disaggregation with collagenase XI, DNase, and trypsin. Satisfactory DNA histograms were obtained from 132 of the 137 samples. The mean coefficients of variance for the G1/G0 of the external 2C control, internal 2C populations, and aneuploid populations were 2.5, 3.5, and 3.5, respectively. The mean percentage of viable cells was 97%. Of 132 cases, 102 (77%) demonstrated abnormal DNA histograms, of which 77 (58%) showed DNA aneuploidy. Abnormal DNA histograms of DNA aneuploidy did not correlate with Dukes' stage. Tumors of higher histologic grade were more likely to demonstrate DNA aneuploidy, however, these differences did not reach statistical significance. The authors conclude that (1) satisfactory DNA histograms can be obtained with the use of a fresh, whole-cell technique; (2) abnormal DNA histograms did not statistically correlate with standard clinical, grading, or staging parameters; and (3) carcinomas of high histologic grade showed an increased proportion of aneuploid DNA histograms, but this trend did not reach statistical significance.\r"

These samples, compared with fresh tissue, tend to show a broader DNA distribution, appearing as a wide (high) coefficient of variation (CV) of the G0/G1 peak. To address the question of whether there may be aneuploid populations hidden in wide CV diploid G0/G1 peaks, the authors measured DNA content in nuclei extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue by morphometric image analysis (IA) in addition to FCM. Of 29 samples showing little evidence of DNA aneuploidy by FCM, in 20 of 20 with G0/G1 CVs greater than or equal to 5.50% there was an aneuploid population when analysis was performed by IA. Of the remaining nine samples with CVs less than or equal to 4.41%, all were diploid in the G0/G1 region by both FCM and IA. The presence of aneuploid populations in FCM distributions with wide CV G0/G1 peaks can be confirmed by IA.\r"

Of these 37 cases the adrenal glands were affected by CMV in 84%. The authors analyzed the histologic features of 30 of these 37 cases of CMV adrenalitis by grading the CMV inclusions, inflammation and necrosis (CMV score), focal versus diffuse involvement, and the degree of fibrosis (fibrosis score). The clinical data were not significant except for sodium to potassium ratio (Na:K), which was less than 30 in 11 cases. Focal CMV adrenalitis had low CMV and fibrosis scores and Na:K ratio higher than 30, whereas diffuse adrenalitis had high CMV and fibrosis scores and Na:K ratio less than 30. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests performed in three patients revealed normal or elevated baseline cortisol levels with a blunted response after stimulation. The authors conclude that the adrenal gland is the most frequently affected organ in AIDS with CMV infection. ACTH tests on a larger number of selected cases of AIDS are needed for further evaluation of functional status of adrenal glands. Selection criteria for the test should include evidence of CMV infection from any site and a low Na:K ratio.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils are considered fragile cells, easily damaged by improper handling. Assays of neutrophil function frequently require preliminary isolation procedures that may be potentially harmful. The authors did an extensive investigation of the effects of currently used isolation procedures on a broad spectrum of functional assays that included: 1) phagocytosis; 2) bacterial killing by a culture technique and tritiated thymidine labeling; 3) candidacidal activity by methylene blue dye exclusion and differential Giemsa staining; 4) quantitative unstimulated and histochemical stimulated nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction; 5) chemiluminescence; 6) random locomotion; and 7) chemotaxis by the agarose method. In addition, cells were examined morphologically by electron microscopy, and the granule density was quantitated by morphometric analysis. Isolation techniques included erythrocyte sedimentation, hypotonic lysis, gradient density separation using Ficoll-Hypaque, and counterflow centrifugal elutriation. The purest neutrophil suspensions were obtained by density gradient separation and counterflow centrifugal elutriation with mean neutrophil percentages of greater than or equal to 94%. Regardless of the isolation procedure, neutrophils were similar in all groups (P greater than .05) in the following studies: phagocytosis, nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction, bacterial killing, candidal killing, inhibition of candidal germ tube formation, and cytoplasmic granulation. Differences were noted in assays of neutrophil migration and chemiluminescence. Neutrophil suspensions isolated by counterflow centrifugal elutriation and Ficoll-Hypaque had the highest scores for random migration and chemotaxis. These differences can be related to the purity of the neutrophil suspension rather than the harmful effects of the isolation procedures. Erythrocyte contamination affected both the slope and the time to peak response in the chemiluminescence assay. Exposure of neutrophils to cold temperatures (0-4 degrees C) for 1.5 hours impaired both random locomotion and chemotaxis. Current recommendations for the storage, transport, and preparation of leukocytes for neutrophil function studies need to be reassessed.\r"

Twenty-five lung biopsies and one heart biopsy had detectable cytomegalovirus DNA by in situ hybridization. As compared to histopathology, in situ hybridization had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99%. None of the biopsies had detectable herpes simplex or adenovirus by either in situ hybridization or routine histopathology. In situ hybridization studies may be of greatest use when the results of conventional histopathology are equivocal and in the patients with radiologic or clinical evidence of pulmonary disease.\r"

According to the preventative heparin dose schedule based on the TFA measured by the TSA, all disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was controlled successfully. The procedure of the TSA was too complicated for clinical use, and its minimal measurable value was 125 units (U)/L of TFA. The OSA-dIX was simpler in its procedure and sensitive enough to measure accurately a TFA quantity as small as 30 U/L with high reproducibility. In 20 ANLL patients with 125 U/L or more of TFA measured by both assays, there was a significant relationship between their logarithms of TFA (r = 0.93, P less than 0.01). These results suggested that DIC complication in ANLL patients would be controlled successfully by the administration of heparin dosage based on the TFA measured by the OSA-dIX.\r"

A 24-hour urine protein collection was followed by individual collections of each sequentially voided specimen over the same time interval. Samples were analyzed quantitatively for protein, and protein electrophoresis was performed on each specimen. Only one patient had BJ protein nondetectable by protein electrophoresis in the early morning specimen. Six patients had one or more random specimens (excluding the early morning specimens) absent for BJ protein on protein electrophoresis. Three patients had nondetectable protein on electrophoresis of the 24-hour specimen despite having some random specimens positive. All random specimens with protein values exceeding 0.20 g/L had BJ protein visibly detectable on electrophoresis. Thirteen specimens with protein less than 0.05 g/L still had BJ protein detected by electrophoresis. There was a linear relationship between the early morning protein concentration and the total 24-hour urinary protein production. The authors conclude that early morning specimens or 24-hour urine collections are preferable for the detection and monitoring of light chain proteinuria. These collection methods are not mutually exclusive because there are individual patients who will be negative in one collection but positive in the other.\r"

  ".W": "Advances in the preparation of commercial Factor VIII concentrates have decreased the clinical use of cryoprecipitate to replace Factor VIII coagulant activity. Cryoprecipitate is now frequently transfused as a source of fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor (vWF). The minimum acceptable content of Factor VIII is prescribed, but no attempt is made to optimize, standardize, or assess the content of fibrinogen or vWF in cryo. If reasonably accurate information on the composition of cryoprecipitate were available, the physician could calculate an appropriate dose of cryo, thus avoiding unnecessary donor exposures and waste of product. This study was designed to measure the functionally active vWF and fibrinogen in cryoprecipitate prepared by three techniques in an attempt to optimize the yield of these hemostatically important components, and to obtain accurate information on the composition of the product. Cryoprecipitate was made from 82 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as follows: (1) most of the supernatant plasma was expressed from \"dry\" cryo; (2) about 15 mL of plasma was left in each \"regular\" unit; and (3) \"overnight\" units were made from FFP thawed overnight in a refrigerator rather than in a 4 degrees C water bath as for the dry and regular units. Dry, regular, and overnight units had volumes of 8.8 +/- 1.5, 16.6 +/- 3.9, and 15.1 +/- 2.4 mL/bag, respectively. Dry cryoprecipitate units had significantly less fibrinogen and vWF than regular or overnight units. The vWF multimer pattern for all three types of cryoprecipitate was indistinguishable from that of normal pooled plasma. Thus, the amount of plasma expressed during preparation has a significant impact on the vWF and fibrinogen content of the resulting product. The amounts of these clinically important proteins should be assayed as a step toward rational determination of optimal cryoprecipitate doses in specific clinical settings.\r"

The identical meal, with the addition of a slice of onion, was ingested on a counterbalanced day. Variables measured were number of reflux episodes, percentage of the time pH was less than four, heartburn episodes, and belches. Ingestion of onions did not increase any of the reflux variables measured in normals. However, onions significantly increased all measures in heartburn subjects, compared with the no-onion condition, and compared with normals under the onion condition. Onions can be a potent and long-lasting refluxogenic agent in heartburn patients.\r"

  ".W": "The use of arbitrarily predefined time intervals during the circadian cycle is common practice in 24-h studies of gastric acidity. To determine whether slight displacements of a given time interval can be responsible for relevant changes in the acidity indexes calculated from pH profiles, we analyzed pH frequency distributions, and individual median and mean pH levels in three different, commonly adopted nocturnal time windows related to 132 curves obtained with single bedtime (10 PM) doses of various H2-antagonists. The time period 12 PM-8 AM has significantly less acid values (p less than 0.001) than the other two (10 PM-6 AM and 8 PM-8 AM), and therefore identifies the drugs' actions more closely. The individual median pH levels describe the H2-antagonist effect in 93% of profiles in the former time segment, whereas the percentage of accuracy is significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in both remaining periods (73% and 67%, respectively). The corresponding percentages of the individual mean pH levels are similar, even though their decline is less evident in the 10 PM-6 AM and 8 PM-8 AM time intervals. Our findings suggest that 1) slight shiftings of arbitrarily predefined time segments are associated with relevant fluctuations of acidity indexes and, therefore, should be standardized whenever possible, in order to favor international comparisons of results; 2) time intervals should be set to fit in as closely as possible with the drug-induced alkalinization wave; 3) pH frequency distribution should always be calculated and taken into careful consideration.\r"

  ".U": "90224925\r", 
  ".W": "We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of blind brushing of the esophagus via nasogastric tube in 66 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (N = 59), or AIDS-related complex (ARC), (N = 7)] complaining of odynophagia and/or dysphagia. Brushings were obtained between 20 and 35 cm from the incisors. Patients then underwent upper endoscopy with directed brushings and biopsies; esophageal lavage was also done in the first 40 patients. Candida esophagitis was defined as an abnormal appearance of the esophageal mucosa, together with microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae in the endoscopic brushings or invasive candidiasis on biopsy. The presence of oral thrush was also recorded. Candida esophagitis was present in 28 (42%) of the 66 patients. Blind brushings diagnosed candidiasis in 27/28 cases and produced five false positives (sensitivity 96%, specificity 87%). Blind brushing of the esophagus was significantly more sensitive than the presence of oral thrush for the diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis (p = 0.02). Oral thrush was found in only 20/28 cases of Candida esophagitis and in eight patients without Candida (sensitivity 71%, specificity 79%). Esophageal lavage yielded Candida in all cases (sensitivity 100%) but had a poor specificity (64%). We conclude that blind brushing of the esophagus is a rapid, safe, and economical way to diagnose Candida esophagitis in patients with AIDS. This procedure can be performed by primary care physicians with minimal loss of sensitivity and specificity as compared to endoscopy.\r"

  ".U": "90224927\r", 
  ".W": "An exaggerated increase in meal-stimulated gastrin is a common finding in patients with duodenal ulcer. Duodenal ulcer patients also exhibit an increase in the number of parietal cells, which results in an increase in maximum acid output. There are also data to suggest that acid hypersecretion may not predate the ulcer disease, but is acquired, possibly due to the trophic effects of the exaggerated gastrin release on parietal cells. We investigated meal-stimulated gastrin release in nine Helicobacter pylori-infected individuals; eight patients with chronic duodenal ulcer and one H. pylori-infected healthy control, both before and after therapy designed to eradicate H. pylori infection. We also simultaneously measured intragastric pH in six duodenal ulcer patients. Eradication of the H. pylori infection reversed the exaggerated meal-stimulated gastrin release (gastrin secretion fell from 141 + 16 pg/ml/h before treatment to 98 +/- 7 pg/ml/h after, p less than 0.01) without affecting intragastric pH. Whereas exaggerated meal-stimulated gastrin release may be an important pathogenetic feature of duodenal ulcer disease, we conclude that it is secondary to the H. pylori infection. This study provides further insight into the role of H. pylori in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer disease. We postulate that reversal of the abnormalities in gastrin secretion will be associated with a gradual return of gastric secretion to normal.\r"

Our study compared the outcome of the breath test to the results of histology and culture of endoscopically obtained gastric biopsies in 84 patients. The breath test discriminated well between the 50 positive patients and the 34 patients negative for Helicobacter pylori: the calculated sensitivity was 100%, specificity 88%, positive predictive value 93%, and negative predictive value 100%. Treatment with bismuth subsalicylate and/or ampicillin resulted in lower counts of exhaled 14CO2 which correlated with histological improvement in gastritis. The 14C-urea breath test is a better \"gold standard\" for the detection of Helicobacter pylori than histology and/or culture.\r"

Since macromolecular complexes were not fixed by protein A, it seems unlikely that lipase is attached to IgG. Tests of the sera from 20 patients with raised serum lipase activity in acute pancreatitis or an acute episode of chronic pancreatitis revealed, in two patients, that a small but reproducible proportion of the total lipase activity eluted in the region of the macrolipase. In addition, 10% and 18% of the total lipase activity was found in the elution region of the macrolipase in two commercial pooled sera used for quality control. The results show that, in rare cases, macrolipasemia must be considered a possible cause of raised serum lipase activity.\r"

The pathologist's opinion often determines the course of medical follow-up for the patient, especially in cases in which early malignancy is suspected. This paper addresses the agreement of community-based pathologists regarding the interpretation of colorectal polyp pathology. Ten pathological slide sections were sent to 22 different community-based pathologists in southeast Michigan. These pathologists were asked to record their diagnosis of the specific histologies represented in each of the slides. The results indicated a high level of agreement of histologies in the dichotomous categories of hyperplasia versus adenoma. However, there was considerable disagreement on the presence of moderate or severe atypia. The results of this study indicate that clinicians performing biopsies on patients at risk for colorectal cancer should be aware of the potential for diagnostic variability among pathologists, and should plan follow-up strategies which may include seeking second pathological opinions when a significant patient management decision must be made.\r"

Patients with AH had lower peripheral blood lymphocyte counts with corresponding decreases in T-cell subset numbers that were persistent in the serial evaluations. T8 cells were disproportionately decreased, with a significant resultant increase in the T4:T8 ratios. Compared with controls, AH patients had significantly smaller cutaneous responses to Candida albicans antigen (p less than 0.05) and mumps antigen (p less than 0.005). Fifty-eight percent of patients were anergic when tested with a battery of four antigens. Patients with AH had increased concanavalin A-, but not phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte proliferative responses. These serial analyses confirm previous observations of cell-mediated immune dysfunction in patients with severe AH. Moreover, there is a persistence of these abnormalities for at least 6 wk after withdrawal from alcohol.\r"

In all four of these patients, the enzymes normalized within 1 wk of corticosteroid substitution treatment. Liver biopsy in one patient revealed discrete lymphocytic infiltrates in the portal zones.

Patients at high risk of this complication can be identified, and special techniques can be used to avoid perforation. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is an alternative to nasogastric intubation for long-term enteral feeding. When nasogastric intubation is performed, clinical tests of tube position are not sufficient to guarantee proper tube position. The tip of the tube must be visualized radiographically in the stomach prior to initiation of tube feeding. When perforation does occur, proper management is often controversial. Therapy must be tailored to each individual case for the best possible outcome.\r"

This study examined the nature, frequency, treatment, incidence of complications, and emergency department deaths of patients seeking medical care for acute and chronic cocaine-associated medical problems. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 233 hospital visits by 216 cocaine-using patients over a 6-month period during 1986 and 1987 was studied. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to determine patient characteristics, nature of complications, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: Patients most commonly used cocaine intravenously (49%), but freebase or crack use was also common (23.3%). Concomitant abuse of other intoxicants, especially alcohol, was frequently seen (48.5%). The vast majority of complaints were cardiopulmonary (56.2%), neurologic (39.1%), and psychiatric (35.8%); multiple symptoms were often present (57.5%). The most common complaint was chest pain though rarely was it believed to represent ischemia. Altered mental status was common (27.4%) and ranged from psychosis to coma. Short-term pharmacologic intervention was necessary in only 24% of patients, and only 9.9% of patients were admitted. Acute mortality was less than 1%. CONCLUSION: Most medical complications of cocaine are short-lived and appear to be related to cocaine's hyperadrenergic effects. Patients usually do not require short-term therapy or hospital admission. Acute morbidity and mortality rates from cocaine use in patients presenting to the hospital are very low, suggesting that a major focus in the treatment of cocaine-related emergencies should be referral for drug abuse detoxification and treatment.\r"

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from an ongoing prospective study of 1,014 male medical students enrolled in the graduating classes of 1948-1964 at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The cohort, now physicians aged 52 to 68 years, has been contacted regularly since medical school to identify major disease. In 1986, the CAGE alcoholism screening questionnaire was administered. Alcohol abuse was defined as self-admitted alcoholism, excessive consumption of four or more beverages per day on average, or a score of 2 or higher on the CAGE questionnaire. RESULTS: By these criteria, 131 of 1,014 (12.9%) patients abused alcohol. Medical school precursors associated (p less than 0.05) with subsequent alcohol abuse were as follows: non-Jewish ancestry (relative odds [RO] = 3.1), lack of religious affiliation (RO = 4.1), cigarette use of one pack or more per day (RO = 2.6), regular use of alcohol (RO = 3.6), anxiety (RO = 1.8) or anger (RO = 1.8) as a reaction to stress, frequent use of alcohol in nonsocial settings (RO = 1.6), past history of alcohol-related difficulty (RO = 3.1), and maternal alcoholism or mental illness (RO = 1.9). Precursors found not to be associated with alcohol abuse included sleep habits, use of sedatives or amphetamines, interest in athletics or hobbies, and parental relationship. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that there are several identifiable medical school precursors of alcohol abuse in physicians.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Inappropriate administration of intravenous verapamil to patients with wide QRS complex tachycardia due to ventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome occurs frequently because of misdiagnosis, and may precipitate a cardiac arrest. We evaluated the safety and the diagnostic and therapeutic utility of adenosine triphosphate administered to a consecutive series of 34 patients during wide QRS complex tachycardia due to a variety of mechanisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who had a hemodynamically and electrically stable, monomorphic, wide (greater than 120 msec) QRS complex tachycardia induced during an invasive cardiac electrophysiologic test were studied. Hemodynamic stability was defined by a systolic blood pressure greater than 80 mm Hg and no clinical evidence of cerebral or myocardial ischemia. Adenosine triphosphate, 20 mg, was administered as a rapid intravenous bolus via a peripheral vein during wide QRS complex tachycardia. Five surface electrocardiogram leads, at least three intracardiac electrograms, and blood pressure were monitored. RESULTS: Ventricular tachycardia was present in 14 patients (mean age 50.6 +/- 19 years, cycle length 326 +/- 67 msec) and adenosine triphosphate terminated the arrhythmia in one case. Ventricular tachycardia cycle length did not change. Among 10 patients with supraventricular tachycardia with mechanisms not involving the AV node (average ventricular cycle length 346 +/- 82 msec), one case of ectopic atrial tachycardia was terminated. The ventricular rate was transiently increased in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation (average R-R interval 351 +/- 84 msec in control and 317 +/- 82 msec after adenosine triphosphate, p less than 0.001). Reentrant tachycardias involving the AV node (cycle length 302 +/- 52 msec) terminated in seven of 10 patients. The drug was well tolerated, and no patient developed hemodynamic compromise necessitating cardioversion as a result of adenosine triphosphate. CONCLUSION: In the setting of electrophysiology testing, adenosine triphosphate is a safe agent, even when administered inappropriately during arrhythmias for which it is relatively ineffective, such as ventricular tachycardia, and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with atrial fibrillation. It is an effective agent in terminating supraventricular tachycardia involving the AV node. Tachycardia termination following adenosine triphosphate, when used as a diagnostic test to indicate obligatory participation of the AV node, had a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 92%, and a positive predictive accuracy of 85%. Thus, adenosine triphosphate also has diagnostic utility, but should be used after the appropriate arrhythmia diagnosis has been made based on the clinical history and analysis of the 12-lead electrocardiogram.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven men and three women, 46 to 85 years of age (eight with pancreatic carcinoma, one with metastatic colon, and one with metastatic ovarian carcinoma), all had reobstruction after initial surgical bypass palliation. Subsequent attempts to place stents via endoscope failed in five patients; a pair of 7-Fr stents placed in one patient failed to drain well. Endoscopic stenting in four patients was not even attempted because of severely distorted anatomy. Nine of the 10 patients then had successful internal stent placement by a combined percutaneous-transhepatic and peroral-endoscopically guided technique. RESULTS: One of these nine placeable stents failed to drain well and the patient died 8 days later with massive tumor. Seven showed a significant decrease in bilirubin levels and improved quality of life. Two of these had sepsis that responded to antibiotics. Life span ranged between 11 days and 10 months, with one patient still alive; no deaths were directly due to stents. CONCLUSION: A combined transhepatic-peroral technique of placing internalized biliary stents can be expected to result in repalliation in a majority of patients with reobstruction after earlier surgical bypass and in whom subsequent attempts at endoscopic placement of stents have failed or in whom tumor growth prevents undertaking the endoscopic approach.\r"

  ".U": "90224994\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Patients with hyponatremia due to tuberculosis have shown variable responses to water loading in previous small studies, ranging from persistent antidiuresis to a normal diuresis. Although tuberculosis is considered a cause of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), circulating vasopressin has been documented in only a few cases. We studied a larger group of patients to determine whether it can be suppressed by a short-term reduction in osmolality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight hyponatremic patients (mean age +/- SD: 40 +/- 10 years) with pulmonary or miliary tuberculosis underwent a clinical evaluation, measurement of blood and urine chemistry values, and (in 22) a water load of 20 mL/kg. Volume status was evaluated by urine sodium concentration, blood and urine urea nitrogen, and plasma renin activity. Endocrine, renal, and other recognized causes of SIADH were excluded. RESULTS: All 22 patients exhibited a decline in urine osmolality and an increase in free water clearance after water loading. Water excretion was fully normal in seven of 22, with the remainder showing variable impairment of diluting ability and/or volume excreted. Plasma vasopressin, measured in 11 of 22 patients as well as in six others not subjected to water loading, was detectable despite hypo-osmolality in 16 of 17. Vasopressin levels declined after water loading, from 1.85 +/- 1.32 to 0.77 +/- 0.25 pg/mL (p less than 0.05). The majority of patients had the euthyroid sick syndrome but normal adrenal responses to cosyntropin. Although several patients had mild volume depletion when studied, this factor did not appear to explain the defect in water excretion. Hyponatremia resolved predictably within days to weeks of antituberculous therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating vasopressin remains detectable in hyponatremic patients with tuberculosis and is responsive to changes in osmolality. A downsetting of osmoregulation induced by active tuberculosis (\"reset osmostat\") could explain this abnormality, but we cannot exclude an unidentified non-osmotic stimulus that can be counteracted by water loading.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical course of 44 patients under the age of 45 with the diagnosis of ET was reviewed in a retrospective manner. Patients were collected from three medical centers in the United States and Italy: the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard Community Health Plan, Boston, Massachusetts, and the Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy. RESULTS: The overall incidence of hemorrhage or thrombosis, or both, in this group of patients was 39% (17 of 44), with serious complications occurring in 23% (10 of 44). Two patients died of thrombotic events. Neither the presence of symptoms at diagnosis nor any single laboratory parameter proved predictive of clinical sequelae. Treatment with antiplatelet drugs or platelet-lowering agents was not protective. CONCLUSION: We conclude that ET in young patients may result in serious and life-threatening hemostatic problems and consequently that young age is not a favorable prognostic factor in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between diabetes and the development of some peripheral arterial findings--carotid and femoral bruits and nonpalpable pedal pulse--and acute cardiovascular events in 1,196 men and 1,582 women based on 20-year follow-up data in the Framingham Study. RESULTS: For both men and women without diabetes, the incidence of carotid bruits and nonpalapble pedal pulses increased significantly with age (p less than 0.05) without any apparent male predominance. In contrast, diabetic men and women were at an elevated risk of each peripheral arterial condition that was not appreciably different across age groups. Compared with women without diabetes, those with diabetes experienced nearly a twofold excess of femoral bruits (p less than 0.05) and a 50% excess of nonpalpable pedal pulses (p less than 0.01). Among men, diabetes nearly doubled the risk of carotid bruits (p less than 0.05). Those who had both diabetes and symptoms of peripheral arterial disease were at especially high risk of incident cardiovascular events. In particular, nonpalpable pedal pulses were associated with more than a twofold excess of coronary heart disease (p less than 0.05) and stroke (p less than 0.01) in diabetic women and more than a twofold excess of coronary heart disease and cardiac failure in diabetic men (p less than 0.01). Femoral bruits doubled the risk of coronary heart disease in diabetic men (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that while diabetes predisposes to various forms and locations of peripheral arterial disease, the enhanced risk of acute cardiovascular events experienced by diabetic patients is increased further when diabetes is accompanied by indications of a peripheral arterial condition. Since signs of peripheral arterial disease may suggest an impending or coexistent atherosclerotic process, careful examination of arterial circulation by evaluating peripheral pulses and assessing whether bruits are present is important.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To identify clinical findings useful in estimating the probability of acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 355 symptomatic patients who underwent ascending venography were reviewed. Data on 76 clinical items were collected using standardized forms. Venograms were interpreted according to standard criteria and interobserver agreement was evaluated in a sample of 119 venograms. Independent clinical correlates of proximal DVT were identified using multivariate discriminant analysis in 236 randomly chosen patients; they were tested in the remaining 119 patients. RESULTS: Acute proximal DVT was shown by venogram in 96 patients (27%). Five independent clinical correlates of proximal DVT--swelling above the knee of the affected leg, swelling below the knee, recent immobility, cancer, fever--predicted proximal DVT in the testing group; in patients with none, one, or two or more of these clinical findings, proximal DVT was present in 5%, 15%, and 42%, respectively. If venography had been performed only in patients with one or more of the five factors, 97% of cases of proximal DVT would have been diagnosed and venography would have been avoided in 26% of patients with normal test results. CONCLUSION: These data provide a quantitative basis for estimating the probability of proximal DVT on the basis of clinical findings in symptomatic patients. How these findings can best be integrated with noninvasive testing and venography into diagnostic strategies for DVT remains to be determined.\r"

To address this issue, we studied the incidence of choroid plexus cysts and other ultrasonographic abnormalities in 26 consecutive fetuses (13.5 to 36 weeks' gestation) with trisomy 18. Twenty of these 26 fetuses had major sonographic anomalies suggestive of aneuploidy. Seventeen of these 26 fetuses were 15 to 20 weeks and 5 of 17 (30%) had choroid plexus cysts. Six of our total 26 affected fetuses had no sonographic anomalies and therefore, on the basis of our data, 30% of these (1.8 fetuses) with trisomy 18 would have choroid plexus cysts without other findings. The incidence of choroid plexus cysts in all second-trimester fetuses (including normal fetuses and those with trisomy 18) is reportedly 1%. Given the known incidence of trisomy 18 (3/10,000), we calculated a total presumptive sample of 86,667 patients to yield our 26 fetuses with trisomy 18. Our hypothetical sample has 86,641 (86,667 - 26) fetuses without trisomy 18,858 of which would have choroid plexus cysts. Thus there would be one fetus with trisomy 18 for every 477 normal fetuses with choroid plexus cysts with no other defect seen. If amniocentesis were done to seek trisomy 18 in all second-trimester fetuses with choroid plexus cysts, two normal fetuses would be lost for every one with trisomy 18 identified.\r"

After a 12-hour overnight fast, plasma glucose (95 +/- 4 vs. 78 +/- 2 mg/dl; p less than 0.01), insulin (32 +/- 5 vs. 17 +/- 2 microU/ml; p less than 0.02), and free fatty acid (860 +/- 63 vs. 639 +/- 79 mmol/L; p less than 0.05) levels were higher in the patients with gestational diabetes mellitus. 3-Hydroxybutyrate levels were similar in the two groups at that time (0.23 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.03 mmol/L; p greater than 0.3). When the fast was extended to 18 hours by having the patients skip breakfast, glucose levels fell more rapidly in the group with gestational diabetes mellitus but remained elevated compared with the nondiabetic women. Insulin levels declined at a similar rate in the two groups. Free fatty acid levels did not increase significantly in the group with gestational diabetes mellitus during the extended fast. In contrast, free fatty acid levels increased by 44% in the normal pregnant women, reaching the level observed in the group with gestational diabetes mellitus after 18 hours. 3-Hydroxybutyrate levels remained virtually identical in the two groups throughout the brief fast. Thus, compared with that of normal pregnant women, the response of obese women with gestational diabetes mellitus to brief caloric deprivation during late pregnancy was characterized by a greater fall in plasma glucose values without a greater propensity to ketosis. Our findings may have important implications for the dietary management of obese patients with gestational diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "We longitudinally assessed intrauterine ultrasonic growth parameters (biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length) in 60 pairs of concordant twins. Head circumference to abdominal circumference and femur length to abdominal circumference ratios were calculated. Estimated fetal weight curves were created with the formula of Shepard et al., incorporating biparietal diameter and abdominal circumference, as well as that of Hadlock et al., incorporating femur length and abdominal circumference. Biparietal diameter was obtained in only 79% of fetuses, whereas femur length and abdominal circumference were obtained in 96% and 99% of fetuses, respectively. The intrauterine growth of abdominal circumference appears to be linear between 18 and 40 weeks, fitting the simple equation abdominal circumference = -4.5 + 0.97 gestational age (gestational age in weeks). The mean femur length to abdominal circumference ratio is 22.4 +/- 1.5 and appears to be gestational age independent between 20 and 40 weeks. The head circumference to abdominal circumference ratio decreases as gestational age advances in a linear fashion. Estimated fetal weight curves by the formulas of both Shepard et al. and Hadlock et al. fit second-order polynomial equations. Neither formula appears to be superior in estimating fetal weight in twin gestations, although that of Hadlock et al. can be used more frequently since biparietal diameter cannot always be obtained in both twins.\r"

  ".U": "90225032\r", 
  ".W": "To develop an improved means for evaluation of the outcome of fetal growth in utero, a growth study of 37 fetuses at risk for intrauterine growth retardation was undertaken. Intrauterine growth was evaluated with ultrasonography at 2- to 3-week intervals beginning at 15 weeks' gestation. Measurements obtained in the second trimester were used to specify Rossavik growth models for various anatomic parameters. Values for weight, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and thigh circumference at birth were predicted with the use of these models. Growth potential realization index values for these four parameters were calculated from actual and predicted birth measurements. The growth potential realization index values were combined to form a neonatal growth assessment score. With the use of cluster analysis and neonatal growth assessment score values, the 37 infants were separated into 24 group I (neonatal growth assessment score values between 3.7 and 18.6) and 13 group II (neonatal growth assessment score values between 19.4 and 50.0) infants. In group I, 66.7% of the infants had no growth abnormalities; a single abnormality, usually borderline, was found in an additional 20.8% (total = 87.5%). In group II all infants had growth abnormalities (range, 2 to 6) although only 46.2% had birth weights below the 10th percentile. No differences in risk factors (except for the incidence of smoking) or second trimester growth were found in these two groups. The neonatal growth assessment score appears to be a sensitive indicator of third trimester growth retardation, is not affected by differences in growth potential, can separate normal infants from those with evidence of intrauterine growth retardation, and provides a quantitative assessment of growth problems in individual fetuses.\r"

Furthermore, specimen adequacy for analysis varies. To determine whether these phenomena are correlated with menstrual cycle stage at the time of sampling, we analyzed cervical cell specimens from women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Specimens were categorized on the basis of a 28-day menstrual cycle and were analyzed by hybridization to combined probes for virus types 6 and 11 or types 16 and 18. Specimen adequacy was determined by hybridization to a human Alu I repetitive deoxyribonucleic acid probe. Analysis of data with chi 2 revealed that fluctuations in virus detection and type variation are unrelated to menstrual cycle stage. Specimen adequacy is stage-dependent for women who take oral contraceptives. Whereas specimens can be collected at any time other than the first week of the menstrual cycle, accurate determination of infection status requires multiple assessments.\r"

We compared two risk scores, one including known risk factors (maternal characteristics and symptoms reported by women), and the other including these factors and the findings of vaginal examination. These risk scores were computed by multiplying the adjusted odds ratio estimations obtained by logistic regressions. The prediction of preterm delivery was improved significantly by vaginal examination at 25 to 28 weeks' and 29 to 31 weeks' gestation. However, the improvement was not very large: when 30% of nulliparous women were classified as high risk at 29 to 31 weeks, the sensitivity was 55% when considering only the risk factors and 63% when adding the findings of vaginal examination; the percentages were 52% and 55%, respectively, for parous women. These results partially explain why the medical practice of routine vaginal examinations varies from country to country.\r"

With the patch clamp technique with 120 mmol/L cesium-20 mmol/L tetraethylammonium in the pipette, the inward current was evoked by a depolarizing pulse above -40 mV from a holding potential of -60 mV and maximum amplitude was obtained at 0 mV. At a holding potential of -100 mV, the inward current could be evoked with less positive depolarizing pulses, and the membrane potential that evoked the maximum amplitude of inward current was shifted to a more negative potential. Single-channel current recording revealed that two types of calcium channels existed in human pregnant myometrium, with single-channel conductances of 12 and 29 pS. One of the calcium channels (12 pS) was inactivated at a holding potential of -60 mV.\r"

  ".W": "Prolactin production by decidualized human endometrium has been demonstrated in organ explant cultures and presumed to be of stromal origin by immunocytochemistry and the presence of simultaneous stromal histologic changes. To test the hypothesis that endometrial prolactin production is exclusively of stromal origin, late proliferative human endometrium was separated into glands and stroma and cultured for 3 days. Confluent cultures were incubated with progesterone, 50 ng/ml; estradiol, 5 ng/ml; or both progesterone and estradiol for 4, 8, and 15 days. Prolactin concentration was measured at 2-day intervals by specific radioimmunoassay throughout a 15-day culture in all samples. Aromatase activity at 15 days was assayed by the production of tritiated water from 1 beta 3H-androstenedione. Possible contamination of gland cultures by stromal cells was controlled by the substitution of D-valine in the culture media. No prolactin was detected in the D-valine-treated gland cultures. Stromal cell cultures demonstrated increasing prolactin with continuous incubation with progesterone (15-day control: 11.28 +/- 0.91 ng/100 micrograms deoxyribonucleic acid versus 15-day progesterone: 245.8 +/- 4.24 ng/100 micrograms). Prolactin levels increased after progesterone was removed at day 4 and 8, reaching peak production 4 days later, followed by a steady decline. Estradiol induced a sustained increase in prolactin production even after withdrawal of steroids. Aromatase activity in gland cells exposed to steroids exhibited no change with time. Steroid-treated stromal cell cultures showed an increase in aromatase activity in all 15-day (controls: 21.6 +/- 0.7 pmol substrate converted per mg of deoxyribonucleic acid per 24 hours versus progesterone: 43.4 +/- 4.2 versus estradiol: 34.2 +/- 3.5 versus progesterone and estradiol: 47.5 +/- 2.4) but not in 4- or 8-day incubations. These studies support these conclusions: (1) nongestational endometrial prolactin is of stromal, not glandular origin; (2) stromal prolactin production is induced and maintained by progesterone: (3) stromal prolactin production is induced by estradiol but does not require continued exposure for maintenance; (4) aromatase activity is increased by long-term exposure to progesterone and estradiol in stroma but not in glands.\r"

Vasopressin was infused at rates ranging from 1 to 300 ng/min/kg estimated fetal mass. This range of infusion rates produces plasma arginine vasopressin levels observed throughout a wide range of fetal stress. No maternal effects were observed at any infusion rates used in this investigation. Fetal heart rate declined linearly with the log of the infusion rate. Mean fetal arterial pressure showed a sigmoidal response to log arginine vasopressin infusion rate, reaching a plateau at 30 ng/min/kg. Umbilical vascular resistance increased throughout the entire range of infusion rates. Fetoplacental blood flow decreased with increasing infusion rate but decreased only 4% to 13% throughout the range of infusion rates that produce plasma arginine vasopressin levels commonly observed during fetal stress. Because umbilical vascular resistance continued to rise after arterial pressure reached a plateau, fetoplacental blood flow decreased 31% at the highest infusion rate. However, the plasma vasopressin level associated with this infusion rate is probably in excess of that associated with severe fetal distress. The fetoplacental vascular bed is, therefore, either relatively insensitive to arginine vasopressin, or is capable of autoregulation in the face of high circulating levels of arginine vasopressin.\r"

Heterogeneous expression of most antigens was observed within a given tumor nodule, but in each patient the proportion of cells expressing an antigen was similar in the primary tumor and metastases. To explore the stability of the antigenic phenotype of individual cells, we studied CA 125 expression in an ovarian cancer cell line. Cells were separated into CA 125-positive and -negative groups using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. After the two groups of cells were recultured separately, only 38% of cells originally sorted as CA 125 positive still expressed CA 125, whereas 27% of cells sorted as CA 125 negative expressed CA 125. That cells may gain or lose CA 125 expression in culture suggests that expression of CA 125 by ovarian cancer cells is not a stable trait.\r"

  ".W": "We previously showed that combined treatment with tamoxifen and progestin was effective in arresting the growth of human endometrial carcinomas in the nude mouse model. After a 15- to 20-week tumoristatic period, the tumors began to regrow, reminiscent of the clinical situation. Lack of progestin sensitivity during the regrowth period appeared to reflect the absence of progesterone receptor. To test the prediction that intermittent progestin administration may circumvent the regrowth phenomenon, the effect of various doses of progestin on blood progestin levels, EnCa 101 tumor progesterone receptor profiles, and rate of tumor growth were examined. Whereas 1 mg progestin was ineffective in totally down-regulating tumor progesterone receptor, 2 and 5 mg doses resulted in the total disappearance of tumor progesterone receptor by 1 week followed by its reappearance at 5 to 6 weeks and 9 to 10 weeks, respectively. On the basis of these results we predict that intermittent progestin administration may result in better control of endometrial cancer growth in the nude mouse system.\r"

Luteal phase inadequacy was diagnosed when the late luteal endometrial biopsy pattern was greater than 2 days out of phase in two cycles; in patients treated with clomiphene citrate therapy was changed if one biopsy was out of phase. One hundred ninety-seven patients underwent 242 biopsies. Among 137 women no treated with clomiphene citrate, 24 (17.5%) had out-of-phase biopsy specimens; 7 of 24 (29.2%) repeat biopsies were out of phase, with luteal phase inadequacy in 7 of 137 (5.1%) women. The probability of an out-of-phase biopsy occurring by chance alone was 4.2 of 137 or 3.1%. No woman was diagnosed to have luteal phase inadequacy as the single infertility factor. Fifty-three pregnancies (41%) occurred in 130 women without luteal phase inadequacy and in 2 of 7 (28.6%) diagnosed to have luteal phase inadequacy with other infertility factors. In clomiphene citrate-treated patients, pregnancy occurred in 15 of 26 (57.7%) with corrected luteal phase inadequacy and in 21 of 34 (61.8%) without luteal phase inadequacy. In this population the diagnosis of luteal phase inadequacy was not made more frequently than by chance alone. Moreover, fecundity in patients with treated luteal phase inadequacy is comparable to that in patients without this diagnosis.\r"

Assessment included history, physical and functional examinations, and urodynamic and severity evaluations. Patients were 67 +/- 8 years old, mentally and functionally intact, predominantly white, and of middle-to-upper socioeconomic strata. Specific urodynamic criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of sphincteric incompetence and detrusor instability. Fifteen (10%) did not fulfill either criteria, 90 (62%) had sphincteric incompetence, 17 (12%) had detrusor instability, and 23 (16%) had both. Detrusor and urethral function variables showed some impairment in all patients. Impairment was least in subjects without demonstrable diagnosis and worst in those with both disorders (p less than 0.01). The findings suggest that detrusor and urethral functions are impaired in all incontinent women and that the degree of impairment varies. The impairment seems worse when both urodynamic diagnoses are demonstrable. The data support the pathophysiologic association of urethral and detrusor dysfunctions.\r"

However, the exact incidence of leiomyosarcoma in uteri removed with a preoperative diagnosis of benign uterine leiomyomas has not been previously reported. Between 1983 and 1988, a total of 1432 patients in Women's Hospital, a self-referred indigent population, had a hysterectomy planned because of abnormal uterine bleeding or abdominal pain associated with the presence of uterine leiomyomas, or because of a pelvic mass thought to be uterine leiomyoma of sufficient size or character to warrant surgical exploration. The ages of these women ranged from 36 to 62 years and the presence of leiomyosarcoma in the hysterectomy specimens increased steadily from the fourth to seventh decades of age (0.2%, 0.9%, 1.4%, and 1.7%, respectively). Preoperative histologic examination of the endometrium was performed in eight patients. Three of the eight patients had a preoperative tissue diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma that was clinically confined to the uterus. After the hysterectomy in the 1429 patients with presumed benign disease, histologic diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was made in seven (0.49%). There was no evidence of malignancy in the endometrial sampling of any of these seven patients and the diagnosis was suspected intraoperatively in only three. Preoperative uterine size ranged from 8 to 20 weeks' gestational size and postoperative uterine weight ranged from 120 to 1100 gm. Seven of the 10 patients had symptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding. Between the ages of 40 and 60 years, 1% (8 of 817) of women with presumed uterine leiomyomas producing symptoms that necessitated hysterectomy in this series had leiomyosarcoma diagnosis postoperatively. Such treatments as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, endometrial ablation, myomectomy by hysteroscopy or laparotomy instead of hysterectomy in such women could delay the diagnosis and definitive treatment of leiomyosarcoma.\r"

Of 213 deaths, 45 (21%) were due to air, blood clot, or amniotic fluid embolism. The risk of embolism death was higher among minority women and older women (34 to 44 years). Our analysis revealed that curettage at less than or equal to 21 weeks and abortions at less than or equal to 12 weeks, regardless of method, were both associated with the least risk of embolism death. In comparing 1972 to 1978 and 1979 to 1985, we found that the embolism mortality rate decreased 79%. During 1979 to 1985, the number of abortions performed by noncurettage methods decreased 58%, possibly as a result of earlier abortion morbidity studies, which showed that these methods carried a greater risk of complications. Although a decrease in mortality rates may be partially attributable to the declining use of these methods, our analysis suggests that changes in methods over time have not been universally applied to all racial groups.\r"

Considering the prevalence of diethylstilbestrol exposure in the general population, the relative risks of vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma for in utero exposure were 365.6 and 459.0 when vaginal bleeding did and did not occur during the index pregnancy, respectively. The relative risks of vaginal adenosis for such diethylstilbestrol exposure were 15.4 and 92.8, respectively, for these women. The strong associations between in utero diethylstilbestrol exposure and both vaginal adenosis and genital tract clear cell adenocarcinoma cannot be attributed to the occurrence of problem pregnancy. However, among daughters exposed to diethylstilbestrol, maternal vaginal bleeding during the index pregnancy does appear to be associated with reduced risks of vaginal adenosis and vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma.\r"

Potential mechanisms of action include (1) the induction of peroxisomal proliferation and (2) the conversion of DHA to androgens. We evaluated the immune system of mice fed DHA. Dietary DHA had no significant effect on antibody responses, cutaneous sensitivity reactions, natural killer activity, or graft-versus-host reactions. However, a decrease in lymphoid organ cellularity and an absence of splenic germinal centers were observed. We assessed progenitor cell activity in irradiated mice by evaluating the repopulation of marrow and lymphoid organs. Dehydroisoandrosterone feeding resulted in an inhibition of lymphopoiesis but not myelopoiesis. Clofibrate, another peroxisomal proliferator, failed to inhibit lymphocyte repopulation after irradiation. Androgen-non-responsive Tfm/Y mice were as susceptible as control mice to the inhibitory effects of DHA on lymphopoiesis. Thus DHA itself may act on lymphoid progenitor cells and/or the microenvironment.\r"

By contrast, SOD-free liposomes, free SOD, or heat-denatured LSOD had no protective effect. Liposome-encapsulated SOD did not simply delay the onset of liver necrosis. A second dose of LSOD at 12 hours prevented the necrosis of the liver as assessed 24 hours after treatment with 500 mg/kg body weight of acetaminophen. Liposome-encapsulated human recombinant superoxide dismutase did not alter the metabolism of acetaminophen as assessed by either the rate or extent of the depletion of hepatic stores of glutathione or by the extent of the covalent binding of the metabolites of [3H]acetaminophen to total liver cell proteins. Evidence of the peroxidation of lipids in the accumulation of malondialdehyde in the livers was detected within 3 hours of the administration of acetaminophen and before the appearance of liver necrosis. Liposome-encapsulated human recombinant superoxide dismutase prevented the accumulation of malondialdehyde in parallel with the prevention of liver necrosis. Finally, LSOD also prevented the potentiation by 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea of the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen. These data document the participation of superoxide anions in the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen in intact rats.\r"

Fewer cells with viral transcripts were seen in noninflamed tissues. Viral RNA was identified in macrophagelike cells in lung, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, in cells lining the vessels of brain and synovium, and in epithelial cells of intestinal crypts, renal tubules, and thyroid follicles.

Morphometric analysis of 3477 villous profiles showed that 5.5% of villi examined had fibrin deposition at sites of syncytial denudation and that fibrin deposition was highly associated with villous epithelial denudation, as evidenced by loss of cytokeratin staining. The perivillous fibrin deposits were strongly immunoreactive for the B beta chain of fibrin II, consistent with local thrombolytic cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin. Deposits were frequently surfaced by a discontinuous layer of cytokeratin-positive trophoblastic cells that showed type IV basement membrane collagen immunoreactivity at the interface between trophoblast and fibrin. Ultrastructurally, damage to the syncytial trophoblast was apparent at the edge of some deposits, where syncytial denudation was accompanied by a fibrin coating of residual cellular trophoblast and the trophoblastic basal lamina. Other deposits were surfaced by syncytial trophoblast with underlying cellular trophoblast and a new basal lamina external to the basal lamina of the villous core. Cultured cellular trophoblast grown on a fibrin matrix, but not on uncoated plastic, showed morphologic differentiation into a trophoblast layer like that on term villi. The authors suggest that epithelialization of perivillous fibrin deposits is a form of villous repair and that trophoblast-fibrin interactions can modulate trophoblastic differentiation.\r"

To gain a deeper insight into the function of the compound, the authors have now studied its influence on the sequential development of the joint changes and the associated lesions in spleen and liver. Bis(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)methane is shown to block acute synovitis, to retard and reduce granuloma formation in spleen and liver, to decrease neutrophilic leukocytosis, and to diminish hemopoietic hyperplasia in the bone, and thus also to mitigate the distinctive osteoclastic and chondroclastic events.

The inflammatory response is characterized by increased lavage cell recoveries, principally macrophages and neutrophils. Lavage recoveries of protein, nonpolar lipid, phospholipid, and saturated phosphatidylcholine also are increased. The recovery ratio for two important surfactant phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol, is decreased at all points following exposure. Our morphologic analyses, together with results correlating lavage cell and lipid recoveries, point to the potential importance of macrophages and neutrophils in the epithelial cell response to cristobalite exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MoMuSV349) is produced by MuSV349 cells in at least eight-fold excess over the replication-competent helper virus. Less than 48-hours-old Balb/c mice inoculated intraperitoneally with supernatant from MuSV349 cells containing approximately 10(4) MuSV349 infectious units developed clinical symptoms, including severe generalized wasting, 15 to 20 days after inoculation. These infected mice became moribund 35 to 45 days after inoculation. Gross examination of the bodies revealed the presence of cutaneous and subcutaneous 0.2-cm to 1.5-cm macules, plaques, or nodules located predominantly on the ventral abdomen and legs. Nodules also were found in the spleen, liver, ovaries, testes, meninges, nerves, and skin. The nodules were semisoft, cystic, or solid and some expressed variable amounts of blood. Histologic examination of the macules, plaques, and nodules showed spindlelike cells intermingled with tortous, jagged vascular channels lined by plump and normal endothelial cells and unlined slitlike spaces filled with erythrocytes. These angiomatous lesions were infiltrated extensively with neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and some plasma cells. In some cases the lesions also included foci of densely packed eosinophils. These angiomatous lesions are clearly distinguishable from the fibrosarcomas induced by the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV), and resemble the sarcomas induced in mice by Gz-MSV and Balb MSV, the sarcomas induced in rats by MPSV and Ha-MSV, and the acute generalized form of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. Electron microscopy also revealed the presence of numerous extracellular type C virions and virions budding from the plasma membrane of endothelial and spindlelike cells. Erythrophagocytosis by the endothelial and spindlelike cells was demonstrated by light and electron microscopy. The widely disseminated lesions appear to have developed simultaneously as a consequence of viremia rather than metastasis.\r"

  ".W": "Exogenously administered tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and bacterial endotoxin (LPS) induce shock and tissue injury. Here, the authors studied the effect of endogenous TNF on LPS-induced hypotension and tissue injury and investigated the role of PAF in these responses. Rats were primed with intraperitoneal injection of zymosan 24 hours before, or Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) 12 to 15 days before intravenous injection of low dose (0.5 mg/kg) LPS. It was found that nonprimed animals showed mild hypotension and moderate leukopenia in response to LPS. In contrast, zymosanprimed rats developed shock and marked leukopenia, and more severe bowel injury than nonprimed rats. The authors then showed that, following LPS injection, zymosan-primed animals had higher TNF and platelet-activating factor (PAF) levels than nonprimed rats. Pretreatment of the animal with PAF antagonist, SRI 63-441, markedly ameliorated the hypotension and tissue injury. Interestingly, BCG-primed rats did not show aggravation of LPS-induced hypotension. Only TNF (but not PAF) level in these animals was increased. Thus, it appears that TNF release alone, without a sufficient increase in PAF, is incapable of causing severe hypotension. However, most of the BCG-primed animals showed tissue injury, which could be prevented by pretreatment with PAF antagonist. The authors discuss the possible mechanisms of this discrepancy between systemic and local responses in BCG-primed animals.\r"

  ".U": "90225100\r", 
  ".W": "Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) are benign self-healing cutaneous eruptions that may be clinically and histologically similar. However LyP has a 5% to 20% risk of associated lymphoid malignancy, whereas PLEVA does not. To determine whether the immunophenotype of lymphoid cells is useful in the distinction of these two disorders, the pattern of expression of lymphoid cell lineage and activation antigens in nine cases of LyP and seven cases of PLEVA were compared. In all cases of LyP most larger cells expressed the activation antigen Ki-1 (CD30) and lacked expression of the T-cell antigen CD7 and at least one other T-cell antigen (CD2, CD3, CD5). In contrast, CD30-antigen expression was rare or absent in PLEVA, CD3- and CD7-antigen expression was found in all cases, and diminished expression of T-cell antigens (CD2 and CD5) was seen in only one case. Diffuse expression of HLA-DR antigen by epidermal keratinocytes was found in a greater proportion of PLEVA cases (6 of 7) than LyP cases (3 of 6). In addition, CD8+ cells predominated at the dermal/epidermal junction in 3 of 6 cases of PLEVA but in only 1 of 7 cases of LyP. We conclude that LyP and PLEVA can be distinguished immunohistochemically in most, if not all, cases. Furthermore these results suggest that LyP and PLEVA are separate disorders, thus accounting for their variable prognoses.\r"

In this family study of depression, direct interviews with 380 subjects combined with relatives' reports revealed a similar inverse relationship between defensiveness and lifetime prevalence of any psychiatric disorder, especially when diagnostic status was most certain and among those at greater risk for psychopathology.

  ".W": "We evaluated a program for improving influenza immunization performance in a health maintenance organization (HMO). The HMO implemented several interventions successively from 1984-87: a postcard reminder to members at high risk for complications of influenza, a computer-generated reminder to the physician at the time of any primary care visit by high-risk patients, performance feedback to chiefs of service, and, finally, retrospective feedback to each physician comparing his/her performance with that of the other physicians. We examined immunization rates for a group of members older than age 65, a high-risk group under age 65, and a group of diabetic members who had not been subject to the reminders (vs a group who had been covered by the program). Vaccination rates were increased in those diabetic members who received reminders. Nevertheless, among members younger and older than age 65 whose experience was observed over three flu seasons, a significant increase in vaccination rates was not achieved until physician feedback was added to the program. We conclude that each element of the reminder and feedback program has contributed to the overall increase in vaccination rates at the HMO and that effective ongoing influenza immunization programs can be implemented in practice settings with appropriate systems support.\r"

  ".U": "90225178\r", 
  ".W": "Excise elasticities of demand for non-cigarette tobacco and cigarettes were calculated for Papua New Guinea for the 14 years 1973-86. Respectively, these were -0.50 and -0.71. This means that 10 percent increases in cigarette and non-cigarette tobacco excise are associated with an estimated 7.1 percent fall in demand for cigarettes and a 5 percent decrease in the demand for tobacco. As tax (excise) elasticities would normally be significantly smaller than price elasticities, these results imply that the consumption of cigarettes and tobacco in Papua New Guinea are more responsive to prices than in the United States and other Western countries. The level of excise is therefore an important and practical instrument for the control of consumption. These elasticities appear to be the first reported for a developing country. It is suggested that if they are indicative of consumer behavior in lower income countries then increasing tobacco and cigarette excise should be considered as an important strategy for the control of smoking in these countries which, because of their large populations, are huge markets for tobacco products and thus major targets for tobacco control measures.\r"

Estimates are based on the 1986 Linked Telephone Survey that reinterviewed 1,550 White women 20-44 years of age who were respondents to the 1985 National Health Interview Survey. An estimated 39 percent of White women who had smoked before pregnancy quit smoking while pregnant (27 percent when they found out they were pregnant and 12 percent later during pregnancy). Women with less than 12 years of education were five times as likely to smoke and one-fourth as likely to quit as those with 16 or more years of education. Women who smoked more than one pack of cigarettes per day before pregnancy were one-fifth as likely to quit as those smoking less. Of the women who quit, 70 percent resumed smoking within one year of delivery. Of those who relapsed, 67 percent resumed smoking within three months of delivery and 93 percent within six months. There is little evidence of educational differentials in relapse rates. The fact that relapse remains high suggests that while health of the fetus is a strong influence on women's smoking habits, women may be less aware of the effect of passive smoke on the infant.\r"

Three-month follow-up results favored the laboratory method over the two public service approaches on both a prevalence and a sustained abstinence measure. At one-year follow-up, treatment effects for smoking prevalence were no longer significant. However, sustained abstinence results at one-year remained highly significant and favored the more intensive laboratory and Freedom from Smoking clinics over the FreshStart method. FreshStart fared less well than the other interventions both in producing initial quit attempts and in sustaining abstinence among initial quitters. It should be noted, however, that FreshStart requires considerably less facilitator contact than do the other approaches. Unexpected outcome effects occurred for treatment location. Future clinic programs should include a specific target date for quitting and should place more emphasis upon recycling participants who fail to sustain abstinence.\r"

Results with reference cigarettes were consistent with published values, providing support for the methodology employed. The emissions of benzene and BaP, expressed as mass emitted per gram of tobacco consumed, were similar for all products evaluated; for benzene, the mean values for cigars, RYO cigarette and pipe tobaccos were 156 +/- 52, 68 +/- 11, and 242 +/- 126 micrograms/g, respectively. Mean values for BaP were 42 +/- 7 and 48 +/- 4 ng/g for cigars and RYO cigarette tobacco, respectively. Lead values were below the limit of reliable quantitation in all cases. The mean benzene concentrations in a puff ranged from 1 to 2 x 10(5) micrograms/m3 for cigars, RYO cigarette and pipe tobaccos. For BaP, the puff concentration averaged about 60 micrograms/m3 for cigars and RYO cigarette tobacco. The results suggest that smoking cigars, pipes or RYO cigarettes leads to potential exposures which exceed the No Significant Risk levels of benzene and BaP set pursuant to California's Proposition 65. These tobacco products are now required to bear a health hazard warning when sold in California. We recommend that this be adopted as national policy.\r"

An intense effort was made to ensure that antismoking activities were maximized at the school, organizational, and community level. Smoking prevalences in both cities from 1981 were fitted with a statistical model to identify any underlying trend, to assess any immediate impact, and to assess the longer term effect of continuing to conduct such campaigns, i.e. to identify any change in the underlying trend. During the years before the antismoking campaigns, there was no observable trend in smoking prevalence in either city. At the beginning of the campaigns, there was an immediate drop of more than two percentage points in male and female smoking prevalence in both cities. Thereafter, a decline of about 1.5 percentage points per year was observed among males. No post campaign trend was observed in smoking prevalence for women in either city. These data support conducting coordinated community campaigns to reduce current smoking prevalence.\r"

Data on alcohol drinking were collected in 1987 by mail and telephone interview. The alcohol drinking measures include three indicators of abstention (lifetime abstainer, lifetime non-regular drinker, and current abstainer) and two indicators of consumption (average daily ethanol consumption and high consumption). In unadjusted and co-twin adjusted analyses, neither service in Southeast Asia nor combat exposure was significantly associated with any measure of abstention. In the co-twin adjusted analysis, there was no association of Southeast Asia service and combat exposure with average daily ethanol consumption. After adjustment for co-twin effects, 4.0 percent of non-Southeast Asia veterans were high consumers compared to 6.7 percent of Southeast Asia veterans who served in high combat. We conclude that prior military service in a war zone has a relatively modest long-term effect on the alcohol drinking patterns of male veterans.\r"

Seven percent (n = 92) of women reported physical or sexual violence during pregnancy. Most of the women (94 percent) knew their assailant. Victims of violence were at greater risk of having a history of depression and attempted suicide, having more current depressive symptoms, reporting less happiness about being pregnant, and receiving less emotional support from others for the current pregnancy. Comparisons of victims and non-victims showed that victims were more likely to be users of alcohol and drugs. In addition, partners of victims were more likely to use marijuana and cocaine. When possible confounders were controlled using multivariable analyses, a woman's alcohol use during pregnancy and her partner's drug use were independently associated with an increased risk of being a victim of violence during pregnancy. Results of this study highlight the importance of assessing exposure to violence during prenatal care, especially among women who are heavy users of alcohol or drugs or whose partners use these substances.\r"

Overall, 17 percent of adults had been tested; of these, 73 percent because of blood donation, 14 percent through other non-voluntary programs (such as military induction), and 16 percent sought testing voluntarily. While a smaller proportion of Black and Hispanic adults had been tested, they were more likely than their White non-Hispanic counterparts to have been tested voluntarily. Persons who reported belonging to groups with high-risk behaviors were also more likely to have been voluntarily tested. Most of those tested voluntarily received their test results, but only one-third also received prevention information. Three percent of adults plan to be tested voluntarily in the next year; about half will seek testing through their doctor or health maintenance organization.\r"

We also determined exposure by quantifying the average CO level in the rink during the games. Other variables documented included age, pulmonary function, aerobic capacity, and smoking status. Environmental concentrations varied from 1.6 to 131.5 parts per million (ppm). We examined the absorption/exposure relationship using a simple linear regression model. In low CO exposure levels, physical exercise lowered the alveolar CO concentration. However, we noted that for each 10 ppm of CO in the ambient air, the players had adsorbed enough CO to raise their carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels by 1 percent. This relationship was true both for smokers and non-smokers. We suggest that an average environmental concentration of 20 ppm of CO for the duration of a hockey game (90 minutes) should be reference limit not to be exceeded in indoor skating rinks.\r"

We sought to evaluate the relative importance of surface forces to elastic recoil by comparing the differences between the air and saline pressure-volume curves. The difference in elastic recoil between air- and saline-filled lungs was altered in bleomycin-treated rats when elastic recoil was compared at 35% of predicted TLC or at 80% of observed TLC. This pressure difference was present both during the early phase (Days 4 and 7) of the injury and acute inflammation as well as during the later phase (Days 14 to 28) when there was chronic inflammation and an elevation in the lung hydroxyproline content. The total amount of phospholipids recovered in lavage was decreased at Day 4 and increased more than 2.5-fold over saline-instilled control animals at Days 21 and 28. The percentage of phosphatidylglycerol was reduced and that of phosphatidylinositol increased. There was no consistent change in the percentage of phosphatidylcholine that was disaturated. The amount of surfactant protein A (SP-A) did not change during the course of the experiment and was not a useful independent marker of alveolar injury or changes in pulmonary compliance. The ratio of SP-A to total phospholipid decreased 14 to 28 days after instillation of bleomycin. These results support the hypothesis that individual components of surfactant are independently regulated and indicate that SP-A content in lavage is insensitive to lung injury and repair.\r"

Paired experiments with OA were performed in 10 sheep, 5 of which received Exosurf in the first experiment and aerosolized 0.9% NaCl in the second; in the other 5 sheep the order of Exosurf and NaCl was reversed. Paired experiments without OA were performed in 6 additional sheep that served as controls. In the first set of experiments, OA caused significant abnormalities, compared to control and baseline values (p less than 0.02), in Crs, RT, and PO2; there was no difference between animals that received Exosurf and those that received NaCl. Baseline values for PO2 and Crs during the second set of experiments with OA were lower than controls (p less than 0.002), indicating that the animals had not fully recovered from their initial injury. After OA, the animals that received NaCl (i.e., the ones that received Exosurf the first time) had higher PO2 and Crs values (p less than 0.01) than those that received NaCl first and Exosurf second. There was no difference in postmortem lung water content between the animals that received Exosurf or NaCl first, both of which were higher than control (p less than 0.01). Studies in 3 additional sheep showed peripheral deposition of aerosol. Thus, we failed to show an acutely beneficial effect of aerosolized Exosurf in OA-induced lung injury; Exosurf did, however, appear to provide protection against some of the consequences of repeated lung injury.\r"

  ".W": "In lung sarcoidosis, the mutual relationships of three components of the extracellular matrix, fibronectin (FN), hyaluronan (HA), and type III procollagen peptide (PCP), were investigated in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Furthermore, their relation to signs of alveolitis and of fibrosis was examined. Sarcoidosis patients (n = 74) had significantly (p less than 0.001) increased BAL fluid concentrations of FN, HA, and PCP, as well as albumin and lymphocytes, compared to controls (n = 57). The increases were significantly higher in clinically active than in inactive sarcoidosis. FN, HA, and PCP were significantly correlated to markers of alveolitis, such as albumin (r approximately 0.6-0.7; p less than 0.001) and lymphocytes (r approximately 0.4-0.5; p less than 0.001 for FN and HA; p less than 0.05 for PCP), indicating that an alveolar inflammatory process may be a prerequisite for the increased production of the three components. Since correlations between FN and HA and functional parameters (VC, TLC, FEV1.0, and DLCO) were low (r approximately 0.2-0.3, p less than 0.05-0.01 for FN and HA), the increased levels of the extracellular markers do not seem to reflect developed fibrosis. The three markers of extracellular matrix showed significant (p less than 0.001) mutual correlations in the sarcoid patients (r approximately 0.7). FN and HA were correlated even in controls (r = 0.5; p less than 0.01). The findings are in agreement with our hypothesis that these compounds may participate in the buildup of an extracellular network that supports the healing process but in excess may eventually lead to fibrosis.\r"

Except for the test FIO2 (0.18), the study essentially followed the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Community for Coal and Steel (ECCS) recommendations for standardizing the methodology of measuring DLCO. Prediction equations for ages 20 through 70 were calculated separately for both sexes. Simple linear equations using age, height, and body weight as independent variables predicted the DLCO indices (DLCO, VA, and DL/VA) as well as more complex equations. In addition, a complete analysis of the residuals (predicted measured values) showed that the assumptions of the multiple regression analysis (independence, homoscedasticity and Gaussian distribution of residuals) were fulfilled using simple linear equations. Correction for the instrumental and anatomic dead spaces decreased the DLCO an average of 4.7%. The standard error of estimates was lower than those reported from other series in the literature. The predicted values from this study were lower than those reported by some investigators and were in reasonable agreement with other studies. A portion but not all of the differences could be explained on the basis of recognized differences in testing methodology. The results of this study may be of value to clinical laboratories seeking predictive equations for DLCO most appropriate for their testing methodology and patient population, and may assist in the resolution of some controversies regarding differences among predictive equations for DLCO.\r"

Percent predicted DLCOsb and its correction for alveolar volume (DL/VA) were significantly lower in smokers than in nonsmokers. The relationship of presence/absence of respiratory symptoms and cigarette smoking with DLCOsb and DL/VA was significant. DLCO indices were almost always selected as discriminant variables in multivariate analysis between asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. Poor concordance among lung function tests was evident: in men, 30% with abnormal (i.e., lower than 97.5% percentile) and 21% with normal DLCO indices also had abnormal MEFV parameters and/or DN2%/L. In women, the corresponding figures were 24 and 10%, respectively. In men, when considering only DLCO indices, the percentage of symptomatic subjects with abnormal lung function tests ranged from 33% in those with at least one symptom to 45% in those complaining of dyspnea. When the proportion of symptomatic subjects with DN2%/L and MEFV abnormalities were added, it increased to 56 and 66%, respectively. However, in women the proportion of symptomatic subjects with abnormal lung function indices was very small. These results indicate the usefulness of including CO diffusing capacity in epidemiologic surveys in the detection of abnormalities.\r"

The viscoelastic properties, frog palate transport rate, and percent solid composition were in the normal range reported for both canine and human mucus collected using the bronchoscopy brush technique. There were no significant differences noted between male and female patients, and there were no changes in mucus or transport properties seen with aging. Mucus was also collected separately from the inside of the tube exposed to constant gas flow (13 patients), and from the outside of the endotracheal tubes in 25 patients. Although there were no significant differences in viscoelastic properties between inside and outside mucus, there was a greater thread formation (filance, 45 versus 26 mm; p less than 0.005) and a higher percentage of solids in mucus from the inside of the endotracheal tube (15.9 versus 11.4%; p less than 0.05), which is compatible with reduced hydration. The duration of anesthesia ranged from 25 to 195 min (mean, 85 min). There was no effect of duration of anesthesia on any of the measured mucus properties. This technique for mucus collection allows us to study alterations in mucus properties in patients with and without pulmonary disease at the time of incidental surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Repeated measurements of nasal cavity volumes by a new method, acoustic rhinometry, showed characteristic patterns ranging from marked increases in volumes lasting the entire exposure period to transient monophasic or biphasic responses to no change at all. The pattern in individual subjects was reproducible with the two methods of cooling, and it could be characterized by five types when related to baseline measurements during the preexposure period. Because of large minute-to-minute variations, probably determined by local differences and fluctuations in blood flow in tissues through the nose, evaluation of induced changes in the nasal cavity volume cannot be based on single measurements as has frequently been done in the past by using rhinomanometry as the experimental method. The mechanisms behind the characteristic patterns in immediate human nasal response to local skin cooling challenge remains to be explored.\r"

It also examines prospective results of a general population, 16 to 69 yr of age, who had less than 6 mm of induration at first PPD test. This population received a second PPD test between 1976 and 1986. In about 95% of cases, the interval was 1 to 5 yr. In 1,355 bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-vaccinated subjects, none of the criteria is acceptable for true conversion. Among 1,834 nonvaccinated BCG, only the criterion of a change from less than 10 to 18 mm or more with an increase of 12 mm or more, or the criterion of change from less than 10 to 18 mm or more with an increase of 18 mm or more, is compatible with true conversion and with the correspondent annual risk of infection. But we must accept that with smaller increases, recently infected persons may escape diagnosis of infection. A third test was performed in 81 subjects with two negative test results. In all cases except one, the annual conversion rate observed was much higher than the annual risk of infection. These data reveal shortcomings of the current criterion for conversion. They show that the tuberculin conversion at retesting is not epidemiologically related to new infection and that none of the criteria assures the discovery of true converters. Other factors must be taken into account.\r"

We have measured alveolar deposition and large airway-related side effects (e.g., cough, breathlessness, and effect on pulmonary function) after aerosolization of 150 mg pentamidine isethionate labeled with 99mTc-Sn-colloid. Nine patients with AIDS were studied using three nebulizer systems producing different droplet size profiles: the Acorn System 22, Respirgard II, and Respirgard II with the inspiratory baffle removed. Alveolar deposition was greatest and side effects least with the nebulizer producing the smallest droplet size profile (Respirgard II), whereas large airway-related side effects were prominent and alveolar deposition lowest with the nebulizer producing the largest droplet size (Acorn System 22). Values for alveolar deposition and adverse airway effects were intermediate using the Respirgard with inspiratory baffle removed, thus indicating the importance of the baffle valve in determining droplet size. Addition of a similar baffle valve to the Acorn System 22 produced a marked improvement in droplet size profile. Selection of a nebulizer that produces an optimal droplet size range offers the advantage of enhancing alveolar targeting of aerosolized pentamidine while reducing large airway-related side effects.\r"

Fragments (1 x 2 mm) of epithelium with adherent submucosa from nasal polyps, adenoids, or nasal turbinates were cultured in plastic dishes with media containing a serum supplement. Within a week a monolayer of epithelial cells with interspersed ciliated cells surrounded each fragment. Epithelial monolayers were exposed to 10(3) to 10(4) TCID50/ml of each virus; unattached virus was removed after 3 h. Replication of virus was examined by doing viral titrations of the media daily, and ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells in the monolayer were examined morphologically with an inverted microscope. The peak titer of rhinovirus and coronavirus occurred 24 to 48 h after inoculation, indicating that viral replication was occurring. However, no detectable damage or cytopathic effect (CPE) developed in the monolayer of epithelial cells when compared with that in uninfected control cells. In contrast, infection of epithelial monolayers with influenza or adenovirus resulted in CPE and destruction of the monolayer. The marked difference in the effect of these respiratory viruses on nasal epithelial cells may reflect similar differences in their effect on respiratory tract mucosa in the intact host. If so, the pathogenesis of symptom production during rhinovirus and coronavirus infections must be by mechanisms other than destruction of the nasal lining.\r"

  ".W": "To assess maturational changes in collagen synthesis, lung tissue was obtained from healthy Macaca nemestrina monkeys at different ages, ranging from 68% of term gestation to adulthood. We hypothesized that infants delivered prematurely have a greater rate of collagen synthesis than do older animals because of their greater rate of lung growth during gestation. Secondly, we hypothesized that lung repair in infants with hyaline membrane disease (HMD) is associated with an additional increase in lung collagen synthesis rate. Therefore, lung tissue was obtained during the first week of life from monkeys delivered at 82% of term gestation, a stage at which half of them developed HMD. The rate of total protein synthesis in lung samples was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]proline; the rate of collagen synthesis was determined by measuring the conversion of proline into hydroxyproline. Premature monkeys had a higher rate of collagen synthesis (9.9 +/- 2.7 nmol/mg DNA/h) than did term infants (5.3 +/- 1.1) or older animals (2.1 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.05). There was no additional increase in rate of collagen synthesis in animals with HMD from 3 h (14.3 +/- 6.9) to 7 days of age (15.1 +/- 6.1); control premature animals also had no significant change during the first week of life (10.9 +/- 3.0 at 3 h; 11.6 +/- 4.6 at 7 days). The early stage of recovery from HMD in premature monkeys does not appear to be associated with an increase in collagen production beyond the already increased synthesis rate associated with lung growth.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigations have demonstrated an inverse relationship between lung volume and airway resistance in awake humans. We wished to examine this relationship in the absence of conscious influences. We therefore studied eight healthy subjects who slept in a tank respirator. Hyperinflation was induced by continuous negative tank pressure while the subjects breathed spontaneously. Ventilation, pulmonary resistance (total pulmonary resistance, seven subjects; upper airway resistance, one subject), diaphragm and genioglossus electromyograms (EMGs), and sleep state were measured. During control NREM sleep, group mean maximal pulmonary resistance was 42.5 cm H2O/L/s (range, 17.4 to 106.4 cm H2O/L/s). During steady-state hyperinflation (mean increase in lung volume = 0.53 L), pulmonary resistance decreased 40% (range, -3 to -90%). Ventilation, sleep state, and end-tidal CO2 were unchanged. Inspiratory muscle EMG was increased in two of two subjects during hyperinflation. Genioglossus EMG was characterized by phasic and tonic activity during the control period in two of two subjects. Both components were decreased during steady-state hyperinflation. When lung volume was returned to baseline, pulmonary resistance and genioglossus EMG increased to baseline levels. We conclude that alteration in lung volume within the tidal volume range significantly alters pulmonary resistance during NREM sleep. This influence occurs independent of chemical stimuli or genioglossal muscle activity, and may be related to traction on neck structures caused by descent of mediastinal structures.\r"

They were referred for evaluation of presumptive sleep apnea syndrome on the basis of history and physical examination, but were found to have predominantly CSR on all-night sleep study. On the initial polysomnographic study, CSR comprised 47 to 86% of all disordered-breathing events. Cheyne-Stokes respiration resulted in considerable oxyhemoglobin desaturation (mean baseline saturation was 95 +/- 4 +/- SD, and lowest saturation was 76 +/- 8). More than one-half of all CSR events resulted in awakenings or arousals. Evidence of upper airway obstruction was noted in the majority of CSR events in three of five patients. Four patients were treated with theophylline; one who refused drug therapy was treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Comparison of sleep studies before and after therapy showed a significant decrease in the CSR index (29 +/- 11 versus 2 +/- 2) and in the maximal oxyhemoglobin desaturation associated with CSR (13 +/- 5 versus 3 +/- 2), and an improvement in lowest O2 saturation associated with CSR (76 +/- 8 versus 91 +/- 4). Total disruptions in sleep architecture per hour of sleep improved significantly with therapy (46 +/- 21 versus 20 +/- 8). We conclude that the clinical presentation of CSR can be indistinguishable from that of the \"traditional\" sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome and can result in major oxyhemoglobin desaturation and sleep fragmentation. Theophylline results in considerable improvement in the disordered breathing of CSR during sleep.\r"

We have collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) from 20 PIMM emphysematous patients (44 +/- 12 yr), 24 patients with pneumothorax but no radiologic evidence of emphysema (30 +/- 11 yr), 32 healthy subjects (27 +/- 6 yr), and 56 patients with sarcoidosis (30 +/- 11 yr). The BALF were assayed for immunoreactive albumin, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1PI), leukocyte elastase-alpha 1PI complex (LE-alpha 1PI), and mucus proteinase inhibitor (MPI) as well as for porcine pancreatic elastase inhibitory capacity, a measure of active alpha 1PI. The healthy subjects and the patients with emphysema or pneumothorax had comparable levels of total and active alpha 1PI and total MPI. In contrast, the levels of LE-alpha 1PI complex were elevenfold higher in patients with emphysema than in normal subjects (p = 0.021) and tended to increase with the severity of the disease because they were negatively correlated with FEV1/FVC% (r = -0.55; 0.05 less than p less than 0.1). They did not vary with age in a population of patients with sarcoidosis (r = 0.03), suggesting that their eleven-fold increase in emphysematous patients is not related to the age of these subjects.

In a previous study, a high prevalence of enlarged residual volumes in subjects with the trait were noted. Neutrophil cathepsin G, the target proteinase of ACT, enhances the elastolytic action of elastase. Thus, hypothetically, subjects with the trait may have increased risk for developing pulmonary emphysema. To test whether heterozygous ACT deficiency predisposes to lung disease, plasma ACT concentrations were determined in a cohort of 1,872 middle-aged women. Women with subnormal levels were studied with respect to heredity, airway symptoms, and lung function. Twelve women (0.64% of the cohort) were classified as heterozygotes after family studies and were compared with control subjects, matched for age, weight, sex, and smoking status. There were no significant differences in airway symptoms between heterozygotes and control subjects. However, the prevalence of ex-smokers was significantly higher among heterozygotes than among the screened population as a whole (prevalence ratio, 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-4.72). There were no differences between the heterozygotes and the control subjects in the basal spirometry. However, after bronchodilation, five of the 12 heterozygotes manifested residual volumes greater than 2.5 standard deviations above normal mean compared with one of 24 control subjects (p = 0.012). The present investigation thus confirms our previous findings of an increased prevalence of enlarged residual volumes in heterozygous ACT deficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Its inhibitory potency and profile suggested that it may become a therapeutic adjuvant in diseases where proteinases play a pathogenetic role. In the course of developing recombinant SLPI for therapeutic purposes, we studied its pharmacokinetics after intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intratracheal application to rats. In plasma, SLPI was determined with an ELISA or by following a radiotracer [( 35S]SLPI). In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), SLPI was determined additionally by a functional assay (elastase inhibitory capacity). Intravenously applied SLPI (2 mg/kg) was rapidly cleared, with half-times of distribution of 6 min and half-times of elimination of 50 min. Very little (less than 5%) appeared in the urine even after 24 h. Approximately 80% of intraperitoneally injected SLPI (12 mg/kg) was absorbed and generated maximal plasma concentration of 6 to 10 micrograms/ml 30 to 120 min after administration. When given intratracheally (8.6 mg/kg), SLPI disappeared from the lungs, with a half-time of 4 to 5 h. This value was the same whether the remaining SLPI in BALF was determined radiometrically, by ELISA or by the functional assay, indicating minimal metabolism in the lung. As in the case of intraperitoneal application, SLPI was absorbed systemically, resulting in a maximal plasma level of about 2 micrograms/ml 1 to 2 h after application. In contrast to the measurements in BALF, the ELISA and radiotracer measurements in plasma correlated only for the first 2 h after application and diverged progressively after that, suggesting breakdown of the molecule once it reaches the plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Respiratory gas exchange and VA/Q distributions were measured while the patients breathed room air and 100% O2. Breathing room air, the AaPO2 was moderately increased (25 +/- 12 mm Hg) as was VA/Q mismatching, indicated by the dispersion (log SD) of both blood flow (Q) and ventilation (V) distributions (log SD Q, 0.78 +/- 0.3; and log SD V, 0.66 +/- 0.28, respectively) (normal range, 0.3-0.6). AaPO2, log SD Q, and log SD V all significantly correlated with the emphysema severity assessed morphologically from the resected lung specimens (r = 0.57, r = 0.62, and r = 0.45, respectively). Log SD V also significantly correlated with the severity of the inflammatory infiltrate of membranous bronchioles (r = 0.62). During 100% O2 breathing there was an increase in VA/Q mismatching (log SD Q rose to 1.12 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.001), suggesting release of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This increase in VA/Q inequality was not significantly related to the severity of lung pathologic findings. We conclude that, in mild COPD, both pulmonary emphysema and small airways abnormalities contribute to VA/Q mismatch, the severity of emphysema being the major morphologic correlate of the increase in AaPO2.\r"

The purpose of this exploratory study was to compare plasma amino acids and related compounds and catecholamines in a group of patients with advanced end-stage emphysema with a control group of similar age and sex in an effort to further understand this malnourished state. Fasting blood samples were obtained by venipuncture after a rest period. Plasma amino acid levels were determined by ion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. Plasma catecholamines were determined by radioenzymatic analysis. Anthropometric measurements, the usually accepted biochemical markers of nutrition, dietary analysis, pulmonary function tests, and a historical analysis of the state of health including drug use and smoking history in each subject were analyzed. Ages and heights were comparable, whereas weights were significantly decreased in the patients with emphysema. Total serum protein and serum albumin values were significantly lower in the patient group. Significant respiratory muscle weakness was indicated by reduced negative inspiratory force in these end-stage patients, contrasting with well-preserved muscle strength usually found in obstructive lung disease. The dietary caloric intake of the patients was comparable to that of the control subjects. We conclude that the fine balance of the amino acid pool in patients with bronchitis and emphysema is well preserved, except for significant elevations of aspartic acid, glutamine, and cystine, and a decreased level of leucine. In addition, norepinephrine levels were significantly increased. Weight loss in patients with emphysema and bronchitis is likely due to increased energy demands related to hypermetabolism.\r"

The VA scores correlated linearly with minute ventilation in all subjects in all trials (r = 0.98 +/- 0.01), and when converted to common units (i.e., Z scores) correlated closely with simultaneous scores obtained using the Borg scale (r = 0.99 +/- 0.01). Furthermore, VA scores varied minimally over several trials. Coefficient of variation for the maximal VA scores was 6 +/- 1%, which was similar to the variation in maximal Borg score (i.e., 3 +/- 1%). We conclude that the visual analogue scale is reproducible and correlates closely with the Borg score when scaling the sense of effort to breathe during exercise in subjects with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r"

RIP was calibrated with simultaneous flow measurements (anesthesia mask and pneumotachograph) by the least squares method of statistical analysis. We analyzed segments of breathing with and without flow measurement for RIP-derived VT, change in RC volume (Vrc) and AB volume (Vab) with each breath and the RC contribution to tidal breathing (%RC = Vrc/Vrc + Vab). The %RC increased with age: %RC = 1.4 age (months) + 33 (r = 0.69, p less than 0.01). After 9 months of age, %RC resembled that found in quietly sleeping adolescents. Mask placement increased VT in all but one subject (mean increase, 29 +/- 23% of baseline +/- SD; p less than 0.001, paired t test). In infants younger than 10 months of age, mask placement also increased %RC (without mask, 40 +/- 9%; with mask, 46 +/- 10% p less than 0.02). We conclude that by 1 yr of age, the RC contribution to tidal breathing during quiet sleep is similar to that of the adolescent, suggesting that major developmental changes in RC shape, compliance, and deformability take place during infancy.\r"

We used a dog model with increased inspiratory resistance and hypoxemia to explore the cause. We hypothesized that respiratory muscle fatigue (RMF) played a role in these respiratory arrests, and that the combination of hypoxia and resistive loading would produce respiratory arrest by the mechanism of RMF. Our preparation had transdiaphragmatic pressures that were 40% of maximum (Pdimax = 46.3 +/- 10.0 cm H2O) and progressive hypoxia resulting in a final arterial PO2 of 38 +/- 9 mm Hg and a phrenic vein O2 content of 1.8 +/- 1.1 mg/dl. Instead of failure associated with carbon dioxide retention and RMF, we saw a rapid decrease in tidal volume and respiratory rate, leading to apnea over 30 to 60 s while the diaphragm still responded with significant pressure generation when externally stimulated. These results suggest that respiratory muscle fatigue may not be a major factor in respiratory arrests associated with inspiratory loading and hypoxia, but that suppression of central drive, induced by the combination of inspiratory loading and hypoxemia, may be important.\r"

The effects of altered hemodynamics, however, on the leukocyte sequestration site and on the distribution of leukocyte transit times through the pulmonary microcirculation are unknown. We used in vivo fluorescence videomicroscopy to study the passage of individual, fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled neutrophils through the pulmonary microcirculation of anesthetized dogs. Pulmonary hemodynamics were altered over a wide range. Regardless of the hemodynamic conditions, the only place that any of the 2,919 observed neutrophils stopped was in the capillaries. The periods of immobility had a wide range, from less than 1 to greater than 1,200 s. Because the cells remained motionless once they stopped and then accelerated suddenly as they regained the free-flowing stream, the obstructions must have been discrete. About a quarter of the capillary pathways had one site of high resistance. Another quarter offered two or more obstructions. In the remaining half, the neutrophils passed rapidly and without pause from arteriole to venule. Increases in pressure and flow decreased the number of times that individual cells stopped. These changes altered the median transit time by shifting the distribution of transit times between the slowest and fastest groups. We conclude that most of the total pathlength of perfused capillaries offers little resistance even to neutrophils. There are, however, focal areas in individual capillaries that offer high resistance to neutrophil passage.\r"

  ".W": "Fibronectin (Fn), which is released from several kinds of cells including alveolar macrophages (AM), is important in inflammatory reactions in the certain lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Therefore, information on the mechanisms regulating Fn release from AM may be useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of these diseases and developing therapeutic modalities. We supposed that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is known to modulate cellular functions, might be involved in regulation of Fn release, and, accordingly, we measured the release of Fn and PGE2 from AM from normal volunteers (NV), control patients (CP), and patients with IPF. AM from patients with IPF were found to release more Fn than AM from NV (IPF: 250 +/- 58.8/10(6) cells.24 h, NV: 53.0 +/- 7.3 ng/10(6) cells.24 h) and to release less PGE2 than the latter (IPF: 0.48 +/- 0.12 ng/10(6) cells.24 h, NV:1.35 +/- 0.24 ng/10(6) cells.24 h). A negative correlation was found between the contents of Fn and PGE2 in the culture media of AM from NV, CP, and patients with IPF. Lipopolysaccharide, phorbol myristate acetate, and zymosan suppressed Fn release from AM but stimulated their PGE2 release, and these effects were reversed by indomethacin. Exogenous PGE2 (greater than 1 x 10(-8) M) suppressed Fn release. The albumin-antialbumin complex stimulated Fn release but did not affect PGE2 release. These results indicate that Fn release from AM changed in response to various stimuli, and that PGE2 is important in suppressing Fn release from AM, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism of PGE2 in releasing Fn.\r"

  ".W": "ICI 204,219 (4-(5-cyclopentyloxycarbonylamino-1-methylindol-3-ylmethy l)-3- methoxy-N-o-tolylsulfonylbenzamide) was designed as a peptide leukotriene (LT) antagonist. The compound is a competitive antagonist of LTD4- and LTE4-induced contraction of guinea pig lung tracheal and parenchymal strips with an apparent negative log molar dissociation constant (KB) of approximately 9.6. ICI 204,219 did not antagonize LTC4-induced contractions of guinea pig trachea when the metabolism of LTC4 to LTD4 and, subsequently, to LTE4 was inhibited. The compound inhibited the binding of [3H]LTD4, [3H]LTE4, and [3H]ICI 198,615 (a potent LT antagonist from a different heterocyclic series) to guinea pig lung parenchymal membranes in a competitive manner, and also inhibited [3H]ICI 198,615 binding to human lung parenchymal membranes. ICI 204,219 did not bind to a variety of other receptors when evaluated at concentrations 1,000- to 10,000-fold higher than the apparent KB value for peptide LT receptors. When administered orally, intravenously, or by aerosol, the compound provided dose-related antagonism of the airway effects of aerosol LTD4 in conscious guinea pigs. ED50 values and pharmacodynamic t1/2 (min) for oral, intravenous and aerosol routes of administration were, respectively: 0.52 mumol/kg, greater than 816 min; 0.046 mumol/kg, 85 min; 5.1 x 10(-6) M, 109 min. ICI 204,219 also produced dose-related inhibition of the effects of LTC4 (aerosol or intravenous administration) on pulmonary mechanics in anesthetized guinea pigs when administered orally, intraduodenally, intravenously, or by aerosol. The compound also reversed bronchospasm produced by LTs. Aerosol ovalbumin antigen-induced bronchospasm in guinea pigs was both inhibited and reversed by ICI 204,219. Lastly, the compound inhibited LTD4-induced increases in cutaneous vascular permeability in guinea pigs, being 1,006- and 679-fold more potent than the first generation LT antagonists LY 171,883 and FPL 55712, respectively. ICI 204,219 is a potent, selective, orally active LT antagonist currently undergoing clinical trials.\r"

Previous clinical trials with leukotriene antagonists have shown only minimal protection from subsequent challenge with inhaled LTD4. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we tested the hypothesis that the LTD4 receptor antagonist, ICI 204,219, could inhibit LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction in normal subjects. On separate days, 3 to 7 days apart, a single oral 40-mg dose of ICI 204,219 or placebo was ingested. At 2 h (Group I), 12 h (Group II), or 24 h (Group III) after the dose, six subjects in each group underwent bronchoprovocation testing with aerosolized LTD4. The airway response was assessed by measuring specific airway conductance (SGaw) and the FEV1. ICI 204,219 had no effect on baseline pulmonary function. When given 2 h before the LTD4 challenge, ICI 204,219 increased by 117-fold the concentration of LTD4 required to reduce SGaw 35%: 34 +/- 10 versus 3,965 +/- 894 micrograms/ml (placebo versus ICI 204,219; p less than 0.05). When given 12 h before the LTD4 challenge, ICI 204,219 increased by ninefold the concentration of LTD4 required to reduce SGaw 35%: 33 +/- 11 versus 304 +/- 125 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.05). When given 24 h before the LTD4 challenge, a smaller effect was found: 12 +/- 3 versus 60 +/- 24 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.05). Plasma levels of ICI 204,219 correlated with efficacy across groups (r = 0.83, p less than 0.001), but imperfectly within groups. No adverse effects (symptoms or abnormal laboratory test results) were noted after ingesting the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Experimental studies have shown that the surfactant system of the lung is affected shortly after irradiation. It is unclear, however, whether surfactant plays a role in the pathogenesis of radiation pneumonitis. In the present study surfactant components (saturated phosphatidylcholine, surfactant protein A, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol) and other phospholipids of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) were studied in four patients with pleural mesothelioma before and during hemithorax irradiation (70 Gy) as well as zero, 1, 2, 3, and 4 months following irradiation. The concentrations of these same components and of soluble proteins were also estimated in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) using urea as a marker of dilution. After radiotherapy, the concentrations of the surfactant components in ELF decreased to 12 to 55% of the control values before radiation, whereas the concentration of sphingomyelin in ELF increased ninefold. There were small changes in the other phospholipids. The concentration of soluble protein in ELF increased sevenfold. The minimum surface activity of crude BAL increased from 12 +/- 4 to 32 +/- 6 mN/m, and that of the sediment fraction of BAL increased from 7 +/- 4 to 22 +/- 6 mN/m, p less than 0.001. The protein-rich supernatant fraction of BAL from irradiated lung had a inhibitory effect on normal surfactant. There were significant correlations between the increasing severity of the radiologic changes on the one hand and, on the other, the saturated phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin ratio (p less than 0.001), the concentrations of soluble protein (p less than 0.001), and the concentrations of the surfactant components (p less than 0.02-0.001) in ELF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SETTING: A tertiary care, private teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients who had isolated coronary artery bypass surgery between 1982 and 1987 (total, 2297; 79% male and 21% female). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The inhospital mortality rate was significantly higher for women than for men (4.6% compared with 2.6%; P = 0.036; 95% CI for difference in mortality, 0% to 4.0%). Women were older than men (mean, 68.2 and 64.0 years, respectively; P less than 0.001), and a higher percentage of women were referred with unstable angina (P = 0.007), postmyocardial infarction angina (P = 0.029), congestive heart failure (P less than 0.001), and New York Heart Association class IV symptoms (66% compared with 45%, P less than 0.001). More men were referred with a history of an abnormal exercise test (P less than 0.001), and patients referred because of a positive exercise test had a lower mortality (P less than 0.001). Using multivariate analysis, adjustment for the higher preoperative functional class of women and for age accounted for all of the difference in mortality between men and women (odds ratio, 1.04; CI, 0.60 to 1.79; P = 0.89). After correction for functional class alone, there continued to be no significant difference in mortality between men and women (P = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in functional class and age account for the higher operative mortality of women in coronary bypass surgery. Women are referred for coronary bypass surgery later in the course of their disease than men, and later referral may increase their changes of operative death.\r"

DESIGN: A prospectively evaluated case series. PATIENTS: We studied 31 cushingoid asthmatics who needed daily prednisone and were found to be unable to reduce their prednisone dosage. These patients had used maximal daily doses of bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroid and, on average, had used prednisone, 26.8 mg/d, for 4.7 years (range, 1 to 11 years). Of these 31 patients, 25 completed 18 to 28 months of methotrexate therapy. INTERVENTION: Patients were treated for at least 18 months with low-dose methotrexate (range, 15 to 50 mg/wk). RESULTS: The mean prednisone dose was reduced from 26.9 mg/d to 6.3 mg/d (P = 0.0001) in the 25 patients treated with long-term methotrexate: Fifteen patients discontinued the regular use of prednisone, 9 patients reduced prednisone use by more than 50%, and 1 patient failed to respond. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) improved from 1.7 L/s to 1.9 L/s (P = 0.0513), and subjective symptom scores for breathing ability, cough, wheeze, and frequency of nocturnal awakenings all improved. Adverse drug reactions were noted in 15 patients. These reactions were mild and did not lead to discontinuation of drug therapy. CONCLUSION: Methotrexate is effective and safe when used as a long-term, corticosteroid sparing agent in patients with severe bronchial asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Low back pain is common, but a herniated intervertebral disk is the cause in only a small percentage of cases. Most symptomatic disk herniations result in clinical manifestations (pain, reflex loss, muscle weakness) that resolve with conservative therapy, and only 5% to 10% of patients require surgery. Sciatica is usually the first clue to disk herniation, but sciatica may be mimicked by other disorders that cause radiating pain. Because more than 95% of lumbar disk herniations occur at the L4-5 or L5-S1 levels, the physical examination should focus on abnormalities of the L5 and S1 nerve roots. Plain radiography is not useful in diagnosing disk herniation, but more sophisticated imaging (myelography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) should generally be delayed until a patient is clearly a surgical candidate. Conservative therapy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, brief bed rest (often for less than 1 week), early progressive ambulation, and reassurance about a favorable prognosis. Muscle relaxants and narcotic analgesics have a limited role, and their use should be strictly time-limited. Conventional traction and corsets are probably ineffective. Except for patients with the cauda equina syndrome, surgery is generally appropriate only when there is a combination of definite disk herniation shown by imaging, a corresponding syndrome of sciatic pain, a corresponding neurologic deficit, and a failure to respond to 6 weeks of conservative therapy.\r"

PATIENTS: Sixty consecutive adult patients (over 16 years of age) evaluated for tracheobronchial foreign body aspiration. INTERVENTIONS: All 60 patients had bronchoscopic evaluation; 59 of them had foreign bodies identified and removal was attempted using either rigid or flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy. MAIN RESULTS: Of 60 consecutive patients, 25 had underlying impairment of protective airway mechanisms (primary neurologic disorders, trauma with loss of consciousness, or sedative or alcohol use). Fifty-seven were successfully managed with bronchoscopy. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was successful in 14 of 23 patients, and rigid bronchoscopy was successful in 43 of 44 patients, including 6 of 7 patients in whom previous fiberoptic bronchoscopy had failed. Thoracotomy was required in 3 patients. Complications of bronchoscopy were rare and not serious. Chronic complications of prolonged foreign body impaction included bronchiectasis in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, tracheobronchial foreign body aspiration in adults can occur in various clinical settings. High clinical suspicion is necessary for diagnosis. Removal of foreign bodies can usually be accomplished with bronchoscopy.\r"

The laryngeal manual compression tests are simple to perform and noninvasive. Each of the four examinations yields valuable information on the effects on the voice of changes in vocal cord characteristics produced by manual compression. In this report, one of the four tests, lateral manual compression, is evaluated objectively with well-attested methods of videostroboscopic, aerodynamic, and acoustic analysis. The technique of performing lateral manual compression is described, and advantages and disadvantages are noted and compared in 10 patients. Preliminary findings in 4 patients in this group indicate that medialization laryngoplasty should be considered when test results are conclusive of effective glottic closure.

To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of a temporal bone histopathologic study from a patient having had the diagnosis of a labyrinthine arterial vascular accident.\r"

At present, there are three different federal regulations that address this problem, by specifying different dimensions of height, width, and length. The Small Parts Regulation, which affects toy size, is the least stringent and is being challenged. The anatomic and physiologic concepts behind these important regulations are analyzed and discussed. The idea of a single generic standard is also reviewed.\r"

The AICA originated from the basilar artery (98.1%) or from the vertebral artery (1.9%) as a single (92.3% of CPAs) or duplicate (7.7%) artery. Each of the 52 CPAs had one or more arterial trunks that coursed in close proximity to the seventh and eighth cranial nerves and thus were said to be nerve-related. The nerve-related arterial trunks were divided into three segments based on their relationship to the nerves and meatus: the premeatal, meatal, and postmeatal segments. The nerve-related branches of the AICA gave rise to the internal auditory artery in 92.3% of the CPAs, the recurrent perforating artery in 78.8%, and the subarcuate artery in 30.8%. The importance of understanding the surgical anatomy of the neurovascular complex of the CPA when performing a vestibular neurectomy is reviewed.\r"

This hypermetabolic state is triggered by inhalational anesthetics and/or depolarizing muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine. Even the use of dantrolene may not be protective against the hypermetabolic crisis. Eight patients at risk for MH undergoing tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and/or myringotomy with ventilation tube insertion were anesthetized with nitrous oxide, barbiturates, opiates, tranquilizers, and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants without dantrolene and without complication. Cardiac monitoring and rectal temperatures were followed. In order to provide additional evidence, all eight patients had vastus lateralis muscle biopsies with subsequent caffeine-halothane contracture studies performed. The contracture study showed positive results in seven of eight patients studied, indicating MH-susceptible muscle. No anesthetic or operative complications were encountered. This study demonstrates that patients at risk of developing MH crisis can have otolaryngologic procedures performed relatively safely while undergoing appropriately selected anesthesia.\r"

The considerable morbidity resulting from loss of functional tongue includes compromised deglutition, chronic aspiration, and altered speech articulation. The particular operative approach used dictates additional secondary morbidity, which may include cosmetic and functional defects of the mandibular arch, malocclusion, lip and chin scars, and postoperative changes in the oral cavity. Our recent experience with a transpharyngeal approach in 13 patients with tongue base cancer is reviewed. Adequate operative exposure was obtained in all cases. Persistent aspiration was not a problem, and all patients learned to swallow effectively. The transpharyngeal approach avoids unnecessary surgical trauma to the mandible and anterior oral cavity and minimizes cosmetic deformity. Our early experience with this approach is encouraging.\r"

The distribution of goblet cells was found to be extremely irregular, ranging from areas completely devoid of goblet cells to areas with a relatively high density. The median density varied from 280 cells/mm2 to 10,000 cells/mm2. The total median density for all 15 polyps located anteriorly in the nose was 3,450 cells/mm2, compared with 6,050 cells/mm2 for 14 posteriorly located polyps. The density was highest in pseudostratified, cylindric epithelium, although great variations occurred among the different areas with this type of epithelium. The goblet cell density may be influenced by several factors, such as the airflow, type and thickness of the epithelium, and whether the genesis of the nasal polyps is infectious or allergic, in addition to polyp growth, size, and age.\r"

  ".W": "A small amount of perilymph was suctioned from the scala tympani through the round window membrane of guinea pigs. The animals either were killed immediately after the suctioning or were kept alive for 1 to 3 months. For morphologic study, the conventional celloidin embedding method was employed, and the temporal bones were serially sectioned. Various kinds and degrees of changes in the membranous labyrinth were observed: hydrops, collapse, and rupture. Loss of outer hair cells in the upper turns of the cochlea was noted in the 1- to 3-month recovery specimens. These findings are identical to those found in animals in which artificial perilymph was injected into the subarachnoid space in order to produce experimental perilymphatic fistula. After comparing morphologic changes of the membranous labyrinth following use of each method, we concluded that perilymph suctioning from the round window can be used as an animal model of perilymphatic fistula.\r"

  ".W": "The selective involvement of spinocerebellar neurons in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was investigated using two monoclonal antibodies that have neuronal subset specificity in human spinal cord. In normal control subjects, monoclonal antibody 6A2 showed specificity for neurons of the dorsal nucleus of Clarke, the cells of origin of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract. Immunoreactive neurons were also observed in locations corresponding to the central cervical nucleus and spinal border region, containing neurons of the cervicospinocerebellar and ventral spinocerebellar tracts, respectively. The latter two neuronal subsets are indistinguishable from surrounding neurons when conventional histological stains are used. Antigen 6A2 was distributed on surfaces of neuronal somas and proximal neurites and extended into the extracellular space. A second antibody, monoclonal antibody 44.1, labeled the cytoplasm of neuronal somas and neurites, including all monoclonal antibody 6A2-reactive cells and alpha motoneurons. In spinal cords of all 5 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, monoclonal antibody 6A2 reactivity in the majority of spinocerebellar neurons was absent or localized to the somal cytoplasm, which still stained with monoclonal antibody 44.1. In more severely involved tissues, there was loss of some spinocerebellar neurons and a corresponding loss of monoclonal antibody 44.1 reactivity. These findings confirm involvement of the spinal cord components of the spinocerebellar system at all levels in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and suggest that some surface molecules are modified during the degenerative process.\r"
