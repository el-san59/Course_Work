  ".W": "The adrenergic innervation of smooth and striated muscle components of the intrinsic external urethral sphincter from patients with suprasacral lesions and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia has been described previously, when no adrenergic nerves were found associated with striated muscle fibers. In our study the intrinsic external urethral sphincter from patients with lower motor neuron lesions and detrusor areflexia was studied histochemically using the glyoxylic acid method to visualize catecholamines. Varicose adrenergic nerves were demonstrated in the smooth muscle. Adrenergic nerve fibers also were found along the edge of individual striated muscle fibers as well as around striated muscle bundles. Blood vessels in both regions of the urethral sphincter were innervated by adrenergic nerves. We conclude that in patients with lower motor neuron lesions and detrusor areflexia there is a substantial invasion by adrenergic nerve fibers in relation to smooth and striated muscle in the urethra, although the function of the nerve fibers is not known.\r"

Of the 105 patients 69 had been treated previously by a perineal pull-through technique and 36 by transpubic urethroplasty. A total of 18 patients (10 in the transpubic and 8 in the pull-through groups) whose results were fair or poor underwent internal urethrotomy with the Sachse knife as a complementary treatment after posterior urethroplasty. Internal urethrotomy provided good results in 8 patients (80 per cent) in the transpubic group and 5 (62.5 per cent) in the pull-through group. None of the patients was incontinent and there was no symptomatic urinary infection postoperatively.\r"

Of the men 41 per cent required an increased dose of medications during followup, and 40 per cent of 50 men had at least 1 abnormality of liver function, most of these involving mild to moderate elevations of alkaline phosphatase and lactic dehydrogenase. Priapism was not encountered during self-injection but it did occur twice in 329 physician-administered injections. Careful regular monitoring of patients should continue as some patients enter the second year of treatment.\r"

In the first stage the left adrenal gland was removed with its attached blood vessels intact, and adrenal autotransplantation then was performed. An end-to-end anastomosis was made between the adrenal central vein and the right inferior epigastric artery. The anastomosis between the right saphenous vein and the adrenal middle artery was accomplished by intussuscepting the artery into the vein followed by suturing. The second stage operation was total right adrenalectomy. Steroid replacement therapy was stopped 7 days postoperatively and all laboratory studies were normal. Two months after total right adrenalectomy the patient had a sensation of facial fullness. Plasma cortisol and 24-hour urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels were elevated. Part of the graft was excised with the patient under local anesthesia. The symptoms disappeared and the laboratory studies returned to normal. Pituitary irradiation was administered as supplementary treatment of Cushing's disease. This method for the treatment of Cushing's disease has proved feasible. The inguinal region is the optimal site for adrenal autotransplantation.\r"

Inflatable penile prostheses were implanted in 19 patients who had undergone cystoprostatectomy with prophylactic urethrectomy. Of the patients 13 underwent cystoprostatectomy with en bloc urethrectomy and delayed placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis. The remaining 6 patients required urethrectomy and simultaneous implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis 6 to 12 weeks after radical cystectomy. All 19 patients healed appropriately and had an adequate functioning prosthesis. However, results in patients in whom the glandular urethra could be preserved safely were far superior to those in patients requiring total urethrectomy. This was so because of easier and improved cylinder placement with better support to the glans, increased glandular sensation and a more acceptable penile appearance. The inflatable penile prosthesis can be used successfully in the cystourethrectomy patient with gratifying results, especially when the glandular urethra remains intact.\r"

At least 40 different types of human papillomavirus have been identified and these types vary not only in their deoxyribonucleic acid base sequences but also in their clinical manifestations. Although deoxyribonucleic acid probes currently have a role only in a research setting, this study delineates the possible role of this technology in a clinical setting to detect subclinical intraurethral human papillomavirus. The results have widespread implications regarding the treatment of condyloma and the associated cervical dysplasia. In this series 25 grossly visible lesions were typed and 85 per cent contained human papillomavirus types 6 and 11. In contrast, microscopic lesions identified in the male partners of women with cervical dysplasia were shown to contain human papillomavirus types 16, 18 or 31 in 60 per cent of the cases. In addition, urethral brushings were obtained and were positive for human papillomavirus in 50 per cent of the cases despite normal urethroscopy. Human papillomavirus types 16, 18 or 31 accounted for 70 per cent of the positive urethral brushings.\r"

  ".W": "The primary objective of this retrospective 15-year survival analysis of 57 men with clinical stage B1 carcinoma of the prostate undergoing radical prostatectomy between 1951 and 1963 is to compute the cause-specific curve for these men and argue why it is a useful method to report survival data in men with clinically localized prostatic cancer. Historically, survival following radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy has been reported using all cause survival analysis. Cause-specific survival focuses on the impact of a disease process on survival, since men dying of causes unrelated to carcinoma of the prostate are considered lost to followup as of date of death of such unrelated causes. Cause-specific survival analysis reduces the impact of age, medical condition and other risk factors on survival rates. The cause-specific 15-year actuarial survival rate in our patients was 86 per cent. The 95 per cent confidence interval for this 15-year survival rate was 76.9 to 90.1 per cent. Based upon this series of patients with clinical stage B1 carcinoma of the prostate who undergo radical prostatectomy one may state that the chance of death of carcinoma of the prostate within 15 years of surgery averages 14 +/- 5 per cent. The cause-specific survival curve reached a plateau at 10 years, indicating that most men who survive 10 years are cured of the disease. With the Cox model regression analysis, mortality in this series was related positively to age at operation when the outcome variable was death of all causes (p equals 0.003) but it was unrelated to age when the outcome variable was prostate cancer mortality (p equals 0.85). Cause-specific survival rates are a more precise indicator of the impact of a therapeutic modality on survival and, therefore, they are useful to report survival data in men with localized carcinoma of the prostate and other disease when death from competing causes is an important consideration.\r"

We tested 42 strains of microorganisms to determine the minimum microwaving time needed to sterilize the catheters. Representative urinary isolates of Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Candida species were tested. Mean sterilization time for all strains was 13.0 minutes (standard deviation +/- 5.7 minutes), with a range of 4.0 to 28.6 minutes. Repeat sterilization in the microwave oven did not affect the integrity of the catheter. A water heat sink of constant volume was required. A home microwave oven may be used as a method to sterilize red rubber catheters for reuse. This technique makes aseptic intermittent self-catheterization a practical possibility.\r"

The number of such wedges required is equal to the measured difference in centimeters between the lengths of the asymmetric, concave and convex surfaces of the affected penis, between the pubis and mid glans. Results of application of this principle in 6 patients are presented.\r"

Functional pouch capacity, intrapouch pressure, maximal nipple pressure, maximal nipple closure pressure and functional nipple length with the pouch filled to capacity were measured. Intermittent involuntary pressure spikes resembling bowel peristaltic waves occurred in 5 patients (25 per cent). The mean functional pouch capacity was 280.0 +/- 119.2 ml. (standard deviation) and mean maximal intra-pouch pressure was 41.0 +/- 11.0 cm. water in patients with involuntary pressure spikes. In patients without involuntary pressure spikes these values were 332.7 +/- 114.5 ml. and 11.6 +/- 4.8 cm. water, respectively. For all patients the mean maximal nipple pressure was 72.1 +/- 24.6 cm. water, the mean maximal nipple closure pressure was 58.8 +/- 23.1 cm. water and the mean functional nipple length was 3.4 +/- 0.9 cm. A functional nipple length of less than or equal to 2.5 cm. and/or a low maximal nipple closure pressure (less than 40 cm. water) correlated with a small functional pouch capacity (less than 200 ml.) in 5 patients. Clinically, these 5 patients also required frequent catheterization to provide continence. A maximal nipple closure pressure greater than 60 cm. water and an adequate functional nipple length (greater than 3.0 cm.) correlated with a rather large functional pouch capacity (more than 350 ml.). The degree of continence provided by the Kock pouch appeared to be determined by functional nipple length, maximal nipple closure pressure, functional pouch capacity and maximal intrapouch pressure.\r"

It is too early, however, to decide if the percutaneous approach to reducing lumbar disk herniation will achieve a permanent place in the surgical armamentarium. Nevertheless, it is clear that patient selection is important. At the minimum, an adequate trial of conservative therapy must be followed by diagnostic imaging that documents a herniation that can be treated in this fashion and correlates with the patient's neurological signs and symptoms. If free fragments are found, a laminectomy of some sort will be required to remove the offending material. Patients who are at risk for general anesthesia or may be allergic to chymopapain were mentioned by the panel as special subpopulations for whom the procedure may be indicated despite the lack of wide experience with it. The rapidly rising popularity of automated percutaneous lumbar diskectomy via the nucleotome will hopefully be followed in the near future with larger studies with long-term follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "Trends in the prevalence, initiation, and cessation of cigarette smoking are reported for the US population using weighted and age-standardized data from seven National Health Interview Surveys (1974 to 1985). The decline in prevalence was linear, with the prevalence for men decreasing at 0.91 percentage points per year to 33.5% in 1985 and the prevalence for women decreasing at 0.33 percentage points per year to 27.6% in 1985. For whites the rate of decline (percentage points per year) was 0.57, to 29.4% in 1985, and for blacks the decline was 0.67, to 35.6% in 1985. Smoking cessation increased among all gender-race groups from 1974 to 1985, with the yearly rate of increase (in percentage points per year) about equivalent for blacks (0.75) and whites (0.77), while it was higher in women (0.90) than in men (0.67). Smoking initiation decreased among young men (-1.03), while it remained about the same in young women (+0.11). Initiation decreased at a more rapid rate in blacks (-1.02) than in whites (-0.35). We conclude that smoking prevalence is decreasing across all race-gender groups, although at a slower rate for women than men, and that differences in initiation, more than cessation, are primarily responsible for the converging of smoking prevalence rates among men and women.\r"

  ".W": "National trends in smoking prevalence by educational category from 1974 through 1985 show that education has replaced gender as the major sociodemographic predictor of smoking status. Smoking prevalence has declined across all educational groups but the decline has occurred five times faster among the higher educated compared with the less educated. From 1974 to 1985, smoking prevalence among persons with less than a high school diploma declined to 34.2% (0.19 percentage points per year) whereas prevalence for persons with four years or more of college education declined to 18.4% (0.91 percentage points per year). Smoking cessation activity increased across all educational groups, but the rate of increase among the higher educated was twice that of lower-educated groups. Initiation of smoking among more-educated men decreased rapidly to 15% in 1985 but leveled off by 1987. Until 1985, less-educated young females were the only group in which smoking initiation was increasing. However, in 1987 a sudden and large decline in initiation among less-educated females occurred. The apparent recent changes in initiation patterns by educational level suggest that the converging of smoking prevalence between the genders may not continue. The large and widening educational gap in smoking suggests that health promotion priorities need to be reassessed.\r"

Smoking prevalence in the United States has declined at a linear rate since 1974. If this trend continues, in the year 2000, 22% of the adult population (40 million Americans) will be smokers. By the year 2000, the major inequalities in prevalence will occur among educational categories. At least 30% of those who have not proceeded beyond a high school education will be smokers, whereas less than 10% of college graduates will smoke. Among the other sociodemographic subgroups, smoking prevalence is expected to decrease by the year 2000 to 20% among men, to 23% among women, to 25% among blacks, and to 21% among whites. Between 1974 and 1985, approximately 1.3 million persons per year became former smokers, indicating considerable success in public health efforts to encourage people to stop smoking. However, in the early 1980s, approximately 1 million new young persons per year were recruited to the ranks of regular smokers. This is equivalent to about 3000 new smokers each day. Public health efforts need to focus more on preventing young people from starting to smoke, and such prevention efforts should particularly target less educated socioeconomic groups.\r"

We constructed smoking prevalence curves for men and women among successive ten-year birth cohorts. Birth cohort-specific prevalence rates were higher for men than for women. Rates, however, decreased among successive cohorts of men. Conversely, rates increased among successive cohorts of Cuban-American and Puerto Rican-American women. For example, peak rates among the 1911 through 1920 cohorts were 26% (Cuban-American women) and 25% (Puerto Rican-American women) compared with peak rates of 43% and 52%, respectively, among comparable groups from 1951 through 1960. These results demonstrate that despite a reduction of cigarette smoking among successive cohorts of Hispanic men, Hispanic women have made little progress or have actually increased their cigarette smoking.\r"

To assess progress toward meeting this objective, we used cross-sectional data from the 26 states in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 1985 and 1986. We compared the prevalence of self-reported smoking among pregnant (N = 836) and nonpregnant (N = 18,025) women aged 18 to 45 years. Overall, pregnant women were 70% as likely to be current smokers as nonpregnant women (prevalence ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.6 to 0.8), while blacks showed the largest pregnancy-associated reduction in the prevalence of smoking (prevalence ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.9). Most of the difference in smoking prevalence occurred not because pregnant women were less likely to have ever smoked, but because pregnant women were more likely to have quit smoking than nonpregnant women. However, unmarried pregnant white women were 40% more likely to smoke than their nonpregnant counterparts (prevalence ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.7). We conclude from this analysis that the 1990 health objective for smoking among pregnant women is unlikely to be achieved. Clinicians providing care to pregnant women need to pay increased attention to smoking cessation.\r"

After an aggressive six-month campaign using communitywide media, direct merchant education, contact with the chief executive officers of chain stores and franchise operations owned by major companies, and grassroots work with community organizations, the percentage of stores with illegal over-the-counter sale of cigarettes to minors was reduced to 39%. Sales from vending machines were not reduced. While much remains to be accomplished in stopping the illegal sale of tobacco to minors, data from this study illustrate that a well-designed community and merchant education campaign can significantly reduce such sales.\r"

Despite its potential public health role, there have been few published studies on the effectiveness of these warnings as a health message. The present study used well-accepted market research methods to examine adolescent viewing of tobacco advertisements. Sixty-one adolescents participated in the study. Eye tracking was used to study how participants viewed five different tobacco advertisements. The average viewing time of the warning amounted to only 8% of the total advertisement viewing time. In 43.6% of cases, the warning was not viewed at all. Following the advertisement viewing, participants were asked to identify the observed warnings within a list that included other simulated warnings. Subjects did only slightly better than random guessing in this test of recognition. Using market research criteria, the federally mandated warning must be viewed as an ineffective public health message in so far as adolescents are concerned.\r"

  ".W": "Outdoor advertising media represent a major vehicle by which cigarette companies promote their products. We investigated the readability of the Surgeon General's warning in cigarette advertisements (ads) in two outdoor media: billboards and taxicab ads. In an experiment in metropolitan Atlanta under typical driving conditions, observers were able to read the entire health warning on 18 (46%) of 39 street billboards but on only two (5%) of 39 highway billboards. In contrast, the content of the ads (ie, brand name, other wording, and notable imagery) could be recognized under the same conditions on more than 95% of the billboards. In a similar study of 100 taxicab cigarette ads in New York City, observers were unable to read the health warning in any of the ads but were able to identify the brand name in all ads and notable imagery in 95% of the ads. Significant differences between the readability of the warning and identification of the advertising content persisted even when partially read warnings were considered to have been read. We conclude that the Surgeon General's warning is not readable in its current form in the vast majority of billboard and taxicab ads. Factors contributing to unreadability include the small size of the letters, the excessive length of the warnings, the distance between the viewers and the ads, and movement between the viewers and the ads.\r"

The message being given to patients and staff concerning the health risk of smoking is now more consistent, and there has been wide acceptance of the policy by staff and patients. It is concluded that such a policy can be effectively implemented, if it is well planned and supported.\r"

Myopia was present in 59% of the ocular hypertensives and 73% of the primary open-angle glaucoma patients, of whom 39% had more than 6 diopters of myopia. All eyes of black patients with more than 3 diopters of myopia had glaucomatous defects compared with 52% of such eyes of white patients. Our data suggest that myopia is strongly associated with juvenile open-angle glaucoma and that young black patients with elevated intraocular pressure, especially when myopic, are more susceptible to glaucomatous damage than are whites.\r"

Approximately 90% of the staff and a majority of the patients (72%) thought a voluntary HIV screening program should be offered to all patients. Almost all staff (98%), but only 50% of the patients, felt the HIV test results should be known to physicians, nurses, and counselors at the clinic. Few staff members (15%) believed that patients had changed their sex behavior; more (48%) felt that needle sharing was reduced. Patients believed methadone patients in general had changed their sex behavior (49.2%) and reduced needle sharing (62%) to prevent becoming infected. Patients reported statistically significant reductions both in number of sex partners and in personal needle sharing during the past year.\r"

There is concern, however, that there may be a disproportionate use of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical research due to the inner city location of most university hospitals. To examine this issue, we reviewed the representation of American blacks in 50 recently published clinical trials of new drugs. This survey revealed that investigators do not seem to adequately take into account racial differences as a potential source of variability. It also was found that in the majority of studies, the proportion of black subjects is less than their proportion in the general population. This underrepresentation in clinical trials suggests that insufficient data exist to accurately assess the safety and efficacy of many new drugs in American blacks.\r"

Addressing this underrepresentation of blacks in medicine not only is a matter of justice, equity, and national conscience but also has implications for the provision of quality physician care to this nation's minority and medically underserved populations. Black physicians are more likely to understand the cultural and social context of illness and disability among blacks and are also more likely to be able to communicate effectively with black patients. Black physicians are also more likely to practice in communities whose residents lack adequate access to medical care. An approach to addressing the problem of underrepresentation is proposed, consisting of activities at the precollege, college, and medical school levels.\r"

  ".W": "While an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) is known to be associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications, the impact of one abnormal value is not clear. In 1986 we screened 4618 pregnant women for gestational diabetes at 24-28 weeks' gestation. Eighty-seven percent had normal results; of the 13% with abnormal screening tests, 139 had one abnormal value on the subsequent 3-hour oral GTT. These women were then compared with 725 randomly selected patients with a normal screening test. The frequency of chronic hypertension, cesarean section, 5-minute Apgar score below 7, preterm delivery, shoulder dystocia, congenital malformations, and perinatal mortality did not differ significantly between the groups. The incidence of macrosomia (birth weight above 4000 g) was significantly greater in the study group (18.0%) than in the control group (6.6%) (odds ratio 2.18; 95% confidence interval 1.77-5.37), a relationship that persisted after controlling for confounding risk factors by logistic regression modeling (odds ratio 2.55; 95% confidence interval 1.44-4.52). The incidence of preeclampsia/eclampsia was significantly greater in the study group (7.9%) than in the control group (3.3%) (odds ratio 2.51; 95% confidence interval 1.14-5.52), which also persisted after controlling for confounding risk factors using logistic regression modeling (odds ratio 2.81; 95% confidence interval 1.26-6.28). Our results suggest that patients with one abnormal value on an oral GTT during pregnancy are at risk for delivering macrosomic infants and developing preeclampsia/eclampsia.\r"

All neonates had echoencephalograms performed by the fourth day of life to diagnose the presence and severity of intraventricular hemorrhage. One hundred fifty-six sets of twins were included in the study, of which 59 were in a vertex/vertex presentation, 59 in vertex/nonvertex presentation, and 38 with twin A in a nonvertex presentation. Second twins were characterized by a higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS): 66 versus 54% (P less than .05), and severe grades of intraventricular hemorrhage: 30 versus 19% (P less than .01). For vertex/vertex twins, cesarean delivery did not result in improved outcome. Rather, the incidence of RDS was significantly increased in neonates from this group delivered by cesarean birth: 67 versus 46% (P less than .01). Among twins in which at least one of the fetuses was in a nonvertex presentation, those born via cesarean delivery demonstrated a lower incidence of both severe grades of intraventricular hemorrhage and mortality. However, after multivariate analysis to correct for differences in birth weight between the groups, no advantage for cesarean delivery could be demonstrated. Therefore, differences in birth weight, rather than in mode of delivery, accounted for the differences in the neonatal outcome of nonvertex-presenting twins.\r"

An extended carbon dioxide laser procedure involved vaporization of the epithelium of the entire lower genital tract. We performed the procedure under colposcopic guidance. Vaporization was carried out in continuity, to an appropriate tissue depth, while using recommended power densities for the respective target tissue. For sexually active study patients, male consorts were evaluated and treated concurrently to reduce the risk of recurrent infection. Postoperative morbidity was considerable, with moderate to severe vulvar pain and febrile reactions occurring in 100 and 76% of patients, respectively. Histologic persistence of subclinical papillomavirus infection was documented in 88% of study patients at follow-up examination. Neither treatment of the male consort nor sexual abstinence significantly improved treatment outcome. These data suggest that extended carbon dioxide laser procedures cause significant short-term morbidity without effectively eradicating subclinical papillomavirus infection of the female lower genital tract.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the relationship between pain and cognitive activity during the latent (less than or equal to 3 cm), mid-active (5-7 cm), and transition (greater than or equal to 8 cm) phases of labor and the concomitant efficiency of the latent, active, and descent phases in 115 nulliparous women. Patients provided subjective pain ratings and described their thoughts during each of the three phases. Higher levels of pain during the latent phase of labor were predictive of longer latent (r = 0.58) and active (r = 0.50) phases of labor. Distress-related thoughts during latent labor were predictive of longer latent (r = 0.31, P less than .01), active (r = 0.67), and second-stage (r = 0.61) labor. We found no relationships between pain and cognitive activity measured during active labor and efficiency of active labor or second stage of labor. Pain and cognitive activity assessed during the latent phase were also prognostic of obstetric outcome. Thirteen of 19 women (68.4%) who reported \"horrible\" or \"excruciating\" pain required instrumental delivery, compared with eight of 27 women (29.6%) in the \"discomforting\" pain group. Subjects in the \"distress-related\" cognitive group had 2.6 times the incidence of instrumental delivery, five times the incidence of abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, and four times the requirement for pediatric assistance for the neonate than subjects in the \"coping\" group. We conclude that latent labor is a critical phase in the psychobiology of labor and that pain and cognitive activity during this phase are important contributors to labor efficiency and obstetric outcome.\r"

There was no statistically significant difference in the results between medical and surgical therapy. All failures in the surgically treated group were due to persistent detrusor instability after surgery. We identified no preoperative urodynamic criteria that consistently and accurately predicted surgical outcome in patients with combined stress and urge incontinence. Patients with combined stress incontinence and detrusor instability should initially be managed medically, as this will reduce the incidence of surgical intervention.\r"

The intention was to perform further surgical debulking (intervention debulking surgery) after three cycles in patients responding to treatment. Intervention debulking surgery was carried out in 28 of 36 patients (78%) at a median interval of 12.7 weeks from primary diagnosis. Omentectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy were the most commonly performed procedures at intervention debulking. As a result of such surgery, 16 of the 28 women (57%) were left with no macroscopic residual disease, five (18%) had less than 1 cm, four (14%) less than 2 cm residuum, and three (11%) remained with more extensive disease. Post-intervention debulking surgical complications were few, with a median postoperative hospital stay of 10 days and a median interval of 21 days from debulking surgery to resumption of chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant (cytoreductive) chemotherapy combined with early secondary surgical debulking is feasible, with little severe morbidity, and can leave a high proportion of patients free of macroscopic disease. The effect of such a program on patient survival is now being tested in a randomized study.\r"

Microscopic examination of immunohistochemical staining of a juvenile granulosa cell tumor with anti-follicle regulatory protein antisera showed homogeneous cytosolic expression of follicle regulatory protein throughout the tumor. Tumor cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Partially purified follicle regulatory protein (50 micrograms/day) was then injected daily for 10 days, or for 25 days once the tumor became palpable. Treatment with follicle regulatory protein significantly slowed the rate of tumor growth with both treatments. To test the tissue specificity of the effect, a metastatic, well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma was also grown in nude mice. Follicle regulatory protein treatment did not alter the rate of tumor growth. An in vitro clonigenic assay confirmed these in vivo results. Partially purified follicle regulatory protein had a biphasic effect on the proliferation of juvenile granulosa tumor cell but did not affect the proliferation of endometrial adenocarcinoma cells. Clonigenic assays were performed on five ovarian adenocarcinomas passaged in vitro, and these tumor cells exhibited a biphasic response to follicle regulatory protein. Immunoneutralization studies showed that this biphasic response was due to impurities in the follicle regulatory protein preparations. The longer the exposure of the tumor cells to follicle regulatory protein, the greater the degree of inhibition of proliferation. In summary, administration of follicle regulatory protein slowed tumor growth through a direct effect on the tumor cell rather than an indirect effect on the hormonal or immune status of the host.\r"

Among the patients with uterine malignancies, only a few cases showed serum sialyl Lewis-Xi antigen values in excess of the cutoff limit. On the other hand, among the patients with ovarian cancers, serum sialyl Lewis-Xi antigen was elevated significantly in the following order: clinical stage I (44%), stage II (50%), and stage III (62%). The antigen level also correlated with the effect of treatment. However, serum sialyl Lewis-Xi antigen was elevated in 9% of patients with benign ovarian cysts and in 1.4% of normal volunteers. The lack of tumor specificity of sialyl Lewis-Xi antigen limits its diagnostic value for gynecologic malignancies, but serial measurement of this antigen may be useful in evaluating therapy and monitoring patients.\r"

In the first trimester, the serum albumin concentration was already diminished. Likewise, the serum reserve albumin for bilirubin binding was reduced gradually during pregnancy. These reductions were evident as early as the 20th week of gestation, and at delivery the level averaged 53% of the nonpregnant level. The reduction in bilirubin binding capacity was partly dependent on the decreasing serum albumin concentration, but a reduction in the albumin molecule's binding capability was also shown. This binding defect, which is also present in neonates, is not fully explained. The reduction in bilirubin binding capability probably reflects a reduced degree of protein binding for many protein-bound drugs during pregnancy, which may contribute to pharmacokinetic alterations in pregnancy.\r"

A semiquantitative DIC scoring system was used retrospectively to augment the diagnostic confidence of coagulopathy. At the time of admission to the hospital, three patients showed no evidence of DIC, eight had suspected DIC, and seven had manifest DIC. The intravascular coagulation process was progressive in all patients; upon delivery, eight patients proved to have suspected DIC and ten had manifest DIC. The laboratory criteria of DIC were found to agree with the degree of organ dysfunction. Patients with manifest DIC at delivery developed significantly more life-threatening maternal complications than did patients with suspected DIC (P less than .02). Conservative management was not possible in any patients who were admitted with overt DIC because of deterioration of maternal and fetal status. Application of a sensitive DIC scoring system may be valuable in managing patients with the HELLP syndrome and selecting patients who may be treated expectantly.\r"

There is very little information in the literature on what makes up the fold. Four fresh cadavers were studied by taking a strip of facial tissue from each at right angles to the fold; all soft tissue layers through the face were included. Microscopic studies of the strips showed the fold to be made up of (1) dense fibrous tissue, (2) muscle fibers branching from the levator muscles of the upper lip, and (3) striated muscle bundles originating in the fold fascia. The studies also revealed the lip elevator muscles and the \"fold muscles\" coursing down the lip to traverse the orbicularis oris and insert into the dermis of the upper lip, the cutaneous vermilion junction, and vermilion. The smile is formed in stages, the first stage raising the lip to the fold by the levator muscles and the muscle bundles originating in the fold. The lip meets resistance at the fold because of cheek fat. The second stage involves the raising of the lip and fold upward by the levator muscles of the upper lip. Clinically, this study relates to reanimating the paralyzed face.\r"

They also restrain the facial skin against gravitational changes, and they delineate the anterior border of the \"jowl\" area. The platysma-auricular ligament is a thin fascial sheet that extends from the posterosuperior border of the platysma and that is intimately attached to the periauricular skin; it serves as a surgical guide to the posterosuperior border of the platysma. The anterior platysma-cutaneous ligaments are variable fascial condensations that anchor the SMAS and platysma to the dermis. They can cause anatomic disorientation with dissection of false planes into the dermis. These four ligaments are useful as anatomic landmarks during facial dissections. The tethering effects of the zygomatic and mandibular ligaments must be interrupted if a maximum upward movement of the facial skin is desired.\r"

Random fasciocutaneous flaps survive 12 to 18 percent longer than skin flaps. Using the radioactive microsphere technique, blood flow was measured after flap elevation, and flap survival was estimated using fluorescein. Again, a significant difference in flap survival was found, but there was no significant difference in measured blood flow. This can be explained by the relatively large interval between blood flow measurements (2 cm) compared with the observed difference in survival length (1.0 +/- 0.3 cm).\r"

To study this phenomenon, a new model employing 54 primate tendons and stereomorphometric image analysis was used to quantitate adhesion volume after a standardized surface injury. Three randomized groups (n = 18 per group) were studied: group I, incision/resection; group II, incision/resection plus ischemia; and group III, ischemia alone. The moving surfaces were observed at intervals from 1 week to 2 1/2 years using dissecting, light, and scanning electron microscopy. Fibroblasts were found to invade the traumatized segment from sources both intrinsic and extrinsic to the tendon, generating adhesive bands whose volume correlated with the degree of initial injury. The defect was ultimately effaced by scar, yet the continuous motion appeared to modify the healing by lengthening adhesive elements and by establishing a smooth, functional \"neosheath\" that coalesced from the overlying soft tissues. This proliferative response occurred in all specimens, peaked during the third week, and limited normal motion in only 12 percent. This model, the first to successfully study such surfaces in primates, also indicates that closure of the tendon sheath is unnecessary.\r"

The factors that contributed to these formulas were print-length factor (PLF), toe-spread factor (TSF), and intermediary toe-spread factor (ITF). It was shown that animals with selective nerve injuries gave walking tracks that were consistent, predictable, and based on known neuromuscular deficits. The new formula for sciatic functional index was compared with previously described indices. The sciatic functional index, tibial functional index, and peroneal functional index offer the peripheral nerve investigator a noninvasive quantitative assessment of hindlimb motor function in the rat with selective hindlimb nerve injury.\r"

The risk of burning human tissue is enhanced when epinephrine is injected for vasoconstriction and the tissue is undermined. In addition, focusing dual lights on the surgical field increases the radiant energy delivered. The maximum radiant energy safe for human tissue should not exceed 25 mW/cm2.\r"

There were no statistically significant differences in the cephalometric angular measurements between the groups. Inside the maxillary periosteal flap group the maxillary growth was more retarded in unilateral and especially bilateral complete clefts than in alveolar clefts only. The maxillary growth seemed to be on average better than in primarily bone-grafted materials. The primary use of periosteum had been abandoned in our unit already in 1974, because it did not fulfill the expectations of prevention of maxillary collapse, lesser need for secondary bone grafting, and better midfacial growth.\r"

The results revealed that the amount of dye in a freshly made flap was rarely as much as in normal skin, and skin with less than 20 percent of the dye of control areas usually sloughed, although there were exceptions. In the future the instrument will be improved, and its readings will be compared to those obtained from radioactive microspheres, the present \"gold standard\" of techniques to measure vascularity. The instrument can be used to estimate the blood supply to any tissue and seems to be as reliable as the dermofluorometers already on the market.\r"

However, as the infant grows older, the flexibility of the auricle decreases. Alar cartilage exhibits the same elasticity as auricular cartilage in the early neonate. When a cleft lip is repaired, typically when the infant is about 3 months of age, it becomes difficult to correct the nasal deformity without surgical intervention. However, based on our experience, there is a fair possibility of correcting the cleft lip nasal deformity with a nonsurgical procedure in the early neonatal period. We performed cleft lip repair accompanied by nonsurgical correction of the nasal deformity in 44 neonates aged 2 to 7 days. A special retainer was placed in the affected nostril for 3 months. Following observation of 31 infants for 12 months or longer, their nasal shapes and symmetry were considered superior to those conventionally operated on at about 3 months of age. Except for one nasal infection, there were no complications.\r"

This powerful optical illusion provides the surgeon with an alternate strategy for creating harmony in the nose with a low, straight dorsum and a disproportionately large nasal base. Instead of reducing the lower nose, the surgeon can augment the upper nose (and make whatever nasal base changes are independently necessary). This alternate strategy limits the amount of nasal skeletal reduction necessary, thereby limiting the potential for postoperative change and soft-tissue distortion and directly increasing the surgeon's control over the result.\r"

Suction lipectomy has become a very popular technique for removing cervical fat because it is easy to perform and results in few complications. This paper describes the en bloc excision of cervical fat in conjunction with rhytidectomy. The senior author has treated 1,000 patients over 17 years using this technique with a high degree of patient satisfaction and minimal morbidity. Although suction lipectomy alone may be indicated for the younger patient, our experience suggests that the en bloc excisional technique is the treatment of choice in the older patient in whom a rhytidectomy is also indicated. In contrast with suction lipectomy, we have found that the en bloc excision of cervical fat allows for more anatomic dissection and facilitates removal of greater amounts of fat and better redraping of the cervical skin.\r"

However, the tissue component(s) that determine the evolution of skin necrosis and the mechanism of this pharmacologic protection are not precisely defined. We have studied freezing injury to rabbit ears by serial biopsies examined by light and electron microscopy. The morphologic evidence of skin injury due to freezing was localized exclusively in the endothelial cells, particularly in the arterioles. Within 1 hour, the entire microvasculature demonstrated endothelial damage. Intravascular platelet aggregation occurred just after thawing and closely paralleled the endothelial cell injury. Very few neutrophils were seen initially (at 10 minutes). By 1 hour, leukocyte aggregates were present, and they further increased at 6 hours. Swelling of the interstitium started 10 minutes after thawing, while extravasation of erythrocytes began to appear by 6 hours. Parenchymal elements of skin were relatively free of damage. In the ear cartilage, the chondrocytes showed evidence of damage immediately after freezing. The administration of superoxide dismutase (SOD) during thawing (reperfusion) did not qualitatively alter any of the initial morphologic changes induced by freezing. We conclude that the endothelial cell is the initial target of injury induced by freezing, an initial injury that is mediated by a non-free-radical-mediated mechanism. It is likely that this acute injury ultimately compromises blood flow and leads to skin necrosis.\r"

The relatively superficial location of the prosthesis, the need for early active motion, previous surgical incisions, and a variety of systemic factors may militate against early wound healing. Restoration of well-vascularized soft-tissue cover can salvage an otherwise disastrous situation. The authors recommend early operative intervention upon observation of wound breakdown, devitalized skin edges, or significant subcutaneous infection leading to necrotic overlying skin. The operative procedure found to salvage the majority of prostheses consists of adequate debridement, antibiotic irrigation (of the joint, if exposed), and coverage with a well-vascularized muscle flap, preferably the medial gastrocnemius muscle. The operative technique and ultimate long-term outcome are reviewed based on experience with 10 consecutive patients presenting with a jeopardized knee prosthesis. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years. Representative case histories are presented.\r"

These prostheses were placed for total-joint replacement or limb salvage surgery. All four prostheses and extremities were salvaged without the need for endoprosthesis removal or exchange, and no infections developed. The results suggest that late aseptic wound dehiscence with an exposed endoprosthesis need not be managed with prosthetic removal, arthrodesis, or amputation. This one-stage procedure avoided infection, allowed early mobilization, and shortened hospitalization.\r"

MR imaging correctly demonstrated fracture in nine of nine patients; the precise configuration of the fracture line was delineated in eight patients. MR imaging was useful in excluding fractures in 14 of 14 patients, who were subsequently followed up clinically for a minimum of 3 months. Radionuclide scans were positive in four of four patients with fractures and equivocal in one patient who was subsequently demonstrated to have no fracture. Additional imaging studies were requested by clinicians in all cases in which the bone scan was positive. The results of this study suggest that MR imaging can provide a rapid, cost-effective, and anatomically precise diagnosis of hip fracture in patients with normal or equivocal initial radiographs. The specificity of the diagnosis achieved can obviate supplemental imaging examinations, with their attendant additional expense and radiation exposure.\r"

Both methods were used to evaluate the lumbar spine in 107 women (aged 35-84 years [mean, 64 years]) referred for evaluation of osteoporosis risk. High correlation was documented between measurements derived by the two techniques, with a .95 linear regression coefficient for the total spine density measurement. Age-related regression equations were similar in slope but manifested different intercepts. Bone mineral density values derived with DRA were consistently lower than those obtained with DPA (conversion equation: DPA density = [1.067 X DRA density] + 0.163). Besides the inherent imperfections of each system, it was found that inaccurate identification of intervertebral spaces on the low-resolution DPA images introduced errors in patient data. DRA may replace DPA as the dedicated projectional densitometric procedure of choice for technical reasons, but at present a conversion equation must be used to compare DRA data to DPA data.\r"

The effect of image compression was studied in radiographs obtained to diagnose subperiosteal bone resorption. Magnification radiographs of 44 hands were digitized to an array size of 4,096 X 4,096 X 12 bits. Selected subregions containing a single middle phalanx were compressed and reconstructed. A subset of the resultant 12-bit uncompressed and 8-, 7-, and 6-bit compressed images were read by four radiologists whose responses were analyzed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) techniques. There were 81 images used in the ROC analysis, of which 48 were normal and 33 showed subperiosteal resorption. No statistically significant loss of diagnostic quality was detected for 8- or 7-bit compressed images, with average compression ratios of 16:1 and 28:1, respectively. Diagnostic quality was lost with 6-bit images, with an average compression ratio of 107:1.\r"

The results were compared with those in published reports of single-energy quantitative CT measurements in healthy subjects and with dual-energy data obtained in studies of healthy premenopausal women and elderly osteopenic women. The trabecular bone mass was moderately decreased in patients with Gaucher disease. The bone marrow fat content was markedly diminished, presumably due to replacement of marrow fat by Gaucher cells. In healthy and osteopenic subjects single-energy quantitative CT values were lowered by the presence of marrow fat. Comparable single-energy measurements in patients with Gaucher disease reflect greater degrees of bone loss. Low levels of marrow fat may prove to be a valuable marker of the severity of marrow disease.\r"

LAG and/or CT influenced Ann Arbor clinical stage (CS) in 39 patients (23%) and Ann Arbor pathologic stage (PS) in 23 patients (14%) by detection of clinically inapparent retroperitoneal adenopathy and/or extranodal disease. LAG findings raised the CS in eight patients and the PS in six of the eight by showing adenopathy when the CT results were negative. By depicting extranodal disease, CT resulted in the CS being raised in an additional ten patients and the PS in six of the ten. Of the diagnostic tests assessed, bone marrow biopsy and/or cytology had the greatest influence on staging. Clinical staging that included LAG/CT resulted in the identification of only 30 patients with CS IV disease, whereas an additional 53 CS I through CS III patients had their disease stage raised to PS IV due to positive bone marrow biopsy/cytology results. However, 42 of the 53 patients already had advanced (CS III) disease. Initial case management was influenced by LAG, CT, or bone marrow biopsy/cytology results in 27 of 168 patients. LAG/CT results influenced management in 20 of 27 cases, while bone marrow biopsy/cytology results caused initial management changes in only seven of the 27 cases.\r"

Maximum splenic opacification occurred immediately after injection; 1 g/kg, which allowed an immediate enhancement of +35 HU, appeared sufficient for the diagnosis of splenic conditions. Vascular opacification was insufficient for diagnostic purposes. In four patients with metastases, more lesions were seen with the use of PFOB with CT than with conventional CT. Adverse effects included five cases of low back pain that were reversible when the infusion rate was reduced. Fever and trembling were also noted 6 hours after injection in five patients. In all patients, symptoms regressed spontaneously within several hours.

Computed tomography was used to determine presence and distribution of calcium. One stone from each set was either chemically analyzed, mechanically fragmented with the laser, or left intact. Fragmented and intact stones were subjected to MTBE dissolution for 12 hours or until fragments were 2 mm or less in diameter. All five laser-treated, noncalcified gallstones dissolved completely, compared with four of five intact stones. All six laser-treated, calcified gallstones dissolved completely, compared with only one of six intact stones. The solitary calcified common bile duct stone, whether fragmented or intact, did not completely dissolve. Speed of dissolution was significantly faster for laser-treated stones (P = .04). The authors conclude that laser fragmentation of gallstones increases the speed of subsequent MTBE dissolution and allows successful dissolution of calcified gallstones.\r"

A total of ten intrahepatic abscesses also were drained in these patients.

Volumetric pixel analysis revealed significantly larger subarachnoid space volumes in patients than in control subjects, without a significant difference in ventricular volumes. No other intracranial abnormalities were found in any IIH patient or control subject. The results suggest that, in IIH, (a) although the subarachnoid spaces are enlarged, the wide range of normal values would limit the clinical use of these measurements and (b) the role of MR imaging, as with CT, is primarily in the exclusion of other diseases with clinical presentations similar to that of IIH.\r"

Findings from MR images generally correlated well with the histologic extent of untreated tumors in white matter; the heterogeneous appearance of glioblastomas multiforme distinguished them from less malignant gliomas. Subpial spread and tumor in the subarachnoid space were not visualized. The extent of tumors in remission was overestimated on MR images because of the extensive surrounding edema and radiation necrosis.

Gd-DTPA also demonstrated one dural AVF not detected on precontrast images. Regions of cord ischemia or infarction related to spinal dural AVF also enhanced in three patients. Advantages of Gd-DTPA include the demonstration of small isointense intramedullary tumors and the ability to permit differentiation of tumor from adjacent cord syrinx and solid tumor from postoperative gliosis and arachnoid scarring.

  ".W": "Magnetic resonance (MR) images of 68 patients examined for adenomas of the pituitary gland were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of hyperintensity on T1-weighted images because of recent reports suggesting that bromocriptine treatment may affect T1 values. Twenty-seven patients were examined after either surgery or radiation therapy, 29 were receiving bromocriptine, and 22 had not received any treatment at the time of MR imaging. MR imaging criteria showed evidence of subacute or chronic intratumoral hemorrhage in 18 patients, five of whom had hemorrhage proved at surgery. Ten of the 18 patients were asymptomatic from the hemorrhage; eight had headaches, visual field cuts, or cranial nerve deficits. Although an increased frequency of intratumoral hemorrhage was noted in prolactinomas and macroadenomas and in patients undergoing bromocriptine therapy, the effect of bromocriptine on bleeding was the only significant correlation (P less than .01).\r"

With this coil system, there is no restriction on placement or design of coils to prevent interaction. When combined with three-dimensional imaging techniques, switched coils allow simultaneous bilateral acquisition of multiple, contiguous sections through paired anatomic structures in a reasonable amount of imaging time.\r"

  ".U": "89072110\r", 
  ".W": "Patterns of flow-related signal loss and enhancement have been observed in fluid moving perpendicular to the imaging plane on multi-section-acquisition magnetic resonance images. These patterns depend on whether the flow is in the same direction (cocurrent) or opposite (countercurrent) to the direction of sequential section excitation. For a given velocity, flow-related enhancement penetrates deeper into the imaging volume with countercurrent flow than with cocurrent flow. The signal intensity of inner sections is generally greater with countercurrent flow than with cocurrent flow and depends on the velocity. These effects were investigated quantitatively with phantom studies and correlated with theoretical predictions. It was found that the limited penetration of flow-related enhancement with cocurrent flow is a consequence of recently saturated upstream protons flowing into the section to be excited. The flow-related enhancement penetrates farther with countercurrent flow, because inflowing spins have had a greater period of time to recover from the saturating effect of the radio-frequency pulse. Because different laminae have different time intervals to recover magnetization, this also accounts for the observation of concentric rings representing laminar flow in the countercurrent direction.\r"

The cylinders appeared within 4 minutes from the start of contrast medium injection and remained distinct for 35-50 minutes. The diameter of the cylinders varied between 0.05 and 0.30 mm; their course was almost straight and closely followed the shape of the pyramid.

This procedure was attempted on 14 occasions and successfully accomplished on 12. In 11 of these cases, retrograde catheterization obviated PCN to provide renal drainage for a partially obstructing ureteral stricture or obstructing renal calculi, to remove ureteral calculi, or to insert a new ureteral stent after an unsuccessful attempt to exchange an existing occluded retrograde ureteral stent. The procedure also obviated Whitaker testing. On one occasion the retrograde procedure greatly facilitated subsequent PCN in an obese patient with faintly opaque calyceal calculi. These procedures were accomplished with standard angiographic equipment and, in many instances, Teflon sheaths in the bowel conduit to stabilize catheters and guide wires. No complications were encountered. The two patients whose ureters could not be catheterized in retrograde fashion subsequently required PCN.\r"

In premenopausal women, radiation therapy induced (a) a decrease in uterine size demonstrable as early as 3 months after therapy ended; (b) a decrease in signal intensity of the myometrium on T2-predominant MR images, reflecting a significant decrease in T2 relaxation time, demonstrable as early as 1 month after therapy; (c) a decrease in thickness and signal intensity of the endometrium demonstrable on T2-predominant images 6 months after therapy; and (d) loss of uterine zonal anatomy as early as 3 months after therapy. In postmenopausal women, irradiation did not significantly alter the MR imaging appearance of the uterus. These postirradiation MR changes in both the premenopausal and postmenopausal uteri appeared similar to the changes ordinarily seen on MR images of the nonirradiated postmenopausal uterus.\r"

All patients in both groups received similar pre- and postangiographic treatment. A greater number of patients in the ionic group had preexisting renal disease, were of advanced age, and had received large volumes of contrast material. Acute renal dysfunction occurred in 20 of the 202 (10%) patients in the ionic group, compared with eight of the 145 (5.5%) patients in the nonionic group; this difference is not statistically significant. Five patients in the ionic group, but none of the patients in the nonionic group, ultimately required dialysis; this difference is not statistically significant.

In another four women, retroglandular prostheses became calcified. In women who received free-silicone injections, coarse calcifications developed in three, and gross nodularity with calcified silicone granulomas developed in one. Five palpable masses developed, three of which were malignant; four masses were in breasts augmented with a retroglandular prosthesis, and they could not be detected with mammography. The mass that developed in a woman with a subpectoral prosthesis could be seen at mammography. The only nonpalpable malignancy detected with mammography was in a breast with a retroglandular prosthesis and contained microcalcifications.

Radiographs revealed fine reticular or reticulonodular infiltrates in the pulmonary interstitium in five patients, coarse reticulonodular infiltrates in two, and reticular or reticulonodular opacities with superimposed patchy alveolar infiltrates in nine. Pathologic examination of biopsy specimens revealed lymphocytes, plasma cells, and reticulum cells aggregated about the small arteries and compressing the distal airways. Throughout the course of AIDS or ARC, the radiographic findings of LIP remained stable in 12 of 16 patients. AIDS/ARC-related LIP appears to be a benign reaction of bronchial-associated lymphatic tissue to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, this indolent process cannot be correctly diagnosed based on radiographic findings alone; the use of lung biopsy is required to differentiate LIP from other infections. The authors suggest that patients with these radiographic findings, HIV seropositivity, but no other signs of opportunistic infection or neoplasia should be classified as having AIDS.\r"

Two infants with renal parenchymal damage had abnormal radionuclide scans and abnormal corticomedullary distinction on MR images. The major role of MR imaging may be in the early course of these conditions, when added diagnostic specificity is likely to affect patient management. In most instances, size of hemorrhage and intravenous clots, as well as renal size, may be accurately followed with US, while radionuclide scanning remains necessary for evaluation of renal functional impairment.\r"

Compared with pluridirectional arthrotomography, computed arthrotomography provided additional information in two of five (40%) cases. In the remaining three cases, computed arthrotomography and pluridirectional arthrotomography provided equal information. In no case did pluridirectional arthrotomography provide additional information. Computed arthrotomography was useful in demonstrating loose bodies, differentiating air bubbles from loose bodies, and determining the intra- or extraarticular location of ossific densities. Computed arthrotomography appears to be a useful adjunct to arthrography in detecting loose bodies and in evaluating anatomically complex cases.\r"

  ".W": "From November 1986 through October 1987, 71 patients received a continent intestinal reservoir at the Mississippi Baptist Medical Center. The mean age was 37 years (a range of 13 to 65 years). Coloproctectomy was necessary because of ulcerative colitis in 60, Crohn's colitis in eight and familial polyposis in three. A conventional ileostomy was converted to a continent intestinal reservoir in 54, while 13 received a continent intestinal reservoir at the time of the coloproctectomy. In four, the continent intestinal reservoir was constructed after removal of an ileoanal J pouch. Operative maneuvers of importance during valve construction included an intestinal collar, an isoperistaltic valve, stapling of the valve and electrocautery scarification of the serosa. Two patients experienced valve dessusception. The over-all operative revision rate for valve and pouch problems was 7 per cent. There were no deaths and no reservoirs have been removed. An improved quality of life was reported by almost all of those patients converted from a conventional ileostomy. The continent intestinal reservoir represents an attractive option for certain patients after coloproctectomy.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective study of diverticular disease of the appendix was made in 3,343 consecutive instances of appendectomies. A 2 per cent incidence of diverticular disease was found. These instances were classified into four morphologic types: 1, acute diverticulitis; 2, acute appendicitis with acute diverticulitis; 3, acute appendicitis with diverticulum, and 4, appendix with diverticulum. Types 1, 2 and 3 were divided into subgroups with or without perforation. The elements of clinical behavior in each group were examined in detail. Diverticulitis of the appendix is presented as a clinically variant form of the inflamed appendix. Some followed the pattern of typical acute appendicitis. However, most were distinctive at a later age of onset, longer interval of disease, fewer or absent symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract, failure of typical abdominal pain progression, delay in surgical treatment and a remarkably high incidence of perforation. In a chi-square analysis of 56 patients with acute diverticulitis of the appendix compared with 2,503 patients with acute appendicitis, more than a fourfold incidence of perforation in acute diverticulitis was significant beyond the 0.001 level. These findings of variant behavior and high incidence of perforation are cautionary features of this frequently overlooked disease.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-six consecutive patients with massive tissue necrosis resulting from acute pancreatitis were initially managed nonoperatively. In each instance, a mass of necrotic tissue, bathed in fluid, became evident. Laparotomy was delayed unless a life-threatening complication developed. In no instance did the \"cavitary necrosis\" disappear prior to laparotomy. In five patients, laparotomy was avoided and a chronic pseudocyst evolved. Thirty-one patients required laparotomy, usually after a lapse of one to two months. The necrotic tissue was always retroperitoneal and was clearly demarcated from viable tissue. In most instances, the necrotic tissue was predominantly retroperitoneal adipose tissue. Under such conditions, the anatomic definition of the pancreas, per se, was not practical. The preoperative and operative diagnosis of secondary infection of the necrotic tissue was often difficult. The operation consisted of necrosectomy (debridement) and external drainage. The amount of necrotic tissue was often in excess of 1 kilogram. When necrosectomy was incomplete, secondary explorations and debridement were sometimes necessary. In retrospect, in only a few instances did necrosis and necrosectomy appear to have resulted in the loss of an appreciable amount of pancreatic tissue. One of the 36 patients died, giving a mortality rate that compares favorably with reports of earlier operative intervention.\r"

The patient population was young, ranging in age from 19 to 45 years; seven were men and six were women. The presumed cause was the use of oral contraceptives in three, polycythemia rubra vera in two, Behcet disease in one patient and unknown in seven patients. All of the 13 patients had abdominal pain, marked ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, wasting and disturbed liver function. Diagnosis was based on the symptoms and signs: angiographic demonstration of hepatic vein occlusion and a patent inferior vena cava; pressure measurements that showed an inferior vena caval pressure that was normal or within the usual range for patients with massive ascites and an elevated wedged hepatic vein pressure that was much higher than the inferior vena caval pressure, and the results of biopsy of the liver showing centrilobular congestion and necrosis. Side to side portacaval shunt was very effective in decompressing the liver, reducing the mean corrected portal pressure from 240 millimeters of saline solution before to 7 millimeters of saline solution after the shunt. Operative survival rate was 92 per cent, and the long term survival rate for three to 16 years is 85 per cent. All of the survivors are free of ascites without requiring diuretic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed our experience with 73 patients who had Crohn's disease and underwent local anorectal surgical procedures for perianal suppurative disease during a ten year period. All but one of these patients had intestinal granulomatous disease. The average length of follow-up study was 4.6 years. By using conservative, local anorectal surgical procedures and intensive medical treatment, we were able to establish adequate drainage of abscesses, reduce the inflammatory process and relieve symptoms. Extensive drainage procedures were avoided to preserve the anal sphincter. A sliding endorectal flap repair provided satisfactory results for rectovaginal fistulas and anterior anal fistulas. Proctectomy was eventually necessary in nine patients, the primary indication being severe perianal disease in five. By performing complete excision of the perineal disease at the time of proctectomy, we were able to achieve primary healing of the perineal wound in eight of these patients. Patients were classified according to five categories of results: healed after initial local treatment, eight patients; healed after more than one local treatment, 30 patients; incomplete healing with acceptable condition, 17 patients; healed after fecal diversion, nine patients, and required proctectomy, nine patients. The majority of patients with Crohn's disease and anal and perianal suppurative disease can be managed by meticulous drainage of sepsis and preservation of the anal sphincter.\r"

Eighty-one patients had tumors distal to the inferior pulmonary vein and had en bloc dissections, while the remaining 29 had midthoracic tumors, which required a two-rib thoracotomy. There were 73 men and 37 women with a median age of 64 years (a range of 40 to 75 years). The postoperative mortality rate was 2.7 per cent, and morbidity, mainly caused by respiratory complications, occurred in 21 patients (19 per cent), with no patients requiring ventilatory support. There were no anastomotic leaks. Adequate analgesia was provided by the use of a subpleural catheter delivering a continuous infusion of bupivacaine. The left thoracotomy provides an effective method for undertaking esophageal resections with low mortality and morbidity rates. This approach should be more widely used in the surgical management of patients with intrathoracic esophageal tumors.\r"

We did not perform a gastrotomy or an enterotomy to achieve the desired end to end or end to side anastomosis, thus avoiding another site to be closed later. In its single application, the EEA stapler gives a double layer of staggered staples, which results in a uniform and satisfactory healing. The removal of a ring of tissue with a central core, with examination for its completeness, assures a satisfactory anastomosis. The completed anastomosis can be examined under vision for any bleeding. As a final step, a TA 90 stapler is used at the desired line of transection of the stomach. This method of intestinal anastomosis shortens the operative time and creates a better anastomosis. We have performed these procedures upon 33 patients with good results.\r"

CAPS tested the feasibility of performing a larger study to determine if suppression of ventricular ectopic activity after acute myocardial infarction could improve survival. Patients in CAPS were followed for 1 year. All death or cardiac arrest events were evaluated by at least 2 investigators using a classification scheme that characterized the underlying mechanism as cardiac arrhythmic, cardiac nonarrhythmic or noncardiac. Forty-five patients (9%) died or had cardiac arrest during the 1-year follow-up, 29 (64%) within 1 hour from the onset of symptoms and 16 greater than 1 hour from the onset of symptoms. Twenty-three deaths (51%) were classified as arrhythmic, 19 (42%) as nonarrhythmic and 3 (7%) as noncardiac. Acute myocardial ischemia or infarction was associated with the death/cardiac arrest event in 16 patients (36%), 8 in the arrhythmic death group. Discrepancies in classification among reviewers were particularly common in patients with long-standing symptoms of congestive heart failure, in whom it was frequently difficult to identify the precise moment of the onset of symptoms in the death/cardiac arrest event. Using only the temporal relation of symptoms to categorize deaths or cardiac arrests, the mechanism of 12 (27%) of the 45 patients was in disagreement with the classification based on the Events Committee review. Classification of death as sudden or nonsudden is not equivalent to the classification of death as arrhythmic or nonarrhythmic.\r"

  ".W": "Exercise-induced ischemia is generally attributed to an increase in myocardial demand in the presence of coronary stenosis limiting flow supply. An additional mechanism--the occurrence of coronary steal due to excessive endogenous adenosine release--has also been hypothesized. The effect of adenosine receptor blocking by aminophylline in effort ischemia was tested in 8 patients with stable effort-induced angina pectoris, reproducible positive exercise stress tests and angiographically assessed coronary artery disease. Following double-blind, randomized intravenous infusion of aminophylline (3 mg/kg over 3 minutes) or placebo (20 ml of saline over 3 minutes), the patients underwent upright bicycle exercise stress tests on 2 consecutive days. After aminophylline, there was an increase in work tolerance (aminophylline 7.5 +/- 1.8 minutes of exercise vs placebo 5.4 +/- 1.5 minutes; p less than 0.05). There was a parallel increase in the ischemic threshold, evaluated with the rate-pressure product (mm Hg X beats/min X 100(-2)) at 0.1 mV of ST-segment depression (221 +/- 35 vs 184 +/- 20; p less than 0.01). Thus, at a dosage that should effectively inhibit adenosine receptors, aminophylline infusion exerts a beneficial effect on exercise-induced ischemia, possibly through the prevention of myocardial flow maldistribution elicited by excessive adenosine release during effort.\r"

Hyperventilation produced a positive response in 83% (25 of 30) and ergonovine in 93% (28 of 30) of the patients. After hyperventilation 22 of 25 showed ST-segment elevation, 2 ST depression and 1 T-wave pseudonormalization; after ergonovine ST-segment elevation developed in 23 patients, ST depression in 4 and T-wave pseudonormalization in 1. In all cases the electrocardiographic changes occurred in the same leads as during the spontaneous attacks. The incidence of chest pain and ventricular arrhythmias was similar during both tests; spontaneous remission of ischemia, however, was more frequent (48 vs 14%) after hyperventilation than after ergonovine. Acute ischemia developed at a mean of 218 +/- 112 seconds after the end of hyperventilation in 19 of 25 positive tests; at that time double product was not significantly different from basal values. The sensitivity of hyperventilation was similar (95 vs 100%) to ergonovine in the patients with greater than or equal to 1 daily attack, while in those with less than 1 daily attack the sensitivity of hyperventilation decreased to 55% compared to 77% with ergonovine. Thus, in variant angina the sensitivity of both tests correlates with disease activity. Hyperventilation is a safe provocative test with a sensitivity similar to ergonovine in patients with active disease; however, in patients with sporadic attacks hyperventilation has a lower sensitivity than ergonovine and therefore a limited diagnostic value.\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether coronary occlusion causing transmural ischemia was accurately reflected by ST-segment elevation on routine electrocardiograms, intracoronary and surface electrocardiograms were simultaneously recorded during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The study group consisted of 54 patients who had intracoronary ST-segment elevation during transient coronary occlusion (left anterior descending [LAD]: 25 patients, left circumflex [LC]: 19 patients, right coronary artery: 12 patients). Elevation of the ST segment on the surface electrocardiogram (greater than or equal to 0.1 mV) was recorded in 84% of patients during LAD dilatation, in 32% of patients during LC dilatation (p less than 0.01 vs LAD and right), and in 92% of patients during right coronary dilatation (not significant vs LAD). The magnitude of intracoronary ST elevation was 1.10 +/- 0.8, 1.68 +/- 1.2 and 0.8 +/- 0.6 mV for the LAD, LC and right occlusions, respectively (not significant). Thus, despite the comparable magnitude of intracoronary ST elevation, LC occlusion resulted in ST-segment elevation on the surface electrocardiogram in significantly fewer patients than did LAD or right occlusion. During LC occlusion, 9 patients had no electrocardiographic changes and 4 had only precordial ST depression. Thus, in patients with transmural ischemia during right or LAD occlusions, concordant ST elevation on the surface electrocardiogram is common. In contrast, ST-segment elevation is an insensitive marker of LC occlusion. In patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms and isolated precordial ST depression or no repolarization abnormalities, LC occlusion should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\r"

The success rate and incidences of urgent bypass surgery, acute myocardial infarction, transient azotemia and procedure-related death were not different in the 2 groups.

Angiographic follow-up was available for 308 patients (62%) at a mean of 7.3 +/- 3.4 months after PTCA. One dilated site was randomly chosen per procedure. One hundred and one sites had documented restenosis (greater than or equal to 50% mean diameter stenosis from multiple projections) by quantitative angiography (33% of all sites restudied and 20% of all sites dilated). Twenty-eight morphologic variables and 20 other angiographic, clinical and procedural variables were analyzed by an observer blinded to clinical outcome. Univariate analysis found post-PTCA percent stenosis greater than 30% (p = 0.005), bend point location (p = 0.01), post-PTCA gradient greater than 15 mm Hg (p = 0.02), angina class III to IV (p = 0.03), age (p = 0.04) and the absence of dissection (p = 0.04) to predict restenosis. Multivariate analysis found only 2 significant (p less than 0.05) independent predictors of restenosis: post-PTCA percent stenosis greater than 30% and bend point location. Restenosis occurred in 41% of lesions located at an end-diastolic vessel angle greater than or equal to 45 degrees compared with 28% in lesions on lesser bends. Thus, only 1 predilatation morphologic characteristic, stenosis location at a bend point, was an important independent predictor of restenosis, and should be considered when assessing patients for PTCA.\r"

Likewise, the exercise lead placement ECG cannot substitute for the standard ECG due to significant errors in the former's diagnostic interpretation. This study compares the ECGs recorded via standard and exercise sites regarding frontal and horizontal plane axes, diagnosis and location of myocardial infarction and estimation of infarct size using the complete 54-criteria and 32-point Selvester QRS scoring system. The altered limb lead locations on the exercise ECG caused the QRS vectors to artifactually appear to be directed more inferiorly, posteriorly and rightward, producing a marked rightward mean frontal plane axis shift of +48 degrees (p less than 0.00001). No false positive or false negative anterior infarct was seen on the exercise lead placement ECG, whereas inferior and posterior infarcts were lost in 69% and 31% of patients, respectively. A false lateral infarct was seen in 19% of patients. Estimation of infarct size differed between the 2 ECG sets, with 11 patients increasing their infarct size by 3 to 9% and 14 others decreasing it by 3 to 15% on the exercise lead placement ECG. This study demonstrates that use of body torso positions for limb leads results in substantial QRS waveform variations that disqualify the exercise lead placement ECG as a \"standard\" recording. Such ECGs should therefore be labeled as \"torso positioned\" or \"nonstandard\" to prevent misuse for clinical and investigative purposes.\r"

Measurements of HR were obtained at 9 different sampling intervals (1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60 seconds) at rest and 7 different sampling intervals (1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 15 and 20 seconds) during the last 30 seconds of each minute during exercise. The HR obtained from each interval was compared with true HR (determined by a 4-minute sample at rest and by the last 30 seconds of each minute during exercise). Among patients with AF, large differences were observed between the HR obtained and true HR, both at rest and during exercise, using small sampling intervals. The mean of these differences ranged between 16 +/- 11 beats/min (range 14 to 22) using 1-second sampling intervals and 2.2 +/- 2.0 beats/min (range 1.6 to 4.4) using 20-second sampling intervals during progressive exercise. Variability of the HR obtained from a given random sample was also high when short sampling intervals were used among patients with AF. These observations were contrasted by subjects in normal sinus rhythm, among whom neither variability nor measurement error were influenced remarkably by changing the sampling interval or increasing HR.\r"

One VPC introduced from the right ventricle into narrow QRS RT when the His bundle was refractory resulted in retrograde atrial preexcitation in 25 of 55 (45%) patients, while 30 (55%) showed no preexcitation. Double VPCs produced retrograde atrial preexcitation in 9 of 26 patients not responding to a single VPC. No difference in RT cycle length, AH, HV or ventriculoatrial intervals was found between those patients who did or did not show retrograde atrial preexcitation. The response to single and double VPCs during RT was related to the location of the AP. The average distance of the AP from the crux determined by intraoperative epicardial mapping in the 41 patients who underwent surgery was 2.7 +/- 0.7 mapping units (left posterolateral region) in patients showing retrograde atrial preexcitation with a single VPC, 3.6 +/- 0.7 units (at the lateral left ventricular margin) in those responding to double VPCs and 4.3 +/- 0.8 units (beyond the LV margin) in those showing no response. Left bundle--branch block (LBBB) aberrancy during RT resulted in an average 60 +/- 14 ms prolongation of the ventriculoatrial interval in 40 patients, including 5 in whom LBBB was seen only after procainamide infusion. VPCs introduced into LBBB RT resulted in significant retrograde atrial preexcitation in 6 additional patients in whom no response during normal QRS RT was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Group 1 comprised 12 patients with vasodepressor syncope, group 2 had 8 patients with syncope of unknown origin, group 3 included 11 patients with syncope due to seizures in 2 and ventricular tachycardia in 9, group 4 had 17 patients with various arrhythmias not associated with syncope. Isoproterenol boluses were administered starting at 2 micrograms and increased in 2-micrograms steps to a maximum of 8 micrograms at 0 degree and +60 degrees. The responses at 0 degrees were all normal. At +60 degrees a vasodepressor reaction consisting of syncope or near syncope, hypotension and bradycardia was produced by isoproterenol (mean dose 6.0 +/- 0.26 micrograms) in 8 patients from group 1 (66.6%), 4 from group 2 (50%), 0 from group 3 and 4 from group 4 (23.5%). Three of the 4 patients in group 4 had a remote history of classic vasodepressor syncope. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the test were 73 and 85%, respectively, while the predictive accuracy of a test with positive or negative outcome were 69 and 89%, respectively. Muscarinic receptor blockade with atropine in 4 patients prevented isoproterenol-induced bradycardia but not hypotension or symptoms of fainting. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol inhibited all aspects of the isoproterenol-induced faint. Thus, the administration of isoproterenol during a passive upright tilt may identify persons who suffer from or are prone to a vasodepressor reaction.\r"

  ".W": "This study assessed the temporal relation of RR interval, AH interval and systemic blood pressure changes during induced symptomatic bradycardia-hypotension episodes in 14 patients with recurrent syncope suspected of being neurally mediated. Upright tilt with isoproterenol reproduced symptoms in 9 of 14 patients (positive response) and was negative in 5 of 14 (negative response). Isoproterenol alone shortened supine RR intervals in all patients. With tilt, however, isoproterenol prolonged RR intervals in those with positive results (supine 519 +/- 124 ms vs tilt 845 +/- 212 ms, p less than 0.005) while further shortening RR intervals among negative responders (supine 436 +/- 90 ms vs tilt 377 +/- 82 ms, p less than 0.05). Similarly, tilt with isoproterenol prolonged AH intervals in patients with positive responses despite RR prolongation, while shortening AH in negative responders. Additionally, with combined tilt and isoproterenol, systemic arterial pressure decreased significantly in patients with positive responses (systolic 99 +/- 13 vs 57 +/- 13 mm Hg, p less than 0.001, diastolic 62 +/- 17 vs 28 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) but not in patients with negative responses. Further, onset of hypotension (42 +/- 14 seconds after tilt) preceded onset of RR interval prolongation (52 +/- 23 seconds after tilt). Syncope (142 +/- 72 seconds after tilt) coincided closely with nadir of systemic pressure (136 +/- 74 seconds) and both tended to precede maximum RR prolongation (152 +/- 87 seconds). Thus, the bradycardia and hypotension associated with neurally mediated syncope exhibit characteristic but distinctly different time courses, with arterial pressure changes developing earlier and coinciding more closely with symptom development.\r"

The Rotablator consists of a 1.25 to 4.5 mm diameter oblong burr with tiny diamond blades mounted on a flexible shaft, which tracks over a spring-tip guidewire and rotates at speeds greater than 120,000 rpm. All stenoses were reduced to less than or equal to 50% of the normal luminal diameter. No significant complications occurred. Of the 6 patients having the atherectomy procedure, 5 were reevaluated by duplex Doppler measurements 1.5 to 5.5 (mean 3.5) months after atherectomy and found to be patient with only mild residual flow disturbance. Repeat follow-up by angiography after a mean of 5.2 months, however, showed only 3 (37%) of the atherectomized segments in 3 patients to still be patent. All were symptomatically improved. Of the effluent particles analyzed, 90% were less than 8 microns in size, while only 5% reached 250 microns. With improvements in technique, the largest particles were 150 to 180 microns, constituting only 1.4% of effluent debris. Samples of the effluent from 2 patients were injected in vivo into the left coronary system of 2 pigs. There were no acute hemodynamic or electrocardiographic complications or pathologic evidence of muscle necrosis or vascular thrombosis 18 to 48 hours later. These preliminary results with respect to feasibility and safety of the Rotablator are promising.\r"

All were male. This study assesses by means of echocardiography the responses to exercise of left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction and segmental LV contractility in these subjects. Exertional hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure to below the resting value at the end of stress test. Supine systolic blood pressure after exercise was significantly greater in the control group than in the study group (179 vs 121 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.001); there was no significant intra- or intergroup difference in the resting values. In the study group end-systolic volume was 37 ml at rest and 35 ml after exercise; ejection fraction varied from 65% at rest to 63% after exercise. The sex- and age-matched control group with a normal systolic blood pressure response to exercise showed a shift from 35 to 23 ml and 65 to 77%, respectively (p less than 0.01 and 0.001). Ejection fraction correlated well with radionuclide angiography values. Exertional hypotension was noted after both upright and supine exercise. The pattern of regional wall motion remained unchanged or was hypokinetic in 87% of the subjects; only 13% presented the normally expected hyperkinesia after exercise. This study demonstrates that exertional hypotension is accompanied by an abnormal LV performance.\r"

  ".W": "The traditional method for calculating risk in prospective and retrospective studies is based on the assumption that the study population is homogeneous. Risk is therefore estimated as an overall average for the entire population, when in fact some individuals may be at high risk and others at little or no risk. This paper introduces an alternate approach to risk estimation. The calculations are equally simple and utilize the same data. Yet, the new approach allows for heterogeneity and can detect it when it exists. The new method was applied to HIV seroconversion data from a follow-up study, age-at-onset distribution for Huntington disease, and age-specific prevalence of insulin-treated diabetes. These analyses were intended to demonstrate both applicability of the method to different types of data and the accuracy of the estimates when compared with the known parameters. The HIV analysis predicted a high-risk subgroup constituting about 17% of the cohort. This estimate closely approximates the actual 16% who reportedly engaged in high-risk activities and had a 15-fold higher seroconversion rate than the rest of the cohort. There is no evidence from genetic linkage studies for heterogeneity in Huntington disease. The present results, however, suggested that 14%-18% of individuals who are susceptible to the disease have a much lower risk than others. Diabetes data was chosen because the model is clearly too simplistic for this disease, and the analysis did reveal lack of fit of the model.\r"

In 87 cells the rec(9) had one Cd-positive primary constriction. In 13 cells the rec(9) had two primary constrictions; in 12 of these cells there was one Cd-positive centromere, and in one of these cells both primary constrictions were Cd-positive. Nuclear projections were observed in 10% of fibroblast interphase cells harvested in situ, suggesting that there was some spindle-fiber activity of the \"latent\" centromere.

  ".W": "The gene for human apolipoprotein C2 (APOC2), situated on the proximal long arm of chromosome 19, is closely linked to the gene for the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy (DM). Six APOC2 RFLPs (TaqI, BglI, BanI, BamHI, NcoI, and AvaII) have been identified to date. We have conducted a comprehensive DM linkage study utilizing all six RFLPs and involving 50 families and 372 individuals. The most informative RFLPs are, in descending order, NcoI (lod = 6.64, theta = 0.05), BglI (lod = 6.12, theta = 0.05), AvaII (lod = 6.02, theta = 0.03), BanI (lod = 5.76, theta = 0.04), TaqI (lod = 4.29, theta = 0.06), and BamHI (lod = 1.75, theta = 0.01). A substantial increase in the lod scores over those seen with the individual RFLPs was obtained when the linkage of the entire APOC2 haplotype (composed of the six RFLPs) was studied (lod = 17.87, theta = 0.04). We have observed significant inter-APOC2 RFLP linkage disequilibrium. Consequently, the three most informative RFLPs have been found to be BanI, TaqI, and either BglI, AvaII, or NcoI polymorphisms. We also demonstrate linkage disequilibrium between DM and APOC2 in our French-Canadian population (standardized disequilibrium constant phi = .22, chi 2 = 5.12, df = 1, P less than 0.04). This represents the first evidence of linkage disequilibrium between APOC2 and the DM locus.\r"

  ".W": "Isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting reveals considerable biochemical and genetic variation in the C1R subcomponent of the first complement component. The nature of the intraindividual biochemical variation can be explained by differences in sialic acid content because after digestion with neuraminidase the terminal sialic acids are removed to yield a single major band corresponding to the C1R polypeptide. Plasma samples from a large number of different ethnic groups, consisting of U.S. whites, U.S. blacks, Nigerian blacks, and Inuit, Aleut, and Amerindian populations from the Western Hemisphere have revealed genetically determined charge variation with heterozygous phenotypes consisting of two major asialo bands, indicating that the underlying variation is not due to variation in sialic acid content. Two previously reported common alleles, C1R*1 and CIR*2, have been observed in all studied populations, the notable exception being the Dogrib Indian population, which is devoid of the C1R*2 allele. Several new alleles--designated C1R*3, C1R*4, C1R*5, C1R*6, and C1R*7-have been observed, with variable frequencies ranging from the occurrence in a single individual and related family members to the polymorphic occurrence of certain alleles in several populations. Of these new alleles, the C1R*5 is of considerable interest in population and anthropological genetics studies. The C1R*5 allele is widely distributed, at a frequency of .03 to .17, in all of the North American aboriginal populations screened. This allele is not present in U.S. whites but is present at a polymorphic frequency in U.S. and Nigerian blacks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A recent study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphism has generated much debate about modern human origins by proposing the existence of an \"African Eve\" living 200,000 years ago somewhere in Africa. In an attempt to synthesize information concerning human mtDNA genetic polymorphism, all available data on mtDNA RFLP have been gathered. A phylogeny of the mtDNA types found in 10 populations reveals that all types could have issued from a single common ancestral type. The distribution of shared types between continental groups indicates that caucasoid populations could be the closest to an ancestral population from which all other continental groups would have diverged. A partial phylogeny of the types found in five other populations also demonstrates that the myth of an African Eden was based on an incorrect \"genealogical tree\" of mtDNA types. Two measures of molecular diversity have been computed on all samples on the basis of mtDNA type frequencies, on one hand, and on the basis of the number of polymorphic sites in the samples, on the other. A large discrepancy is found between the two measures except in African populations; this suggests the existence of some differential selective mechanisms. The lapse of time necessary for creating the observed molecular diversity from an ancestral monomorphic population has been calculated and is found generally greater in Oriental and caucasoid populations. Implications concerning human mtDNA evolution are discussed.\r"

Analysis of these data has revealed that the defect is primarily genetic, which is in agreement with earlier findings. Segregation analysis was performed to compare various autosomal diallelic one-locus and multilocus models. Our analysis revealed that the most parsimonious model for prelingual deafness is that it is controlled by recessive genes at a pair of unlinked diallelic autosomal loci. Individuals are affected if and only if they are recessive homozygous at both loci. The likelihood of the present data under this two-locus multiple recessive homozygosis model is at least 10(8) times higher than that of the one-locus models that were examined in previous studies. This model is also the best-fitting model among other plausible two-locus models.\r"

Of these, 18 per cent were larvae, 80 per cent were nymphs, and 2 per cent were adults. An I. dammini encounter distance, defined as the mean number of meters traveled before encountering a nymphal or adult I. dammini on a drag cloth, ranged from 36 m in high-risk parks, to infinity (no tick encounters). Generally, areas of high use presented higher encounter distances (lower risk) than those of the entire park. Two of the three parks with the highest annual attendance also had the highest I. dammini population indices as projected from our sampling regimen. These results indicate that recreational parks in Lyme disease endemic areas represent a substantial human risk for tick bites and Lyme disease.\r"

Smoothed proportions of women with recent preventive care were estimated using weighted least squares for subgroups categorized by age (20-39, 40-59, 60-79), race (White, Black), income (poor, nonpoor), and year of interview. Older women and Black women experienced the largest increases in recent use of clinical breast examinations and Pap tests. Between 1973 and 1985 changes in recent breast examination ranged from zero for White women ages 20-39 years to a 23 percentage point increase (95% CI = 17,30) for Black women ages 60-79 years. A similar pattern was found for Pap testing. Changes between 1974 and 1985 in recent blood pressure testing ranged from zero for women ages 20-39 years to an 8 percentage point increase (95% CI = 6, 10) for women ages 60-79 years. Despite the increases among older women, in 1985 recent use of breast exams and Pap tests remained lower among older women. Further, the poor remained less likely than the nonpoor to have recent preventive care (except blood pressure testing among older women). Most women without recent cancer screening tests had a recent physician contact, highlighting the need for greater emphasis on cancer prevention by health care providers.\r"

Seventy-five per cent of the respondents reporting an assault (n = 365) indicated that they had attempted to resist their most recent assault; talking was the most frequently used resistance strategy. The strongest predictor to emerge in the multivariate analyses of resistance was timing of assault: respondents assaulted only in childhood were less likely to resist than either respondents assaulted only in adulthood, or respondents assaulted in both phases. Univariate analyses indicated that resistance reduced the probability of sexual contact, however multivariate analyses suggested that assailant use of force was the most important determinant of assault outcome.\r"

Using a survey of program directors and relevant state documents, we identified several barriers to successful implementation: institutional (program complexity, high levels of administrative concerns along with low levels of communication between local health departments and providers); economic (inadequate resources for provider reimbursement, outreach, transportation, high-risk pregnancies, or administrative overhead); psychological (servicing populations with multiple and hard to care for problems, potential discomfort of low income women with traditional providers); and informational (insufficient information about the program infiltrating the target community).\r"

DESIGN: Cohort study with a follow-up period of 4 years. SETTING: Population-based. SUBJECTS: Elderly original volunteer subjects of the Framingham Heart Study who were free of clinically apparent coronary heart disease. This group included 406 men (mean age, 68 years: range, 60 to 90) and 735 women (mean age, 69 years: range, 59 to 90). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During 4 years of follow-up, coronary heart disease events occurred in 37 men and 33 women. Baseline echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass was associated with incidence of coronary disease in both sexes (P less than 0.01). After adjusting for age, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and the ratio of total/high density lipoprotein cholesterol, the relative risk for a coronary event, per 50 g/m increment in left ventricular mass/height, was 1.67 in men (95% CI, 1.24 to 2.23) and 1.60 in women (95% CI, 1.10 to 2.32). CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular mass offers prognostic information beyond that provided by traditional risk factors, which can improve our ability to identify individuals at high risk for coronary heart disease. These findings may have widespread implications regarding the applications of echocardiography in clinical practice.\r"

The results of an evaluation, which included tests for serum precipitins, a transbronchial biopsy, and a bronchial provocation, confirmed a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by an Aspergillus species. The findings from gravity air cultures in the home showed a heavy infestation of mold. The installation of electrostatic dust filters in the return ducts of the central air conditioning system resulted in the lowering of mold colony counts to normal levels. This change in the environment enabled the patient to live at home without having the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or a need for medication. Thirty months after the electrostatic dust filters were installed, total mold colony counts were still normal, the patient remained free of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and serum precipitins could no longer be demonstrated. The results of a bronchial challenge to Aspergillus species, however, remained positive; these positive results suggest that long-term memory immune mechanisms may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and lessen the importance of precipitins in establishing a diagnosis. We report that electrostatic dust filters may be an effective treatment for patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis when avoidance of the causative antigen cannot be easily and rapidly achieved.\r"

STUDY DESIGN: Nonrandomized trial using a criterion standard and a cohort analytic study with a 48-hour follow-up. SETTING: Referral-based university hospital. PATIENTS: Convenience sample of patients having diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Renal function and clinical status were evaluated at baseline in 1,144 patients; at 24 hours in 1,077 (94%); and at 48 hours in 663 (57%). INTERVENTIONS: After patients received saline for hydration, coronary angiography and left ventriculography were done with iopamidol (average dose, 203 +/- 56 cc). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The definite and possible incidence of major acute cardiovascular complications from nonionic contrast media was 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively. The mean serum creatinine level increased 11.5 mumol/L from baseline at 24 hours (P less than 0.0001) and 16.8 mumol/L from baseline at 48 hours (P less than 0.0001). Results in a randomly selected training sample were studied to determine predictors of a rise in serum creatinine of 44.2 mumol/L or more. The baseline serum creatinine level and age were significant predictors of renal injury, but hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, vascular disease, the volume of contrast agent injected or baseline values of urinary variables did not predict nephrotoxicity. In an independent validation sample, only the baseline serum creatinine level was confirmed as a predictor of nephrotoxicity, whereas age was not. A model that predicted contrast-induced nephropathy by the serum creatinine level showed an exponential increase in the risk for nephrotoxicity if the baseline level was 106.1 mumol/L or higher. CONCLUSIONS: Patients have a small but significant rise in serum creatinine after cardiac catheterization with a nonionic contrast agent. Baseline renal insufficiency is the only confirmed predictor of nonionic contrast-induced nephrotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To identify self-perceived problems in managing science information needs of U.S. primary practitioners and their opinion leaders. SAMPLE: A two-stage random sample of the American Medical Association's \"Masterlist of Physicians\" to identify 625 office-based physicians, including general practice, family practice, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics, and 100 physician opinion leaders. DATA COLLECTION: A formal telephone survey was completed for 79% of practitioners and 90% of opinion leaders sampled, using a pretested instrument applied by trained telephone surveyors. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: Both practitioners and opinion leaders claimed that published reviews were the most useful means of identifying their information needs. When asked about use of six recent clinical advances, that is, \"markers,\" for example, hemoglobin-A1C for diabetic control, as many as one fifth to one half were not using or were not aware of such an advance. Less than 1 in 3 practitioners personally searched the literature when information was needed; 2 in 3 claimed literature volume was unmanageable; 9 of 10 practitioners and opinion leaders assessed the scientific value of literature obtained, primarily from their own experience, with less than 1 in 10 contacting research methods specialists. Respondents suggested various innovations to better manage their science information needs in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Primary practitioners require substantial help in meeting current science information needs. Increase in such resources as \"validated reviews\" or \"expert networks\" might help meet these needs.\r"

The brief latency of the response makes it susceptible to electrical artifact contamination, and waveform identification is often difficult. As a possible alternative for a noninvasive measure of system excitability, the middle-latency response (MLR), elicited by electrical stimulation, was investigated. Middle-latency responses were recorded in response to acoustic and round-window electrical stimulation in albino guinea pigs. Acoustic and electrically evoked MLR waveforms were similar, as were their respective latency/intensity functions. Amplitude/intensity functions for the electric MLR showed greater variability than acoustically evoked MLR functions. The electric MLR is readily evoked and relatively insensitive to electrical artifact in the guinea pig. It is potentially a useful tool in assessing the integrity of auditory pathways and consequently in the development of diagnostic tests for cochlear implant candidates.\r"

The respondents were abusers of various nonintravenous drugs enrolled in seven modified outpatient treatment facilities for alcohol and other drug abuse in five geographic regions of the country. Three hundred thirty-six respondents (72%) noted that they had used cocaine one or more times prior to their entry into the treatment program. The 336 recovering cocaine users were divided into three groups: those who had used cocaine fewer than 25 times (203 [60%]); those who had used cocaine between 25 and 99 times (107 [32%]); and those who had used the drug daily plus at least 100 times total use of the drug (26 [8%]). Statistically, we found a highly significant difference between the first group and the other two groups for cocaine-associated symptoms, such as frequent sniffing, \"sinus\" problems, and diminished olfaction. Approximately 30% of those who had \"snorted\" cocaine at least 25 times but less than daily, vs 47% of those who used the drug daily, recalled that they had nasal membrane irritation with nasal crusts or scabs, recurrent nosebleeds, or both. The astute otolaryngologist should consider cocaine abuse as a cause of puzzling or recalcitrant rhinitis, even during teenage years.\r"

Commercially available software for manipulation and examination signals is discussed as adapted for examination of glottographic and acoustic signals. The relatively inexpensive availability of similar computer systems will, hopefully, encourage assessment of the clinical applications of objective techniques of voice quality.\r"

In the present study, an animal model (female Wistar rats: age range: young [Y], 3 to 5 months; old [O], 25 months; and very old [VO], 29 to 30 months) was used to examine systematically changes in the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve with age using electron microscopic morphometric techniques. Total fiber counts, fiber populations (size categories), and mean fiber size for myelinated and unmyelinated fibers did not change with age. Qualitative changes were consistent with segmental demyelination and axonal degeneration in the older animals. There was also a significant age-related increase in the volume fraction of adaxonal Schwann cell cytoplasm (Y, 0.019; O, 0.041; and VO, 0.042). Ultrastructural correlates of intracellular support and axonal transport showed a significant decrease in the numerical density of neurofilaments (Y, 0.126/micron2; O, 0.073/micron2; and VO, 0.078/micron2) in the older animals, but no change in the numerical density of microtubules. Energy metabolism correlates in the form of mitochondrial volume fraction did not change with age. There was a significant increase in the volume fraction of the intrafascicular extracellular space (Y, 0.224; O, 0.271; and VO, 0.301), indicating a late, age-related change in the extracellular environment. These changes could lead to decreased conduction velocity or complete fiber dysfunction. A number of these changes resembled those of aged human peripheral nerves already examined.\r"

Our experience with this procedure as outpatient started in 1975 at the University of Miami-Jackson Memorial Medical Center. From 1975 to 1987, 1428 cases performed in Florida and Cleveland were reviewed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the technique used. Bismuth subgallate and epinephrine mixture for hemostasis is used without relying on electrocautery, ties, or suture technique to control bleeding. The incidence of immediate and delayed postoperative bleeding in a series of patients was extremely low (four [0.28%] of 1428 cases). Our technique has good hemostatic properties allowing vessels to contract and retract into the muscle of the tonsillar fossae and adenoid bed. Bismuth subgallate activates factor XII (Hageman factor) and, therefore, markedly accelerates the cascade of blood clotting. Outpatient adenotonsillectomy is safe, cost-effective, and minimizes psychologic implications, which may be an important factor, especially in children. Ambulatory adenotonsillectomy has not been well emphasized in the literature.\r"

  ".W": "Hoarseness after endotracheal intubation can result from compression of the anterior branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve as it passes behind the thyroid cartilage to innervate the lateral cricoarytenoid muscle. This usually occurs when the cuff of the endotracheal tube lies in the larynx instead of the trachea. When a nasogastric tube is positioned in the midline, resultant postcricoid inflammation can result in vocal cord immobility. This may result from neuropraxia of the posterior branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve that innervates the posterior cricoarytenoid and interarytenoid muscles, or inflammatory spasm of the interarytenoid muscles themselves. We present a case of vocal cord paralysis after general anesthesia that may have been caused by an esophageal stethoscope. The mechanism for vocal cord immobility could be similar to that of a midline nasogastric tube with resultant postcricoid inflammation. We describe measures that can be taken to prevent vocal cord paralysis after intubation of the larynx or esophagus.\r"
