  ".U": "91109561\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical, roentgenographic and pathologic findings are described in 9 patients with fungal tracheobronchitis and comparison is made with 25 additional cases in the literature. Two morphologic patterns were identified: the first appears as a pseudomembrane of necrotic tissue, exudate, and fungal hyphae involving more-or-less the entire circumference of the bronchial wall or as mucus/fungus plugs completely occluding the airway lumen; the second consists of single or multiple discrete plaques on the airway wall, sometimes associated with invasion of the adjacent lung parenchyma or pulmonary artery. As with more invasive forms of fungal infection, a compromise in host defenses is probably the most important factor leading to fungal colonization and subsequent local invasion. Malignancies of the hematologic and lymphoreticular systems, solid neoplasms, granulocytopenia, and a history of a protracted course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, and chemotherapy were present in most of our patients and in those reported in the literature. Despite this, there is some evidence that tracheobronchitis may occur in individuals with a relatively lesser degree of host defense impairment. Local damage to the airway wall such as occurs with prolonged mechanical ventilatory support, neoplastic infiltration, or nonfungal infection may also be a factor predisposing to fungal colonization and invasion. In 4 of our patients, the fungal infection of the tracheobronchial tree probably contributed significantly to the development of terminal respiratory failure. Although recognition of the infection may not have altered the course of the underlying disease in some of our patients, in others identification and early treatment might have been life-saving. Thus, culture and histologic examination of bronchoscopically identified tracheobronchial mucus plugs and necrotic material should be performed in all immunocompromised individuals.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, we discuss the definition, characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatment of tic disorders with a major emphasis on Tourette syndrome. Although the diagnosis of a tic disorder depends on the presence of motor and/or phonic tic(s), patients with these problems also have a variety of co-morbid features including obsessive-compulsive symptoms, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, behavioral difficulties, and learning disabilities. Conservative estimates for Tourette syndrome suggest a prevalence rate of 0.1-1.0 per 1000. This syndrome is inherited in a sex-influenced autosomal dominant pattern with either chronic multiple tic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder as alternative phenotypes of the putative gene. Current evidence continues to support a pathophysiologic mechanism involving synaptic neurotransmission, with the dopaminergic system as a primary candidate. Therapeutically, it is essential to clarify whether a patient's problems are related to tics or associated behavioral difficulties. Pharmacotherapy for motor and phonic tics is strictly symptomatic and should be reserved for those with functionally disabling symptoms. A comprehensive individualized treatment program is often required in the care of individuals with tic disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Chromogranin A, co-stored and co-released with catecholamines from adrenal medullary and sympathetic neuronal vesicles, is elevated in the plasma of patients with pheochromocytoma. The usefulness of the hormone in the differential diagnosis of hypertension is examined. An elevated level of chromogranin A had comparable diagnostic sensitivity (83%, 24/29) to, but greater diagnostic specificity (96%, 86/90) than the level of plasma catecholamines when subjects with pheochromocytoma (n = 29) were evaluated in comparison to several reference groups, including normotensive controls (n = 49), subjects with essential hypertension (n = 28), subjects with renovascular hypertension (n = 5), and subjects with primary aldosteronism (n = 3). Subjects with signs or symptoms suggesting pheochromocytoma, but in whom the diagnosis was ultimately ruled out (n = 5) had normal plasma levels of chromogranin A. A modest rise in chromogranin A in those with essential hypertension, and correlation of chromogranin A with diastolic blood pressure in normotensive patients and patients with essential hypertension did not impair the diagnostic usefulness of chromogranin A for pheochromocytoma. Renal failure was associated with an elevated plasma chromogranin A independently of blood pressure. Plasma chromogranin A correlated with tumor mass, tumor chromogranin A content, tumor norepinephrine content, and urinary vanillylmandelic acid excretion; it did not correlate with plasma or urinary catecholamines, nor with blood pressure in patients with pheochromocytoma. Plasma chromogranin A levels did not differ in subjects with pheochromocytoma when stratified by age, sex, tumor location, or tumor pathology. Several drugs used in the diagnosis or treatment of pheochromocytoma (clonidine, metoprolol, phentolamine, and tyramine) had little effect on plasma chromogranin A concentration. Within the pheochromocytoma, chromogranin A was localized along with catecholamines to the soluble core of chromaffin granules, where it accounted for 18 +/- 5% of vesicle soluble protein. We conclude that 1) chromogranin A emerges along with catecholamines from pheochromocytoma chromaffin granules; 2) plasma chromogranin A is a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool in evaluation of actual or suspected pheochromocytoma; 3) plasma chromogranin A predicts pheochromocytoma tumor size and overall catecholamine production; and 4) drugs commonly employed in the diagnosis or treatment of pheochromocytoma have little effect on plasma chromogranin A level, preserving the usefulness of chromogranin A in evaluating pheochromocytoma. Thus, measurement of chromogranin A provides a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.\r"

Although a high index of suspicion is necessary, the likelihood of a pheochromocytoma is lower in the absence of the typical symptoms and findings. Nonetheless, screening must be broadened to include patients with a lower risk of the disease, such as those with resistant or labile hypertension who are minimally symptomatic. Extensive diagnostic evaluations should be reserved for those whose clinical or laboratory findings are more suggestive. Symptoms in a group of patients in whom a pheochromocytoma was seriously considered but excluded overlap symptoms in patients with a pheochromocytoma. Certain symptoms are useful: flushing to suggest a non-pheochromocytoma illness; visual symptoms, flank pain, and pallor to suggest that a pheochromocytoma is more likely. Combinations of symptoms can be of value: 2 or more symptoms from the triad of headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis were present in the majority of pheochromocytoma patients, but in a smaller number of non-pheochromocytoma patients. The presence of the entire triad is more specific, but less sensitive. New hypertension, or hypertension associated with unexplained orthostatic hypotension, are suggestive of an underlying pheochromocytoma. Twenty-four-hour urine studies are consistently abnormal in patients with a pheochromocytoma, but are also elevated in a significant proportion of non-pheochromocytoma patients. Values greater then 1.5-2-fold above the upper limit of normal are very suggestive that a pheochromocytoma is present, and warrant a more intensive subsequent evaluation. Imaging studies are reliable in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, and can help to confirm or exclude the disease. Patients with a higher clinical likelihood and any elevated urinary testing, or with a lower clinical likelihood and persistently and/or significantly elevated urinary testing, should have imaging studies performed. This combination of clinical screening, 24-hour urinary testing, and imaging studies is a useful and reliable approach to patients suspected of harboring a pheochromocytoma.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. HA-1A is a human monoclonal IgM antibody that binds specifically to the lipid A domain of endotoxin and prevents death in laboratory animals with gram-negative bacteremia and endotoxemia. METHODS. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of HA-1A, we conducted a randomized, double-blind trial in patients with sepsis and a presumed diagnosis of gram-negative infection. The patients received either a single 100-mg intravenous dose of HA-1A (in 3.5 g of albumin) or placebo (3.5 g of albumin). Other interventions, including the administration of antibiotics and fluids, were not affected by the study protocol. RESULTS. Of 543 patients with sepsis who were treated, 200 (37 percent) had gram-negative bacteremia as proved by blood culture. For the patients with gram-negative bacteremia followed to death or day 28, there were 45 deaths among the 92 recipients of placebo (49 percent) and 32 deaths among the 105 recipients of HA-1A (30 percent; P = 0.014). For the patients with gram-negative bacteremia and shock at entry, there were 27 deaths among the 47 recipients of placebo (57 percent) and 18 deaths among the 54 recipients of HA-1A (33 percent; P = 0.017). Analyses that stratified according to the severity of illness at entry showed improved survival with HA-1A treatment in both severely ill and less severely ill patients. Of the 196 patients with gram-negative bacteremia who were followed to hospital discharge or death, 45 of the 93 given placebo (48 percent) were discharged alive, as compared with 65 of the 103 treated with HA-1A (63 percent; P = 0.038). No benefit of treatment with HA-1A was demonstrated in the 343 patients with sepsis who did not prove to have gram-negative bacteremia. For all 543 patients with sepsis who were treated, the mortality rate was 43 percent among the recipients of placebo and 39 percent among those given HA-1A (P = 0.24). All patients tolerated HA-1A well, and no anti-HA-1A antibodies were detected. CONCLUSIONS. HA-1A is safe and effective for the treatment of patients with sepsis and gram-negative bacteremia.\r"

Chromosome aberrations that might be diagnostic have been identified in some types of soft-tissue tumors, but the overall frequency and diagnostic relevance of these aberrations have not been established. METHODS. We attempted to determine the karyotypes of a series of 62 consecutive, unselected malignant spindle-cell or small round-cell soft-tissue tumors (from 46 adults and 16 children) after direct harvesting of cells or short-term culture. All tumors were examined independently by immunohistochemical staining in addition to routine light-microscopical evaluation, and all but two tumors were examined by electron microscopy. RESULTS. Metaphases were obtained from 61 of the 62 tumors, and clonal chromosome aberrations were identified in 55 (89 percent). In the six tumors that yielded metaphases but lacked apparent clonal aberrations, the normal metaphases were found to originate from non-neoplastic stromal elements within the tumor specimens. Thus, all tumors in which karyotyping was successful contained clonal chromosome aberrations. Forty of 62 tumors (65 percent) contained clonal chromosome aberrations that either suggested or confirmed a specific diagnosis; in 15 of these tumors (24 percent of all tumors), the aberrations were important in establishing the final diagnosis. Cytogenetic analyses were particularly informative about small round-cell tumors from children: 8 of 14 round-cell tumors contained diagnostically important chromosome aberrations. Using the combined approaches of light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetics, we established an unambiguous diagnosis for 60 of 62 tumors. CONCLUSIONS. Cytogenetic analyses reveal clonal chromosome aberrations in virtually all malignant soft-tissue tumors. These clonal chromosome aberrations, particularly in small round-cell tumors in children, often have diagnostic relevance.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Despite the use of vidarabine, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in neonates continues to be a disease of high morbidity and mortality. We undertook a controlled trial comparing vidarabine with acyclovir for the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. METHODS. Babies less than one month of age with virologically confirmed HSV infection were randomly and blindly assigned to receive either intravenous vidarabine (30 mg per kilogram of body weight per day; n = 95) or acyclovir (30 mg per kilogram per day; n = 107) for 10 days. Actuarial rates of mortality and morbidity among the survivors after one year were compared overall and according to the extent of the disease at entry into the study (infection confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth; encephalitis; or disseminated disease). RESULTS. After adjustment for differences between groups in the extent of disease, there was no difference between vidarabine and acyclovir in either morbidity (P = 0.83) or mortality (P = 0.27). None of the 85 babies with disease confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth died. Of the 31 babies in this group who were treated with vidarabine and followed for a year, 88 percent (22 of 25) were judged to be developing normally after one year, as compared with 98 percent (45 of 46) of the 54 treated with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -4 to 24). For the 71 babies with encephalitis, mortality was 14 percent with vidarabine (5 of 36) and with acyclovir (5 of 35); of the survivors, 43 percent (13 of 30) and 29 percent (8 of 28), respectively, were developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -11 to 39). For the 46 babies with disseminated disease, mortality was 50 percent (14 of 28) with vidarabine and 61 percent (11 of 18) with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -20 to 40); of the survivors, 58 percent (7 of 12) and 60 percent (3 of 5), respectively, were judged to be developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -40 to 50). Both medications were without serious toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS. In this multicenter, randomized, blinded study there were no differences in outcome between vidarabine and acyclovir in the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. The study lacked statistical power to determine whether there were sizable differences within the subgroups of those with localized HSV, encephalitis, or disseminated disease.\r"

In a controlled trial comparing acyclovir with vidarabine in the treatment of neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, we found no significant difference between the treatments in adjusted mortality and morbidity. Hence, we sought to define for the entire cohort (n = 202) the clinical characteristics that best predicted the eventual outcome in these neonates. METHODS. Data were gathered prospectively at 27 centers between 1981 and 1988 in infants less than one month of age who had virologically confirmed HSV infection. We examined the outcomes by multivariate analyses of 24 variables. Disease was classified in one of three categories based on the extent of the involvement at entry into the trial: infection confined to skin, eyes, or mouth; encephalitis; or disseminated infection. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. There were no deaths among the 85 infants with localized HSV infection. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the 46 neonates with disseminated infection (57 percent) than in the 71 with encephalitis (15 percent). In addition, the risk of death was increased in neonates who were in or near coma at entry (relative risk, 5.2), had disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (relative risk, 3.8), or were premature (relative risk, 3.7). In babies with disseminated disease, HSV pneumonitis was also associated with greater mortality (relative risk, 3.6). In the survivors, morbidity was most frequent in infants with encephalitis (relative risk, 4.4), disseminated infection (relative risk, 2.1), seizures (relative risk, 3.0), or infection with HSV type 2 (relative risk, 4.9). With HSV infection limited to the skin, eyes, or mouth, the presence of three or more recurrences of vesicles was associated with an increased risk of neurologic impairment as compared with two or fewer recurrences.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. We describe a new form of hepatitis, occurring in 10 patients over a period of six years, characterized clinically by manifestations of severe hepatitis, histologically by large syncytial giant hepatocytes, and ultrastructurally by intracytoplasmic structures consistent with paramyxoviral nucleocapsids. RESULTS. The patients ranged in age from 5 months to 41 years. The tentative clinical diagnosis before biopsy was non-A, non-B hepatitis in five patients and autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in the others. Five patients underwent liver transplantation; the others died. The diagnosis of syncytial giant-cell hepatitis was established pathologically. The liver cords were replaced in all 10 patients by syncytial giant cells with up to 30 nuclei. In 8 of the 10 the cytoplasm contained pleomorphic particles of 150 to 250 microns, filamentous strands, and particles of 14 to 17 nm with peripherally disposed spikes resembling paramyxoviral nucleocapsids. Structures resembling degenerated forms were found in the other two patients. One of two chimpanzees injected with a liver homogenate from the index patient had an increase in the titer of paramyxoviral antibodies, probably an anamnestic reaction to previous paramyxoviral infection, suggesting that a paramyxoviral antigen but not viable virus was present in the liver homogenate. CONCLUSIONS. Although further virologic studies will be required for precise classification, we believe that paramyxoviruses should be considered in patients with severe sporadic hepatitis.\r"

We have taken advantage of these technological improvements in designing a system capable of performing magnetic manipulation of an object in a nonlinear trajectory and able to deliver hyperthermia to highly specific targets within the brain. This device relies on external magnets to pull a small metal pellet (thermoceptor) through the brain, and on biplane fluoroscopy to localize the thermoceptor with respect to previously obtained magnetic resonance images. A radiofrequency tuned circuit serves as the hyperthermia applicator and selectively heats the thermoceptor. This paper describes experiments conducted in a series of dogs showing that all three components of the system (magnetic drive, stereotactic real time imaging, and hyperthermia) can be achieved. Integration of the system was accomplished in one animal. These encouraging results need further detailed substantiation in each of the components, yet demonstrate the feasibility of such a device.\r"

  ".W": "Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) from an intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation is a grave complication of pregnancy and is responsible for 5 to 12% of all maternal deaths. We critically analyzed 154 cases of verified ICH during pregnancy from an identified intracranial lesion, including 2 patients treated at our institution and 152 cases previously reported in the literature in English. Aneurysms were responsible for ICH in 77% of patients, and arteriovenous malformations in 23%. Hemorrhage occurred antepartum in 92% of patients and postpartum in 8%. Women with angiomatous hemorrhage were younger than those with aneurysmal hemorrhage; however, in contrast to previous reports, we found no differences between angiomatous and aneurysmal hemorrhage with respect to parity or gestational age at the time of the initial hemorrhage. Hypertension and/or albuminuria were present at some time during the pregnancy in 34% of patients with documentation, which sometimes made it difficult to differentiate angiomatous or aneurysmal ICH from that associated with eclampsia. In a logistic regression analysis, surgical management of aneurysms, but not arteriovenous malformations, was associated with significantly lower maternal and fetal mortality, independent of other covariants. For those patients with a lesion not operated on, cesarean delivery afforded no better maternal or fetal outcome than did vaginal delivery. We conclude that the decision to operate after ICH during pregnancy should be based upon neurosurgical principles, whereas the method of delivery should be based upon obstetrical considerations. The perioperative and anesthetic management of the pregnant patient with a neurosurgical complication is discussed.\r"

A total of 540 pregnancies occurred among our patient population, resulting in 438 live births and 102 abortions. There were 17 pregnancies complicated by a cerebral hemorrhage. The hemorrhage rate during pregnancy for women with an unruptured AVM was 0.035 +/- 0.005 per person-year. The hemorrhage rate for nonpregnant women of childbearing age with an unruptured AVM was 0.031 +/- 0.002 per person-year. Pregnancy did not increase significantly the rate of first cerebral hemorrhage from an AVM (P = 0.35). We found that women with an AVM face a 3.5% risk of hemorrhage during pregnancy. Pregnancy is not a risk factor for hemorrhage in women without a previous hemorrhage. This conclusion assumes no selection bias exists in our study population; a bias would be introduced if the risk of fatal outcome after a hemorrhage were greater in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation was conducted to determine alterations in the biomechanical strength and stiffness characteristics of the lumbar spine fixated with Steffee instrumentation. Comparative studies of these parameters were conducted using seven lumbar columns from fresh human cadavers. Three runs were conducted on each T12-L5 column: control, injured, and fixated. The specimens were loaded under the compression-flexion mode until failure (control run) and then reloaded (injury run) to the failure deformation determined in the control run. Screw/plates were then inserted one level proximal and distal to injury, and the specimens were reloaded (fixation run). Radiographs were taken before and after each trial. Data on deformation and force histories were gathered. The load-deflection response of the injured and fixated specimens were bimodal with two representative stiffnesses. Control failure loads and stiffnesses were higher than those for the injured (P less than 0.001) or fixated (P less than 0.01) spine. Initial stiffness was significantly higher for the fixated than for injured columns (P less than 0.001), but the final stiffnesses were similar. The increase in the initial stiffness in the fixated specimen compared to the injured specimen indicates the strength added to the posterior region of the spine. The relatively smaller alteration in the final stiffness between the fixated and the injured columns, corresponding to the load shared by the anterior column, may suggest that, above a critical strain level, the anterior column absorbs a higher portion of the external load and posterior fixation may be inadequate as sole treatment in trauma.\r"

Although one-half to two-thirds of the children with supratentorial midline and infratentorial tumors had cranial nerve, oculomotor, or cerebellar deficits, only the latter were associated with specific neuropsychological deficits (poorer performance on fine-motor and visual-motor tests).

  ".W": "Stereotactic radiosurgery has been shown to treat successfully angiographically demonstrated arteriovenous malformations of the brain. Angiographic obliteration has represented cure and eliminated the risk of future hemorrhage. The role of radiosurgery in the treatment of angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs) has been less well defined. In the initial 32 months of operation of the 201-source cobalt-60 gamma knife at the University of Pittsburgh, 24 patients meeting strict criteria for high-risk AOVMs were treated. Radiosurgery was used conservatively; each patient had sustained two or more hemorrhages and had a magnetic resonance imaging-defined AOVM located in a region of the brain where microsurgical removal was judged to pose an excessive risk. Venous angiomas were excluded by performance of high-resolution subtraction angiography in each patient. Fifteen malformations were in the medulla, pons, and/or mesencephalon, and 5 were located in the thalamus or basal ganglia. Follow-up ranged from 4 to 24 months. Nineteen patients either improved or remained clinically stable and did not hemorrhage again during the follow-up interval. One patient suffered another hemorrhage 7 months after radiosurgery. Five patients experienced temporary worsening of pre-existing neurological deficits that suggested delayed radiation injury. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated signal changes and edema surrounding the radiosurgical target. Dose-volume guidelines for avoiding complications were constructed. Our initial experience indicates that stereotactic radiosurgery can be performed safely in patients with small, well-circumscribed AOVMs located in deep, critical, or relatively inaccessible cerebral locations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nineteen cats underwent unilateral craniotomy, isoflurane-induced hypotension to a mean of 50 mm Hg, and application of a brain retractor at 20 mm Hg of pressure for 1 hour. Blood pressure was returned to normal either within 3 minutes or over 20 minutes. The degree of cerebral edema formation was determined by Evans blue dye and coronal magnetic resonance imaging. All animals showed extravasation of Evans blue dye in the retracted hemisphere that was most marked at the periphery of the retractor. T1 relaxation times were significantly prolonged in the retracted hemispheres of both the fast return and slow return groups (18.8% and 17.8%, respectively) and more so at the Evans blue sites (42.8% and 40.8%), although not so strikingly beneath the retractor itself (6.3% and 7.8%). T2 relaxation times were similarly prolonged but to approximately half the degree of the T1 times. In the nonretracted hemisphere, drug-induced hypotension alone did not result in significant acute cerebral edema or blood-brain barrier alteration. There was no significant difference between the fast and slow groups in Evans blue extravasation or magnetic resonance changes. Thus, in a retractor-induced brain injury, restoration of arterial pressure to normal either gradually or rapidly did not influence the degree or extent of edema formation.\r"

Thirty patients had a ruptured distal ACA aneurysm; among these patients, the size of the aneurysm was less than 5 mm in diameter in 20, 6 to 10 mm in 7, and larger than 11 mm in 3. Eighteen patients (42.9%) had multiple aneurysms, and distal ACA aneurysms were responsible for a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 10. Thirty-four patients underwent direct surgery, and 30 of these had excellent outcomes 3 months after surgery. The treatment of patients with distal ACA aneurysms is often technically difficult, because of their broad neck configuration and the coexistence of other aneurysms. Nevertheless, the present study emphasizes that distal ACA aneurysms tend to bleed, irrespective of their size, and that excellent outcomes are obtainable by direct surgery.\r"

  ".U": "91109947\r", 
  ".W": "Temporary clipping of the major arterial trunk is an important maneuver to control excessive unexpected bleeding in neurosurgical operations; however, repeated temporary clipping can give rise to severe neurological deficits after surgery. The present study was performed to confirm and explain these clinical findings. Initially, a single 20-minute or 1-hour occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was performed in each of 5 cats. Pial arterial diameter was determined by video imaging, regional cerebral blood flow was measured by autoradiography, and cerebral edema and infarction were observed. In the 20-minute occlusion group, no abnormal changes were found 5 hours after recirculation. In the 1-hour occlusion group, pial arteries were dilated by 45%, and regional cerebral blood flow increased to more than twice the resting cortical values. The extent of cerebral edema was 41.2 +/- 7.5% (SE) and infarction was 34.5 +/- 9.5% (SE) of the hemisphere. In the second experiment, three 20-minute occlusions of the middle cerebral artery in a 1-hour interval were performed in 20 cats. In 10 of them, thiopental (40 mg/kg) was used to protect the brain. In the group without barbiturate treatment, pial arteries were dilated by 40% at the end of experiment, regional cerebral blood flow decreased to about 70% compared with single 20-minute occlusion, cerebral edema was 19.5 +/- 8.1% (SE), and infarction was 8.1 +/- 3.7% (SE) of the hemisphere. In the treated group, these were only trivial changes. The effect of repeated clipping may cumulatively cause brain damage, and barbiturates should be used whenever repeated clipping is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "The cause of chronic cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage has been studied intensively, but it is still controversial whether the observable luminal narrowing should be attributed to the contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells or whether it results from some organic change in the wall. A proliferation of myointimal cells, accompanied by increased deposition of collagen, as well as myonecrosis, have been frequently observed several days after aneurysm rupture. Studies from our laboratory showed that these myointimal cells had characteristics identical to myofibroblasts. In this study, we quantitatively and morphologically examined the effect of cerebrospinal fluid on the ability of myofibroblasts to alter collagen matrices using an in vitro model. Myofibroblasts contract the collagen matrix by rearranging or compacting the framework of collagen fibers. Cerebrospinal fluid obtained from patients with recently ruptured aneurysms significantly accelerated lattice contraction, especially when the patient developed symptomatic vasospasm. This study suggests that myofibroblasts in the spastic artery can produce a contractile force that contributes to chronic vasospasm, tightening the proliferated collagen. Some unknown agent present in bloody cerebrospinal fluid accelerates the rearrangement of the collagen lattice by myofibroblasts, both of which have, until now, been considered non-contractile components.\r"

Follow-up computed tomographic scans were performed later than 1 month after subarachnoid hemorrhage to reveal permanent hypodense areas consistent with cerebral infarction. Occurrence of hypodense lesions on the follow-up computed tomographic scan was significantly associated with the presence of delayed ischemic deterioration (DID) (P less than 0.01). Patients with subcortical or cortical cerebral infarctions due to DID released more platelet thromboxane B2 than those with no evidence of a hypodense lesion on the computed tomographic scan (P less than 0.05). Hypodense areas caused by an intracerebral hematoma or small, deep-seated infarcts due to DID were not associated with significantly elevated release of thromboxane B2, but the lacunar type infarcts were associated with increased aggregation of platelets. The results suggest that augmented platelet function may be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction due to DID.\r"

This study was designed to examine the reliability of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) after transcranial magnetic stimulation in monkeys anesthetized intravenously with ET. The ET regimen was as follows: an initial dose (0.5 mg/kg) followed by 13 doses (0.2 mg/kg every 6-12 min; mean, 8.0 +/- 1.3 min). The total dose administered was 3.1 mg/kg. The magnetic coil was placed over the MEP scalp stimulation region. Evoked electromyographic responses were recorded from the contralateral abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor hallucis (AH) muscles of the fore- and hindlimbs, respectively. Reproducible MEP responses were consistently recorded while the animal was under total ET anesthesia. The coil demography was altered and the MEP scalp topography was moderately reduced by ET injections. Significant threshold elevation was noted after a total dose of 1.7 mg/kg for APB responses and 0.5 mg/kg for AH responses (P less than 0.05). Marked prolongation of latency was observed after a dose of 0.5 mg/kg for APB MEPs and 2.5 mg/kg for AH MEPs (P less than 0.05). MEP amplitude responses showed marked variability. Repeated doses of ET produced a mean threshold rise of 14 to 28% for the APB and 19 to 29% for the AH. The mean latency delay was 5 to 11% for the APB and 0.5 to 8% for the AH, while the mean amplitude depression was 24 to 59% for the APB and 15 to 50% for the AH. Apparent seizure activity or abnormalities in behavior and feeding were not noted over a 1-year period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The median values did not differ significantly between the two types of hydrocephalus or from the concentrations in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid obtained from patients without intracranial pathology during lumbar myelography for possible lumbar disc disease. Hence, there is no evidence that eicosanoids accumulate in the ventricles in hydrocephalus, and it is unlikely that they have a significant role in its symptomatology.\r"

In one case, a giant, bilobed, partially thrombosed aneurysm exhibited marked mass effect on the adjacent medulla. In the second case, diffuse severe cerebral vasospasm, 3 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage, rendered transvascular treatment of the aneurysm difficult. Increasing vertigo and nausea caused by mass effect from an aneurysm previously coated with methyl methacrylate warranted treatment in the third case. Indications for transvascular coil treatment included relative surgical inaccessibility to the aneurysm, and, in our case, inability to perform transarterial detachable balloon therapy. The aneurysms were obliterated by endovascular coil embolization in each case. In the patient with vasospasm, aneurysm treatment followed angioplasty of the major affected cerebral vessels, resulting in significant neurological improvement within 24 hours. Two patients were neurologically intact at the time of discharge, and the third displayed persistent cerebellar signs despite a marked decrease in vertigo and nausea. Reports of transvascular coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms are very rare. Our experience with these patients demonstrates that this technique can be successfully utilized in selected cases.\r"

It is classically defined by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, considerably elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, and an enlarged sella turcica. In this report, we present three cases initially treated by transsphenoidal sellar exploration for Cushing's disease. In two of these cases, remission of hypercortisolism did not occur after the initial pituitary exploration. A microadenomectomy was performed in one case and, in the other, no microadenoma was found. In both, Nelson's syndrome occurred after adrenalectomy. A second transsphenoidal operation and radiotherapy were required to control tumor growth. In another case, transsphenoidal adenomectomy of an ACTH-secreting tumor initially led to a remission of hypercortisolism for 4 years, but recurrent Cushing's disease necessitated adrenalectomy, and again Nelson's syndrome occurred. The documentation of a pre-existing ACTH-secreting basophilic pituitary microadenoma before adrenalectomy, as seen in two of our cases, has not been previously reported, and these observations of \"non-classical\" courses have major implications for the pathophysiology of Nelson's syndrome.\r"

The characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings of trigeminal neurinoma in the cavernous sinus are presented, and the different surgical approaches are discussed.\r"

In both patients, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the tumors occupied the suprasellar cistern, invaginated the floor of the 3rd ventricle and were tightly adherent to the ventricular walls. The intraventricular portions of the tumors were cystic, containing protein-rich fluid as suggested by MRI and confirmed by operative findings. There was perifocal edema in the hypothalamus adjacent to the intraventricular tumor, the optic tracts, and the posterior limbs of the internal capsules, resembling the shape of a moustache on axial computed tomographic and MRI scans. The perifocal edema subsided after treatment of the intraventricular tumor by surgical resection or radiation therapy. The \"moustache\" appearance seems a unique, characteristic feature of perifocal edema, which is observed infrequently with certain craniopharyngiomas.\r"

Numerous types of surgical management have been described, but a uniform surgical approach has not been accepted. The purpose of this review was to examine modes of surgical therapy reported in the literature since 1976, as well as the 11-year experience at our institution. Twenty-eight cases were extracted from the literature and seven more were identified at our institution. The incidence in our population was one per 45,145 live births. Among 27 cases managed by packing and drainage, an 82% overall survival was achieved, whereas only 25% of eight patients undergoing hepatic lobectomy survived (P = .006). Hepatic hemorrhage with persistent hypotension unresponsive to blood products should be managed by evacuating the hematoma, packing the damaged liver, and draining the operative site. More aggressive surgical techniques, such as hepatic artery ligation or hepatic lobectomy, should be reserved for refractory cases.\r"

However, before the utility of CRP can be studied in pregnancies with these complications, the effects of normal pregnancy and labor on maternal serum CRP levels must be established. We determined CRP levels serially from 22 weeks' gestation until delivery in healthy pregnant women without antepartum complications. Median CRP values for women not in labor ranged from 0.7-0.9 mg/dL, depending on gestational age; 95% of the values were 1.5 mg/dL or lower. No consistent change in CRP levels with gestational age was found among serially sampled women not in labor. The median CRP value for women in labor at term was 1.3 mg/dL, and 32% of values were over 1.5 mg/dL. Median CRP values in normal pregnancies appear to be higher than standardized values for nonpregnant individuals, and CRP values are further elevated in labor. Understanding the physiology and temporal course of the increase in CRP in normal pregnancy and labor may help to clarify the appropriate use of CRP in complicated pregnancies.\r"

Although the reflectance meters appeared to be useful for assessing blood glucose trends in the pregnant diabetic, the results obtained from these meters would be unacceptable in the laboratory setting. Unfortunately, because of the erratic combination of proportional and constant bias, correction factors are not easily ascertained. Laboratories and physicians should reconsider the use of these reflectance meters for inpatient evaluation and general population screening of pregnant women.\r"

However, the urinary sediment of preeclamptic patients revealed the same uniform pattern regardless of the state of coagulation, or the presence or absence of oliguria or eclamptic seizures. Numerous granular and hyaline casts, red-cell, and tubular cell casts were identified during microscopic evaluation. These data reflect both glomerular and tubular damage in preeclampsia. We conclude that urinary sediment analysis in severe preeclampsia uniformly reflects renal parenchymal damage and does not correlate with or predict the clinical course of the disease.\r"

However, this relationship was not confirmed by multivariate analysis controlling for other risk factors. On both univariate and multivariate analyses, both early and later in pregnancy, hematocrits above 40% were associated with preterm delivery. In every gestational time period, at least part of the excess of preterm births was explained by an increase in indicated preterm deliveries. In both early and late pregnancy, and in both the univariate and multivariate analyses, only high hematocrits were associated with fetal growth retardation. The strongest association (odds ratio above 2) between high hematocrit and both fetal growth retardation and preterm delivery occurred with hematocrits at or above 43% at 31-34 weeks' gestation.\r"

Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) was introduced as an alternative to repeat cesarean in 1982. The impact of VBAC on the cesarean rate for our institution was assessed from 1982-1988. Over the period studied, the rate of repeat cesarean rose from 5.0% in 1982 to 6.9% in 1985, then steadily fell to 5.3% in 1988. During this same period, the primary cesarean rate rose from 7.5% in 1982 to 11.9% in 1986, then declined to 10.6% in 1988. Changes in the rate for all cesareans paralleled those for primary procedures: 12.5% in 1982, 17.6% in 1986, and 15.9% in 1988. In patients with a history of previous cesarean, the relative risk of repeat cesarean dropped from 10.2 (95% confidence interval 8.8-11.8) in 1982 to 5.2 (95% confidence interval 4.5-6.0) in 1988. In the face of a rising rate of primary cesarean births, the introduction of VBAC has helped to stabilize the overall cesarean rate at our institution.\r"

In addition, each woman received twice-weekly studies of the uteroplacental and umbilical circulations by means of Doppler ultrasound. There were no fetal deaths in the study. Of the individual methods of fetal surveillance, absence of end-diastolic frequencies in the umbilical artery was the most sensitive, predicting 91% of fetuses who developed fetal distress in the first stage. Combining the test with sonographic estimation of amniotic fluid columns improved the prediction to 100%, with only a minimal fall in the specificity. These results strongly suggest that a combination of umbilical artery Doppler waveforms and amniotic fluid determinations is an adequate method of monitoring the post-dates pregnancy.\r"

Most of the earlier studies did not specify the exact segment of umbilical artery sampled. We studied 53 normal singleton pregnancies between 18-41 weeks' gestation to compare S-D ratio measurements of the umbilical artery at different sites: 1) abdominal insertion site, 2) placental insertion site, 3) mid-cord, and 4) an undetermined site. The mean S-D ratio was significantly different (P less than .01) at various segments of the umbilical artery--higher near the abdominal insertion site when compared with the mid-cord, near-placental, and undetermined sites. The S-D ratio at mid-cord was higher than at the undetermined site and the placental insertion site. The near-placental-site S-D ratio was not different from the undetermined site. A lower S-D ratio at the undetermined site may not adequately reflect the true physiologic status of the fetus. Specifying the site of measurement should be an integral part of any report, in order to describe accurately the pathophysiology of fetoplacental circulatory diseases.\r"

During the study, other maternal-fetal functional indices were recorded: hPL, estriol, hematocrit, platelets, mean platelet volume, and uric acid. No abnormalities were found in the uterine, umbilical, middle cerebral, thoracic descending aorta, and renal artery velocimetry in post-dates gestations. However, a significant reduction of the time-averaged mean velocity in the descending thoracic aorta was associated with an increased incidence of oligohydramnios, meconium-stained fluid, abnormal NST, and cesarean delivery for fetal distress. The present study suggests that serial Doppler flow measurements of mean velocity of the fetal descending thoracic aorta may be a simple and rapid technique for identifying prolonged pregnancies at increased risk for perinatal complications.\r"

We hypothesized that Doppler systolic-diastolic ratios (S/Ds) in pregnancies complicated by maternal syphilis infection might reflect an increased resistance to placental perfusion. Doppler velocity waveform analysis was used to study the uterine and umbilical arteries in third-trimester pregnancies complicated by maternal syphilis infection. A control group of similarly studied normal pregnancies was used for comparison. Statistically significant increases were found in the mean S/Ds of both the uterine and umbilical arteries in the syphilis group compared with the normal group, indicating an increased resistance to perfusion of the placenta in pregnancies complicated by syphilis. This difference was even greater in association with the identification of spirochetes in the amniotic fluid by dark-field microscopy, indicating that the S/D results are related to the presence of intrauterine infection. Serial S/Ds in a small subgroup of patients correlated with the clinical courses, including an apparent acute vascular-resistance change associated with treatment, probably due to the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. Because of these post-treatment vascular events, the pre-treatment S/D alone may have a limited clinical predictive value for treatment efficacy in congenital syphilis.\r"

Humeral and femoral lengths and nuchal folds were evaluated in 400 normal second-trimester controls and in 24 consecutive Down syndrome fetuses (14-20 weeks) undergoing amniocentesis for advanced maternal age or low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). Using the 400 normal control fetuses undergoing amniocentesis, the relationship between humeral length and biparietal diameter (BPD) was: Expected humeral length = -7.9404 + 0.8492 x BPD. A ratio of measured-to-expected humeral length of less than 0.90 identified 12 of 24 fetuses (50%) with Down syndrome and 25 of 400 normals (6.25%). Twelve of the 24 Down syndrome fetuses had a nuchal fold measuring 6 mm or larger. Combining nuchal fold findings with these humeral length criteria identified 18 of 24 affected fetuses (75%) without appreciable change in specificity, yielding a positive predictive value of 4.6% for women with a risk of one in 250 (age 35) of having a Down syndrome fetus. For women with risks of one in 500 and one in 1000 of having an affected fetus based on maternal age, a shortened humerus or thickened nuchal fold yielded positive predictive values of 2.3 and 1.2%, respectively.\r"

Sepsis was not proved in any of the 38 infants delivered to these patients. There was a clear relationship between histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis and failure of tocolytic therapy. Fetal lung profiles were mature in 29% of the amnionic fluid samples from 30-32 weeks' gestation, but in none of the amnionic fluid samples before 30 weeks.

Bleeding patterns, endometrial histology, and metabolic parameters were studied in 48 postmenopausal women prospectively randomized to a continuous schedule (daily estrogen and progestin) or a sequential schedule (conjugated estrogen on days 1-25, medroxyprogesterone acetate on days 16-25). Doses studied were 0.625 and 1.25 mg of conjugated estrogens and 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Significantly greater bleeding was observed with the 1.25-mg dosage of conjugated estrogens. Bleeding patterns were similar between schedules, with the exception that amenorrhea was more prevalent in the women using the 1.25-mg dosage of estrogen and the continuous progestin schedule. More frequent endometrial atrophy was observed with the continuous schedule, supporting the concept that prolonged use of this schedule may promote amenorrhea in most patients. Both doses and schedules were associated with modest and insignificant increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Sequential therapy did not prevent the estrogen-induced decrease of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas the continuous schedule did, particularly with 0.625-mg dosage of conjugated estrogens. Significant increases of triglycerides were also seen with the continuous but not with the sequential schedule. Because of reports that the continuous schedule using the 2.5-mg dosage of medroxyprogesterone acetate does not elicit these actions on circulating lipids, attention should be directed toward examining the long-term effects of this lower dosage given continuously.\r"

  ".W": "There is still confusion as to whether ovulation in a succeeding cycle is a random event or is more likely to occur at the ipsilateral or contralateral ovary. Both histologic and sonographic data support alternating ovulation. Some ultrasound studies have suggested that ipsilateral ovulation is more likely in succeeding cycles, and another found right-sided ovulation to be more common. Because many of the studies are based upon small numbers, we initiated a large study to determine the more likely side of ovulation. Furthermore, the present investigation attempted to confirm biochemically the true existence of the dominant follicle by demonstrating appropriate serum estradiol levels. Evaluation of natural cycles (286 pairs) demonstrated 52.4% ipsilateral ovulation and 47.6% contralateral ovulation. Right-sided ovulation occurred in 54.5% of cycles. Our data suggest that the side of ovulation in successive cycles is not influenced by the side of ovulation in the preceding cycle.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about the fertility potential of semen from men who fulfill the accepted criteria of normal semen quality. We examined retrospectively the fertility rates of semen donors with normal semen quality. Donor performance was evaluated in women who had no known infertility factors or had only ovulatory dysfunction corrected by clomiphene. Cycles of therapeutic donor insemination were monitored for ovulation, and pregnancy outcome was followed up. Pregnancy resulted from therapeutic donor insemination with 21 donors and did not result in pregnancy with five (the range of the percentage of cycles in which pregnancy occurred was zero to 31). The comparison of donor semen analysis characteristics with pregnancy rates indicated that the total number of motile spermatozoa per ejaculate correlated with pregnancy rate (P = .04). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that when the value for percentage of abnormal forms was combined with the total number of motile spermatozoa, a significant negative association was found between abnormal forms and conception (P = .04). Experiments comparing semen from high-fertility donors (top quartile of pregnancy rate) and low-fertility donors (lowest quartile) demonstrated a greater proportion of spermatozoa with inducible acrosome reactions in the high-fertility group (P less than .05). A Wright-Giemsa stain used to detect subtle abnormal forms in spermatozoa did not discriminate between the groups. These data suggest that differences in fertility potential exist among donors, even though all may exceed the accepted criteria for normal semen quality. Differences in the ability of spermatozoa to capacitate or undergo the acrosome reaction may be a mechanism for diminished fertility in donors with normal semen characteristics.\r"

This condition is a relatively new complication, related to the recent practice of conservative surgical management of tubal pregnancy. Much has been written on the identification and possible therapy for this condition but little is known about its pathophysiology. Eight cases of persistence were studied, as well as three cases of failed conservative procedures. In nine instances, the surgeon had concentrated appropriately on the maximally dilated portion of the tube, which contained the blood clot and aborted products of conception. Unfortunately, the implantation site was located medially, toward the uterus. Ways of avoiding this complication include medial exploration or possibly the use of mesosalpingeal injection of vasopressin. An understanding of the natural history of the pathologic process might also be valuable in the management of cases of \"persistence\" identified solely by a continuing beta-hCG titer.\r"

We evaluated 95 patients with squamous cell tumors who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy between January 1975 and December 1985 and who were thought to be at low risk for recurrence to see whether other clinical or histopathologic factors were predictive of tumor recurrence. Detailed retrospective record review and complete pathology review were accomplished for each case. The 5-year actuarial survival rate was 89%. Nine patients developed recurrent disease (9.5%), of whom eight died. Several clinical features were evaluated as possible prognostic factors: patient age (P = .26), patient race (P = .60), cervical diameter (P = .24), extent of gross cervical involvement (P = .36), and presence of contact bleeding (P = .82). Histopathologic features were examined: depth of invasion (P = .31), number of mitoses (P = .42), character of the tumor-stromal border (P = .15), histologic differentiation (P = .02), lymph-vascular space invasion (P = .56), and width of tumor (P = .23). Depth of invasion did correlate with increasing tumor width (P less than .001). Once node- and margin-positive patients are excluded, differentiation may be the only feature useful in identifying patients at risk for recurrence. Because almost one-half of our patients had poorly differentiated tumors, sole use of this feature as a criterion for adjuvant therapy would have resulted in overtreatment of low-risk patients.\r"

Urodynamic data and specific urodynamic diagnoses of 108 women with urinary incontinence were compared before and 6 months after treatment with bladder training. Before treatment, 76 women had sphincteric incompetence, 11 had detrusor instability, and 16 had both. After treatment, 33 women no longer fulfilled the urodynamic diagnostic criteria for either sphincter or detrusor dysfunction. Controlling for severity before treatment, the number of incontinent episodes post-treatment was not associated with change in urodynamic diagnosis. Only the first sensation to void, voided volume, compliance, functional urethral length, and flow time showed any significant changes between pre- and post-treatment evaluations; however, none were correlated with change in the number of incontinent episodes. Bladder training does not appear to affect lower tract urodynamic variables or specific urodynamic diagnosis, and it is likely that its mechanism of action reflects adaptive behavioral changes. Physiologic changes not detected with techniques and/or criteria used in this study may still occur.\r"

To determine factors that might contribute to postpartum infections following antibiotic prophylaxis, we cultured amniotic fluid, decidua, and chorioamniotic membrane specimens for anaerobic and facultative bacteria and for genital mycoplasmas at cesarean delivery. Women were assessed daily for the development of infections, and if endometritis developed, a protected endometrial culture was obtained. Postpartum endometritis developed in 16 and wound infection in four of 102 women. Infection rates were similar for women receiving cefotetan (N = 50) or cefoxitin (N = 52) for prophylaxis. The isolation of group B streptococcus (P less than .001) or Enterococcus faecalis (P = .03) from the upper genital tract at delivery was significantly associated with postpartum endometritis. Antibiotic-resistant organisms (other than enterococci) were recovered uncommonly at delivery or with postpartum infections. Group B streptococcus was susceptible to the prophylactic agents used, suggesting that virulence factors other than antibiotic resistance are important for the development of postpartum endometritis. Group B streptococcus, E faecalis, and bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis were recovered from the endometrium at the time of postpartum endometritis.\r"

Success was achieved by PGE2 in 93% (55 of 59) and oxytocin in 91% (20 of 22). The mean duration of labor was 13.1 hours with PGE2 and 8.2 hours with oxytocin. The mean dose of PGE2 was 65.2 mg; of oxytocin, 200 units. Women who received PGE2 experienced nausea (46%), vomiting (37%), fever (64%), and diarrhea (20%) despite appropriate premedication. Few side effects occurred in the women who were treated with oxytocin.

Prolonged fasting has potential liabilities. Maternal mortality is rare, and anesthesia-related causes are not among the common etiologies. Aspiration is not a significant factor in the modern era. Higher risk for anesthesia morbidity is associated with general anesthesia, particularly difficult intubation. Instead of implicating oral intake as a risk factor for pulmonary aspiration, the literature consistently emphasizes the critical role of properly trained and dedicated obstetric anesthesia personnel. Unless parturients are not candidates for regional anesthesia, a nonparticulate diet should be allowed. Liberal use of regional anesthesia as well as antacid prophylaxis is recommended.\r"

Although more extensive laboratory and clinical experience is necessary to evaluate adequately the safety of early transabdominal CVS, it may be advantageous to offer this technique to certain high-genetic-risk patients.

The sensitivities for the rapid tests were 15.1% for Streptex and 21.5% for Equate. Specificities were 99.3 and 98.7%, respectively. Sensitivity was minimally increased in the setting of ruptured membranes for both tests. Likewise, use of separate swabs for streaking the culture plate and performing the rapid test increased the sensitivity, but this was not significant for either test. In control experiments, the limit of sensitivity of both rapid tests was 5 x 10(6) colony-forming units. We conclude that at present, these tests are not sensitive enough for routine use in this type of clinical setting.\r"

This kinase is a single 92-kDa polypeptide and migrates in perfect alignment with 32P-labeled HRI on SDS/PAGE. Its functions of binding ATP and of autophosphorylation and eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation are inhibited by hemin. The amino acid sequences of three tryptic peptides of HRI have been obtained. A search of the data base of the National Biomedical Research Foundation reveals that these amino acid sequences are unique and that two of these three sequences show homology to protein kinases. HRI peptide P-52 contains Asp-Phe-Gly, which is the most highly conserved short stretch of amino acids in catalytic domain VII of protein kinases. HRI peptide P-74 contains the conserved amino acid residues Asp-(Met)-Tyr-Ser-(Val)-Gly-Val found in catalytic domain IX of protein kinases [Hanks, S. K., Quinn, A. M. & Hunter, T. (1988) Science 241, 42-52]. These findings are consistent with the autokinase and eIF-2 alpha kinase activities of HRI. Synthetic HRI peptide P-74 is a very potent inhibitor of eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation by HRI. Since little is known about the function of conserved domain IX, P-74 peptide may be useful in elucidating the role of this domain of protein kinases.\r"

Crosslinking of both polypeptides required a functional 5' splice site but was not dependent on sequences at the 3' end of the intron. Centrifugation of extract separated the two polypeptides from major U small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), including U1 snRNPs. Both polypeptides crosslinked to precursor RNAs containing 5' splice sites in the absence of U1 RNA. Complexes containing both polypeptides also contained U1 snRNPs, suggesting that SPP-1 and SPP-2 are a part of the functional spliceosome. We propose that SPP-1 and SPP-2 are factors that participate in the recognition of 5' splice sites.\r"

We have purified hemozoin from the human malaria organism Plasmodium falciparum and have used infrared spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and chemical synthesis to determine its structure. The molecule consists of an unusual polymer of hemes linked between the central ferric ion of one heme and a carboxylate side-group oxygen of another. The hemes are sequestered via this linkage into an insoluble product, providing a unique way for the malaria parasite to avoid the toxicity associated with soluble heme.\r"

  ".U": "91110523\r", 
  ".W": "In the mammalian cerebral cortex, neurons destined for layers 2-6 are generated only after the period of genesis for a group of transient neurons that populate the subplate and marginal zones. Although a number of molecular markers for the subplate zone exist, most are also expressed by other cell populations in the cortical plate. To begin to study molecular properties of the subplate, we generated monoclonal antibodies against homogenates of cat cortical subplate zone. One monoclonal antibody, termed subplate 1 (SP1), recognized a polypeptide of 56 kDa. This antigen was strongly expressed within the subplate neurons only during a 3-week period beginning at birth and extending until 3 weeks after birth. From postnatal day 1, the number of SP1-immunoreactive neurons below the visual cortex increased until the end of second postnatal week and then declined thereafter. This period coincides with the period when a majority of the subplate neurons undergo naturally occurring cell death. The antigen was not expressed by subplate neurons surviving in the adult white matter. At the peak of antigen expression, 14% or less of the immunoreactive neurons also coexpressed gamma-aminobutyric acid, somatostatin, or neuropeptide Y. Biochemical and immunocytochemical properties of the SP1 antigen were also compared with the Alz-50 antigen (A68), a marker for dying neurons. On Western blots, SP1- and Alz-50-reactive polypeptides were selectively enriched in cytosolic fractions of kitten cerebral cortex, but each marker recognized different molecular weight polypeptides. In tissue sections many subplate, cortical plate, and layer 1 neurons were Alz-50 immunoreactive. In contrast, a rarer subpopulation of neurons restricted to the subplate was labeled by SP1. We propose that the SP1 antigen is a protein expressed within dying cortical subplate neurons, at the commencement of cell death.\r"

When DNA from single, dissected chromosome segments 2q21-qter and 2q24-pter were used as templates, a sodium channel-specific 172-base-pair polymerase chain reaction product was obtained. This product was not synthesized when segments 2q21-pter and 2q24-qter were used. Chromosome microdissection-polymerase chain reaction is not only a simple, fast, and accurate method for gene mapping but also may offer significant advantages for other applications, such as cancer cytogenetics and linkage analysis.\r"

We have used the polymerase chain reaction to identify and clone a cDNA (PC3) from the mouse AtT20 anterior pituitary cell line that represents an additional member of this growing family of mammalian proteases. PC3 encodes a 753-residue protein that begins with a signal peptide and contains a 292-residue domain closely related to the catalytic modules of PC2, furin, and kex2. Within this region 58%, 65%, and 50% of the amino acids of PC3 are identical to those of the aligned PC2, furin, and kex2 sequences, respectively, and the catalytically important Asp, His, and Ser residues are all conserved. On Northern blots, PC3 hybridizes to two transcripts of 3 and 5 kilobases. Tissue distribution studies indicate that both PC2 and PC3 are expressed in a variety of neuroendocrine tissues, including pancreatic islets and brain, but are not expressed in liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, and spleen. The high degree of similarity of PC3, PC2, and furin suggests that they are all members of a superfamily of mammalian proteases that are involved in the processing of prohormones and/or other protein precursors. In contrast to furin, PC3, like PC2, lacks a hydrophobic transmembrane anchor, but it has a potential C-terminal amphipathic helical segment similar to the putative membrane anchor of carboxypeptidase H. These and other differences suggest that these proteins carry out compartmentalized proteolysis within cells, such as processing within regulated versus constitutive secretory pathways.\r"

This protein is associated with virulent strains of B. pertussis but its function has remained unclear. In this report we demonstrate that purified preparations of the 69-kDa outer membrane protein can promote the attachment of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The interaction between the mammalian cells and this protein can be specifically inhibited by an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing synthetic peptide that is homologous with a region found in the 69-kDa protein sequence. These studies indicate that a specific cell binding site containing an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence may be involved in the interaction of this bacterial protein with mammalian cell surfaces. To further investigate the role of this protein as a bacterial adhesin, a mutant of B. pertussis W28 that does not express the 69-kDa protein was constructed using the plasmid vector pRTP1. This mutant was 30-40% less efficient at adhering to CHO cells and to human HeLa cells than was the parent strain. These data support a role for this 69-kDa outer membrane protein in the attachment of B. pertussis to mammalian cells. We propose the name \"pertactin\" for this protein.\r"

  ".U": "91110527\r", 
  ".W": "The zeta chain has emerged to be a key subunit of the T-cell antigen receptor with central roles not only in intracellular assembly of the multimeric receptor but also in mediating signal transduction events. This subunit is present in natural killer (NK) cells that lack the other subunits of the T-cell antigen receptor. In NK cells, the zeta chain appears to be associated with the NK Fc receptor [type 3 receptor for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc gamma RIII or CD16)] and may be necessary for efficient cell surface expression of this receptor complex. In T cells, the zeta chain is a prominent substrate that becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after occupancy of the TCR; zeta chain phosphorylation was in fact the first evidence that the TCR was coupled to a protein-tyrosine kinase as well as to inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. To determine if Fc gamma RIII is coupled to a protein-tyrosine kinase in a manner analogous to the T-cell antigen receptor, we investigated ligand-dependent zeta-chain phosphorylation in NK cells. We observed that activation of NK cells with an anti-Fc gamma RIII monoclonal antibody induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the zeta chain whereas other activating stimuli, such as the combination of phorbol ester and ionomycin or a lymphokine, interleukin 2, did not result in phosphorylation of this protein. Perturbation of Fc gamma RIII by the more physiological stimulus, incubation of NK cells with antibody-coated target cells, also induced zeta-chain phosphorylation. Previous data have indicated that the NK-cell Fc gamma RIII is coupled to inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. This present finding that Fc gamma RIII is coupled to a protein-tyrosine kinase illustrates that there are significant similarities in the signaling pathways activated by Fc gamma RIII in NK cells and the T-cell antigen receptor in T cells; the zeta chain is a common element that may serve as a coupling protein for both of these receptors.\r"

It was found that the mu and kappa opioid agonists were able to inhibit the capacity of murine lymphoid cells to generate antibody at concentrations as low as 10(-10) M. The effects were almost completely blocked by pretreatment with naloxone or naltrexone, opioid-specific antagonists. Only the kappa-agonist activity was abrogated by pretreatment with norbinaltorphimine, a kappa-specific antagonist. The stereospecificity of the kappa effect was demonstrated using isomers of U50,488H, with the (-) form possessing significantly greater immunomodulatory activity. Additional studies, using a mu receptor-deficient mouse strain, demonstrated that only the kappa agonists were capable of suppressing antibody responses, whereas mu- and kappa-selective agonists suppressed the parent mu-responsive strain. Our results clearly indicate that mu and kappa opioid receptors are involved in regulation of lymphoid cell production of antibodies.\r"

Enzyme activity during purification was bioassayed by the L-arginine-, NADPH-, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent formation of a plasma membrane-permeable nitric oxide-like factor that stimulated soluble guanylyl cyclase in RFL-6 cells. With calmodulin and NADPH as cofactors, purified soluble GAF synthase induced an increase of 1.05 mumol of cGMP per 10(6) RFL-6 cells per 3 min per mg of protein. The coproduct of this signal-transduction pathway appeared to be L-citrulline. GAF synthase catalyzed the conversion of 107 nmol of L-arginine into L-citrulline per min per mg of protein. Based on these assays, this represents a purification of GAF synthase of approximately 10,076- and 8925-fold with recoveries of 16% and 19%, respectively. Rechromatography of the purified enzyme on Mono P (isoelectric point = 6.1 +/- 0.3), Mono Q, and Superose 12 or 6 resulted in no further purification or increase in specific activity. A Stokes radius of 7.9 +/- 0.3 nm and a sedimentation coefficient s20,w of 7.8 +/- 0.2 S were used to calculate a molecular mass of about 279 +/- 25 kDa for the native enzyme. SDS/PAGE revealed a single protein band with a molecular mass of about 155 +/- 3 kDa. These data suggest that soluble GAF synthase purified from rat cerebellum is a homodimer of 155-kDa subunits and that enzyme activity is dependent upon the presence of calmodulin.\r"

Addition of the tRNA wobble base queuine, in the presence of 6-TG, maintains the proliferative capability of the cells. The ability of 6-TG to induce differentiation correlates with c-myc mRNA down-regulation, but queuine has no effect on this parameter. Treatment with 6-TG for 2-3 days commits HL-60 cells to granulocytic differentiation, and, once committed, these cells do not respond to the monocytic inducer phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Nonetheless, when cells are treated with queuine and 6-TG, they maintain the promyelocytic morphology and are capable of being induced down the monocytic pathway by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as indicated by stabilization of c-fms mRNA and cell adherence. In the absence of queuine, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is incapable of inducing monocytic markers in the 6-TG-treated cells. The data presented indicate that 6-TG-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is a tRNA-facilitated event and that the tRNA wobble base queuine is capable of maintaining both the proliferative and pluripotent potential of the cells.\r"

  ".W": "Hormone release from nerve terminals in the neurohypophysis is a sensitive function of action potential frequency. We have investigated the cellular mechanisms responsible for this frequency-dependent facilitation by combining patch clamp and fluorimetric Ca2+ measurements in single neurosecretory terminals in thin slices of the rat posterior pituitary. In these terminals both action potential-induced changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and action potential duration were enhanced by high-frequency stimuli, all with a frequency dependence similar to that of hormone release. Furthermore, brief voltage clamp pulses inactivated a K+ current with a very similar frequency dependence. These results support a model for frequency-dependent facilitation in which the inactivation of a K+ current broadens action potentials, leading to an enhancement of [Ca2+]i signals. Further experiments tested for a causal relationship between action potential broadening and facilitation of [Ca2+]i changes. First, increasing the duration of depolarization, either by broadening action potentials with the K(+)-channel blocker tetraethylammonium or by applying longer depolarizing voltage clamp steps, increased [Ca2+]i changes. Second, eliminating frequency-dependent changes in duration, by voltage clamping the terminal with constant duration pulses, substantially reduced the frequency-dependent enhancement of [Ca2+]i changes. These results indicate that action potential broadening contributes to frequency-dependent facilitation of [Ca2+]i changes. However, the small residual frequency dependence of [Ca2+]i changes seen with constant duration stimulation suggests that a second process, distinct from action potential broadening, also contributes to facilitation. These two frequency-dependent mechanisms may also contribute to activity-dependent plasticity in synaptic terminals.\r"

  ".U": "91110534\r", 
  ".W": "A new variant form of hyperphenylalaninemia has recently been discovered in which the patients characteristically excrete 7-biopterin in their urines in addition to the natural 6-biopterin (Curtius, H. Ch., Kuster, T., Matasovic, A., Blau, N. & Dhondt, J.-L. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153, 715-721). This isomer had not been found previously in humans, and although its origin was not established, preliminary evidence suggested that it might be produced from 6-biopterin. We have now found that 7-biopterin can be formed in vitro from (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin during the hydroxylation of phenylalanine catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase [L-phenylalanine, tetrahydrobiopterin:oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.16.1]. The resulting 7-biopterin was unequivocally identified by the following criteria: preparative isolation and conversion to 7-hydroxymethylpterin following periodate oxidation and borohydride reduction, quantitative conversion to pterin-7-carboxylic acid after oxidation with permanganate, and liquid chromatography/thermospray mass spectrometry. Addition of 4a-carbinolamine dehydratase, an enzyme involved in the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin from the pterin carbinolamine intermediate (also called 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin) formed in the phenylalanine hydroxylase reaction, greatly decreased the amount of the 7-biopterin formed. This result implies that the in vitro formation of 7-biopterin occurs via the nonenzymatic rearrangement of the unstable substrate of the dehydratase, 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin, and suggests that this new variant of hyperphenylalaninemia may be caused by a lack of 4a-carbinolamine dehydratase activity. A mechanism for the rearrangement is proposed that predicts that other 6-substituted tetrahydropterin substrates of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases could also give rise to rearranged products from an opening of the pyrazine ring of the corresponding 4a-hydroxytetrahydropterin intermediate.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the molecular mechanism(s) by which the estrogen receptor (ER) modulates transcription, we compared the structures of receptor complexes containing estradiol, the agonist diethylstilbestrol, and the antagonist ICI164,384. The binding of ICI164,384 to nontransformed 8-9S ER does not preclude the salt-induced dissociation of the 90-kDa heat shock protein and releases the transformed homodimeric 5S ER as classically observed in the presence of agonist. We report that calf ER binds to the estrogen response element of the Xenopus vitellogenin A2 gene in either the absence or presence of hormone, agonist, or antagonist. These binding interactions were highly sequence- and receptor-specific. These findings indicate that ligand binding in vitro is not absolutely required for dimerization or specific DNA binding of the ER. As demonstrated by gel retardation assays, the ICI164,384-ER complex bound to the response element displays a slower mobility than complexes formed in the presence of estradiol or agonist. This difference in electrophoretic mobility is suggestive of a conformational change in the complex induced by the ligand. An exchange experiment demonstrated that this alteration of the structure is reversible. We suggest that ICI164,384 induces conformational modifications within the ligand-binding domain of the receptor that do not prevent binding to the response element but could fail to promote subsequent events required for gene transcription.\r"

We report here the molecular characterization of the bombesin/GRP receptor. Structural analysis of cDNA clones isolated from Swiss 3T3 murine embryonal fibroblasts shows that the GRP receptor is a member of the guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled receptor superfamily with seven predicted hydrophobic transmembrane domains. In vitro transcripts from cloned cDNA templates encompassing the predicted protein coding domain, when injected into Xenopus oocytes, resulted in expression of functional GRP receptors. The predicted amino acid sequence of the open reading frame in cDNA clones matches the amino-terminal sequence as well as the sequence of four tryptic fragments isolated from the purified protein. Expression of the GRP receptor cDNA in model systems potentially provides a powerful assay for the development of subtype-specific receptor antagonists that may prove to be of therapeutic importance in human small cell lung carcinoma.\r"

Microsequencing of the peptide showed that it contains an internal trypsin-resistant lysine residue, as expected for the site of adenylylation. Inhibition of DNA ligase I activity by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate also indicated the presence of a reactive lysine residue in the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Comparison of the known primary structures of several other DNA ligases with the adenylylated region of mammalian DNA ligase I allows their active sites to be tentatively assigned by sequence homology. The ATP-dependent DNA ligases of mammalian cells, fission yeast, budding yeast, vaccinia virus, and bacteriophages T3, T4, and T7 contain the active site motif Lys-Tyr/Ala-Asp-Gly-(Xaa)-Arg, with the reactive lysine residue flanked by hydrophobic amino acids. The distance between the postulated adenylylation site and the carboxyl terminus of the polypeptide is very similar in these ATP-dependent DNA ligases, whereas the size of the amino-terminal region is highly variable.\r"

This primer is formed by a ColE1 RNA II molecule that remains hybridized to its DNA template in the origin region after transcription. Continued hybridization is inhibited by prior binding to RNA II of another ColE1 transcript, RNA I; and this interaction is regulated by the plasmid-encoded Rom protein. To understand the quantitative aspects of regulation of ColE1 synthesis, we have measured the levels of RNA I, RNA II, and Rom protein in vivo, as well as the half-lives of the RNAs. The intracellular concentrations of RNA I, RNA II, and Rom protein were found to be about 1 microM, 7 nM, and 1 microM, respectively; and the RNAs had half-lives of about 2 min. A simple model derived from these results indicates that the plasmid copy number is little affected by the rate of RNA II synthesis but is strongly dependent on that of RNA I.\r"

Four mutants of human aromatase have been expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using a stable expression method. The activities of these mutants were determined using [1 beta,2 beta-3H]androstenedione, [19-14C]androstenedione, and [1 beta,2 beta-3H]testosterone as substrates. The mutant Phe-406----Arg was completely inactive. Since there were only small changes in the Km and Vmax values for all substrates for mutants Tyr-361----Phe and Tyr-361----Leu, the residue Tyr-361 appears not to be directly involved in the substrate binding. The mutant Pro-308----Phe had altered catalytic properties; the Km values for androstenedione, but not testosterone, decreased significantly. These results, along with those obtained from inhibition studies with aromatase inhibitors, 4-hydroxyandrostenedione and aminoglutethimide, suggest that Pro-308 is probably situated in the active site of the enzyme and may be interacting with the D ring of the steroids.\r"

Simulations were performed on the non-metal-bound crystal structure, the form resulting from addition of eight calcium ions to the 1-65 region of the crystal structure, the form resulting from removal of calcium ions after 107 ps and continuing the simulation, and an isolated hexapeptide loop (residues 18-23). In all cases, the 100-ps time scale seemed adequate to sample an ensemble of solution conformers within a particular region of conformation space. The non-metal-containing BF1 did not unfold appreciably during a 106-ps simulation starting from the crystallographic geometry. The calcium ion-containing structure (Ca-BF1) underwent an interesting conformational reorganization during its evolution from the crystal structure: during the time course of a 107-ps simulation, Ca-BF1 experienced a trans----cis isomerization of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-21 (Gla-21)-Pro-22 peptide bond. Removal of the calcium ions from this structure followed by 114 ps of additional molecular dynamics showed significant unfolding relative to the final 20-ps average structure of the 107-ps simulation; however, the Gla-21-Pro-22 peptide bond remained cis. A 265-ps simulation on the termini-protected hexapeptide loop (Cys-18 to Cys-23) containing two calcium ions also did not undergo a trans----cis isomerization. It is believed that the necessary activation energy for the transitional event observed in the Ca-BF1 simulation was largely supplied by global conformational events with a possible assist from relief of intermolecular crystal packing forces. The presence of a Gla preceding Pro-22, the inclusion of Pro-22 in a highly strained loop structure, and the formation of two long-lived salt bridges prior to isomerization may all contribute to this finding.\r"

The physiological action of histamine has been shown to be mediated via a guanine nucleotide-binding protein linked to adenylate cyclase activation and cellular cAMP generation. We capitalized on the technique of polymerase chain reaction, using degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on the known homology between cellular receptors linked to guanine nucleotide-binding proteins to obtain a partial-length clone from canine gastric parietal cell cDNA. This clone was used to obtain a full-length receptor gene from a canine genomic library. Histamine increased in a dose-dependent manner cellular cAMP content in L cells permanently transfected with this gene, and preincubation of the cells with the H2-selective antagonist cimetidine shifted the dose-response curve to the right. Cimetidine inhibited the binding of the radiolabeled H2 receptor-selective ligand [methyl-3H]tiotidine to the transfected cells in a dose-dependent fashion, but the H1-selective antagonist diphenhydramine did not. These data indicate that we have cloned a gene that encodes the H2 subclass of histamine receptors.\r"

A dimensionless packing parameter, S, given by S = V/al, where V is the hydrocarbon volume, a is the area of the head group, and l is the critical length of the hydrocarbon chain, is useful in determining the phase preference of a lipid, and the value of S usually lies between 0.5 and 1 for bilayers. Here, the value of S is calculated for phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) as a function of chain length, and it is shown that diacylPC having an S value of less than 0.74 does not form bilayers. For example, diacylPC, up to a chain length of eight carbon atoms, forms only micelles, whereas higher homologs with S greater than 0.74 form bilayers. It is also shown that when lipid molecules having complementary shapes associate, the value of S becomes additive. Using the additivity of S, a number of experimental results for lipid mixtures can be explained. For example, lysoPC and cholesterol form lamellar structures between 45 and approximately 80 mol% cholesterol, and the additive value of S for this region is between 0.74 and 1. Similarly, the additivity of S shows that the maximum amount of cholesterol that can be incorporated into PC bilayers is 50 mol%, in agreement with experimental studies.\r"

  ".W": "Deletion of Glu-84, Glu-83 and Glu-84, or Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu (residues 81-84) from the central helix of mammalian calmodulin is known to result in a 5-7 times decrease in its apparent in vitro affinities for three calmodulin-dependent enzymes. However, based on in vitro experiments, it is difficult to estimate how these deletions might affect in vivo cellular function. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which requires calmodulin for growth, provides an excellent system to evaluate these deletion proteins in vivo. Based on its ability to restore normal growth characteristics to yeast cells, mammalian calmodulin is functionally identical to the yeast protein; herein we evaluate the effect of deleting residues 84, 83 and 84, or 81-84 from the central helix. Sequences encoding the deletion proteins and an unaltered control sequence were introduced by means of a yeast shuttle vector and were expressed under control of the yeast calmodulin promoter. The deletion and control calmodulins are produced at levels similar to that observed for the yeast protein, and they completely restore normal growth characteristics. This result suggests that the regions deleted from the central helix are not critical for activation of any yeast calmodulin target normally required for cell growth or division. It is likely that there are twisting and shortening motions associated with the deletions from the central helix that alter significantly the spatial relationship between the two lobes of calmodulin. The abilities of the deletion calmodulins to restore completely normal growth characteristics to yeast cells suggest that the lobes of all the deletion proteins can still be appropriately positioned in calmodulin-target complexes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the central helix of calmodulin is analogous to a flexible tether rather than to a rigid connector between the two lobes of the molecule.\r"

The 1.3-kilobase (kb) cDNA contains an open reading frame which encompasses a 143-amino acid sequence which is 89% identical to the rat SCP2 amino acid sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of the polypeptide reveals a 20-residue amino-terminal leader sequence in front of the mature polypeptide, which contains a carboxyl-terminal tripeptide (Ala-Lys-Leu) related to the peroxisome targeting sequence. The expressed cDNA in COS-7 cells yields a 15.3-kDa polypeptide and increased amounts of a 13.2-kDa polypeptide, both reacting with a specific rabbit antiserum to rat liver SCP2. The cDNA insert hybridizes with 3.2- and 1.8-kb mRNA species in human liver poly(A)+ RNA. In human fibroblasts and placenta the 1.8-kb mRNA was most abundant. Southern blot analysis suggests either that there are multiple copies of the SCP2 gene in the human genome or that the SCP2 gene is very large. Coexpression of the SCP2 cDNA with expression vectors for cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and adrenodoxin resulted in a 2.5-fold enhancement of progestin synthesis over that obtained with expression of the steroidogenic enzyme system alone. These findings are concordant with the notion that SCP2 plays a role in regulating steroidogenesis, among other possible functions.\r"

We have previously proposed that the IRA genes, negative regulators of RAS genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encode yeast homologs of the mammalian GAP. In this paper, we present the following evidence that a product of the IRA2 gene exhibits GAP activity similar to that of the mammalian GAP protein. (i) Extracts of yeast cells overexpressing IRA2 stimulated the GTPase activity of the yeast RAS2 protein. (ii) An epitope for a monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was added to the N terminus of the IRA2 protein. The GAP activity of extracts prepared from cells expressing this fusion protein was shown to be immunoprecipitable by 12CA5. (iii) An IRA2 protein fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was produced and partially purified from Escherichia coli cells. GAP activity was detected with this purified GST-IRA2 fusion protein. (iv) The GAP activity of IRA2 proteins described above did not stimulate the GTPase activity of the RAS2Val19 protein, a protein having an amino acid alteration analogous to that found in mammalian oncogenic ras proteins. This result parallels studies showing that mammalian GAP is incapable of stimulating the GTPase activity of mammalian oncogenic proteins. The remarkable conservation between the GAP activity in mammalian and yeast cells supports the idea that the function of GAP is to negatively regulate ras proteins in mammalian cells.\r"

The decay of the M form is characterized by the disappearance of the ethylenic bands and the bands indicating the reprotonation of the Schiff base. The route of Schiff-base reprotonation completely changes between 240 K and 260 K. At 240 K reprotonation occurs from Asp-85, the group to which the proton was released during M formation, and there is no pumping. At 260 K Schiff-base reprotonation takes place through Asp-96 from the cytoplasmic side, in the normal sequence assumed for proton pumping. The dramatic change in the route of Schiff-base reprotonation is coupled to a protein conformational change characterized by the change of the ratio of the two amide I bands at 1658 cm-1 and 1669 cm-1. This conformational change is interpreted as the conformational switch crucial for proton pumping: a protein relaxation following M formation results in a local rearrangement of the group, in the vicinity of the Schiff base. The rearrangement changes the accessibility of the Schiff base and provides that its deprotonation and reprotonation occur on different sides. The conformational change has characteristics typical for relaxations in proteins. In addition, it is shown that at 260 K an equilibrium exists between the M and N forms.\r"

Several heterologous introns placed 3' of the coding region of an intronless rat growth hormone gene are also ineffective. However, insertion of some heterologous introns between the metallothionein promoter and the growth hormone gene improves expression. To determine whether addition of heterologous introns would provide a general strategy for improving expression, we have tested them in conjunction with other intronless genes and with different promoters.\r"

Genetic analyses of this mutant have indicated that a single-base-pair change has replaced Gly-158 of cyt b with Asp. In this work, Gly-158 was changed by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis to several other amino acids to define its role on quinol oxidation catalyzed by the cyt bc1 complex. The effects of the mutations were analyzed by measuring the photosynthetic growth rate of mutants and the activity of their cyt bc1 complexes. The mutants overproduced the cyt bc1 complex, assembled its subunits, and incorporated its prosthetic groups as shown by immunoblotting and optical difference spectroscopy. Of 14 amino acid residues tested at position 158 of cyt b all but alanine and serine resulted in a marked decrease of cyt bc1 activity and failed to support photosynthetic growth of R. capsulatus. The photosynthesis-competent mutants, Gly-158----Ala and Gly-158----Ser, had lower cyt bc1 complex activities that were resistant to myxothiazol, but not to stigmatellin, quinol oxidation inhibitors. These findings indicated that the specific role of Gly-158 of cyt b on quinol oxidation and myxothiazol binding may be related to the small size of its side chain and are discussed in terms of the structure and function of the quinol oxidation site of the cyt bc1 complex.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that glycolytic enzymes form multienzyme complexes for direct transfer of metabolites from the producing enzyme to the utilizing one. Reexamination of the supporting evidence, which involves the transfer of NADH between its complexes with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, GPDH; EC 1.1.1.8) and with L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1.1.1.27), has shown that the supporting evidence is based on misinterpretation of the kinetics of ligand exchange. Srivastava et al. have responded with a revision of their own and criticism of our data. To clarify this problem, we have carried out detailed kinetic studies on NADH binding to GPHD and LDH and on the displacement of enzyme-bound NADH by LDH or GPDH. The experiments were conducted at 10 degrees C in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5/100 mM KCl/1 mM EDTA/1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, using rabbit muscle GPDH and LDH. The results show that the kinetic patterns exhibited by the displacement of NADH-bound enzyme by either GPDH or LDH are consistent with a dissociative mechanism but not with a direct transfer mechanism. Theoretical analysis shows that a combined dissociative and direct transfer mechanism can explain the transient kinetic data reported by Srivastava et al. if, and only if, a majority (approximately 90%) of the enzyme present in lower concentration exists as a complex with the second enzyme. However, data from tracer and traditional sedimentation equilibrium and from gel filtration experiments show that LDH and GPDH do not form complexes in the presence of saturating NADH concentration when the enzyme concentrations are ranged between 4 and 50 microM, a concentration equal to or greater than that used by Srivastava et al. Our results demonstrate that GPDH and LDH do not form multienzyme complex and the transfer of NADH between these enzymes proceeds via a dissociative mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "91110557\r", 
  ".W": "To study the mechanism of arrest of DNA synthesis at d(TC)n and d(GA)n sequences, single-stranded DNA molecules including d(TC)27 or d(TC)31 tracts or a d(GA)27 tract were used as templates for in vitro assays of complementary DNA synthesis performed by extension of a primer with the Klenow polymerase or the Taq polymerase (Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase). Electrophoresis of the products revealed that arrests occurred around the middle of these tracts. The arrests in the d(TC)n sequences were eliminated when dATP or dGTP was replaced with the analogue 7-deaza dATP or 7-deaza dGTP, respectively, or when the templates were preincubated with the Escherichia coli single-strand binding protein (SSB). Preincubation of the template including a d(GA)27 tract with SSB has also eliminated the arrests at this sequence. Furthermore, arrests did not occur at d[G(7-deaza A)]27 or d[(7-deaza G)A]27 tracts when molecules including such tracts were used as templates. These results are compatible with the notion that the arrests were caused by formation of d(TC)i.d(GA)i.d(TC)i and d(GA)i.d(GA)i.d(TC)i triplexes, in which the bases in the uncopied portions of the d(TC)n tracts, or of the d(GA)27 tract, and the purine bases in the newly synthesized d(TC)i.d(GA)i duplexes were bound by hydrogen bonds. In the assays performed with the Taq polymerase, the pH dependence (in the range of 6.0-9.0) and the temperature dependence of the arrests were determined. As the pH was lowered, the arrests in the d(TC)27 tract were enhanced, in line with the expected properties of d(TC)i.d(GA)i.d(TC)i triplexes. The arrests in the d(GA)27 tract were enhanced by an increase in the pH. At pH 7.2 the arrests in the d(GA)27 tract persisted up to 80 degrees C, whereas the arrests in the d(TC)27 tract were eliminated at 50 degrees C; these results presumably reflect the relative stabilities of the two triplexes mentioned above at this physiological pH value and could be biologically significant.\r"

This enabled us to draw phylogenetic trees for species whose phylogeny cannot be easily reconstructed from the fossil record. Our calculation of the times of divergence of the various organelle-specific enzymes led us to hypothesize that the pea and bean chloroplast genes for these enzymes originated from the duplication of nuclear genes as a result of the different metabolic needs of the various species. Our data indicate that the duplication of plastid glutamine synthetase genes occurred long after the endosymbiotic events that produced the organelles themselves.\r"

In fact, IFNs inhibit growth of various normal and transformed cell types. Previously, a nuclear factor, IRF-1 (interferon regulatory factor 1), which binds to type I IFN and some IFN-inducible gene promoters, was identified and cloned. Since the IRF-1 gene is both virus and IFN inducible, an intriguing issue is raised as to whether the IRF-1 gene is functioning in IFN-mediated regulation of cell growth and differentiation. In this study, we generated transgenic mice carrying the human IRF-1 gene linked to the human immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer. In the transgenic mice, all the lymphoid tissues examined showed a dramatic reduction in the number of B lymphocytes (B cells). Preparation and analysis of bone marrow cells from the chimeric mice indicated that the bone marrow is the effective site for specific depletion of the B-cell population. In fact, transgenic bone marrow cells cocultured with a bone marrow-derived stromal cell line revealed an altered B-cell maturation pattern.\r"

The animals were challenged i.v. with 40 chimpanzee infectious doses (equivalent to 100 tissue culture 50% infectious doses) of a stock of HIV-1 IIIB isolate. After 6 mo of follow-up, all three animals appeared uninfected by serologic and virologic criteria, including polymerase chain reaction analysis and failure to isolate virus from peripheral blood lymphocytes, bone marrow, and lymph node tissue. Of two chimpanzees monitored for 1 yr, virus was isolated initially from one animal at 32 weeks, but the second chimpanzee was virus negative by all assays through 12 mo; the third animal has remained virus negative through 9 mo of follow-up. These results indicate that it is possible to elicit protection against, or significantly delay infection of, HIV-1 by immunization, thus laying the foundation for development of an HIV-1 vaccine.\r"

A common form of multidrug resistance in human cancer results from expression of the MDR1 gene, which encodes a Mr 170,000 glycoprotein that functions as a plasma membrane energy-dependent multidrug efflux pump. We have engineered transgenic mice that express this multidrug transporter in their bone marrow and demonstrated that these animals are resistant to leukopenia by a panel of anticancer drugs including anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, etoposide, taxol, and actinomycin D. Differential leukocyte counts indicate that both neutrophils and lymphocytes are protected. Drugs such as cisplatin, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil, which are not handled by the multidrug transporter, produce bone marrow suppression in both normal and transgenic mice. The resistance conferred by the MDR1 gene can be circumvented in a dose-dependent manner by simultaneous administration of agents previously shown to be inhibitors of the multidrug transporter in vitro, including verapamil isomers, quinidine, and quinine. Verapamil and quinine, both at levels suitable for human trials that produced only partial sensitization of the MDR1-transgenic mice, were fully sensitizing when used in combination. We conclude that MDR1-transgenic mice provide a rapid and reliable system to determine the bioactivity of agents that reverse multidrug resistance in animals.\r"

Guinea pig CS (10(-9) M) added to villus cells in Na(+)-containing medium reduced volume, but immediate cell swelling was caused by 10(-6) M guinea pig CS. In Na(+)-free N-methyl-D-glucamine-containing medium 10(-9) M guinea pig CS accelerated the initial rate of shrinkage compared with cells in N-methyl-D-glucamine-containing medium alone as well as causing greater cell shrinkage. Guinea pig CS-stimulated cell shrinkage was prevented by a Ca2(+)-channel blocker--5 microM nifedipine, by chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with 100 microM EGTA, or by omega-conotoxin (10(-9) M). The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (2.5 microM) reduced volume when added to villus cells in N-methyl-D-glucamine-containing medium; this action was prevented by EGTA, or quinine--an inhibitor of K+ conductance, or 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid--a Cl- channel blocker, suggesting that the volume reduction occurred because K+ and Cl- conductances were activated. Guinea pig CS-stimulated volume reduction was also prevented by 100 microM quinine or 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid. We conclude that jejunal villus enterocytes possess a Ca2(+)-activated Cl- conductance and a K+ conductance that need not be stretch-activated. Corticostatic peptides cause volume reduction in villus cells by activating L-type Ca2+ channels; other defensin-like peptides were without effect.\r"

In this study we have demonstrated with in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry the reversible expression of c-sis/PDGF-2 and PDGF receptor (PDGF-R) b mRNAs and their respective protein products in epithelial cells and fibroblasts following cutaneous injury in pigs. Epithelial cells in control, unwounded skin did not express c-sis and PDGF-R mRNAs, and fibroblasts expressed only PDGF-R mRNA. The expression levels in the injured site were correlated with the stage of tissue repair, being highest during the initial stages of the repair process and declining at the time of complete re-epithelialization and tissue remodeling. It is suggested that the controlled, reversible expression of a potent mitogen and its receptor induced by injury may function in an autocrine/paracrine manner on both epithelial cells and fibroblasts to bring about their sustained proliferation during the normal healing process. These studies provide a molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms contributing to normal tissue repair. We suggest the possibility that a defect in these mechanisms may be associated with defective wound healing. It is also conceivable that \"chronic\" injury may induce irreversible gene expression leading to pathologic, unregulated cell growth.\r"

Cells of cell line FEP-1811 were nontumorigenic in athymic mice through at least 12 passages in culture, but after 32 passages were weakly tumorigenic, producing tumors that regressed. After 62 passages they produced invasive squamous cell carcinomas that grew progressively. The progression to malignancy was associated with an increase in the efficiency of forming colonies in soft agar and with altered differentiation properties. In an organotypic culture system, FEP-1811 cells at passages 12 and 32 exhibited features typical of premalignant intraepithelial neoplasia in vivo, and cells at passage 68 exhibited features consistent with squamous cell carcinomas. No change in copy number of the transfected HPV-18 genome or in the level of expression of the viral transforming gene products E6 and E7 was detected between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells. Cytogenetic analysis of cells at early, middle, and late passage levels and cells cultured from tumors revealed that several chromosomal abnormalities segregated with the tumorigenic cell populations.\r"

  ".U": "91110572\r", 
  ".W": "The activation of latent transforming growth factor beta (LTGF-beta) normally seen in cocultures of bovine aortic endothelial and bovine smooth muscle cells can be inhibited by coculturing the cells with either mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) or antibodies directed against the cation-independent Man-6-P/insulin-like growth factor type II receptor (anti-Man-6-PR). This result was established by measuring the ability of coculture conditioned medium (formed with or without Man-6-P or anti-Man-6-PR) to suppress bovine aortic endothelial cell migration and protease production, activities previously shown to be related to transforming growth factor beta activity. The inhibition by Man-6-P is dose dependent, with maximal inhibition seen at 100 microM and is specific because mannose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate do not interfere with activation of LTGF-beta. The inhibitory effect of anti-Man-6-PR is also specific and dose dependent; maximal inhibition of activation occurs at 400 micrograms/ml. Control experiments indicate that Man-6-P and anti-Man-6-PR do not interfere with the basal level of migration of bovine aortic endothelial cells, the migration observed when exogenous transforming growth factor beta is added, the activation of transforming growth factor beta by plasmin or transient acidification, and the release of LTGF-beta. Thus, binding to the cation-independent Man-6-P/insulin-like growth factor type II receptor appears to be a requirement for activation of LTGF-beta.\r"

  ".W": "The conformation of the self-complementary B-DNA decamer C-C-A-A-C-G-T-T-G-G is known from a high-resolution x-ray crystal structure analysis. Molecular dynamics simulation of the hydration shell of the decamer has revealed two main types of minor-groove hydration, depending on groove width. The narrow part of the minor groove has a spine of hydration analogous to that described for the A + T-rich center of the minor groove in the dodecamer C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-C-G-C-G [Drew, H. R. & Dickerson, R. E. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 151, 535-556], the first hydration layer of which contains one water molecular per base pair. In contrast, in the wide part of the minor groove, each base is hydrated individually, water molecules lying predominantly in the base plane. In intermediate-width regions, preferred water-molecule sites are shifted away from the base plane in a 3'-to-5' direction. This shift becomes more pronounced as the minor groove narrows, until the two water molecules lie approximately midway between base pairs. If the minor groove is narrowed still further, it accommodates only one water molecule, and the hydration transforms to the well-known water spine. The observed pattern agrees with available crystallographic data and with our earlier calculations. The results confirm the assumption that preferred positions of water oxygens in the minor groove depend predominantly on groove width rather than on base sequence. However, the location of water hydrogens, and the network of hydrogen bonding, can depend on base sequence. We suggest a simple explanation of water-spine formation in the narrow minor groove of a random DNA sequence. The spine of hydration may be a property of the minor groove of overwound variants of B-DNA, the C and D forms, for which the middle part of the decamer C-C-A-A-C-G-T-T-G-G can serve as a model.\r"

  ".W": "We are using a Rat-6 fibroblast cell line that stably overexpresses the beta 1 isozyme of protein kinase C (PKC) to study regulation of phospholipid hydrolysis by PKC. Stimulation of control (R6-C1) or overexpressing (R6-PKC3) cells with phorbol ester results in an increase in diacylglycerol (DAG) mass with no increase in inositol phosphates, indicating that DAG is not formed by inositol phospholipid breakdown. A more dramatic DAG increase occurs in R6-PKC3 cells (4.0-fold over basal) compared to R6-C1 cells (1.5-fold over basal). To further define the source of DAG, phosphatidylcholine (PC) pools were labeled with [3H]myristic acid or with [3H]- or [32P]alkyllyso-PC and formation of labeled phosphatidylethanol, an unambiguous marker of phospholipase D activation, was monitored. Phorbol ester-stimulated phosphatidylethanol formation is 5-fold greater in the R6-PKC3 cell line. Formation of radiolabeled phosphatidic acid (PA) is also enhanced by PKC overexpression. In cells double-labeled with [3H]- and [32P]-alkyl-lysoPC, the 3H/32P ratio of PA and PC are identical 15 min after stimulation, suggesting that a phospholipase D mechanism predominates. In support of this, the PA phosphohydrolase inhibitor propranolol decreased phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated DAG formation by 72%. Increases in DAG and phosphatidylethanol were inhibited by the PKC inhibitors K252a and staurosporine. These results indicate that phospholipase D is regulated by the action of PKC. Enhanced phospholipase D activity may contribute to the growth abnormalities seen in PKC-overexpressing cells.\r"

  ".U": "91110576\r", 
  ".W": "The human CD7 molecule is a 40-kDa member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily that is expressed on T-lymphoid and myeloid precursors in fetal liver and bone marrow. CD7 is also expressed on T lymphocytes in multiple stages of T-cell development, including a major subset of mature peripheral T cells. In this paper we report the isolation and characterization of the human CD7 gene and 5' flanking region. Sequence analysis revealed that the CD7 gene comprises four exons that span 3.5 kilobases. The 5' flanking region (506 base pairs) has a high G + C content and no \"TATA\" or \"CCAAT\" elements. DNase I sensitivity analysis of chromatin from the CD7+ progenitor cell leukemia line, DU528, and the CD7-, CD4+, CD8+, TCR alpha beta + T-cell line, DU980 (where TCR is the T-cell receptor), revealed two distinct hypersensitive sites 5' of the CD7 gene. Hypersensitive site 1, present in the DU980 T-cell line, was located 4.5 kilobases upstream of the presumed CD7 transcription initiation site. Only DNase I hypersensitive site 2, which mapped to the promoter region, was found in the DU528 line. Comparison of the organization of the CD7 gene with that of other members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily revealed that the human CD7 gene most closely resembles the murine Thy-1 gene. Both CD7 and Thy-1 are encoded by small genes with four exons, contain TATA-less promoters, and have a similar functional organization. These structural similarities suggest that human CD7 and murine Thy-1 may be functional homologues.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with peptide antigen plus major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein requires both alpha and beta chains of the TCR. The \"superantigens\" are a group of molecules that are recognized in association with MHC class II but that do not appear to conform to this pattern. Superantigens are defined as such because they cause the activation or thymic deletion of many or all T cells bearing specific TCR beta-chain variable region (V beta) elements. The strong association of particular V beta S with T-cell responses to superantigens suggests that their interaction with the TCR is fundamentally different from that of most antigens. We have directly investigated the involvement of the beta chain in recognition of a superantigen by using a secreted, truncated TCR beta chain and the bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A complexed to cell-surface MHC class II. We demonstrate that this interaction is specific for the enterotoxin and is dependent on MHC class II expression by the cell. The reaction can be inhibited by antibodies against the three components of the reaction: V beta, enterotoxin, and class II. This shows that the TCR beta chain is sufficient to mediate the interaction with a superantigen-class II complex. The TCR alpha chain and co-receptors such as CD4 are not required.\r"

  ".W": "Growth hormone (GH) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We sought to determine whether this could be mediated by an effect of GH on proliferation of endothelial cells, and, for this purpose, established long-term cultures of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hREC) from normal postmortem human eyes. High-purity (greater than 95%) hREC preparations were selected for experiments, based on immunofluorescence with acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL) and anti-factor VIII-related antigen. Growth requirements for these cells were complex, including serum for maintenance at slow growth rates and additional mitogens for more rapid proliferation. Exposure of hREC to physiologic doses of human GH (hGH) resulted in 100% greater cell number vs. control (P less than 0.01) but could be elicited only in the presence of serum. When differing serum conditions were compared, hGH stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation up to 1.6- to 2.2-fold under each condition and increased DNA content significantly in the presence of human, horse, and fetal calf serum. Depending on the culture conditions used, the threshold hGH concentration for significant stimulation of hREC proliferation was 0.4-4 micrograms/liter. In contrast, proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was not significantly altered by hGH added to concentrations as high as 200 micrograms/liter. In summary, hREC respond to physiologic concentrations of hGH in vitro with enhanced proliferation. This specific effect of GH on retinal microvascular endothelial cells supports the hypothesis of a role for GH in endothelial cell biology.\r"

Starting with phases from the protein and a flat solvent model, the difference map calculated from the data was added outside the protein envelope, and the modified map was then used to recalculate phases for the iterative refinement. Tests of the method with model data, with the experimental data and a variant protein model, and by carrying out a partial refinement of the solvent map demonstrate that the refinement algorithm produces reliable values for the solvent density within the noise level of the data. Fluctuations in density are observed throughout the solvent space, demonstrating that nonrandom arrangements of the water molecules extend several layers from the well-ordered hydration shell in contact with the protein surface. Such ordering may account for the hydration force opposing close approach of hydrophilic surfaces and other long-range water-dependent interactions in living structures.\r"

The SH2 probe bound almost exclusively to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, and binding was eliminated by dephosphorylation of cell proteins. Free phosphotyrosine could partially disrupt SH2 binding, suggesting that phosphotyrosine is directly involved in the binding interaction. These results demonstrate that an SH2 domain is sufficient to confer direct, high-affinity phosphotyrosine-dependent binding to proteins and suggest a general role for SH2 domains in cellular signaling pathways.\r"

We have identified and sequenced a DNA region from B. japonicum strain USDA 110 which is involved in genotype-specific nodulation of soybeans. This 2.3-kilobase region, cloned in pMJS12, allows B. japonicum serocluster 123 isolates to form nodules on plants of serogroup 123-restricting genotypes. The nodules, however, were ineffective for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The nodulation-complementing region is located approximately 590 base pairs transcriptionally downstream from nodD2. The 5' end of pMJS12 contains a putative open reading frame (ORF) of 710 base pairs, termed nolA. Transposon Tn3-HoHo mutations only within the ORF abolished nodulation complementation. The N terminus of the predicted nolA gene product has strong similarity with the N terminus of MerR, the regulator of mercury resistance genes. Translational lacZ fusion experiments indicated that nolA was moderately induced by soybean seed extract and the isoflavone genistein. Restriction fragments that hybridize to pMJS12 were detected in genomic DNAs from both nodulation-restricted and -unrestricted strains.\r"

We found that cell lines EA2 and ET, which express markers of cortical epithelial cells, produce interleukin 7 mRNA and after being injected into the spleens of young athymic nude mice support in vivo generation of CD4+CD8- T-cell receptor alpha beta+ T lymphocytes (ET line) or both CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ T-cell receptor alpha beta+ T cells (EA2 line). Both cell lines also supported generation of T-cell receptor gamma delta+ T cells but appear not to support development of double-positive (CD4+CD8+) cells. One cell line, EB3, which expresses markers of medullary epithelial cells, produces interleukin 1 alpha RNA transcripts but does not support T-lymphocyte differentiation. The results provide direct evidence for functional heterogeneity of thymic epithelial cells in vivo and show the involvement of different cortical epithelial cells in the differentiation of T-cell progenitors into distinct thymocyte subsets.\r"

In support of the potential role of autoimmunity in ALS, two immune-mediated animal models of motoneuron disease have been developed that resemble ALS with respect to the loss of motoneurons, the presence of IgG within motoneurons and at the neuromuscular junction, and with respect to altered physiology of the motor nerve terminal. To provide direct evidence for the primary role of humoral immunity, passive transfer with immunoglobulins from the two animal models and human ALS was carried out. Mice injected with serum or immunoglobulins from the animal disease models and human ALS but not controls demonstrated IgG in motoneurons and at the neuromuscular junction. The mice also demonstrated an increase in miniature end-plate potential (mepp) frequency, with normal amplitude and time course and normal resting membrane potential, indicating an increased resting quantal release of acetylcholine from the nerve terminal. The ability to transfer motoneuron dysfunction with serum immunoglobulins provides evidence for autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of both the animal models and human ALS.\r"

Little is known concerning the levels and distribution of adenosine and related purines in the extracellular fluid of the heart. We have measured epicardial and endocardial levels of adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, AMP, and IMP in isolated constant flow perfused guinea pig hearts by using a recently developed technique with porous nylon sampling discs. Venous effluent purine levels were also measured. Concentrations of all purines measured, excluding IMP, were significantly higher in endocardial fluid samples than in epicardial fluid samples (P less than 0.05). Conversely, IMP levels were significantly lower in endocardial than in epicardial samples. The magnitude of the endocardial/epicardial ratios for adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, AMP, and IMP were approximately 12:1, 4:1, 5:1, 4:1, and 1:2, respectively. To assess cellular damage, lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured in all fluid samples and was not significantly different in endocardial and epicardial fluid. These data support the existence of significant transmural gradients for extracellular purine levels in crystalloid perfused guinea pig hearts. Transmural differences in vasoactive adenosine levels may be partially due to the greater endocardial oxygen consumption and metabolism and may be involved in maintaining relatively high subendocardial blood flows in the face of high intramyocardial pressures.\r"

Mixed oligonucleotide primers whose sequences were deduced from one tryptic peptide obtained from purified CPTase were used in a polymerase chain reaction, allowing the amplification of a 0.12-kilobase fragment of human genomic DNA encoding such a peptide. A 60-base-pair (bp) oligonucleotide synthesized on the basis of the sequence from this fragment was used for the screening of a cDNA library from human liver and hybridized to a cDNA insert of 2255 bp. This cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1974 bp that encodes a protein of 658 amino acid residues including 25 residues of an NH2-terminal leader peptide. The assignment of this open reading frame to human liver CPTase is confirmed by matches to seven different amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides derived from pure human CPTase and by the 82.2% homology with the amino acid sequence of rat CPTase. The NH2-terminal region of CPTase contains a leucine-proline motif that is shared by carnitine acetyl- and octanoyltransferases and by choline acetyltransferase. The gene encoding CPTase was assigned to human chromosome 1, region 1q12-1pter, by hybridization of CPTase cDNA with a DNA panel of 19 human-hamster somatic cell hybrids.\r"

Each individual hairpin forms with mismatched base pairs, one containing two GT pairs and the other containing two AC pairs. The conformational transition is stabilized by proton transfer to the hairpin containing AC mismatched pairs.

  ".W": "We have developed a method for amplifying DNA fragments containing tandem arrays of \"zinc-finger\" sequences of the transcription factor IIIA (Cys2-His2) type by using the polymerase chain reaction. Because these sequences occur as tandem arrays, a ladder of bands is produced upon amplification using primers derived from the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences of a zinc-finger domain. The \"rungs\" of this ladder correspond to DNA fragments encoding one zinc-finger domain, two adjacent zinc-finger domains, and so on. This is demonstrated by isolating individual bands corresponding to n zinc-finger domains and reamplifying them with the same primers. This yields a band of the original size as well as bands corresponding to 1 through (n - 1) zinc-finger domains. Direct evidence that these bands encode zinc-finger domains was obtained by cloning and sequencing a collection of the amplification products. Due to the lack of redundancy in the sequences obtained, we conclude that each band corresponds to a large number of unique zinc-finger-encoding sequences. The results from amplification reaction mixtures using genomic DNA from a variety of sources as template provide further evidence that zinc-finger domains occur widely and frequently in eukaryotic genomes. We believe that this method is a powerful technique for the isolation and characterization of zinc-finger-encoding genes.\r"

  ".W": "The predicted amino acid sequence of the cDNA encoding the murine B-lymphocyte differentiation antigen BP-1/6C3 suggested that it is a member of the zinc-dependent metalloprotease family, possibly an aminopeptidase related to aminopeptidase N [microsomal aminopeptidase; alpha-aminoacyl-peptide hydrolase (microsomal), EC 3.4.11.2]. In the present studies, we examined the enzymatic activity of this antigen. From brush border preparations of the small intestine, a rich source of many endopeptidases and exopeptidases, the BP-1 antibody selectively removed aminopeptidase A [APA; L-alpha-aspartyl(L-alpha-glutamyl)-peptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.11.7] activity. The APA activity of a panel of cell lines correlated in linear fashion with cell-surface levels of the BP-1/6C3 antigen. APA activity was demonstrated for the BP-1/6C3 antigen immunopurified from the pre-B-cell membrane. This activity was enhanced by alkaline earth metals such as Ca2+ and was abrogated by amastatin and angiotensin, which are known competitive inhibitors of APA. The data indicate that the murine BP-1/6C3 antigen is active APA, an enzyme that catalyzes specifically the removal of unsubstituted, N-terminal glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues from peptides.\r"

With this goal in mind, the interrater reliability of therapists to make visual judgments from graphed data that included a trend line was examined. Thirty therapists were presented with 24 graphs of single-subject data from AB (baseline-treatment) designs. Each graph included a trend line calculated using the split-middle method of trend estimation. The trend line was computed using the baseline data and then extended into the treatment phase to \"predict\" patient performance. The analysis, using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), revealed low interrater agreement, with ICC values ranging from .37 to .55 for the entire sample. Evidence is presented that the statistical backgrounds of some raters positively influenced interrater reliability. No statistically significant relationship was found between interrater agreement and visual components of the graphed data, such as changes in slope or variability.\r"

Particular emphasis is placed on recent research regarding the effects of selected KR variations (KR relative frequency, bandwidth KR, and KR delay) on motor performance and learning in healthy young adults. Results are discussed in terms of short-lasting temporary performance effects and relatively long-lasting learning effects. Theoretical and practical implications from this research are discussed. It is suggested that it is appropriate to use the principles obtained through laboratory experimentation as guidelines rather than as exact recommendations when applying basic research findings to clinical practice.\r"

Measurements were made on 60 patients with orthopedic disorders of the cervical spine who were divided into three groups of 20 subjects each. All subjects were tested in a standardized seated position using operationally defined goniometric placements and nongoniometric estimation techniques. Cervical flexion and extension, lateral flexion, and rotation were measured. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to quantify within-tester and between-tester reliability. We found that goniometric measurements of AROM of the cervical spine made by the same physical therapist had ICCs greater than .80 when made with the CROM device or the UG. When different physical therapist measured the same patient's cervical AROM, the CROM device had ICCs greater than .80, whereas the UG and VE generally had ICCs less than .80.\r"

  ".U": "91110746\r", 
  ".W": "The idea of autologous fat microtransplants has recently resurfaced because of interest by the press. Past experiments have shown that small amounts of fat may be transplanted with an expected survival rate between 10 and 50 percent without ectodermis. A great fund of knowledge exists showing that skin grafts will survive quite dependably if their thickness is up to about 0.0020 inch. For the first week or so, they live by diffusion and inosculation, and then neovascularization enables them to continue viability. I have developed a technique whereby fat is harvested through a blunt cannula with minimal vacuum to prevent explosion of the cellular fat globules. Fibrin and cellular debris are removed, and the fat globules are separated from the free fat, blood, and other constituents of the aspirate. Individual, free-floating 1- to 3-mm adipose fragments are then suspended in nutrient solution and injected through an 18-gauge needle. Multiple radial pathways, with each fat segment being separated from the other by host tissue, maximizes the host-prosthesis interface and the possibility for exchange of nutrients. I have attempted this procedure in more than 100 patients with widely varying results. In acne pits of the face, no significant improvement could be noted 6 weeks after injection. For the first few weeks, a near-perfect result was obtained, but none of these transplants in scarred areas of this kind have been of benefit. Injection of 10 to 50 cc in other areas has resulted in some cells (perhaps 10 percent) surviving over 2 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This technique has gained increased acceptance in the surgical treatment of infants and young children with congenital malformations, despite the fact that its effects on subsequent craniofacial growth are unknown. To examine this question, an experimental model using 25 young kittens was developed to compare rigid fixation with conventional wire fixation, with and without osteotomy. Our findings demonstrate a regional restriction of growth in the developing craniofacial skeleton when both wire and plate and screw fixation are utilized in concert with osteotomy. Further, a compensatory growth was observed in individual animals when plate fixation was utilized that was not seen in the wire-treated group. This suggests that there is a dynamic growth interaction between restriction and compensation in this setting.\r"

Postoperative CT study demonstrated that the remaining posterior orbital wall, combined with the persistently increased intraocular muscle volume, blocked retrodisplacement of the globe, despite adequate total volumetric increase. The increased muscle volume varied from 2 to 5 cc.

The complication rate was 8.0 percent, with three cases of minor seroma-hematoma formation at the bone-graft donor site. These were treated with aspiration. There were two recipient-site complications, with one case of complete bone resorption that occurred in a densely fibrotic nose with preexisting septal perforation and a case of overcorrection that was successfully rasped 1 year later. Because of their easy accessibility beneath the scalp, split calvarial grafts to the nose are useful in various types of nasal augmentation, and the technique is offered as a practical alternative to the use of alloplastic materials.\r"

This modified Goldman nasal tip procedure allows the surgeon to reshape the lower lateral nasal cartilage to increase nasal tip projection as an alternative to the use of a shield-type nasal tip graft, and at the same time it narrows the nasal tip with minimal resection of the lateral crus of the lower lateral nasal cartilage.\r"

The experience with this flap is shown in four patients as follows: primary reconstruction of a mandible as a result of ameloblastoma, secondary reconstruction of a mandible with associated old fractures and malalignment of segments, bilateral malar reconstruction in a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome, and severe sequelae of an already treated Romberg case. Small variations could be made to best accommodate the technique used to the defect we were treating.

Augmentation of the posterior mandible is possible by use of a synthetic implant that is tailored individually to each patient's specific needs. Implant plant thickness varies from 4 to 8 mm, with an average thickness of 6 mm. Careful preoperative planning is done based on an aesthetic assessment of the amount of highlighting desired, thickness of the soft tissues, and the use of life-size photographs and cephalometric and Panorex x-rays. A pattern is cut, and the implant is carved to fit the patient. Insertion of the material after careful tailoring to the individual patient's own mandibular size and configuration requires a generous posterior lower buccal sulcus incision. Antibiotic irrigation and systemic antibiotics are essential, and careful closure in two layers completes the procedure. One implant in the series extruded in a patient who had had radiation therapy, and one patient required repositioning of the implant. Otherwise, in 22 patients there were no infections or permanent morbidity. The procedure seems to be a realistic and safe one for both the youthful and aging face, as demonstrated in patients in this series, with ages varying from 16 to 40 years.\r"

This monitoring system has indicated perfusion compromise in free flaps more rapidly than clinical observation alone. Most important, this has resulted in an increase in salvage rate from 50.0 to 82.4 percent. In addition, our overall success rate has increased from 92.6 to 97.8 percent since introducing this monitor clinically. Computerization also has facilitated the collection of data, which has enabled us to establish expected values for postoperative blood flow in several types of donor tissues used for microvascular reconstruction. Finally, this computerized monitoring system has relieved personnel from basing decisions on subjective data.\r"

  ".W": "The immunologic consequences of transplantation of vascularized bone allografts have not been previously characterized. In this study, knee allografts, both vascularized and nonvascularized, were transplanted from Lewis rats to Brown Norway rats across a strong histocompatibility barrier. A total of 66 transplants and 8 control animals were evaluated. The vascularized knee grafts consisted of 1 cm of proximal tibia and distal femur with a minimal muscular cuff isolated on the femoral vessels, and these were transplanted to a heterotopic, subcutaneous position on the abdominal wall of the recipient rat. Nonvascularized allografts (identical but without anastomoses) were transplanted for comparison. The cell-mediated response was measured by lymphocytotoxicity assay, and the humoral response was measured by cytotoxic antibody assay, both employing 51Cr-labeled target cells. The timing and intensity of the immune response differed according to the type of graft. The vascularized bone allografts generated significant cell-mediated and humoral responses as early as 5 days posttransplant. A significant humoral response in nonvascularized bone allografts was not apparent until day 14, while cell-mediated response in these grafts was variable. These findings were correlated with the histologic appearance of the grafted tissue. Cyclosporine, which was administered to one group of vascularized bone allografts, resulted in the suppression of both types of immune responses. The histologic appearance of this group resembled that of isografts transplanted as controls. The clinical application of vascularized bone allografts may offer significant advantages over nonvascularized allografts in the reconstruction of massive bone defects. Complications such as nonunion, fracture, and collapse of articular segments seen in nonvascularized allograft transplantation may be avoided by preservation of the blood supply to the graft. Characterization of the immune response to vascularized bone allografts may subsequently allow the manipulation of the host and/or graft tissue and promote graft incorporation.\r"

Capillary blood flow and AV shunting were measured using radioactive microspheres before flap creation and 1 and 4 hours after surgery. Total blood flow, measured continuously as venous outflow, increased in the first postoperative hour (p less than 0.05). Elevation of the flap caused a slight decrease in skin capillary blood flow (p less than 0.05), whereas muscular capillary blood flow increased (p less than 0.01). AV shunting accounted for 50 percent of the total flap blood flow, whereas it was negligible in the abdominal wall prior to flap elevation. Thus stalk blood flow, skin appearance, and skin temperature may be poor indicators of nutritional capillary perfusion. However, the clinical and nutritional consequences of these findings remain to be established.\r"

The primary melanoma was Clark's level IV and 1.3 mm in thickness. In 1985, a facial paresis slowly developed. There was no gross evidence of recurrent melanoma in the ear or neck, but CT scan showed a mass in the region of the stylo mastoid foramen. A reoperation of the primary site revealed metastatic melanoma in the facial nerve, expanding it to approximately 10 times its normal size. A composite resection was done for the melanoma, and the paralyzed face was immediately rehabilitated by a masseter muscle transfer. The patient received 6000 rads to this area postoperatively and has remained free of disease to date, having returned to his profession as a dentist. A detailed study of all the specimens indicated that this represented a primary metastasis to the facial nerve.\r"

The patient can use both hands for the activities of daily living. So far, he has been employed and has no significant psychological problems. Temporary intraluminal silicone shunts are extremely helpful for reducing ischemic damage to the injured limb. The sufficient skeletal shortening of the upper limb replantation is crucially important. The wounds must be managed by aggressive and repeated debridement. Accurate primary nerve repair is essential, and the early postoperative rehabilitation is also important to achieve a satisfactory functional return. The functional replanted or revascularized upper extremity is superior to an amputation or prosthesis, especially in the cases of bilateral upper extremity amputation or devascularization.\r"

Definitive genital repair should be done at an age where the anatomy is of large enough caliber for eased surgical manipulation, but prior to the age of recall.

Splenomegaly, which is almost always a feature of visceral leishmaniasis in the immunocompetent host, was absent in eight. Antibodies to Leishmania donovani, which are present in approximately 95 per cent of immunocompetent patients with visceral leishmaniasis, were absent in 29 of 45 (66 per cent) of HIV-infected patients tested. Nine HIV-positive patients with visceral leishmaniasis did not exhibit a primary clinical response to therapy with antimonials and of those who did show a response, relapse occurred in 13, at a mean 4.5 months after stopping therapy. Seventeen patients are known to have died often in association with respiratory disease; Leishmania was seen in one bronchial lavage specimen and in lung tissue in one post-mortem performed. In order to improve the prognosis of visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-infected patients diagnosis will have to be made earlier, taking account of the atypical features, and treatment will need to be improved, both initially and perhaps also by the use of long-term maintenance therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The efficiency of various laboratory and radiological investigations in the differentiation of ectopic from pituitary dependent Cushing's syndrome was studied, based on findings in 23 patients with verified Cushing's disease and seven patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome. Clinical features strongly favouring the ectopic type were male sex and history for less than 18 months. Basal biochemical features strongly indicating the ectopic syndrome included plasma K+ less than 3.0 mmol/l and HCO3 greater than 30 mmol/l; serum cortisol at 9 a.m. or midnight of greater than 800 nmol/l; urine free cortisol greater than 1300 nmol/24 hours; plasma ACTH greater than 100 ng/l. In the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, suppression by less than 50 per cent of 9 a.m. serum cortisol, urine free cortisol or 17-oxogenic steroids was usually indicative of an ectopic source of ACTH. A mean suppressed value of greater than 450 nmol/l for the 9 a.m. and midnight cortisol combined occurred in all of those with the ectopic syndrome, but in none of the 23 patients with Cushing's disease. For urine free cortisol, a mean suppressed value of less than 1000 nmol/24 hours was found in all patients with Cushing's disease, but in none of those in the ectopic group. In the metyrapone test, there was an increase of less than or equal to 3-fold in 11-deoxycortisol at 24 hours in patients with ectopic ACTH; the increase was greater than 3-fold in all but one of the patients with Cushing's disease. Failure to respond to either dexamethasone or metyrapone was found in only one of the patients with Cushing's disease (Patient 16); in the ectopic group, all patients except Patient D failed to respond to either test. It is concluded that patients presenting with clinically obvious Cushing's syndrome along with measurable plasma ACTH can be reliably divided by conventional tests into those that are driven from the pituitary and those driven by ectopic ACTH.\r"

Symptoms and clinical signs were analysed using Bayesian techniques to produce pre-test odds for pulmonary embolism in individual patients. While, as a group, those with embolism could be discriminated from those without on this basis, major overlap existed between the groups, invalidating the use of this approach for individual patients. Strict diagnostic criteria for interpretation of lung scans were accurate using pulmonary angiography as the 'gold standard', but at the expense of a significant number of patients (38 per cent) in the indeterminate (non-diagnostic) group. In the 48 patients in whom the test yielded a diagnostic result, there was a sensitivity of 100 per cent (15/15) and a specificity of 97 per cent (32/33). In the series as a whole, the likelihood of lung scanning correctly diagnosing pulmonary embolism was 55 per cent (15/27) and of correctly excluding embolism, 63 per cent (32/51). By the use of strict criteria for interpretation of lung scanning, reliable information can be obtained on the presence or absence of pulmonary embolism in a large proportion of patients suspected of having the condition. Such information is more discriminating than clinical signs and symptoms.\r"

Mean age at onset was 26.3 years and 97 per cent of patients had presented by aged 60 years. Retinal angioma was the first manifestation in 65 patients (43 per cent), followed by cerebellar haemangioblastoma (n = 60, 39 per cent) and renal cell carcinoma (n = 15, 10 per cent). Overall, 89 patients (59 per cent) developed a cerebellar haemangioblastoma, 89 (59 per cent) a retinal angioma, 43 (28 per cent) renal cell carcinoma, 20 (13 per cent) spinal haemangioblastoma and 11 (7 per cent) a phaeochromocytoma. Renal, pancreatic and epididymal cysts were frequent findings but their exact incidence was not accurately assessed. Mean age at diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (44.0 +/- 10.9 years) was significantly older than that for cerebellar haemangioblastoma (29.0 +/- 10.0 years) and retinal angioma (25.4 +/- 12.7 years). The probability of a patient with von Hippel-Lindan disease developing a cerebellar haemangioblastoma, retinal angioma or renal cell carcinoma by age 60 years was 0.84, 0.7 and 0.69, respectively. A comprehensive screening protocol for affected patients and at-risk relatives is presented, based on detailed analysis of age at onset data for each of the major complications. Median actuarial survival was 49 years, with renal cell carcinoma the leading cause of death.\r"

Primary infection was diagnosed in 27 of 86 patients (31 per cent) and recurrent infection in 27 of 79 patients (34 per cent). Receipt of banked blood from unselected donors after transplantation did not increase the incidence of primary infection in the few transfused patients. Kidney donor seropositivity and maintenance prednisolone in addition to cyclosporin were associated with increases in the incidence of primary or recurrent infection, respectively. Cytomegalovirus infection was clinically mild. Presumed bacterial pneumonias occurred in three patients with recurrent cytomegalovirus infection. The absence of severe cytomegalovirus disease probably reflected the minimal use of prednisolone. Matching of seronegative donors with seronegative recipients seemed unjustifiable in cyclosporin-treated renal transplant patients.\r"

  ".U": "91110875\r", 
  ".W": "Seventy-three patients with chronic renal failure who underwent parathyroidectomy between March 1978 and April 1987 were reviewed. Thirty-four patients had undergone sub-total parathyroidectomy, and 39 patients had undergone total parathyroidectomy with parathyroid autograft into the forearm. Eight patients showed persistent hyperparathyroidism requiring a second surgical procedure. In all other patients there was highly statistical improvement in parathyroid hormone, total calcium, ionized calcium, alkaline phosphatase and a significant reduction in calcium x phosphate product. Histological evidence of osteitis fibrosa was present in 21 of 22 patients before surgery. Postoperatively, four showed complete resolution and improvement. Three patients developed histological evidence of osteomalacia during the study period. Only four of the 39 patients who underwent total parathyroidectomy with autograft had true recurrent hyperparathyroidism and only two of the 34 patients who underwent sub-total parathyroidectomy had recurrent disease, indicating that there is little to choose between the two techniques in the control of secondary hyperparathyroidism and its subsequent recurrence. In one patient with recurrence of hyperparathyroidism from a forearm parathyroid graft the histological picture was different from that of normal hyperplastic parathyroid tissue. Although it is probable that abnormal parathyroid tissue had been implanted there was no evidence of invasive growth into the forearm muscle. The most striking feature of long term follow-up was the difference in calcium x phosphate product in patients in whom vascular calcification increased compared to those patients with no change or regression of calcification. Mean calcium phosphate product in those patients with progressive vascular calcification was 4.93 for small and medium size vessels and 5.38 for large vessels compared to 4.10 for small and medium vessels and 4.09 for large vessels. In the former case the serum phosphate was 2.00 and 2.17 as compared to 1.75 or 1.73, suggesting that the aim in patients with end stage renal failure maintained by dialysis should be to control the serum phosphate concentration to 1.8 mmol or less and the calcium x phosphate product to less than 4.2.\r"

Factors associated with treatment resistance were examined in a case-control study in a hospital hypertension clinic. Patients with resistant hypertension had more severe hypertension and more frequently had evidence of end-organ damage on presentation to the clinic. The prevalence of accelerated phase hypertension, renovascular disease and impaired renal function was also higher in these patients. Cigarette smoking, and the combination of cigarette smoking and heavy caffeine use, were greater in patients with resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertension did not appear to be associated with older age, obesity, regular alcohol use, various psychological factors or non-compliance. These findings support an aggressive investigation policy in resistant hypertension, and underline the harmful effects of cigarette smoking to hypertensive subjects.\r"

This review focuses on how these structures can be modified, and explores the functional mechanisms and significance of these changes. Current analyses of genes often focus on relatively short stretches of DNA and consider chromatin conformations that incorporate only a few kilobases of DNA. In interphase nuclei, however, orderly transcription and replication can involve highly folded chromosomal domains containing hundreds of kilobases of DNA. Specific \"junk\" DNA sequences within selected chromosome domains may participate in more complex levels of chromosome folding, and may index different genetic compartments for orderly transcription and replication. Three-dimensional chromosome positions within the nucleus may also contribute to phenotypic expression. Entire chromosomes are maintained as discrete, reasonably compact entities in the nucleus, and heterochromatic coiled domains of several thousand kilobases can acquire unique three-dimensional positions in differentiated cell types. Some aspects of neoplasia may relate to alterations in chromosome structure at several higher levels of organization.\r"

The first is the structure of the PLA2 from the venom of the Chinese cobra (Naja naja atra) in a complex with a phosphonate transition-state analogue. This enzyme is typical of a large, well-studied homologous family of PLA2S. The second is a similar complex with the evolutionarily distant bee-venom PLA2. The third structure is the uninhibited PLA2 from Chinese cobra venom. Despite the different molecular architectures of the cobra and bee-venom PLA2s, the transition-state analogue interacts in a nearly identical way with the catalytic machinery of both enzymes. The disposition of the fatty-acid side chains suggests a common access route of the substrate from its position in the lipid aggregate to its productive interaction with the active site. Comparison of the cobra-venom complex with the uninhibited enzyme indicates that optimal binding and catalysis at the lipid-water interface is due to facilitated substrate diffusion from the interfacial binding surface to the catalytic site rather than an allosteric change in the enzyme's structure. However, a second bound calcium ion changes its position upon the binding of the transition-state analogue, suggesting a mechanism for augmenting the critical electrophile.\r"

To model the stepwise mutation or loss of both p53 alleles during tumorigenesis, a human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, was used that completely lacked endogenous p53. Single copies of exogenous p53 genes were then introduced by infecting cells with recombinant retroviruses containing either point-mutated or wild-type versions of the p53 cDNA sequence. Expression of wild-type p53 suppressed the neoplastic phenotype of Saos-2 cells, whereas expression of mutated p53 conferred a limited growth advantage to cells in the absence of wild-type p53. Wild-type p53 was phenotypically dominant to mutated p53 in a two-allele configuration. These results suggest that, as with the retinoblastoma gene, mutation of both alleles of the p53 gene is essential for its role in oncogenesis.\r"

Virus purified from stool specimens of volunteers experimentally infected with Norwalk virus was used to construct recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) and derive clones representing most of the viral genome. The specificity of the clones was shown by their hybridization with post- (but not pre-) infection stool samples from volunteers infected with Norwalk virus and with purified Norwalk virus. A correlation was observed between the appearance of hybridization signals in stool samples and clinical symptoms of acute gastroenteritis in volunteers. Hybridization assays between overlapping clones, restriction enzyme analyses, and partial nucleotide sequence information of the clones indicated that Norwalk virus contains a single-stranded RNA genome of positive sense, with a polyadenylated tail at the 3' end and a size of at least 7.5 kilobases. A consensus amino acid sequence motif typical of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases was identified in one of the Norwalk virus clones. The availability of Norwalk-specific cDNA and the new sequence information of the viral genome should permit the development of sensitive diagnostic assays and studies of the molecular biology of the virus.\r"

Spontaneous neurologic disease with spongiform degeneration and gliosis similar to that in mouse scrapie developed at a mean age of 166 days in 35 mice expressing mouse prion protein with the leucine substitution. Thus, many of the clinical and pathological features of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome are reproduced in transgenic mice containing a prion protein with a single amino acid substitution, illustrating that a neurodegenerative process similar to a human disease can be genetically modeled in animals.\r"

Characterization of these sera revealed that the cross-neutralizing antibodies bound the amino acid sequence GlyProGlyArgAlaPhe (GPGRAF) that is present in both isolates. This sequence is frequently found in the PNDs analyzed in randomly selected HIV-1 isolates. Sera from two rabbits immunized with a peptide containing only the GPGRAF residues neutralized divergent isolates, including IIIB and MN.\r"

HIV-1-infected human monocytoid cells, but not infected human lymphoid cells, released toxic agents that destroy chick and rat neurons in culture.

However, the reduced binding phenotype did not have a major impact on viral replication, as judged by plaque size and one-step growth curves. These results suggest that the use of soluble receptors as antiviral agents could lead to the selection of neutralization-resistant mutants that are able to bind cell surface receptors, replicate, and cause disease.\r"

The overall tertiary structure of the RNA molecule forms cooperatively with the uptake of at least three magnesium ions. Local folding transitions display different metal ion dependencies, suggesting that the RNA tertiary structure assembles through a specific folding intermediate before the catalytic core is formed. Enzymatic activity, assayed with an RNA substrate that is complementary to the catalytic RNA active site, coincides with the cooperative structural transition. The higher order RNA foldings produced by Mg(II), Ca(II), and Sr(II) are similar; however, only the Mg(II)-stabilized RNA is catalytically active. Thus, these results directly demonstrate that divalent metal ions participate in general folding of the ribozyme tertiary structure, and further indicate a more specific involvement of Mg(II) in catalysis.\r"

Purified yeast TFIID (yIID) or bacterial extracts that contained recombinant yIID were equally competent to direct specific transcription of the U6 gene by RNA polymerase C.

The model is in general agreement with results of crystallographic and magnetic resonance studies, but differs in important details. It is likely that genetic studies of protein-DNA interaction will continue to complement conventional structural approaches.\r"

This treatment reduced disease severity and speeded recovery, apparently by boosting anti-V beta 8 T cells and antibodies raised naturally in response to encephalitogenic V beta 8+ T cells. These results demonstrate that synthetic TCR peptides can be used therapeutically, and implicate the TCR-V beta 8-39-59 sequence as a natural idiotope involved in EAE recovery. Similarly, human TCR peptides may be effective in enhancing natural regulation of autoreactive T cells that share common V genes.\r"

However, the neural mechanisms of these oscillations are largely unknown. Many pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the neocortex showed prolonged, 5- to 12-hertz rhythmic firing patterns at threshold. Rhythmic firing was due to intrinsic membrane properties, sodium conductances were essential for rhythmicity, and calcium-dependent conductances strongly modified rhythmicity. Isolated slices of neocortex generated epochs of 4- to 10-hertz synchronized activity when N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated channels were facilitated. Layer 5 was both necessary and sufficient to produce these synchronized oscillations. Thus, synaptic networks of intrinsically rhythmic neurons in layer 5 may generate or promote certain synchronized oscillations of the neocortex.\r"

From our own clinical experience, as well as that of others, it appears that re-establishment of portal decompression should offer the best chance at long-term survival. Luckily, innovations in angiographic technique have allowed attainment of this goal without the inordinate risk of an operative procedure. However, not all patients' situations will be amenable to such treatment. For some of them, operative decompression of the portal venous system can be carried out in an anatomic area previously untouched. For those patients in whom no decompression is possible, direct endoscopic treatment of the varices will offer an alternative, albeit temporizing, approach.\r"

  ".U": "91111205\r", 
  ".W": "Today, intestinal adhesions represent the most frequent etiology for complete or partial intestinal obstruction. Although partial obstruction can be treated nonoperatively with a considerable likelihood of success, intestinal strangulation cannot uniformly be predicted or prevented. Complete intestinal obstruction is associated with a significant incidence of strangulation if not treated by a vigorous surgical approach. Consequently, complete intestinal obstruction secondary to adhesions is still a surgical disease. Attempts at control of the adhesion process include mechanical methods to prevent subsequent obstruction and chemical methods to prevent the adhesion process itself. The invasive mechanical methods appear dated. A variety of agents have been used either systemically or in the peritoneal cavity to prevent the establishment of intra-abdominal adhesions. Agents that do not contribute to subsequent morbidity or impede the native host defense mechanisms should be utilized. High-molecular-weight dextran and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents show some promise of being both safe and effective. As is frequently the case, the bottom line in preventing and treating intra-abdominal adhesions is appropriate surgical technique. Intestinal adhesions can be related clearly to leaving damaged, devitalized, or ischemic tissue in the peritoneal cavity or to excessive roughness in handling of tissues. Steps such as avoidance of excessive suture material and unnecessary handling of the bowel will do much to prevent subsequent adhesion generation. Likewise, the surgical lysis of intraperitoneal adhesions is frequently fraught with complications such as intra-abdominal abscess or postoperative incisional failure. This is again related to surgical technique and most directly to the use of blunt dissection to divide adhesions. Knife dissection in the lysis of adhesions is recommended. This technique, combined with excellent intraoperative hemostasis, can be associated with a marked diminution in the incidence of postoperative fistulas and abscesses.\r"

Electrolyte abnormalities should be addressed as volume deficits are being restored. Sepsis, the most common cause of death in patients with fistulas, must be controlled, and the skin must be protected. Reoperation and conservative management are not opposing forms of therapy but rather are complementary.\r"

  ".W": "In the management of the patient with intra-abdominal recurrence of colorectal carcinoma, surgery remains the primary mode of therapy when cure or significant palliation is anticipated. Appreciation of the importance of close follow-up after primary resection coupled with improved diagnostic modalities has allowed the surgeon not only to detect earlier recurrence but also to select the patients most likely to benefit from resection of recurrent disease. Improved surgical techniques with resultant decreases in the rates of morbidity and mortality have allowed safe hepatic resection of metastatic disease. In selected patients, this procedure produces 5-year survival rates approaching 50%. Although a clear consensus has not been reached, most studies agree that positive prognostic indicators include absence of extrahepatic disease, a small number of intrahepatic lesions, a low CEA level, and a better Dukes stage of the primary. Likewise, in the patient with recurrent disease locally, surgery provides the only means of cure and also plays a significant role in palliation. Aggressive resection with generous surgical margins in patients with contained disease may yield 5-year survival rates approaching 35%. In patients with unresectable disease and even in those with carcinomatosis, palliation can be obtained by surgical therapy. Judgment is necessary in treating these patients both preoperatively and intraoperatively. Surgical intervention for obstruction, perforation, or other anatomic or physiological compromise is often indicated and can improve the quality of life of the patient with intra-abdominal recurrence.\r"

Prolapse of the colostomy and parastomal hernia occur less frequently. Their repair is slightly more complex than that of the previous group of complications. Colostomy closure ranges from simple suture closure of the loop colostomy, through anastomosis of the divided colostomy, to the sometimes difficult gastrointestinal reconstruction after the Hartmann procedure. Death after closure of colostomy is infrequent, but anastomotic complications occur after all types of closure. Leak and sepsis are by far the most frequent anastomotic complications. Stenosis occurs less often. The same degree of care exercised during colectomy and anastomosis is necessary for optimal results after colostomy closure.\r"

The disease process is produced by, or at least is associated with, the reflux of alkaline secretions into the gastric remnant. Although it occurs after any procedure that ablates the pylorus including pyloroplasty, it would appear to be most common after a Billroth II gastrojejunostomy. How the alkaline secretions cause the gastritis is still controversial. Clearly, the most effective therapy is to reroute the secretions from the biliary tract, pancreas, and duodenum so that they will not reflux into the gastric remnant. This is most effectively accomplished by a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy with the afferent limb measuring at least 18 inches (40 cm). The surgeon and the patient should be aware that the construction of such a gastric outlet channel is associated with delayed gastric emptying. The etiology of this impaired emptying is also controversial. If the patient has symptoms of dumping (either early or late), these symptoms may also be abated using the Roux limb. At least 40% of patients will have gastric outlet obstruction. Supportive therapy is appropriate in the majority of these patients.\r"

Reoperation occasionally is necessary to correct a complication of gastric bypass. Vertical banded gastroplasty is the operation of choice for reoperations, as it provides weight control while eliminating the problems of bypass. Conversion of a horizontal to a vertical pouch is safe but requires careful attention to the technique to avoid injury to the other organs in the area and preservation of blood supply to the stomach. The gastrogastrostomy across the old horizontal staple line in the vertical pouch can be constructed in a way that will minimize the risk of obstruction. Vertical banded gastroplasty is now the only operation in use at UIHC for the treatment of obesity and is used not only as the primary operation but in all reoperations. Bypass of the stomach and duodenum is not necessary for weight control and adds some risk of malabsorption and duodenal and stomal ulcer plus a lifetime of inaccessibility of the excluded areas for diagnostic and therapeutic measures.\r"

Unfortunately, there often is also a poorly understood psychological element involved in the pathogenesis. Of all ulcer operations, proximal gastric vagotomy results in the fewest physiologic abnormalities and the mildest postoperative symptoms. The continued popularity of this operation should effect a marked reduction in the incidence of disabling postgastrectomy syndromes. Fortunately, symptoms severe enough to necessitate remedial operation are uncommon, and conservative medical management is always indicated and usually suffices. When disabling symptoms are refractory, a thorough evaluation of the patient and an accurate classification of the syndrome are essential to guarantee a satisfactory result from surgical intervention. Although numerous surgical procedures have been developed to deal with the different syndromes, with varied results, the Roux-en-Y procedure has emerged as the operation of choice for most, if not all, postgastrectomy syndromes. However, the Roux-en-Y procedure has not been universally successful, and this operation can itself lead to the recently recognized postgastrectomy state of Roux-en-Y stasis syndrome. Prevention therefore remains the best form of therapy, and remedial operation should not be undertaken until adequate time has elapsed since the original operation and all forms of conservative treatment have failed.\r"

Nevertheless, in most cases, we believe that the second operation should be the final operation and should consist of the procedure with the lowest recurrence rates. Therefore, we believe that the assurance of an adequate antrectomy and complete vagal section is the preferred procedure for most patients with recurrent peptic ulcer.\r"

U.S. Surgical Corporation has introduced a stapling device suitable for use in cesarean sections. The copolymer staples (a blend of polylactic and polyglycolic acids) maintain their tensile strength until healing occurs and absorb without producing granulation tissue. The benefits include minimal trauma to tissue and reduced operating time, blood loss and postoperative morbidity. From July 1988 to February 1989, all patients undergoing low transverse cervical cesarean sections were randomized to either group 1 with the uterine incision performed in a routine manner or group 2 with the uterine incision cut and stapled using the Stapler. The preoperative management, intraoperative technique and postoperative surveillance were similar for both groups. The uterine incision was assessed by pelvic sonography during the postpartum period. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test and chi-square analysis. Both groups were comparable for age, race, parity, gestational age and primary diagnosis. The length of the operative procedure was significantly shorter (p less than 0.05) in the stapled group. These patients also had a statistically significantly decreased incidence of uterine incisions and lacerations. All other parameters were not significantly different in the two groups. The stapled uterine incisions were visible by ultrasonography in more patients in the stapled group throughout the postpartum period than in the sutured group. Thus, stapling of the uterine incision was an acceptable alternative to traditional suturing techniques and it was possible to visualize clearly these incisions during the postpartum period.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic and biochemical data were collected prospectively from 1,530 patients admitted with nonvariceal bleeding of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract between September 1985 and June 1989. Therapeutic endoscopy was done for 93 patients who underwent emergency surgical treatment for bleeding, subsequently required in 29 patients with seven postoperative fatalities. In contrast, 31 (15.7 per cent) of 198 patients (mortality rate of 9.6 per cent at 30 days) died in the hospital who had undergone emergency operation in whom therapeutic endoscopy had not been performed; data for this latter group is now presented. At admission, a greater likelihood of emergency operation was associated with a systolic blood pressure of 100 millimeters of mercury and endoscopic stigmatas of recent hemorrhage (ESRH) (p less than 0.001). Rebleeding rates for the presence of fresh blood, active spurting and oozing hemorrhage or visible vessel in an ulcer base were 26.5, 28.9 and 35.9 per cent, respectively. Endoscopic stigmatas were thus associated with an increased risk of bleeding (p less than 0.0001) and rebleeding led to a sixfold increase in the mortality rate. Congestive cardiac failure, chronic obstructive airway disease, chronic renal failure and a history of previous malignant disease were each associated with postoperative mortality rates of more than 50 per cent. An increased risk of mortality after emergency operation was related to age (p less than 0.0001), preoperative (p less than 0.002) and total (p less than 0.0001) blood transfusion requirement. Immediate operation after resuscitation and endoscopy was required in 87 patients; 11 deaths (hospital mortality rate of 12.7 per cent and 9.2 per cent at 30 days) occurred in this group compared with 20 fatalities (18.0 per cent) documented in 111 patients (9.9 per cent at 30 days) who underwent surgical treatment for rebleeding. We conclude that age, concomitant medical illness and preoperative and total transfusion requirements are each related to outcome after emergency operations. Such urgent intervention is best avoided if at all possible in patients with severe concomitant medical illness.\r"

Under the narrow conditions described herein, stereotaxic fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can identify these lesions with an accuracy of more than 90 per cent and a false-negative rate of 5 per cent. In an effort to reduce this failure rate, the mammographic appearance and stereotaxic FNA results of these lesions each were given scores on a scale of zero (benign) to five (malignant), to derive an over-all risk score prospectively applied to 264 suspicious occult lesions of the breast prior to open, biopsy. While all 264 lesions could be assigned a mammographic score, adequate tissue for assignment of a cytologic score could be obtained from 150 lesions. Of the 150 evaluable lesions, 53 were malignant and 97 were benign, historically. With a total score of two as the threshold for open biopsy, 21 of 150 (14 per cent) were proved to be benign, with no false-negative findings. If the total threshold score mandating an open biopsy was raised to four, the comparable figures were 61 of 150 (40 per cent) benign lesions and two false-negative instances of carcinoma in situ. Provided adequate tissue is aspirated for cytologic examination, we conclude that this algorithm has practical value in the management of nonpalpable lesions of the breast in that it can reliably identify a fraction of the benign lesions and spare these patients an operation.\r"

There was one death; a patient who was comatose upon arrival. The results of this small series suggest that myotomy exposing the mucosa and a flap are two essential elements of the technique; perforations of less than 6 centimeters, even when seen late, may be treated by primary surgical closure.\r"

The prosthesis extends far beyond the borders of the myoaponeurotic defect, and is solidly held in place by intra-abdominal pressure and later by fibrous ingrowth. The prosthesis protects against recurrence in two ways. First, it prevents peritoneal eventration by adhering to the visceral sac and rendering it indistensible. Second, the prosthesis unites and consolidates the abdominal wall. Consequently, the procedure uniquely exploits the very force which caused the hernia to prevent a recurrence. A prosthesis of Mersilene is essential for success because it is supple and elastic enough to conform freely to the curvatures of the visceral sac, has the necessary grainy texture to grip the peritoneum and prevent slippage and is reactive enough to induce a rapid fibroblastic response to ensure fixation.\r"

  ".U": "91111227\r", 
  ".W": "Poor quality or inadequate length of venous and mammary conduits, or both, a severely calcified or atherosclerotic aorta, or diffuse coronary atherosclerosis are situations cardiovascular surgeons will be facing with increasing frequency. These conditions are more common to the increasing number of patients requiring reoperation for advancing disease and to the growing number of older patients requiring operation. Decisions will be made preoperatively or intraoperatively about the technique to be used. Extensive use of the internal mammary arterial graft, such as bilateral internal mammary artery bypass, sequential use of the mammary artery and use of a free internal mammary artery graft, are excellent choices. These methods can overcome some of the difficult situations of the severely calcified atherosclerotic aorta or the absence of adequate venous conduits. Coronary arterial bypass using the inverted internal mammary conduit has too low a flow to be considered. Composite conduits will help gain the length needed to solve both the inadequate length problem and the severely diseased aorta. Little clinical experience is reported to date. These methods should only be used when nothing else is available. The innominate to coronary arterial bypass and the left subclavian to coronary arterial bypass can help solve the problem of the severely atherosclerotic aorta. The coronary to coronary arterial bypass has been used to solve both the severely diseased aorta and the short conduit situation. These methods, while ingenious, are supported only by occasional isolated clinical experiences. A large number of researchers have done extensive work on the selective retrograde coronary venous bypass grafting, but the last published article of any clinical importance dates back to 1979 and this suggests that other alternatives may be better. This technique should be used as a last resort. The surgical arteriovenous fistula has been clinically applied during the coronary artery bypass procedure. The nonconduit revascularization technique of coronary artery endarterectomy is needed in the armamentarium of the surgeon. This technique is not ideal but presently has better results than intraoperative transluminal coronary angioplasty and far better results than laser angioplasty. These methods may be useful to solve the diffuse coronary arterial problem, but sequential grafting techniques should be considered first.\r"

  ".U": "91111228\r", 
  ".W": "The APACHE II Score was used to stratify retrospectively severity of illness in 91 patients postoperatively undergoing drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses. The method of initial abscess drainage (percutaneous or operative) was selected by the attending physician. The two groups of patients, those whose initial drainage was performed percutaneously versus operatively were similar with respect to age, sex, abscess location and, most importantly, severity of illness as assessed by the APACHE II score calculated on the day of their abscess drainage. Over-all, the mortality rate was 29 per cent (26 of 91 patients). Only 1.7 per cent of the patients with an APACHE II score of less than 15 died compared with 78 per cent when APACHE II was equal to or more than 15 (p less than 0.0001). Only 8 per cent of patients with APACHE II equal to or more than 15 undergoing percutaneous drainage survived compared with 30 per cent of patients who underwent surgical drainage procedures. While chi-square analysis demonstrated independence between outcome and drainage technique, outcome was dependent upon severity of illness (p less than 0.0005). Paradoxically, despite the attractiveness of a percutaneous technique for abscess drainage in the most ill patients, in this series, a better, although not statistically improved, chance for survival was noted with surgical treatment. We recommend that an objective severity scoring system be used whenever assessing results of treatment of intraabdominal infection and that surgical treatment not be avoided because the patient is considered to be too ill.\r"

Of the 254 patients, 6 per cent had postoperative CHF. Among patients with preoperative cardiac disease (that is, previous myocardial infarction, valvular disease or CHF), 17 per cent had postoperative CHF; in contrast with less than 1 per cent of those without cardiac disease (p less than 0.001). Patients with diabetes were also at high risk (12 versus 2 per cent, p less than 0.005), particularly those with cardiac disease. Patients who had equal to or greater than 40 millimeters of mercury increases or decreases intraoperatively in mean arterial pressure in relation to preoperative baseline had increased postoperative failure rates (p less than 0.02). Of note, postoperative failure rates were highest among patients with less than 500 milliliters per hour of net intake (input and output) (p less than 0.03). Risk for postoperative CHF was restricted to patients with preoperative symptomatic cardiac disease and was especially high if patients also had diabetes. Intraoperative fluctuations in mean arterial pressure increased the probability of postoperative failure, while the intraoperative administration of higher net volumes of fluid was associated with decreased risk.\r"

In the eyelid, they occur singly in the epidermis and external root sheaths of hairs and eyelashes, and in specialized touch spots alternating with eyelashes. Their typical electron microscopical and antigenic features include dense-core granules, intranuclear rodlets, spinous processes, and a positive reaction for specific cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and synaptophysin. Merkel cell carcinoma probably develops from precursor cells which give rise to keratinocytes and Merkel cells, and nearly one out of ten Merkel cell carcinomas occur in the eyelid and periocular region. They tend to be bulging lesions near the lid margin of elderly patients, reddish in color, and erythematous with telangiectatic vessels. The diagnosis is based on the frequent presence of neurofilaments and paranuclear aggregates of intermediate filaments in addition to features typical of normal Merkel cells. The tumor often mimics lymphoma or undifferentiated carcinoma and frequently invades lymphatic vessels. One third of Merkel cell carcinomas recur, almost two thirds give rise to regional node metastases, and up to one half metastasize widely and result in death. Initial treatment should be prompt and aggressive, with wide resection and routine postoperative irradiation. Although metastatic lesions often respond to radiation therapy and cytostatic drugs, these treatments are mainly of palliative value.\r"

The Physician's Desk Reference and the United States Pharmacopeia Drug Information directory contain numerous warnings of potential interactions between topical glaucoma medications and systemically administered drugs. Unfortunately, literature supporting such interactions is limited, both in quantity and quality, being anecdotal in many cases. This report summarizes available information regarding the nonocular interactions between topical ophthalmic glaucoma medications and other systemically administered medications. Clinical evidence of these interactions is lacking in many cases.\r"
