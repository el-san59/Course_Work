The teenagers completed the inventory in terms of their own reactions; the mothers and fathers were instructed to complete the inventory as they anticipated their teenager would answer it. Mothers held significantly different views of their teenagers' self-concept and grief than did the fathers or the teenagers. Fathers' responses resembled those of their teenagers. In addition to accenting the need to study more fully the family dynamics involved when a child dies, the results call into serious question commonly held views regarding the accuracy and reliability of mothers' perceptions of bereaved children. The results suggest that more credence be given to fathers' observations about the phenomena of bereavement engaging their teenage children.\r"

Functional status was found to improve steadily from 3 weeks to 3 months postpartum, but no statistically significant changes were found between 3 and 6 months. However, by 6 months postpartum 6% of the women had not yet fully assumed the desired or required level of infant care responsibilities, nearly 20% had not yet fully resumed usual levels of household activities, 30% had not fully resumed usual levels of social and community activities, and more than 80% had not yet fully resumed usual self-care activities. Of the 57 women who had returned to work or school by 6 months postpartum, over 60% had not fully resumed their usual level of occupational activities. Canonical analysis revealed that different sets of health, psychosocial, family, and demographic variables were associated with functional status at each data collection point.\r"

The proposed theoretical model had low predictive power among the four groups (20% to 24%); however, the exploratory, empirical models had moderate to strong explanatory power (33% to 58%). Depression had direct effects on family functioning among all four groups in the theoretical model, but the respecified models had direct effects only among the two groups of women. Antepartal stress in the form of negative life events stress had indirect effects on women's family functioning, as was hypothesized, but not for men. High-risk men's partners' pregnancy risk had direct effects on family functioning at 8 months, indicating long-term effects on the family of a high-risk pregnancy.\r"

Subjects were 39 VLBW children (mean birth weight = 1,208 grams) and their primary caretakers, the majority of whom were their biological mothers. Data on caretaker stress and life strain, the caregiving environment, and child behavior were gathered when the children were 60 months of age. The impact of caretaker daily stress and life strain on VLBW child adjustment was moderate and similar to that of normal birth weight (NBW) children. The impact of caretaker stress appeared to be affected by the quality of the caregiving environment. Analysis showed that more behavior problems were found in VLBW 5-year-olds than expected in the general preschool population. Caretakers of VLBW 5-year-olds experienced more intense daily stress than those of NBW children.\r"

The families were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a group in which bottle feedings would be avoided in Weeks 2-6 postpartum and a group in which approximately one bottle per day would be given during the same period. Breast-feeding events most commonly experienced as problems in previous studies were also reported by mothers in this sample. Multiple regression analyses revealed that bottle use in the hospital, lower satisfaction with first breast-feeding, and group assignment were weakly predictive of the Breast-feeding Problem Score at 1 week, R2 = .154, p = .0004. The negative effect of hospital bottle use was greater for women in the bottle-restricted group than for women in the planned-bottle group.\r"

Direct and indirect measures of attitude and social norm were used to predict intention to perform BSE and BSE frequency. Contrary to the model assumptions, indirect measures accounted for more variance in both intention and behavior, and explained actual behavior better than intention to perform. Both the indirect and direct measures of attitude and social norm explained a significant amount of the variance in intention and BSE frequency. There were significant differences on all the model components (direct and indirect measures of attitude, social norm, and intention) between frequent and infrequent BSE performance groups. Discriminant analysis using the indirect measures of attitude and social norm correctly classified 76% of the women into frequent and infrequent performance groups.\r"

Health professionals such as nurses are working toward these goals, but government and community support is also needed. If 24 per cent of trauma deaths can be prevented when appropriate medical and nursing care is provided within the first hour after injury, then health professionals and hospitals, as well as communities, are obligated to provide a system that makes \"appropriate\" care available. Appropriate care involves a team approach including prehospital personnel, nurses, physicians, and ancillary services, all trained in performing primary and secondary assessments. Appropriate care also includes immediate treatment of life-threatening injuries and shock during the first hour. Nurses are key members in this team approach. By utilizing assessment skills, nursing diagnosis, interventions, and constant evaluation, the trauma nurse will contribute to the decrease in preventable deaths during the first hour.\r"

Blunt trauma and head injuries constitute the majority of injuries in pediatric multitrauma. Blunt trauma leaves minimal evidence of the underlying injury and is difficult to assess in the unconscious child. The initial assessment in children is in some ways more complex than in an adult. The airway is a more critical concern in the child. Airway obstruction is a more frequent cause of ventilatory insufficiency in pediatric trauma. Hypothermia is a vital concern because children lack the ability to maintain their temperature when they are compromised. Assessment of circulation and shock in children is complicated because the signs of shock are subtle in the child. The plan of care and the approach to the child must incorporate the child's fears and coping mechanisms based on the child's age and developmental level. Nursing diagnoses should reflect the plan of care not only for the child, but for his or her family. The proper approach to the child can positively influence the quality of the assessment, the level of cooperation, and the long-term outcome of care.\r"

The nurse must have knowledge of the mechanics of injury, the classification of the resulting fracture types, and the usual medical interventions. In addition, emergency department nurses should follow plans of care that are based on nursing diagnoses so that appropriate nursing interventions can be determined and consistently provided. Initiation of these care plans must not be delayed until the patient is admitted to an inpatient nursing unit, but should be begun in the emergency unit setting. This article presents information that the emergency room nurse needs in order to make plans for nursing care, and discusses seven nursing diagnoses that are almost always appropriate for patients seen in the emergency department who are experiencing orthopedic fractures resulting from motor vehicle accidents.\r"

At menopause, women with no contraindications should be given the option of taking estrogen to prevent osteoporosis. Vitamin D supplementation up to the recommended dietary allowance should be used in patients who may not get adequate dietary intake or sunlight exposure. Calcium carbonate should be the main calcium supplement when possible, because it is usually the least expensive and has the highest percentage of calcium. In older patients, who may have achlorhydria, calcium carbonate should be taken with food or another form of calcium that is well absorbed should be used. In compliant patients, calcium supplements should be given in two or three divided doses. Until more is known about exercise and osteoporosis, low-intensity exercise that promotes cardiovascular fitness should be prescribed. One appropriate regimen is brisk walking for 1 hour three times a week.\r"

  ".W": "A fusion protein has been expressed from the relevant genes in mammalian cells consisting of the photoprotein aequorin and an anti-4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenacetyl antibody gene. This chimeric antibody has allowed the development of a sensitive luminescent immunoassay. Initially the cDNA of the photoprotein aequorin from Aequorea victoria was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene was expressed as apoaequorin and, by using luciferin isolated from Renilla reniformis, its activity was found essentially identical to native aequorin. The aequorin gene was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector to produce a fusion protein directing secretion of apoaequorin; the aequorin gene was fused to the 3' terminus of an immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene that directed expression of an anti-4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenacetyl antibody. The gene fusion contained the variable region, the constant region domain 1, and part of domain 2 for the IgG2b mouse immunoglobulin, followed by the aequorin gene. Transfection of the chimeric gene into a cell line expressing the complementary lambda 1 light chain, J558L, allowed recovery of a chimeric antibody with binding specificity for the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenacetyl group and the related 4-hydroxy-3-iodo-5-nitrophenacetyl hapten. The Ca2(+)-dependent bioluminescent activity of aequorin was also recovered.\r"

Recently, HCV cDNA was cloned and the nucleotide sequence of approximately three-quarters of the virus genome was determined. A region of the predicted polyprotein sequence was found to share similarity with a nonstructural protein encoded by dengue virus, a member of the flavivirus family. We report here that HCV shares an even greater degree of protein sequence similarity with members of the pestivirus group (i.e., bovine viral diarrhea virus and hog cholera virus), which are thought to be distantly related to the flaviviruses. In addition, we find that HCV shares significant protein sequence similarity with the polyproteins encoded by members of the picornavirus-like and alphavirus-like plant virus supergroups. These data suggest that HCV may be evolutionarily related to both plant and animal viruses.\r"

The two remaining (nonexclusive) explanations are more stringent biological selection against variants of these proteins or lower mutation rates at the loci encoding the proteins visualized with two-dimensional electrophoresis. While the former possibility cannot be rigorously excluded, the evidence suggests the latter hypothesis merits serious consideration. Some consequences of this latter suggestion for genetic monitoring and the interpretation of molecular evolution are mentioned.\r"

Injection of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunit mRNAs produced a single class of approximately 12-pS AcChoR channels, which resembled the smallest conductance channels present in alpha beta gamma omega-injected oocytes.

A fibrinogen-like sequence was identified in cDNA prepared from the soft tissues of a sea cucumber, parastichopus parvimensis. The PCR-prepared material was then used to clone two closely related mRNA sequences from a sea cucumber soft tissue cDNA library. The putative fibrinogen-related proteins, FReP-A and FReP-B, correspond to the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of vertebrate fibrinogen beta and gamma chains. Computer comparisons of various fibrinogen-related sequences indicate that the sea cucumber proteins diverged before the beta-gamma gene duplication.\r"

Such an organization has been considered to facilitate gene deletion and addition events by unequal crossover between the tandem repeats. We have identified a steroid 21-hydroxylase [steroid, hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (21-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.99.10] deficiency patient who has a maternally inherited disease haplotype that carries a de novo deletion of a ca. 30-kilobase repeat unit including the CYP21B gene and associated C4B gene. This disease haplotype appears to have been generated as a result of meiotic unequal crossover between maternal homologous chromosomes. One of the maternal haplotypes is the frequently occurring HLA-DR3, B8, A1 haplotype that normally carries a deletion of a ca. 30-kilobase unit including the CYP21A gene and C4A gene. Haplotypes of this type may possibly act as premutations, increasing the susceptibility of developing a 21-hydroxylase deficiency mutation by facilitating unequal chromosome pairing.\r"

In skeletal muscle and heart, the Ca2+ release channels (ryanodine receptor) of sarcoplasmic reticulum, involved in excitation-contraction coupling, have recently been isolated and characterized. In smooth muscle, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is believed to mobilize Ca2+ from internal stores and thereby modulate contraction. We describe the isolation of an IP3 receptor from smooth muscle. Bovine aorta smooth muscle microsomes were solubilized with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, and the IP3 receptor was purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation and column chromatography with heparin-agarose and wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. The purified receptor bound 2.7 +/- 0.18 nmol of IP3 per mg of protein with a Kd of 2.4 +/- 0.24 nM. That is, the purified receptor has been enriched about 1000-fold compared with the original microsomes, whereas the Kd for IP3 remains unchanged. The receptor is an oligomer of a single polypeptide with a Mr of 224,000 as determined by SDS/PAGE. Negative-staining electron microscopy reveals that the receptor is a large pinwheel-like structure having surface dimensions of approximately 250 X 250 A with fourfold symmetry. The IP3 receptor from smooth muscle is similar to the ryanodine receptor with regard to its large size and fourfold symmetry, albeit distinct with regard to appearance, protomer size, and ligand binding.\r"

We observe a potent, selective allosteric regulation by ATP of IP3 actions on Ca2+ flux. The action of ATP is selective for adenine nucleotides with ADP and AMP less potent and GTP inactive. At 1-10 microM, ATP increases maximal IP3-induced flux by 50% with no change in IP3 potency. The enhancing effect of ATP diminishes between 0.1 and 1 mM. Concentration-response curves are steep for both the increasing and the decreasing effects of ATP on IP3 actions, suggesting a physiological regulatory role of ATP in IP3-induced Ca2+ release. Diminishing local ATP concentrations coincident with filling of Ca2+ stores by the Ca2(+)-ATPase may enhance IP3 release of Ca2+, an effect that would decline as ATP returns to physiological levels. ATP regulation of Ca2+ release may also play a role in oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration.\r"

Like several cell surface adhesion molecules that belong to this superfamily, C-protein contains sequence motifs that resemble immunoglobulin domains and fibronectin type III repeats.

Calcium ion flux was monitored in individual cells by flow cytometry using the indicator indo-1 AM. Five groups of neuropeptides produced calcium flux changes in lung cancer cell lines and CHO-K1 cells but not in breast cancer cells. The peak increase in free calcium was reached within 10 sec of peptide administration and declined to resting levels in 70-120 sec. When two or more members of the same group were administered simultaneously, calcium flux changes were identical to that produced by each single peptide. When two or more members of different groups were administered simultaneously, an increased calcium release occurred. When identical peptides or peptides from the same group were administered sequentially after the return of calcium concentrations to resting values, no calcium flux resulted from the second peptide. When peptides from different active groups were administered sequentially, a new calcium flux occurred after each peptide. These data are interpreted to mean that members of each active group of peptides trigger a different calcium flux pathway. Thus, many such pathways and different metabolic states exist within the cell. Elucidation of calcium flux pathways in normal and cancer cells may lead to greater understanding of the nature of the malignant defect.\r"

One codes for the classical class I restriction element RT1.Aa, which maps to the locus in the rat major histocompatibility complex homologous to H-2K in the mouse. The other probably codes for a soluble nonclassical class I molecule present in DA rat serum; a short deletion in the fifth exon implies that the translated product will terminate in the membrane-spanning region. These sequences have been compared with mouse classical class I sequences as well as with three published rat class I cDNA partial sequences. The results show, first, that \"locus-specific\" substitutions from the H-2K, H-2D, and H-2L data set are scrambled in the RT1.Aa molecule; a majority of these substitutions have H-2D/L-specific features. Second, the data show that the four rat sequences are strikingly similar to one another regardless of locus or haplotype of origin; they share a number of apparently species-specific features that distinguish them all from mouse classical class I sequences, which likewise share distinctive features of their own. The results suggest that segmental sequence exchange plays a major role in determining the evolution of sequence in class I major histocompatibility complex molecules.\r"

  ".W": "High-affinity nuclear binding sites for 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta E2) were recently found in bone cells; however, the mechanism by which estrogen exerts its effect on bone in vivo is still unknown. To study if estrogen acts on bone directly, we used an experimental model in which test substances are infused locally into rat femur trabecular bone. Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150-160 g were ovariectomized (OVX) and 14 days later a polyethylene tube (1 mm in diameter) connected to an Alzet osmotic minipump was implanted into the distal femur 9 mm from the joint. 17 beta E2 (24 microliters/day at 0.01-1 nM), 17 alpha-estradiol (17 alpha E2) (24 microliters/day at 1 nM), or phosphate-buffered saline (NaCl, 8 g/liter; KCl, 0.2 g/liter; KH2PO4, 0.2 g/liter; Na2HPO4.7H2O, 2.16 g/liter) was infused for 8 days. The contralateral limb remained intact. Animals were sacrificed and bones were examined by histomorphometry. Ovariectomy caused a 50% loss in trabecular bone volume (TBV) in the secondary spongiosa (from 20.3% +/- 1.7% to 9.6% +/- 1.1%; mean +/- SEM), a 2-fold increase in osteoclast number (to 4.0 +/- 0.4 per mm), a 3-fold increase in relative resorption surfaces (to 24.8% +/- 2.9%), a 9-fold increase in osteoblast number (to 11.3 +/- 2.1 per mm), and an 8-fold increase in relative osteoid surface (to 9.6% +/- 1.7%). The local infusion of 17 beta E2 for 8 days into OVX rats (i) restored the TBV dose dependently to 75% and 85% of control (non-OVX) levels, at 0.1 nM and 1 nM 17 beta E2, respectively; (ii) decreased osteoclast number and the relative resorption surface to control (non-OVX) levels; and (iii) further increased osteoblast number and the relative osteoid surface dose dependently (by 5-fold at 1 nM 17 beta E2). Phosphate-buffered saline infusion was without effect. Infusion of 17 alpha E2 had no effect on TBV, osteoclast number, or resorption surface but increased slightly the osteoblast number and the osteoid surface. Its potency was 1/100 that of 17 beta E2. The local infusion of 17 beta E2 or 17 alpha E2 had no effect on body or uterine weight. We conclude from these findings that estrogen delivered directly to the bone of OVX rats in vivo at 2.4 and 24 fmol/day acted locally to inhibit bone resorption and stimulate bone formation.\r"

We have combined physical mapping of the human locus with meiotic and physical mapping in the mouse, together with synteny homologies between the two species, to compare the physical relationship between MYOD1 and the genetically ascertained human rhabdomyosarcoma-associated locus. We have determined that the myogenic differentiation gene is tightly linked to the structural gene for the M (muscle) subunit of lactate dehydrogenase in band p15.4 on human chromosome 11 and close to the p and Ldh-1 loci in the homologous region of mouse chromosome 7. Because the rhabdomyosarcoma locus maps to 11p15.5, MYOD1 is very unlikely to be the primary site of alteration in these tumors. Further, these analyses identify two syntenic clusters of muscle-associated genes on the short arm of human chromosome 11, one in the region of rhabdomyosarcoma locus that includes IGF2 and TH and the second the tightly linked MYOD1 and LDHA loci, which have been evolutionarily conserved in homologous regions of both the mouse and the rat genomes.\r"

Similar results were observed for the 5-HT-stimulated release of inositol phosphates. These results suggest a neural but not glial origin of both responses. Pharmacological studies suggested that release of arachidonic acid and inositol phosphates was mediated by a type 2 5-HT (5-HT2) receptor. 5-HT-stimulated release of arachidonic acid was also detected in cortical neurons, which contain high levels of 5-HT2 receptors, but not striatum, spinal cord, or cerebellar granule cells, which have very low levels or are devoid of 5-HT2 receptors. The phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate augmented the 5-HT-stimulated release of arachidonic acid but inhibited the 5-HT-stimulated release of inositol phosphates. 5-HT-stimulated release of arachidonic acid, but not inositol phosphates, was dependent on extracellular calcium. 5-HT stimulated the release of [3H]lysophosphatidylcholine from [3H]choline-labeled cells with no increase in the release of [3H]choline or phospho[3H]choline. These data suggest that 5-HT stimulated the release of arachidonic acid in hippocampal neurons through the activation of phospholipase A2, independent of the activation of phospholipase C.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of central nervous system receptors for dopamine was examined by injection of poly(A)+ RNA (mRNA) from rat striatum into oocytes from Xenopus laevis. Electrophysiological measurements in mRNA-injected oocytes indicated that addition of 100 microM dopamine induced an inward current (40-100 nA) that was consistent with the activation of endogenous Ca2(+)-dependent Cl- channels. This current was also elicited by addition of the selective D1 agonist SKF 38393 but not by the selective D2 agonist quinpirole. Prior addition of the dopaminergic antagonist cis-piflutixol completely abolished dopamine-induced currents but had no effect on currents produced by serotonin. Using 45Ca2+ efflux assays, addition of 100 microM dopamine to injected oocytes stimulated efflux 2- to 3-fold. This increase was mimicked by SKF 38393 and was blocked by the D1-selective antagonist (+)SCH 23390 but not by the D2-selective antagonist domperidone. No increase in 45Ca2+ efflux was seen with 100 microM quinpirole. Size fractionation of striatal mRNA yielded a single peak (2.5-3.0 kilobases) of D1 receptor-mediated 45Ca2+ efflux activity in injected oocytes. In addition, dopamine stimulation of oocytes injected with peak fractions and prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol caused a 3-fold increase in [3H]inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate [( 3H]InsP3) formation. No effect on [3H]InsP3 production or 45Ca2+ efflux was observed, however, in injected oocytes incubated with 1 mM N6,O2'-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. Thus, in addition to D1 receptors that stimulate adenylyl cyclase, rat striatum contains D1 receptors that can couple to InsP3 formation and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+.\r"

In genomic blots of uninfected human cell lines and of primary human tissue, each flanking-sequence probe hybridized to unique bands, but in 15 of the 22 latently infected clones the flanking sequences hybridized not only to the original fragments but also to a total of 36 additional species. AAV probes also hybridized to 22 of these new bands, representing 11 of the 15 positive clones, but never to the fragment characteristic of uninfected cell DNA. From these data we conclude that the AAV genome preferentially integrates into a specific region of the cellular genome. We have determined that the integration site is unique to chromosome 19 by somatic cell hybrid mapping, and this sequence has been isolated from uninfected human DNA.\r"

The time at which bone formation occurred was dependent on the amount of BMP-2A implanted; at high doses bone formation could be observed at 5 days. The cartilage- and bone-inductive activity of the recombinant BMP-2A is histologically indistinguishable from that of bone extracts. Thus, recombinant BMP-2A has therapeutic potential to promote de novo bone formation in humans.\r"

  ".U": "90192780\r",

At one end nogalamycin contains an uncharged nogalose sugar and a methyl ester. At the other end nogalamycin contains a positively charged bicyclo amino sugar. We report the crystal structure of nogalamycin bound to the self-complementary DNA hexamer d(m5CGTsAm5CG). In this complex, the cytosines are methylated at the 5 position and the DNA contains a phosphorothioate linkage at the TpA step. Two nogalamycin molecules bind to the 6-base-pair fragment of double-helical DNA. The drug has threaded between the phosphodiester backbones with three aromatic rings intercalated within the DNA. In the major groove, the bicyclo amino sugar forms two direct hydrogen bonds to span a CG base pair and interacts indirectly with the next base pair of the duplex via a water-mediated hydrogen bond. In the minor groove, a carbonyl oxygen of nogalamycin forms a hydrogen bond directly to N2 of a guanine. The DNA base pairs are severely buckled by up to 26 degrees and are also distorted in directions perpendicular to the Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds. This complex illustrates the deformable nature of DNA.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue factor (TF) is the primary initiator of the coagulation protease cascades. This cell surface glycoprotein is the receptor and essential cofactor for the serine protease factor VIIa. TF is constitutively expressed in some extravascular cell types and is transiently induced in monocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Inducible expression is implicated in cellular immune responses, inflammation, and intravascular coagulation. Transcriptional regulation of the TF promoter was analyzed in COS-7 cells under conditions of (i) high-level expression and (ii) serum induction. The region comprising nucleotides -209 to +121 (relative to the transcription start site) supports high-level transcriptional activity and can be divided into two distinct regions: a region (-111 to +121) that exhibited low promoter activity and a region (-209 to -112) that enhanced transcriptional activity to a high level. The role of further upstream sequences is still to be established, although two consensus binding sites for the transcriptional activator protein AP-1 did enhance low-level promoter activity. In serum-starved COS-7 cells TF expression was transiently increased 20-fold by serum. All transcriptionally active constructs were responsive to serum, indicating the presence of at least one serum response element, whose function was retained in the immediate 5' aspect of the gene, at -111 to +14. Based on this functional map, we propose that the elaborate pattern of TF expression by cells results from a relatively complex promoter.\r"

Immunolocalization of specific proteins is a powerful tool for cell structure studies but current techniques do not develop its full potential. Immunofluorescence provides only low-resolution localization, whereas conventional thin-section electron microscopy images and immunostains only the section surface. Resinless sections of extracted cell structures offer a simple and effective means of immuno-electron microscopy. Without embedding plastic or soluble proteins, the cell cytostructure produces high-contrast, three-dimensional images. Resinless sections of detergent-extracted cells are prepared by embedding in diethylene glycol distearate, sectioning, and removing diethylene glycol distearate before microscopy. In the first method of immunostaining, extracted cells were fixed and stained with antibodies before embedment, sectioning, removal of the embedding resin, and critical point drying. In the postembedment method, the sample was embedded and sectioned, the diethylene glycol distearate was removed, and the sample was rehydrated before antibody staining. With these techniques, specific proteins were localized with high resolution throughout the entire section. Stereoscopic micrographs of resinless sections revealed the precise localization of specific cytoskeleton and nuclear matrix proteins in three dimensions with unprecedented clarity.\r"

  ".W": "An unusual pattern in a nucleic acid or protein sequence or a region of strong similarity shared by two or more sequences may have biological significance. It is therefore desirable to know whether such a pattern can have arisen simply by chance. To identify interesting sequence patterns, appropriate scoring values can be assigned to the individual residues of a single sequence or to sets of residues when several sequences are compared. For single sequences, such scores can reflect biophysical properties such as charge, volume, hydrophobicity, or secondary structure potential; for multiple sequences, they can reflect nucleotide or amino acid similarity measured in a wide variety of ways. Using an appropriate random model, we present a theory that provides precise numerical formulas for assessing the statistical significance of any region with high aggregate score. A second class of results describes the composition of high-scoring segments. In certain contexts, these permit the choice of scoring systems which are \"optimal\" for distinguishing biologically relevant patterns. Examples are given of applications of the theory to a variety of protein sequences, highlighting segments with unusual biological features. These include distinctive charge regions in transcription factors and protooncogene products, pronounced hydrophobic segments in various receptor and transport proteins, and statistically significant subalignments involving the recently characterized cystic fibrosis gene.\r"

Because NK cell cytolytic activity is known to be triggered by perturbation of the type III Fc gamma receptor (CD16), we sought to determine whether this activating molecule is included in the zeta NK molecular complex. Biochemical evidence for a physical association between CD16 and zeta NK was obtained by comparing immunoprecipitates formed using monoclonal antibodies reactive with each of these molecules by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and peptide mapping. In both clonal and polyclonal populations of CD3- NK cells, CD16 and zeta NK specifically associated with one another. Functional evidence for a specific association between CD16 and zeta NK in intact cells was obtained by demonstrating a coordinate down-modulation of both of these molecules induced by either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or monoclonal antibodies reactive with CD16. Our results suggest that Fc gamma receptor type III (CD16) is included in the zeta NK complex and that this complex is likely to play an important role in NK cell activation.\r"

This has allowed definition of both the complete sequence of the inactive 64-kDa proteolytic fragment, which contains the pseudosubstrate autoregulatory sequence, and of the active 61-kDa Ca2+/calmodulin-independent fragment, which lacks the autoregulatory domain. Comparison of the two sequences shows that the autoregulatory domain extends from Asn-780 to Arg-808. The peptide Leu-774 to Ser-787 does not inhibit smMLCK, whereas peptides of similar or shorter length from the pseudosubstrate region (Ser-787 to Val-807) are potent inhibitors. These data define the autoregulatory region as being contained within and probably identical to the pseudosubstrate domain. The catalytic and regulatory regions are flanked by several copies of 100-amino acid segments containing one of two consensus motifs. These motifs are absent from mammalian skeletal muscle MLCK or from Dictyostelium discoideum MLCK but are present in the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-22 gene product and the titin molecule of skeletal muscle myofibrils. These results indicate that the amino acid sequence of smMLCK encodes multiple functional motifs in addition to the catalytic domain.\r"

  ".W": "Secretin is a 27-amino acid gastrointestinal hormone that stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic fluid. The unusually high number of serine, leucine, and arginine residues in secretin has precluded the use of oligonucleotides to screen cDNA libraries to isolate a secretin cDNA. In the present study, a short cDNA encoding porcine secretin was amplified from duodenal mucosal first-strand cDNA template by using 16,384- and 4096-fold degenerate primers in the DNA polymerase chain reaction. From the sequence of the amplified cDNA, an unambiguous oligonucleotide probe was designed to screen a cDNA library. Here we report the sequences of cDNAs encoding the porcine and rat secretin precursors. The predicted amino acid sequences reveal that each precursor consists of a signal peptide, an N-terminal peptide, secretin, and a 72-amino acid C-terminal peptide. Secretin has been highly conserved through evolution. Rat secretin differs from its porcine counterpart by a single glutamine-for-arginine substitution at position 14. In contrast, the amino acid sequences of the C-terminal peptides are only 39% conserved between the two species, suggesting that the C-terminal peptide does not have an essential physiologic function. RNA blot hybridizations reveal that the rat secretin gene is expressed throughout the small intestine. Although secretin immunoreactivity has been localized in the central nervous system by some laboratories, we are unable to detect secretin mRNA in tissues of the central nervous system by Northern blot hybridization.\r"

  ".W": "Somatic cell hybrids between MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and normal immortalized human mammary epithelial cells have been obtained by polyethylene glycol-mediated cell fusion. The hybrid cells are suppressed in their ability to form tumors in nude mice, as well as in traits specific to the tumorigenic MCF-7 parent: growth factor independence, tumor necrosis factor sensitivity, and pS2 gene expression. In addition, they display other characteristics of the \"normal\" parent, including increased expression relative to the MCF-7 cells of the genes for the extracellular matrix component fibronectin, the intermediate filament keratin 5, and the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin. The levels of keratins 8 and 18 also resemble those of the nontumorigenic parent. These results provide evidence for the existence of tumor suppressor gene products in immortal mammary epithelial cells. We propose a characteristic \"suppressed\" tumor cell phenotype, which encompasses altered cytoarchitecture, angiogenesis capabilities, and growth factor requirements.\r"

To extend these findings, the full complements of keratins in normal, immortalized, and tumor cells were compared. It is shown here that normal cells produce keratins K5, K6, K7, K14, and K17, whereas tumor cells produce mainly keratins K8, K18, and K19. In immortalized cells, which are preneoplastic or partially transformed, the levels of K5 mRNA and protein are lower than in normal cells, whereas the amount of K18 is increased. Thus, K5 is an important marker in the tumorigenic process, distinguishing normal from tumor cells, and decreased K5 expression correlates with tumorigenic progression.\r"

  ".W": "Sustained metabolic rates (SusMR) are time-averaged metabolic rates that are measured in free-ranging animals maintaining constant body mass over periods long enough that metabolism is fueled by food intake rather than by transient depletion of energy reserves. Many authors have suggested that SusMR of various wild animal species are only a few times resting (basal or standard) metabolic rates (RMR). We test this conclusion by analyzing all 37 species (humans, 31 other endothermic vertebrates, and 5 ectothermic vertebrates) for which SusMR and RMR had both been measured. For all species, the ratio of SusMR to RMR, which we term sustained metabolic scope, is less than 7; most values fall between 1.5 and 5. Some of these values, such as those for Tour de France cyclists and breeding birds, are surely close to sustainable metabolic ceilings for the species studied. That is, metabolic rates higher than 7 times RMR apparently cannot be sustained indefinitely. These observations pose several questions: whether the proximate physiological causes of metabolic ceilings reside in the digestive tract's ability to process food or in each tissue's metabolic capacity; whether ceiling values are independent of the mode of energy expenditure; whether ceilings are set by single limiting physiological capacities or by coadjusted clusters of capacities (symmorphosis); what the ultimate evolutionary causes of metabolic ceilings are; and how metabolic ceilings may limit animals' reproductive effort, foraging behavior, and geographic distribution.\r"

For this model of somatic gene therapy, we developed a high-titer, amphotropic retroviral vector designated NTG in which the human GCase gene was driven by the mutant polyoma virus enhancer/herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene (tk) promoter (Py+/Htk). NTG normalized GCase activity in transduced Gaucher fibroblasts and efficiently infected human monocytic and erythroleukemic cell lines. RNA blot-hybridization (Northern blot) analysis of these hematopoietic cell lines showed unexpectedly high-level expression from the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (Mo-MLV LTR) and levels of Py+/Htk enhancer/promoter-initiated human GCase RNA that approximated endogenous GCase RNA levels. Furthermore, NTG efficiently infected human hematopoietic progenitor cells. Detection (by means of the polymerase chain reaction) of the provirus in approximately one-third of NTG-infected progenitor colonies that had not been selected in G418-containing medium indicates that relative resistance to G418 underestimated the actual gene transfer efficiency. Northern blot analysis of NTG-infected, progenitor-derived cells showed expression from both the Mo-MLV LTR and the Py+/Htk enhancer/promoter. NTG-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients with Gaucher disease generated progeny in which GCase activity had been normalized.\r"

Canine keratinocytes obtained from skin biopsy samples were cultured in vitro with lethally irradiated NIH 3T3 cells used as a feeder layer. The keratinocyte colonies consisted of squamous epithelium with numerous desmosomes, tonofilaments, and keratohyalin granules. In addition, the cells were strongly reactive with monoclonal antibodies to cytokeratin intermediate filament proteins. For the infection studies, we grew the keratinocytes on a feeder layer of lethally irradiated PA317 retrovirus packaging cells, which produced a helper-free amphotropic retroviral vector containing the neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene. After cocultivation, 34% (range, 10-76%) of the keratinocytes were found to be resistant to the neomycin analogue G418. Infected keratinocytes were then transplanted into the dog of origin; 1% (range, less than 0.1-3%) of the keratinocytes obtained 27-130 days after transplantation from skin biopsy samples gave rise to G418-resistant colonies. We conclude that canine keratinocytes cultured in vitro can be infected efficiently with a neo gene-containing retroviral vector, and they show persistent G418 resistance for at least 130 days after transplantation into the skin donor.\r"

  ".W": "The periodic transcription of flagellar genes in the Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle is controlled, in part, by their organization in a regulatory hierarchy. The flbG (hook operon), flaN, and flagellin gene operons, which are at the lowest levels of the hierarchy and expressed late in the cell cycle, contain Ntr-like promoters. We report that flbD, one of the early genes required in trans for expression of these operons, codes for a 52-kDa protein homologous to the transcriptional activators NtrC (NRI), NifA, DctD, HydG, and XylR. Our results show that in Escherichia coli flbD partially complements glnG (ntrC) mutations and stimulates transcription of the C. crescentus sigma 54 RNA polymerase-dependent flbG gene. Additionally, the sequence predicts that FlbD protein, along with NtrC, DctD, and HydG proteins, is structurally related at the amino-terminal domain to a larger family of response regulators that mediate cellular responses to environmental stimuli. FlbD may be a singular member of this large protein family in that its function is tied to an internal cell-cycle signal. FlbD is also unusual in that its amino-terminal domain contains only one of the three residues conserved in previously described members of this family of response regulators.\r"

Pretreatment of a CD4+ tetanus toxoid-specific T-cell clone with soluble gp120 was found to exert a dose-dependent inhibition of soluble antigen-driven or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody-driven proliferative response, interleukin 2 (IL-2) production, and surface IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) alpha-chain expression, all of which were reversed by the addition of exogenous IL-2. mRNA for the gene encoding IL-2 was suppressed by treatment with gp120, but IL-2R gene transcription was not inhibited. Bypass activation of the T-cell clone with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin was unaffected by gp120 pretreatment. Thus, gp120-CD4 interaction interferes with an essential role of the CD4 molecule in signal transduction through the CD3-antigen receptor (Ti) complex. Such a mechanism of gp120-induced immunosuppression, if operative in vivo, could contribute to the depressed specific immune responses associated with HIV infection.\r"

The purpose of our study was to determine the effect of HVPC on edema formation in frogs. Hind limbs of 20 anesthetized frogs were injured by dropping a 450-g weight onto the plantar aspects of the feet. One hind limb of each frog was randomly selected to receive continuous 120-Hz HVPC at voltages 10% lower than those needed to evoke muscle contraction. Four 30-minute treatments were administered at 1.5-hour intervals beginning 10 minutes after trauma. Limb volumes were measured by water displacement. An analysis of variance for repeated measures and a Newman-Keuls post hoc test were used to determine the significance of treatment effects. The HVPC significantly (p less than .01) reduced edema formation. We hypothesize that HVPC may also be effective in controlling edema formation after impact injuries in humans.

Intertester Kappa values were .69 for the therapists, .61 for the surgeons, and .42 for all examiners. The predictive value of a positive test was 47% for all examiners, whereas the predictive value of a negative test was 70%.

Several quantitative clinical tests, therefore, were constructed. These tests were used to measure functionally relevant aspects of postural control in standing in 24 stroke patients within a mean time interval of two months following a cerebrovascular accident. Subjects were tested in two stance positions (step and parallel) for five tasks that assessed their ability to withstand perturbations produced by self-generated body movements during functional activities. Intrasession reliability coefficients were very high (r = .94-.99). Intersession reliability coefficients were also high (r = .85-.94). Because the test battery requires minimal training and equipment, it can be easily applied in the clinical setting. The high reliability obtained justifies further evaluation of these tests, which appear to be very promising for use in stroke rehabilitation.\r"

Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine test-retest reliability for measurements of each of the muscle groups at both angular velocities. The ICCs were higher for hip flexion and extension than they were for hip abduction and adduction. The highest ICC (ICC = .84) was found for hip extension at 90 degrees/sec. The ICCs for hip abduction and adduction at both angular velocities were less than .60.

Following surgical repair, fetal wounds heal without scarring. This study was initiated to characterize fetal wounds both histologically and biochemically. Gore-Tex tubing was implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of the back of fetal, newborn, and adult New Zealand white rabbits. Light microscopic examination of healed wounds revealed no evidence of scar formation. Electron microscopy demonstrated a striated fibrillar structure suggestive of collagen within the lumen of the Gore-Tex tubing implants. Amino acid analysis (sensitivity 40 pmol) confirmed the presence of hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline within the Gore-Tex wound chambers indicating the presence of collagen in fetal wounds. The small amount of collagen precluded the typing of the collagen using cyanogen bromide peptide analysis. The absence of scarring and the small amounts of detectable collagen suggest a high degree of reorganization of the connective tissues involved in repair. The fetal wound matrix is rich in hyaluronic acid. Topical hyaluronic acid has been associated experimentally with a reduced amount of scarring in postnatal wound healing. Hyaluronic acid extracted from human skin and scar tissue is associated with collagen and other proteins. We propose that a hyaluronic acid-collagen-protein complex may play a role in fetal wound healing.\r"

The means and standard deviations have been obtained, and the significant differences in many items between males and females have been proved. Some items influencing outer nasal shape have been analyzed. The correlations between nose height, nose length, and morphologic facial height and physiognomic facial height have been discussed. The ratio and amount of nasal breadth to facial breadth and nasal breadth to interocular breadth have been compared and analyzed, and the differences among the different races and between the sexes have been explained.\r"

Nerve exit from the parotid edge also was deep, averaging 9.1 +/- 2.8 mm for temporal, 9.2 +/- 2.2 mm for zygomatic, 9.6 +/- 2.0 mm for buccal, and 10.6 +/- 2.7 mm for mandibular branches. Distal to the parotid gland, danger areas where nerve branches became superficial were distal temporal, lower buccal, and upper mandibular branches over the masseter muscle and marginal mandibular as it crossed the facial artery. Some protection in these danger areas was provided by fascia, especially superficial temporal and masseteric, while platysma provided some protection for the mandibular branch. Fascial and muscle protection was less in thin cadavers. Face lift dissection can be rapid in areas where facial nerve branches are deep or absent, such as postauricular, inferior to the zygomatic prominence, and near the earlobe.\r"

The following results were obtained: Significant age-related changes were observed in the skin blood flow of the deltoid region, anterior chest, dorsum of the hand, and dorsum of the foot. Normal skin blood flow was demonstrated to be highly dependent on age and to significantly decrease with age. Average skin blood flow at these four regions of those 70 years of age decreased by 30 to 40 percent when compared to that of those 20 years of age. The skin blood flow at the deltoid region of healthy subjects was higher by 6.3 ml/100 gm per minute than that of patients in poor condition with cancer of the head and neck.\r"

  ".U": "90192957\r", 
  ".W": "Over the last 14 years, 134 patients with obstructive lymphedema have been treated with microlymphaticovenous anastomoses. Ninety patients were available for long-term follow-up study. Of these, 52 patients were treated by microlymphatic surgery only and 38 of them also had segmental or radical reduction surgery, either at the same time or secondarily. Objective assessment was undertaken by volume and circumferential measurements. Initially, lymphangiography was used, but a study demonstrated increased edema immediately following the investigation in one-third of the patients and it was abandoned, both preoperatively and postoperatively. In the microlymphaticovenous anastomoses only group (N = 52), subjective improvement occurred in 38 patients (73 percent). Objectively, volume changes showed a significant improvement in 22 patients (42 percent), with an average reduction of 44 percent of the excess volume. In the microlymphaticovenous anastomoses and reduction surgery, usually segmental, group (N = 38), subjective improvement occurred in 30 patients (78 percent) and objective improvement occurred in 23 patients (60 percent), with an average reduction of 44 percent of the excess volume. Of those followed up, 67 patients (74 percent) have been able to discontinue the use of conservative measures, with an average follow-up of 4.0 years and average reduction in excess volume of 26 percent. There was a 58 percent reduction in the incidence of cellulitis following surgery. In those patients who were improved, drainage resulted in increased softness of the limbs. Edema of the hand diminished considerably in most patients, although this was difficult to measure. These long-term results indicate that microlymphaticovenous anastomoses have a valuable place in the treatment of obstructive lymphedema and should be the treatment of choice in these patients. Reduction surgery can be used as an adjunct in some of these patients, especially in the posteromedial aspect of the upper arm. Liposuction has been used in failed cases or in patients in whom no lymphatics could be found. Improved results can be expected with earlier operations because patients referred earlier usually have less lymphatic disruption.\r"

An experimental model that reliably and easily produces chronic lymphedema in an extremity would be useful to study treatments in a controlled and comparative manner and would enhance our understanding of the physiology and treatment of lymphedema. Many models that simulate clinical lymphedema have been described, but they suffer from cumbersome protocols, high laboratory costs, and an inconsistent yield of permanent lymphedema. We describe an experimental model for chronic lymphedema in the lower extremity of the rat that creates a lymphatic block in the groin induced by radiation treatment and one operation--surgical division of the superficial and deep lymphatics. All animals develop stable chronic lymphedema of the lower extremity within days of operation, with swelling that persists for at least 9 months. A mortality rate of 8 percent was associated with this technique. Methods for quantification of limb swelling are described, as is analysis of the lymphatic block by lymphoscintigraphic imaging of lymph channels and nodes. This model has the advantages of simplicity of technique, cost-effective use of rodent subjects, reproducibility of lymphedema, and quantification of results.\r"

Ten rats were sacrificed at 6 weeks and seven at 12 weeks (three died prematurely). The behavior of the cancellous bone graft buried in striated muscle and the osteogenic capacity of a simple vascularized periosteal flap also were observed on the same animals. Results of the study are as follows: In 14 of 17 animals, a vascularized periosteal flap wrapped around a cancellous bone graft resulted in new cortical bone formation with little resorption of the initial cancellous graft. A vascularized musculoperiosteal flap has produced a small amount of new compact bone only in 4 of 17 animals. A cancellous bone graft buried into well-vascularized muscle tissue was resorbed (15 cases) or necrotic (2 cases) at 12 weeks. In conclusion, the association of a vascularized periosteal flap and cancellous bone is a better means to produce compact bone than a vascularized periosteal flap alone or an isolated cancellous bone graft.\r"

Moderate and severe lop ear deformities, on the other hand, are more difficult to correct because there is actual reduction in size of the upper third of the ear in addition to the overhanging auricular cartilage. The purpose of this paper was to present a new technique used to correct the moderate lop ear deformity. In addition to excising the overhanging cartilage, I rotate a cartilage flap from the anthelix upward where the missing superior crus was supposed to be. This flap increases the vertical height of the ear and creates a new superior crus. I applied this technique on three cases of moderate lop ear deformities with good results.\r"

  ".W": "Five chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus developed a fulminant hepatitis-like picture when immunosuppression or cytotoxic treatment, given for unrelated disorders, was withdrawn. Viral replication at the time of the final illness was confirmed in three of the five cases by measurement of serum HBV DNA or the presence of HBc antigen on liver biopsy. A cytoplasmic and nuclear pattern of HBc was seen in histological material during life, but at post-mortem was limited to a nuclear distribution, suggesting greater destruction of hepatocytes containing cytoplasmic HBc. In two of the cases, chronic liver disease was found at post-mortem, there being no previous clinical or laboratory abnormality, but it is unlikely that this was a factor in the development of the superimposed fulminating hepatitis-like illness. Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents must be used with extreme caution in any hepatitis B carrier, as withdrawal can precipitate acute decompensation regardless of whether or not there is underlying chronic liver disease.\r"

Aggressive treatment can reverse acute renal failure in many cases but the prognosis for those who require chronic renal replacement therapy is not clear. We have reviewed the treatment of these patients in the Brighton, Dulwich and Guy's Hospitals renal units. Twenty-three patients were treated for a total of 385 months. Over half presented with end-stage renal failure and required dialysis immediately. Fifteen patients died during the study period and actuarial survival was 45 per cent at one year; six have survived for longer than two years. No prognostic features at presentation were identified but those who responded to chemotherapy survived significantly longer than those who did not. Haemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) appeared to be equally effective treatments. Complications from dialysis were more common than in patients with renal failure from other causes. Infection in those treated by CAPD was a serious problem and may be exacerbated by aggressive chemotherapy. Maintenance dialysis offers some patients with multiple myeloma long-term survival and should be offered to all patients who are considered to warrant continuing treatment for their underlying disease.\r"

One was initially positive for hepatitis B e antigen and three were positive for antibody to HBeAg. They had normal initial serum aminotransferase levels. In all four patients, the hepatic illness appeared to be caused by reactivation of hepatitis B virus replication as evidenced by the appearance of HBV DNA in serum at the onset of hepatitis, seroreversion from anti-HBe to HBeAg positivity, and the absence of other incriminating drugs or viral markers. All died within three weeks after the onset of jaundice. Serum HBV DNA level dropped to undetectable level as the hepatitis progressed. We postulate that potent cytotoxic therapy reactivated HBV replication and permitted widespread infection of hepatocytes. Upon withdrawal of chemotherapy, the immunologic rebound resulted in rapid destruction of infected hepatocytes and massive liver necrosis. Several methods for the prevention of such hepatic reactivation are discussed.\r"

The first of the 28 attacks seen in these occurred between a few weeks and 12 years of the head injury. Pneumococci were identified in 25 episodes in cerebrospinal fluid. Of six patients without a history of head injury, one had 'spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea' and five had pathological changes of the ear. Various organisms were found in the cerebrospinal fluid during the 12 attacks in these five. Four of the 17 patients had primary complement deficiency (C7, C5, C4 and C3b inhibitor); 10 (possibly 11) of 16 attacks in these cases were due to Neisseria meningitidis. Routine radiological investigations including computerized tomography did not always identify the abnormality; radioactive cisternography can help to establish cerebrospinal fluid leak. All 58 episodes of pyogenic meningitis in these 17 patients with different underlying disease responded to conventional treatment with antibiotics without mortality and without undue morbidity. Surgical procedures in intracranial disease had variable success. Correction of complement deficiency is not practical at present. In some patients prophylaxis with antimicrobial drugs is the only method of preventing future attacks.\r"

The disease is characterized by a fever of sudden onset promptly accompanied by pain in the loin or abdomen, nausea and vomiting, myalgias and occasionally with acute myopia and conjunctival injection. Within a week acute renal failure develops, necessitating haemo- or peritoneal dialysis in up to 10 per cent of patients. Transient proteinuria, microscopic haematuria and leukocyturia are observed simultaneously. Thrombocytopenia and mild elevations of hepatic enzymes, LDH and CPK, as well as biological signs of acute inflammatory reaction are observed, lasting for a few days. Spontaneous complete recovery is the rule. This picture is virtually identical with that of nephropathia epidemica, a Hantavirus nephropathy observed in northern Europe. This conclusion is supported by the observation of elevated antibody titres against the Puumala virus, the agent of nephropathia epidemica. This rodent-borne infection is markedly milder than that caused by other Hantaviruses such as the Hantaan or the Seoul virus in Asia. Acute interstitial disease due to Hantavirus should be included in the differential diagnosis of febrile acute renal failure.\r"

In all children with hemiplegia, SPECT demonstrated hypoperfusion in the hemisphere contralateral to the motor deficit. SPECT demonstrated normal findings in patients with mild diplegia; bilateral hypoperfusion in the superior motor cortex in patients with moderate di- or tetraplegia; and bilateral reduction of perfusion in the superior motor, inferior motor, prefrontal, and parietal cortices in patients with severe di- or tetraplegia.

On the basis of the direction of flow in the right internal carotid artery (ICA) proximal and distal to the right posterior communicating artery (PCoA), 85 of the 115 studies were placed in one of three categories: (a) Anterior communicating artery (ACoA) dominance (n = 22), with retrograde flow in the entire right ICA, was most common during ECMO and was never seen more than 1 month after ECMO. (b) PCoA dominance (n = 47), with antegrade right ICA flow distal to the right PCoA but retrograde proximally, was common during all time periods. (c) External carotid artery (ECA) dominance (n = 16), with antegrade flow throughout the right ICA, was noted in 53% of studies more than 1 month after ECMO but in only 9% of earlier studies. Patterns changed from ACoA to PCoA to ECA dominance in 17 infants, but no change in the opposite direction was noted.\r"

When equipment became available, pediatric radiologists were quicker to assume control of MR imaging than US and CT. In most large pediatric centers, imaging with all current modalities and of all organ systems has become the responsibility of pediatric radiologists. These findings are in contrast to those obtained in 1979, when pediatric imaging practices primarily consisted of conventional radiography and fluoroscopy.\r"

This allows for acquisition of 11 strongly T1-weighted sections during a single 23-second breath-holding period. Measurements obtained from volunteers and with phantoms reveal that RASE images have a lower signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio than do conventional multiacquisition spin-echo (SE) images due to reduced data acquisition. However, liver-spleen contrast and spatial resolution are not affected. Moreover, contrast-to-artifact (C/A) measurements are 77% greater with RASE. When normalized for imaging time, all parameters are significantly higher with RASE, with a C/A per unit time that was 338% higher. Randomized, blinded review of RASE and SE sequences from 20 patients was conducted to evaluate qualitative performance. Excellent to good performances for phase-encoding artifact reduction, edge sharpness, and overall image quality were recorded for 89%, 88%, and 86% of RASE examinations, respectively, versus 41%, 59%, and 47% of conventional SE examinations, respectively. All results were statistically significant with P less than .001. RASE is an easily implemented imaging technique that utilizes widely available existing technology. Its major benefits relate to significant reduction in imaging time, elimination of respiratory artifacts, and the potential for performing dynamic contrast material-enhanced screening examinations.\r"

None of the 20 patients with transudatory effusion showed these findings. Of the 30 patients with malignant effusion, eight patients (27%) showed chest wall changes similar to those of the patients with empyema. However, two-thirds of these patients had a recognized superimposed complication (ie, sclerotherapy). Contrast-enhanced CT appears to be sensitive to chest wall changes in patients with empyema. CT study of the parietal pleura may help suggest occult pleural space infections and may influence therapeutic decisions that vary with the stage of empyema.\r"

Twenty-two of the 27 patients had primary gastric carcinoma, four had gastric involvement by metastatic breast cancer, and one had antral gastritis and scarring without evidence of malignancy. Although the involved gastric segment often demonstrated only mild loss of distensibility, the presence of a scirrhous tumor was suggested radiographically by distortion of the normal surface pattern of the stomach with mucosal nodularity, spiculation, ulceration, and/or thickened, irregular folds. Ten patients had localized lesions involving the gastric fundus and/or body rather than the classic form of linitis plastica involving the distal stomach. Furthermore, endoscopy had significant limitations in confirming this diagnosis, as findings from brushings or biopsies were positive for malignancy in only 14 of 20 patients (70%). Radiologists should be aware of the frequent proximal location of these scirrhous tumors and of the problems of endoscopic diagnosis.\r"

Each scan was assessed for ectopic gas, focal bowel wall thickening, perigraft fluid, perigraft soft tissue, pseudoaneurysm formation, disruption of the aneurysmal wrap, and increased soft tissue between the graft and surrounding wrap. Comparison of CT findings with operative results revealed that each observer correctly identified as abnormal 33 of 35 cases of PGI either with or without AEF (sensitivity, 94%) and that results were falsely positive in three cases (specificity, 85%). CT findings ranged from large amounts of perigraft soft tissue and ectopic gas to subtle findings of minimal or no abnormalities; thus, strict criteria must be applied to the interpretation of CT scans after aortic surgery. Although CT is not 100% sensitive or specific, the authors conclude that it will continue to be valuable for diagnosing PGI and AEF.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging manifestations of central nervous system (CNS) infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the authors analyzed the results of imaging of the CNS in 24 patients with HIV encephalitis confirmed at autopsy. Careful pathologic correlation demonstrated that neither CT nor MR imaging enabled detection of microglial nodules with multinucleated giant cells, the hallmark of HIV encephalitis seen in all 24 affected patients. The most common abnormality observed on images of the CNS was atrophy, demonstrated in 18 patients. Demyelination and vacuolation of white matter tracts accompanying severe HIV infection caused hypoattenuation on CT scans and hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR images. These lesions had no mass effect. MR imaging was more sensitive than CT in the detection of lesions caused by HIV or other superimposed infectious agents. Although it is often difficult to attribute any radiologic appearance to a single etiologic agent in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the combination of atrophy and symmetric, periventricular or diffuse white matter disease suggests HIV encephalitis.\r"

The magnetic resonance (MR) images of 12 patients with angiographically proved DAVF were evaluated to characterize the appearance of these lesions and to identify those patients at increased risk for complications. Patients with DAVF demonstrating venous occlusive disease are at higher risk for complications from the arterialized collateral venous system. This venous occlusive disease is demonstrated best at arteriography. The MR imaging appearance of dilated cortical veins without a parenchymal nidus is suggestive of a DAVF with veno-occlusive disease. Eight of the 12 patients in our series demonstrated this finding at angiography. Complications, including infarction and hemorrhage, were identified at MR imaging in eight patients with MR imaging evidence of veno-occlusive disease. At angiography 42% of these complications were not apparent. In one patient with a DAVF draining into an unobstructed right sigmoid sinus, results of MR study were normal. Although patients with DAVF without veno-occlusive disease may have normal findings at MR imaging, DAVF associated with veno-occlusive disease and dilated pial venous drainage can be documented on MR images. This subset of DAVF patients, many of whom were identified only at MR imaging, is at higher risk for complications due to veno-occlusive disease. These patients are believed to require more urgent therapy. MR imaging is useful in the pretherapeutic planning for patients with DAVF.\r"

Using Raman spectroscopy to measure blood oxygenation and taking T2 measurements at 2.1 and 9.4 T, the authors examined the relaxation mechanisms acting during deoxygenation, increases in hematocrit, and fibrin-clot formation and retraction. Individual contributions to overall T2 from deoxyhemoglobin and the interactions of water with protein hydration layers in hemoglobin, plasma proteins, and fibrin were measured. Overall T2 values estimated by summing individual relaxation rates were in reasonable agreement with the T2 values of clotted blood. Results suggest that deoxygenation may be most important in T2 shortening, followed by increased hematocrit. T2 shortening from fibrin polymerization was minimal at the field strengths used. Effects of deoxygenation and increasing hematocrit are more sensitive to field strength than fibrin T2 shortening. Effects of fibrin may be more significant at middle and low field strengths.\r"

On the basis of their morphologic appearance in the freezing microtome sections, most of the lumbar intervertebral disks could be categorized as one of six types. Each type has characteristic features and a distinctive appearance on MR images. Findings of this study--including decreased signal intensity from the intervertebral disk, altered signal intensity in contiguous bone marrow, bulging of the anulus fibrosus, herniation of the nucleus pulposus, and contrast enhancement after intravenous administration of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)--resemble observations from human clinical studies. Classification of degenerating disks and identification of MR imaging characteristics of each type may improve the interpretation of MR images and recognition of early disk degeneration in humans.\r"

After transplantation, T1-weighted MR images of vertebral marrow showed a characteristic band pattern consisting of a peripheral zone of intermediate signal intensity and a central zone of bright signal intensity. Reciprocal changes were identified on short inversion time inversion recovery images. At histologic examination the central zone corresponded to fatty marrow; the peripheral zone corresponded to a zone of regenerating hematopoietic cells. Posttransplantation T1 and T2 relaxation times of the entire vertebral marrow were calculated from the spin-echo images; no statistically significant trends in relaxation times were noted. Knowledge of the normal MR pattern of marrow regeneration after transplantation may be useful in screening for residual marrow disease, determining marrow engraftment, and differentiating marrow repopulation with normal versus malignant cells.\r"

Bone marrow with low or intermediate to slightly increased signal intensity was considered red marrow, while bone marrow with increased signal intensity was considered fatty marrow. An orderly progression of red to yellow marrow conversion in the femur was appreciated first in the diaphysis (ages 1-10 years) and then in the distal metaphysis (ages 10-20 years), with an adult pattern seen by age 24 years. The MR spectrum of red and yellow marrow differs from the existing macroscopic anatomical data because MR imaging is apparently more sensitive to the presence of microscopic fat in bone marrow.\r"

High interobserver variability limited identifiable differences. Review of cases with subtle findings on the digital system at a resolution of 2,048 X 1,680 X 12 bits (2.5 line pairs per millimeter) revealed adequate visualization of the abnormality in every case. It is concluded that a resolution of 1,024 X 840 X 12 bits is adequate for the interpretation of many musculoskeletal abnormalities but that a resolution of 2,048 X 1,680 X 12 bits is needed for visualization of some subtle abnormalities.\r"

Fifteen of these patients were 18 years old and under and manifested rapidly appearing, usually symmetric, sclerotic metaphyseal lesions. The remaining 14 patients were more than 18 years old and had fewer, asymmetric sclerotic lesions. In most patients (28 of 29), a radiographically dominant skeletal tumor was seen. Pulmonary metastases occurred in the majority of patients and were detected at the same time as the bone lesions. These 29 patients were studied with regard to demographic data and skeletal distribution and radiographic appearance of their lesions. As a result of the findings, a metastatic origin from a primary dominant osteosarcoma is favored over a multifocal origin as the basis for osteosarcomatosis. Osteosarcomatosis is more commonly encountered in the mature skeleton than has been previously recognized.\r"

Data could be acquired from gamma cameras at rates exceeding 200,000 counts per second, with spatial resolution exceeding intrinsic camera resolution. Clinical analysis could be rapidly performed. This system performed better than most dedicated nuclear medicine computers with respect to speed of data acquisition and spatial resolution of images while maintaining full compatibility with the standard image display, hard-copy, and networking formats. It could replace such dedicated systems in the near future as software is refined.\r"

In a regression model, measures of the number of engineers employed by a department, the number of attending staff, and the number of training lectures given by engineers were found to be most highly associated with dollar value of grant support. The average level of research resources available at responding institutions was generally low, despite a seemingly strong desire to do quality research.

To enable accurate estimation of the resultant absorbed radiation doses to tissues, an intraoperative beta detection probe is used to scan the liver surface. The validity of the response of this probe to Y-90 and its clinical application were assessed with a phantom containing varying activities and with biopsy samples obtained from patients being treated with SIR therapy. A linear relationship was found between the probe counts taken from the biopsy samples and the calculated tissue radiation doses from the specific activities of each sample. This relationship was repeated with probe counts determined against a water phantom containing various activities of Y-90. The probe was shown to respond minimally to bremsstrahlung. The use of the probe in measuring tissue radiation doses at laparotomy provides the opportunity to control dose administration during SIR therapy. In this way, subtherapeutic exposure of normal tissue can be assured while tumor tissue receives maximal radiation levels.\r"

MR imaging exposure of effector cells was performed in a 2.35-T static magnetic field for 50 minutes. The chromium-51-release assay was used to determine NK cell cytotoxicity.

Nine wrists with a scapholunate space no wider than 2 mm and without chondrocalcinosis were studied by means of plain routine views and special projections, transaxial and coronal computed tomographic scans, and dissection to determine the precise orientation and anatomy of this space. A PA radiograph with 10 degrees of tube angulation from the ulna toward the radius best demonstrated the scapholunate space. This space should be measured at the level of the midportion of the flat lateral facet of the scaphoid.\r"

Data were acquired with a three-dimensional velocity-compensated (fast imaging with steady-state precession) sequence. MR angiograms were obtained with a ray projection algorithm by using maximum intensity values. Portions of the vascular anatomy--particularly venous structures and smaller arteries--were better portrayed on the postcontrast than on the precontrast angiograms. Enhancing lesions were also seen on the projection images. Enhancement of dura and extracranial tissues (sinus and nasal mucosa) can obscure vascular detail.\r"

The final diagnosis was established clinically in four patients and surgically in five. MR imaging enabled the recognition of each entity without error. Retrospective review of findings highlighted other potential discriminating features, the most important of which were testicular size and vascularity. Because of its ability to highlight vessels and detail normal and abnormal intrascrotal anatomy, MR imaging in this small series enabled the differentiation of subacute torsion from epididymitis with 100% accuracy. This high degree of accuracy warrants further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "To discover whether the increase in urinary excretion of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) is mediated by oxygen free radicals generated after injection of contrast medium, the authors tested the hypothesis that inhibition of oxygen free radical production after injection of sodium methylglucamine diatrizoate or iothalamate sodium diminishes urinary THP excretion. In three groups of dogs, kidneys received continuous infusions of either superoxide dismutase (SOD) and normal saline (six dogs), heat-inactivated SOD and normal saline (six dogs), or normal saline alone (four dogs). Urinary THP excretion, glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, mean arterial pressure, and renal venous malondialdehyde concentrations were measured before and after administration of contrast medium to each kidney. During the postcontrast period, SOD significantly attenuated the increase in urinary THP excretion, accompanied by an attenuated increase in renal venous malondialdehyde concentration. Heat-inactivated SOD did not attenuate renal hemodynamics or urinary THP excretion. The use of another contrast medium, iothalamate sodium, similarly increased urinary THP excretion. These results show that intrarenal administration of contrast medium induces a transient increase in urinary THP mediated in part by oxygen free radical damage to the kidney. Thus, THP may be a marker of renal tubular injury after injection of contrast medium.\r"

Seven stenotic lesions in peripheral vessels were identified that had progressed to total occlusion in the interval between the time that diagnostic run-off angiography and attempted angioplasty were performed. The post-angiographic occlusions were 3-16 cm long (mean, 9 cm), and the interval between diagnostic angiography and discovery of the occlusions ranged from 1 hour to 91 days (median, 2 days). Treatment of the occlusions was riskier and more difficult than simple angioplasty of the original stenoses. The authors conclude that some aspect of the angiographic procedure probably precipitated the transition from stenosis to occlusion. This complication can be prevented by preparation for angioplasty immediately after diagnostic run-off angiography or perhaps by use of heparin during the diagnostic study.\r"

Scanning with an indium-111-labeled Fab fragment of a murine monoclonal antifibrin antibody (59D8) and ascending contrast venography were performed in 33 patients. Images of the calves, popliteal fossae, thighs, and pelvis were obtained immediately, 4-6 hours, and 24 hours after injection of 2 mCi (74 MBq) of the antibody. All images were read in a blinded manner. Findings in both studies were positive in 28 patients and negative in three. In 19 patients not undergoing heparin therapy, 19 specific anatomic sites were positive on venograms and 29 were positive on antibody images (19 sites matched). In 14 patients undergoing heparin therapy, 34 sites were positive on venograms and 27 were positive on antibody images (22 sites matched). In most patients, positive results were noted within 1 hour of antibody injection. No adverse effects were noted with the antibody preparation. Preliminary data suggest that antifibrin antibody imaging is sensitive in detecting clots, is safe to use, and may have a role in diagnosing and managing venous thrombosis.\r"

Twelve stents were placed into the infrarenal abdominal aorta and two stents in the left common iliac arteries by the left carotid artery approach. To firmly expand the stent against the vascular wall, nominal stent sizes 0.5-1.0 mm larger than the measured arterial diameter were required. Arteriography performed at specified follow-up intervals showed no evidence of thrombi or emboli; all side branches (lumbar arteries) covered by the stents remained patent. Vascular diameter decreased minimally at 8 and 26 weeks, associated with histopathologic evidence of neointimal buildup. This buildup was highest at 8 weeks (mean, 313 microns) and was slightly less at 26 weeks (mean, 223 microns). Almost complete coverage by endothelium was seen as early as 3 weeks. It is concluded that the flexible tantalum wire stents are well tolerated by the arterial wall and become quickly endothelialized. No excessive neointimal buildup was observed during the 6-month study.\r"

On the basis of the experimental results, in which there was no relevant stenosis, occlusion, or migration of the vascular prosthesis, nine patients were treated: one with iliac artery occlusive disease and eight with superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease (four reocclusions after angioplasty and four unsatisfactory primary angioplasty results). One SFA lesion was treated with the crossover method from the contralateral side. All implants remained patent without hemodynamically significant stenoses, with the longest observation time being 6 months. Flexible, expandable vascular prostheses are promising adjuncts to angioplasty.\r"

The plasma membrane of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was stained with a fluorescent lipid analog dihexadecanoyl indocarbocyanine. A line was photobleached on the cell surface perpendicular to the direction of cell motion. Low-light-level fluorescence microscopy and digital image-processing techniques were used to analyze a series of images taken at short intervals after photobleaching. The bleached line remained visible for about 5 seconds before being erased by diffusional recovery. Examination of fluorescence intensity profiles allowed a comparison to be made between the velocities of line and cell movement. Results indicate that the bleached line moves forward with the same velocity as the cell during locomotion, refuting the retrograde lipid flow model of locomotion. Instead, the plasma membrane lipid appears to move forward according to either the unit movement of membrane or the tank track model of locomotion.\r"

The complementary DNAs encoding PTTH of the silkmoth Bombyx mori were cloned and characterized, and the complete amino acid sequence was deduced. The data indicated that PTTH is first synthesized as a 224-amino acid polypeptide precursor containing three proteolytic cleavage signals. The carboxyl-terminal component (109 amino acids) that follows the last cleavage signal represents one PTTH subunit. Two PTTH subunits are linked together by disulfide bonds, before or after cleavage from prepro-PTTH, to form a homodimeric PTTH. When introduced into Escherichia coli cells, the complementary DNA directed the expression of an active substance that was functionally indistinguishable from natural PTTH. In situ hybridization showed the localization of the prepro-PTTH mRNA to two dorsolateral neurosecretory cells of the Bombyx brain.\r"

The effect of Ca2+ on the proximity of troponin-I to actin in reconstituted rabbit skeletal thin filaments was determined. The distance between the cysteine residue at position 133 (Cys133) of troponin-I and Cys374 of actin increases by approximately 15 angstroms on binding of Ca2+ to troponin-C. Also, troponin-I labeled at Cys133 with benzophenone-4-maleimide could be photo cross-linked to actin in the absence of Ca2+, but not in its presence. These results suggest that troponin-I is attached to actin in the Ca2(+)-free or relaxed state of muscle, and that it detaches from actin on Ca2+ activation of contraction. Thus, troponin-I may function as a Ca2(+)-dependent molecular switch in regulation of skeletal muscle contraction.\r"

Induction of synaptic long-term potentiation by means of repetitive sampling of inputs caused the simulation to organize encodings of learned cues into a hierarchical memory that uncovered statistical relationships in the cue environment, corresponding to the performance of hierarchical clustering by the biological network. Simplification led to characterization of those parts of the network responsible for the mechanism, resulting in a novel, efficient algorithm for hierarchical clustering. The hypothesis is put forward that these corticobulbar networks and circuitry of similar design in other brain regions contain computational elements sufficient to construct perceptual hierarchies for use in recognizing environmental cues.\r"

Further, 91% of the clinic patients and 56% of the private practice patients stated that they had, at some time, used medications from Mexico.

The indications for cesarean section had an effect on febrile morbidity. In patients having nonelective cesarean section, febrile morbidity was high, occurring in 62.7% of the saline control group and 32.9% of those receiving ticarcillin disodium irrigation. In patients having elective cesarean section, febrile morbidity was lower (28% in the saline control group and 8.3% in the ticarcillin group [P less than or equal to .05]). Ticarcillin and cefoxitin were equal in reducing postoperative febrile morbidity. The use of prophylactic antibiotics, therefore, is indicated both in high-risk patients having nonelective cesarean section and in low-risk patients having elective repeat cesarean section.\r"

We randomly assigned 30 patients to one of two groups, each consisting of 15 patients. Group 1 received an epidural redose in the upright position, and the patients in group 2 received a redose in the supine position. There were no differences with respect to the sacral or cephalad spread.

Overall accuracy for assigning cases was 86%. Specific accuracy (histologic type of neoplasms predicted by FNA) was 72%. No inflammatory lesion was incorrectly diagnosed as neoplasm. Eight patients with histologically documented neoplasm had aspirates classified as nonneoplastic because the sample obtained was not representative. These data indicate that FNA is a highly specific method for identifying benign and malignant neoplasms. Applications of salivary gland FNA include (1) identification of nonneoplastic lesions that may respond to nonsurgical management, (2) identification of neoplasms that represent lymph node metastases rather than primary lesions of the salivary gland, (3) preliminary identification of lymphomas, and (4) preliminary separation of benign and malignant neoplasms.\r"

Intracranial pressure was measured through a slender subarachnoid catheter with a transducer. Thirty-nine checkpoints of computed tomography findings, including a shift of midline structure, the status of ventricles or cisterns, and the amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage, were investigated. The results were as follows: (1) The computed tomography findings that contributed to estimating intracranial pressure were the appearance of cisterns, the size of a subdural hematoma (number of slices), ventricular size, status of subarachnoid hemorrhage, status of cerebral contusion, magnitude of midline shift, and ventricular index, in that order. (2) Approximately 80% of predicted cases of intracranial pressure were included within the range of measured intracranial pressure +/- 10 mmHg. When the predicted intracranial pressure was less than 30 mmHg, the discrepancy between both intracranial pressures was small. It is concluded that an equation using several computed tomography findings gives a reasonably accurate intracranial pressure for the initial stage of severe head injury.\r"

The most constant findings were seen in the muscle cells of the media layer. Fragmentation of the nuclei was frequently observed together with cytoplasmic vacuoles. Scattered groups or single degenerated muscle cells were also noted. In the intima the changes included rounding of the nuclei along with the appearance of cytoplasmic vacuoles.

No concurrent infection or systemic vasculitis was present. After initial treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide, the patient did well on chronic steroids alone for 4 years. He then independently stopped taking the steroids and suffered a second hemorrhage. Steroids were reinstated, and he did well for 3 more years before he experienced a third hemorrhage. Intravenous steroids were given acutely and tapered to a chronic maintenance dose. Although granulomatous angiitis of the nervous system usually causes death within weeks to months of the appearance of symptoms, the patient is still alive more than 12 years since the tissue-proven diagnosis. This unusually long survival is attributed to the continued use of steroids, even when the patient is asymptomatic.\r"

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an enhanced tumorous lesion at the inner orifice of the left hypoglossal canal. Skull x-ray was normal, and cerebral angiography showed no vascular abnormalities. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid showed mild pleocytosis with a predominance of lymphocytes. Systemic examination revealed no abnormalities. The tumor was removed completely and pathologic investigation revealed that it was an inflammatory granuloma. The patient's history and laboratory data, however, failed to suggest the underlying disease, and histopathologic examination did not indicate any special type of granuloma. Therefore, the lesion was diagnosed as a nonspecific inflammatory granuloma.\r"

Ciliary beat frequency was measured by a photometric technique, and changes in epithelial and ciliary ultrastructure were assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Ribavirin solution at the recommended concentration of 20 mg/ml had no adverse effects on ciliary activity in vitro; at concentrations of 50 mg/ml and above it slowed ciliary beating significantly and at 60 mg/ml caused ciliostasis associated with epithelial disruption. Nasal inhalation of ribavirin at 60 mg/ml for up to 20 minutes, however, did not slow nasal mucociliary clearance, nor did it adversely affect the ciliary beating or structure of nasal ciliated epithelium examined in vitro immediately after inhalation.\r"

After nebulisation of 3 ml (150 micrograms) beclomethasone dipropionate the amount of drug in particles less than 5 microns was 16 micrograms (GSD 1.1) with the Pari Inhalierboy, and 27 micrograms (1.4) with the Medix Traveller with cirrhus nebuliser. This was less than the amount in particles less than 5 microns after three metered dose inhaler actuations (150 micrograms) from the Nebuhaler (58.2 (1) micrograms) or the Volumatic spacer (46.5 (1) micrograms). The greater amount of beclomethasone dipropionate in small particles with administration from a metered dose inhaler with a spacer device means that considerably more drug is likely to reach the airways than when the same dose is given by the two nebulisers studied.\r"

The patients presented in one of three ways--with neonatal respiratory impairment (12 cases) requiring urgent diagnosis and treatment, with recurrent respiratory tract infections (3), and with pneumothorax (1). Diagnostic problems arose with the neonatal presentation. In four of the children laparotomy was performed for presumed diaphragmatic hernia; three of these children had right sided lesions. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia was excluded by contrast studies in a further two patients. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis in all cases. The postoperative course was uneventful in all 16 patients. No long term impairment of pulmonary function was noted.\r"

The patients also had individual lung volumes assessed radiographically and had radionuclide (krypton-81 m, technetium-99 m macroaggregates) ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) lung scans. Four patients had pectus excavatum and two had mild scoliosis. Spirometric measurements were lower in the patients than in the control subjects but only the differences in peak expiratory flow and flow at 50% of expired vital capacity were significant. The radiographic left lung volumes in patients surviving left diaphragmatic repair were larger than expected at 49.3% (SD 2%), suggesting alveolar overdistension. V/Q scans showed a mismatch in the ipsilateral lung, mean Q (40% (7%] being significantly lower than mean V (47% (6%)). In seven patients who had required ventilation for four days or more perfusion to the ipsilateral lung was significantly lower (34% (6%)) than values for the 12 patients ventilated for less than four days (43% (6%)). Survivors of right diaphragmatic repair had a better outcome in terms of relative radiographic lung volumes and V/Q distribution. More severely affected children are now surviving repair of congenital diaphragmatic herniation, with residual pulmonary abnormalities that could produce functional impairment in adult life.\r"

  ".W": "Hospital management of acute severe asthma in 14 large hospitals in Birmingham and Manchester was audited in a random 20% of 1196 patients aged 15-45 years admitted in 1985. Of the 239 admissions randomised, 192 were suitable for study. Results were compared with those from a study in the same hospitals using the same methods in 1978. The age and sex of the patients and their smoking history, duration of asthma, and hospital attendance were similar in 1978 and 1985. A much smaller proportion of patients presented with symptoms of over seven days' duration in 1985 (8.5%) than in 1978 (26%). The inpatient management of asthma appears to have improved in both thoracic and general units, with more thorough functional assessments, more frequent performance of relevant investigations (arterial blood gases and peak expiratory flow rates) and more frequent use of recommended treatment (nebulised bronchodilators, oral and intravenous corticosteroids). Less difference was found in 1985 between units with a specialist thoracic interest and those without, though some differences remained in 1985 in monitoring of peak expiratory flow rate and arterial blood gases, outpatient prescribing, and follow up arrangements. Inhaled preventive medication was prescribed more frequently than in 1978. In 1985 there was a 56% increase in admissions for asthma. The proportion of severely ill patients was similar to that in 1978, but in the most severe functional grade mean arterial carbon dioxide tension was higher in 1985 and more patients were ventilated. Our results suggest that hospital management by thoracic and general physicians has improved over the period 1978-85. Patients presented earlier in 1985, though there seems to have been an increase in asthma of all grades of severity.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between small airways disease and parenchymal destruction was investigated in lungs and lobes removed at surgery from 27 patients aged 15-70 years. Eight of the 27 patients were life-long non-smokers. The degree of small airways disease was assessed by semi-quantitative grading (SAD score) and by measuring diameter and wall thickness of membranous bronchioles. Parenchymal destruction was measured in three ways. Firstly, the number of alveolar attachments on membranous bronchioles per millimetre of circumference (AA/mm) was counted; the number of broken attachments was subtracted from the total AA/mm to give the numbers of intact attachments (normal AA/mm). Secondly, a point counting technique was used to give a destructive index (DI). Thirdly, the mean linear intercept (Lm) was determined. Total and normal AA/mm correlated negatively with the SAD score of membranous bronchioles (rs = -0.48 and -0.51) and with wall thickness (rs = -0.37 and -0.45) and DI correlated with wall thickness (rs = 0.5) and with the SAD score of respiratory bronchioles (rs = 0.53). Lm did not correlate with indices of small airway disease and total and normal AA/mm did not correlate with diameter. Multiple regression analyses showed that the correlation of total AA/mm with the SAD score of membranous and respiratory bronchioles and with wall thickness were not confounded by age or smoking. It is concluded that small airways disease is related to destruction of peribronchiolar alveoli, and it is postulated that small airways disease has a direct role in the causation of centrilobular emphysema.\r"

  ".W": "Selenium is an essential component of glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme that helps protect cells against oxidation damage and modulates the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. Low selenium concentrations might therefore influence the inflammatory process in asthma by reducing the activity of glutathione peroxidase. Whole blood and plasma selenium concentrations and glutathione peroxidase activity have been measured in 56 asthmatic patients and 59 non-asthmatic control subjects in New Zealand, a country with a low dietary selenium intake and a high prevalence of asthma. When compared with control subjects the asthmatic patients had lower values for whole blood selenium concentrations (-4.9, 95% confidence interval -10.2 to 0.4 ng/ml) and glutathione peroxidase activity (-3.3, 95% CI -5.8 to -0.8 units/g Hb). There was a 1.9 and 5.8 fold increased risk of asthma in subjects with the lowest range of whole blood selenium concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity respectively (95% CI 0.6 to 5.6 and 1.6 to 21.2). Levels were lower in patients and control subjects without an atopic predisposition, but were not affected by prednisone use. Similar differences between the asthmatic and control subjects were not observed for selenium concentration or glutathione peroxidase activity measured in plasma, which reflects short term rather than long term selenium content. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low selenium concentrations may have a role in the pathogenesis of asthma in New Zealand.\r"

An osmotic pulse technique was used to incorporate IHP, a compound that normally does not cross the RBC membrane. Two groups of six volunteers were studied. RBCs were treated under conditions that resulted in a relatively large increase in mean corpuscular volume (delta MCV = 11.8 +/- 4.0, 1 SD) in Group I, but a relatively small increase (delta MCV = 5.5 +/- 1.9) in Group II. The groups had a similar decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin (delta MCH = -3.8 +/- 0.9 for Group I and -3.1 +/- 1.1 for Group II). The 24-hour posttransfusion RBC survival, measured with 3 mL of 51Cr-labeled autologous RBCs, correlated with the induced change in oxygen affinity, and larger shifts were associated with poorer survival. An acceptable 75-percent 24-hour posttransfusion survival was achieved for p50 increases up to approximately 15 torr. Cells that survived 24 hours appeared to have a normal lifespan. This study is the first demonstration of adequate survival for human RBCs with a potentially long-lasting decrease in oxygen affinity.\r"

Since the onset of HIV-1 donor screening in April 1985, a marked reduction in seroprevalence has been seen at the authors' institutions: from 51 cases per 100,000 donors in 1985 to 13 per 100,000 in the first 6 months of 1988. Data from 3.5 years have been analyzed for temporal trends in the association of HIV-1 seroprevalence with donation site (urban vs. non-urban) and donor gender. The association of HIV-1 seropositivity with an urban donation site decreased through 1987 as the urban-to-nonurban donation odds ratio declined from 6.48 in 1985 to 2.54 in 1987. Despite this decrease, both men and women who donated in urban areas had a significantly higher seroprevalence than those in nonurban areas. Male donors had a higher overall HIV-1 seroprevalence than female donors. However, the male-to-female odds ratio declined from 2.94 in 1985 to 1.96 in 1988, and male gender was no longer significantly associated with HIV-1 seropositivity. This change in the donor profile appears to reflect declining numbers of seropositive men who acknowledge risk factors and greater numbers of women with no identified risks for HIV-1. This study documents a dramatic decrease in HIV-1-seropositive donors and suggests that the deferral of high-risk individuals has become increasingly successful.\r"

All seven recipients developed septic shock after receiving units of red cells (RBCs) contaminated with Y. enterocolitica; five recipients died. The cases occurred in seven states and were unrelated. There was no evidence for contamination of the RBC units during processing. Six of the seven donors had serologic evidence of recent Y. enterocolitica infection, and it is hypothesized that these donors had asymptomatic bacteremia when they donated the implicated blood. Four of the seven donors reported gastrointestinal illness in the 4 weeks before blood donation, and one donor became ill on the day he donated blood. Y. enterocolitica grows well at 4 degrees C and in the presence of dextrose and iron. If blood is contaminated at the time of collection, storage of the RBCs at 4 degrees C provides an ideal environment for bacterial growth and endotoxin production. These cases demonstrate the need for careful evaluation of patients with transfusion reactions for possible sepsis and suggest a need to screen prospective blood donors for mild gastrointestinal illness, including those illnesses not requiring physician evaluation or medication.\r"

  ".U": "90194339\r", 
  ".W": "An expanded \"look-back\" program has been developed, in which patients who may have been exposed to HIV through blood transfusion were identified via three triggers: the blood that they received was donated by persons who 1) have subsequently been reported to local health departments as meeting the diagnostic criteria for AIDS, 2) have donated since the introduction of anti-HIV screening and tested positive, or 3) have been found to be infected during investigation of reported transfusion-associated HIV infections. In comparing triggers, cross-referencing the list of patients reported to have AIDS (AIDS case list) proved to be the most efficient approach for identifying HIV-infected donors and transfusion recipients. Of the 7973 AIDS patients reported in eight Northern California counties as of December 1988, 316 (4.0%) were determined to have donated at Irwin Memorial Blood Centers between 1977 and 1985. Despite the logarithmic increase in reported cases of AIDS in the San Francisco Bay area over the last 5 years, the rate of detection of previous donors from AIDS case lists remained between 3.3 and 5.4 percent. These persons accounted for 69 percent of the identified infected donors, and their identification led to notification of 60 percent of potentially exposed recipients and 51 percent of known infected recipients. The crossreferencing of AIDS case listings with blood bank records was equally efficient for regions with low and high AIDS prevalence. National adoption of AIDS case list crossreferencing is recommended as an effective means of identifying previously unidentified infected recipients in an effort to limit the secondary spread of HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "Febrile reactions to platelet transfusions are a common problem. The platelet transfusion records from a 30-month period were analyzed to determine 1) when reactions occur in a transfusion sequence; 2) how frequently they recur; and 3) whether the choice of multiple-donor (pooled concentrates) or single-donor components (unmatched apheresis and HLA-compatible apheresis platelets) affected the reaction rate. Overall, 18.7 percent of all patients receiving platelets experienced reactions. A subset of 85 patients, who began platelet support with unmodified components during the study interval, were analyzed in detail. This group received 1204 unmodified transfusions (mean, 14.2/patient), which were associated with 171 reactions (per-transfusion reaction rate, 14.2%). Despite a higher mean white cell content, the transfusion of 438 unmatched single-donor platelets (10.84 x 10(8) white cells, 8.4% reaction rate) resulted in reactions significantly less often than did that of 583 pooled concentrates (8.53 x 10(8) white cells, 21.4% reaction rate) (p less than 0.001). The rate of reaction to HLA-compatible platelets (9/183 transfusions, 4.9%) was not significantly different from that to unmatched single-donor platelets. The use of platelet components from one donor, as opposed to multiple donors, may provide an effective means of reducing the incidence of febrile reactions.\r"

The antibody strongly agglutinated all e-positive RBCs and gave negative reactions with RBCs from Rhnull persons and those homozygous for Rh deletion genes. Variable reactivity was found with e-negative RBCs, ranging from weak to negative with R2R2, slightly stronger with r\"r\", and stronger still with RzRz. These reactions, together with results from tests with a large panel of Rh-variant RBCs, suggested a specificity for an epitope that is part of the e mosaic but is also expressed at least partially on e-negative RBCs and is influenced by the presence of C. This antibody has been standardized for use as a screening reagent for R2R2 cells by a microplate technique, and over 6000 donations have been screened in this way. No discrepancies have been found in confirmatory tests for e-negative status using human anti-e.\r"

The use of modified M glycoprotein preparations for inhibition tests and of variant McN and Henshaw red cell membranes for immunoblotting showed that M2A1 recognized an epitope including the NH2-terminal serine and sialic acid residues of glycophorin A, whereas the fifth glycine residue was not involved. The reactivity of the antibody with M antigen was distinctly dependent on ionic strength and pH; the optimum was at pH 8 to 9. The alpha-amino group of terminal serine residue was not necessary for the reaction with M2A1 antibody, and the results obtained suggested that the positive charge of this group contributed to decreasing antigen-antibody reactions at pH below 8. The reaction of the antibody with blood group N antigen was not detectable in any of the assays used.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred autologous whole blood donors (11 men, 89 women; 49 preoperative, 51 prenatal) completed a questionnaire concerning their motivations as autologous donors, their perceptions of the relative safety of blood donor options, and their interest in directed donations. Concern about acquiring AIDS from transfusion was the most prevalent reason for autologous donation. Nearly all participants knew that autologous blood was safer than volunteer blood, and most also believed that directed-donor blood was safer than volunteer blood. Most would have used a directed-donor program if available, particularly if they were ineligible as autologous donors. Furthermore, their interest in directed donations was unaffected by written material, provided pathway through the questionnaire, that included a statement that no scientific evidence exists to support directed donations' being safer than volunteer blood. One donor in five believed that autologous and directed donations were equivalent in safety, and 19 (15 of whom were prenatal donors) indicated that they probably or surely would not have participated in the autologous program if directed donations had been available. This study demonstrates that a sizable proportion of autologous donor candidates might not participate if a directed donation program were available. The unrestricted availability of directed donations may thus contribute to suboptimal use of autologous donor programs.\r"

Donors at greatest risk for reaction were autologous donors who had reactions at first donation; among 45 who made repeat donations for the same surgery, 17 (38%) had repeat reactions. The group least likely to experience reactions were the autologous donors greater than or equal to 66 years old; they experienced a 1.9 greater than or equal to percent (6/310) incidence of reactions. More reactions were seen in both autologous and homologous donors in the categories of first-time donor, female gender, decreasing age, and lower weight. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that all of these variables were independent predictors of donor reaction, with first-time donation (odds ratio, 2.4) and female gender (odds ratio, 1.9) being the strongest predictors of reaction. Donor room personnel should be alerted that autologous donors who react at first donation are very likely to react at subsequent donations. Contrary to common concern, elderly autologous donors are least likely to have reactions.\r"

Results of a baseline audit of FFP use were compared to those of a study subsequent to the educational process. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that the decrease in the number of patients transfused with FFP, from 32 of 2077 operative cases in Group A (baseline) to 18 of 2540 operative cases in Group B (after education), was significant (p less than 0.01). Analysis of the justifications given for transfusion of FFP revealed that the increase in acceptable indications from 47 percent in Group A to 78 percent in Group B was also significant (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in units of FFP transfused per patient (Group A, 3.66 +/- 3.2, vs. Group B, 2.47 +/- 1.7) or red cells (Group A, 2.84 +/- 5.2, vs. Group B, 5.22 +/- 4.4), and the patterns of platelet transfusion were similar in the two groups. There was a significant difference in the postoperative partial thromboplastin time (Group A, 38.2 +/- 8.7 vs. Group B, 56.3 +/- 24 seconds, p less than 0.01) but no significant difference in postoperative prothrombin time (Group A, 14.1 +/- 2.6 vs. Group B, 15.4 +/- 3.3 seconds). It can be concluded that an educational program designed to address misconceptions in transfusion practice can alter physician performance and thereby reduce the inappropriate use of FFP.\r"

The clinical relevance of the antibody was correctly predicted by an in vitro monocyte monolayer assay. The finding that this example of anti-Lu6 was clinically significant should not be taken to mean that all antibodies directed against high-incidence Lutheran and Lutheran system-related antigens will behave similarly. When such antibodies are encountered, in vivo and/or in vitro studies to assess their clinical significance are necessary before rare blood is used for transfusion.\r"

  ".W": "A patient with known cold autoimmune hemolyticanemia was admitted for surgery. Routine cold agglutinin evaluations, using commercial red cells (RBCs) in modified Alsever's preservative solution, revealed a cold agglutinin titer of 4 to 16. However, using RBCs washed four times with saline, a high-titer (greater than 2000 at 4 degrees C) cold autoagglutinin was demonstrated. The cold agglutinin was shown to be an IgM kappa paraprotein with anti-Pr1d specificity. The addition of Alsever's solution to washed RBCs inhibited the cold agglutinin. Each major component of Alsever's solution (neomycin, chloramphenicol, inosine, dextrose, and citrate) was tested individually; only citrate inhibited the patient's cold agglutinin. Various compounds structurally related to citrate were tested and found to cause various degrees of inhibition. The strongest inhibition correlated with the presence of either three carboxyl groups on molecules devoid of double-bonded carbon atoms or two carboxyl groups in cis configuration. A panel of 54 cold agglutinins, including 7 with anti-Pr specificity, was analyzed. None was significantly inhibited by Alsever's solution, although one with anti-Pr2 specificity was weakly inhibited. In summary, these studies describe an anti-Pr1d cold autoagglutinin that was inhibited by citrate in RBC preservative solutions. The failure to detect such a cold agglutinin can result from not washing RBCs free of citrate before testing.\r"

There were 915 responses (41.6%); 785 responses (86%) contained sufficient data for analysis. The majority (70.6%) of 785 responding hospitals were community/urban institutions. However, more highly specialized, pediatric hospitals were also represented by 92 university/tertiary-care hospitals (11.7% of respondents) and 29 children's hospitals (3.7% of respondents). Two-thirds of hospitals performed a major antiglobulin crossmatch (rather than an abbreviated one) before all neonatal red cell transfusions. The red cell preparation most frequently selected for small-volume transfusions was ABO and Rh group-specific red cell concentrates. When performing only large-volume exchange transfusions, 19.2 percent of hospitals used whole blood; all others prepared reconstituted units of red cells plus fresh-frozen plasma, a practice that frequently causes exposure to two donors per unit. Another practice likely leading to multiple donor exposure is the use of fresh-frozen plasma to adjust the hematocrit of red cell preparations to a predetermined value prior to a small-volume transfusion. Over one-half of hospitals adjusting hematocrits used plasma, presumably from one donor, to dilute packed red cells from another donor, a practice that has no apparent medical benefit. Most hospitals (63.4%) provided red cells with a reduced risk of transmitting cytomegalovirus; blood from seronegative donors was selected by 65 percent of hospitals. The majority of hospitals, including most of the community/urban hospitals, did not irradiate blood products before transfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
