  ".W": "Pretherapeutic identification of patients likely to benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy for head and neck epidermoid cancer is of interest. We retrospectively analyzed the pretherapeutic computed tomographic (CT) scans of lymph nodes of 70 patients with head and neck cancer. All 70 patients were clinically classified as having stage IV disease. The purpose of our analysis was to compare the prognostic value of CT node density with that of the following factors: age, T and N categories, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, tumor site, histopathologic type of disease [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UNCT)], and type of local-regional treatment. A simple two-grade nodal density grading system was devised. The density of normal adjacent muscle was chosen as the density standard. A node was classified grade 1 if less than 33% of the node consisted of hypodense zones. A node was classified grade 2 if more than 33% of the node consisted of hypodense zones. Patients with grade 1 nodes had a complete response rate of 68% (21/31) compared with 8% (3/39) for those with grade 2 nodes (P less than .0001). The only other factor associated with complete node response was UCNT (P less than .03). However, node density remained the significant prognostic factor after adjustment for histopathologic type. Follow-up ranged from 16 to 44 months, with a median of 29 months. Patients with grade 1 nodes had a median survival time of 32 months versus 13 months for those with grade 2 nodes (P less than .01). A prospective study should validate the prognostic value of CT node density and its possible use in determining optimal multimodal therapy for advanced head and neck cancers.\r"

When reported as a urine iron to creatinine ratio the results from isolated urine specimens can be utilized to guide deferoxamine therapy. This method is rapid, simple and inexpensive and utilizes equipment and reagents found in laboratories already providing emergency serum iron concentrations. We have found this assay to be useful as a criterion for the cessation of deferoxamine therapy in the acutely iron poisoned patient and as an objective indicator of a positive deferoxamine chelation challenge.\r"

Two episodes of isopropanol ingestion were observed within a 9 month period in patient one. Isopropanol terminal elimination rate constants were 0.043 and 0.085 per hour (per h) with no marked difference in acetone terminal elimination rate constants (0.025 and 0.033 per h). Discrepancy between the two isopropanol elimination rate constants reflected concomitant ethanol abuse with the first ingestion. Reductions in isopropanol and acetone half-lives were also noted among patients requiring ventilatory support.\r"

The patients were primarily treated in internal medicine wards (65%) and in pediatric wards (16.3%). Seasonal variation was seen for agents such as oils, carbon monoxide, solvents, psychotropics, mushrooms and pesticides. Poisonings due to psychotropic drugs occurred at a steady rate during the period. For example, in 1984 there were 21.3 admissions per 100,000 inhabitants per year. Neuroleptics were the most common psychotropic drugs. Antidepressants caused fewer poisonings than did sleeping pills, which increased steadily to 13.9/100,000 inhabitants. Poisonings due to cardiovascular drugs declined, paralleling a decrease in digoxin prescriptions. During the period studied there were 13 to 14 admissions/100,000 inhabitants/year due to alcohol. The rate of cases of corrosive and solvent intoxication was steady at about 3 admissions/100,000 inhabitants/year.\r"

The metabolic acidosis improved 15 hours after treatment but nystagmus, apnea and convulsions were progressive. Although his sensorium was clear, spontaneous respirations were not observed for 64 hours. The electroencephalographic findings of atypical triphasic waves and slow waves suggest a unique response to bialaphos poisoning.

  ".W": "This study was designed to evaluate a historic cohort of pure tricyclic antidepressant overdose patients for factors associated with severe toxicity. Hospitalized tricyclic antidepressant overdose patients were identified by computerized discharge diagnosis (ICD-9 codes). Patients with a serum drug screen positive for tricyclic antidepressants and an emergency department 12-lead electrocardiogram were included in the study. Multiple drug overdoses were excluded. Patients were divided into two groups: minor toxicity (n = 41 and major toxicity (n = 65). Criteria for inclusion in the major toxicity group were the occurrence of seizures, endotracheal intubation, coma, arrhythmias requiring treatment, hypotension, or death. The following were found to be associated with increased likelihood of major toxicity (p less than 0.05): ingestion of amitriptyline (odds ratio (OR) 2.57), age greater than or equal to 30 years (OR 2.56), heart rate greater than or equal to 120 bpm (OR 2.86), serum tricyclic antidepressant level greater than or equal to 800 ng/mL (OR 5.20), terminal 40 ms QRS axis (T40-ms axis) greater than or equal to 135 degrees (OR 2.73), QRS interval greater than or equal to 100 ms (OR 2.74), QRS axis greater than 90 degrees (OR 3.68), and QTc interval greater than 480 ms (OR 3.89). The mean T40-ms axis on the initial ECG was more rightward in the major toxicity group (174 +/- 84 vs 125 +/- 91 degrees, p = 0.006). We conclude that patients with severe tricyclic antidepressant toxicity tended to have a more rightward T40-ms axis than those with minor toxicity and that the presence of the above parameters was associated with an increased likelihood of severe toxicity.\r"

The neonate required a serum concentration of phenobarbital eventually exceeding 80 micrograms/mL for seizure control. However, due to the severe CNS injury as a result of the asphyxia at birth, a diagnosis of cerebral death by electroencephalogram and apnea test was pursued. This required the phenobarbital concentration to be less than 30 micrograms/mL. Serial phenobarbital concentrations during this time indicated a 250 hour half-life, which would require two weeks for the phenobarbital to drop below 30 micrograms/mL. With the administration of six doses of activated charcoal at 0.7 g/kg/dose, the phenobarbital serum concentration decreased to 22 micrograms/mL, giving an estimated phenobarbital half-life of 22 hours. This, and two other subsequent cases, indicates repeated doses of activated charcoal are effective in augmenting the clearance of certain drugs in the neonatal age group.\r"

Serum was tested for anti-ARS antibodies using a solid phase radioimmunoassay. The antisera bound to ARS conjugated to the synthetic copolymer glutamic acid60 tyrosine30 when diluted as high as 1:4096. Following multiple injections of 100 micrograms of arsanilic acid--ovalbumin compound, mortality on injection with sodium arsenite 0.87 mg/kg i.p. one week later decreased to 0 deaths in 22 pretreated mice vs 9 deaths in 29 untreated mice (31% mortality; p less than .005). No decrease in mortality was noted at higher challenges (1.15 mg/kg) of sodium arsenite. Antisera from pretreated mice was injected 0.1 cc i.p. into 12 week old female balb/c mice followed by an injection of sodium arsenite 0.87 mg/kg i.p. at 10 minutes. Again a protective effect was observed with 0 deaths in 18 mice vs eight deaths in 21 mice (38%; p less than .005). Seventeen additional mice were given an injection of 0.87 mg/kg i.p. of sodium arsenite. After 30 minutes, all mice became symptomatic whereupon antisera 0.1 cc i.p. was given. The one day mortality (2/17, 12%) was possibly lower than the combined control mortality (17/50, 34%; p less than 0.07). There was no change in mortality noted when antisera was administered to mice acutely exposed to 5 mg/kg HgCl2.\r"

Thirty victims manifested the typical neurologic symptoms of tetrodotoxin poisoning. Although hypotension is the classically described blood pressure reaction, eight individuals developed hypertension (average blood pressure 192/110 mm Hg); one died of acute pulmonary edema. Semi-quantitative tetrodotoxin bioassay of two uneaten ovaries revealed tetrodotoxin concentrations of 54 Mouse Units/gm and 287 Mouse Units/gm, respectively. To gain insight into the unusual phenomenon of hypertension observed in our outbreak, we interviewed the victims, performed a funduscopic exam for hypertensive retinopathy and checked their blood pressure periodically in the ensuing year. Mild hypertension evidenced by retinopathy and elevated blood pressure was found in all seven who manifested hypertension during the acute event and survived. We postulate that individuals with pre-existing hypertension responded to the relatively small doses of tetrodotoxin with a dramatic rise in blood pressure. This resulted in the fatal outcome for one individual with severe coronary artery disease. Hypertension should be recognized as a possible feature of tetrodotoxin poisoning, especially in predisposed individuals.\r"

In this paper we present observations on workers exposed to, or poisoned by, ethylparathion. Acetylcholinesterase decreased earlier and more intensely than cholinesterase, with the suggestion of an initial increase of acetylcholinesterase activity in newly exposed, workers. A simplified standard Ellman assay of total acetylcholinesterase activity of hemolyzed total blood correlated with that of washed erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase. All results were standardized to both red blood cell and hemoglobin concentration. Normal values in a group of unexposed subjects were acetylcholinesterase: 1225 +/- 181 nU x 10/RBC and 39.30 +/- 5.05 U/g Hb for men, 1321 +/- 234 nU x 10/RBC and 42.57 +/- 6.85 U/g Hb for women. Differences between total and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase were not statistically significant. Plasma cholinesterase appeared to be decreased in pregnancy and increased in anesthesia, liver and kidney disease and neuropathologic conditions attributed to metal poisoning while total acetylcholinesterase was unaffected. The determination of both cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase assists the evaluation of individuals exposed to or poisoned by organophosphate, the differentiation of other conditions affecting cholinesterase and the recognition of genetically atypical cholinesterase.\r"

Eleven of the cases resulted in fatalities, all among those attempting suicide. The average amount ingested by survivors was 120 +/- 112 mL and by nonsurvivors was 263 +/- 100 mL (p less than or equal to 0.0001). The average age of survivors was 35 +/- 15 years compared to 54 +/- 11 years for fatalities (p less than or equal to 0.0002). Irritation of the oral mucous membrane and gastrointestinal tract was the most frequently reported effect. Other effects recorded were pulmonary dysfunction, oliguria, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, leukocytosis and fever. Fourteen patients received either atropine or pralidoxime plus atropine despite the fact that glyphosate does not inhibit acetylcholinesterase. Thirteen percent of patients received a urine test for paraquat or treatment customarily used for paraquat ingestion, possibly reflecting similar initial presentations following ingestion of these two herbicides. Laboratory differentiation is essential if any doubt exists about which herbicide was ingested. Patients ingesting large volumes of concentrated glyphosate-surfactant herbicide formulations require close observation and supportive treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The sexual differentiation of a gonad is determined in normal embryology by the presence or absence of the TDF gene, a short segment of DNA localized near the tip of the short arm of the Y chromosome. Under the stimulus of this gene, the somatic cells of the genital ridge differentiate into Sertoli cells and secrete anti-mullerian hormone. This hormone inhibits the germ cells from entering meiosis and may well also trigger the formation of the primary sex cords. Once the Sertoli cells are formed, further differentiation of the gonad is independent of the TDF presence, although this gene may further contribute to the normal functioning of the male gonad. In true hermaphroditism the normal regulation of the gonadal differentiation is missing. Gonadal differentiation may revert to a more primitive evolutionary level at which the rate of growth of the gonad determines its sexual direction. When this exceeds a certain threshold a testis may develop despite the absence of the TDF gene.\r"

A stone-free rate of 93% was achieved. In 3.6% of the patients, mainly those with a history of surgery and/or anatomical caliceal deformations, fragments smaller than 3 mm. in diameter remained despite multiple ESWL sessions and intensive upside down physiotherapy. Of the cases 3.4%, including those without sufficient data, were considered unsuccessful. We treated 58 renal units in children 14 years old and younger, 55 patients had a single kidney and 7 had a horseshoe kidney.\r"

  ".W": "Ureteral stents reduce complications after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) and contribute to successful stone passage. However, some reports note complications that are attributed to indwelling ureteral stents. We randomized 64 patients with large renal calculi (stone burden more than 200 mm.2) for in situ treatment or treatment with a prophylactically inserted stent. We used a 6Ch round stent with single-coiled ends or a triangular shaped stent with double-coiled ends. Patients were treated with a Siemens Lithostar lithotriptor. After 3 months we evaluated the results of treatment and post-ESWL morbidity. Of the in situ group (23 patients) treatment complications consisted of fever in 3, pyelonephritis in 1 and steinstrasse in 3. After 3 months 8 patients (35%) were free of stones. Of the stented population (41 patients) treatment complications consisted of fever in 7, pyelonephritis in 1, steinstrasse in 6 and bladder discomfort in almost half of the patients. Stent calcification and stent migration were also seen in 7 and 10 patients, respectively. Calcified stents had been in situ longer than noncalcified stents. The round stents migrated and calcified more often than the more rigid triangular stents. After 3 months 18 of the stented patients were stone-free (44%). We conclude that ureteral stents do not reduce post-ESWL complications. They are clearly associated with morbidity and do not improve stone passage markedly. Therefore, patients with a stone burden of more than 200 mm.2 should be treated in situ without auxiliary stenting.\r"

We report on 29 patients with large renal calculi treated with a combination of percutaneous nephrolithotripsy and ESWL. Stone-free rates were determined by plain abdominal radiograph, renal tomography and flexible nephroscopy. The plain abdominal radiograph and renal tomography overestimated stone-free rates by 35% and 17%, respectively, compared to flexible nephroscopy. To determine stone-free rates after ESWL renal tomography is superior to a plain abdominal radiograph alone. Also, among patients with large renal calculi the use of the flexible nephroscope markedly improves the stone-free rate.\r"

In the remaining patients residual fragments after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy were treated with a combination of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), chemolysis and retrieval of small calculi with a flexible nephroscope.

Retrograde and antegrade percutaneous nephrostolithotomy in conjunction with ESWL, chemolysis and flexible nephroscopy in the treatment of patients with complex calculi yield comparable success rates. However, retrograde percutaneous nephrostolithotomy can be performed without the aid of an interventional radiologist and it provides easy access to the nondilated collecting system.\r"

A total of 44 catheters had a suture attached to the bladder end of the catheter, which exited from the urethral meatus to facilitate removal. The remaining 29 catheters had no suture attached. Symptoms were evaluated at 2 and 6 days after insertion and 1 week following removal of the catheter, and included urinary frequency, nocturia, hematuria, flank pain, suprapubic pain, dysuria and pain on removal of the catheter. Frequency and nocturia were evaluated in minutes, pain was graded on a subjective scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain), and dysuria and hematuria were assessed qualitatively. There were no significant differences among the 4 types of catheters in terms of frequency, nocturia, hematuria, flank pain, suprapubic pain and dysuria. In addition, there was no significant difference in urinary symptoms between catheters with and without a suture at either 2 or 6 days after insertion nor was there any difference in pain on removal of catheters with (mean 3.9) and without (mean 5.0) suture. We found that catheter composition and use of suture to facilitate removal did not significantly affect patient morbidity.\r"

We have extended that initial report to encompass 15 patients with 19 ureteroenteric strictures followed for an average of 2.5 years. In all cases an endosurgical approach was well tolerated, blood loss was less than 50 cc and hospital stay averaged 3.5 days. A 16 to 22F external stent was left in place for 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively in 14 strictures. A permanent external 12F catheter was left in 5 strictures due to the presence of metastatic disease (4) and a complete dense stricture (1). The only major complication was a ureteroenteric fistula that healed over a ureteral stent without any open surgical intervention. Among 14 ureteroenteric strictures in which the stent was removed, the ureteroenteric area has remained patent in 8 (57%) with an average followup of 28.6 months (range 9 to 57 months). Failures were associated with metastatic disease in 2 cases, generalized debility in 2 and unexplained in 2. In this series an endosurgical approach to ureteroenteric strictures provided long-term satisfactory management of the problem in the majority of patients with benign and malignant disease. By current standards, only 1 patient (7%) would have been considered a candidate for open surgical repair.\r"

Men and women in the 70 and older age group had the same voiding frequency (mean 5.0). In men frequency of urination was related to benign prostatic enlargement and 2 of 4 symptoms of urinary obstruction (change in the force of the urinary stream and having to urinate again shortly after voiding). In women frequency was related negatively to a history of pregnancy complications but not to parity. In both sexes frequency was unrelated to the reported daily ingestion of coffee, tea or diuretics, and no relationships were found with a history of an anxiety disorder.\r"

However, recent data from our laboratory have shown that the bladder epithelium in animals and humans relies primarily on its surface glycosaminoglycans to maintain its impermeability. This study demonstrates the first disease associated with an epithelial dysfunction of the bladder, that is a leaky epithelium. The study consisted of 31 normal subjects and 56 individuals with interstitial cystitis. Interstitial cystitis patients were shown to have a leaky epithelium by placing a solution of concentrated urea into the bladder and measuring the absorption. The normal subjects absorbed 4.3% in 45 minutes, while the interstitial cystitis patients absorbed 25% (difference is highly significant, p less than 0.005). Interstitial cystitis patients with Hunner's ulcers (10) had a 34.5% absorption rate, while those without ulcers absorbed 22.8% (46). This difference also was highly significant (p = 0.002) and supports the concept that patients with ulcers have clinically worse disease.\r"

Those patients with hemodynamically significant atherosclerosis had smoked more pack-years than had patients without arterial disease. These differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.05) for the common penile artery (32.8 pack-years, 40 patients versus 22.3 pack-years 57 patients) and the dorsal artery (31.3 pack-years, 48 patients versus 22.0 pack-years, 49 patients). The effect of cigarette smoking as an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease in the hypogastric-cavernous arterial bed was evaluated as well. When controlled for age, trauma history, hypertension and diabetes, cigarette smoking was independently associated with atherosclerosis in the internal pudendal artery (p less than 0.05). The relative risk (and 95% confidence interval) of developing internal pudendal artery atherosclerosis for each 10 pack-years smoked was 1.31 (1.05 to 1.64). A third analysis investigated the potential interactive effects of cigarette smoking and pelvic or perineal trauma. A significantly higher incidence (p less than 0.05) of cavernous artery atherosclerosis was found among smokers with a history of chronic perineal trauma (33 patients) compared to nonsmokers with a similar history (25 patients). The findings of this study indicate that cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor in the development of atherosclerotic lesions in the internal pudendal and common penile arteries of young impotent men. Cigarette smoking appears to predispose these patients to early atherosclerotic lesions in the cavernous artery following chronic perineal trauma.\r"

We report on 6 patients who presented with an unusual sequela of veno-occlusive priapism, recurrent episodes of prolonged erections or priapism. In all cases the subsequent episodes were idiopathic and veno-occlusive, occurred with a frequency ranging from several times per day to once per month and were symptomatically disabling. Pharmacocavernosometry ruled out mechanical occlusion of corporeal venous drainage by demonstrating elevated flows to maintain intracavernosal pressures following smooth muscle contraction and markedly decreased flow rates following smooth muscle relaxation. Treatment of the recurrent episodes with intracavernous self-injection of phenylephrine resulted in successful detumescence. The use of oral phenylpropanolamine reduced the frequency and duration of the recurrences, and markedly reduced the need for adrenergic self-injection. It is proposed that this syndrome may develop secondary to the initial ischemic episode, resulting in a functional alteration of the adrenergic and/or endothelial-mediated mechanisms that control penile tumescence and maintain penile flaccidity.\r"

  ".W": "Infusion pharmacocavernosometry and nocturnal penile tumescence findings were compared in 50 men with erectile dysfunction of either organic or psychogenic etiology. Of the men 29 had abnormal and 21 had normal nocturnal penile tumescence. Infusion pharmacocavernosometry parameters (equilibrium pressure, maintenance flow rate and 30-second pressure fall) were compared to nocturnal penile tumescence status (normal versus abnormal). When traditional normal values were used for infusion pharmacocavernosometry parameters poor correlation with nocturnal penile tumescence status was found. When new cutpoints for infusion pharmacocavernosometry parameters were chosen a stronger correlation was noted. This study suggests that when vasoactive drugs are injected intracavernously for diagnostic purposes, anxiety and/or the absence of sexual stimulation following the injection may prevent complete cavernous smooth muscle relaxation resulting in falsely abnormal values. Therefore, over reliance on infusion pharmacocavernosometry as a single test for evaluation and treatment decisions concerning erectile dysfunction should be avoided.\r"

This technique is performed without resection of the tunica albuginea, although in the case of calcified plaques the calcifications themselves are removed, preserving the overlying tunica. Between September 1988 and February 1990, 12 patients have undergone this procedure, all of whom have greater than 3 months of followup and have experienced spontaneous erections within the first week postoperatively. Of the patients 11 resumed intercourse within 8 weeks of surgery and 1 required 12 weeks. No patient had sensory loss postoperatively and there has been no donor site morbidity. Correction of curvature was accomplished in all patients and there have been no recurrences within a maximal followup of 22 months. Within the limitations of such a small study we believe that there is evidence supporting this approach in potent patients with severe acquired penile curvature.\r"

A possible cause of this atrophy is interference with the testicular blood supply by placement of a testicular traction suture through the tunica albuginea. Arterial casts of 32 adult human testes were created following placement of a 3-zero silk traction suture through the lower pole of the testis to determine the effects of this suture upon intragonadal arterial circulation. Significant arterial blockage, manifested as failure of the parenchymal branches to fill, was observed in 14% of the casts produced via injection through the internal spermatic artery and in 100% of the casts produced via injection through the deferential artery. The results of this study support discontinuing the routine use of parenchymal testicular traction sutures during orchiopexy.\r"

The study showed absence of valves in the spermatic vein, cross-communications between the right and left spermatic veins, and communication between the spermatic and renal capsular veins, spermatic and ipsilateral ureteral veins, and spermatic ipsilateral colonic veins. For clarification of the presence of valves intraoperative antegrade spermatic venography was done in 6 men with and 5 without varicocele. In both groups valves were not detected. These observations regarding the anatomy of the spermatic vein and the ovarian vein may help to explain related clinical conditions.\r"

To define the ability of color Doppler ultrasound to detect clinically evident as well as subclinical varicoceles men referred to our urology division with oligospermia and infertility underwent spermatic vein venography of the left testis if there was physical examination and/or color Doppler ultrasound evidence of a varicocele. The detection of valvular incompetence on venography was considered diagnostic for a varicocele. Of 17 study patients physical examination detected 10 of 14 venographically evident varicoceles (71%), whereas color Doppler ultrasound detected 13 of 14 (93%). Of 5 patients with a normal physical examination but with color Doppler ultrasound evidence of a varicocele 4 had a confirmatory venogram, and 1 of 2 patients with a varicocele on physical examination and a normal Doppler ultrasound had a positive venogram. These data suggest that color Doppler ultrasound of the testis may more appropriately direct further invasive testing and therapy of infertile men than physical examination alone.\r"

Our statistical approach specifies improvement as a change from individual baseline level. The over-all variability in sperm counts precluded the demonstration of significant changes in sperm density consequent to surgery. Improvement in sperm motility was seen in both groups, being slightly greater in the subclinical group. The changes were inversely related to baseline levels and increased with time from surgery. Therefore, it appears that the detection of subclinical varicoceles may be warranted in infertile men with abnormal semen parameters.\r"

The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC1) was calculated in each case by using the trapezoidal rule. In the control group the plasma level was determined at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after instillation. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC2) was calculated by the formula AUC2 = Co/Kc. The fraction F of absorption can be expressed as F = AUC1/AUC2; median F = 0.67 (range 0.41 to 0.92). We conclude that chlortetracycline passes readily and almost completely through the tunica vaginalis lining the hydrocele sac.\r"

Of the 84 patients 47 (56%) had positive lymph nodes at surgery. The median PSA value for all patients with nodal metastases was 11.4 ng/.ml., and for those without it was 11.2 ng./ml. Relative to Gleason score, median PSA values were 11.35 for 2-4, 12.2 for 5-7 and 10.9 ng./ml. for 8-10. Within each M.D. Anderson grade median PSA values were 10.15 for grade I, 13.2 for grade II, 12.7 for grade III and 10.5 ng./ml. for grade IV. Simultaneously drawn preoperative frozen serum samples for 28 of these patients were independently analyzed by the Yang radioimmunoassay. Comparing Hybritech and Yang methods revealed strong statistical co-association (correlation coefficient R2 = 97.36, p less than 0.00001) but neither assay was statistically associated with nodal metastasis. Although no PSA level excluded the presence of nodal disease, we suggest that a Hybritech PSA of greater than 30 ng./ml. and a Yang PSA of greater than 50 ng./ml. may serve as a weak adjunctive marker predicting nodal metastasis.\r"

  ".U": "91171388\r", 
  ".W": "The clinical significance of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) values in hormonally treated prostate cancer patients and the effect of hormonal therapy on the serum PSA concentration, independent of the response observed from its antitumor activity, are not well defined. To elucidate further the influence of antiandrogen therapy on serum PSA expression, 81 randomly selected patients with stage D2 prostate cancer were evaluated with respect to serum PSA concentration. These patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of previous hormonal therapy. Group 1 consisted of 43 patients 55 to 89 years old (mean age 71 years) who had received no prior therapy for prostate cancer. Group 2 included 38 men 58 to 84 years old (mean age 72 years) who had received only androgen deprivation therapy with either bilateral orchiectomy or diethylstilbestrol. The mean interval between initiation of antiandrogen therapy and evaluation of these patients was 14 months (range 8 to 31 months). At the time of PSA determination both groups were similar in all respects, including tumor grade, disease symptoms and bone scan findings. The median serum PSA concentration was 96.0 ng./ml. in group 1 and 16.5 ng./ml. in group 2 (p less than 0.001), despite both groups having similar symptoms and widespread metastatic disease on radionuclide bone scan. In group 1 only 1 patient (2%) had a serum PSA level less than 4.0 ng./ml., whereas 13 men (34%) in group 2 had a serum PSA concentration below 4.0 ng./ml. (p less than 0.001). Of the patients in group 1, 2% and of the men in group 2, 45% had a serum PSA concentration less than 10 ng./ml. (p less than 0.001). These findings demonstrate that the serum PSA level in prostate cancer patients treated hormonally may have a significantly different meaning than the same serum PSA value in patients without hormonal therapy. In addition, these observations suggest that PSA expression may be under hormonal regulation and that androgen deprivation therapy may have a direct effect on the serum PSA concentration, independent of the response obtained from any antitumor activity. However, the exact mechanism of this androgenic influence on PSA expression awaits further investigation at the cellular level.\r"

Computerized tomography and myelographic findings demonstrated complete subarachnoid block with an extramedullary spinal cord tumor. It was concluded that traction on the spinal cord producing neurological deterioration (spinal coning) occurred after removal of the cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture.\r"

  ".W": "There is increasing evidence that the urothelium of the bladder mucosa prevents the penetration of solutes from the urine into the bladder wall. In the current study, in vivo treatments of rabbit urinary bladder with DMSO, acetone and overdistension resulted in damage to the physical integrity of the bladder mucosa as quantitated by the penetration of the dye indigocarmine (1% in saline) into submucosal tissues. Penetration of the dye can be quantitated, because the dye can be extracted from the tissue and measured spectrophotometrically. Indigocarmine does not penetrate normal, control, bladder mucosae. Bladders treated with gentle 20, 30 and 50% acetone washes for one minute permit dye penetration which is proportional to the acetone concentration utilized. Intravesical 50% DMSO (\"RIMSO 50\") administration permits modest dye penetration. Distension by slow filling with saline to volumes 90% of capacity and greater causes a marked increase in dye penetration which is proportional to the magnitude of overdistension. Although pretreatment of the bladder with heparin did not reduce the dye penetration following acetone administration, it completely abolished penetration of the dye following overdistension. Indigocarmine is potentially useful as both a quantitative and qualitative indicator of bladder mucosal integrity.\r"

BrdUrd is incorporated into S-phase cells, and Ki-67 monoclonal antibody recognizes a nuclear antigen present in proliferating, but not resting cells. The percentage of labeled cells was expressed as the labeling index (LI). The average BrdUrd LI obtained applying this method to normal epithelium and to transitional cell carcinoma were 4.1% and 13.1%, respectively, while the Ki-67 LI had average values of 6.2% and 17.8%, respectively. Labeled cells were distributed throughout both the basal and surface layers of transitional cell carcinoma. In general, the value of the BrdUrd LI was correlated to that of the Ki-67 LI. A relatively large fraction of labeled cells was found in high grade or invasive tumors. Bladder tumors with lymph node involvement had higher LI than those without. In addition, a high frequency of S-phase cells within tumor tissue appeared to indicate a great potential for malignancy and thus a poor prognosis. These findings indicate that immunostaining with BrdUrd and Ki-67 may be useful tools for easy and quick evaluation of proliferating cells in bladder tumors.\r"

Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of type-specific HPV sequences, we have assessed the prevalence of HPV DNA in prostate tissue from 88 individuals. Amplified sequences specific for HPV 16 were found in 34 of 56 benign prostatic hyperplasias and in 14 of 27 prostatic carcinomas. In contrast, HPV 18 was identified in only three benign hyperplasias and one carcinoma, all of which also contained HPV 16 DNA. Four of five normal prostates obtained at autopsy had no detectable HPV infection; one contained HPV 16 sequences. No significant difference in the prevalence of HPV DNA is observed between patients with benign disease and those with evidence of malignancy when fragments of surgical material are analyzed. Surgical method (transurethral resection or suprapubic prostatectomy) had no effect on the frequency of HPV detection. The prevalence of HPV DNA in the small number of normal prostates analyzed was not significantly different from that in the surgical samples. The presence of HPV in prostate tissues suggests a possible reservoir for sexual transmission of types with oncogenic potential. A role for the virus in the etiology of prostatic neoplasia remains to be demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a new model of partial urethral obstruction using the guinea pig. We placed jeweler's jump rings loosely around the proximal urethra of immature guinea pigs and allowed the obstruction to develop gradually as the animal grew. After four or eight weeks of obstruction, we studied the filling and emptying characteristics of the bladder during continuous repetitive cycling under urethane anesthesia. Following this examination, bladders were removed and weighed. Wet weight was compared to urodynamic findings. We identified four abnormal urodynamic patterns: high pressure voiding, instability, poor compliance and decompensation. All obstructed bladders showed weight gain associated with muscle hypertrophy, but the degree of weight gain was different for each of the various urodynamic categories. High pressure voiding was associated with the least weight gain, whereas instability and decompensation showed the most weight gain. The results are consistent with a thesis that partial urethral outlet obstruction in the guinea pig gives rise to several distinct forms of abnormal voiding characterized by high pressure in the early stages, and progressing to more advanced forms of dysfunction characterized by instability and decompensation in the later stages.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this project was to create a reproducible, quantifiable feline model of obstructive uropathy. Seventy-three adult female cats of comparable age were evaluated to obtain the normal control urodynamic data base. Twenty-four cats had a silastic cuff installed around the urethra to induce bladder outlet obstruction, and eight underwent a sham operation. Repeated urodynamic evaluations were performed at predetermined postoperative intervals. The obstructed and normal cats inhibited detrusor contractility by reflex striated urethral sphincter activity. Measurements of voiding pressure to verify the presence, and to assess the degree of induced outlet obstruction, required paralysis of the sphincter by curare. Following cuff implantation, voiding pressure increased from a mean normal of 17.2 cm./H2O to 31.6 to 42.5 cm./H2O in animals designated as moderately obstructed, and to 101.7-125.0 cm./H2O in animals designated as severely obstructed. 84.6% of the high pressure bladders developed vesicoureteral reflux. Analysis of resting, low bladder volume, urethral pressure profile (UPP) data and voiding pressures indicate a compensatory sphincteric response to filling in non-curarized animals, and a lack of that response in curarized animals. It appears that implantation of a silastic cuff to prevent full opening of the urethra during voiding, without actually compressing it, is a reasonable model of obstructive uropathy. The observation that the relationship between striated urethral sphincter activity and inhibition of detrusor contractility is influenced by administration of curare was unexpected, and may have clinical implications.\r"

Pathologic evaluation of the kidneys revealed that both electrohydraulic and electromechanical lithotripsy resulted in an increased instance of acute subcapsular hematoma and fibrosis when compared to piezoelectric treated kidneys (p less than 0.001). Despite the definitive differences noted in the acute animals, there was no significant variation in the area of permanent renal damage that occurred between the various lithotripters.\r"

Some investigators believe that urinary proteins are selectively incorporated within urinary calculi and as such have an active role in stone formation. Other investigators believe that urinary proteins are nonspecifically adsorbed into urinary crystals and thus have only a passive role in stone formation. In the current investigation a previously described stone-forming animal model (hyperoxaluric rat) was utilized along with an animal model for renal tubular injury (gentamicin nephrotoxicity) in an effort to clarify the role of urinary proteins in kidney stone formation. Urine specimens were collected before and after the induction of stone formation and after the induction of renal tubular injury. The purified proteins from each urine specimen were separated in two dimensions by electrophoresis resulting in a characteristic \"map\" of protein spots for each urine specimen. All animals in the stone-forming group had pathologic evidence of early stone formation (diffuse intranephronic calculosis). Early stone formation was consistently associated with a reduction in the excretion of low molecular weight urinary proteins (30,000 dalton and less than 20,000 dalton ranges). Alcian blue staining confirmed the presence of matrix within clumps of intranephronic calcium oxalate crystals. Renal tubular injury was associated with an increase in the excretion of low molecular weight proteins (approximate 20,000 dalton range) consistent with classical tubular proteinuria. These results suggest that low molecular weight urinary proteins are selectively incorporated within the crystalline structure of the stone early during its formation.\r"

  ".W": "Various agents have been implicated in inducing urothelial cancer. Although drugs, occupational and environmental carcinogens are more widely accepted as playing a major role as urothelial carcinogens, several investigations suggest that bacteria may play a role. The mechanism of how bacteria may interact with the host to augment the development of urothelial carcinoma is not well understood. Clinically, investigators have linked the development of infection, urinary stones and indwelling catheters with urothelial cancer. Other investigators have suggested that the mechanism may be related to the production of carcinogenic compounds (nitrosamines) which can be detected during urinary tract infection. In our laboratory, we showed that rats with chronic urinary tract infections produced increasing urinary levels of N,N dimethylnitrosamine over a 24 week period and that the production correlated with hyperplasia and early neoplasia of the bladder epithelium. Three bacterial genera were used and two of these (Escherichia coli and a protein sp.) showed production of increasing levels of urinary nitrosamine and correlated with infection. The purpose of this current study is to determine if other bacterial genera and strains can also produce similar increasing nitrosamine levels in the rat model of chronic urinary tract infection and thus provide evidence that a number of bacterial genera and strains can produce nitrosamines in vivo. Also, the histology of the chronically infected bladder was examined for hyperplasia and neoplasia.\r"

In order to determine the deleterious effects of temporal versus cumulative doses of shock wave administration, adult female rabbits were divided into five groups receiving either: 1000 shock waves in one session; 2000 shock waves in one session; 2000 shock waves in two sessions, one week apart; unilateral nephrectomy without lithotripsy; or anesthesia only as control population. One month following lithotripsy, renal functional studies for gamma glutamyl transferase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase revealed persistent enzymuria in the animals treated with 2000 shocks in one session. Pathologic studies in these animals confirmed an increased area of periglomerular and intratubular fibrosis when compared to animals managed by either 1000 shocks or 2000 shocks in divided doses (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest the importance of avoiding single treatments with large doses of shock waves and favor the administration of multiple small-doses of shock waves to minimize renal damage during the treatment of patients with hard or large calculi.\r"

To determine the hypocholesterolemic response of beta-glucan in the diet, 156 adults with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels above 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) or between 3.37 and 4.14 mmol/L (130 and 160 mg/dL) with multiple risk factors were randomized to one of seven groups. Six groups received either oatmeal or oat bran at doses (dry weight) of 28 g (1 oz), 56 g (2 oz), and 84 g (3 oz). A seventh group received 28 g of farina (beta-glucan control). At week 6 of treatment, significant differences were found for both total cholesterol and LDL-C levels among the farina control and the treatment groups who were receiving 84 g of oatmeal, 56 g of oat bran, and 84 g of oat bran, with decreases in LDL-C levels of 10.1%, 15.9%, and 11.5%, respectively. Fifty-six grams of oat bran resulted in significantly greater reductions in LDL-C levels than 56 g of oatmeal. Nutrient analysis shows no difference in dietary fat content between these treatment groups; therefore, the higher beta-glucan content of oat bran most likely explains the significantly greater LDL-C reductions. A dose-dependent reduction in LDL-C levels with oat cereals supports the independent hypocholesterolemic effects of beta-glucan.\r"

Ten rooms in four day-care centers containing 141 children were studied in a prospective, randomized, crossover study. A total of 2946 samples were cultured during the 9-week study. Fecal coliforms were isolated from 307 inanimate objects (15%), 73 toy balls (46%), and 131 hands (17%). The number of contaminated inanimate objects was significantly less in rooms where paper diapers were worn when compared with that in rooms where double cloth diapers with plastic overpants were worn and in rooms where clothes were worn over diapers. Inanimate object cultures had more contamination in rooms in which diarrhea had occurred. Containment of feces by overclothes and diaper type may be important in decreasing transmission of enteric pathogens in day-care environments.\r"

We surveyed a random national probability sample of 300 dentists with a 26-item survey in August and September 1990 to assess reactions to the report (response rate, 59%). Respondents tended not to believe the report (mean was 3.2, median 3.0, where 1 indicated \"do not believe\" and 7 indicated \"believe\"). Our sample also tended to believe that transmission of HIV from dentists to patients was unlikely in the future (mean was 2.0, median 2.0, where 1 indicated \"not at all likely\" and 7 indicated \"very likely\"). Fifty-one percent of our sample recommended that dentists infected with HIV should discontinue practice, while 38% recommended continuing practice with changes in procedures. Seventy-four percent believed patients should be told if their dentist was infected with HIV. In summary, dentists doubted the possibility of dentist-to-patient transmission of HIV and did not believe the Centers for Disease Control case report, but they did believe infected dentists should refrain from clinical work or modify their practice.\r"

We describe a 33-year-old woman with familial hypertriglyceridemia who had recurrent hyperlipidemic abdominal crises during previous pregnancies despite dietary fat restrictions. A fifth pregnancy was carried to term without complications after aggressive dietary therapy and intermittent intravenous feeding, administered whenever her triglyceride levels exceeded an arbitrarily selected threshold concentration of 28 mmol/L. The efficacy of this approach may be explained by the published observation that low-fat (high-carbohydrate) isocaloric diets elevate serum triglyceride levels by the oral, but not the intravenous, route in normal individuals. Reduction of this patient's serum triglyceride concentrations by interrupting oral intake and administering intravenous glucose appeared to prevent late-pregnancy pancreatitis and culminated in uncomplicated full-term delivery.\r"

To our knowledge, no studies in women have looked at endogenous estrogen levels as predictors of cardiovascular disease. Studies of surrogate measures of endogenous estrogen such as parity, age at menarche, and age at menopause have provided inconsistent results. Current use of oral contraceptives increases risk in older women who smoke cigarettes, but most studies of past use show no increased risk. Most, but not all, studies of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women show around a 50% reduction in risk of a coronary event in women using unopposed oral estrogen. These important observations need to be confirmed in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial, since the protection is biologically plausible and the magnitude of the benefit would be quite large if selection factors can be excluded.\r"

Consent to administer CPR is presumed since the patient is incapable at the moment of arrest of communicating his or her treatment preference, and failure to act immediately is certain to result in the patient's death. Two exceptions to the presumption favoring CPR have been recognized, however. First, a patient may express in advance his or her preference that CPR be withheld. If the patient is incapable of expressing a preference, the decision to forgo resuscitation may be made by the patient's family or other surrogate decision maker. Second, CPR may be withheld if, in the judgment of the treating physician, an attempt to resuscitate the patient would be futile. In December 1987, the American Medical Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs issued a series of guidelines to assist hospital medical staffs in formulating appropriate resuscitation policies. The Council's position on the appropriate use of CPR and do-not-resuscitate orders is updated in this report.\r"

Two regimens by which vaccine was injected intradermally into children between 0 and 4 years old led to peak geometric mean (95% CI) concentrations of antibody against HBV surface antigen of 270 (202-358) and 555 (418-748) mlU/ml. The third regimen--intramuscular vaccination of children aged between 0 and 4 years--gave geometric mean peak antibody concentrations of 926 (765-1122) mlU/ml. A fourth regimen was intramuscular vaccination of children between 1 and 9 months old, which gave geometric mean antibody concentrations of 5431 (3903-75,456) mlU/ml. Despite these widely divergent responses and a 89% decay in antibody over the first 2 years, vaccination against HBV was 97% effective in preventing chronic infection. Vaccination was less effective in preventing uncomplicated infection: 5.3% of 264 vaccinees in Keneba and 19.1% of 94 vaccinees in Manduar tested positive for antibody to HBV core antigen. These \"breakthrough infections\" did not differ in frequency between regimens, and were associated with low initial antibody responses and chronic maternal carriage of HBV.\r"

In the case-control study, 20 patients with CFS had lower red cell magnesium concentrations than did 20 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex, and social class (difference 0.1 mmol/l, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05 to 0.15). In the clinical trial, 32 patients with CFS were randomly allocated either to intramuscular magnesium sulphate every week for 6 weeks (15 patients) or to placebo (17). Patients treated with magnesium claimed to have improved energy levels, better emotional state, and less pain, as judged by changes in the Nottingham health profile. 12 of the 15 treated patients said that they had benefited from treatment, and in 7 patients energy score improved from the maximum to the minimum. By contrast, 3 of the 17 patients on placebo said that they felt better (difference 62%, 95% CI 35 to 90), and 1 patient had a better energy score. Red cell magnesium returned to normal in all patients on magnesium but in only 1 patient on placebo. The findings show that magnesium may have a role in CFS.\r"

However, exercise tolerance measured with a series of self-paced corridor walk tests showed moderate correlations with cardiac index (r = -0.404, p = 0.015 to r = -0.516, p = 0.001) and customary activity assessed by step counting correlated better with cardiac index (r = 0.537, p less than 0.001). Cardiac output therefore seems to be a factor determining patients' exercise capability when they choose their own walking speed but not when they undergo formal treadmill tests in the laboratory.\r"

These cardiovascular changes might be the result of increased synthesis of a vasodilator. Nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, is synthesised in and released from peripheral blood-vessels in man. Studies in animals indicate that bacterial endotoxin and cytokines induce NO synthase expression in vessel walls, with sustained NO release and consequent hypotension. Endotoxaemia is a common feature of cirrhosis; persistent induction of NO synthase may account for the associated haemodynamic changes.\r"

  ".U": "91171847\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical and laboratory manifestations, disease course, outcome, and HLA associations were studied in an inception cohort of 62 subjects with adult Still's disease (ASD) from 5 Canadian universities. Twenty-eight patients (45%) were female and the median age at disease onset was 24 years. In general, the clinical features observed in our patients were identical to those in other published series. However, significantly higher frequencies of sore throat (92%), weight loss (76%), lymphadenopathy (74%), pleuritis (53%), pneumonitis (27%), and abdominal pain (48%) were noted in our patients compared to those in a recent literature review. Liver involvement with hepatomegaly (44%) or abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) (76%) was common and was responsible for the 2 deaths attributed to Still's disease in our series. Severe liver failure always occurred in conjunction with aspirin or NSAID therapy. Therefore, whether or not aspirin or other NSAIDs are used, we recommend close monitoring of LFTs in patients with ASD, especially early in the disease course. Laboratory manifestations were similar to those already reported. Leukocytosis (greater than or equal to 15,000/mm3) was present in 50 patients (81%), a normochromic, normocytic anemia (hemoglobin less than or equal to 10 g/dl) in 42 (68%), and an elevated ESR in all. The mean follow-up of the 62 patients was 70 months (range, 2-163). Twenty-one patients (34%) had a self-limited disease course, 15 (24%) an intermittent course, and 22 (36%) a chronic disease course. Four patients (6%) died, and 2 of these deaths were attributed to Still's disease. For those patients who experienced a recurrence of ASD, the flares were usually of shorter duration and milder in severity than the initial episode. No initiating factor for disease exacerbation was identified in our patients. Although 22 of 62 patients (36%) had a chronic disease course, 52 (90%) were in ARA Functional Class I, and only 4 and 2 patients were in ARA Functional Class II and III, respectively. Patients with Still's disease had higher scores than the controls on the Pain (P less than 0.01) and Physical Disability (P less than 0.05) subscales of Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales health status questionnaire. Joint radiographs performed at the follow-up evaluation disclosed typical carpometacarpal and intercarpal involvement in 16 of 39 patients. In our series, HLA-B17, B18, B35, and DR2 were significantly associated with ASD. Three significant predictors of an unfavorable outcome, either a chronic disease course or a longer time to clinical remission, were identified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lymphoproliferative disease is seen in patients with both congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies. Lymphoproliferative disease has been reported in 1 to 3% of renal transplant recipients. Most patients presented with solid tumor masses, rather than an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. About one third of cases had involvement of the renal allograft with tumor; the small intestine or central nervous system was also frequently affected. About half of the patients survived. The most frequent therapy used for survivors was decreasing the dose of immunosuppressive therapy and surgical resection of lymphoproliferative lesions. Compared with fatal cases, survivors more often had evidence of active EBV infection (primary or reactivated), received cyclosporine as the major immunosuppressive agent, had polyclonal lesions, and had B-cell hyperplasia rather than lymphoma. Lymphoproliferative disease has been described in 5 to 13% of heart transplant recipients. In our review, the cardiac allograft was not involved by disease in any patient; however, the lungs were involved in more than half of the cases. The soft tissues were frequent sites of lymphoproliferative disease. All patients had lymphoma or immunoblastic sarcoma on pathology and all had monoclonal lesions. While only 8% of patients survived, about half died from causes unrelated to lymphoproliferative disease. EBV lymphoproliferative disease has been reported in 9% of heart-lung transplant recipients. Most of the patients presented with pulmonary symptoms and the pulmonary allograft was involved in 80% of cases. The large and small intestine were frequently affected. About 60% of patients survived; survivors were treated with acyclovir and decreases in the dose of immunosuppressive drugs. Lymphoproliferative disease has been described in 2% of liver transplant recipients. In our review, the hepatic allograft was involved in one third of cases; the tonsils, kidneys, and small intestine were frequently affected. Half of the patients survived; survivors were most often treated with reduction in immunosuppressive therapy and surgical resection of lesions. Compared with fatal cases, survivors had fewer organs involved and fewer monoclonal lesions. Lymphoproliferative disease has been reported in 1 to 2% of bone marrow transplant recipients. Use of T-cell depleted bone marrow and infusion of anti-T-cell antibodies to prevent graft-versus-host disease increased the risk of EBV lymphoproliferative disease. In our review, the bone marrow was involved by lymphoproliferative disease in one third of cases; the liver, spleen, kidney, and lungs were frequently affected. About 16% of patients survived; 2 survivors were treated with infusions of monoclonal anti-B-cell antibodies and 1 received interferon alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Ninety percent of primary and 43% of secondary cases had erythema migrans, while no late cases had active erythema migrans (p less than .001). Clinical manifestations of nonspecific inflammation, except for arthralgia, were more common in early than late disease (p less than .01). In secondary cases, monoarticular arthritis was slightly more common than polyarticular arthritis, with the reverse occurring in late disease (p less than .05). Indirect fluorescent antibody testing revealed a ratio of IgM to IgG antibodies to be helpful in distinguishing early from late disease. Antibacterial therapy in early, primary cases caused Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction 7% of the time. Despite longer and more frequent parenteral therapy, late Lyme disease frequently required retreatment, owing to poor clinical response (p less than .05).\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary edema is a relatively common problem facing most physicians. Its separation into cardiogenic and noncardiogenic or high-permeability variants is crucial to its proper early management. Our understanding of the disease processes producing noncardiogenic pulmonary edema has greatly expanded in the last 2 decades. Upper airway obstruction (UAO) is one of many recently recognized mechanisms which can produce noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. The UAO may be subtle in some patients, making its association with the subsequent pulmonary edema difficult especially for the physician unaware of this entity and the potential risk factors contributing to it. A high index of suspicion for this diagnosis is required in the right clinical settings. Our clinical results support a noncardiogenic basis for pulmonary edema occurring after UAO. Five of our 7 patients had at least 1 identifiable risk factor for the development of peri-intubation UAO and pulmonary edema. Additionally, the onset of pulmonary edema following UAO and the duration of the pulmonary edema varied considerably in our patients. Individuals with additional risk factors for the development of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema developed a more severe form of pulmonary edema associated with other organ-system disease. However, in most individuals, UAO-associated pulmonary edema appears to be a self-limited reversible process once it is recognized and properly treated.\r"

Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder, rare in outbred populations; carriers of the ataxia-telangiectasia gene may be as common as 1 in 60 and have subclinical radiosensitivity and cancer susceptibility. One estimate suggests that 8.8% of patients with breast cancer could be carriers of ataxia-telangiectasia. These carriers may be responsible for underestimating normal tolerance doses for radiation therapy by 15% to 20%; thus by preselecting and excluding carriers of ataxia-telangiectasia from cohorts of patients with cancer, conventional radiation doses might be increased so as to improve greatly the efficacy of radiotherapy. The genes for the 3 most common ataxia-telangiectasia complementation groups, which include 97% of tested families, have recently been localized to the long arm of chromosome 11.\r"

  ".U": "91172258\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated interstitial pneumonia is a major cause of death after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We conducted a controlled trial of ganciclovir in recipients of bone marrow transplants who had asymptomatic pulmonary CMV infection. We also sought to identify risk factors for the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia. METHODS. After bone marrow transplantation, 104 patients who had no evidence of respiratory disease underwent routine bronchoalveolar lavage on day 35. The 40 patients who had positive cultures for CMV were randomly assigned to either prophylactic ganciclovir or observation alone. Ganciclovir (5 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) was given twice daily for two weeks and then five times per week until day 120. RESULTS. Of the 20 culture-positive patients who received prophylactic ganciclovir, 5 (25 percent) died or had CMV pneumonia before day 120, as compared with 14 of the 20 culture-positive control patients (70 percent) who were not treated prophylactically (relative risk, 0.36; P = 0.01). No patient who received the full course of ganciclovir prophylaxis went on to have CMV interstitial pneumonia. Four patients treated with ganciclovir had maximal serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to 221 mumol per liter (2.5 mg per deciliter), as compared with none of the controls (P = 0.029). Of the 55 CMV-negative patients who could be evaluated, 12 (22 percent) had CMV pneumonia--a significantly lower rate than in the untreated CMV-positive control patients (relative risk, 0.33; P = 0.003). The strongest predictors of CMV pneumonia were a lavage-fluid culture that was positive for CMV and a CMV-positive blood culture, both from specimens obtained on day 35. CONCLUSION. In recipients of allogeneic bone marrow, asymptomatic CMV infection of the lung is a major risk factor for subsequent CMV interstitial pneumonia. Prophylactic ganciclovir is effective in preventing the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia in patients with asymptomatic infection.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. There is no specific method of diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea. Therefore, the frequency and clinical importance of diarrhea caused by magnesium are unknown. The purposes of this study were to establish a method for diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea and to apply it to patients with chronic diarrhea. METHODS. We measured fecal output of soluble magnesium and fecal magnesium concentration in 19 normal subjects with formed stools (15 collection periods), with non-magnesium-induced diarrhea (36 collection periods), and with diarrhea induced by magnesium hydroxide alone (11 collection periods) or in combination with phenolphthalein (3 collection periods), and in 359 patients with chronic diarrhea. RESULTS. The upper limits of fecal output of soluble magnesium and fecal magnesium concentration in normal subjects were 14.6 mmol per day and 45.2 mmol per liter, respectively. When normal subjects had diarrhea due to the ingestion of magnesium hydroxide alone or in combination with phenolphthalein, fecal magnesium output was always abnormally high. For each millimole increase in fecal magnesium output, fecal weight increased by approximately 7.3 g. The fecal magnesium concentration was very high when magnesium was the only cause of diarrhea but only moderately elevated when diarrhea was induced by magnesium hydroxide plus phenolphthalein. Biochemical and clinical evidence indicated that excessive ingestion of magnesium was an important cause of chronic diarrhea in 15 of the 359 patients with chronic diarrhea (4.2 percent), if not the only cause. CONCLUSIONS. Quantitative fecal analysis for soluble magnesium is an accurate method of diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea. Some patients with chronic diarrhea ingest excessive amounts of magnesium (in antacids or food supplements), and physicians may fail to discover this before embarking on an expensive and invasive diagnostic evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Invasive candidiasis is a major nosocomial infection that is difficult to diagnose. Few biochemically defined markers of invasive candidiasis are known. Initial findings suggested that the presence of candida enolase in the blood may be a novel marker for invasive candidiasis. METHODS. We tested 170 patients at high risk for invasive candidiasis for candida enolase antigenemia. All the patients had cancer and neutropenia. We detected antigen using a double-sandwich liposomal immunoassay for candida enolase in serially collected serum samples. Invasive candidiasis was proved by finding candida species in deep nonmucosal tissue, blood cultures, or both. Antigen testing was performed with the investigator blinded to tissue or culture diagnosis. RESULTS. Among 24 patients with proved invasive candidiasis, 149 serum samples were tested for enolase antigenemia; 80 were positive and 69 negative (sensitivity per sample, 54 percent). Multiple sampling improved the detection of antigenemia, which was found in 11 of 13 proved cases of deep tissue infection (85 percent) and in 7 of 11 proved cases of fungemia (64 percent). Specificity was 96 percent as measured against control groups including patients with mucosal colonization, bacteremia, and other deep mycoses. Antigenemia was detected in the absence of fungemia in 5 cases of deep tissue candidiasis, but was not detected in 6 cases of fungemia alone. CONCLUSIONS. Candida enolase antigenemia is a novel marker for invasive candidiasis. It may be a useful indicator of deep infection in patients with cancer and neutropenia and may complement the diagnostic usefulness of blood cultures.\r"

  ".U": "91172262\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although receiving a cadaveric kidney matched at the HLA-A, B, and DR loci enhances graft survival in cyclosporine-treated patients, the value of a national system of kidney allocation based on HLA matching, with the attendant increased likelihood of better matching, is still questioned. Some fear that the costs of a national system are unjustified when only a small fraction of donors would exactly match any of the 16,000 potential recipients anyway. We estimated the effect on graft survival of the use of HLA matching for all allocations of cadaveric kidneys in the United States. METHODS. The graft-survival rates in five mutually exclusive groups of transplants with increasing numbers of HLA mismatches were estimated by partitioning the data for 22,190 first-time recipients of cadaveric kidneys. Overall graft survival was projected as a weighted average with use of the percentages of transplants in the hierarchical groups in recipient waiting pools of various sizes. We compared the benefits and costs of HLA matching in a national system with those of introducing cyclosporine, which was projected to enhance graft survival by 7 percentage points at 10 years. RESULTS. Sharing kidneys nationally on the basis of hierarchical HLA matching was estimated to enhance graft survival by an additional 5 percentage points at 10 years. The anticipated five-year cost of national allocation of kidneys by HLA matching for 7000 recipients, including consideration of the costs of graft removal and dialysis after transplant rejection, would be +4F6.5 million less than the cost of using cyclosporine alone. CONCLUSIONS. The use of an HLA allocation system will not add to the cost of renal transplantation, but it will improve the long-term results to the same extent as cyclosporine. We propose the initiation of a national kidney-sharing system based on hierarchical levels of HLA matches.\r"

  ".U": "91172263\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. A key strategy used to contain hospital costs during the 1980s was to reduce the total number of admissions and average lengths of stay. We assessed the magnitude of the savings achieved, the effect of the reductions on the rate of increase in costs, and the prospects for future savings through reductions in the number of days patients spend in the hospital (inpatient days). METHODS. Using data from the American Hospital Association and the Health Care Financing Administration, we calculated the savings in the total number of inpatient days as the deviation from the historical increase in the number of inpatient days per year. We then estimated the real increase in costs that would have been observed if the reduction in the number of inpatient days had not occurred; we defined this value as the \"underlying\" rate of increase in costs. Finally, we compared the rates of increase in hospital reimbursement for Medicare beneficiaries and patients not covered by Medicare (non-Medicare patients). RESULTS. The total number of inpatient days per year decreased by 28 percent, in aggregate, between 1981 and 1988. The annual reduction was greatest in 1984 and 1985 and became progressively smaller in each subsequent year; by 1988 there was virtually no further reduction in the total number of inpatient days. The brief slowing of the increase in costs in the mid-1980s can be attributed entirely to the reduction in the number of inpatient days per year. The underlying rate of increase in costs was thus unaffected by efforts to contain spending. An increased number of outpatient visits partially offset the savings that resulted from the reduction in the number of inpatient days. This increase persisted even when the savings due to the lower number of inpatient days dwindled, and it virtually eliminated any dollar savings during the latter part of the 1980s. Between 1976 and 1982, Medicare spending on services provided by acute care hospitals rose by 9.2 percent per year in real terms, whereas non-Medicare expenditures rose by only 4.6 percent. This pattern has been reversed in recent years; in 1987-1988, Medicare spending rose by only 0.6 percent per year, whereas non-Medicare spending rose by 9 percent. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings suggest that the era of easy reductions in the number of inpatient days, with the associated attenuation of rising costs, is largely over. If further reductions in inpatient days are accompanied by an increase in the amount of ambulatory care similar to that during the past few years, the net savings will probably be negligible. Once the potential savings due to reductions in the number of inappropriate inpatient days has been exhausted, real hospital costs can be expected to rise, unless other effective measures to contain costs are implemented.\r"

To assess which interpretation is the more realistic, the simple reaction catalysed by triosephosphate isomerase is considered here. This examination illustrates some of the catalytic features of enzymes that are understood, and exposes a few that are not. But overall, the question turns out to have an optimistic answer.\r"

It has been proposed that in organisms whose plastids are surrounded by more than two membranes, the endosymbiont was a eukaryotic alga rather than a photosynthetic prokaryote. The DNA-containing nucleomorph of cryptomonad algae appears to be the vestigial nucleus of such an algal endosymbiont. Eukaryotic-type ribosomal RNA sequences have been localized to a nucleolus-like structure in the nucleomorph. In support of the hypothesis that cryptomonads are evolutionary chimaeras of two distinct eukaryotic cells, we show here that Cryptomonas phi contains two phylogenetically separate, nuclear-type small-subunit rRNA genes, both of which are transcriptionally active. We incorporate our rRNA sequence data into phylogenetic trees, from which we infer the evolutionary ancestry of the host and symbiont components of Cryptomonas phi. Such trees do not support the thesis that chromophyte algae evolved directly from a cryptomonad-like ancestor.\r"

The esterases are attributed to closely linked loci named A and B according to substrate preference, and overproduction of all esterases B is due to gene amplification. Distribution of electrophoretically distinct variants of overproduced esterases A and B is geographically restricted, with the exception of esterases A2 and B2, always found together throughout at least three continents. To determine whether this situation is due to migration or to a high mutation rate, esterase B structural genes and their flanking regions were compared by sequence and/or restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Whereas structural genes were similar, flanking regions of electrophoretically dissimilar esterases B varied considerably. In contrast, flanking sequences of esterases B2 from different geographical locations (Africa, Asia, North America) were identical. These results suggest that amplified esterase B2 genes originated from an initial event that has subsequently spread organophosphate insecticide resistance by migration.\r"

The calcium hypothesis proposes that membrane depolarization is necessary only for opening calcium channels and increasing internal calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) near membrane transmitter-release sites. These calcium ions trigger a transient release of neurotransmitter. The calcium-voltage hypothesis postulates that voltage induces a conformational change in a membrane protein rendering it sensitive to calcium such that, in the presence of high [Ca2+]i, depolarization directly triggers transmitter release. Here we report that when calcium influx is blocked by cobalt or manganese ions in a calcium-free Ringer, as measured with Fura-2, and [Ca2+]i is elevated by liberation from a caged calcium compound, transmitter release at the crayfish neuromuscular junction is unaffected by presynaptic action potentials. These results support the calcium hypothesis.\r"

Electrically induced changes in the shape of mammalian outer hair cells, studied in vitro, are commonly assumed to represent an aspect of their effector process that may occur in vivo. The nature of the motile process is obscure, even though none of the established cellular motors can be involved. Although it is known that the motile response is under voltage control, it is uncertain whether the stimulus is a drop in the voltage along the long axis of the cell or variation in the transmembrane potential. We have now performed experiments with cells partitioned in differing degrees between two chambers. Applied voltage stimulates the cell membrane segments in opposite polarity to an amount dependent on the partitioning. The findings show, in accordance with previous suggestions, that the driving stimulus is a local transmembrane voltage drop and that the cellular motor consists of many independent elements, distributed along the cell membrane and its associated cortical structures. We further show that the primary action of the motor elements is along the longitudinal dimension of the cell without necessarily involving changes in intracellular hydrostatic pressure. This establishes the outer hair cell motor as unique among mechanisms that control cell shape.\r"

NGF binds to specific cell-surface receptors but the mechanism for transduction of the neurotrophic signal is unknown. Several experiments using the NGF-responsive pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, have implicated tyrosine phosphorylation in NGF-mediated responses, although no NGF-specific tyrosine kinases have been identified. Here we show that NGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity of the trk proto-oncogene product, a tyrosine kinase receptor whose expression is restricted in vivo to neurons of the sensory spinal and cranial ganglia of neural crest origin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of trk by NGF is rapid, specific and occurs with picomolar quantities of factor, indicating that the response is mediated by physiological amounts of NGF. Activation of the trk tyrosine kinase receptor provides a possible mechanism for signal transduction by NGF.\r"

  ".W": "Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.\r"

Two families of heat-shock proteins, hsp60s and hsp70s, have been implicated in accelerating protein folding and oligomerization and also in maintaining proteins in an unfolded state, thus facilitating membrane transport. The Escherichia coli hsp70 analogue, DnaK, and two other heat-shock proteins, DnaJ and GrpE, are required for cell viability at high temperatures and are involved in DNA replication of phage lambda and plasmids P1 and F. These three proteins are involved in replication in vitro of P1 DNA along with many host replication proteins and the P1 RepA initiator protein. RepA exists in a stable protein complex with DnaJ containing a dimer each of RepA and DnaJ. We report here that DnaK and DnaJ mediate an alteration in the P1 initiator protein, rendering it much more active for oriP1 DNA binding.\r"

Porin channels have been shown in vitro to be voltage-gated. They can exhibit slight selectivities for certain solutes; for example PhoE porin has some selectivity for anionic and phosphate-containing compounds. Unlike many known membrane proteins which often contain long stretches of hydrophobic segments that are believed to traverse the membrane in a helical conformation, porins are found to have charged residues distributed almost uniformly along their primary sequences and have most of their secondary structure in a beta-sheet conformation. We have made crystalline patches of PhoE porin embedded in a lipid bilayer and have used these to determine the structure of PhoE porin by electron crystallography to a resolution of 6A. The basic structure consists of a trimer of elliptically shaped, cylindrical walls of beta sheet. Each cylinder has an inner lining, formed by parts of the polypeptide, that defines the channel size. The structure provides a clue as to how deletions of segments of polypeptide, which are found in certain mutants, can result in an actual increase in the channel size.\r"

Two regulator proteins, FixL and FixJ, initiate the oxygen-response cascade, and the genes that encode them have been cloned. The fixL product seems to be a transmembrane sensor that modulates the activity of the fixJ product, a cytoplasmic regulator. FixL and FixJ are homologous to a family of bacterial two-component regulators, for which the mode of signal transduction is phosphorylation. We report here the purification of both FixJ and a soluble truncated FixL (FixL*), overproduced from a single plasmid construct. FixL* catalyses its own phosphorylation and the transfer of the gamma-phosphate of ATP to Fix J. The resulting FixJ-phosphate linkage is sensitive to base, as are the aspartyl phosphates of homologous systems. Visible spectra of purified FixL* show that it is an oxygen-binding haemoprotein. We propose that FixL senses oxygen through its haem moiety and transduces this signal by controlling the phosphorylation of FixJ.\r"

  ".W": "Physical mapping of chromosomes would be facilitated by methods of breaking large DNA into manageable fragments, or cutting uniquely at genetic markers of interest. Key issues in the design of sequence-specific DNA cleaving reagents are the specificity of binding, the generalizability of the recognition motif, and the cleavage yield. Oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation is a generalizable motif for specific binding to sequences longer than 12 base pairs within DNA of high complexity. Studies with plasmid DNA show that triple helix formation can limit the operational specificity of restriction enzymes to endonuclease recognition sequences that overlap oligonucleotide-binding sites. Triple helix formation, followed by methylase protection, triple helix-disruption, and restriction endonuclease digestion produces near quantitative cleavage at the single overlapping triple helix-endonuclease site. As a demonstration that this technique may be applicable to the orchestrated cleavage of large genomic DNA, we report the near quantitative single-site enzymatic cleavage of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome mediated by triple helix formation. The 340-kilobase yeast chromosome III was cut uniquely at an overlapping homopurine-EcoRI target site 27 base pairs long to produce two expected cleavage products of 110 and 230 kilobases. No cleavage of any other chromosome was detected. The potential generalizability of this technique, which is capable of near quantitative cleavage at a single site in at least 14 megabase pairs of DNA, could enable selected regions of chromosomal DNA to be isolated without extensive screening of genomic libraries.\r"

NGF, BDNF and NT-3 all support survival of subpopulations of neural crest-derived sensory neurons; most sympathetic neurons are responsive to NGF, but not to BDNF; NT-3 and BDNF, but not NGF, promote survival of sensory neurons of the nodose ganglion. BDNF, but not NGF, supports the survival of cultured retinal ganglion cells but both NGF and BDNF promote the survival of septal cholinergic neurons in vitro. However, knowledge of their precise physiological role in development and maintenance of the nervous system neurons is still limited. The BDNF gene is expressed in many regions of the adult CNS, including the striatum. A protein partially purified from bovine striatum, a target of nigral dopaminergic neurons, with characteristics apparently similar to those of BDNF, can enhance the survival of dopaminergic neurons in mesencephalic cultures. BDNF seems to be a trophic factor for mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, increasing their survival, including that of neuronal cells which degenerate in Parkinson's disease. Here we report the effects of BDNF on the survival of dopaminergic neurons of the developing substantia nigra.\r"

The stoichiometry of each subunit in the functional receptor has been difficult to assess, however. Estimates of the molecular weight of neuronal nicotonic receptor macromolecules suggest that these receptors contain at least four subunits but probably not more than five. We have examined the subunit stoichiometry of the chick neuronal alpha 4/n alpha 1 receptor by first using site-directed mutagenesis to create subunits that confer different single channel properties on the receptor. Co-injection with wild-type and mutant subunits led to the appearance of receptors with wild-type, mutant and hybrid conductances. From the number of hybrid conductances, we could deduce the number of each subunit in the functional receptor.\r"

The phenotype is manifested in all cell layers of the leaf blade, but is controlled by a subgroup of cells of the inner layer. Mutations result from the insertion of transposable elements or a tandem duplication. We show that the Kn1 gene encodes a homeodomain-containing protein, the first identified in the plant kingdom. Sequence comparisons strongly suggest that Kn1 acts as a transcription factor. Here we use the Kn1 homeobox to isolate other expressed homeobox genes in maize. The Kn1 homeobox may permit the isolation of genes that, like animal and fungal counterparts, regulate cell fate determination.\r"

Although null alleles are valuable, changes at the nucleotide level of a gene are very important for functional analysis. One gene family in which subtle mutations would be particularly valuable are the clusters of Hox homeobox genes. Inactivation of gene in a cluster with a neo cassette that includes promoter/enhancer elements may deregulate transcription of neighbouring genes and generate a phenotype which is difficult to interpret. We describe here a highly efficient gene targeting method, termed the 'hit and run' procedure. This generates ES cells with subtle site-specific mutations with no selectable marker and may be useful for most genes. We have developed this procedure at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) locus and subsequently isolated ES cells with a premature stop codon in the homeobox of Hox-2.6 (ref. 14).\r"

Expression occurs near the G1/S phase boundary and the genes seem to be coordinately regulated (reviewed in ref. 4). The upstream promoter sequences of these genes have only a hexamer element, ACGCGT (an MluI restriction site), in common. Here we show that this hexamer is able to impart periodic expression to a heterologous gene and, significantly, this expression occurs coincidentally with that of CDC9, one of the DNA synthesis genes (Table 1). We have also identified a protein that binds specifically to these sequences in a similar periodic manner. These ACGCGT sequences and the transcription factor that binds to them therefore seem to be the elements controlling both the periodic expression and coordinate regulation of the DNA synthesis genes.\r"

Struhl questioned the conclusion that we had identified new transcriptional activating sequences that function in the absence of yeast transcriptional activating sequences. His criticism was based on two considerations: first, GAL4(1-147) contains an acidic segment (and subsequent experiments have shown that this region contains a weak activating region in vitro); second, attempts to isolate new activating regions failed when the DNA-binding domain of a bacterial repressor, LexA(1-87), was used as the DNA-binding unit. We report here a repeat of our original experiment using the complete LexA molecule LexA(1-202) as the DNA-binding region, instead of GAL4(1-147) or LexA(1-87). We find that, as in the original experiment, about 1% of the short peptides encoded by E. coli genomic fragments act as transcriptional activating regions when fused to intact LexA. All of the new activating regions whose sequences we determined bore an excess of acidic amino acids (see Table 1).\r"

  ".W": "Erythropoiesis during human development is characterized by switches in expression of beta-like globin genes during the transition from the embryonic through fetal to adult stages. Activation and high-level expression of the genes is directed by the locus control region (LCR), located 5' to the epsilon gene. The location of the LCR and its role in directing high-level expression of the globin genes has led to the suggestion that competition from the beta gene for interaction with the LCR has a major role in silencing the fetal gamma genes during adult life. We have now constructed lines of transgenic mice containing the human A gamma globin gene linked to the LCR. We observe high-level expression of the transgene in the embryonic stages but silencing of the gene in adult animals. We conclude that the gamma gene is not deregulated by the presence of the LCR and that competition from the beta gene is not required for silencing of the gamma genes in adult life. The silencing is therefore likely to be mediated by stage-specific factors binding to sequences immediately flanking the genes.\r"

These were applied as part of a blinded, large-scale, multipopulation, multiplex PCR-based study designed to examine this issue of association. Our results do not support the hypothesis that HTLV-I, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of an encephalomyeloneuropathy, HTLV-II, or closely related agents are associated with MS.

HSP72, which was present at very low levels in control brains, increased dramatically in AD patients, and was localized exclusively in neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. We hypothesize that HSP72 is induced as an early response to the formation of abnormal proteins, perhaps targeting them for proteolysis. In contrast, GRP78 increased in AD only in neurons that remained cytologically normal, especially in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus and the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex. The increased expression of GRP78 within successfully surviving neurons suggests that this protein may protect such cells from AD-specific damage.\r"

We determined antibody reactivity by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified glycolipids and glycoproteins as antigens, and we used high-performance thin-layer chromatography and Western blotting to test the specificity of results. Twelve patients with high titers of IgM antibodies directed against the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) had sensory-motor polyneuropathies with physiologic evidence of demyelination. IgM antibody reactivity to MAG was associated with an IgM serum M protein in five patients. Eight other patients, most with sensory greater than motor polyneuropathies, had high titers of antibody reactivity to sulfatide but not of IgM to MAG. Two had an associated IgM paraprotein. None of the patients with selective serum antisulfatide activity had predominantly demyelinating features on physiologic testing. We conclude that (1) high ELISA titers of antibodies to MAG may be more common than previously suspected in patients with chronic demyelinating sensory-motor neuropathies, and (2) the presence of high titers of antisulfatide antibodies in serum may provide clues to the pathogenesis of otherwise idiopathic, axonal, predominantly sensory neuropathies.\r"

Performance deteriorated in five of the six visuospatial measures, as a function of disease duration. However, the pattern of visuospatial decline depended on whether dementia was present. The results were not influenced by age or anticholinergic medication. These findings support the presence of visuospatial deficits in PD patients, with a changing pattern of impairment related to dementia and progression of the disease.\r"

Forty-one of 1,418 (2.8%) patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures during treatment with clozapine. Life-table analysis predicts a cumulative 10% risk of seizures after 3.8 years of treatment. Clozapine-related seizures appear to be dose-related. High-dose therapy (greater than or equal to 600 mg/day) was associated with a greater risk of seizures (4.4%) than medium (300 to 600 mg/day; 2.7%) or low doses (less than 300 mg/day; 1.0%). Also, rapid upward titration may increase seizure risk. Thirty-one of 41 patients were successfully continued on clozapine despite seizure occurrence, either with reduction of dose or addition of an antiepileptic medication. Recognition and treatment of clozapine-related seizures will become increasingly important as its use grows in the 1990s.\r"

Thus, a total of six of 15 family members at risk for the disease (including the three established cases) had the same codon 102 mutation, a proportion consistent with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of disease expression.

One hundred twenty-five consecutive newly diagnosed patients with PD started levodopa treatment at the time diagnosis and were followed for 2 to 10 years. During follow-up, 60 patients had wearing-off or early morning akinesia. We estimated the cumulative time-dependent risk of motor fluctuation occurrence through a multivariable analysis. The risk was lower for patients with tremor-predominant PD, for those with shorter disease duration prior to levodopa, and for those who were relatively older at levodopa initiation. Our results suggest that, as far as motor fluctuations are concerned, disease prognosis is not influenced by early levodopa treatment. These observation support the introduction of levodopa as soon as there is a subjective need for the patients to maintain their level of social and work performance.\r"

We determined GPI kinetically using a coupled enzyme reaction assay. There were 31 males and 35 females, aged 1 to seventy-six. Thirty-one had primary brain tumors, and 35 had systemic cancer with suspected CNS metastasis. We analyzed 95 samples; GPI values ranged from 0.85 to 329.0 U/l (normal, less than 20 U/l). Compared with positive CSF cytology and myelography, GPI sensitivity was 53.5% and specificity 92.1% for the group as a whole. There was a highly significant association between elevated CSF GPI (greater than 20 U/l) and LM. The results were similar for both primary CNS and systemic malignancies. Although not very sensitive, an elevated CSF GPI strongly suggests LM and may aid in early diagnosis of this serious complication of cancer.\r"

Improvement on the Kurtzke Disability Status Scale by one or more steps post-therapy and at 3-year follow-up is significant by comparison with pre-PE disability status. Clinical improvement was maintained in the majority of patients, reaching as far as a 6-year follow-up. Major life-threatening complications attributable to this combined therapy were not observed.\r"

The noteworthy findings were a small brain with mild cerebral atrophy but normal gyral development. There was marked cerebellar atrophy with loss of Purkinje and granule cells and extensive Bergmann's gliosis. Study of dendrite morphology using Golgi impregnations of the visual cortex revealed a prominent decrease in dendritic arborization of layer 3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Quantitative Golgi analysis also revealed a significant decrease in the numbers of dendritic spines in apical layer 3 dendrites and both apical and basal layer 5 dendrites. Neurochemical studies of frozen brain tissue demonstrated markedly reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid content in the cerebellar cortex, as well as elevated glutamate content in the frontal and occipital cortices. Although there are no definite morphologic correlates of many of the clinical signs, the pronounced dendritic pathology and neurochemical abnormalities in cerebral cortex may provide a physiologic basis for mental retardation.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin has recently been shown experimentally to modify ischemic brain damage when administered either before or after the episode of ischemia. In controlled studies in the rat, high doses of insulin (greater than or equal to 8 IU/kg) result in seizures and early death. The present study was undertaken to determine whether diazepam, a potent, centrally penetrating GABAmimetic, alone or in combination with insulin, could mitigate postischemic seizures or regional selective neuronal necrosis and infarction. Forebrain ischemia was induced in rats for 10 1/2 minutes by carotid clamping and hypotension. The animals were observed clinically until elective perfusion-fixation and quantitative pathologic examination at 1-week recovery. Diazepam, either alone or with insulin, reduced regional brain necrosis and reduced the seizure rate. Insulin alone also led to reduced regional necrosis. However, the combination of diazepam plus insulin yielded the greatest proportion of undamaged brains in the hippocampus, thalamus, and midbrain. In the neocortex, the diazepam-only group showed the greatest number of normal hemispheres. Hypothalamic infarction was eliminated by all three treatments. Seizures per se were associated with increased damage in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, irrespective of treatment group. The findings indicate that ischemic brain necrosis can be mitigated by diazepam and insulin treatment begun in the immediate postischemic period.\r"

Rather they were identified as strains of HSV type 1 (HSV-1) on the basis of plaque morphology, neutralization tests, electron-microscopic examination and DNA restriction endonuclease analysis.

We found that glial cells are commonly and characteristically found in elevated diabetic proliferations and present at the vitreous surface. The newly formed blood vessels, however, were not seen at the edge of elevated epiretinal and preretinal membranes in early and intermediate stages. These results suggest that glial cells may extend beyond the vascularized areas of the proliferative tissue. It is possible that glial cells and their extracellular matrix contribute to the framework leading to the development of new blood vessels.\r"

  ".W": "Disturbances of the lipid composition can, like mucin or fluid deficiency, cause 'dry eye'. The substitution of the lipids of the tear fluid has previously been unsatisfactory since eye ointments containing fats can lead to a considerable deterioration of the visual acuity due to the film of ointment resulting from an irregular spreading behavior. We proposed the introduction of physiological lipids that are normally present in tear fluid, such as phospholipids, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and triglycerides, to provide lipid-containing eye drops. These best correspond to 'natural tears' and, due to the small size of the lipid particles, avoid a disturbance of the spreading behavior of the lipid layer. With lipid-containing eye drops of this kind, we carried out the following examinations: inquiry of patients' symptoms based on a standardized interview; Schirmer test under local anesthesia; break-up time (BUT); biomicroscopic evaluation of the lipid film, and stability tests as pH, gas chromatographic analysis of the fatty acid pattern and thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the lipid pattern. Schirmer test, BUT measurement and questioning about symptoms were undertaken after 1 week and then again after 3 weeks of treatment. All three parameters finally showed an improvement with a high statistical significance (p less than 0.001). The stability tests have shown that pH, lipid particle size, fatty acid and lipid composition of the examined lipid-containing eye drops were nearly unchanged till 4 months after preparation.\r"

  ".U": "91172566\r", 
  ".W": "The understanding of the molecular biology of human cancer has advanced rapidly in the last decade, in part due to discoveries in the rare, pediatric ocular tumor, retinoblastoma. RB studies have led to recognition of a class of human genes, the tumor suppressor genes, that are critical in the initiation and progression of the malignant process. Mutations in the RB1 gene initiate RB and other specific tumors. They may also contribute to progressive stages of many other malignancies. The protein product of RB1 (p110RB1) is a basic regulator of the cell cycle. In the absence of normal protein, the cell proceeds to the next cell division without the potential to become quiescent. Understanding the genetics of RB has benefited the patients, as the precise identification of the RB1 mutations in families has led to accurate prediction of individuals at risk for RB tumors. It seems unlikely, in the foreseeable future, that direct genetic manipulation of mutant RB1 genes will play a role in therapy, but complete understanding of the function of p110RB1 may eventually allow exploitation of its powerful antiproliferative effect. Other molecular genetic events in addition to RB1 mutations are documented in RB tumors, and may play a critical role in the full malignant phenotype. The oncogene, N-myc, is amplified in some RB tumors and is expressed in normal fetal retina. The cytogenetic abnormality, i(6p), is almost unique to RB tumors. The molecular and tissue-specific roles of these abnormalities are not yet known. Many RB tumors also acquire excessive expression of the cell surface membrane glycoprotein, p170, linked to multidrug resistance, whether or not the RB tumor has been exposed to chemotherapy. We anticipate that ways to avoid or counteract the drug resistance of excessive p170 expression will be developed for other pediatric tumors and eventually will be applied to chemotherapy for RB patients.\r"

The first effective therapy became available in the early 1970s, and although controversy existed for several years regarding the relative value of aggressive multiagent chemotherapy, presently about 60% of patients with resectable primary tumors and no metastases at diagnosis will be cured. New imaging methods, including computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and radionuclide techniques, that are sensitive to changes in local tumor perfusion have improved the ability to define the extent of tumor and the response to chemotherapy, and to plan surgery. Although amputation historically has been the primary method for local tumor control, newer surgical techniques and endoprosthetic devices, coupled with effective preoperative chemotherapy, have offered less radical surgery for 50% to 80% of patients with osteosarcoma. New therapeutic agents, including ifosfamide and the immunosuppressive drug, muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine, hold promise for improvement in the cure rate of osteosarcoma.\r"

  ".W": "Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) allows delivery of intensive, marrow-ablative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy to children with high-risk solid tumors. Results from several studies of neuroblastoma suggest that outcome is improved by ABMT; however, relapses can occur months to years after complete clinical remission. Other high-risk tumors including peripheral neuroepithelioma, Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms' tumor, and brain tumors also appear to be responsive to intensive marrow-ablative therapy, although few studies have been reported. For tumors that can metastasize to marrow, a sensitive method is necessary for detecting tumor cell contamination. Immunocytologic analysis with monoclonal antibodies can identify one neuroblastoma cell per 10(5) normal marrow cells; this method also is applicable to other tumors with appropriate antibodies. Ex vivo removal (purging) of tumor cells decreases the probability of infusing tumorigenic cells with the ABMT. There is considerable experience in tumor detection and purging for neuroblastoma, but little has been done for other childhood solid tumors. Future investigations of ABMT will aim to further increase disease-free survival by intensifying induction and marrow-ablative regimens and by developing therapies to be given after ABMT that are directed at minimal residual disease. As pilot investigations mature, the efficacy of ABMT and conventional chemotherapy will be compared in multi-institution randomized studies.\r"

By virtue of its tumor specificity, the use of immunotherapy at the time when microscopic residual disease is present holds great promise in eradicating the tumors permanently. Monoclonal antibodies can accumulate selectively and at high concentrations in neuroblastomas. They have the potential of initiating complement activation and inflammation at the tumor site. Hematopoietic factors and cytokines can reinforce the body with tumoricidal leukocytes. Ex vivo activation of autologous white cells as well as arming by genetic manipulation can also produce tumor-seeking vehicles that may be therapeutically useful. As the knowledge of tumor and host immunobiology accumulates, the optimal combination of these approaches will become apparent.\r"

  ".W": "Age of a patient when afflicted with Hodgkin's disease is an important prognostic factor. Although there are histologic and stage differences as a function of age, the younger a patient is when diagnosed, the better the cure rate. Youngsters less than age 10 years have a freedom from relapse of 80% at 26 years follow-up examination; adolescents in the 11 to 16 age group have a freedom from relapse or 74%; and adults aged 17 years or older have a freedom from relapse of 64%. These differences translate into significant survival differences as well, with children aged 10 years or younger and those aged 11 to 16 years having a 26-year survival of 74%, as compared to adults, who have a 37% survival (P = 0.003). These differences remain significant when comparing those with stage I and II disease, as opposed to those with advanced stage III and IV disease. Children present the greatest challenges with respect to staging and treatment. The older child with localized disease can be managed appropriately as an adult. However, for the younger child the use of low-dose radiation and multiagent chemotherapy is widely accepted. Using this approach, survival rates of 85% or greater are reported from many large institutional and cooperative group experiences. The goals of treatment today are cure of disease, with maximal quality of life and minimal complications from the treatment. The late effects of greatest importance to the youngest children are skeletal and bone growth abnormalities, sterility, and malignant tumor induction. Treatment programs today should be directed towards refining therapy to minimize sequelae while maximizing quality of life. These goals are best achieved when children are managed in regional centers with demonstrated expertise in the management of children with Hodgkin's disease. Whereas cure can be achieved in a large majority of children diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, our challenge is cure, with the least sequelae and the greatest quality of life. \"Children are not simply micro-adults, but have their own specific problems.\"\r"

  ".W": "Binding of 13C-enriched oleic acid to bovine serum albumin and to three large proteolytic fragments of albumin--two complementary fragments corresponding to the two halves of albumin and one fragment corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal domain--yielded unique patterns of NMR resonances (chemical shifts and relative intensities) that were used to identify the locations of binding of the first 5 mol of oleic acid to the multidomain albumin molecule. The first 3 mol of oleic acid added to intact albumin generated three distinct NMR resonances as a result of simultaneous binding of oleic acid to three heterogeneous sites (primary sites). Two of these resonances were seen upon addition of 1 or 2 mol of oleic acid to fragments representing either the carboxyl-terminal half (residues 307-582) or the carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 377-582); the third resonance was seen upon addition of 1 mol of oleic acid to the fragment representing the amino-terminal half (residues 1-306). The resonance patterns for the fourth and fifth moles of oleic acid added to albumin (secondary sites) could not be duplicated by addition of more oleic acid to individual fragments. These resonance patterns were generated, however, when the two complementary fragments were mixed in equimolar proportions to form an albumin-like complex with a reconstituted middle domain. Thus, two primary fatty acid binding sites are assigned to the carboxyl-terminal domain, one primary site is assigned to the amino-terminal half, and the secondary sites are assigned to the middle domain. This distribution suggests albumin to be a less symmetrical binding molecule than theoretical models predict. This work also demonstrates the power of NMR for the study of microenvironments of individual fatty acid binding sites in specific domains.\r"

  ".W": "Covalent linkage of myristate (tetradecanoate; 14:0) to the NH2-terminal glycine residue of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) 55-kDa gag polyprotein precursor (Pr55gag) is necessary for its proteolytic processing and viral assembly. We have shown recently that several analogs of myristate in which a methylene group is replaced by a single oxygen or sulfur atom are substrates for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.97; NMT) despite their reduced hydrophobicity. Some inhibit HIV-1 replication in acutely infected CD4+H9 cells without accompanying cellular toxicity. To examine the mechanism of their antiviral effects, we performed labeling studies with two analogs, 12-methoxydodecanoate (13-oxamyristate; 13-OxaMyr) and 5-octyloxypentanoate (6-oxamyristate; 6-OxaMyr), the former being much more effective than the latter in blocking virus production. [3H]Myristate and [3H]13-OxaMyr were incorporated into Pr55gag with comparable efficiency when it was coexpressed with S. cerevisiae NMT in Escherichia coli. [3H]6-OxaMyr was not incorporated, even though its substrate properties in vitro were similar to those of 13-OxaMyr and myristate. [3H]13-OxaMyr, but not [3H]6-OxaMyr, was also efficiently incorporated into HIV-1 Pr55gag and nef (negative factor) in chronically infected H9 cells. Analog incorporation produced a redistribution of Pr55gag from membrane to cytosolic fractions and markedly decreased its proteolytic processing by viral protease. 13-OxaMyr and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) act synergistically to reduce virus production in acutely infected H9 cells. Unlike AZT, the analog is able to inhibit virus production (up to 70%) in chronically infected H9 cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effect lasts 6-8 days. These results suggest that (i) its mechanism of action is distinct from that of AZT and involves a late step in virus assembly; (ii) the analog may allow reduction in the dose of AZT required to affect viral replication; and (iii) combinations of analog and HIV-1 protease inhibitors may have synergistic effects on the processing of Pr55gag.\r"

We report the complete DNA sequence of a genomic clone of Adh1 from Pennisetum glaucum cv. Tift 23DB (pearl millet). The gene is characterized by ten exons and nine introns. The 5' flanking region of the gene contains sequences corresponding to the anaerobic regulatory element as well as sequences corresponding to the TATA box and the CAAT box identified in the maize Adh1-1S flanking regions. Exon sequences from Pennisetum and maize have been subjected to relative rate tests; the maize and Pennisetum Adh1 lineages evolve at equal rates. These results are compared with similar relative rate studies by using the chloroplast DNA encoding the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) gene. Evolutionary rates of Adh1 are estimated. Nonsynonymous rates are found to be 2.50 x 10(-10) substitutions per site per year, whereas synonymous rates are approximately 7.90 x 10(-9) substitutions per site per year. Molecular phylogenies of the Poaceae based upon Adh1 data are presented.\r"

The inbred FVB/N strain is characterized by vigorous reproductive performance and consistently large litters. Moreover, fertilized FVB/N eggs contain large and prominent pronuclei, which facilitate microinjection of DNA. The phenotype of large pronuclei in the zygote is a dominant trait associated with the FVB/N oocyte but not the FVB/N sperm. In experiments to generate transgenic mice, the same DNA constructs were injected into three different types of zygotes: FVB/N, C57BL/6J, and (C57BL/6J x SJL/J)F1. FVB/N zygotes survived well after injection, and transgenic animals were obtained with efficiencies similar to the F1 zygotes and much better than the C57BL/6J zygotes. Genetic markers of the FVB/N strain have been analyzed for 44 loci that cover 15 chromosomes and were compared with those of commonly used inbred strains. In addition to the albino FVB/N strain, pigmented congenic strains of FVB/N are being constructed. These features make the FVB/N strain advantageous to use for research with transgenic mice.\r"

We have now overexpressed the secretory protein beta 2-microglobulin in beta cells. Transgenic mice of one lineage had normal islets. Mice of another lineage did not become overtly diabetic but showed significant depletion of beta-cell insulin. When mice were made homozygous for the transgene locus, they developed diabetes. Introduction of the beta 2-microglobulin chain into class I heavy chain transgenic mice resulted in a significant improvement in their islet morphology and insulin content, and the female mice remained normoglycemic. These results suggest that different transgene molecules overexpressed in beta cells can cause islet dysfunction, though not necessarily overt diabetes, and that this effect is mediated by the level of transgene expression. Evidence is provided to show that beta-cell disruption by transgene overexpression occurs at the level of protein and involves a defect in insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "From a nucleus of Sprague-Dawley rats received in 1960 from the National Institutes of Health, we have raised, by brother-to-sister mating, a colony of these animals. The incidence of leukemia in 313 females and 316 males was 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively. About 3 years ago, we observed a relatively high incidence of leukemia in offspring of a healthy female, no. 1. Among the offspring of this female, observed through 12 successive generations, there were 17 leukemias among 44 females (38.6%) and 21 leukemias among 40 males (52.5%), developing at ages varying from 6 to 11.6 months. The most frequent form of leukemia observed was acute myeloid, with a high count of myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes; lymphatic form was relatively rare but was observed occasionally; pronounced anemia was common. In most instances, on autopsy, the pathological picture was that of an enlarged spleen and liver, with the exception of those few animals that developed lymphatic leukemia, with thymic and mesenteric lymphoid tumors. We have no satisfactory explanation for this sudden, unexpected conversion of a part of our Sprague-Dawley rat colony from low-leukemic to high-leukemic inbred line. As a working hypothesis, the possibility of a spontaneous activation of a hypothetical oncogenic virus should be considered. The high leukemic C58 inbred line of mice originated in a similar, unexplained manner [MacDowell, E.C. & Richter, M.N. (1935) Arch. Pathol. 20, 709-724]. However, leukemia developing in mice was subsequently found to be caused by a transmissible virus, whereas, thus far at least, no evidence of a transmissible virus has been found in leukemia developing spontaneously in rats.\r"

The NPY reduction appears to be mediated through a decrease in NPY biosynthesis, occurring transneuronally, perhaps in response to changes in synaptic dopamine associated with mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine neurons. The medial prefrontal cortex appears necessary for maintenance of cocaine's action on this neuronal network since excitotoxic lesions of this area prevented (lesion before cocaine) and reversed (lesion after cocaine) the reductions in NPY elicited by the cocaine. NPY may be a sensitive marker for chronic cocaine use. Its decrease may relate to the anxiety and depression associated with cocaine withdrawal in humans.\r"

Here we provide evidence that reducing the population of selected thalamic fibers projecting into the primary visual cortex (area 17) of monkeys during midgestation induces the formation of a novel cytoarchitectonic area situated along the border of and embedded within area 17. This region, termed area X, differs cytoarchitectonically from both area 17 and the adjacent secondary visual cortex (area 18). We propose that an aberrant combination of thalamic and cortical connections acting on a portion of prospective area 17 deprived of its normal thalamic input may result in formation of a hybrid cortex. Our results support the protomap hypothesis of cortical parcellation and suggest how during evolution new cytoarchitectonic regions may arise by cell-cell interactions that depend on a unique combination of intrinsic properties of cortical neurons and afferent fibers.\r"

In animals, a greater behavioral reactivity to a mild stress, such as exposure to a novel environment, is an index of the vulnerability to acquire amphetamine self-administration. Biological responses to stress as well as behavioral reactivity may predict such a vulnerability. In the present study, rats with a longer duration of corticosterone secretion after exposure to novelty showed facilitation of acquisition of amphetamine self-administration. Furthermore, corticosterone administration in nonpredisposed individuals increased the reinforcing value of the drug and facilitated the acquisition of amphetamine self-administration. These results indicate that the stress-related activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may play a role in the pathogenesis of psychostimulant addiction.\r"

This notion has been supported by the identification of polyribosomes and selected mRNAs in those compartments. In this study, we report the discovery of a specific RNA polymerase III transcript in dendrites. This RNA, a noncoding, 152-nucleotide-long, single-gene transcript known as BC1 RNA, is expressed almost exclusively in the nervous system. In adult rats as well as in immature rats in late developmental stages, BC1 RNA has been located in the dendrites and somata of a subset of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system. The colocalization of BC1 RNA with dendritic mRNAs and polyribosomes may indicate a role--possibly within the functional unit of a high molecular mass ribonucleoprotein particle--in specific pre- or posttranslational processes in postsynaptic compartments of neurons.\r"

The mass isotopomer patterns of 13C-labeled blood glucose and liver glycogen were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The contribution of the direct pathway to glycogen was calculated from the three tracers, and the values by all three were nearly identical, about 50%. The 14C specific activity in carbon 6 of glycogen glucose was about 6% that of carbon 1. The [3H]glucose/[1-14C]glucose ratio in glycogen was 80-90% that in blood glucose. The enrichment of 13C and the specific activity of 14C in glycogen formed by the indirect path were 20-25% of glycogen formed directly from glucose. The dilution is of two kinds: (i) an exchange of labeled carbon with unlabeled carbon in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and (ii) dilution by unlabeled nonglucose carbon. Methods to calculate the two types of dilution are presented. In control rats the dilution factor by exchange in the tricarboxylic acid cycle is 1.4, and the dilution by unlabeled carbon is 2.5- to 3.0-fold, with the overall dilution about 4-fold. In rats preinjected with glucagon, the dilution through the tricarboxylic acid cycle was unaffected but that by nonglucose carbon was decreased.\r"

  ".W": "Several polyadenylylation (PA) signals containing elements upstream of the AAUAAA have recently been characterized. Similar to PA elements found downstream of the AAUAAA, the upstream elements function to increase efficiency of AAUAAA use as a signal for cleavage and PA. Using deletion and linker scanning mutations we show that the PA signal of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 contains upstream elements transcribed from the U3 region of the 3' long terminal repeat. The element that has the greatest effect on PA site use lies 77 to 94 nucleotides upstream of the AAUAAA, between the TATA element and the transcriptional initiation site. Mutations in the adjacent region, between 59 and 76 nucleotides upstream of the AAUAAA, have a smaller effect on PA efficiency. Mutations in a region further upstream, between 141 and 176 nucleotides upstream of the AAUAAA, also affected PA modestly. Functional similarity between upstream elements was indicated by the ability of the human immunodeficiency virus upstream region to replace the upstream region of the simian virus 40 late PA signal. The sequence of the major upstream element of human immunodeficiency virus is uracil-rich, analogous to many defined downstream PA elements. This fact may imply that upstream and downstream elements have similar mechanisms of action.\r"

A fusion protein with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa was expressed from a pUC119 derivative of pAOSG81 (pAOSG81-119) in Escherichia coli cells and was recognized by the monoclonal antibodies. When the in vitro translated and immunoprecipitated products made from mRNA hybrid-selected by pAOSG81 were analyzed, a single band corresponding to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa was observed. DNA sequence characterization showed that pAOSG81 contains the entire coding region of a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 38.9 kDa, a putative 63-amino acid transit peptide, and a 9-amino acid match to the authentic N-terminal sequence of the 36-kDa alternative oxidase protein. Analyses of the deduced amino acid sequence indicate: (i) that the transit peptide is predicted to form amphiphilic helices, and (ii) that three regions of the processed protein are likely to form transmembrane alpha-helices. We conclude from these data that pAOSG81 represents a nuclear gene, aox1, encoding a precursor protein of one or more of the alternative oxidase proteins of S. guttatum.\r"

  ".U": "91172766\r", 
  ".W": "The skeletal alpha-actin gene is expressed in fetal rat heart and is induced during norepinephrine (NE)-stimulated hypertrophy in cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Here we report that NE positively regulates the human skeletal alpha-actin gene promoter in transiently transfected neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. NE increased expression from the full-length promoter by 2.4-fold. A DNA region required for NE responsiveness but not for tissue-specific expression was located between base pair -2000 and base pair -1300. Distinct regions required for cardiac myocyte expression were located between -1300 to -710 and -153 to -87. None of these elements separately conferred tissue specificity or adrenergic responsiveness on a heterologous promoter, although the intact promoter from -2000 to -36 conferred both when cloned in its correct position and orientation. Additional elements in the basal promoter (-87 to +187) were required for maximal NE responsiveness. The NE induction was mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor in high-density cultures (3-4 x 10(6) cells per 60-mm dish), as was induction of hypertrophy, contractility, and endogenous skeletal alpha-actin gene expression. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol was as potent as NE in inducing expression. Furthermore, beta-adrenergic antagonists inhibited the effects on skeletal alpha-actin gene expression but alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists did not. The alpha 1-adrenergic system was intact in these high-density cultures, since the effects of NE on the expression of another contractile protein gene, alpha-myosin heavy chain, were blocked by alpha 1- but not by beta-adrenergic antagonists. In these high-density cultures, cell contact and intermyocardiocyte bridging were prevalent. When cardiac myocytes were plated at a low density, minimizing cell contact, NE induction of skeletal alpha-actin gene expression and hypertrophy was mediated by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor. Factors related to cell communication may influence the pathways mediating NE-regulated gene transcription during cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.\r"

A factor with apparently indistinguishable sequence specificity can be induced in many other cell types, where it is used to regulate inducible gene expression. For example, kappa B-related sequences have been shown to be important for the transcription of a few inducible genes, such as the interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain gene and the beta-interferon gene. However, these genes are not constitutively active in B lymphocytes, suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms must play a role in determining the patterns of expression. We have investigated the constitutive and inducible transcriptional activity mediated by five kappa B-related sequence elements in two different cell types. We show that in S194 plasma cells the activity of each element correlates well with the relative affinity of B-cell-derived NF-kappa B for that element. This leads to significantly lower transcription enhancement by sites derived from the interleukin 2 receptor or T-cell receptor genes in S194 cells. However, in either EL-4 (T) cells or S194 cells, both lower-affinity sites can be significantly induced by the tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type I, showing that NF-kappa B activity can be modulated even in a B-cell line that constitutively expresses this factor.\r"

A G-to-C transition at the second base of codon 413 in exon 12 of the gene results in the substitution of Pro413 for Arg413 in the mutant protein. This mutation (R413P) results in negligible enzymatic activity when expressed in heterologous mammalian cells and is compatible with a classic PKU phenotype in the patient. Population genetic studies reveal that this mutation is tightly linked to restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotype 4, which is the predominant haplotype of the PAH locus in the Oriental population. It accounts for 13.8% of northern Chinese and 27% of Japanese PKU alleles, but it is rare in southern Chinese (2.2%) and is absent in the Caucasian population. The data demonstrate unambiguously that the mutation occurred after racial divergence of Orientals and Caucasians and suggest that the allele has spread throughout the Orient by a founder effect. Previous protein polymorphism studies in eastern Asia have led to the hypothesis that \"northern Mongoloids\" represented a founding population in Asia. Our results are compatible with this hypothesis in that the PKU mutation might have occurred in northern Mongoloids and subsequently spread to the Chinese and Japanese populations.\r"

In this report we present evidence to support the hypothesis that the activation and the maturation state of the T cell may be important in coupling the TCR to the \"death program.\" We show that coupling of the TCR to the death program is open during maturation but closed in naive mature T cells. However, during primary antigenic stimulation, coupling between the TCR and the death program is reopened, as demonstrated by the stimulation of the death of these cells by immobilized anti-TCR. Our results suggest that further examination of mature cells that are either resistant or sensitive to receptor-stimulated death may lead to the identification of the components of the death pathway and may provide clues to the regulation of their coupling to TCR signals.\r"

It corresponds to an mRNA of 2094 nucleotides. The length of the mRNA was measured by primer-extension of rat pheochromocytoma RNA and the 5' end of the sequence of the mRNA was confirmed by the PCR. A probe spanning the translation initiation site of the mRNA was used to hybridize with mRNAs from various organs of the rat. S1 nuclease digestion of the mRNAs annealed with this probe revealed two classes of mRNAs. The comparison of the cDNA sequence and published sequences for rat liver, human pheochromocytoma, and Drosophila dopa decarboxylase supported the conclusion that two mRNAs are produced: one is specific for tissue of neuronal origin and the other is specific for tissues of nonneuronal (mesodermal or endodermal) origin. The neuronal mRNA contains a 5' untranslated sequence that is highly conserved between human and rat pheochromocytoma including a GA stretch. The coding sequence and the 3' untranslated sequence of mRNAs from rat liver and pheochromocytoma are identical. The rat mRNA differs only in the 5' untranslated region. Thus a unique gene codes for dopa decarboxylase and this gene gives rise to at least two transcripts presumably in response to different signals during development.\r"

The addition of 5 microM guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]) strongly reduced high-affinity agonist but not antagonist binding. Exposure of the membranes to high pH reduced the number of GTP[gamma-35S] binding sites by 90% and low Km, opioid-sensitive GTPase activity by 95%. In these membranes, high-affinity agonist binding was abolished and modulation of residual binding by GTP[gamma S] was diminished. High-affinity (Kd, 0.72 nM), guanine nucleotide-sensitive agonist binding was reconstituted by polyethylene glycol-induced fusion of the alkali-treated membranes with (opioid receptor devoid) C6 glioma cell membranes. Also restored was opioid agonist-stimulated, naltrexone-inhibited GTPase activity. In contrast, antagonist binding in the fused membranes was unaltered. Alkali treatment of the glioma cell membranes prior to fusion inhibited most of the low Km GTPase activity and prevented the reconstitution of agonist binding. The results show that high-affinity opioid agonist binding reflects the ligand-occupied receptor-guanine nucleotide binding protein complex.\r"

The YACs in the yeast cell are \"retrofitted\" with selectable markers by homologous recombination with the URA3 gene of one vector arm. The DNA fragment introduced contains a LYS2 marker selective in yeast and a thymidine kinase (TK) marker selective in TK-deficient cells, bracketed by portions of the URA3 sequence that disrupt the endogenous gene during the recombination event. Analyses of transformed L-M TK- mouse cells showed that YACs containing rDNA or G6PD were incorporated in essentially intact form into the mammalian cell DNA. For G6PD, a single copy of the transfected YAC was found in each of two transformants analyzed and was fully expressed, producing the expected human isozyme as well as the heterodimer composed of the human gene product and the endogenous mouse gene product.\r"

In this report we demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) also regulates PEPCK expression by inducing a 3-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the PEPCK gene. A RA response element located between -468 and -431 in the PEPCK promoter mediates a 7-fold increase in expression of a chimeric construct containing the basal PEPCK promoter ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. This element confers RA responsiveness through the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter and functions relatively independent of position and orientation. An 18-base-pair core sequence (-451 to -434) (i) mediates an effect of RA on PEPCK gene expression and contains motifs found in two other RA response elements; (ii) corresponds to AF1, an accessory factor element that is an integral component of the complex glucocorticoid response unit in the PEPCK gene promoter; (iii) is in a region involved in the developmental expression of the PEPCK gene; and (iv) shows homology to elements involved in the tissue-specific regulation of genes, including the hepatic apolipoprotein genes and the alpha 1-antitrypsin gene.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects cells after binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the cell surface recognition marker CD4. gp120 is noncovalently associated with the HIV transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp41, and this complex is believed responsible for the initial stages of HIV infection and cytopathic events in infected cells. Soluble constructs of CD4 that contain the gp120 binding site inhibit HIV infection in vitro. This is believed to occur by competitive inhibition of viral binding to cellular CD4. Here we suggest an alternative mechanism of viral inhibition by soluble CD4 proteins. We demonstrate biochemically and morphologically that following binding, the soluble CD4 proteins sT4, V1V2,DT, and V1[106] (amino acids 1-369, 1-183, and -2 to 106 of mature CD4) induced the release of gp120 from HIV-1 and HIV-1-infected cells. gp120 release was concentration-, time-, and temperature-dependent. The reaction was biphasic at 37 degrees C and did not take place at 4 degrees C, indicating that binding of soluble CD4 was not sufficient to release gp120. The appearance of free gp120 in the medium after incubation with sT4 correlated with a decrease in envelope glycoprotein spikes on virions and exposure of a previously cryptic epitope near the amino terminus of gp41 on virions and infected cells. The concentration of soluble CD4 proteins needed to induce the release of gp120 from virally infected cells also correlated with those required to inhibit HIV-mediated syncytium formation. These results suggest that soluble CD4 constructs may inactivate HIV by inducing the release of gp120. We propose that HIV envelope-mediated fusion is initiated following rearrangement and/or dissociation of gp120 from the gp120-gp41 complex upon binding to cellular CD4, thus exposing the fusion domain of gp41.\r"

(1989) J. Biochem. 106, 548-551] and a cDNA transcribed from a locus (DNF15S2) on the short arm of human chromosome 3, reported by Naylor et al. [Naylor, S.L., Marshall, A., Hensel, C., Martinez, P.F., Holley, B. & Sakaguchi, A.Y. (1989) Genomics 4, 355-361]; the DNF15S2 locus suffers deletions in small cell lung carcinoma associated with a reduction or loss of acylase activity (EC 3.5.1.14). Acylpeptide hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the terminal acetylated amino acid preferentially from small acetylated peptides. The acetylamino acid formed by acylpeptide hydrolase is further processed to acetate and a free amino acid by an acylase. The substrates for the acylpeptide hydrolase and the acylase behave in a reciprocal manner since acylpeptide hydrolase binds but does not process acetylamino acids and the acylase binds acetylpeptides but does not hydrolyze them; however, the two enzymes share the same specificity for the acyl group. These findings indicate some common functional features in the protein structures of these two enzymes. Since the gene coding for acylpeptide hydrolase is within the same region of human chromosome 3 (3p21) that codes for the acylase and deletions at this locus are also associated with a decrease in acylase activity, there is a close genetic relationship between the two enzymes. There could also be a relationship between the expression of these two enzymes and acetylated peptide growth factors in some carcinomas.\r"

  ".W": "Based on transfection into cells in culture or natural transduction into retroviruses, proto-ras genes seem to derive transforming function either from heterologous promoters or from point mutations. Here we ask how such different events could achieve the same results. To identify homologous regulatory elements, about 3 kilobases of rat DNA upstream of the first untranslated proto-Ha-ras exon was sequenced. Surprisingly, the sequence shares at -1858 a homology of 148 nucleotides with Harvey (Ha) sarcoma virus, 5' of viral ras, signaling possibly a second untranslated proto-Ha-ras exon. In addition the sequence contains a perfect repeat of 25 CA dinucleotides at -2655. A retroviral promoter, even from upstream of the poly(CA), conferred transforming function on proto-Ha-ras and increased transcription greater than 100-fold compared with that of unrearranged proto-ras. Point mutations were not necessary for transforming function of rat and human proto-Ha-ras genes with retroviral promoters but did enhance it greater than 10-fold. A unifying hypothesis proposes that proto-ras genes depend on high expression from heterologous promoters or enhancers for transforming function, which is modulated by ras point mutations. The hypothesis makes two testable predictions. (i) Unrearranged proto-ras genes with point mutations, which occur in some cancers, have no transforming function. Indeed, tumors with mutated proto-ras genes, even those that also lack hypothetical tumor-suppressor genes, are indistinguishable from counterparts with normal proto-ras genes. (ii) Proto-ras genes in transfected cells derive transforming function from heterologous promoters or enhancers acquired via illegitimate recombination from vector DNAs and particularly from viral helper genes that must be cotransfected for transformation of primary cells. Indeed, expression of exogenous proto-ras genes in cells transformed by transfection is as high as for viral ras genes and is much higher than in the cells of origin.\r"

  ".W": "The residues that are indispensable for the ribonucleolytic activity of angiogenin are also known to be essential for its angiogenic activity. We now demonstrate that residues in another region of the protein, devoid of catalytic residues, are additionally required for angiogenesis. Endoproteinase Lys-C or a baby hamster kidney cell protease cleaves angiogenin at the peptide bond either between Lys-60 and Asn-61 or between Glu-67 and Asn-68, respectively. The two polypeptide fragments resulting from either cleavage remain linked by disulfide bonds. These two derivatives and des-(Asn61-Glu67)-angiogenin--in which both bonds are cleaved--retain their ribonucleolytic activities toward tRNA, 18S and 28S rRNA, and dinucleoside phosphates but are no longer angiogenic on the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane. Further, their capacity to elicit a second messenger response in endothelial cells is greatly decreased. Moreover, none of these three derivatives inhibit angiogenin-induced angiogenesis. This contrasts with two active site mutants of angiogenin. These results identify the residues from 60 to 68 as a region of angiogenin that is part of a cell-surface receptor binding site [see accompanying manuscript: Hu, G.-F., Chang, S.-I., Riordan, J.F. & Vallee, B.L.

  ".W": "A 42-kDa bovine protein that binds bovine angiogenin [angiogenin binding protein (AngBP)] has been identified as a dissociable cell-surface component of calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells and a transformed bovine endothelial cell line, GM7373. Binding of 125I-labeled bovine angiogenin (125I-Ang) to AngBP occurs with an apparent Kd approximately 5 x 10(-10) M and is specific, saturable, and inhibited by excess unlabeled angiogenin. 125I-Ang can be crosslinked efficiently to AngBP by a water-soluble carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbo-diimide. Bovine ribonuclease A competes with the binding of 125I-Ang to AngBP, but lysozyme does not. Direct binding to AngBP of 125I-labeled bovine ribonuclease A is, however, much weaker than that of 125I-Ang. Two enzymatically active derivatives of angiogenin cleaved at residues 60-61 and 67-68, respectively, fail to induce angiogenesis and also bind to AngBP only weakly. AngBP has been isolated by treatment of cells with heparan sulfate, affinity chromatography on angiogenin-Sepharose of the material dissociated from the cell surface, and gel filtration HPLC. The results suggest that AngBP has the characteristics of a receptor that may likely function in angiogenesis.\r"

In the present study, phosphorylation of IP3 receptors has been examined with purified receptor protein reconstituted in liposomes to remove detergent that can inhibit protein kinases. The IP3 receptor is stoichiometrically phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) and Ca2+ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) as well as by PKA. Phosphorylation by the three enzymes is additive and involves different peptide sequences. Phosphorylation by PKC, which is stimulated by Ca2+ and diacylglycerol, and by CaM kinase II, which requires Ca2+, provides means whereby Ca2+ and diacylglycerol, formed during inositol phospholipid turnover, may regulate IP3 receptor physiology.\r"

This modification is required for the blood-clotting activity of these proteins and has thus been the subject of intense investigation. We have now identified the bovine vitamin K-dependent carboxylase and purified it to near homogeneity by an affinity procedure that uses the 59-amino acid peptide FIXQ/S (residues -18 to 41 of factor IX with mutations Arg----Gln at residue -4 and Arg----Ser at residue -1). The carboxylase as purified has a molecular weight of 94,000. It is also the major protein that can be cross-linked to iodinated FIXQ/S and is the only protein whose cross-linking is prevented by a synthetic factor IX propeptide. The degree of purification is about 7000-fold with reference to ammonium sulfate-fractionated microsomal protein from liver.\r"

Indirect immunofluorescence staining and polymerase chain reaction analysis of the PC6-induced CEM cells revealed the absence of known lymphokines/cytokines except granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). However, functional studies with recombinant IL-3, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta 1 showed that these three factors did not inhibit HIV-1 replication in CEM cells. Neutralization of the PC6-induced HIV-1-inhibiting factor(s) with commercially available neutralizing antibodies to GM-CSF and TNF-alpha also did not abrogate the anti-HIV-1 impact. Thus, the anti-HIV-1 factor induced by PC6 may be novel. Molecular sieve separation showed that the anti-HIV-1 factor(s) is smaller than 30 kDa. Affinity chromatography using a DEAE-cellulose column enriched the factor that inhibited HIV-1.\r"

  ".W": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), synthesized in muscle and fat, hydrolyzes plasma triglycerides primarily while bound to luminal endothelial cell surfaces. To obtain information about the movement of LPL from the basal to the luminal endothelial cell surface, we studied the transport of purified bovine milk LPL across bovine aortic endothelial cell monolayers. 125I-labeled LPL (125I-LPL) added to the basal surface of the monolayers was detected on the apical side of the cells in two compartments: (i) in the medium of the upper chamber, and (ii) bound to the apical cell surface. The amount of 125I-LPL on the cell surface, but not in the medium, reached saturation with time and LPL dose. Catalytically active LPL was transported to the apical surface but very little LPL activity appeared in the medium. Heparinase treatment of the basal cell surface and addition of dextran sulfate (0.15 microM) to the lower chamber decreased the amount of 125I-LPL appearing on the apical surface. Similarly, the presence of increasing molar ratios of oleic acid/bovine serum albumin at the basal surface decreased the transport of active LPL across the monolayer. Thus, a saturable transport system, which requires heparan sulfate proteoglycans and is inhibited by high concentrations of free fatty acids on the basal side of the cells, appears to exist for passage of enzymatically active LPL across endothelial cells. We postulate that regulation of LPL transport to the endothelial luminal surface modulates the physiologically active pool of LPL in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Mammalian cells have been encapsulated in agarose microbeads, and from these cells metabolically active permeabilized nuclei were prepared. Previously, we showed that biotin-labeled monoclonal antibodies against Z-DNA can be diffused into the nuclei and, over a specific concentration range, they will bind to Z-DNA within the nucleus in a concentration-independent manner. By using radiolabeled streptavidin, we showed that the amount of Z-DNA antibody bound is related to the torsional strain of the DNA in the nucleus. Relaxation of the DNA results in a decrease of Z-DNA formation, whereas increasing torsional strain through inhibiting topoisomerase I results in increased Z-DNA formation. Here we measure the influence of RNA transcription and DNA replication. Transcription is associated with a substantial increase in the binding of anti-Z-DNA antibodies, paralleling the increased level of RNA synthesized as the level of ribonucleoside triphosphate in the medium is increased. DNA replication yields smaller increases in the binding of Z-DNA antibodies. Stopping RNA transcription with inhibitors results in a large loss of Z-DNA antibody binding, whereas only a small decrease is associated with inhibition of DNA replication.\r"

  ".W": "Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) induces T-cell lymphoma when inoculated into neonatal mice. This is a multistep process. Early events observed in infected mice include generalized hematopoietic hyperplasia in the spleen and appearance of mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) recombinants; end-stage tumors are characterized by insertional proviral activation of protooncogenes. We previously showed that an Mo-MuLV enhancer variant, Mo+PyF101 Mo-MuLV, has greatly reduced leukemogenicity and is deficient in induction of preleukemic hyperplasia. In this report, we have examined Mo+PyF101 Mo-MuLV-inoculated mice for the presence of MCF recombinants. In contrast to wild-type Mo-MuLV-inoculated mice, Mo+PyF101 Mo-MuLV-inoculated mice did not generate detectable MCF recombinants. This failure was at least partly due to an inability of the MCF virus to propagate in vivo, since a molecularly cloned infectious Mo+PyF101 MCF virus did not replicate, even when inoculated as a Mo+PyF101 Mo-MuLV pseudotype. These results show that the leukemogenic defect of Mo+PyF101 Mo-MuLV is associated with its inability to generate MCF recombinants capable of replication in vivo. This, in turn, is consistent with the view that MCF recombinants play a significant role in Mo-MuLV-induced disease and, in particular, may play a role early in the disease process.\r"

  ".W": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV exhibits extensive genetic diversity and it is apparent that an infected individual contains different populations of distinct viral strains, a large proportion of which has been found surprisingly to be defective for replication. A similar phenomenon has also been observed with some cell lines that are known to produce infectious viral particles but harbor defective proviral genomes. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of this phenomenon by cloning proviral genomes of HIV from a cell line that was capable of producing high titers of biologically active HIV particles that readily induced syncytia with CD4+ cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes. This cell line was found to contain five proviral genomes, all of which, when tested individually, failed to produce replication-competent viruses upon transfection into human cells. However, when a specific combination of two proviral genomes was used in such transfection studies, it was possible to obtain biologically active, replication-competent viral particles that infected and replicated in CD4+ cell lines and induced syncytia characteristic of HIV. Such a result may be due to homologous recombination between proviral DNAs occurring in cells after transfection and/or complementation of replication-defective proviral DNAs. The diploid nature of the viral RNA genome present in the viral particle may enable the persistence of defective HIV genomes.\r"

This immunodominant NP peptide is recognized by Sendai virus-specific CTL that are known to have therapeutic effects in vivo. By subcutaneous immunization, this peptide induced Sendai virus and NP peptide-specific CTL memory responses in vivo. Most importantly, mice that had been immunized with this peptide were protected against a lethal virus dose, indicating that viral peptides can be used as antiviral T-cell vaccines. The induction of T-cell memory by free peptide immunization potentially has wide applicability in biology and medicine, including protection against infectious disease.\r"
